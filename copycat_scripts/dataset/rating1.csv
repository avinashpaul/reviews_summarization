B0013FRNKG	I just received this IPad, and it looked fine, just slightly worn. However, when I went to charge this I had to force the connector in because the charger would not fit inside the port. It also took over 12 hours for the IPad to fully charge... will return.	1	electronics

B0013FRNKG	Becareful when you purchase products from walker and walker. I purchased 2 ipads from them a white one. Which it had a screen protector on it and when i went to take it off the actual screen started to crack and separated from the ipad itself. So i requested a return and sent it back. Then i purchased a black ipad and i went to get data put on amd the guy at the phone cpmpany told me that this ipad was reported lost or stolen. So i contacted amazon and explained what happened. Then i went down to the police station amd made a police report on this. Very bad and i will never buy from then again.	1	electronics
B0013FRNKG	iPad came with damages on 3 of 4 corner. Back piece has a clicking sound, like there is a gap in between the glass and metal. And I cant turn it on because the charger they gave me is a lightning cable but the iPad takes the old school kind	1	electronics
B0013FRNKG	We ordered this iPad for our son. The speaker is blown so we have to replace it and it made for a lousy birthday.	1	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I was disappointed when I received this item, I had bought it because it said that the quality was very good. In fact, it looked like it was dropped and banged in one corner, the metallic back was slightly dented. First time this happens to me with amazon!	1	electronics
B0013FRNKG	It comes with a different device charger and I had to buy a new charger by my own because I open it while Im outside the US.	1	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I have had this iPad for a couple of months now, and I can say it DOES NOT WORK. One trip from Comcast to check my wifi in my house, two trips to the Apple store, and a lot of frustration later I can say that this thing won't connect to any wifi. I am very disappointed considering it was supposed to have been double checked.	1	electronics
B0013FRNKG	LOCKED. This item is locked by Este Lauder and is unuseable	1	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I ordered this product thinking I was getting a new iPad at a great rate.  What I found,  was a second generation iPad that cannot update any further.  It was not working with certain applications downloaded.  I wrote to this company explaining this.  They were nice enough to have me send it back with everything that was included.  They sent me another iPad, but did not send the charger and cord with it.  I now have an older model iPad without the cord to charge it.  Since they have returned the iPad to me I have wrote to the 2 times and I have had no reply.  I would not suggest purchasing anything from this company again.  It is sad to think I spent the same amount of money for an older generation model as I could for a newer model.  I feel duped.	1	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I wasn't given the correct charger!!!	1	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Horrible!!!  This Ipad should have been sold for parts only!  I will post pictures.  The screen lifts off and was wiggling when I was holding it for the first time.  Scratches and cracks everywhere, it has definitely been dropped, maybe a child's toy even.  It arrived dirty and I immediately took a disinfectant wipe to it.  Disgusting and disappointing!!	1	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"- DO NOT PURCHASE -

Overview:
- Bad customer support
- Devices COULD be stolen, no way to know for sure
- Overpriced, since a brand new iPad is only $40 more.

Details:
Bought this iPad 2 a while ago and it just stopped working. Had to bring it to the Apple store to reboot it and then the iPad had an activation lock on it from the previous owner. The only way to unlock it is by either contacting the previous owner and hope that they are willing to share their Apple ID and password with you. Which, for the record, no one will do. The alternative is issuing a hard-reset, which requires a valid proof of purchase (i.e. receipt with serial number).

When you purchase a device from this retailer, they will NOT issue a receipt with a serial number. There is no way to know for sure whether the device you buy is stolen, repurposed or marked as lost. When you receive an iPad that is stolen, scrapped or lost, it will become completely useless to you and you will have wasted $270. Just don't do it.

DigitBargain has a simple return policy; they don't do it. Aside from the 'sketchy' their device management practices, their customer service is equally useless. They barely speak English and completely fail to understand any issue you may experience. As a matter of fact, they have actually stopped responding to my emails. I am very surprised that this retailer is allowed to sell on Amazon, I thought there were standards.

Anyhow, I received a nice $10 promotional code from Amazon for my 'inconvenience' and unfavorable experience. Thanks, Amazon!

Did I mention that you should not purchase an iPad from this company? Well, you shouldn't.

B0013FRNKG	Purchased used - like new from warehouse deals.  iPad constantly crashes on all apps. Email, Amazon, candy crush.  It doesn't matter what I am using it for, it crashes.  Never buy used items from warehouse deals. Works long enough for the return window to close and then you are stuck	1	electronics
B0013FRNKG	It would be much better if it took a charge.  I tried 3 different charging cords, but still can't get a charge.	1	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Glue that connects the screen is coming apart, when I push on the home button, you can really notice it. Home button doesn't seem to work all of the time. The charger that came with it is hard to connect and doesn't always charge it. Had it plugged in all night and didn't charge at all. When it does charge, it takes hours to get to 100%. I wanted something to take with me on the go instead of packing up my Mac but I learned my lesson and will just buy something new.	1	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I bought this iPad on May 31 and now it will not work anymore. I can't get the screen to light up like its suppose to. All that shows up is the time when you turn it on. Sure wish I could get a refund or a replacement would be even better. I don't suggest buying from this seller.	1	electronics
B0013FRNKG	My special needs nephew received this as a Christmas gift; however, his parents where holding it for when his currently iPad died.  Recently, they opened it to charge it but the product would not charge.  They took it to an Apple dealer who examined it and found out the logic board is bad.  There is no way to fix it.  He NEVER used it.  I tried to contact customer service for the seller and they have not returned my call.  We are so disappointed.  This was a VERY expensive purchase to receive defective merchandise.	1	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I don't know what's wrong with this iPad, but it's not what was advertised. I sincerely regret leaving it in the box until just now, because now I can't return it and unfortunately it's my son's birthday so his big present is ruined. We have an iPad 2 already that's perfect for the kids to use - I bought this second iPad 2 just for my son to use, and it's slow, the resolution is poor, and most importantly it can't support any of the games I downloaded. It's obviously not the same as the one we already have. I don't know what it is. It can't even open Safari without flickering back the the home screen after trying to load a page.
Waste of money. Extremely disappointing. Ruined my son's birthday surprise. Ruined my day. Will never buy from this seller ever again."	1	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I just received my refurbished iPad and was excited to use it. Unfortunately when attempting to register the iPad the previous username and password were not wiped out.

I have two other iPads and neither of them perform that way.  I have an iPad identical to this one and it never did what this one does.  I am even wondering if this one you sent me is new as advertised.  What are you going to do about this
problem?

The item was not acceptable as a gift from Santa... buyer beware. Completely worn out back plate, main button not straight and installed right, edges are all chipped off or bent.

I asked for a retuen and was given a ""canned"" answer and pushed out the door.

Site did not provide example of ""their"" definition of damage. If we saw this one the site we would have clicked to the next option in a second."	1	electronics

B0013FRNKG	I bought 2 of these tablets for my two granddaughters age 2 and 6.  The tablets were great, but unfortunately the cords that were included were some cheap third party cord and not at all compatible with the iPads.  They looked fine, but when I put them in the iPads to recharge them after loading them up with Apps, The 2 iPads were swell, but the charger cords are not compatible.  When plugged in the iPads went nuts, jumping from app to app and almost screwing them up.  Fortunately I own an iPad2 and used my cord to recharge the gift iPads, but I had to buy 2 new cords from Apple at a cost of 19 bucks each!  I feel very ripped off right now!	1	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"Where to start.. This came in a box with the iPad sitting on the bottom of the box, with the padding on top.. There a clue how this review will go:
1) the wifi adapter was NOT working, had it trying to connect to multiple devices, wifi @ work, hot spot (T-Mobile), home wifi. It would sometimes briefly connect then drop as if stick in search mode, it would not stay connected. I had it sitting next to the hot spot and it showed 1 bar reception. Take a literal 3 steps away and it sees nothing...
2) Seller tried to tell me she got on Netflix with it before she sent it, I have the emails from her. Uh, no liar you didn't do that. I'm a programmer, I checked. Who are you fooling?? Is that a believable story to you??
3) The glass screen was not properly installed, the rubber seal behind it was coming out of the body (you shouldn't see this at all) and it literally had 2 HAIRS IN THE SCREEN!! What the what?Eyelash length, and disgusting. Furthermore, I could literally put a sheet of paper between the screen and body of the iPad on one corner. If I could upload the images from my phone I would (no option to). Just like people seeking attention who tell you they are ""crazy"" are not (and we know that), this ""honest and strait forward"" seller is far from her opinionated self-title.

I did get my money back, but I always see justice through (meaning it was a process). I'm not the type of person others get over on. BUYERS BEWARE."	1	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"Unit worked for two weeks and then went completely dead.  There was not damage to the unit, it was not dropped nor did it get wet or anything else.  I know the unit is at least two (2) or more years old and probably set around it some store house.  I wish to return it and have it replace or I am willing to upgrade.

B0013FRNKG	"I bought this unit to replace another which I had for 3 years.  That unit served me well until I dropped it on concrete :(

This new Ipad did not work.  It turned on, and WIFI worked, but the screen was not touch sensitive 60% of the time.  Constant lock-ups.

It is set up to return to Amazon's partner.  Thanks Amazon for making this return so easy!"	1	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Received defective item. Reset it, stayed on the phone with Apple for over an hour, finally got time to go to the Apple Store and they said it was not under warranty and they could not help. The iPad screen would lock anytime I tried to type something. Super embarrassing as this was a Christmas gift and the intended recipient could not even enjoy it. Don't waste your time- order from a more reputable source.	1	electronics

B0013FRNKG	If I could give no stars on this vendor I would. The product that I received was so old that after a short period of time, it just stopped working.

If you can't . I understand. Then just return my money. Thank you. God bless. Pat	1	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Unfortunately I had to return it. It was defected. The touch screen was loose. I would touch a letter and it would type multiple letters on it's own.

B0013FRNKG	I recieved this on Dec 23 and now 4 months later it will not charge. Took it to the Apple store and they said it cannot be fixed. I paid $220 to use this IPad for 4 months. Major rip off- very upset.	1	electronics
B0013FRNKG	After receivoing the unit I could not connect with the internet, I suspect because the unit arrived minus a sim card. I attempted times to contact the vendor  but each time was put on hold for 30 minutes so finally gave up.  I have since taken the unit to a registered Apple repair facility, minimum charge $125 and asked them to put the unit in operating order.  By the time all is said and done I will have paid the purchase price of a brand new Ipad!  Do not buy anything from this vendor as you willo not be able to contact them after the sale if anything is wrong.  I know that my wireless network is not the problem as I can connect to it with my Apple computer and my two Android devices.	1	electronics

B0013FRNKG	Wrong product came	1	electronics
B0013FRNKG	As many of you know iPads generally aren't cheap. So when I found this one at such a good price, I found it a little odd that it was so cheap, but it was a deal I simply couldn't pass up. BIG MISTAKE. The product was defective from the moment I got it, but after syncing it with iTunes and several hours of work I finally got it to activate. After that it worked fine except for a few minor bugs, but I generally never expect an electronic device to work perfectly. But after several months it started shutting down until finally it collapsed altogether. I took it to several repair stores, but there was nothing that could be done. I tried to return it, but the return date had long since expired. Finally I resorted to mailing it back to Apple. I was given a replacement product, and have been extremely happy with it. I beg you save your time and money and avoid this seller at all costs. The iPad is absolutely great. The seller......not so much.	1	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Product arrived on time but would not connect to wifi or computer. Complete waste of time. It supposed to be reconditioned... I guess by that they meant it would turn on because that is the only function it could perform. Without the ability to access wifi or the iTunes Store we couldn't even complete set up. 	1	electronics

B0013FRNKG	When I received the product it seemed to be in perfect working condition. I then tried to setup the iPad and realized that I could not connect to the Internet. To make a long story short, this product was manufactured in China and for use in China. The model # is MC980CH/A not the MC980LL/A listed as what I purchased. I am very upset about this as I am unable to connect to WiFi and thus this iPad is useless to me. I will be returning immediately.	1	electronics

B0013FRNKG	iPad was not used, not new as advertised. Wasn't even in an Apple box with guides.	1	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The iPad was poor quality. It had dots in the screen and chips out of the corners. A piece was also taken out of the back and filled in with a small piece of metal. I highly discourage anybody from buying from this seller.	1	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Worked fine for the first year.  After than things went downhill.  Screen would not rotate after a year.  Tried restore and every other suggestion on Apple site.  Nothing.  Year and a half volume control went out with volume at zero.  Only way to hear is via headphones.  2 years after, completely dead. Will not turn on.  When I do a Restore, it goes through the process but stops at the registration and shuts down.

Now, I know some are thinking that we are hard on this iPad, perhaps, but that assumption is incorrect.  My mother, a senior citizen, uses it for word find puzzles and to facetime me.  If you want something that will last temporarily, buy this.  If you want something reliable to keep for a while and get your moneys worth, don't buy this."	1	electronics
B0013FRNKG	There is something wrong with this iPad that of course didn't start happening until a few days AFTER I could return or exchange it sadly. I didn't begin to use it until I needed to and that was only a few days ago. When using the apps/programs they just poof, shut down in the middle of typing or working. It's a shame, the iPad 2s I've used that convinced me to purchase this one have been wonderful, so I guess I got a dud for some reason. I'll be more careful when purchasing from now on...	1	electronics
B0013FRNKG	It was truly worn out, it even cracks just when holding it. It has multiple dents, the glass is cracked, and the table cracks for just being held. I was expecting better conditions.

B0013FRNKG	"I LOVED my iPad 2, but ONLY with iOS 7, which Apple stopped ""signing"" after the iOS 8 ""update"" came out in 9/14.

This is very important: The iOS 8, and the subsequent ""fixes,"" were never meant for the older generations like this one (they greatly impair the functionality of older gens).

What this means: You must stick with the factory iOS provided with the 2011 release - after that, you're in Apple's rear view mirror.

I can appreciate skepticism of reviews, so please check out the forums to verify anything I've said here (Googling ""iPad 2 slow after update"" or ""iOS 8 ruined my iPad 2"" will illustrate this).

It is very frustrating to have my once seamlessly running device get ""updated"" into obsolescence, then to have the company I trusted turn a blind eye.

They expect me to upgrade to a newer iPad, but I'm looking forward to voting with my dollars elsewhere.

To preempt the Apple PR machine, I will say it again: Just check ou the forums. They've made a lot of people very upset."	1	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"I purchased the Apple iPad 2 from this seller, and come to find out that it was locked, so I was unable to gain access, and use this item. After taking it to the Apple store, I found out that the serial numbers on the item, and on the box did not match, and they were VERY hesitant to touch it.. considering that it may have been stolen. The seller was contacted and refused to do anything to reimburse me for the upwards of $400 + that I have spent.
I caution anyone who is considering purchasing an electronic item, to first, consider buying it new, and DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS SELLER..! whatsoever.."	1	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Worst purchase ever! I wish I could give it no stars but I won't be able to write a review. The ipad2 was a FAKE! Every time I order a electronic from Amazon there's a problem!  I will not order any more electronic from Amazon again this was my second time , it won't be a third!  I know it's a fake because my daughter got a Ipad2 for her birthday two years ago.  It's such a big difference. The Ipad2 doesn't show on and off it shows green for on with no words. I didn't order it for my self and I told the person who I purchased it for he said it's ok. I called customer service all I got was smart remarks. I was told ""we have other sellers so we don't know about the products that are being sold"". So I asked how you sell something on your site that you don't know about?  Her response was do you want a refund?  Never Again with Amazon! I just feel everyone should know be aware of your purchases with Amazon because you might not get what you asked for or you think you payed for!"	1	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I know that nearly everyone loves the I Pad, but I don't.

There are no directions, messed with it for a couple of days and couldn't figure anything out.  Did not like the virtual keyboard and not about to buy a real key board  as a keyboard was not going to make me understand the technology. I probably needed to find a teenager to show me how to use it.

If you did not grow up with computers, or like me, older,but only familiar with Windows I would suggest finding someone to help you with the I Pad (just in case)"	1	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Apple confirms that this iPad was previously sold in November 2013.  Amazon represented this as new (the invoice says Condition New, brand new factory sealed.  According to Apple, the serial number of this device confirms previous registration.  The serial number is automatically read when it connects to iTunes.	1	electronics

B0013FRNKG	I purchased this iPad for my 73 year old aunt a few months ago.  She never used it, then my iPad 3 was stolen, so she returned this iPad 2 to me to replace my stolen one.  I activated the iPad this week and found it to be a horrible unit.  I would return if I could.  It is SLOW, the screen freezes and a real pain to use.  I am hoping that someone will trade me this piece of junk for another iPad that works better.	1	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I bought this because my friend always talks about how much she loves hers. I tried using it to read email, but typing replies is so awkward. I tried surfing the web but many websites don't offer all features in their striped down mobile version. I tried watching movies but didn't enjoy it as much as my big screen with surround sound. So it sat on my coffee table, mostly unused, for 2 weeks before I sent it back.	1	electronics

B0013FRNKG	This is a piece of trash.  BEWARE of buying used items.  The Ipad was to have been received by Feb 28th.  It was not mailed from Ohio until March 7th and received March 12th.  The case and screen hare held together with a piece of plastic tape.  There are three cracks in the screen.  There is no charger included.  I am out almost $250.00 for someone's garbage.  There should be some type of recourse for a buyer in cases of this type,  I guess I could try Judge Judy.	1	electronics
B0013FRNKG	this item its used!!!! it was already opened, didn't brin any manual, or the key to open the sim card tray, its alrady configurated, it just brougth the stickers im so dissapointed, this is a fraude, the ipad has scratchs in the back. its supposed to be a brand new. but its not!!! this is a scam!!!	1	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Not impressed. I was typing an email and the screen went black. I did all that I could and it wouldn't go back on. Brought it to the Apple Store and they couldn't revive it. Lost all my info and all that money. The warranty was over of course. Not at all what I expected.	1	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"After the last update the iPad lost all my docs. It partly restored some from the backup file, but the most important ones are missing.

They screwed up and want to make money on it!!!!  I don't like that... I'm going to get rid of their products!!! APPLE SUCKS!!! DON'T BUY THEIR ""RELIABLE PRODUCTS""!!!

B0013FRNKG	When i opened the iPad I configured the iPad, but suddenly the iPad turn off and don't want to turn on. I tough, that when you revise a device you test it in so many ways that the costumer get satisfied, but this one is didn't get all the tests. Even the charger overheat. I knew was used but when you sell something used you should sell something good.	1	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Was advertised ""like new"" - looked  ok until I tried to adjust the volume, unable to set, then I noticed a large dent around the volume switch. The volume goes up and down and the switch does not respond. This item was certainly not like new defective."	1	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Bought this unit at another retailer several years ago. Happy for quite  a while, then something happened to ability to connect to home wifi network. All other devices in house continue to work fine. That includes laptops, tablets, printers, DVD player, and Roku. Searched for support online. Found forums full of similar complaints. Lots of potential solutions but none has worked for me. Even purchased an extender for wireless router. As it is I have to sit on floor in front of the router or the extender to get more than a single bar and to access anything including Amazon. I used device to watch Amazon movies on Prime, will not be continuing Prime subscription since this POS won't connect well enough to view anything. Of course it does not have an Ethernet connection so I can't even wire the paperweight to the internet.
No apparent solution from Apple in the works as they appear to not recognize the problem is an iPad problem.
I believe Apple IOS updates have degraded the capability. Probably a corporate decision in order to sell new devices or sell devices with 3G/4G so continuing revenue stream come in from the ISP subscriptions.

I can't believe the lemmings in the Apple market let this company get away with the stunts they pull."	1	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Hate it i don't recommend it.  i bought a lemon Ipad 2..............The seller should have describe it was USED AND ITS YEAR OR 2 OLD and the charger was not in a very good condition. I had to buy a new charger for the Ipad.	1	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"Be careful!!  I received this ""new"" iPad yesterday...turned it on, but the screen was completely blank! Called Apple support and they kindly walked me through the restore porcess...which did not work unfortunately.  I now have an appointment at the Apple store today for them to see what the problem might be.  The really weird thing is the ipad had a user name on the setup screen that was displayed on my macbook. as if soneone else owned this ipad before.  I thought I was buying a brand new iPad, and I paid full price.  So it should not have been used before, right?  Is Amazon/ShopVius selling referbusided products on the cheap or just unknowlingly doing so through a second party??  Not a good business practice Amazon!  Buy from Apple directly if you desire their products.  Safer by far.

What I ordered wasn't what I received! ! BLINQ sent me a 1st Gen Ipad. I couldn't believe it until I cross referenced the model number. Yup, paid for an ipad 2 and BLINQ sent me an ipad 1st Generation. Definitely not what I ordered nor what I paid for. Let's see how BLINQ and/or Amazon handles this and I will update but as of now, I will NEVER order from BLINQ again.	1	electronics

My son was very dissapointed about this on Christmas . There was nothing written in the review about the camera not working ( I would have never purchased if it was stated ) now apple wants 250.00 to fix the problem.	1	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The Ipad did not have a working operating system.  This is not our family's first Ipad but our worst purchase.  Will not buy from deal2u again.

B0013FRNKG	"The one iPAD 2 I received was great.  However, I didn't receive the ""two"" that I ordered.  Instead, the vendor has said they sent ""two"" and has blamed it on FEDEX.

You try to explain that to a 5 year old!  I am waiting for my credit card to be credited for the one I didn't receive.  Still hasn't been done yet.  GRRRRR and sad."	1	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I thought I'd try the iPad despite disliking most apple products. This item proved to be just as awful as other apple products I've had. Too expensive for what you get and is so restricted to Apple's dictator style software. If you love apple you'll probably love this but if not you'll dislike it just as much as I do.	1	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"I ordered a black 64 gb ipad 2 to replace my previous iPad 2 of three years because I broke the screen.
I received a product made for Korea.  I couldn't read the directions and I received a plug adapter for Korea. Secondly, I asked for WIFI only, but I received one with cellular with no SIM card.
This was sold by a third party approved by Amazon. I made the mistake of not looking further into the third party. This was sold by TechGiant.  I highly recommend staying away from this seller!
Being a college student, I thought I was getting an awesome deal and saving money. Lesson learned: do your homework and research the third party or go at your own risk."	1	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The battery sucks so bad.  I have to keep it charged in constantly, and even while the screen is on and it's plugged in, the battery still dies...it's the weirdest most awful thing, especially since I got the iPad thinking that it would be stable for business purposes.	1	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"My IPAD2 was good when I used IOS6. After upgrading it to IOS7, the WIFI on my IPAD2 stop working. The IPAD see the weak signa only when I sit by the router (around 3 feet). There is no signal if you move away. If you search google by ""WIFI issue on IOS 7"", you can find that a lot of users have the same issue as what I have. After 2 days discussion with Apple support, the solution is to spend $240 for a replacement.

My IPAD is still pretty new even it is out of warranty. Why do I have to pay couple hundred dollars for the problem caused by using Apple new IOS? Apple made a bad IOS release and you can approve this by searching on Google. However, now Apple is tring to provide a workaround for the issue caused by Apple at the user's cost. This is a very bad business practice.

Are you still going to buy Apple product if your new device fail to work in your next upgrade and you have to spend several hundred dollars to get a replacement even it is not your fault?

I would suggest those who is consider buying apple product to wait until you make sure that your next update will not cause such a big problem."	1	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"My wife bought a supposedly new iPad 2 via Amazon which was supplied by the iPad Shop.  When I tried to register it Apple said it was out of warranty.  Long story short, this iPad ended up being a replacement for another unit sold by he iPad Shop back in 2011.  They received a replacement from Apple and sold it to my wife as new in September 2013.  While it might have been new it was recorded by Apple as a replacement to the original owner and thus received the warranty only at the time of return -- which by 2013 had long since expired.  Further, the serial number on the box did not match the serial number on the iPad.  After a back and forth with Apple customer service I finally ascertained that this was a replacement iPad intended for someone else and sold as new by the iPad Shop.  Apple's serial number tracking confirmed this.  It might have been a new unit but Apple changes the serial number on units they replace and would not warranty it beyond the ""original purchase date"".  Bottom line:  Go directly to Apple for their equipment.  That said, I'm not real pleased with Apple for failing to warranty an obviously new unit just because they assigned a new serial number to a customer who never received it.  I returned the iPad and bought another directly from Apple -- I'm not sure why.  Basically, I'm not pleased with either Apple or the iPad Shop.  But I am pleased with Amazon who noted that there have been similar complaints from this vendor and quickly refunded the purchase price.  Just beware of the iPad Shop."	1	electronics

B0013FRNKG	The device set up is devious. I got just one chance to enter my Wi-fi password. I did so correctly, but it was quickly denied with a recommendation that I set up the iPad up using iTunes, another piece of Apple related software. If you don't have access to a computer-- tough luck! I downloaded ITunes onto my computer, connected the iPad, and low and behold, this time it accepted my Wi-Fi password. Could it be that I was manipulated to get iTunes loaded onto my computer? And while I was about it I had to uncheck opportunities to download other Apple software that I don't want.  Anyway, the iPad screen device lit up, finally! If the iPad had eyes it would have seen my scowling face, but I pressed on and eventually set up my e-mail account. The clock on the iPad face was wrong so I tried to change it. That should be easy right? Wrong! Internal clocks gave correct time for all over the world, but the clock on the icon was wrong. Hmm, I thought I'd better look at the manual, which of course is not included with the product. However, the tiny info card that comes with the iPad says it's available on the Apple web site. Ah, ha! I found it. But it wants to know what software is in my iPad. If there's an easy way to determine that, it escapes me. I suppose it's in the manual but if you don't know what manual to look for, you have the perfect catch 22. Anyway I made a guess and looked at the manual. There are 137 pages. At this point I decided the iPad is not user friendly and I'll return it . . . as soon as I've found out how to remove my e-mail password now stored somewhere within the iPad type 2 with software type ????	1	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"I received my iPad 2 and loved it for a few months. Take note that I am severe o.c.d. here, therefore, there is absolutely no way it got wet or dropped or any other sort of freak accident occurred on my part to hurt it, as suggested by every single troubleshooter out there. It started ghostwriting and not responding correctly to where it was being touched... So I checked out my warranty situation and of course, being that it was a present that was bought months previous to my taking ownership of it (via a belated birthday gift) but never taken out of the box, not that that matters to Apple, I was told I would have to pay full price to replace the touch sensor which I found out recently is such a serious problem with Apple that they (if they cared about their consumers, that is) should have recalled it long ago.. I am already tired of talking about this. I am just getting angry about it again...

I had the same sort of problem when I received an iPod shuffle for an Xmas gift years before.... The people I know with Apple computers can rarely read discs I send them and the friends I have with iPhones have all switched back to droid types...

I do not know why this brand is so popular but I will never buy from them. And I would like to take this opportunity to thank Apple for ruining a few gifts for me. Some really good hearted people spent a lot of their hard earned money to buy me thoughtful gifts which, thanks to your lack of consumer courtesy and a tendency to charge way too much for inferior products, turned out to be complete flops.

As an extra added insult (to me, not you)... I am writing this on my friend's iPad 2 (the same as mine, that he bought about the same time as mine) He beats this thing mercilessly, gets it wet, steps on it, drops it, lets his toddler do horrible toddler things to it EVERY SINGLE DAY and guess what? This sticky disgusting thing never misses a beat for him.

Go ahead and laugh."	1	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"SELLER NOT EVEN WORTH ONE STAR
Honestly, I own the ipad 2 and I love it (AFTER I REPLACED MY FIRST ONE). But if you're considering ordering an ipad from armelectronics2011, THINK AGAIN. When I bought my first ipad 2, the listing was for a brand new still in box product. When I received it, the ipad was NOT in its original box (as I anticipated) and after a couple of months, I started to realize that the ipad 2 that I had purchased from armelectronics2011 was complete CRAP. I'm pretty sure that the screen on the ipad I had bought was actually replaced in a very unprofessional way and in time, it showed because the white ipad began to turn yellow. The home button did not work correctly, the glass began to peel away from the actual ipad, and the entire ipad began to act as if it had a virus (which apple products supposedly do not get viruses). When I contacted the seller about their false advertising for their ""brand new product"" it took two days of phone tag to even contact them, and even when I FINALLY talked to them, they basically told me ""oh well, not our fault, you can pay the return shipping and a restocking fee to get your money back"" -which by the way is not at all worth the trouble after all of their unnecessary fees for something that was THEIR FAULT. I in the end kept the ipad 2 from this seller (REGRETFULLY) and eventually bought a new one.
Basically, if you want to splurge for an ipad of any sort, go for it because in my opinion it is worth it. But if you're planning to purchase from this seller, PLEASE don't. Really. Do not get ripped off in the way I did. You are truly better off buying an ipad(any generation) for the full value."	1	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"I wanted to know what I was missing and apparently it was my money.

You're dependent on iTunes and it's junk. Apple products are said to be easy to use but they don't live up to the hype. iTunes expects the user to know what to do. There are no clues as to how it should be used. All of that money and they can't even afford tool tips. I've spend an hour trying to figure out how to put a PDF into my iPad and it's like pulling teeth. A simple task made difficult by a bad design. Why can't I just drag and drop the files using Windows explorer like every other hardware product in the world? Why so difficult?

Apple had an edge when they were first to market. Now they're relying on the loyal base and offer no advantages. Pay more and do less. Still no USB or SD card slots? It makes every task difficult.

Good for browsing the web and checking email but not much more.

I had to try it and regret the purchase.

Simple tasks could be A LOT easier.

------------------------------------------------------------------

After wasting another hour of my life I finally figured out how to put PDFs onto this piece of junk. When I first started iTunes there was only one menu available and it was hidden under a graphic in the upper left corner of the app. I ""Added files to library"" from the menu and selected my PDFs. This made them appear in iTunes under Books but it didn't put them on my iPad even after several syncs and prayer.

The solution(of course) was to select Show Menu Bar from the first menu to get a second menu (File, Edit, View, ...), then I could select View Side Bar to get a third menu I needed to add my PDFs. The first screen they appeared in was also labeled Books but it is obviously something different. After doing a sync the PDFs didn't appear in the Acrobat Reader where I expected them(why would they?) and I eventually found them in iBooks.

The PDFs still won't appear in either of the PDF apps I installed.  Why not? This makes absolutely no sense. Easy? No.

I tried using the iPad search feature but it can't find the PDFs that are on the iPad even though they show up in iBooks. The files are there. Why doesn't search find them? Because iPads are over priced JUNK! Basic functionality doesn't work.

Apple products are supposed to be easy to use but they are far from it.

Very disappointed.  Not designed well and lots of room for improvement. It makes me wonder what they've been working on for the last few years. It wasn't usability.

The more i use it, the more I hate it.  This weekend I received a message from iCloud Backup that has rendered my iPad completely useless.  When I tap OK to dismiss the message it keeps coming back. I can't dismiss the message, I can't interact with any apps, I can't power it down, I can't pull the battery. What am I supposed to do? Is this why everybody goes to the Apple store?"	1	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I love Apple devices! I already have an iPad 2 and bought this one for my daughter for Valentine's Day.
When it would not connect to any wifi network, it was tested by a technical expert who determined that this iPad is damaged, probably by water exposure.
I hope to get my $475.75 back...so much for purchasing refurbished Apple devices through Amazon!
My next refurbished Apple device will be through Apple.com, where it will have a decent warranty, etc.
It may be more expensive...but well worth the cost, when considering not only the money, but the risk.
There was a considerable expenditure of time and effort to try to set this piece of junk up, and then to take it in for testing.
There was also the extra money spent to have it examined and tested.
Not to mention the disappointment of not having this gift for my daughter on Valentine's day."	1	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I was very disappointed when my grandaughter opened this christmas gift, and it was damaged. We could not tell it was damaged,until she opened it. Of course she could not play it.
I returned it on Dec. 28, 2012, and was told they would send a replacement. I have tracking records that say they received it on Jan. 3, and signed for it.
Now I got an email this morning, saying they do not have the unit.
I have ordered a LOT of items from Amazon, and this is the very first problem I have had. The problem is with ANGEL SELLERS, who sent out the damaged I PAD.The product was bent on the side, and it could not be used . What a letdown
for our grandaughter, she was so happy when she opened it, then found out we had to return it. Never thought it would take this long to get resolved."	1	electronics

Fundamentally it's a closed system of applications that are all 'one trick ponies'.  (Most are lame.) Each time you need to do something it's buy another app.
I'm not convinced it even works properly.  There are issues with the screen not responding to touch.  It also has problems connecting to Wi-Fi and to iTunes via a PC.  When connected to the PC there are messages that it can't sync or that the iPad is unrecognised.  I-Tunes is an appalling waste of time and had its tentacles onto my credit card before it was even installed."	1	electronics

B0013FRNKG	The company treated my return expeditiously and was very courteous.  The product was well wrapped and shipped in more than adequate protection.  The glass was new and the back was used as per the description.  The back was chipped severely on all sides like it fell from a moving bicycle--it should not have been used.  Under the glass was a dark splotch about 2x4 inches.  Its wasn't subtle--it was a glaring defect.  Once turned on, the splotch selected whatever was underneath it.  Apparently there was not even the breifest of efforts given towards quality control.  The tablet was unusable.  A horrible disapointment.	1	electronics

Now I know the old Kindle doesn't really have the features of the Apple IPAD 2 but, My Kindle is going on two years old and I really stopped useing it when I got my IPAD 2. But,furthmore my Kindle is still not broke, damaged, nor has any loss of batterie life,but it's A totally different story when it comes to the IPAD....First of all I have got say I took extremely great care of my IPAD but, somehow within 3 months it started to show scratches of the back of it. Moveover, it about the fifth or sixth month of owning my IPAD 2 It fell of a three and a half foot table(on to carpet) and the whole screen just shattered, the charging port was also almost totally destroyed and the little circle button that which is 100% the most important part of the IPAD even working at all was destroyed completely. I Called Apple and Asked if they could possibly fix my IPAD 2 64GB oh yea which my parents spent $730.00 dollars for and guess what they said........no, come on keep thinking-_-....................... they said ""for another $400.00 bucks we'll give you a new IPAD 2(the same one White/64GB)and we'll of course transfer the data from your other one to the new one."" Well,as you could imagine my parents were't about to do that so I was and am stuck with a half broken IPAD and no way to fix it thanks Apple! It wasn't a total loss intil, I couldn't even use my IPAD anymore which happened about two months ago. Now since I can't use the Circle part of the the device I have to turn it off just to switch programs!! I end up now just useing my laptop for everything. I have IPOD and that's great but, APPLE's IPADS' suck badly.

B0013FRNKG	"An iPad-2 (64GB) purchased by me a year ago stopped working in May 2012 despite having been barely used. Apple, by necessity, replaced it at its Reston, VA store. That brand new replacement iPad failed again within just 4 months (Serial number DKVHG0MNDFJ0). The Apple store in Reston VA refused to fix or replace it, hiding behind a claimed ""3 month warranty for (new) replacements. (ref. its store manager, Ingrid H.), even though it was less than 5 months old.

Anyone thinking of buying an Apple product should decide for themselves if they want to buy a product from a company that refuses to replace it a mere 5 months after it was obtained new from that company.

FOLLOW-UP 10 MONTHS LATER: YET ONE MORE HARDWARE FAILURE THAT APPLE REFUSED TO REPLACE

A new Ipad-2 from Apple's Reston, VA store failed again, 10 months after it was bought brand new directly from Apple. This time it was the main camera. Again, Apple refused to replace it even though it was a brand new product that failed within 10 months from purchase. Apple's self-service reasoning was again that the product, which was bought at a slightly discounted price FROM APPLE because of the previous reported hardware failure, had only a 3 month warranty (even though brand new).

That adds up to three iPad 2's with 64GB that failed within around a year, often much less than that and Apple refused to repair or replace them at no charge.

You can draw your own conclusions."	1	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Update -- dropped rating from TWO STARS to ONE STAR after upgrading the iPad 2 to iOS6

I got the iPad for a great price, that's the only reason why I bought it. If this was $20 more, I would have bought a 7"" Android tablet instead.

Soon after receiving this device I found out:

-This device is essentially a brick, unless you jail break this device. (YOU CANNOT JAILBREAK IPAD2 running iOS6)
-The Safari web browser does not support Adobe flash (YouTube and pretty much all other videos online)
-Most aftermarket ""iPad accessories"" that were NOT made by Apple will not work with this iPad (error message:""accessory not supported"")
-you CANNOT use a SDCard/USB drive with this iPad as extra storage with camera connection kit
-The iPad can ONLY read certain file formats (avi mov tiff jpeg mp3 mp4 flv)
-There is no File manager for this device

Instead of jail breaking this device, save your money and buy another tablet for a little less money. You will not be missing anything special from the iPad, but you will gain a LOT with another tablet. Most newer tablets support SD cards as storage devices, and plays practically all file formats - that's pretty much standard.

I thought APPLE was blazing the trail for others to follow, now I see that Apple is severely behind the competition with basic features.

Overall: I have so much buyers remorse for buying this device, it'll probably end up on eBay (w/ the case) to get my money back.

Sincerely -  An un-satisfied customer,

B0013FRNKG	Two months into owning it the glass got cracked and had to be replaced.  I had to replace the glass on an Iphone once before, not a big deal, totally different story on the Ipad.  I used a heat gun to soften the glue, but it seemed to just spread the cracks. A million flakes of shattered glass later, it was repaired, but it was by far the most difficult electronics repair I've attempted.  Apple will repair the glass for $199-$399, depending on the trim level of the Ipad.  Not only is that expensive for what essentially is a sheet of glass, but it's doubly insulting that the cost of the glass depends on how much the Ipad originally retailed for.	1	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"I bought an Apple iPad 2 from UK 3 months back.

At the time of sale, Apple doesn't mention a very important and critical maintenance aspect of few of its products that is, they do not have a part level

replacement policy.

This I have come to know after contacting the Apple india support. The head supervisor there confirmed that the policy and design of Apple is such that it

leaves no options with the customer, but to re-buy another piece even if the touch screen is cracked.

In my case, the screen got cracked due to keeping the iPad under my pillow after my night time reading. They requested me to send the picutures of the cracks

and said that the cracks are due to external pressure and hence do not come under warranty, leaving me with no other option but to not use the Apple iPad

anymore due to safety reasons. I am left only with this option because I don't want to buy another same product in its replacement. I can as well buy similar

product from other company's offering.

I even offered to give back the product and give me atleast some money. But they said that Apple doesn't have repurchase policy in India.

In addition, the other known Apple issues like unable to play videos ( due to non compatibility of flash player), low sound, no external ports provided like

HDMI, USB etc. The maintenance is also a rip-off. Please note that you will have to buy seperate Apple accessories if you desire to have ports to connect

with other non-Apple devices. Even the sound is low to inspire customer to buy external speakers. The intersting thing is that other similar products in

market have these things built in.

Having burnt my hands after buying my first ""Apple"" product, I have decided not to buy any future Apple products and highly recommend not to waste so much of anybody's hard earned money to buy such a product. I only wish I had this piece of advice before...."	1	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"I am beginning to lose all respect for Apple. The file transfer system on the iPad is a joke. They want to make it as inconvenient as possible to transfer files from a PC (or anything else) to it. Apple wants you to use iTunes, of all things, to transfer files. This from a company that invented Drag n Drop. They also don't want to support Adobe's flash player. So once again the customer suffers.

By the way, Apple should treat it's workers with a lot more respect. When workers start jumping off tall buildings, maybe you could give them a short break."	1	electronics

B0013FRNKG	I am writing this comment on a two month old iPad that is now a piece of crap thanks to the very expensive Griffin  case that I purchased. It was the most expensive case that Target carried. The case will not open without inserting something in one of the open slots and twisting. When I did that, the screen exploded so that I have cracks running in all directions. I have purchased a new computer from Apple every year for nearly 15 years. I have 4 iPad and an iPhone plus software and I have purchased at least 20 iPods.  I have tried returning the brand new iPad to both Target and Apple. Both dogmatically refuse to help me. Apple said I would have to pay $200 to replace it.  So far, no response from Griffin.  I am sick over this. Apple is horrible in terms of their customer service now.  The used to recognize stuff like this.  I have had so many good experiences with them over the years and now they've stopped standing behind their products.  The iPad should not have done this and the case should not have been so difficult to open.  The Apple store made good and sure that I couldn't buy an extended warranty by documenting the fact that the iPad was cracked.  I am crying as I write this because the good that this company once was is now dead. I loved them because they were always recognizing my loyalty to them and in return showed that same dedication to me.  Now that's dead.	1	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The product itself is excellent, but if you order from this seller be sure to ensure that you receive the correct product!  I ordered and paid for an AT&T 3G model with WiFi, thinking I would primarily use it on WiFi and then activate the 3G when needed.  Then I went on vacation a few months later and tried to activate the 3G only to discover that the iPad I received was only a WiFi model.  When I contacted the seller they said they couldn't even find the serial number in their records and were of little assistance.  It was like buying a car with heated seats in the summer, then in the winter you discover the heated seats aren't in the car.  Very frustrating.  I have subsequently learned that you can tell the difference in a 3G model by the black antenna across the rear of the device.  Be sure to verify that you receive the correct model as soon as you receive the product!	1	electronics

I think its great, nice design, and fast duel core processer. If your friends are just begging for you to buy an ipad, go ahead and buy it. But if you really want a nice tablet, I would recommend a samsung galaxy tab 10.1 [Which is personally my favorite android tablet on the market], asus transformer prime, acer iconia a500, or the HP touchpad.

 In all, im just not an apple fanboy."	1	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"The pixel density on this tablet is good enough to get good smoothing of the font edges. Yet, the iOS doesn't do well here. In result, reading PDFs is impossible as it causes some serious strain on my eyes. I have 20"" LCD HP crap that has ~3 less pixel density. Yet, the font edges are as good as on this IPAD. Huh.

I see IPAD3 fixes this problem, but not in the iOS but with better screen - good for marketing since not many people even see any difference. In fact, people say the screen is not worth it. Huh. Makes me think if I got the eagle eyes or maybe there is a few million people who simply don't know nothing.

If you don't need PDF, well, letters in Safari are terrible too.

Also, I cannot believe there is no LED behind the Home button. There is even that dark square in it where LED could fit (like on HP touchpad). So, carrying it next to me, like iPhone, and checking email frequently is the way to go? That's ridiculous. If I am not using it, it's on the stand, not withing my reach. That's where LED comes handy.

Also, when I click on Mail icon that shows new email, it opens inbox, instead the email. - few clicks more are needed to see the email. Terrible approach if you plan to use multiple accounts and receive many emails.

Finally, Notification bar is not popping-up new messages when I am working on ipad. Why? Status bar is there all the time - showing some small icon when new message arrives would be completely unobtrusive.

In summary, message/email communication interface is years behind Android. And yet, all that is needed are few minor changes.

I was hopping that external adapter can serves as additional storage. At least read-only. But no, you can only import stuff from there. Import where? To 16GB memory? From HD camera? Ridiculous."	1	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"The iPad alone I would give 4-5 stars to.  Since there is no way to separate the service you get with this device, and the device itself (and once you get this particular model of iPad, you are most likely to be using AT&T (T-mobile is slower)), this device gets a really unfair rating from me.  Go look at the Verizon version.

The good:
Easy to use, light, rugged.  Great apps.  The software and apps just ""seems to work"" as compared to the two Droid phones I've owned, which crash, do weird things, are sluggish when first turned on, etc. etc.  Based on this, I would not recommend an Android tablet to anyone except the most Technoholic Open Source types.

The bad: (blame AT&T, and spineless government oversight)
I bought this because I would like to use it if I ever go overseas.  Since Verizon chose to go it alone with CDMA, and the regulators let them do that, you are stuck  in their little prison if you want to switch carriers.

...So I was told by Apple that the data service would be easily turned on and off like a faucet, and that I would only have to pay for the months for which service was enabled.  Great!  I buy it in December, immediately use it ""off-campus"" in Albany on Christmas vacation (no internet at my Dad's if you can believe it...)

Sometime during Dec/Jan, I call AT&T to get them to help me figure out why I can not get in to the Settings->Cellular Data->My Account feature.  First call was probably 15-20 minutes long, and the AT&T representative is clueless.  It was like I was asking for help with my Acme Moon Lander.  I suspect it would have been news to the rep that AT&T actually has millions of iPad customers who pay them monthly.  In fact enough customers that AT&T should be able to escalate to iPad expert reps.

Call two: Again 15-20 minutes, this time the rep is much more adamant that this must be an apple screen (though he could not explain why the AT&T death-star logo was on the screen I was having trouble with.)

Just to play along, I call Apple, and waste some of their money and more of my time.  They quickly confirm this is not their problem.

I finally figure out although it would be a nice-to-have to check my account out this way, I can go to their web site, and log in.  It takes me a surprisingly long time (about 20 minutes) to figure out how to ""suspend"" my service.  By this time, I've waited much too long, and I'm going to have to pay them for January, even though I had not used it then.

OK, I pay my bills, and now I get a new bill for Mar 25 thru Apr 25.  Whot?  My service is suspended, why are they still billing me?

Now the reason for the dud star: I call AT&T, and get Rep one.  They are very nice, and explain that even though I have suspended my service, I still have to pay.  What I really wanted to do is cancel my service.  Huh?  This is not sounding too much like a faucet anymore.  She suggests that what I REALLY want is what she calls ""Session based"" service.  She can not do that for me, but she will connect me with someone who will.

I get put on hold where a recording LOUDLY tries to sell me a new Samsung tablet, repeatedly tells me I can  ""Re-think the Possible"" with AT&T.  Let me tell you, I've starting to rethink how badly customer service can possibly be at this time.  ....Oh yeah, and there is something in there about not wasting my time too.

Rep number two:  I recount my tale of woe,  but she will not have any of it.  First of all, I better get it straight: she does not know where this ""Session based"" phrase I'm throwing around came from, but I better get it straight.  Its called pre-paid, and we will hence-forth ONLY call it pre-paid, so we both know what we are talking about.  OK lady, you're the boss, Pre-paid.  How do I switch my account to Pre-paid, and how do I get this bill cancelled?  Well it turns out they can not just flip a software switch on their end.  The type of service (let's just call it a billing plan) is determined by my SIM card.  You've got that right: even though it is just a stupid serial number in a database, I've got to haul myself down to an Apple or AT&T store to get a new SIM card, so that they can bill me differently.

Apparently WAY back when, when I first signed up with AT&T (which I think I did on the phone because the web site was too confusing), THAT is when I went off the rails.  That is why my Settings->Cellular Data->My Account feature gives me a weird error which three different AT&T reps have not been able to help me with.  This woman was annoyed with me, and clearly thought it was all my fault for getting myself in to this predicament.  ....But she could not give me help with my bill.  Onward:

More annoying ""commercials"":  you know if this Rep loudly read the scripts from these commercials while we waited for the next rep, it would be considered really rude, and nobody would put up with it.  Give me the elevator music please.  I am not calling AT$T because I've got money burning holes in all of my pockets to buy another tablet, I am calling because they are not billing me the way I was promised.

Rep number three: I again recount my tale of woe (more quickly this time, so I don't p*ss him off).  Since I'm now in to minute 30 of this call, and that last rep was really testy with me, I'm now asking them to forgive three months for service not consumed.

Guess what?  I tell this guy I apparently should have signed myself up for Pre-paid service way back when, and that is why I am here now, and he says: ""Oh you mean Session-based service?"", and proceeds to use the ""Session-based"" term that Rep #2 reprimanded me about for the rest of the conversation.

So AT&T: you are just awful.  When I communicate with you, you use the term ""Phone Number"" when it is not a phone. And I can not make phone calls (or text as far as I know)  You allow me to suspend my service, but you still charge me the same money, whats that all about?  Your own people disagree on what terms should be used for the billing plans.  And we are not talking innocuous terms like ""pop"" vs. ""Soda"", because this is how I got in to this mess.  I signed up for the wrong service, and I suspect it is because your poor discipline with terminology.  And that original error message, why give me a mis-leading error, just put up a screen which say ""You have got a XXX plan, and this info is not available under that plan"".  Cancel/Suspend, Pre-Paid/Session-based. Phone Number/device number.  ""Invalid account""/Wrong plan type.  Pathetic. And I mean pathetic, not ludicrous, or shameful, or awful.  Pathetic."	1	electronics

I'm giving this a one-star unless this business backs up their end.  Otherwise, I would highly discourage you from doing business from this place.  Quite the unhappy buyer right now.  At this point, I wouldn't trust them as far as you can see.  If I hear back from this company, depending
on how they decide to deal with returns to their business, will depend on whether I leave it at one star or bump it up to a business upholding good customer service."	1	electronics

Do not buy for children! In fact keep away, they will break something too expensive. Also, if you drop it the screen will shatter at least the Nook Tablet has plastic covering around the LCD screen. In Addition you might enjoy reading more on a 7 in. tablet rather than a 10 in. screen. Furthermore, I like the Nook Tablet and the Kindle Fire much more than a lousy iPad!

B0013FRNKG	"Although the product title says ""IPAD - Newest Model"" if you look at the tech specs this is not the newest ipad that was announced March 7th.

Buyer Beware."	1	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"My roommate got this device and he is marginally pleased.

Cons:

1)DRM infested Apple handyourwallet device
plagued with limited connectivity.

2)No replaceable battery.

3)Too expensive for the hardware used in the device.

4)Proprietary devise that expects you to be faithful
to Apple and their apps store.

5)Easily slips from your hands unless you get a protective
case.

6)No sd or micro sd card slot in wi-fi only model.

7)Unstable and Apple provides bad support even if you buy the
extra care plan.

8)Apple techsupport has been less than honest and frequently lies.

9)Apple does not have the same support mechanism for people who purchase the device from Amazon and this can be a problem at times.

10)iPads don't run Flash based content.

11)You can't run Java on an iPad or iPhone and there are still thousand of web sites and corporate applications running Java.

11b) Because of 10 and 11 above, that means you won't be able
to properly navigate close to 30% of websites in the internet since Java and Flash are still widely used.

12)Apple is so intent on push marketing, like the Genius function in iTunes, that it interferes with basic functionality.

13) Even the Kindle Fire  does a lot more than the iPad and it is a proprietary device.

14)Apple store personnel is extremely arrogant.

15)Apps that one can receive free on an android, you have to pay for via the app store.

16) iPads are disposable electronics. If your iPad breaks, Apple will give you a refurbished iPad if your warranty is still in effect. If your warranty has expired then your only option could  be to throw away your Ipad or sell its parts on Ebay.

17)Apple forced Amazon to remove the Kindle Store button from their mobile devices. They have also done this to the Barnes & Noble Nook Application.

18)iPad2 probably has the worst operating system ever. The system is so restrictive it limits any chance of even limited productivity. If you're only interested in playing games, email or rather poor quality photo images and video then you'll probably like the iPad2.

Pro:

1)Long battery life.

2)Good screen but no need for such a high resolution
given its size.

3)Support from Apple store if you are near one.

4)Widely used.

5)People think it looks good.

6)Shiny.

7)People who don't know much about technology are impressed by the device.

8)If you have lower than average IQ you will find this product easier to use than a more tweekable Android tablet.

All in all my roommate wishes he had gotten a Toshiba Thrive because he would like more freedom and does not want Apple breathing down his back asking for money at every turn.

===============================

Concerning the retina display of the New iPad:

March 18, 2012 (I unfortunately was forced to post an update to this because my roommate thinks people can benefit). He heard about Apple's new iPad and wanted me to give him some ideas of what techies thought of Apple's retina display in the new iPad. So I went to a website I read frequently and one that is popular with the most technologically literate people on earth: tomshardware dotcom. I am including
some of the comments voted highest and left by tomshardware frequent readers. It is hoped that this will assist
intelligent readers on deciding if they should get the new iPad.

Halcyon:

""Why didn't someone besides Apple use this most excellent screen first? Heck, Samsung makes the screen...you'd think they put something as nice in their own tablets.""

------
Bystander:

Frankly, I find it a little ridiculous at the resolution of this screen. I'd rather have the extra battery life and if you use it for games, they are probably going to have to use it at half the resolution for performance reasons.

2550x1600 on a 30"" is about as crisp as i can see. Why do we need that on a 9.7"" screen?

I won't refuse the added resolution, but I'm not sure there is much reason to spend extra money for it either.

------

Icemunk quoted by Del35:

""Back in 2010 when Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone 4, he claimed that the human eye stooped discerning the individual pixels when the pixel density is 300ppi. Hence he called the display on the iPhone 4 the retina display, which has 326ppi. Now we go forward in time almost two years and after all the human eye stops discerning pixels at 260ppi not 300ppi as previously stated.

Also the phone I mentioned was a Nokia N900, at the time I also had a iPhone 3GS and a Xperia X1. Without knowing I had two phones with retina displays.""

The retina display is such a load of nonsense. The hype is designed to draw technologically subliterate zombies. The bottom line is that I simply can't imagine using a device like the new iPad that prevents me from experiencing fully close to 30% of websites due to its proprietary infestation (no flash and no java support!). On another note, I am happy that Samsung manufactures the retina display for Apple. Obviously they see no need to create a hype around it and seem not to be pushing it on their devices. For me the 1280 x 800 Pixel Super Amoled display of the the Samsung Galaxy Note is more than I need. Thanks but no thanks Apple. Give me connectivity, openness, and produce a device with a better that 2 in 10 repairability ratio and thus almost impossible to repair, also throw in a micro sd slot and price the device reasonably and I might consider it. Till you do that you will just be producing overpriced junk for  zombied morons using your logo as a shield.

End of story.

Icemunk:

""Fact of the matter is Apple displays are nice, and set a good benchmark, however they have been surpassed by newer technologies and better resolutions on many fronts. Most new super phones surpass 300ppi using LCD, OLED, and LED technologies.""

-----
Icemunk:

""Yup, Samsung make excellent handheld displays!

----------

Vladislaus:

""My old phone with 3,5 inch 800x480 apparently also has a retina display long before Apple introduced it with the iPhone 4. Apparently all of a sudden, retina displays became much more common overnight.""

----------

The Dane:

""Apple's retina displays still uses IPS panels. Much prefer lower resoution SuperAMO LED if image quality is important.""

--------

Icemunk:

"" There are plenty of phones with ""Retina"" display (above 300 ppi). For example, the Samsung Galaxy Nexus has a 4.65"" OLED screen with 316 ppi, however it is not advertised as ""Retina"" display, because that is a marketing gimick which Apple has a copyright for. OLED beats LCD hands down by the way.""
-------

Shaod:

""Of course it has 316 ppi ""strictly speaking"" - ppi being simply the number of pixels it has per inch. That's ignoring that PenTile actually looks (subjectively) better than a regular display of the same resolution, while using less power because it has few subpixels.

And sorry but 'retina display' is a marketing term. Like you point out it is completely subjective upon other factors such as where the screen is held and how good the eyesight of the user is.""
-------

Icemunk responds to Watcha who  seems to work for Apple:

""You sound like a person who has little experience outside his Iphone and Apple products.. that is unfortunate, I believe you are caught up in the marketing of Apple and confusing it with science. It's tough to be a truly critical thinker when you are a fan boy unfortunately... hopefully you'll realize this in time. Good luck.""
-----

Icemunk responds to Apple employee Watcha:

""I'm not going to argue about what a ""Retina"" display is, because that is a marketing device which Apple holds copyright. If you would like to argue facts, than I will present them to you:

OLED is a superior display. Lower power, higher clairty, better viewing angles, true blacks and superior contrasts, higher resolutions, more advanced, higher quality, vibrant colors. LCD does not compare, even if you make up some marketing term about ""Retina"" display. OLED wins hands down, no matter how you spin it. And just so you know.. Apple won't be using LCD in their next Iphone, Samsung will make them a nice OLED display for it instead.""

Del35 replies to Icemunk:

-------

""Watcha is unforuntetly lacking in real knowledge, and lost in the vast marketing machine produced by Apple. He reads his ""science"" from websites such as[...] which talks about nothing but Apple.. I feel for people like him, they don't realize they are being manipulated by marketing.""

I agree. In fact Watcha is even lacking in the basics of logical reasoning as evidenced by many of his past comments. Watcha does not even know  what  a contrapositve statement is or what a converse statement is or what  a tautology is. To illustrate his total lack of logical skills,  I recall a discussion with Watcha where he/she claimed that Apple made better product because more affluent people purchased them. I replied to him that his argument was akin to the claim that slavery was a better economic system because wealthier people held slaves in the 17th and 18th Century. He could not see the fallacy of his claim and held to it. Now it is known that Watcha works for Apple. So he is just working to put food on his table albeit in an immoral and anti-intellectual  fashion.

B0013FRNKG	I recevied this as a gift and right from the start it was was confusing to use and to controling (can't even set it up without it asking you to conect to the internet so you log on to istore). Everythingis icloud, itunes, istore etc is icrap. basiclly Apple wants you to but everything. Poor memory and I just hate everything about. Took it back and got a Sony Vaio instead. Bottom line either you love it or hate and you know where I stand. Apple uses child labor and you support it by buying their garbage.	1	electronics

B0013FRNKG	I give this a one star for customer service. Apple didn't even get to first base with me. I ordered an iPad2. Gift for my wife. After ordering and getting my email confirmation I noticed that the engraving was wrong. I called customer support with a simple request to change the engraving. Bear in mind only 10 minutes has passed since I ordered and called CS. Their response, too bad so sad. I said it's only been 10 minutes, they said sorry they really get these out fast. I responded that they need to tell their engravers to slow down! Anyway, I tried to cancel, again too bad so sad, you'll have to go through the return process. IF APPLE CANT TAKE CARE OF THIS SIMPLE PROBLEM FOR A NEW CUSTOMER, it stands to reason they won't back their product and the CS is worthless. Can't wait to get my ipad so I can return it and to never return. So beware, I'm sure this is a great product but don't expect any thanks or CS from Apple.	1	electronics

It does not copy and if it does it's 50/50 chance of it working. My kid has a tablet kindle and it does a lot more than the IPad.

B0013FRNKG	"My father ordered this item knowing nothing about ipads (neither did I for that matter.) My mother received the ipad 2 16 gb wifi while she was out of town for Christmas. She opened it expecting to add a data package upon returning home. She called Verizon who said that they were unable to add a data package.

She then contacted Apple. Apple stated that it was originally intended to be sold in a Spanish market, not the US and was surprised that the ipad had not been in Spanish.

After reviewing the correspondance received after ordering this product, I contacted Worldwide distributors to return the item as my mother would like a data plan with her ipad. I was informed that since it was opened I would be unable to return the item.

So...
To sum it up my father spent over $500.00 to purchase the item my mother wanted more than anything, except for the return of her son that died from cancer five months ago, to have an ipad that she can only use in a wifi area.

Again, do not purchase from their seller. Had to look for over 15 minutes on the site for the return policy. Again, the return policy was not in the correspondance received from the distributor."	1	electronics
B0013FRNKG	If you buy from Apple, the 3G is either $15 or $25 per month as the SIM is included, but if you buy the ipad with 3G from anyone else, you must go get the microSIM card from either ATT or Verizon depending on what model ipad you purchased.

I realized the battery was not charging on the USB port in my computer. Checked the info in the search engines, and it turned out i was not alone, totally disappointed because i was never informed about that.
Called Apple which confirmed the same but said they did not have to disclose this info before purchase, and that "" I should have asked if it charged in the computer ""!!!. I could understand asking for OS specifications, software, etc, but not if the darn thing was charging in the computer, like my other Apple devices and Blackberry, including the Playbook that charges fine.

I travel a lot internationally, and i rely on the seat charger port to charge my tablet. After all, the Ipad 2 is a portable device. So I asked them to at least recognize the flaw and to send me the adpters for foreign countries i visit constantly. The answer was from the supervisor : "" NO way. You can purchase the adaptors for $81.00 or get a refund "", and a refund i sure got by sending back that device.

With this type of attitude of superiority, and the tragic loss of their genius, I don't give more than 5 years for Apple to face the music. What a shame. Apple thinks it is a top Fashion Haute Couture House "" by appointment only "".

B0013FRNKG	"This is perhaps the biggest ""trendy"" waste of time and money yet. I, like a lot of other sheep, went out and quickly spent about $650 on this thing. Then I was told by Apple,for an additional $150 I could get two years worth of technical support which I gladly gave up. What they did not tell me was that I would have to be on a complete LEARNING CURVE( which they did not even understand themselves!) to use this product. First, let me say, don't waste your money on any Apple technical support gimmicks. I had some valuable notes stored on my Ipad 2 to do a convention with about three days before this happened. I went to Apple technical support because my e-mail did not work on my Ipad 2. Then they instructed me on how to delete my notes and ""wake up my e-mail"". I said, ""won't I lose all my notes?"" She said ""No, one has nothing to do with the other"". My response was ""Are you sure? I really need these notes for my speaking engagement at the convention"". She said ""No way you'll lose anything. Trust me"". What she should have said is: ""I'm an Apple tech support person, who gets paid by the hour, and it's no skin off my nose if you lose your notes or not!"". And that's exactly what happened. As per her instruction....I lost all of them. I was devastated. I had to spend days,scrambling to recovering at lease some of my lost notes. I will never get back what I lost...ever. I didn't know that everything on an Ipad 2 had had to be backed up to a REAL COMPUTER(notice I said: REAL COMPUTER). I was never told this. Now, that there have been so many failures and complaints about this product I understand they've created a thing called ""cloud"", which does the same thing....backs up your files. You will do better to buy a smaller version of a laptop and don't fall for the nonsense,like I did, that this is a great buy.....because it's not.
Wondering if my e-mail was ever fixed? After spending six hours on the phone with Apple and completely losing my notes and going through the process to ""restart"" my e-mail 6 times..... guess what? It still doesn't work!!! If Apple tech support is the standard for which other companies should model themselves,then we have NO STANDARD. I feel very ripped off."	1	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Boy, am I ever glad I updated my iPad1 to IOS 5. Not only did Apple lose my backup during the update (causing me to restore the whole ""system"" from scratch), but now it runs EVEN SLOWER than the last iOS 4 update.

  Hasn't anyone else noticed this?

When I updated it to iOS 5, I said to myself, ""If iOS 5 runs even slower or causes any other problems, I'm going to throw this thing out the window. Well, not going to do this, but I'm REALLY going to recommend AGAINST the iPAD to anyone interested in getting one. Can't take iPad or iPod seriously--even for music since I'm still trying to fit all the music I had on the iPad before which I can't fit now, after restore. And I can't put music on my iPad OR iPod Touch which resides on an external flash drive, which iTunes CAN play, but my iPad and iPod Touch cannot.  And iTunes syncing is all screwed up. Choose the wrong option and IT WILL DELETE all your music, apps, photos, etc.  NOT like it used to BE.  ;...(

AND...I hate touch screens. Ironically, you CAN'T touch them. (As MC Hammer once sung, ""Can't touch this."") Any slight brush with a stray finger makes it do something you don't want it to do.

AND it doesn't run FLASH (Apple doesn't allow it), so I can't watch FLASH-based videos or see anyone type of FLASH-based web content on an iPad.

B0013FRNKG	"[[ASIN:B0013FRNKG Apple iPad 2 MC769LL/A Tablet (16GB, WiFi, Black)

IPads are way overrated.  I received the IPad 2 as a gift from my daughters.  When I first opened the IPad2, it was WOW.  Now that I have used it for 2 weeks, here is my opinion.  It SUCKS.  No offense to the IPad lovers.  Here are the reasons:

The IPad2 lists at $499 with a puny 16GB memory.  After you load a few apps, your memory is down to say 14 GB.  There is not much you can hold with only 14GB...music, videos, pictures nowadays eat up a ton of memory.  If you want a higher memory, you have to buy the 32 or 64GB, at $599, and $699 respectively.  And even so, the last time I had a 64GB storage capacity is when I had my Atari Computer back in the 80's (ok..i'm exaggerating..but you get the point).  Apple calls 64GB a progress?  And some people hail Steven Jobs as the great innovator?  This is going backwards in time.

The IPad storage capacity is NOT UPGRADABLE.  You have to sell the old one and buy a new one.  This is how Steve Jobs made a lot of money, off of a lot of unsuspecting customers.  What puzzles me is why do some continue to patronize such marketing program.

There are a few things you can do to overcome the small storage, such as, carry a bunch of SD cards, preload it with files and use the camera kit to view.  Some suggest using an external harddrive which you again have to preload with the files you intend to use.  Others suggest using online data storage which you have to pay, somewhere between $10-30/month, and mind you, you have to be online to access these files...so if you do not have WIFI or 3G access, you are SOL.

If I have to do the above to gain storage, what have I gained from IPad2?  I thought the IPad2 is about ease of portability?  Not to mention the additional money one has to spend on the additional accessories.

The 3G data capability adds $129 to the IPad2.  Bear in mind, you still have to subscribe to the 3G data.  If you are on the go, the 3G would be helpful.  However, the 3G is not all dependable depending on where you're at.  The 3G signals in China, Hongkong, and Macau were unreliable.  In mainland China, I was able to get ""some"" 3G data, but none is HongKong and Macau, even when there were strong signals....something to do with prioritization...they give their local subscribers priority, and you get the scrap signal (This is according to T-Mobile).  Maybe this only happens in China.

IPad has NO ethernet cable connection.  While it appears that more and more places are now going WIFI, there are still a lot of good hotels using ethernet cables.  Sometimes you have to go to the lobby (a great inconvenience) to get your best WIFI signal (so, being able to use the ethernet cable in the room would be more convenient).  And there are still a few hotels that don't offer WIFI.  Then what?  You are SOL, unless you bring your own WIFI router.  So I ask again, if I have to bring a router for these rare occasions, am I not defeating the purpose of the ease of portability?

The IPad2 was not able to open a video clip from my Canon T2i (format is .mov).  Later I hear Ipad only supports apple video formats.  It does not run Flash based content.  It does not run Java.  What the?

I still thank my daughters for gifting me the IPad2.  At the least it brought me up to date with technology...I know what I'm not missing...I can say I know what it is...and I can speak intelligently about the Ipad...it's overrated."	1	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"While I was viewing the iPad, I attempted to get advice from the seller/ Amazon regarding te type of device needed for use in South Africa. The options given were eith Verizon compatible or another network----there was no option pertaining to using a 3G card or sim card in countries other than the USA.
I mistakenly ordered the Verizon compatible iPad and then immediately tried to cancel the order.  In less than one minute, I was told that the order had been shipped and could not be changed.
I now have an iPad which as cost over $800.00 which I cannot use in South Africa.
I am an extremely good Amazon customer but am very disillusioned but the service and availability of advice when making a major purchase.
It is neither cheap nor is it value for money"	1	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"We bought the I Pad2 from a big box warehouse store.  The sales person owned one and loved it.  She demonstrated it convincingly.  Our experience has been different. It is difficult to operate.  First it is hard to get acquainted with.  Few instructions come with it.  One has to find the information on line.  It is a lengthy PDF file that is not user friendly.  One needs to read through it carefully.  It took a while to find the on switch.  When it opened there were no apps on the screen.  With no information it took several minutes to learn by trial and error how to slide the screen to find them.  Synchronizing with one's computer is not explained except in several different sections of the instructions.  Getting connected to a wifi router is another mystery to be solved.  There are thousands of ""free"" apps that turn out to be advertisements to buy what you really hoped for in the download.  Books are difficult to down load and don't appear on one's bookshelf but are in various locations.  Paper books are more appealing now.  I can share a paper book.  Though it costs more it gets more value out of it.  The ""10 hours"" of running time is really 10 hours unplugged.  Over all it is frustrating to use and not worth the price."	1	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The IPad2 does a good job of accessing internet and for reading books.  It is quick and has a high quality visual display.  The issues are that it has no Flash Player, which accounts for about 20% of the internet content I wish to view and thus must access with my PC, and it does not work well to develop, or modify documents and spreadsheets.  High priced for a quick web viewer that only works 80% of the time!	1	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"My IPad2 probably has the worst operating system I have ever seen. I wonder at how something so weak could be so popular. I now see why there are so many Apps available that use work-around methods to try to make up for the lack of a more complete system.

I bought an Apple II in the early `80s and soon had to learn to use workaround routines to produce acceptable results. When the IBM PC became available I bought one and discovered what a well-executed operating system was like. I used Microsoft DOS for 8 years before changing to Windows 3.1 which was slowly developed into the present Windows 7 version.

It looks like Apple is repeating the same cycle with the IPAD2. The system is so restrictive it limits any chance of even limited productivity. If you're only interested in playing games, email or rather poor quality photo images and video then you'll probably like the Ipad2. I will admit it's very stylish which is probably a big help with sales but you can't tell a book by its cover.

B0013FRNKG	"Most people are aware that iPads don't run Flash based content.
IPad has its own YouTube browser to compensate for this design flaw.
However, no one mentions that you can't run Java on an iPad or iPhone!!!
There are still thousand of web sites and corporate applications running Java.
Java is still #1 or #2 language in the world for developing applications.
Because Apple had an internal war with Adobe and Sun, the consumers suffer and received a product that has a limited feature set.
Check with this url [...]

Steve Jobs has been quoted as saying ""Java's not worth building in. Nobody uses Java anymore. It's this big heavyweight ball and chain.""
What is interesting to know is that Android phones and tables are running mostly Java applications... so Java is really not dead, but Apple is pretending to ignore the competition like they did in the 90's and think that Microsoft Windows was only a passing fad..."	1	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I received Ipad 2 as a gift.  I already own an Imac, a Macbook and an Ipod. Points to consider:
- I thought I'd put my digital pics on the Ipad, but there is no port, so I can't hook my camera up to it.
- The picture quality of pictures taken with the Ipad was TERRIBLE.
-I would love to have internet access anywhere but the Ipad is too bulky to carry around (and do I really want 24/7 access to email and internet anyway?).
-Watching a movie is uncomfortable, as I'd have to hold the Ipod in my hand in order to see the screen well enough.  -No need to have Itunes on the Ipad as I can't exactly jog with it and the speakers are WEAK.
-The keyboard was surprisingly easy to use, but not as fast a a regular.
- I'd have to buy a case, a stand, and a screen protector if I wanted to carry it around regularly.
-I realize a lot of these issues could be solved in one way or another, but I just don't have the time to figure it all out.  I am quite happy sitting with my Macbook, with a keyboard, a cd/dvd disk drive, a an firewire and usb port!

 I would not suggest the Ipad, especially if you already own other Mac products."	1	electronics

B0013FRNKG	My sister just bought an iPad 2 and I've been playing around with it a little bit. I'm not real impressed with it. I can't see spending the money for an oversized iPhone. It may be more powerful but I just can't get over that feel of it being on oversized iPhone and another trend that everyone will jump on. While the iPad may be fun I would prefer my laptop over this.	1	electronics
B0013FRNKG	BUYER BEWARE - IPADS ARE DISPOSABLE ELECTRONICS. My Ipad broke so I took it to an Apple store, but THEY WILL NOT FIX IT. Instead Apple will give you a refurbished Ipad if your warranty is still in effect. If your warranty has expired then your only option may be to throw your Ipad away. This means that after 13 months (unless you pay for an extra year of warranty then it will be 25 months) you could be flushing $500-$800 down the toilette. Even worse, if you are still under a warranty then Apple will give you a refurbished Ipad which could have 2-3 year old parts in it. An Applette at an Apple store told me that any broken Ipads are sent back to the factory where the unbroken parts are recycled into other Ipads. In other words, if you have a 6 month old Ipad that breaks, you could get a replacement that is already 2 years old. These disposal electronics only have a 3-5 year lifespan and `refurbished' has a reputation of lasting 1 month past the end of the warranty period or 6 months, whichever is a shorter period. If you are one of those that just has to have an Ipad then buy the cheapest one, otherwise buy the competitors for  to  the price of an Ipad. BTW, Apple might use old Ipad 1 parts in a refurbished Ipad 2.	1	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I tried to hook the IPAD up to my wireless network. It failed 4 times. I checked the password and tried again. It failed another 4 times. I had a friend use his smartphone (not an IPhone) to connect to my wireless network and within a minute he was in. So the only conclusion is that apple does not deal well with difficult passwords. This is another reason why apple is all flash and no substance. I will buy an Android tablet.	1	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I was surprised to see that my iPad2 was defect. However the box was nicely sealed and the item looked brand new. So I mailed in a complaint to the Amazon retail store that sold me the product. I got a fast response saying that I should contact Apple, because it's a factory defect. So I replied on the mail by saying, Why? I purchased from you, so you should handle this case with your supplier (which in this case is Apple). But that did not help much, I really needed to contact Apple online store to solve this problem. So I did! To make a long story short, 3 weeks later and I finally have a new iPad2. Not from the Amazon online store, but directly from Apple. My sugestion is. Don't buy this item from this Amazon store, since there is no benifit in buying from them!	1	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I bought this ipad for my husband. It arrived on time and intact. However, there were no instructions for use. After communication with the vendor, we learned it is necessary to ""activate"" the ipad by plugging it in to an internet-connected computer with subsequent connection to itunes. However, even after ""activation"" there are still no instructions as to how to set basic things up such as email. My husband ended up taking it in to his tech people to set up basic needs, and this has taken a large amount of time and work (and still is not complete over a month later with multiple people involved).

This is disappointing since the unit cost over $1,000. Surely, basic setup instructions should be included for an item of this value!!!

Perhaps buying an ipad from this vendor might be good for those of you already highly knowledgeable in how to set an ipad up. For the rest of you, do even consider buying here. Go to an Apple store or to another source that offers basic installation instructions and help. My iphone works great, but I bought it from an Apple store where all my questions were answered up front. I wish I had bought this ipad from the same store.

Bottom line: the hardware coming from this vendor is probably fine. There is no set up help or instruction,however, so avoid this vendor unless you already know what you need to do.

We cannot yet review the ipad itself since it is not yet set up after many weeks of trying."	1	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Do you like watching online media that comes from other media distributors and not just pay apple for everything you watch? Would you like to watch videos you already own on a mobile Device without hours of re-encoding to Apples proprietary format for each video you want to watch?

Well then don't buy Apple products because they have the same IRON Grip on every one. I own Apple products (luckily I didn't have to buy them all my job did) and I've been sorely disappointed with every one. Apple products have not Flash support, no Java support, and no support for almost any video formats that are not Apple proprietary.

If you want a mobile pad that plays almost any video I would suggest the Asus Eee pad both support flash, and both support Java, so that means online streaming sites work, and online flash games work. (two things Apple don't want you to be able to use so you have to get videos and games from them.)

Now I can't speak for the Galaxy (though I've heard good things) but the Asus Eee pad is great for video. To watch video on the Asus Eee pad you plug in the pad, it comes up as a drive, you drag your video files to the Asus pad, and then you watch them without having to re-encode. This pad has played every video file I've tried. Be smart get almost anything other than an Ipad, you'll be happier not being told what you can do, and what to buy, that is ALMOST as good as what YOU actually want to do with a product YOU spent money for.

And remember don't drink the Apple Kool-aid and don't listen to the brainwashed hype of the Apple sheep who tell you to stay in the heard."	1	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I spent $900 on my asus laptop over a year ago and it can play video games equivalent to a PS3 or xbox360.  i can connect to my TV with an HDMI port, which are built into every single new HD TV for PC users.  Obviously ipads don't have HDMI ports because apple wants you to spend hundreds of dollars to hook ipads up to your TV.  They know you are stupid and will spend money on anything.  if you have this device you probably know nothing about computers. 1 GHZ processor?  really? my $900 laptop has 3.6 ghz processing speed.  64 gb memory? really? my laptop has 600 gb memory.  the ipad is still missing many notable features and if you buy this you will have to spend money money money! if you have no problem giving away your money to a scamming company then buy this.  otherwise, buy anything else.	1	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"If you already have a number of Apps and plan on buying more consider something else? Any purchases you make at the Apple Store are forever linked to your ID and password used at the time of purchase.
So if you buy a new system and/or want to change your e-mail address and passwords you will still have to use the old addresses and passwords in order to maintain or upgrade your Apps. Some of my Apps were
free, others were 99 cents and some over $45.00. Apple would not care. You would have to enter all the old e-mail addresses and passwords separately. After nearly 4 hours on the phone Apple suggested that I
could buy the same Apps again?

B0013FRNKG	"After suffering with the iPad for several month, I finally got a real tablet - the Acer A500 Android tablet. The iPad is primitive and awkward in comparison. Major failings of the iPad.

- Requires tether to a PC. Seriously, just like its 1999.
- Very slow
- Awkward web browser. Not even any tabs.
- ""multitasking"" only in marketing. It doesn't actually work
- Requires daily reboot to update apps, and prevent slowdowns (very little memory)
- Really just a big ipod touch with bigger apps
- 4:3 prevents watching HD movies in HD
- Frequent app crashes
- Poor wifi - slow and frequent loss of connection

Yandex maps (similar to Google Earth maps) are wonderful to help navigate in cities such as the one I am going to visit---Chernevitsi (AKA - Chernowitz). Only after I bought the system, I learned that I cannot use these 3D maps because Ipad does not support Adobe Flash. I pleaded with store representatives to give me a contact at Apple to see if there was any way aorund this. The staff say that there is no one else that I can speak to and that technical support will not be able to help. I even asked if there was someone perhaps in Russia who deals with Ipads who I could speak to. Apple reps essentially say ""sorry Charlie"" with a smile...""we are great and everything else is inferior"". Well be ware...I really think Apple is a big overpriced marketing gimmick."	1	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"I want to be perfectly clear ... I Do Not Own an Apple iPad2 or iPad1. I was close, oh so close to hitting the ""buy"" button then decided to shop around a wee-bit given the expense of the tablet.  Within a day or two the announcements concerning a few of Apple's hottest products .. iPad 2 & iPhone, we all know what those concerns are hit the media circuits.  I can't speak for you but, I most certainly don't want my every waking moment tracked - especially as deviously as Apple has set out to do. Apple didn't ask permission, didn't bother putting it in the ""fine"" print and when caught red-handed wouldn't even address. I have a million questions of my own i.e., whose idea was this, is Apple being paid by ""?"", is he government involved - what? It's out of control .. Everthing! I like my toys as much as the next guy but will trash them if this I Spy chit continues.  Needless to say I am not in the market for an iPad in the near furture.  My opinion, not a review granted - had I already purchased the iPad it would have been longer, louder and most likely censored!"	1	electronics
B0013FRNKG	In my opinion purchasing this product is nothing but wasting the money especially for those who want to use it for the Internet. In fact, this product and its ancestors are completely disappointing in order to use the Internet due to the lack of abilities in installing a variety of softwares such as adobe flash player. According to a number of restrictions by apple, anyone has to use just what has been installed on this device and so its usage is absoloutely rigid. For instance, you are unable to watch showtimes on IMDB because of its weakness to install flash player. I don't like a company with business purposes enforce me to use just something particular even if its products are so attractive. Also, its transferring data, as a wifi device, is entirely disappointing since such products are new and their technologies haven't been improved as good as you might expect. Remember if you are fan of spending money for gaming go ahead and buy it because this device has been planned for gaming. While you are using free games on this device, some adds appears on the screen and will not let you to enjoy free games.  All in all, this product is nothing but an amendment of iPhone.	1	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I bought an IPAD 2 64 gig 3g Verizon model the first week it came out. I bought it online. I received it 3 1/2 weeks later from china. It was amazing for the first 20 hours. The apps were so unbelievable. I have a touch, and it is so much better. On the second day, it started trying to shut down. The battery was at 80%. I tried shutting it off and could not. I called apple. I bought the extra care plan for 90 dollars so they are going to help me. Right? Wrong. The first representative we talked to had us restore it to the factory settings. It took 1 hour to download the 660 mg file. We then restored it to the factory settings. It started working perfectly. We were so happy. The problem was solved! I watched videos and played with it for hours. I ran the battery down and plugged it in overnight to charge. The next morning the problem was back in spades. It then started doing new things like flashing on and off. I went on the website and asked a specialist to call me again. She put me on hold. She was gone for a little while. When she came back, she said that I needed to mail it back to them to REPAIR it. I said What? I have the apple care plan and was told that you would send me a replacement. I have not even had this thing 2 days. She said that the other representative lied to me, and that she could not lie to me. I have 2 options. I can take it to the Apple Store (nearest one 165 miles away) or I can mail it and have it repaired and they will send the same one back to me. She made me an appointment at the store. I am driving the 165 miles to take it back. The second representative (a supervisor) told me that they would send me a replacement if I gave them a credit card and let them charge another 900 dollars for it. When they received the old one back, they would charge it back to me.

I have had a kindle for years. The day I saw it on the Oprah show was the day I fell in love with it. I bought one the same day. The first kindle i received was great except the internet would not work. I called Amazon and they shipped me out a kindle the SAME DAY! I got it a couple of days later and loved it. It worked perfectly. I upgraded to a DX and have never had a problem.

If you want to see a video of what it is doing, you can go to you tube and watch it. My username is caulret. I love Amazon and their amazing customer service!

Edited 4-16-11
I took it back to the Apple store. The people at the Plano Apple store were awesome. They did not want to give me my money back, but we negotiated with them and they ended up putting it back on our credit card with some creative measures. A more timid person would have had to take an apple gift card. This was all they said that they could do at first, but I held my ground.  I might buy this product again at a local Best Buy when they come available. If I decide to do that, I will edit this review. This was my true experience, and I wanted to share it."	1	electronics
