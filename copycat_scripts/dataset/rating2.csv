B0013FRNKG	Took to long for shipment	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"The iPad came in what appeared to be great shape. Recently, the iPad has been freezing/locking up and the volume button has a mind of it's own. It will turn the volume down and up and the ""volume"" display won't leave the screen. I don't appreciate the fact that I can't contact the seller for them to fix this issue. I was given a support chat box, which does not help. I would like to see the seller actually contact me to correct this issue on the laptop. I understand this was re-furbished, but not hardly lasting a month (Christmas present) is ridiculous!!"	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The ipad is extremely slow for a 32 gb (my old 16 gb at full capactity was faster).  There seems to be a fault with the control button which is very unresponsive and when the screen goes off, it takes a while for it to come back on.  May return the product when I return to the US	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I was so happy to get my IPAD. However, I will be returning the IPad today. The software is outdated and the home bottom is broken. I know that it's used but the Home button is KEY component of the IPad. Next time, please mention that in the description.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Lasted about 6 months. I am wondering if it was a used one sold as new??	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Locked up not long after purchase. Lost all my info. and pictures. Evidently this happens quite often!	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I have been extremely disappointed with this product.  I had saved for a long time to be able to afford an ipad, and was so excited.  At the very first, while I was still learning how to use it, I was pleased with it.  However, after having it for just over a month, it would only work if I kept it plugged in.  I would uplug it, it would say battery was 100% charged and less than 5 minutes later it was dead and had to be re-charged.  Now it won't even come on at all, and it has come loose on the side.  Very disappointed that I wasted all that money on such an inferior product/  I won't be purchasing any more Apple products.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Incredibly slow machine. Have tried numerous things, it just takes the small bus to school.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Slow wifi -- latest version it can be updated to is 9.x.

I definitely recommend getting an iPad air 2 for about the same price with better specs."	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Very slow. Not sure if its the IPAD or etc. but all of our other devices work fine and fast.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Bought this 10"" ipad for my mom for Christmas and she used it constantly since then, to watch Netflix and speak on messenger with my sister living abroad and view facebook.....that's it. Last night the screen turned black and white.  Googling the problem said to go to general / accessiblity / turn grayscale off (it wasn't on) - same selections turn color invert off (it wasn't on)......... The amazon fire 7"" I bought her Christmas 2015 is still going strong with no problems at all"	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I was very disappointed. t looked like  had been e	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	It works. It doesn't have any scratches. The touchscreen is delayed. You will have to type and then it will show up delayed. The worst and most annoying thing is that it keeps shutting off by itself for no reason. Aso when you press the button it takes pictures (when it shouldn't). I would not highly  recommend this product.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Really looks good but no instructions as how to use it. Slide to set-up works only if you are a computer genius! Not very happy with the product. I thought you coud could ""talk to text""! Have to take it to AT&T store. Maybe they can help!
After ""set-up"" worked really good FOR 6 WEEKS. Now it will only text. No phone calls. Took it to AT&T ""set-up"" was ok. ""Something"" wrong with the I-pad & they did not work on them. Thank goodness I purchased it thru AMAZON, they are great. I'm returning the Ipad & Amazon is giving me a full refund. Don't know what to do with the $20.00 cover I purchased for it,"	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	iPad seems to work good but the charger that came with it will not work and it was dirty like it was used .	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I ordered two of these at the same time. I am disappointed in the lack of consistency in the quality of the refurbishment. Several scratches on the screen and the back of one, and they were not consistent in their set-up with regards to iOS versions and on screen appearance. I would expect that ordering two of the exact same iPads from the same company would equate to a standard product that would not require so much of my time in making them ""equal"", but that was not the case. One is clearly more superior than the other."	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	It came with the wrong charging cord!	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Very slow and laggy on iOS 9. Apps take a while to open and the whole UI was slow and laggy. Decided to sell it and got a 3rd gen ipad mini instead. I'll take a smaller, faster ipad over a large and slow ipad any day.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Worked for several days, then it died, unable to turn  back on, charged for several days, and still not able to turn back on.
Did the soft and hard reboot, still not working.  Shipped back to Amazon, for a refund."	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Very slow , the same description iPad after a year is on Amazon for $124  and I have payed $338 and the discription says it is new! My grandson complaints that it is slow and want to know if Amazon can trade in for a new one.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Would you like a device to cruise Facebook, play some mobile games, or check email? Don't get this one.
This iPad is so laughably bad that you'd be better off doing any of those things on your mobile than this thing. Go ahead, cruise Facebook as long as you can before it crashes. Get lucky and find some way the app won't crash? Don't worry, if you find something you want to click on--a video, an article, or even a post you simply want to read all of--this device will find a way to crash it.
You may be thinking: ""well, maybe it's the app and not the device."" Wrong. Open the settings app and watch it crash; open Netflix and watch it crash; hell, open a jigsaw puzzle app...and watch it crash. They all crash.
But worry not! Apple has just the fix. You will only need to update the OS software 3 times per week. None of which will fix any of the app issues, but will allow Apple to say you agreed to mandatory arbitration 3 times a week for years.
Besides all the app problems, this thing is stupidly slow. This is now an older model, but having been gifted it when it was new, I'll tell you it was always like this. I like to use a four-digit pass code for my iPad. Sometimes, this device will take damn near 30 seconds to load the numbers I hit and unlock the device, only to lag and not allow me to scroll between screens.
Want to turn the screen to landscape view? Sorry, you'll have to shake it to recognize the change, making you look like you're having a seizure in the meantime. Don't want the screen to rotate because you're in the middle of something? Sorry, only when you don't want it to rotate will the slightest direction change make the screen rotate.
I give 2 stars only because sometimes, when the device isn't being a bigger pain-in-the-rear than Donald Trump, it can be a joy to use. But remember, turn off all the things that make this device worth having; background app refresh for things like email, high-quality videos because the device slows down, way down, and social media apps because reasons.
I would recommend an old roadkill shovel over this device. Suck it Apple fan boys."	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	works well very happy	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Terrible condition. Broken glass. Ugly personal engraving on back. Basically not worth what I paid.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The charger was not the original.  The place on the ipad where you plug the charger into was broke and cracked!  I am not happy!!!	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The home button does not work. This Ipad was refurbished with a brand new screen, however, the sensor for the home button was not fixed. I would have liked to known that the Ipad was not fully functional before I purchased it.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Hate it! Gave it away, and purchased  a Samsung Galaxy Tab3, and I love it!	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	item was not as described -	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This did not come with Apple packaging, no charger and no instructions.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The order came in and it has no charger i paid in full so i was expectant the full package.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The home button stopped working about a week after it was still able to be returned.  I ended up paying for repairs, and I could have purchased a new iPad for the total of the original purchase and repairs.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	purchased in Nov 2015. of course loaded with Google apps. I only added three apps. it is constantly updating google then the battery is low. last time I charged ipad would not turn on. not worth the money. Huge disappointment.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	slow and blurry	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"A ""no sim card"" message pops up ever so often making it miserable to use."	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The battery didn't even make it 6 months before it stopped holding a charge.  It is very difficult to replace without destroying the Ipad.  Also, the camera is of poor resolution and pixels show up.  I won't every buy this product again.  I would save myself the headache and money and buy something newer.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Received it today and the IPAD received has major dings in one corner, which indicates the unit was dropped. Not happy as this was supposed to be in good or very good condition.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I got this I pad as a gift for a loved one for Christmas who lives several hundred miles away. I contacted the seller about issues I was having with activation who initially made it seem like it was my fault. I grew aggravated with them after he gave me countless links unrelated to the problem. I would advise others looking to purchase an iPad from this seller to look elsewhere.  The price, while seemingly affordable, is not worth the hassle that you may have to deal with to set up the I pad. I am not the type of person to write reviews but this was absolutely ridiculous. Please look elsewhere when buying an IPad. It will be worth it.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"We received the incorrect iPad, we had order the WiFi capable only and received an iPad the requires a sim card. We have been trying to log into the iPad it was a gift for my mom and it is proving to be difficult, since any time we have tried to log into her apple ID it takes so long to load that it never actually logs in and simply states ""Verification Failed."" This is frustrating and displeasing, I just wanted a new iPad for my mom."	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Have to say I was disappointed with this refurbished iPad. The performance of the iPad itself is very slow and a software update did not help. Also the fruit fly that was living in the screen when we unboxed it has remained in the area behind the screen. Would I buy a used iPad again off amazon? Not likely.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	No paperwork at all! No instructions no warranty, just the iPad and a charger in a plain white box.  Where is the paperwork?	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	bought for my 3 yr old work good for 6-7 months don't work now stop working on her won't  take charge or come on we used it for story time so it was not beat around or anything so a little pissed off  I say junk	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"It works wonderfully.

UPDATE:  Yesterday, 02 November 2015, four and half weeks after I received it, the screen quit working.  I spent a long time today talking with Apple support, and the conclusion is that I need to send the iPad in for repair.  The cost for repair through Apple is $249.00.

UPDATE:  On 04 November 2015, I got it repaired at iMechanic for $40.00."	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Have owned 2 ipads and both developed cracks.  Also Safari crashes a lot.  Gives alerts like ""There was a problem with this page so it was reloaded"".  The Safari browser is crap.  The Atomic web browser is much much better."	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This device will not stay connected to wifi. Must continually go back to settings and reset. Missed return date because I thought problem was with router .Very annoying.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I have had an iPad 2 through work.  I wanted one for at home.  The touch pad responds poorly and it is slow as molasses.  Used the same connection for both.  I want to throw it across the room!	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Worked fine for a few months and it was in good condition externally. Now the battery has died completely (won't charge at all) and we have stopped using it.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Once upon a time if a product was obsolete it was not offered for sale.  Now it seems that you cannot tell, unless you are very up to date on technology, whether or not the product you buy is any better than one you already have.  It would be helpful if, in the product write-up, a person was told what difference there is in the multitude of Ipads that are offered for sale. I now have a product that has no more apps that I could get before.  I have been very happy with most of the products I buy at Amazon but this has been a disappointment.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	When we received this product and gave it to our employee it was wonderful, however he came back the next day and said it doesn't work.  We are trying to return it and purchase another one.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Didnt have sd card slot or usb slot..not very flexible or adaptable	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I'm a little pissed it's starting to not charge at all, and I've had it less than three months!	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	ipad was never cleared out by original owner so I havenot been able to get into it after weeks of cnversations with apple.  I will be returning if this problem cannot be fixed	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	It was a preowned very sloe	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The camera takes lousy, grainy photos.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	It didn't meet the expectations I had hoped for, it stopped functioning properly 3 weeks after I got it	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Charger does not work properly. IPad connector to charger cablr damaged.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Sent this to my mother-in-law and portions of the screen stopped responding.  She had to rotate to landscape to be able to type, and eventually had to avoid the right quarter (as seen in portrait view) of the touch screen no matter what, which meant rotating very often to touch a responsive region.  She stopped trying to play words with friends on it and finally let us know about the problem and we replaced it.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Touch screen doesn't work well. Will have to replace	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I pad came with wrong charger but other than that was ok	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This product arrived to me with the wrong charger and the battery was dead so I was unable to use.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The overall look was good but having difficulty with the volume button not working properly, turning the ipad off is difficult aswell. The zoom keeps coming on hard to set it back.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The pad works really sllllllllllow	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Fixed!	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The iPad is not holding  battery charge, I use it for a very small business retail it gets use once per hour for sales. It has to stay pluged in. The seller didn't not mention this issue. also it arrived with the  previous owners information. That problem was corrected when I contacted the seller. I need to address the battery issue I have spent to much time loading retail information it is allot of work I very disappointed.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I forgot how fast technology rolls through these days.  Everything is going at such a rate it is hard to keep up.  I'll be up front and say that I am not a huge Apple fan to begin with.  My husband had wanted to try out iPad.  I thought getting a iPad 2 would be enough but the technology isn't up to par.  Because it is an older version it doesn't have the capacity to hold some of the games we would play on the phone or other tablets.  It pretty much serves well for emails, or watching Netflix.

That is not to say the newer version of this product wouldn't be amazing.  I think for future reference if I were to purchase an apple product or any future technology purchases it would be a wise idea to get the more up to date technology.  I miss the simplicity of how stuff used to be but that is how it goes."	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Rear Camera wouldn't work no matter how many times we reset, restored, etc.  Returning it.  Very disappointed.  Loved our first generation iPad but wanted to be able to use Facetime and take pictures and videos with this one.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	they are cheat on me. its not apple ipad 2 that is apple ipad 1.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Junk. This was purchased as a refurbished item and it DOES NOT WORK. I can't have it on/use it more than 2-3 minutes without it giving me a temperature warning (though it is not warm to the touch). It worked fine the first night, and hasn't worked right since. I've contacted the seller, and gotten no reply. Onto the A-Z guarantee!	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Worst pick , i am not returning this immediately.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	its an christmas gift.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The touch screen has bad spots. It won't registered that I am touching it. Sometime when I type it registers the number twice.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	There were scuffs and marks but product works ok.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Didn't not have new screen like post	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	has problems powering up	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	lots of scratches	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I returned it as it wouldn't take a charge.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I did not like much as there is no clarity
When taking the pictures . The camera quality is very poor in the piece that was delivered when compared to the normal I pad quality ."	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	It was working fine initially but the screen colors started to get messed up and had to return.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	old software was not able to update to new platform returned to seller	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	had some things wrong with the screen. The touch sensor was going out on it. Unable to get hold of the seller	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	was defective ... would lock up repeatedly	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I didn't realize it used a data card that was not Verizon. Had I known it did not have a Verizon data card, I would not have purchased it.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I was very exited to receive the Ipad it was a gift for mother but when we opened it
The ipad was like smashed in the corners; I wanted to returned but she wanted to try it
So she end up keep in it. She got a big sturdy cover. But still I am no content."	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The ipad I received had a little scratch on the screen as it was stated when I purchased it, but as I started to use the iPad a week or two later the screen started to go out until the Apple sign appeared on the screen and then the screen shuts off. I thought at first it was just rebooting itself but now it is happening more often and now I have lines on the screen, and it won't shut off even if I hit the start button or power button. I just have lines going toward the top of the screen please contact me to rectify this matter.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Although the ipad 2 was functional I could not use it beyond 6 feet from my wireless network.  My other ipad does receive the signal  and in addition my other ipad also gives me other networks in my local area. Therefore I had to return it. Had it worked properly, I would have kept it.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Looks pretty and functions for my intended use (reading music), but completely useless as a replacement laptop.  The apps are not designed to work with an external keyboard (so you'd still have to scroll with the touchscreen instead of page up/down on the external keyboard), and about 75% of the time, bluetooth sync just locks up to the point that I have to hard reboot it (and even then, it usually doesn't work).  I wish I had bought an Android tablet.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This tablet may have pretty good graphics but there are a lot of faults with it to. Like both cameras really aren't that good really Apple a $400 tablet with only 0.7 mp front and back camera. Not to mention there's no micro sad card slot wich i know none of apples devices have but still they should add it in to them a lot of people wind up needing more space. And why was Siri not added in it was out before this tablet was and it was put in the iPhone 4. People who actually read this review before you buy it ur better off getting a galaxy tab 3 lite it's a lot cheaper then this. its graphics are equal if not better and it has a 2mp camera a whole lot better than this one it alson has a micro sd card slot up to 32 gigs of memory.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The retailer did not disclose that this was second-hand or refurbished. I round out when I took it to the Apple store.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	the IPad does  not  hold its charge.  I can charge it to 100% and by evening it could be all used up even when I don't do anything on the IPad.  that is why I am returning it.  I have another order in to take its place that I just ordered.  I would like to put the refund toward the new IPad.  Hopefully I can return this with out any problems.  Thank you	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The newer models have a  nicer screen and  the touch keyboard on this model is a little hard to  deal with.  There are some letters that require a harder touch	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Its had more scratches than it said i would not recommend it to any body that wants a perfect ipad	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The tablet was not working correctly. It would suddenly go back to the home screen. Also the seller did not check that the storage account was cancelled from the previous owner.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Because when I upgraded the IOS , the wifi just got very weak that  i cant connect when I am over 5 feet away from my D Link router.

And I just bought a refurbished model  and I will most likely donate this to my brother. I have a feeling that Apple is rendering their older hardware useless so we buy the  new model."	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I am sorry that I got this IPad. I wished I would have gotten an android. This IPad doesn't do what I expect of it. Also it is nothing like my LapTop. There was no directions to this stupid thing and that is discouraging. I wished I would also got something that you can insert a scan disk card. I wouldn't recommend it unless you like Apple.and know how to operate it.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	iPad virtual keyboard touch is very inaccurate and frustrating.  The Kingston keyboard attached has yet to work and it came without a cable to charge the keyboard so I contacted the seller to make good on this and send me the cable to recharge the keyboard--if not I can't cope with the frustrating inaccuracy of the virtual keyboard.  It's in the seller's hand to make good on this now.  Will update when the seller has had time to respond.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Not what I expected as I did not realize that it did not have siri and should have ordered Retina display model.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	It is much harder to learn than I was led to believe and difficult to schudule appt times for $;100 tutoring.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	the iPad itself is it in good shape but it is so slow I don't know what's wrong with It all the other electronics in the house are lightning-fast including my daughters iPad	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	this was listed as a new ipad, it was not, it was open with no seal on the box or over the face of the ipad	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"The price of this was a little higher that I could have paid for it at a retail store so I was abit disapointed. The machine functions as designed and all is well however; I will shop around a bit closer next time

Thank you for allowing me to provide input"	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"The product is fine with one exception.  You're pretty much stuck with the lousy Safari browser on this.  It is totally worthless as far as I'm concerned.  You can't import existing bookmarks without going through a big long scenario to do it.

As far as the shipping is concerned, I have other concerns and the fact I will no longer waste my time paying Amazon for a prime account.  When I ordered the iPad it said on the screen ""if you order in the next 2 hours and 22 minutes"" receive it by Monday 12/30/13.  This never happened.  A word of warning to anyone buying from this Shopvius company.  They are worthless when it comes to shipping your product on time.

With the exception of piece of trash Safari and the shipping the product is fine."	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The I-Pad has been good, but when we went into the Apple store for technical help, we learned that Amazon has not register the I-Pad yet, therefore our warranty expires in July 2013, the date of manufacture, rather than November, 2013, the date of purchase. If this would have been purchased through Apple, the registration of the device would have occurred immediately.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The item was listed as being a generation 2 Ipad.  Checked with Apple and was told that it is a Generation 3.  Don't you know what products you sell.  Made an appointment with the Apple Store to examine the ipad to determine if it has been used.  Will respond when I get the results from Apple.  Still like the little product though.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"My lovely and kind daughters bought me the ipad2 as a birthday present October 2012. In brief you can love 50% of what the product has to offer and you can hate the other 50%.

Strengths: excellent video quality and simplicity ? Docs to Go works fairly well, but not without glitches particularly if your desktop crashes and has to be reloaded. No way to sync the existing ""good files"" That,is supposed to be ""apple easy"" ?

Book reader capability works pretty well. I can listen to mp3 audios or lectures and sermons. But it misses a continue listening where I left off feature. Battery life is decent.

Conns: Absolute torture for the over 50 years old crowd. NO usb; TO MAKE ANYTHING WORK OR BE USABLE YOU HAVE TO purchase Apple apps on apple's terms.

To get initial questions answered I drove 100 miles to the nearest Apple store in Augusta, Georgia on three separate occasions and once there, essentially had to listen to the ""prepared class"" rather than learn how to make the ipad2 immediately productive.

If you want to the ipad2 to do anything productive, you have to install ""apps"". Pay us and pay us and pay us. Many of the ""free"" ipad apps are very buggy. You are left to read user's reviews and ""try"" out the app which can make you waste 2 hrs of your time because it is not a properly written app and ""hangs"" or crashes. Then you have to ""jump through hoops to get it off Itunes or it will remain on your ipad2. If you have to uninstall it, you waste more time.

As I said 50% of it is ""slick"" and 50% of it needed three years to get the biggest ""bugs"" out of it.

Safari browser is a difficult and cumbersom adjustment for Windows users. The E-Mail program requires you to relearn EVERYTHING Apple's way. Sound will not automatically play in many or most videos because they are tied to quick time. So now you are forced to buy other apps which may or may not play the video you just stumbled across.

APPLE ITUNES IS AN ABSOLUTE JOKE. IT IS WRITTEN FOR YOU TO BUY STUFF FROM THEM PERIOD ! The first page that pops up is begging you to buy their songs or videos.

Simply tranferring existing mp3's to the ipad 2 requires you to jump through hoops and waste an unbelievable amount of time.

Documents to Go works fairly well unless your desktop crashes and you have to reload your desktop. Then, you have no way of simply ""syncing"" the existing files on the ipad2 to a new desktop. An absolute pain in the xxs and waste of time!

There is NO seemless way to transfer existing password programs to take over in Safari. You have to buy the apple offerred program and I DID NOT find it easy to use.

Video HAH ! Video plays beautifully BUT ONLY ON THE IPAD. Try and transfer the video elsewhere and you face aggravation. I downloaded the latest quick time to my computer and the download video file (through the cable) WOULD NOT PLAY.

As I said aggravation. Would I buy one again or recommend the ipad2 ? No. There are cheaper alternatives out there that cost less money. For the money spent here I could purchase a 14 or 15 inch windows laptop computer.

Born in 1947"	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I mainly use my lap top for playing games and reading emails but wanted something smaller and lighter so tried the ipad.  It is smaller and lighter but I found I could not play most of my games as it does not support Adobe. So I traded it to my daughter and she loves it.  So I guess in the end it worked out okay but it just wasn't for me.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I've had my iPad 2 for a while now and I used to love it. It had a very crisp and unique look, functioned smoothly, and took care of all my entertainment needs. Then I turn it on one day and see I have an update. iOS 7...

Since the update I feel robbed and cheated. Even the simplest of functions(like typing in a 4 digit password) have a lag/delay. The ""new and improved"" graphic design is a total disaster. It looks like a 5 year old was asked to replicate the look of a windows tablet.

Would you like to watch a movie or tv show on your iPad with iOS 7? If you said yes then you'd better grab a pair of oven mitts to hold it with. That's right-now the back gets scalding hot after 30 minutes using it.

Finally we get to the battery life. I spent around 10 minutes writing this review and in that time the battery has gone from 91% down to 83%. Before the update a single charge would last almost an entire week of medium/light use.

My mother has the same issues with her iPad so it's not that mine is faulty or defective. I want to stress that my problems have been more with the update to iOS 7 than with the iPad itself. If these issues are resolved then I will edit my review and my rating, but as of right now I can't recommend this product to anybody."	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	they shouldnt have even bothered with the resolution on this. if you have average vision or better, this won't look very sharp compared to most other tablets. resolution is too low for a screen this size. and another thing: the icons are spaced out too far. other than that, it works as youd expect.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I was very excited when i got this, but as it turns out, something was wrong with the screen and the typing mechanism was weird and not very fast.... almost like the brain of the iPad wasn't working correctly. It was a birthday present for my mom and I ended up having to spend ANOTHER $400 + to buy her a new one because I felt so bad that this one didn't work.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I do not like this item, but it had nothing to do with the seller. I should have done more research because this item is not as good for digital painting as it had claimed to be. Shipper good...my research not so good.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The IPad was supposed to be new but I could not get apple protection because it was over a year old.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Dear dealer. there is a crevice between the screen and the back cover. Therefore, ash will get in the pad.....	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Had this thing for a couple weeks now and it's essentially a glorified gameboy.

The camera is total garbage- I mean my 1995 webcam was higher resolution. The speaker is on the rear of the ipad (why?!) making the poor audio quality and volume even worse. I have sensitive eyes and the brightness does not go nearly low enough to use comfortably in a dark room at night. The volume buttons don't adjust to when the ipad is rotated so I am constantly changing it in the wrong direction. The web access is dodgy even though my router is in my room and there's no signal issue. iOS is very lacking, notifications are tedious to turn off, ad block doesn't do bleep...

Battery life is pretty much the only thing decent about this. Screen resolution is just OK. I honestly think this is worth about $50-100 at most. $400 can buy a much more versatile and powerful netbook."	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	14 months after purchase (this means 1 year warranty is not in effect) my front camera will not work.  When I looked this up online it seems like a common problem.  Contacted Apple and a replacement will cost $249.  Not happy about this but I still love my iPad2.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Seller was truthful about the fact that the screen was free of damage, however, he/she neglected to mention that there were major cracks and chips on the edge of the ipad. Item worked as intended however, I felt the price should've been lower for the amount of cosmetic damage to this item.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I ordered a NEW I Pad Generation 2 White.  It did say that on  the wrapping on the outside of the backage.  When I removed the wrapping my husband noticed that the bar code on the box said that it was a RFB (refurbished) I Pad Generation 2 black.  To my disappointment that is what it was.  I returned it and ordered straight from the Apple web site.  It was cheaper as well.  Now I wonder if ALL the things I ordered from Amazon throughout the years are really the brand and quality that I ordered.  I think that they should check on their companies that they contract are on the upright.  I may think twice now.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I have had an iPad2 for roughly a year.  In that time, I have had to take it in for repairs twice.  The first time was when it was upgrading the OS software and simply stopped halfway through the process.  I plugged it in since I did not want it to die from lack of battery power.  Three days later, it was still at the same place in the download.  That was the first trip to the repair shop.  A week or two later, it is back and working great.  Now, about a month ago, it was at about 60% power so I plugged it in for the night.  That was the last I saw any life in the thing.  Since I do not have the receipt (it was a gift) and too much time has passed (even though much of the time was not necessarily in my possession), repairs are going to cost a bucket load.  The while that I had the iPad2 was pretty fun, but Heaven knows when I will see it again, and I believe that the information recorded on it will be gone.  So, short story, my experience is a two-star experience with Apple.	2	electronics

B0013FRNKG	As far as tablets go the iPad is alright, works just fine. There were a few things about it that I didn't like but they really didn't matter to me (ex: camera, keyboard, etc). But the main problem I had was the limitations. For instance say someone wants to play a facebook game or something similar, cannot play it. You can play games found on the AppStore, but not your favorite online game. All in all it is a decent table, I don't recommend this for people wanting something as their main computer, this computer has too many limitations. For what it is Apple needs to lower pricing, it's not worth the price.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I ordered this product,totally knowing what ""refurbished"" means, i have a refurbished laptop and never had problems with it!!!never.

B0013FRNKG	"After having both for as long as I've had them, I cannot in good conscience recommend this product to anyone that values roughly $450 or more.

I originally thought the iPad was as good as tablets got, but it simply is no longer the fact anymore. After borrowing friends Android tablets, I realised the iPad was utter garbage.

Reasons:
-email client constantly freezing up
-the entire tablet constantly hanging
-Safari, the worst web browser EVER created
-lack of truely useful apps that are fully integrated with either Macs or Windows based PC's
-lack of USB, SD, or any peripheral besides completely proprietary Apple devices
-iTunes
-inability to reliably surf 70% of the internet
-has Bluetooth, but won't connect to non-Apple Bluetooth devices
-the apps for just straight suck, i.e. YouTube and Apple Maps
-now that my iPad 1 is over a year old it doesn't even want to turn on about a 4th of the time, so planned obsolesence makes this list

Unless you have money to burn, or just want your kids to have a neat playtoy because the games are at least enjoyable like Cut The Rope, I recommend getting the Samsung tablet. It does everything the iPad does, but does it faster and more reliably, more all together, and is far easier to integrate with other systems"	2	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"This is my 2nd Apple product I've ever owned.  The first one being the littlest Ipod from years ago.  I'm pretty impressed by it, along with my lil daughter, when she saw it being charged, she screamed ""Ipad!!!""  lol.  The only thing that bummed me out was when it came with no battery life at all.  I had to charge it while getting the Ipad2 all set up, needless to say, it was stuck to the charger for couple of hours, while I downloaded free apps. I did notice it immediately registered Verizon, but I have AT&T wireless internet at home and this was meant to be just Wifi only.  And not for long, it started asking if I want to add more data now or later before I can proceed with browsing.  That was an easy fix and I was able to modify it to just Wifi only. It then asked for IOS6 update while in the midst of downloading apps.  And after that, it was just smooth sailing and I made sure to enable some restrictions so my 4 yr old won't be buying any in-apps accidentally.  Read too much horror stories on that.  I did tell her to never click on the word ""buy"" because that would mean, it will take money away from Mommy!  LOL  Overall, quite happy with my big purchase.  I know this ain't the newest Ipad model but to me, it's good enough!
And I am as pleased with the case and the screen protector I bought here in Amazon.
UPDATE: 4/22/2015
I am so disappointed to share that our beloved Ipad died after 2 yrs and 4  months.  It was all great until around the time when it upgraded to the latest IOS and it seemed to deteriorate from there, it still worked as normal, just a few glitches here and there and so I downgraded to the previous IOS version which seemed better.  But just one day, my daughter reached for our Ipad and then it just went black for no reason, no warnings, whatsoever.  And then I tried so many times to ""restore/update"" and just won't go beyond the restoring firmware.  I got the Apply Genius people look at it and the guy said, it's just time to upgrade as these are meant to be upgraded every 2 yrs or so (I'm shocked!), especially after paying for more than $500 new, they can replace it with $249.  So now, I'm contemplating on just buying a Samsung Tab 4, and can only hope that it will last longer than this Ipad."	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"While reading these comments on my iPad 2, I'm wondering, why did I get an iPad 2 and why would anyone buy an iPad? I can't stand the way that Apple nickle and dimes you for everything. Almost every App on iTunes costs money, where as most Apps on Play are free. My wife's iPhone 4S was having problems the other day, so I called Apple Care. I was told that I needed to create an Apple Care account for $29.99, just so I could talk to a customer service rep!.......Are you freaking kidding me?! What kind of costumer service is that? Ok, here's your iPad, want to personalize it?..........Too bad! Want to hook it to your TV, without buying a $100 Apple TV module?.............Too Bad! Want to use a YouTube app?.........Too bad! Want to use Google maps?..........Too bad! Want to use your Gmail account without it being gliche?........Too bad! Want to use Google search engine, without it constantly saying, ""Invalid URL""?...........Too bad! Here's your iPad. Take it or leave it. You can't personalize it or do what you want, because we are Apple, the most powerfull cooperation in the world, and we know what you want way more than you do.

My next tablet or phone will NEVER be Apple,  but if all the people like being bent over and having it stuck in their pooper, by all means keep throwing your money at Apple. Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice; shame on me.

People keep comparing the hardware and software of current Android tablets vs. Apple iPads, but that isn't the issue. Apple tells you what you can and can't do with its devices. It's like buying a Ferrari and having it governed at 40 MPH. Why would anyone do this?"	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	every time I open the Ipad, I need to redo my Wi-Fi connections. and they shut off at will. I use the same Wi-Fi for my computer and it is on all the time. This is a terrible inconvenience.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The hardware is great, but the associated software is shoddy. I've been struggling with Apple's email client for months, resulting in lost email and hours of wasted time! For example, I've searched for email that I can even see in the Inbox, just as a test, and the software can't find it. I've reverted to web-based email. Apple ought to be ashamed. Further, the OS led me to expect to be able to enlarge views, but that only works sometimes. Finally, the touch screen's copy, select, and paste functions are incredibly  frustrating. If you are clicking on small text and want to cut and paste, it's sometimes impossible to select the correct spot, and I've wasted a total of hours trying to do this basic function. An alternative would be arrow keys in the software (on-screen) keyboard, but there are none! Great hardware is one thing, but if the user is constantly frustrated by the software, then the overall experience is terrible. I've also given up, even after downloading Google's app, trying to edit my Google docs. I was ready to sell my used iBook and just rely on my iPad, but I am often soooo relieved to be back to an easier to use interface, that I'm afraid I'll have to keep both. Ridiculous! Apple is going to lose customers once the word really gets out.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"This it a big disappointment.  After you spend $700 you then have to go out and buy third party books to figure out how to begin to use the thing.  Or spend boucoup bucks on Apple care so you can use the thing.
'll stick to Asus from here on out.  If you purchase their product from stores other than Best Buy, you can get two years free 24/7 tech support AND accidental damage protection included in the price of the product.  They don't advertise the second year except in their warranty registration paperwork, but those of us who've bought ASUS before know about it.

iPad is cute, but not worth the money.  Even with the maximum memory, I don't find it powerful enough to work on ancestry.com with it, and that's the primary reason we got it.

I'm not impressed with Apple products in general.  Their itunes is garbage.  My son has the top of the line imac (i7 version) and it's a pretty piece of useless sculpture.  Should have known better than to waste money on an ipad."	2	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"Okay, so I am sort of known for reviews that are true and up to the point. I'm not going to treat the iPad as some sort of godlike creation, I am going to give the most straight review I can: the iPad isn't that great.
Heres the things I will go into detail about: First of all,its got graphic capabilities that are about halfway to Playstation PSP and Nintendo DS, so its game's are pretty,but they aren't anything to get excited about.
Next up, its App market is great. But the problem with it...well, I'll get to that.
The hardware itself.. that's where i got a bone to pick.
It slipped out of my hands one day and it hit my tile floor,and the screen cracked. And the same thing happened to my friend: but his was in a protective case. These things are fragile, which makes me wonder why anyone would trust these things to a kid under 5.
Speaking of fragile,ive dropped the ipad on -carpet- before and the video output on the screen turned green and well.. broken. If you want to see this for yourself: Google ""iPad Green screen problem"".
Finally, I bet you are wondering: What about those apps I bought? My ipad still sounds usuable,so I still use them,right?
Well, yes,and no. The thing is when I dropped my iPad,I was -moving- it. I still use all my apps,but the only good ones i got from it were universal: So when I say i'm using them,I mean on my iPhone.
So,to bring it all back home: Its just an overpriced piece of technology that you probably will stop using after 6 months, give or take how much you have to pour into it to find uses for it."	2	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"After owning an iPad 2 for several months, I have to say that it's overhyped and I can't recommend it

Initially, it seemed wonderful. I had all these plans and apps to transition a lot of my daily tasks to it, such as news, reading, and notes. However, one by one, I stopped using the iPad for each different task because it's inferior to my other devices in each category. When I read news, I'm either already at my desk and computer already, or I just want to whip out my smartphone and read a quick article. In terms of note-taking, the software options for notes and document editing on the iPad are absolutely awful compared to full PC programs. Furthermore, don't expect to use the touch screen for any real amount of typing. Its auto-correct is very prone to messing you up without you noticing. The list goes on.

So sure, it's a multi-functional device, but it's basically the worst of all worlds. It was fun at first, but as soon as the novelty wore off, it just became a chore to use the iPad for anything compared to other methods. I eventually realized I was only using it at all to justify my ownership of it, rather than for practical reasons. At last, today, I found it collecting dust in my room and turned it on to discover that I hadn't used it at all in a month.

Yes, it is a good looking, small, lightweight device. Yes, it has some useful applications. But for me, your average office worker and college student, is it practical or useful? No."	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I was in the process of purchasing 26 iPad 2s over a period of 3 months for my employer when Apple switched to the new model and stopped selling the iPad 2 32GB that I need.

When received I was disappointed to find that they were Certified Refurbished.  When I tried to return, the seller started an email argument over whether I should have realized the units were not factory new, then said I should try them out before returning, finally said that if I would return them, he would refund upon receipt.  No offer of a label, etc. Afraid if I sent them back I would never see my money. Felt like a bad ebay transaction, not the guaranteed, no-hassle returns that Amazon advertises.  I ended up keeping the units.  Hoping I don't get fired when they fail to perform.  They're ok so far."	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Tablets are toys. Last year, I dropped cable and considered either buying a Mac Mini or iPad 2 w/ Apple TV 2 and hooking it up to my TV. I decided to go with the latter. Not the best move. If you want to buy content from Apple, it may work well for you. If not, you have to jump through hoops or put up with inferior quality. Netflix and Hulu are not as good on the iPad or Apple TV as they are on a computer.

In fact, I should have stayed away from the Apple line in my HTPC decision... It would have been smarter to get a nice, Sony laptop and one of the WiDi boxes that allow you to screen share your PC with your TV. (I hate the idea of plugging a computer into HDMI with a cable). Then, when you play music from your laptop to your TV (connected to a stereo), you can trip out on the visualizer. Apple TV 2 has no visualizer. It has no horsepower. It is the iPhone 4 processor packed into a hockey puck with some output jacks slapped on. (from a design perspective, it is well done. I do think Apple are still great with hardware).

Tablets are toys. For example, if you want to surf the web on the iPad, there is no Flash. Indeed, people make a much bigger deal about this than it is, as most big websites offer the same content as h. 264 video. However, you will run into a few that only use Flash. You can use Photon, but it is not that great. It is true that Flash on mobile devices, even Android, is not very good. See? Tablets are toys!

The really bad thing is that Safari does not support the file upload html input element, so you cannot upload photos to sites like Ebay or Facebook. You need to use their apps. Why? Because iOS does not let you get into the directory structure. It is a toy. A consumer product. It is not cheap either.

Like I said, I should have just got a nice Windows 7 laptop and WiDi, which would have been better than a Mac Mini and a remote keyboard. The laptop can go anywhere and can be used without the TV. Why not get a Macbook and Apple TV 2 and use AirPlay? Because it does not support screen mirroring! I think there are third party solutions, like AirPlay Server (not made by Apple). But we know why they do this. If it doesn't fit into the Apple ecosystem, they don't want to put in much effort to support it. After all, if they did that, you might watch Hulu instead of paying for shows on iTunes. I shudder to think that Apple is rumored to be interested in aquiring Netflix and Hulu. If they do, say goodbye to affordable programming...

Oh, and if you want to buy a show or movie on Amazon and watch it on your TV with the Apple ecosystem, good luck. It is nit really possible with the iPad 2 or Apple TV 2, and if you do it on the Mac, you either need to plug into your TV, or maybe try the third party AirPlay screen sharing software, if it still exists or is any good...

The Intel WiDi system, with devices made by a few manufacturers, had 1080p for years before the new Apple TV 2 did. If you project Hulu or Netflix, full screen, onto your TV, it is 16:9 widescreen, etc. It is simlly a better HTPC setup than I can think of! Total buyers remorse. I will have to put up with this iCrap for a few years, until it is totally obsolete...

My Apple fanboy days are over. Everything I own is Apple, and I see more and more bugs and more creepy ""lock you in"" behavior every day. Look, I am not going to pay $4 to rent a movie or $1-4 to buy TV episodes. Even though I watch maybe an hour or so of video programming a day, I would end up spending $100+. I may as well have cable.

With the new Apple iBooks scandal, we can all see the writing on the wall. I also see Apple products, even the Mac, becoming less computers and more consumer toys. I bought my first Mac because I am a developer and needed a POSIX environment. Many times I wish I just got a decent Windows laptop and dual booted Ubuntu and Windows 7.

Apple quality has gone downhill bigtime recently. The new updates to Apple TV have it crashing quite often.

To make a long story short, if you want to buy content from Apple, an iPad may be fine. But if you want Netflix, Hulu and Amazon, you should look elsewhere. What? The iPad has Netflix and Hulu and Apple TV has Netflix built in? Yes. But they are not as good as the computer versions. To watch Hulu on your TV, you have to do a convoluted process, to get it to work somewhat well:

1. Close all the apps on your iPad
2. Shut down your iPad
3. Restart Apple TV
4. Start your iPad
5. Turn on screen sharing
6. Start Hulu

The closing apps and restarting the iPad was recommended to me by Hulu support, but restarting the Apple TV 2 seems to help a lot too. See? This is worse than Windows! Remember when Apple products didn't need to be rebooted comstantly to work?

That will get you Hulu on your TV, but it is  4:3 with content cut off. The video is jerky and (appearantly due to legal reasons) they can only have a 15 second buffer size, unlike the Flash based version.

I will say that the iPad 2 with Apple TV 2 can do some amazing things. A game like Metalstorm, played via AirPlay mirroring has a cool feature, where the iPad becomes a virtual cockpit (it is the game controller) and the game is on the screen. Indeed, an iPad with its gyroscope and acclerometer is a great gaming controller and gaming device.

That said, if you like stuff like World of Warcraft, you are better off with a Windows laptop. iOS is a great gaming platform, but I think Windows still has an edge for deeper games.

I am not a gamer. This was meant to replace cable TV, and does not do the best job. I was warned. I read a review in some tech mag that said the same thing... But I figured between Netflix, Hulu and the AirPlay feature, I had all my bases covered. Yes, but it is not a quality experience. It is often tears before bedtime.

If you want a consumer gadget toy kind of thing, the iPad is fine. Probably better than any other tablet out there. But I now think tablets are a fad. The press claims they are the future. People tend to settle for less, if told it is hot stuff. Look at Twitter, or the fact that most of us listen to music that has lesser audio quality than a CD (which doesn't sound as good as vinyl!). Heck, I settled for 720p for this setup. I could have spent the same amount of money, got a quality laptop (like a Sony, forgetabout Dell and HP), and a WiDi box, and had a way better experience... Along with having a real computer that I could use independent of my TV -- something with a real web browser, real applications... I gotta say, even Safari on a Mac is pretty bad. The app looks nice, but web pages are often poorly formatted and there is a bug that prevents me from using my bank's website!

See what I mean? Apple used to be the one that had quality. I think they have become arrogant and are resting on their laurels. Additionally, the influx of lame consumers combined with ""democratic design"" has them spending more time on Twitter integration than develping a decent mobile browser that can do something as basic as upload a file! Forget about Flash! These things can't even upload files! How can they? You have NO ACCESS to the file system. Even then, they could let you access the photo roll, but they were too busy setting up iCloud so they could gouge you, and putting in system wide Twitter integration for the iSheep idiots.

I used to get annoyed when the Phandroids and Apple haters called these iToys and the users iSheep. But there is a lot of truth to that.

I bought my iPad 2 about 10 months ago, and I have buyer's remorse. I had way too much faith in Apple. Keep in mind, they want you to buy their content. They are not going to bend over backwards to create a decent Hulu or Netflix experience. Who knows? Maybe these are purposefully hobbled so you will get fed up and just buy the show from iTunes.

But iTunes is not great. I have a decent internet connection, and it takes 2 hours to download a 1 hour show. They do not stream. In my opinion, Apple is a terrible internet company. For example, you can't even watch the video, on Apple's website, about the new iPad on the iPad 2. I have tried to backup my iPad 2 for a month now, but their iCloud stuff is so dead slow, it fails after a few hours, and the progress bar says it will take 10 hours to back up -- just the basic backup!

DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE! The iPad is the best tablet, but tablets are HYPED! You would be so much better off just getting a nice, small, quality laptop. Given the better integration of Windows 7 and WiDi for getting your stuff on the HDTV, I would even say, forget about getting a MacBook and Apple TV 2. Forget about a Mac Mini and a cumbersome remote keyboard. I have the worst Apple hangover right now! It just hit me how limited a lot of their stuff is... Their nice ecosystem can be done better, and with more options and choices. I'd rather play music from a Windows 7 laptop to my TV/stereo through a WiDi box, and get the visualizer and all that jazz...

I used to really love Apple products, but they have lost their luster. I don't think products like the iPad 2, the new iPad, and Apple TV2 meet the needs of even most consumers. The fact that the Mac is slowly becoming a big iPad makes me wish I had opted for a Windows/Ubuntu system.

Did I mention that after the iOS 5.1 release and the new Apple TV 2 update, AirPlay has crashed on me about 8 times. It probably would have crashed more, but I often just listen to the radio instead now. Pathetic, eh? Yep, Windows ain't lookin' so bad now!

Apple is becoming way too oriented to the average consumer. If you cut the cord (ditch cable) and go with Apple, you will pay as much, if not more for content, especially if you have a family. Don't buy an iPad 2 and an Apple TV 2 and expect Netflix and Hulu to work very well. This is no slam on either of those companies -- I think they rock! The best Netflix snd Hulu experiences are computer based (I have not tried Roku, Boxee, etc.)

You should not have to pay $4-5 to rent a movie, or $2-3 to buy a TV show. WTF? I don't want to watch that same episode of The Office more than once.

Just like this iBooks scandal, it is clear that Apple is here to suck you dry. You were warned!"	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Every few weeks I have to update the software. iTunes fires up. Decides it needs an update. it also tries to get me to install quicktime and safari - which i decline to download - for the 10th time. it downloads and installs its update. it wants to restart my computer. it restarted. now i download the ipad update. now it wants to sync. it takes 10 minutes just to sync my ipad. now its updating. and when it's done, iTunes, for the 10th time, wants to know why its not the default player for my music. the entire process seems to take 45 minutes. i really expect better from Apple.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"This review is for the general public looking for something easy and fun to use. I am not a techie and have never owned a tablet until yesterday when I purchased a Galaxy Tablet 10.1. I loved this tablet but sadly had to return it this morning when I learned that I was lied too about its ability to connect with a VGA projector. After returning the Galaxy Tablet 10.1 this morning because of its inability to connect to a VGA output I found myself reluctantly purchasing an i-pad 2 16gb tablet. I wish I had never returned the Galaxy Tablet 10.1!! In terms of usability the Samsung Galaxy Tablet 10.1 was super easy and within minutes I was sending off emails using voice control, etc... however the I-Pad 2 left me flustered all afternoon long and I am still in shock at how complicated and convoluted getting things to work on it is. For instance 1) Before I could download anything needed for work I had to up-grade the OS! 2) Once OS-5 was installed I bought three (3) apps - keynote, pages, some PDF reader and I also installed Netflix for free. I had to uninstall and then re-install all four (4) app's in order to get them to work properly! Then, it turns out that the i-pad 2 doesn't actually charge whilst plugged into the computer via its usb port?! The battery life is not ten hours either! After five hours of feverishly trying to figure this thing out I was way below 30% battery life! I found the applications very frustrating to access and EVERYTHING forces you to use APPLE ""something or another..."" be it music, files, pictures, etc... if you like having options than avoid the i-pad... it leaves you feeling like you have been run over after all of the new accounts you have to set up just to get it to turn on properly out of the box.

Compared to the Galaxy Tablet 10.1, everything was super easy to use and ready to go. It also comes with Polaris Office which is just as nice as keynote and pages in my opinion and it is FREE! I wrote a review about the Galaxy Tablet 10.1 expressing my disappointment that Samsung is being so short sighted about not having an VGA adapter for it. However, I could find no fault with the tablet itself or its applications. It left me feeling upset that I had to return it as I loved it so much. However, the Apple i-pad has left me so angry after hours of jerking me around that I can't wait to bring it back tomorrow and be rid of it. I also have the arduous task of trying to get my money back for the apps keynote and pages... both $10.00 each. I will confess that now that everything is finally set up and once you succumb to Apple's monopoly over how software is transferred from your computer to the tablet (i-tunes - sigh!) both keynote and pages preserve your Microsoft word and PowerPoint documents very nicely and is usable immediately. The Apple i-pad also has a proper VGA adapter for its i-pad... but it is NOT as user friendly as people or Apple itself makes it out to be and has left me wanting to return it regardless. Also, unlike the Galaxy Tablet, it does not allow you to swipe the screen from left to right and limits you to the basic top to bottom functions. The keyboard is inferior to the Galaxy tablet as well. For whatever reason the i-pad doesn't even have a tab key despite the fact that there is a blank space where the tab key usually is on any normal keyboard, including the Galaxy tablet 10.1! Just to type in some of my passwords I have to literally change the keyboard options three (3) times! This is only a problem for people like me who actually make full use of all the keys on a qwerty key board when making passwords and such. The Galaxy Tablet keyboard was simple and easy to use. It was as good as typing on a laptop keyboard! I also found some really great books for free via the Galaxy whereas most of the free books for the i-pad is just crap. Apple should spend more time on perfecting its products instead of introducing new ones every six months!

Bottom Line: if you do not need to use VGA projectors than buy the Galaxy Tablet 10.1. I am heartbroken that I could not have kept that one. Leave Apple to those who like it for what it is. Personally, I'd sooner use a Remington Typewriter than the i-pad!

UPDATE:

I returned this iPad and purchased the Galaxy 10.1 Tablet again and couldn't be happier! I found a way around the projector problem too which is great. My only regret is having bothered to purchase the iPad at all."	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	this isn't the newest model they need to bring the ipad 3 all of the customers are patiently waiting for preorder and they are getting antsy	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The new features for Ipad3 are nothing new to the Tablet industry as compared to other tablets on the market 1 year ago. Apple just trying to play catch up game with other tablets still lacking connectivity to interface all platforms & removable SD memory cards to swap in and out. They are trying slowly release few features with every revision so not to run out of bullets.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I just acquired the Ipad 2. I'm a veteran who is a professional artist and student attending college.
My VA counselor chose it for me because she thought it would be beneficial for me to show my work on to potential employers.
I read a few reviews on it before hand, and I was already not thrilled about the non-USB support.
After I opened everything up, I noticed there was no quick installation guide or anything telling me what goes with what and so forth. I'm more of a PC person, and my knowledge of Macs are basic, but I was able to figure things out.

The apps that they say are free, are not really free. They ask for your credit card number at the app store.
About all I can do with this thing is load my pics and music on it. It doesn't even come with a head phone jack.
It does not recognize the Blue toothe wireless keyboard that came with it.
All the content that you load must be loaded through Itunes.

There is also no Flash support. I don't like the virtual keyboard.

If I want to browse the Internet, and use email, I prefer to use my laptop.
Although my laptop is much heavier, I see no real replacement for it when it comes to showing off my work on the spot. I am actually more impressed with the Kindle Tablet than I am with the Ipad2.

In my opinion, the Ipad2 is cool for the average person, but for a professional artist like myself, its pretty lame.

I need a device that I can load my motion graphic, video/film, and animation clips to, and be PDF compatible.
I'm really disappointed with this product, as it does not meet my personal or professional needs."	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	After using the iPad 2 for about six months I can definitely say that I can't wait for the Windows 8 tablet to be released. The iPad 2 is a neat toy but it is too limitd to use for any productive purposes. Number one on the list is no Flash. I can't even tell you how many times I've had to put the iPad 2 aside and grab a Windows laptop to look at a Web page. At this point, if I want to be productive I grab a Windows laptop. If I want to play games I grab the iPad 2.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The functionality and capability are great. The big drawback is that it does not run Flash and Java, which eliminates about a third of all web content...	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I am writing this review from my HP Touchpad. I bought my husband the IPad 2 for a Christmas present, gave it to him early [1 week early], so it could be up and running for Xmas day. Well it will not print to our network that has an HP 4600dnt LaserJet printer, bummer. I have spent about 3 hours trying to figure out different apps to make it work. Fortunately he is not at this time a hard core tech, not even a small time one and might not really need to print anything, just play games. I have tried to figure out Air Print and it looks like it will only work with newer printers that have the program installed, so just be aware.

Lot of money and appears to be better, easier up start products on the market. I think some Apple people are just so use to apple products and just don't know there are other quality, products that operate the same that are maybe half to 3/4's of the cost. It took me an hour just to figure out how to get a desktop on the Ipad. I had to hook up the Ipad to my pc then go to a website to download, I have never had to do that with any other product that wasn't an Apple product.

Hopefully this helps someone that is on the fence with an Apple product.

Update 12-26-2011. Well I have been every forum everywhere and have got just a load of info and wonderful people with lots of suggestions and man, this apple stuff is tough on compatibility even within it's own community. I have never cared for Apple products and nothing has changed.

Thanks to all who have tried to help, just glad this belongs to my husband, who just wants to play games and see his racing forms."	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I have been a hold out for several years now.  I would tell people ""I have an iPhone so why get just a bigger version?""  My wife wanted to get an e-reader so I decided to put my money where my mouth was and buy a couple of iPads for us.  Hers would likely be a casual use device but I was going to try to use mine for business moving to a paperless work style (attempt #1,324 over the course of 12 years of different devices).

Initial review was good... liked the device feel, weight, etc.  Clearly it looked nice.  I was offended at the cost of covers and accessories but I had somewhat gotten over that shock with the iPhone so it wasn't a new shock :) I felt that a lot of the app makers did a good job with their iPhone/iPad combined apps but it does suck to have to buy a separate app for those that don't have the combined versions.  But, overall a nice design and fun product to use.

But, there's a big but here, it's too fragile and no recourse from an accident.  Like many others before me I broke mine.  Total bone-head move on my part, not at all an Apple fault in my situation, but if you spend some time reviewing forums you'll see the advice I failed to read.  The device is incredibly fragile so even simple (aka not bone-headed) slips, drops, and bumps will leave you with a busted screen.  With no attractive means of recourse.  One would think that any product with a propensity for a major functional piece to break there would be a repair option.  Not the case with Apple.  Probably part of the business plan to be honest.  I tried to find out my options and costs (secretly hoping for a free replacement like others have touted) but two different stores told me 1) not repairable by anyone; 2) any signs or attempt at repair void warranty; and 3) only option is a ""courtesy"" replacement for $270 (16mb wifi version).  No option for repair internally at Apple, let alone an option more reasonable than spending another $300.  I checked and the local repair place quoted about $185 plus tax and the parts I found online looked to run about $150+.  For a glass screen!

Apple has a unique luxury in that they have a large client base that feels Apple can do no wrong.  An Apple ""genius"" could swing by the house at Thanksgiving and slap the loyalists grandmother and Apple would still be held up on a pedestal - the turkey was dry after-all.  So they don't bat an eye if iTunes misbehaves (the user shouldn't have tried to sync contacts), or if they try to connect with Outlook (the user shouldn't consider another product not made by Apple), or consider a good product would have given repair considerations to a critical yet fragile component.  The Apple flock is a great thing to have for a business.

So anyway, I would say the iPad is a great device.  It'd be better if the screen were more widget based like the android options, but it's snazzy, quick, and a joy to use.  But, leave it sitting alone on the desk and protect it with your life if you buy it.  Otherwise buy an android option for half the price and if you could bust it three times and still be less expensive than the Apple will arguably as good of performance."	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I'm a college student with a laptop and I was lent this for a semester. The Ipad is pretty much useless if you have a laptop or a desktop... So unless you want to look cool in front of other I would suggest not getting an Ipad or even invest in a good computer. I would say the games are fun but that's pretty much it.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I bought an Ipad 2 32 gig version before coming to college in hopes of using it as an ereader.  It was absolutely amazing for about the first hour that I used it.  However, once the novelty of it has worn off it isn't extremely useful.  I was only able to find two of my textbooks available as an ebook so I only saved about $50.  Taking into consideration that I paid $600 for it, I most likely will not be able to save any money like I was initially hoping.  Though the Ipad is a fun toy to have around, the apps for it are pretty fun, and it has internet browsing capabilities, it only has about 80% of the utility of using a computer.  For this reason I find myself never really using it for anything and I plan to sell mine before next semester.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I bought the white 16GB ipad during the black friday deals on the apple page, for around 450 plus tax, so hardly cheaper than on Amazon now.

I did buy this for my parents, based on reviews. All reviews agree on the following: 1) the ipad is still the best tablet around and 2) it is the easiest to use. Well, both statements are wrong. Since so much has been said already on the ipad let me get straight to the issues:

- Being an android user (phone-wise) I got so used to the back button. On the ipad there is no such thing. If you push home, you get straight to home screen. If you want to go back one stap within an app, touch the screen and search and search for ""back"" on the screen. It is very inefficient. Also when installing multiple apps from the market you have to go back and forth several times.

- The screen resolution is too low. Webpages do not look as good as on other tablets. While 4:3 format makes some sense, given that you use it also in portrait, the low resolution looks just outdated. Ok, I knew that before, but I did not expect it to be as disturbing.

- Google. Apple fights its war with google to the disadvantage of consumers. No Picasa integration! Seriously, this is just poitics! They want to take control over you, so you are not supposed to use google sevices. You will also miss other google apps if you know android.

- No official google talk! Say goodbye to you android using friends.

- Amazon. They had to circumvent Apples policy using a web app for their services. Just because they want to force you into itunes. Once you are in itunes, you are forced into buying apple products forever. Why give up the freedom of choice? Lets say apple products were getting worse and in 5 years all your money is in itunes items. Do you want that? Hell, no. If you buy music with Amazon you remain independent of the hardware provider at least. The ipad is a mere retail channel (like the kindle fire, only more expensive). It does not give you freedom like galaxy tab.

- USB. No real port. Ok, buy the adapter. 30 bucks. Find out it serves only 20mah. So it is not USB, as it is not following the standard which 100. It is disfunctional! You need workarounds.

- The whole device is about workarounds. Apps. Paid apps! Apple earns on programms that give you DLNA, THE STANDARD to stream movies to your tv. Or they earn on making you buy the apple tv box. But Apple just ignores and established standard.

- Antitrust, where are you? Microsoft would have been sued to death for what apple is doing here!!!

- File access. Forget it. This is again about workarounds. Dropbox etc. Well, but I wanted this for my parents. Supposed to be easy, but IT IS NOT. It is f difficult to find all the f workarounds. To start actually working with this.

Conclusion. Decent pad to surf with nonflash browser. Bound to apple channels for buying digital stuff, basically a retail access you are paying for. Imagine paying your supermarket just for being there. Everything else is disfunctional, not following standards, locking you in, making you search for workarounds and thereby stealing your time. It is NOT EASY to use, compared with android.

Get something else. Not the ipad."	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"My order of this item has just been canclled without any notification and explaination.
Is this an special issue? I am really disappointed about this! Hope it never happen again."	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"The iPad yeah I bought one. I tried the android smartphones too... Didn't like them. Tried the Apple for two weeks and I am ready to sell it.
Get a good grip on it right out of the box... It is very slippery to hold/easy to drop.
You need an adapter to use it with ANYTHING external. SD Cards... need an adapter. USB devices... need an adapter and they better not pull to much power or you will get an error. Apple operating system for a windows user it is a nightmare! I like to sit down with something and figure it out. I'm not much on reading manuals.  I want to pick it up and use it. FORGET that with an iPad! I had to ask questions for almost everything. How about UNDO command... On Windows just click the command.  Apple... SHAKE THE iPad and the command will pop up (unless you dropped the iPad!).
I don't know which came first the iPad or the Android but they are very much alike and I am very frustrated with both.
So the iPad gets Sold and I bought a Windows 7 netbook instead.

Either I am too smart for iPad/Android or too dumb.

Okay I am cured. I am no longer looking at Apple and wondering what the big deal is... There is none!

Hope this was helpful.

B0013FRNKG	"I recently purchased an iPad2.  On first install, it worked fine.  However, there was an OS update to version 5 available, so I decided to update it.  A BIG mistake.  Version 5 of the operating system has major bugs in it.  At the moment, every time I try to sync it with iTunes, it isn't recognized so it resets.  With over 40 Gigs of music, video, and data this ends up being a 2 to 3 hour process.  I'm sure it will be fixed eventually, but to have major problems with this product less than 24 hours after I've purchased it is a big problem.  Apple should have tested the new OS better before releasing it to the public.

I recommend not buying this product now, but if you do, be sure not to update the operating system to version 5.  You will regret it."	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I found it to be less mobile than a smart phone and less useful than a netbook.  It was fun to play with for a few weeks but now I never use it.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I received this from my employer.

Here are my observations

Pros:

Lightweight
Portable
Surf Internet
eReader

Cons:

Device is slippery - definitely need case or other backing or it could easily be dropped

Screen can easily be scratched  unless you have a stand or some way of keeping it off your desk

Keyboard is lacking tab, arrow keys,  switching between letters and numbers/symbols is inconceivable for a device you type on.  3rd keyboard for  special characters, keyboard covers up screen. During online chat the chat window from agent disappeared when I started typing.

Making corrections to this review I can't scroll down to information I already typed.  No arrow keys,  had to preview then edit, the hit return then delete returns.

Hard to place cursor between letters even using a stylus

In app store some games say they are free but eventually you must buy to continue.  Many of the thousands of apps are games and not many useful apps for business.

Hard to scroll in form (like this on).  Every time I try to place the cursor I get a pop to cut, copy etc

Reading books hard because thumb placement on device can inadvertently turn pages or other thumb can take you out of book and to the desktop. Also must hold iPad to read comfortably.

Battery life is okay but I expected more (been using for 2 hours am down to 63% from fully charged, now down to 54%

You need a computer as you have to sync with iTunes.  Also, have not found a way to delete apps off iPad without iTunes

No USB ports, memory not expandable

Large for everyday use and since back is so slippery is hard to hold securely unless you have a case.

Conclusion:

The more I use it the less I like it.

This doesn't do much more than a Palm Pilot and the palm can fit easily in your pocket or purse, has onscreen keyboard, graffiti, wifi, sd slot, Bluetooth, real word and excel software, email, built-in calculator, eReader, music, etc.  Too bad they are no longer available except on eBay.

However, if you want a 10"" screen then a netbook is much more useful.  A real OS, flash support, large hard drive, screen can be adjusted for optimal viewing, USB ports, and the list goes on.  Portability is not much different and you can get a lot more for your money.  Price is another plus.

I would never have bought this for myself.  As I finish this the battery is at 56%.  Typing this has been tedious and draining."	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Was disappointed to learn, post purchase, that the device was not new and had been originally purchased by another individual.  As such, the 90-day Apple warranty is no longer in effect.  I found nothing in the original ad nor subsequent documentation so indicating.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"First I'm not an Apple hater. I returned the product for several reasons I felt to be valid:

<1.>  It's still too heavy and it's not very ergonomic. This product is not comfortable for me to hold for long periods. I would say I'm of average strength (I can do 10 overhand pull-ups). I didn't purchase it to prop it up on a desk. I can use a laptop for that. The 10"" Android tablets I've held are too heavy too. I think I might be happier with a 7"" tablet.

<2.>  A certain social networking app I use on the iPod all the time stinks on the iPad. I don't know why they couldn't come up with something better than: A. Open it iPhone size. B. Stretch it with a nasty 2x zoom that really displays poorly.

<3.>  There are a ton of iPhone apps, not so much for the iPad. And the aforementioned problem keeps me from wanting to run iPhone apps on the pad. I don't want to have to fight with jail-breaking the device just to run an app full-screen. There do seem to be plenty of games, but I didn't get it for that.

<4.>  It doesn't even include a calculator. Sure you can download a calculator from the app store. With the added bonus of a big iAd in the middle of the screen. I didn't know I was getting a $600 iPad with Special Offers.

In short I would not purchase this product without planning to jail-break it. If you do that I hear of all sorts of trouble with upgrades and, of course, no Apple support. The bright spot, the electronics store I purchased from let me return it without even charging me a restocking fee."	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Great tablet all around except for the minor detail that it has MAJOR wifi connectivity issues. It cuts out about 1 every 2 minutes, making the thing nearly worthless when doing anything online (which, for me, is about 70% of the time). What's the point? Apple claims this is a minor issue affecting only some users, but if you go on their support pages or google the issue, it is clear this is a very wide-spread problem.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"It was with sadness that I returned it - felt like I was returning the Future. But here's why:
1) It was too heavy for me to rest comfortably on lap while lying down.
2) I had to purchase GoodReader to see if that would work for the main reason I wanted an ipad2 (to dowload and read academic pdfs from a certain website and zip files from another speciality website). I should have done this to see if it was compatable, but by the time I figured this out I had already invested so much time getting this to work right and had had enuf.
3) Similarly, i would have to purchase a stylus to see if I could find one that worked for me. I'm used to using wrist movments and finger movements to work for long periods of time - not upper arm movements - so I would have to use a stylus. was not prepared cause I thought my styluses I already have would work on the IPAD
4) Worst onscreen keyboard I have ever used. You have to hit a seperate key to make numbers and symbols like @ appear, and then hit the key again to return to letters. Perhaps i'd get used to this, perhaps not. so for, not.
5) Similarly, if you can't touch type with the keyboard (you can't, I tried) then why space them out so far from one another? or why not let it be modifyable depending on the needs of the user?
6) in the app store the print is too tiny. Much to my surprise, I could not expand it in the usual way. I did not bother to see if there was another way to expand it
7) there's something dizzying about the way it switches between screens.
8) Apple's official position is that they will not support WIFI conncections that use the older WEP security. Their only advice is to upgrade to WPA which they are happy to help you with excpet they don't care about the problem that then my older two devices would not be able to connect...So if have intermittant trouple with wifi because of WEP, don't count on Apples help. It took me ages to access some firmware to upgrade, only to find that i can't use WPA.
9)In the store, the Ipad I tried got so dim as to be practically black. that's what I want for the dim lighting i use it in. My unit does not get as dim as that one. It's probably ok though.
10) The final straw was an irrational one I guess...I decided to take a break from figuring things out and watch some stuff from NBC. I had not realized NBC does not support IPAD. the shows are on hulu but why shyould I pay 8 bucks a month when I can watch for free on my laptop. Other people have commented that they are going to start watching more ABC. I would rather find a table that lets me watch what I want.
11)and ok, one more, i would also like to upload files to a speciality website, but didn't check to see if there's an app for that...
12) I hate all the going thru ITUNES, a behmoth that now sits on my laptop, though i'd probably get used to this.

Overall, Apple is really great at creating problems and then offering to sell you an App for that (no usb, no Word, no excel, can't upload or download files etc.). This is great if your main purpose is to show things to people. Big screen and without a cumbersome keyboard in the way.

I might try and IPOD touch. same idea, but lighter. so now i'd still have to get goodreader and try again..."	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Bought an IPAD for my wife so we could talk while I was out of the country for 9 mo. It worked great the month before I left. One week after I left, it would not go online any more. Since it had only been 40 days she called apple and they reset it, but that did not fix it. So she had to send it in the day before she was going away for a week, the one time that she really needed to keep in touch with me. Apple should have replaced it and sent us a new while they fixed our lemon of an ipad. We have been apple customers for 3 mo, not so impressed with their customer service. I thought their OS was supposedly without problems. Story to be continued after they send back our now refurbished $700 Ipad that is 40 days old. If I wanted a refurbished one I could have paid $400, and I would have expected this kind of action.	2	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"I bought this for travel and business. The lightness and portability is cool, and it seems rather seamless until I went to use on my work websites...then oh no, they wouldnt work. Well, I went looking for apps....and guess what, there aren't any for those websites. UGH! No updates, apps, or workarounds. Im stuck using it for emails and some websites, and a few apps. My mistake as I should have known they used Flash. Im just glad I didn't buy a 3G model or I really would have tossed more cash in the fire. I should have done better research, but figured there would be some sort of workaround, but there is not as of now. I would have been much better off with another of the competitors that used flash.

Also there is very limited expandability. This is more of a gadget and not a computer or even a netbook. At least I can get on websites and use it with a netbook.

It will allow me to stay connected through emails and some do some slow surfing, but thats really the extent of it.

This is a very sad disappointment for business use...."	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This was a present for my mother's birthday. The plan was she would take it to her vacation abroad. Unfortunately, the device could not be turned on. On the last minute, we had to go and get it repaired, and it turned out to be a known problem. It's working fine now, but she only has it for a week, and I wonder what will go wrong next....	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"First, when you guys say 500,000 application, do you really count the silly games as useful applications?
For business, this device is Nothing to me. You won't believe how many times I wanted to leave it home and take my MacBook with me again. Believe me, I love Apple products, in fact waited inline for this silly product the second year around, First for iPad and now for iPad 2.
It all comes down to this: When things are too simple, things become too complicated. No real, heavy duty operating system. If I specify why this thing isn't working for my business, I will need 5 pages to fill. I have in the past posted a review on how great this product was, but that was before really trying it for business,
Its not even okay for simple web browsing and I am not talking about flash blah blah, because I never encountered a website that didn't run on the iPad, but Im talking physically, To hold it down it made my neck hurt, A MacBook is far more comfortable, you look vertically and type horizontally.
Again, I wait in line for iPhone, every single version of it, I adore my MacBook pro and can never switch back to a PC but this stupid device, I will never buy again. YUK.
Im thinking to buy the new 11.6"" MacBook Air instead.

B0013FRNKG	"I recently purchased a new iPad 2 for $829.99. I had such high hopes for this little device. Then was astonished at how it didn't even come close to my medium-low expectations.

Here it goes:  The auto rotate is slow and suddenly will rotate when tilted randomly. When you don't have the wall plug-in it will not recharge while plugged into a laptop. The touch pad is either so sensitive or will NOT work At ALL after many attempts. Apple says it has a 10hr battery life - try five hours at best. A data package must be bought to use the Wi-Fi when the advertisement says it can be used right out of the package. You have to buy iTunes comparable packages to use the iPad. Free Apps are NOT all free - there is usually a fee to make them work to the point they are enjoyable. Don't even try to upload ANY of your own music or movies. Apple is sooo proprietary that if you didn't buy the music or movies through iTunes you can't use it on the iPad. And when you try to access the Internet, better-off using your Mac/PC. Moreover, accessing Wikipedia or nearly any other sites that uses videos to enhance the info, entertainment, music you can only watch around 70% of the content. Sure, the Flash is not available for iPad but it should be able to play the other videos. On Aug 5th, I called Mac customer service and the rep even said he could not believe Apple sent out the iPad 2 without some kind of plug-in or app to make the iPad more user friendly with the Internet. Oh, one more, DO NOT set the iPad face down or it will slip off nearly any surface you think is flat. The front surface is so slippery.

I don't have the time to list and all negative experiences have been experienced only owning it for three months. However, I must say, the screen is bright and clear. The iPad is light and sturdy. The apps that do work, work VERY well. The processor is extremely FAST! It is not a horrible product. It just needs to mature a little.

I have been using Apple/Mac and PC products for more than three decades and could not speak higher of the quality and ease of use of Apple/Mac until now. I'll probably be buying a different brand like a HP Slate 500, LG G-Slate, Viewsonic ViewPad 7, RIM BlackBerry PlayBook - to name a few next time unless I pad 4 is more compatible with reality. Please, for the love of all good things, heed my advice and DO NOT BUY THIS! (At least not yet.) Nearly ANY other pad/tablet at two thirds the price will do much more than the iPad 2.

* NOTE * DO NOT BUY THE iPad magnetic Smart Cover. It easily slips off and WILL traumatically send your iPad to an early demise.

No, I would not recommend this to a family member or friend at this time. Remember, we are at the very beginning of the pad/tablet generation! Every year as the Internet develops, the tablets will follow. Good luck!"	2	electronics

No USB port.
Needs to be improved.
Wish I had compared against other versions."	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Really? What a pain in the butt! Every site I want to go to needs flash!? I'v been an Apple fan for a long time mow! Now I want all my money back from gen 1! No one from A$$ple will read this! So please buyer beware!!!	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	What a stupid idea when Apple need you to download itune and sync it with the device before you can use it? It should work just like an iphone out of the box. I have nothing against itune, but the support on window systems really sucks and upgrade it is a nightmare, with bulky download. In this new device centric + cloud computing world, what a stupid idea when you need to sync your device with a dumb PC?? Totally brain dead	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Apple markets this as the ultimate portable computer product, but it has serious shortcomings similar to the iPhone that I wasn't aware of as I don't own one.  If you have no interest in external files or photos, then this may not be important to you.  I waited a month for mine to be delivered, and after a week, I can say I'm keenly disappointed for specific reasons of Apple's own making.

You can't transfer ANY file to it, you can only SYNC all files from one designated computer, i.e. tethered.

Despite reading enormous reviews & comments about the original, as well as the 2, I never got the impression from anyone that this was the case.  There were a few rumblings about ""file handling"" and workarounds for it [""everything's going to the cloud anyway"" ""just use dropbox""] - but nothing that says what an incredible restriction it is for anyone using photos/movies at all.  Their only official solution is that you buy a $40 dongle that then will allow SD card content [no CF cards, which I have]  to be transferred directly.  But the worst part is that even if you were to transfer anything to it, it all gets dumped at the bottom of  ""saved photos"" without any file separation, and no ability to separate or make collections of them after transfer either.

Unlike my iPods, you can NEVER transfer any existing file to another, or create a new one.  Only with Sync.  Apparently they want you to work ""with the app"" to do whatever you want to do.  So the only way you could store photos is randomly, unless you want to sync all file/photos from your one mothership computer.  The only semi-solution is to email yourself whatever you want, then download the photos/files...which again will only be dumped in the ""saved photo"" generic file.  You can imagine the limitations with original file sizes.

Another key element to me is the lack of any tabbed browsing, whether in Safari or the special Bing app for the iPad [superior to Safari for most things].  So to actually write an email, while constantly switching between single browser pages etc. I'd find ridiculously cumbersome, not to mention that you can't resize ANY windows/apps at all.  You can only resize font/content within a given page.

Which brings me to the keyboard, or lack thereof.  I had no idea that the numeric/symbol part of the keyboard is ALWAYS separate from the alpha part, meaning that if you're ever entering alpha/numeric content, i.e. passwords, airline record #'s etc. you have to hit one key to show the number part, hit the number/symbol, then hit another key to reveal the alpha part again, and back and forth endlessly.  In addition, because there's no real tactile feel for the keys, and because the entry points are different for every program [where the browser bar is vs input for youtube etc] you're staring at the keyboard to make sure your fingers are in the right place, then having to look back up and find where it's going, then back down etc., which not only slows the process, but can give you a headache from your neck bobbing up & down, as well as the different light/contrast levels for the keyboard vs the rest of the screen.

Yes - I know that you can get a separate bluetooth keyboard, and that would solve some of it - but it also defeats some of the advantage of the form factor if you have to haul the 2 around everywhere you go.

This doesn't even address any particular program you may want to work on - just the physical/OS realities of trying to work with it at all.

Yes - scrolling through photos is very fast, and can be easily manipulated with your fingers.  Yes there are some very inventive apps out there that take advantage of finger-abilities, but what the finger giveth, it also taketh away when it comes to anything that requires content creation or precision.  I never expected it to do something like Photoshop, but to be this crippled wasn't in the cards either.

This should be marketed to generic users not comfortable with computers, and iPhone users who are used to--and don't want anything more than what their iPhone will already do.  The geeks that have championed it should be dismissed for misleading everyone, as they will always find workarounds, and have multiple devices anyway [macbook air/pro/imac etc].  They could just as easily make an Android phone/tablet work for them.

The strength of Apple is supposed to be it's user-friendliness, flexibility and support...with their advertising just teasing out a few of the myriad possibilities of the device.  In the iPad's case, I feel they did the opposite:  they oversold it's abilities, touting dual-core ships, 9x better graphics etc., when in fact none of that really matters at the only pace the interface allows.  [I got my mom a refurb original iPad, the first computer she can work - and there's little difference in most app performance]

At the direction of my local Genius Bar & Store Manager, I went in search of an app that could help with photo file/transfer, but I queried one of the best reviewed, ""PhotoSync"" to be sure they responded:

""PhotoSync can only transfer photos to the save photos folder. This restriction is made by Apple unfortunately. Third party developers are not allowed to create albums in the camera roll, save photos in other locations than the saved photos folder, or to delete photo from the camera roll.  All these features Apple reserves completely for itself.  We hope that this will change one day in a newer iOS version but at this point it is the only thing we can offer (though we would like to offer more).""

That may be plenty for most others, but it's not for me.  I went back to see if I skipped parts of reviews that mentioned this, and no - i didn't.  Here's from Mossberg from WSJ...who runs down all the drawbacks, including poor-quality cameras etc., then says:

""there are two big omissions, one old and one new. The old one is that, like Apple's prior phones and tablets, the shiny new iPad 2 still won't play Adobe's Flash video in its built-in Web browser. This is a deliberate decision by Apple, and puts its devices at a disadvantage for some users when compared with Android tablets, which can play Flash, or say they will soon, albeit not always well.

The other omission has to do with cellular data. The iPad 2 can't use, or be upgraded to use, the new, faster 4G cellular-data networks being rolled out.""

NO mention of any of the aspects that are important to me, and I would think to a substantial number of people...even if we aren't a majority.

I want it to be the Next Big Thing - the one that replaces laptops with a smaller, more flexible form factor that's also inspiring to use.

I'm just left with the deflated feeling that I've been had, and mostly because of some very dumb and ridiculous failures in their OS that don't have to be that way...just sticking a finger in my eye as a dedicated Mac user.

**Update** I got the 11"" Macbook Air and am very happy with it - although it is a lot more computer power than I needed in pure portable terms -  it isn't substantially bigger than the iPad [especially with keyboard] for those of you that can afford it."	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Very nice for games, social networking, etc.  Of little use for serious business use.  Very unituitive and without instructions.  The one book I bought on ipad was of little use.	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I received a black iPad 2 with 32 GB for my birthday from my lovely wife. It's a beautiful product, as with all other Apple products I have purcThe hased however.....the Wi-Fi capability is not so good. It works for a while and then stops working. I called Apple. They had me delete the password for my network and then put the password back in. It worked fine for a while...just as it did when I first installed it. But only for a while. I don't get it. I have a relatively new Belkin 2 wireless network on Cable and have been using it for several years. I have two laptop computers, two printers, and an iPod touch with Wi Fi. They all work just fine. I can work all day, every day on any of these devices from anywhere in my house or in my yard.

But not with the iPAD 2.

with the iPad 2 it works for a while and then stops working. Very frustrating.

This is not only a review but a request for help if anyone knows what's going on.

BELOW IS A FOLLOW-UP ON MY IPAD2:

BTW IF YOU DON'T WANT TO READ ALL OF THIS, HERE IS A QUICK SUMMARY OF THE MOST IMPORTANT POINTS:

1. It never worked properly on my home network or other networks I tried at Starbucks, shopping centers, etc.
2. It was too big and heavy.
3. To read a book on it was a problems because it was heavy and just touching a little part of the screen caused pages to flip by very fast which meant I had to search for where I was about every few minutes.
4. Even though I bought a 2 years warranty, sent it in for repair and eventually got a new/used one from Apple it still never solved any of the problems.
5. Apple never would do anything substantive for me...like give me my money back or give me an Apple credit. So in the end I had to sell it for what I could get - $400, which meant I lost $250+plus the accessories, apps, the Warranty etc. I had spent.

I am NOT an Apple basher and I enjoy my iPods (3) we have in our family. However, I'll never buy Apple again because of their ""return"" ""credit"" etc. policy. They have really made me unhappy with this experience and I did everything I could to work with them.

I got an iPad2 with 32Gig memory ($599) + a ""magic cover"" ($60) from Loretta for my birthday this year. The ""magic cover"" is magnetic. It covers and protects the screen of the iPad2 when you're not using it and turns the machine on and off by putting the cover on and off. I also bought an $80 2-year warranty service. So all in all, without tax and shipping, we spent about $720 for the thing. The short story is the iPad2 didn't work for me. It wouldn't stay connected to our network. Every time I wanted to use it I had to go through the network settup process all over again. Apple Customer Service was no help. After hours with them I sent it in for ""repair."" I got it back and it worked exactly the same, which is to say, it didn't work exactly as it didn't work before I sent it in. I kept asking for my money back or a credit but they kept refusing. Finally I sent it to them and they sent me a ""new"" (i.e. new to ME) unit. That's right, they did NOT say they would give me a new iPad2. They said they would give me a ""refurbished"" unit. I thought this was crappy since I'd only owned the thing for a month and had spent most of that time on the phone with their service department. Anyway, I got a ""new"" unit and it worked the same...i.e. it didn't work. Again, they refused to give me my money or a credit. So I finally just sold it. I got $400 for it so we lost about $350 (with shipping and tax).
Besides not hooking up to our network, it was also big and heavy and no fun to sit and read books or browse the web or do any of the things I wanted it for. Reading a book, for example was a hassle. You had to hold this big heavy thing by the very edge of the ""frame"" because if you touched the screen anywhere it would flip through pages FAST and I spent most of my time trying to find where I left off. A real pain.
Apart from all of that, the iPad2 is beautiful, has a beautiful screen and presents a beautiful, rich, colorful picture of whatever you're viewing. But not that much better than my Dell laptop.
By the way, I KNOW our network works. It's the most recent Belkin WAP2 system and it works flawlessly with both of our Dell laptops, our DELL wireless color printer and our Brother wireless Laser Printer. I also had an Apple iPod Touch which worked perfectly using our same Wireless network. So it HAD to be something in the iPad2 that just didn't work. Anyway, I don't think I'll buy anything more from Apple, mainly because that even when something doesn't work right out of the box they won't give your money back or even give you a credit.
What I DID buy and am very happy with, is an Amazon Kindle Latest Generation Wi Fi for $140 + $60 for a leather cover with built in reading light which actually works.
The networking on the Kindle works great...just like our Dell Laptops and our printers.
For more money, you can get a Kindle with not only Wi Fi but also 3G, so it will work using your phone network as well as your home network. We didn't need that feature though.
The Kindle is great for reading books, magazines, newspapers, etc. You can get thousands of free books, but current books, or subscriptions to periodicals will cost you. If I was still traveling I'd get the 3G and subscribe to the NY Times but I can't read all of the news I want to (which isn't much) on my computer.
What I do like, is reading books on the Kindle. You can set up your machine with the font, font size, number of words per line, etc. etc. so that everything you read is the same in terms of those features.
You can shop for books at Amazon from your computer or from your Kindle using the Wi Fi or 3G system.
It's black and white, but that's OK with me.
It's small and light weight and very easy to use.
The leather cover with built in light is a really nice feature. The light works off of the Kindle battery, which lasts about a month and charges up in less than an hour.
Reading in bed, the light shines only on the Kindle page so it doesn't bother anyone else in bed with you.
I've got about 100 books on my Kindle right now. All of them I got free from either Amazon or Gutenberg. When you ""buy"" from Gutenberg or some other free source you just download the file (in Kindle format) and email it to a special email address you get which is then on Amazon.
Anytime you turn on your Kindle it automatically downloads whatever you've bought from Amazon or sent to Amazon from where you bought it.
It also does audio books and works the same way with those. However, you have to plug in earphones of course, to listen.
It holds 3500 books, so I've got plenty of room left.
Anyway, if you're interested in an ""eReader"" I can recommend the Kindle over the iPad2.
If you're interested in something with which to browse the web, I say, stick to a laptop.
I know Apple makes some beautiful products, but I think the iPad2 is a flop for what I wanted to use it for.
I think it's great for playing games on or looking at photos or maybe even watching a movie (after you've downloaded it) but I wouldn't want to try to watch a movie using ""streaming"" because of the networking issue."	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I have had this thing switched out 6 times at the apple store because there is always dead pixels on every screen, I mean the black pixels that are annoying, I guess apple is now trying to use cheaper products to save them money and rip us off.

I love the ipad and everything but this screen flaw thing is ridiculous."	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Honestly i feel like i got duped into buying the iPad 2 (I2). I loved the original iPad and felt Apple was really going to knock my socks off (and the onslaught of Android tablets) with it's new and improved tablet. To say the least i was completely underwhelmed.

The cameras may as well not even be there! The quality is aweful on both the front and the back. Apple made up for this by putting facetime software that is extremely sluggish on the I2! The main reason i got the I2 was to communicate with my wife and kids on facetime on her iPhone...

The new design (although impossibly thin and light) is very difficult to hold. The edges are kinda pointed  and its thinness leaves me feeling like it's going to slip out of my hands. The original I pad was one of the most ergonomically friendly devices ever made.

The performance (processor) isn't even noticeably different than the original. Don't try to comment and tell me ""well, the clock speed is actually blah, blah, blah..."" garbag! When I put it next to my wife's original and we load up the same apps and webpages its hardly different and in most cases no different. My wife laughed hard at me when i waiting ALL day for this dissapointing ""upgraded tablet"" and laughed even harder when hers performs just the same!

It's frustrating when you realize your favorite company hyped an inferior product this way. I'll NEVER walk away from Apple cause their quality is second to NONE. However, Apple lost this customer for good on tablets. I sold mine four days ago and got a Xoom WiFi and haven't put it down since."	2	electronics
B0013FRNKG	We had high expectations when we first got our iPad. Right now, it is the last gadget in demand of the family, firmly behind a toshiba notebook, a kindle, and android phone. We mainly use it to surf the web. But without flash, it becomes quite annoying. I often have to switch to a pc to continue surfing for video and games etc. So we end up using it to play plants vs zombies or other game apps or surfing the web when the computer is taken. Even watching streaming movie on it is stressful, which requires holding the iPad compared with placing a notebook on a surface. Then we realized that iPad is a fashion. It is not as good reading device as kindle because of the weight and LCD display. It is not as good as pc for many tasks requiring keyboard, storage and multitasking. It is slow. It could be a good surfing device if it supports flash. To prove my point, it takes me a great deal of effort to type this review. Try place the cursor by tapping on the touch screen.	2	electronics
