B0013FRNKG	Blurry picture and freezes often	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	You sent a micro usb charging cable for an Iphone or mini iPad it takes a big long thin one I had to buy the right cable but otherwise great device for the age	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Setting up my iTunes account on it took forever. Ive had an iPhone since the iPhone 4 in 2011 and this thing is super duper sllllloooowww and heavy you can tell its old and the cable it came with was a piece of crap you cant do a system update on it although its always trying and you can use newer apps its worth it if you just want it for Netflix for your kids but not much else	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I bought two and they started off really good but now they run so slow my kids don't want to play with them. The camera quality is horrible. Just save and buy a new ipad	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Worked great then screen started to go out at times	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	It works but I didn't receive a charger for it like it was promised an it has 16% when I got it  an its dinged up	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Works as advertised. Just an old iPad that is old to old to work and can't be updated due to apple dosent support.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Arrived faster than expected and the iPad itself was in excellent condition! However, the charger that came with it was complete JUNK!! It didn't last 24 hours. Be prepared to buy another charger for this. Seriously the most generic, cheaply made, charger one could find!	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"23 May 2017

I Am Having Trouble With The Power Cord That Charges The Battery Of This iPad.  I Can See The Wires That Are Outside Of The Exterior Part Of The Cord.  How Can We Purchase Another Cord?  If You Read This, Please Let Us Know How To Buy A New One.

Also, This Device Is Quite Slow; And, It Is Always ""Freezing"" Up!  I, Hope To Hear From You Very Soon.  Thank You.

Respectfully:

B0013FRNKG	Apps keep shutting down	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Very slow.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Beware its an Ipad 2, which means its the old style plug and it does not work with the newer Bluetooth products. You get what yo pay for.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I ordered 2. One of the ipads chargers does not charge.

Outside of this, the iPads arrived in great condition"	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	THE CHARGER IS MISSING	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	stopped working after a few months	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Love the iPad works great. However it did not come with a charger or anything. Therefore, I had to go out and by one before the iPad was even able to be programmed.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	just started using it. it makes dial sound even when mute. screen touch doesn't respond at times. not sure if it is defective or perhaps website problem??? not sure at this time. i'll play with it a little longer and update this review later.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	It was okay but it did not come with a charger and the charging system was also faulty so i spent extra cash to fix it. Also there were scratches at  the edge of the machine.  Thanks	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I am a bit disappointed.  The home button is slow reacting or doesn't respond at all.  I am not sure if it said this in the description, but apparently I did not see this if it was posted.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This item was great no complaints the they look new like never used	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Thank you	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	We are having problems getting some programs to work on this I-pad	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Our previous ipad 2 seemed to be faster opening apps and websites. The touch screen on the new ipadis not as sensitive as the previous ipad.  Overall not totally satisfied.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The iPad arrived in timely a manner and was undamaged. After charging, it came to life. The only draw back is that it came with NO owners manual. Weak!	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The tablets were in working order however they had bad scratches on the back of them. Other than that I am satisfide	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Had a tough time setting it up.
Supplier responded quickly
Could not resolve issues
Unit could not access WiFi
Returned for credit"	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I cant add my apps from my phone tiny beans with all my granddaughters pictures I or my gallery full of all my pictures. Also need to try out the camera just got internet yesterday 12-9-16	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I bought this product in July 2015 and it broke a few days ago (12/1/2016). It's used mostly to run an app for my job, so no intensive use. Last Thursday I tried to bring it up and got nothing, just a black screen. After a few hours of research my husband figured out that the iPad itself was working but the display wasn't. He said it was the ""backlight"". He found a few articles on the web that suggest to give the iPad a slap on the backside, each time he did the screen would light up...He decided to drop the iPad flat on its back on the carpet from about 4'...The Apple logo came up and the iPad has been working fine since.
So yes a pretty good product when it worked but rather flaky IMO."	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	For the most part, the iPad performs as expected.  I am having an issue with one of the games: it cuts out every time.  Don't know the reason but I haven't had the time yet to call the experts and do some troubleshooting.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Would not hold a charge and it took all night to charge to 100%  I bought two of these and so far the other one is ok.  I am returning the defective one and will see how that process goes.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	It works fine except for it's inability to access the 3G SIM card.  I had to go out and buy a portable hotspot from Verizon.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Froze up and then I got it unlocked
So far so good"	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	little memory, can't do to much, music shuts it down	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"well, this doesn't use a lightning usb connection, it has an old skool one, it gets kind of stuck when you plug it in, this i presumably bought new but it seems refurbished, only came 3% charged. It takes longer to charge it from 0% - 100% then it does to play with it. I think it took at least 6 hours to fully charge from 0% and then after 3 hours of using it, it was out of power already. I really wish I could afford  an ipad pro but i guess i'll wait another 5 years for that one to be discontinued and thus price drop.

update:9-6-16 After using this for a while and purchasing new chargers and more powerful adapters, the fastest I could get this to charge is 10% per hour. Sooo...that means 10 hours to fully charge from 0%. Seems ridiculous."	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I bought one last month and commend Apple for producing a computer that is a work of art in every sense of the word.  I strongly advise the consumer, however, against buying one from Sprint: The computer isn't WiFi-connected and is only 3G; as such pages are slow to load, and videos tend to stall.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This is an okay purchase.  Sometimes the ipad gets hung up and I have to close everything and start all over again.  The storage is the reason I purchased this used ipad, and it works great for that purpose.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"This was a fine tablet in its day (and I still own and use one), but please note that most of the best reviews were written several years ago. While this is still a ""current"" model in Apple's inventory, its low resolution and pokey processor render it virtually obsolete. If you can find one for around $200, it's worth a try. Otherwise, go for something newer and swifter."	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	did not have correct charger	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	It was great except for the fact it came with the wrong charger. I replied to the seller Monday and haven't heard back yet. Otherwise it works as expected.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	First ipad. Didn't realize how non user friendly apples are. I don't want to use i tunes. Very confusing. I'd like to just drag and drop files to my device. Wouldn't that be easiest.  Passwords are a nuisance everytime i want to down load app. Even free app. And no swipe keyboard, really? I loaded it with toddler videos and gave it to my kids. I'm going to get something else.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Received ipad and within a couple of weeks, the thing started leaving the app I was using when touched the screen. Sometimes freezes. Seller said was in great shape! I don't think it was rested.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	For the price it's fine!	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Both Chargers were defective. Neither works!!!!  Trying to reach company for replacement.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Not sure if the product or the operator is the problem. When I start to page down on some pages the page keeps resetting itself.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Its working okay. Working a little slow. What can i do to improve it. Can you help me.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The ipad 2 works ok but it crashes too much luckily im patient person because someone else might have sent it back.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"A friend bought my wife an iPad 2 as a present. I was amazed at how skinny this thing is - but there is a downside to this as well. First the good: light weight, skinny, and we opted for the wifi only model so we wouldn't worry about a monthly cell bill. My wife had a korean chat/email/talk program put on it, and she enjoyed that function of it. The camera function was also fairly neat, especially when she figured out how to zoom in and out of the pictures.

The downsides: the skinny construction makes this very fragile when dropped. The first time, we thought it was broken forever, (just a black screen, and wouldn't turn on) before I looked online and found a fix: place it face down on the floor and kneel on the back of it. The second time, the screen was a grainy pixeled red. tapping it on the back changed the red to green, and then went black. So it is apparent that one or more cables or chips are knocked loose inside.

The skinny size also has a second downside - you have to hold it somehow, and if you grip it around the edge of the screen, you can keep the touch screen from working properly if you don't notice your thumb touching the glass front. And of course if you just rest it in the palm of your hand, it is prone to dropping. It also has a nice yet annoying feature of auto-rotating the screen depending on its orientation - I ended up having to turn this off so my wife wouldn't throw it through the wall.

Apps are installed through the official Apple app store, which pretty much requires you to setup an Itunes account, so you lose a bit of your privacy there, and you are limited to what Apple decides you can put on your iPad, unless there is some secret way to root the thing.

All in all,the iPad 2 turned out tt be a mixed bag - looks beautiful, with lots of neat apps to keep you busy, but darkness lies beneath the surface. For official repairs at an authorized dealer you can also expect to pay between half of the original price and the full price - lovely. Throw in the limited competition forced by the app store and the erosion of your privacy, and the design itself pretty much guarantees the average consumer will be throwing additional money towards repairs."	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	the older models are much slower	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Easy to use	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	glitchy	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	cheap screen material	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Works a little slow but may just need to be updated	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I received the tablet in a timely fashion. It has been really great and I enjoy it. My only complaint is that I have a hard time getting the charger in and for the pad to recognize that it is in and charge. Sometimes I have to plug it in 3-5 times to get it to start charging. Other than that I love it.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The iPad 2 was fine (purchased so my 91 year old father could easily do FaceTime), but not as described.  It said that it was running OS7 (necessary for synching with my father's older computer) but instead it was running 9.2, thus no synching was possible.  Also, no cable was included (fortunately we had a spare), and the plug broke off of the charger the first time we pulled it out of the socket (again, we had a spare).  Hopefully the iPad itself will last longer!	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	While I am very pleased with the condition of this iPad, I am disappointed that it is so slow and seems to 'pause' before every action.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Caution is advised it is was not in fact a new iPad2 but one that was purchased as an end of model life-cycle or close out item.  It came nicely packaged but lacking an important element, the SIM card.  Other then these immediate observation it is in fact a much older model of the Apple iPad and will fill my need for a travel easy tablet.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	No instructions	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This pad was made for Cellular service. So every time you boot up it says NO SIM. It seems to run slower than my other pad and I'm not sure if this is the reason why.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Internet speed is a little slow And there are some glitches	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	screen size is too small for watching videos/live sports.  not as fast as i was expecting.  still useful but not great	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The device is working well - although one button does not. All in all, I'm very happy with it.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	thank you	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Came packaged very securely. I did notice a small scratch on the screen but works great	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The. Volume button does not work, but so far everything else is fine.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Like IPAD. Easy to navigate. Holds charge well. But Slow to charge and slow processing speed.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I have returned this item. Nothing wrong, jest not what I was looking for.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Not responding as expected to touch	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	For some reason, this iPad 2 doesn't have Siri (my other one does) and the processor seems to get bogged down rather easily. Not great, just OK.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I love my ipad for its size and convenience but since I purchased it updated to ios 9 it has me reconsidering. It constantly crashes and doesn't respond fast at all to typing. It's very laggy. From everything I read I believe its so laggy because the update. I was hoping apple would fix the problem but no ios update has. This leads me to believe apple wants everyone to go out and  purchase there new products. There older models will not function properly because they are older and less. I would give this product 2 1/2 stars but that isn't an option.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Slow to charge, so a low rating from me, because that is important.  Can't use it remotely, if it's not charge.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I was stoked to buy this at such a great price and when I received it I was told there was some wear and tear issues like scratches none were on it so I was so stoked however I noticed it took hours to charge.. hours... not normal. I wanted a partial refund and only got $25 bucks lol when it does finally charge the charge holds fairly well however I shouldn't have to wait 4 hours for it to be 100%	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	It good but thought it was a year old not from 2013.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	gave it to our relatives	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The IPad was in good condition  but the touch screen was getting glitchy. It would randomly click on things like carzy! But it was a used tablet.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The charger cable does not work	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Wifi software was very weak. Literally have to be 10 feet or closer to wifi modem to get service.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I was happy with the I Pad with one exception.  I was sent a faulty plug and it would not charge.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	it's okay	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I am happy with my iPad,  and I would have given five stars, except for the  charger was visibly, and obviously not working. I had to buy a new one so I was able to use it.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The microphone is completely broken :/ I even bought a external mic to plug into the headphone jack and still nothing.  Defiantly not the worst thing but really disappointing since I bought the iPad for school and would have liked to record my lectures and videos with no sound make the camera useless for face time. That's what you get when you buy used I guess.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I expected it to have flash on the camera which it doesn't have	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Item arrived on time, had some scratches but all in all, works.
I have noticed 2 random restarts, watching, will update later"	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I was really upset that you pay over 300.00 for a item and it didn't come with a users manual.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Ordered and received a brand new Apple iPad.  We could not set it up, called the Apple Store and was advised that even though it is brand new, the tech. is three years old.  The iPad had to be hooked up to a computer and revised.  Had I known this I never would have purchased it.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Too slow -- my mistake. Should have gone for an IPAD4	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Good afternoon I bought a used Ipad 2 and I can not use. Because It locked. Bar code is. X000OJ721D	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Product is great recieved the wrong charger and pd for 1 day delivery and recieved it in 4 days	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Charging port was a little out of alignment.  I sent it to my mother-in-law and she couldn't get the charger to plug in.  I can with some effort.  It other wise works ok.  This iPad was in ""ok"" condition, and I can make it work.  Wasn't in good enough condition to send to somebody who may not be inclined to investigate issues."	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Having some issues with it, it keeps going back to home screen on certain apps  like new cosmetically as stated	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	It works ok, had to find secrets to get it to a little better	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	External speaker isn't working	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The edges of the iPad are pretty banged up, but other than that, it's in good condition and hasn't gave me much of a problem	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Having trouble with the port.  Difficult toake connection in order to charge.  Will contact the company in hopes they will resolve this issue.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Tablet freezes a lot! Not sure about the memory usage.....seems to be full with under 5 apps.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"It was as expected; clean and in good overall condition. However this is my third iPad and I am having a great deal of difficulty getting online,  so sadly I am hardly using it. I don't know if it's the iPad or not but I have not had these issues with my last 2 iPads. :(
I probably should call and try to exchange it but I think it's passed the time frame .
Francoise
Incidentally I meant to give it two stars instead of 3"	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	It seems I can't load the more recent software to get it to work properly with the newer, (and much more expensive Square Stand). Its a decent tablet but for my needs its been glitchy with the stand.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I use it almost every day but I don't see what the  big deal is about owning a iPad. I glad I bought a refurbished one instead of a new one it just it's that exciting. I like my Kindle Fire HD just as much and I bought that new for about the same price.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The touchpad doesn't seem to work all that great, especially when I want to open a link in a new tab. It also just goes off by itself for no reason right in the middle of me doing something! It makes me wonder if this thing is used!	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The iPad itself is in perfect working order. However, the charger supplied by the seller was non-Apple for use on iPhones and not up to specifications for iPads. The cable was likewise non-Apple. Even after purchasing a 12W charger we also found that the cable was likewise insufficient. Finally, after purchasing both a genuine Apple cable and charger the iPad finally was able to be charged.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Has problems picking up wifi close and long range	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Didn't seem like tablet was professionally refurbished.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Item seems to work ok. I wasn't aware that the iPad was chipped on the side. If I had known, I probably would not have ordered it since it was a gift.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	ipad works great but I was surprised that the charging cord did not come with it.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Have taken this to Apple many times because the IPad shuts down periodically.  They have never been able to fix iy	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Bought for someone else. Yes it was used but wished it would have stated that it had Scratches on the back part, and some small scratches in the front.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Good but after a month it just stopped working had to pay almost 200 $ to fix not with the money from this place it was great until then	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Glitches a lot.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	it's ok till now	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"the product is very good i like it
My daughter like the ipad i have no compliants"	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	It's OK for simple tasks. Resolution has been improved since this iPad iteration.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Not a good product	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The item met  and exceeded my expectations.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The iPad was probably excellent, but it was stolen after having it for only two weeks.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Constantly disconnects from wi-fi... Even if it's in the same room as the wireless router.  Wife's iPad mini and both of our iPhone 5's do not suffer from this same problem.  Have tried troubleshooting SEVERAL times with various solutions online and nothing seems to fix it.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"This arrived on time but looks like a hamster chewed the aluminum casing all the way around with breaks in the edges. The screen has blemished areas as well. It has MUCH more than minor wear, it has clearly been pried open or something, and not neatly. I have a first generation Ipad I am replacing with this and it is older and has no signs of wear. No chewed up casing or blemishes in the screen so I expected the ""normal signs of wear"" to be similar to mine. This seems cosmetic and the screen issue isn't major, just some lighter areas."	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The corner was smashed, definitely not from shipping. You need to do a better job on describing your product. Absolutely, a buzz kill. Please inform your customers of damaged or chipped edges. Be honest and clear.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I bought 4 for anniversary presents for my family', there were more  scratches than I thought  there would be because of all the customer comments saying how perfect theirs were. Two of the charger cords were sticky and make a high pitched noise when charging. Also not sure if any warranty is available ? Over all good product, sent fast , work good.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Good as expected	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I order a white iPad yet I received a gray/black one. Disappointed that the color wasn't right but the actual iPad works	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Lock pad not working fully, could of made 5 stars but there was that issue.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	too many bubbles	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Missing the iPad case	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I've had my iPad 2 (this is my second one by the way) for a while (maybe 2 years?). Anyways, I was surprisingly a little disappointed. This isn't Apple's greatest product, that's for sure. Its slow, constantly crashes, and it pretty much useless. Also, you may think 16 GB is enough space, but even if you have an abundance of cloud storage or don't plan on storing much on the device, I can assure you that you'd be wise to get an iPad with more than just 16 GB. Its truly not as much as you'd think. I keep very, very little on the device, as I store nearly everything in the cloud, and I don't ever take/store photos on this iPad, but even so, I'm constantly having to delete things in order to install the latest update. This is incredibly inconvenient and so annoying!	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I love my Ipad but I've got a big gripe with a company who doesn't support it's older models at all.  The apps are slowly failing and can't be updated.  Deleting them one by one as they are no longer able to be used is frustrating.  I have always owned all Apple products but now I'm ready to branch out to less expensive products.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	It was more scratch that usual.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	It good but it's hard to see videos on it even when downloaded with the song.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	SO far we had no problems - but there were no original box or any instruction, k	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Would not play some videos	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Depending on what you do with your iPad depends on how you will like it. Apple has the best selection of apps. The iPad itself works just find. I am having trouble with the iTunes site in talking to my iPad. Apple wants to charge a fee for customer service. Best results are downloading apps onto the iPad with WiFi. Also, reading/using the iPad is limited to indoors. Trying to use it outdoors in the sun in next to impossible.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	When I received this ipad it was already set up and turned on with another's info. (Probably former user) the screen was popped off on the corners and duck tapped on the sides. It works very well actually connects great to my wifi and downloads all my games etc but now with the loose side of my screen an ant got stuck inside of it and freaking out I squished it. So now the remains of a dead ant is stuck in my screen with no way of getting it out without taking the whole screen off all because of the popped off loose side.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Bought it for my sister as a gift.  She loves it.  Easy to use, takes great photos.  Great picture quality when watching videos.  Would recommend.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I was very excited to get my new iPad, I would be using it for school and for my personal schedule. When I got the iPad it took a bit longer to charge but once it charged everything was fine. But when I tried to set it up it wouldn't detect any wifi even though I had a connection on all my other devices like my iPod and laptop.
Even at school, where wifi was throughout the whole campus, I was having a hard time detecting wifi. I finally got it but I had to hold my iPad very still and it had a one bar connection even though my classmates, who had surfaces, latptops and iPads, had three bars.
Finally I was able to get wifi connection at my home, however I has to be within 3 yds of the router on the other side of the house which was a little inconvienent for my but I was still able to get my work done so i wasn't complaining too much.

I had tried factory resets, turning it off-waiting- then turning it back on, letting it die on its own, and I even took it into the Apple store; where they did their own reset. And nothing worked. I believe, and the apple workers also thought, that the attenta may have been burnt out, however there's nothing they can do.

I enjoy my iPad, besides having to be very close to the router to get any real work done that requires internet access, everything works great! I'm happy with my purchase but just frustrated with this error."	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	We got this unit because of a particular application need as a sound mixer for PA system. It works okay.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This iPad looks quite used, but functions well.  The criticism we have it in the actual turnaround of the purchase.  It took 2 wks for the payment to go thru and for it to be shipped.  It took 3 weeks for it to arrive!!  We purchase alot of things online at many different stores, but it never takes that long to process and ship!	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I love the iPad with one exception.  The whole thing works very well but they put a very cheap screen on it.  Today I knocked it off a table that is 17 inches high and the screen cracked.  Whatever it's made of is more delicate than glasses that have fallen off the table or other plastic screens on phones that have fallen farther.  I know someone else who had the screen crack.  So, I got a good 2 1/2 months out of it.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I got this for my wife and she loves it, however it is not a computer, it is only good for games and e-mail.  If you want a little computer look somewere else, this does not have any expansion ports and only work with the Apple stuff.  I only speak PC so the Apple is strange to me.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Able to push iOS 7 with A little lag with minimum stuttering. But this lag is very noticeable. Screen is low res compared to other newer iPads but that is to be expected at this price point. Still runs better then the android competitors.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	When I received the item, it was dirty. Like food smudges and stuff. The cord to charge with was all dirty and the wall plug was broken!	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I got my Ipad delivery very very fast, like a Jimmy Johns almost and that is always a plus :) The screen was recently replaced so the edges reflected it and I thought it was going to come apart but one of my technicians I work with looked at it and said it should be alright but it had clearly been damaged before. It works ok other than the obvious repair and replacement of the screen. I'm pleased I suppose but I wouldn't have said it is in excellent mint condition. Thank you	3	electronics

B0013FRNKG	Bc when iam charging the ipad it kind take long to charge wich mean I used diffrent charges to.make sure not from the charge	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The iPad work fine the only thing I didn't like about it ,it's damage on the side. I got my brother a iPad to from epicmobile  for a less price then this and it look brand new . Also I was looking over all the picture before I order it and it look good but when I get it the side was damage but the seller didn't tell me it was damage on the side. I pay $300 dollar for this and I pay 275 for my brother iPad and it look brand new for a lower price.regret buying it !!!!!	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"However, the ad had errors in it: stating there were headphones and the wrong charger was sent (one for a phone, not the Ipad).
The ad also didn't specify that the cover was purple. Since this was a Christmas gift for my elderly father, it was fine, but it turned out to be a hassle communicating back and forth about the wrong charger that was sent AND I probably wouldn't have purchased this had I known it had a purple cover."	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Everyone said, you must get the iPad! So I did. I figured it would be easy breezy to use, but not so. Had to figure out complicated downloads from computer to cloud to iPad. Apple Store not the greatest either. I haven't used this in a long time because it is not that useful to me and for some reason am not able to work on Word docs the way a lot of my friends can. Perhaps it's just me, so take this review with a grain of salt.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	First unit that was sent didn't fiction properly. They did replace it promptly. The second unit worked great but had last owners information still on it. This was purchased for my mother and she isn't technically savy, so she was unable to use it right away and needed help from someone else. Over all I am pleased with service but would have liked it go a bit smoother.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I got mine refurbished, which is what i paid for ... so it's what I get I guess. I works alright, but my complaint is that the screen is separating from the body, so I have to really pay attention to that and ghetto rig it to keep it from peeling away (which is an extensive way of saying I use duct tape).

Anyway, not terrible, but not great. Maybe buy one and tell them you don't want yours falling apart on you."	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I didn't realize I need more memory for what I do.  combined with my iphone and Kindle, I really don't need the ipad.  I am considering re-selling it.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The volume button does not work properly.  I emailed the seller but heard nothing back.  So I guess I will use it like it is. Otherwise it is great.  I do wish that button worked.  It has a mind of its own and just increases and decreases at random. I use my pad all day so its hard to send it back and wait on a replacement so I just live with it.	3	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"If you live in the US as I do, be careful about purchasing iPads from this company.  I have been searching for FACETIME application and it is NOT on this IPAD 2.

I have been told that this IPAD 2 was probably manufactured for sale in UAE or other middle eastern country and Apple does not include FaceTime on these products.

ALSO, IT CANNOT be down loaded after market."	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I bought this iPad as new, but learned when I received it that while it had a charger, it was not the one shipped from Apple, and there was only 40 days left of its 2 year warranty. It did not work, so we took it to the Apple store and they replaced it with a used iPad that at least had a 90 day warranty. The seller says he would have replaced it too, but does not think warranty is important to most folks. To his credit, he gave me the requested refund so I only paid for a used iPad.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The iPad works fine however the power cord was half functional when it came and is hardly functional now.  I feel scammed because I should have a decent power cord.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I ordered this particular model because I lost the one I received as a gift.  I don't want the person who gave it to me to find out about the loss.  Also, I cannot afford a new one from Apple.  I chose the vendor Sikksound because of the positive reviews.  I am conditionally pleased with my choice.  The iPad I received was in pristine condition, with an Apple box, charging cord and fast charge plug.  It also came with a textured protective backing.  I discovered that the iPad had been used in Italy because of the formatting and information I found in the settings.  After a series of very courteous and helpful e-mail conversations with Sikksound, I was able to resolve the formatting issues.

However, I warn purchasers of used AT&T iPads of an expensive and cumbersome complication.  AT&T uses a SIM card to enable cellular data usage.  When sold by Apple, a new AT&T iPad comes with a SIM card which allows for periodic data usage.  In other words, a cellular data plan may be purchased through the iPad for a month, and then cancelled.  When cellular data is needed again, one can simply by more data for that month, and so on.  Because of it's Italian heritage the iPad I received was equipped with a SIM card incompatible with AT&T in the U.S.  In order for the iPad to use cellular data, a new AT&T SIM card was required.  A local AT&T store installed one without alerting me to the $36 fee, and without explaining that the monthly data plan must be ongoing, or the SIM card is deactivated.  A replacement SIM card from AT&T is not renewable, like the one which comes in a new iPad from Apple.  The AT&T store rep deactivated the SIM card within a few minutes after explaining that the data plan must be ongoing.  I only discovered the $36 charge when my bill arrived.  Luckily AT&T removed it because I had not used any data.

I rarely use cellular data because wi-if is so accessible.  However, for those who want to use occasionally use the cellular capability, you might want to do some more research.  I recommend spending time on the phone with, or visiting an Apple store, to find out your cellular data options."	3	electronics

B0013FRNKG	Tablet was delivered on time... good condition with only a slight scratch on screen. Tablet works fine except the WiFi range seems to be limited. Will only connect with my router up to about 25 ft. Other devices in my house seem to connect several rooms away. Will probably have to return the ipad if I can't solve the WiFi issue. Would have rated 4 stars except for WiFi range.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I love my IPad but the cord that came with it doesn't work!!! Sucks I have to buy a new one!!!	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Bought it used and spent hours on line with Apple to discover that the operating system had not been updated. Therefore I could not receive/send email or use the internet. A more computer saavy person than I might have caught onto the problem faster than I did, but with no Apple experience, I was pretty lost. So buying a used tablet with no literature wasn't ideal for me.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	As long as you know how limited the iPad is, going in (compared with competing devices with full operating systems),  then you probably won't be sad. You won't miss Flash or the ability to manage your files or be productive with any ease. If you just want iTunes, some games, and some Internet surfing, the iPad is great, but if you want all of that plus something fully operational, you'll need to buy a competitor's brand. The iPad is pretty, though--which is what Apple does best. My husband and I have 2.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Bought the item used.

Has a scratch on the front by the ""menu"" button that was not listed on the sellers description.

Also, after initial use, I noticed that it is terribly slow and when I went to check my emails ""multiple accounts"" it entire screen started to flash and the iPad froze. :(

I guess that's what I get for buying a used iPad. :( Just messaged the seller to try to figure out the issue.

Disappointed that the seller failed to mention these issues. :( Happy with the fast shipping though...."	3	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"Perhaps I just got a bad unit, but my iPad 2 has crummy WiFi reception.  If I get more than 20 feet from the access point, the connection randomly drops out.

I've heard others complain about this as well, but your results may vary. Just keep in mind that other tablets have multiple antennas to avoid this issue."	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Just limited. I can efficiently: Check email, surf the Internet, and play games. I can inefficiently: Edit Word documents and retain the formatting for the document.

B0013FRNKG	apple wants to lync all your apple devices. instead they should concentrate on the ipad being setup as a stand alone device. Had to have customer support just to set it up.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I wish I would have gotten a newer model. I pretty much have given up on this thing, so many apps that I would like to have don't work because it's outdated. I love the iPad in general and still plan to keep it for a while, but it's functionality leaves a lot to be desired. The NPR app works perfectly which is really great, and I mostly just use it for portfolio purposes and if I don't feel like carrying around a bulky laptop. Please listen to folks who tell you that this is not a replacement for a laptop, they are not lying. Seriously. Don't get rid of your damn laptop.	3	electronics

B0013FRNKG	The Ipad2 is generally well responsive and quick however there are a few malfuctions/weak points where it could of been made better. I test out tablets/ e-readers because I need them for school/coursework however The Apple Ipad has poor buisness apps and tools. The notes apps are very basic and less focused on. Apple mainly foucuses on its apps and games which attract the younger population. For example it has more Angry Birds Apps then your fingers on your hand! Some strong points are the Facebook app, Facetime(Similar to Skype) and Itunes. Not my taste of tablet and I will be selling it soon.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	i got this ipad for my birthday and i love it it is amazing it does just about everthing i want but it does not come with a user guide you have to download that yourself otherwise i reccomend it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The iPad s the best thing ever invented and I love everything about it. I bought it used to save money but just wish I was told that it had been dropped and had a lot of scratches on it. I found the dint on the bottom side and just hope that does not affect the iPad, so far so good. I also wish that I was told about all the scratches on the back, this is ok because I bought a case to cover it but I think when you spend a lot of money on something even if its used that the buyer should be notified of all the flaws before hand. I thought I would be able to  download Microsoft Office and I can not so I had to download a app and pay $10 so I can do my school work on it which is the main purpose I bought it.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I loved the iPad but when I approached apple with the purchase receipt and asked to add Apple care they said because the seller was considered the original owner I was declined. So I returned it and bought an I pad from Apple directly.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Product  came as was advertised.  Had tried to cancel, shipped within 8 hours which was ok.  Wanted to return, restocking fee to be charged was $61.18.  Will not do business with this merchant in future.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I swore up and down I'd NEVER purchase an apple product, including things on itunes and the like.  So far, I have upheld that promise.  However, from a recent car purchase, I managed to obtain an iPad 2 16GB as a promotion.  Since my girlfriend had one and I did want some experience with iOS, I figured I'd begin poking around with it rather than simply selling it.

The good...

iOS is very easy to use and extremely straight forward.  Everything is laid out nicely and always a flick-tap away.  And most all programs work very well with the unit.  Software tends to be clean without too many bugs.

Web browsing (just using Safari) is very smooth.  Most sites work well.  There's the ocational hiccup but it's more from using a touchscreen or the dreaded lack of Flash.  But soon enough, sites will probably migrate away from flash and on towards HTML5 (or simply pages designed for mobile/iPads).

Usability, such as typing is very straight forward.  The keyboard is well thought out and works much better than any I've used.  The touchscreen is very responsive too and multi-touch works without a problem.

Standby time is awesome and the unit is still functioning (IE gives you push notifications of Skype/AIM/etc)

Given the standpoint of say someone's who's very unfamiliar with technology or who doesn't care to spend time ""configuring things"", this works great.  However, that is not who I am...

The bad...

You are extremely limited.  Being closed source, some apps simply are not available as they would be for Android or Windows-based tablets (and I mean x86, not Windows 8 RT)  Finding ways to print can be impossible, certain formats may be unreadable, and even simple things such as adding attachments in gmail may be hindered without installing additional apps.

No Flash support!!!  As mentioned above, things are moving away from flash.  However, many sites still use flash there for some sites will not display correctly.  You are also limited on sites like Youtube, sometimes being unable to open the same videos you can open on a desktop environment (or even Android devices).

Where are my files?!  Stuff just downloads.  You have no choice where to put them.  Download something you don't want to share then start browsing the photos you took using the camera, SURPRISE!

Limited connectivity.  Expansion is limited to the propriatary apple plug on the bottom.  No OTG port, no standard USB, no microSD slot, no HDMI.  You can purchase some overpriced devices to give you these functions, but it would be nice to see some of them included.

---

All in all, it depends on the person whether or not one of these would fit your bill.  My girlfriend loves hers and almost never uses her PCs anymore.  For me, I'll grab mine for basic web surfing and the like, but if I'm doing much typing or any surfing that requires a fair bit of clicking, I still will grab a laptop over this."	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The iPad 2 that I received was in the co diction stated im when I ordered it. It had a couple bangs around the edges but the sleep/wake button in the too does not work but it's something I can get over. Other than that I am satisfied.	3	electronics

 Pienso que el producto se encuentra en mal estado, presenta multiples golpes en las esquinas y esta rayada por detras, ademas de presentar un rayon en la pantalla.

B0013FRNKG	This unit is generally an oversized ipod, I was told by many Mac lovers it does so much more, found out for me it doesn't. I will say it works flawlessly, great picture, not all apps work to full screen on it yet. I also own a Samsung galaxy tab 2, which I feel is way better for the money spent.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"First, I am tech savvy. I mainly use a PC. I have owned an iphone before. Don't use macs. This is my first ipad. It was given to me as a gift. I use android based phones.

My impression is that the ipad is very much like the iphone. Exactly the way you get into the phone you do the ipad. The icons are identical. So if you're coming from those other devices it's nice to have the same icons that you're already familiar with.

Overall I'm happy with the unit. My only real complaints are the camera, speakers, no siri and lack of microsd card slot. The camera is horrible. I was shocked to learn the mexapixel that comes stock on this device. I don't think it's even 1 megapixel but for taking pictures it's really bad. Very grainy. Video recording is in hd so when the video does come out the picture is good quality. But the camera pictures are horrible.

The speakers are mono. I'm not sure why they are mono on such a flagship device. They sound ok but i figured you would at least get stereo speakers with something that costs over $400.

Lack of microsd slot. Now this is really bad. iphones don't have them either. neither do their ipods. it's a great way for apple to make more money since you can't upgrade the storage capacity. Android tablets and phones I'm able to add up to 64gb of extra storage. So with this device I'm locked in to what storage I buy. That's apple's deal so take it or leave it.

No siri. Upgrading to os 6 I thought that I would at least get siri. No. Apple won't allow that. Kinda sad for their once top of the line tablet. Ok but not really a big deal. Just would have been a nice feature.

If I were in the market for a new tablet now, I would seriously consider the Samsung Note 10.1. It can do everything the new ipad can do and more."	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I bought IPad 2 as a gift for my wife.  We have 1st gen IPad that we got when Ipad came out first time.  Still works good with some lagging now days but it works good.  IPad 2 works pretty good but I just think there are so many better one out there now days with a lot cheaper price.  I love apple products but tablets pricing has gone down so much that IPad is just getting too expensive.  There are 10 inch tablet from Google Nexus 10 with better spec than latest Ipad and it's cheaper than Ipad 2 that I bought.  I see so many other companies such as Idolian with their Studio 10 that works better than IPad 2 and cost only $250.  Ii think Apple is great product but I think they need to get in the game with more reasonable price.  BTW, I'm returning this iPad and getting Studio 10 or Nexus 10.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I Like the ability and capabilities  of the ipad2. However 16gb was gobbled up by me real fast. In certain applications like fb or youtube etc. the touch ability was not very quick to response. They could have built in a usb connection to use with external hard drive for more space. Overall I like the ipad 2	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Being it as used,  The power button is quit hard to use.  NOT as touchy as it should be.  but its good...	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I believe I could have gotten this item for less money somewhere else but it was a very last minute purchase and now it is cracked and I never knew about an insurance policy I probably should have gotten but was never offered. My daughter is very upset and I do not know what can be done.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I can't rate the ipad yet because it came without a power cord so it is basically unusable.  But when I let Amazon know of my problem I received (as always) excellant customer service from Rajasekhar.  I work in customer service industry myself & know what good customer service is.  I am always pleased with Amazon service.  I am sure once I get a power cord I will like my ipad 2 very much.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The item came looking like new, but I soon realized the sound would shut off and had to be repaired.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	When we recieved it it did not work and we had to send it back in order to have it replaced. When we recieved what we thought would be a replacement it was the same one they just repaired what was wrong with the original one. They were very nice though and helped resolve the problem.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I ordered this as a Christmas gift and did receive it on time. But when it was opened on Christmas, it was not ""white"" like the product description stated.

B0013FRNKG	"This iPad was listed as being new.  It froze after less than 3 months and when sent to Apple for repair, I find out that I am the second owner.

B0013FRNKG	"I will be the first to admit - I am an android lover (it is such a cute little robot).  More importantly, I am also a techie, so it was inevitable that curiosity would eventually kill the cat (cat being the product loyalty).  When I decided that I wanted to see if iPads live up to the hype, I didn't want to go all out - I wasn't going to purchase a plan from a phone company that will overcharge me for limited data use - especially not when I can tether devices to my phone!  I also wasn't going to pay at least $100 more to get a retina display since I view it as unnecessary for me- certainly not worth the extra money (even if I do have an instinct to have the latest and greatest). I decided that the iPad2 16GB would be appropriate to base my decision!

The iPad is a good looking piece of hardware - but I would say that the software left me feeling limited in what I was able to do.

Pros:
-It's pretty - I do love a good looking piece of technology, and in that, the iPad does not disappoint
-I like the multitouch gestures

Cons:
-Heavy if you are reading in bed
-Edges around the screen mean that I have to stretch my thumbs that much further if I am trying to hold and manipulate the device with both hands (you can always cradle it in one arm and manipulate with the other, but it just feels odd no matter how you do it)
-No expandable memory - there are very few android tablets that do not offer this- get with the program apple
-the App Store was not user friendly and was stubborn when connectivity wasn't fast
-I find the settings app to be all over the place - settings for a single app may be in three different places (wouldn't it be nice to get into an individual app's settings from within that app)

Overall, if you are looking for something simple to use and don't want to be able to do anything too indepth the iPad is a perfectly adequate choice.  iOS is very straight forward, and generally user friendly as long as you don't want to change settings for them (ie you want to use default settings)- otherwise, you may have to go on a hunt for the exact setting you are looking for (if it even exists).  I have no plan to get rid of my iPad - it works in a pinch and if I am doing something that may be hazardous to my technology, I would bring my iPad, but ultimately, I still prefer my android tablets!"	3	electronics

B0013FRNKG	I found it heavy, larger than I preferred, and very slippery if not inside a leather holder. I did not like that I could not customize the home screen. I also did not like that several apps could not be removed. I sold it after about a month. I felt like I had to play Apple's game. I like android based operating systems better.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	It's not the router . Our laptop , and 2 iPhones work fine and pick up strong signals while the ipad 2 struggles to connect to networks even whilst sitting in front of a router . And it's not out router.. It's pretty much all wifi , whether my home, my parents or friends homes the thing struggles to get 1 bar . and as for 3G many times it says there's no SIM card detected . Doing much research I come to find out its a common issue with ipad 2 and Apple seems to not want to own up to this glitch .take it I. To apple and yes , they admit its a faulty antenna or wiring issue and its $250 to fix ( keep that in mind if you buy a refurb or pre owned w/o warranty )  I stumbled across an apple message board to a thread 130 pages deep of people all complaining the same issue . Just be aware that the ipad 2 when it does feel like working , is pretty great , but its temperamental and you'll never quite know if it will be a good day or a bad day with your ipad . The only temporary resolve is flipping it in and off airplane mode to stop it from freezing up, which I tend to do about 5 times a day . When it works , I love it .. Guess that's all I can say about that .	3	electronics

B0013FRNKG	Nice item, however it was overpriced based on comparative models.  Also the software was out of date and needed to be upgraded.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The bigger form of iPod, not seriously that useful... All these things are on iPhone too.. Over all design is good... The icons are too far at the screen..	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The iPad came in good shape, scratches on back as mentioned. But it was never mentioned that there was a scratch on the front screen. Its not too noticeable but I should have paid less considering that because others were the same price without this problem.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	So when I got the device it worked great, everything ran well. The programing was well done and it was prompt and timely upon it's arrival. But I am sad to report that after having it since the beginning of the year, about two months ago the screen went black, makes sounds but has yet to return to it's full function. I can't get anything to work and am highly disappointed that I spent so much money on the product and I don't have a product production.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I was very happy when i get my ipad 2 is the best of the best the only thing is the bad quality camera i don't know why such a expensive and revolutionary product from Apple has this bad quality cameras i get very dissapointed with this detail...!!! I compare this iPad 2 with my Asus Eee Pad slider  SL101 camera and the pictures are fantastic offcourse it has a 5mp so think abouted....	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I first got this ipad 2 because my computer broke. It functions well and I like it, but not as a computer. If you want a computer, get a computer, not an ipad. If you want to use the ipad for reading or playing apps or even watching movies, then this would work great for you. You can listen to music through it but it is so bulky I don't see how you are supposed to do so in comfort. It would have to be sitting next to you and you can't really carry it around and do stuff. If you want to listen to music get an ipod. The ipad is also very durible. I have dropped it many times and nothing is wrong with it. Thank you for taking your time to read this and I hope it helped you.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"What I like about this product: a high ratio of portability to usefulness, an excellent distraction for small children at restaurants.

What I don't like about it: websites look different and you have to re-learn how to do almost everything you'd normally do online.

Unfortunately, the availability of wireless internet anywhere you want just isn't there, so that greatly limits its usefulness for users who don't have wireless plans. For that reason alone, it isn't as convenient and useful as it could be. If you're already paying for wireless service, I'd say go for it, but if not, you might want to ask yourself if the other features it has would make it worth carrying around."	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I own a Nook Tablet, Kindle Fire and an ipad2.

I would have to guess that most of the people that rate the ipad2 5 stars have not tried other tablets,

Maybe you will like the ipad -- it has more apps in its store, but it also is slow compared to my Kindle Fire
and lacks the customization options of Android,

Apple products I have owned have malfunctioned after a few years (2 if my 4 itouchs')

Not having Flash Video is a major shortcoming -- most videos online are flash -- so you will be disappointed when videos
don't play.

Ipad does have a nice big screen, but no USB port, no memory card slot, average cameras and a VERY HIGH price.

I bought mine because of the hype and I was curious.

My advice is to check them all out before you buy - I would not have bought mine -- it is OK but over-rated with many shortcomings"	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Don't get me wrong.  I really like the iPad and most iProducts.  We own 4 iPods of different vintages and models.  The current nano is like magic.  (see Clarke's Law).  I just don't like Apple and their holier than thou and more superior than thou attitude about their products and operating systems.  Our household just got an iPad against my better judgement.  Seems one of us drank the Koolaide.  And as I suspected that person was in for a rude awakening when it came to making the iPad work and play well with others (the rest of the world that is android and windows based) and don't get me started about not supporting Flash.  So if all your friends and family are using iPhones and iPads you will have no problem communicating with them ( well not really) .  Apple has a chip on their shoulder about not invented here.  They have proprietary apps and programs that only work and play well with same ( AirPrint, FaceTime, etc) .  Brother for instance makes one of the most popular and economical mono laser printers in he world and AirPrint does not work with it.  You have to buy an app to be able to print from iPad to Brother products. Fail. Speaking of buying things, you will have to buy the smart cover and you will probably want the back smart cover and an a longer power cord and then a carrying case. Also with all things"" I "" you cannot add memory, no sd card slot but that's ok you can store things in the cloud.  I don't want to store things in the cloud.  Clouds invariably blow away or want to charge you rent. There's a lot of things to like and a lot of things not to like about the iPad as with any tablet I have seen.  You are paying a premium over the competition to join this club and the iPad is just not as tricked out with ports and interfaces to the real world as I would like.  Works well and makes users happy so there is somerthing to be said for that.  Can't imagine someone not being happy being given one as a gift."	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This ipad is nice but it still had all of the previous owners down loads on it and didn't come with a manuel and when requesting one they refered me to a web link and thats not what I asked for.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	When buying this I thought this had 3g but it didn't so all in all other than the additional camera that the Ipad 1 does not have I really don't see a whole lot of difference between the two.

A must have for some just not me I guess.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Beware if you already own an iPad 1 and are planning to upgrade. Apple is selling the iPad 2 with the newest OS 5. This iPad comes with OS 4 which means that if youve already upgraded your iPad 1 to OS 5, you cannot directly restore your iPad 1 to this iPad 2. If this is you, save lots of time by ordering directly from Apple.	3	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"The iPad is a wondeful fun device great for casual web browsing and such.  The interface is typical Apple excellence and the quality of the device seems quite good.

It most certainly is not a laptop replacement.  Two absolute killers are that you cannot run MS Office and printing anything is pretty much a joke.  Yes, there are applications that sort of kind of read and write Office files but they are very limited.  Printing can also be done as long as you get an application, save this way and that, stand on your head and hope for the best.  Again, it is fun and cool as all get-out but not a business machine."	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I have the iPad 2--as well as iPhone 4 and a Kindle Fire. The iPad is large and a little unwieldy. As an e-reader it's simply too big and heavy. I stopped using it once I got my Kindle Fire, which is great for my purposes. My wife uses the iPad for video Skype calls to her family, but she prefers to e-read on her own iPhone. Neither of us ever brought the ipad to work or anywhere else. The iPhones do the same work. I do bring my Kindle Fire on long trips, however.	3	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"My first iPad. Sad it could not be made in USA. The first one malfunctioned in less than 4 hours (sticky home button). Seller was very helpful and offered an exchange. Apple store wanted to give me a refurbished one right away. I purchased AppleCare extended warranty and support and Apple express shipped a replacement. YOU MUST BUY APPLECARE FOR THIS, so increase your purchase price by $80. The iPad is light and fast, has good battery life.
CONS does not do Flash, hey Apple, GET OVER IT! I cannot find a browser yet that supports ActiveX and emulates IE so I cannot remote to my work desktop.
Overall, a very light, fast and fun $900 TOY, not for serious productive work.  Such a pity."	3	electronics

Very few apps for business and personal finance. Forget The heralded Apple support, it vanished a few generations ago. iPad manual so basic to be of very little help. Forget printing unless you have an e-printer.

B0013FRNKG	I got this in June and loved it...for a while. This is one of those things that is WAY overrated just because it has an apple on the back. It isn't all that great. You could get a good Android tablet for half the price of this. Even if you simply MUST have Apple products in your home, don't get this. iPod Touch is the same thing but smaller, and iPhone 4 is the same thing except for the ability to call, text, and having a smaller screen, which isn't that much of a disadvantage. If you're gullible enough to still want an iPad 2, at least get the 3G model...maybe that's where I went wrong. I only gave the thing three stars because others might have completely different opinions than I do.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This is by far my favorite toy.  It's more usesr freindly and even more helpful for almost everything I want it for, except the portability issue since theiPod touch fits in your pocket but leaving that aside, it's really mobile, you can take it with you everywhere. This product has literally helped me get over my Ex. Ipad 2 is so much more than just a lareger ipod toch instrument.  People making such claims don't seem to have used one. I agree that because applications are similar and they both share the same iOS, the experience might not seem that different, but once you get your hands on it, the bigger screen, the dual core processor, larger memory and longer battery so I like it better.	3	electronics

However, iOS feels like training wheels and Honeycomb feels like the real deal.  Android is more like an actual computer while iOS feels like (and is) a giant phone.  I can do things like download Power Points directly to my device and open them using Docs To Go.  What good are 10,000 apps if they are all games?!  I have not discovered anything yet that my iPad colleagues in school can do that I cannot with the Xoom, but only Android has widgets, multiple desktops, Google integration, the list goes on and on...  Honeycomb is getting new apps everyday and you are free of Apple's restrictive environment.  Plus, Ice Cream Sandwich is going to polish off Android and take it to the next level.

B0013FRNKG	"iPad2 64G wifi model

Pros: Very good image, light, small, great battery life, almost the 10hrs they claim, not just 3-4. Great for games, internet, books. Contains a standard iPod in it which is nice. Screen is sturdy enough to handle the constant cleaning/wiping you have to do without scratching.
Cons: Locks/apps freeze up regularly, needs a power off recycle to fix. Very poor wifi, constantly disconnecting regardless of wifi source, have tried many locations. With button on top, volume button is backwards, right is lower volume, left is higher which is opposite of the scale that pops up to show the volume level.

Overall I spend more time getting it to work correctly than I do using it. It reminds of a circa 80s PC, maybe Windows 3.0 era. It is great for games, books, iPod because they are all internal. If it has to go externally to stream content, or send a message, etc that is when the problems develop.

People complain constantly that it does not have a USB port. This is good because endless problems would develop from the use of endless attached devices, just like on PCs. Apple wants it closed for a reason, so it will work.

Bottom line, it is a toy, great for games, music and not nearly reliable enough to use for anything more important or demanding real time continuous stability."	3	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"i bought this from apple because amazon didn't have it yet.  I am middle- aged, love my nano, a kindle devotee from the first days, don't have a smart phone, and am a pc user.  at first i was awed by the touchscreen and the resolution quality.  images are gorgeous.  but now, it is really annoying.  too often the screen doesn't respond, and then reacts when you don't even know you're touching it.  the word processing function has been limited and limiting from the start, for someone accustomed to microsoft.
if you think in buying the ipad you are getting a  compact, fast, light computer, you are not.  it IS fast.  a computer it is not.  no flash player is definitely a hinderance.  what it is great for is apps, games, (although the screen has been frustrating there too), watching movies and tv shows,  some browsing on the internet, and as a portable photo album, because images are truly fantastic on the ipad.  i find the screen very fatiguing on my eyes, and have the brightness level down almost as far as it can go.  i would never dream of reading a book on it.  kindle has nothing to worry about, as far as the ipad as a reading device.  the fact i can't see the ipad  screen outside, even in the shade, is also unfortunate, but i get it, that's a backlit screen.
i am submitting this review not to bash apple, but to clarify a bit to people not familiar with macs and/or touchscreens what this device is about.  would i buy this device again? not unless it sold for maybe $300.  it is more a toy than a tool."	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	It is very nice but lacks flash player, therefore it is not very useful as a browser. Plus: many applications and intuitive interface. Cons: no flash player, expensive applications, some applications lack basic functionality (like lists in Twitter).  The worst: Is not environmentally friendly and when the battery runs dead you have to throw it away.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Just bought a brand new 16GB iPad2 off Craigslist, and have some general comments...

I found it quite difficult to get set up, it seems you have to connect the iPad to a PC or Mac and go from there (you get no manual, just a stupid little card with minimal info on it), which meant lots of figuring things out. Just the iTunes image alone that first appears on the screen when turning it on for the first time makes you go ""huh?""  Maybe the Jr. High kids can blast through it, but it's harder for me (I'm 52) and I have a fair amount of computer experience.

You also have to input your credit card info! This means one thing...this machine is designed purposely to be a money hog for Apple and entertainment giants. It will have you buying all kinds of apps and music and entertainment to download from iTunes. Another step closer to being an automaton.

No USB port means Apple wants to control accessories and what you can input/output with the iPad, and that leaves you guessing, finding workarounds, and buying more stuff. But sure, it's also to minimize complications with external devices.

This machine is amazing, though, I got it for showing my work and upcoming interactive apps at conventions (I'm an artist). I can now carry around a portfolio of my work without the bulk. But to get photos on it properly you will have to buy an application for it. There are ways of getting photos uploaded without iTunes and buying photo apps (like emailing them to yourself and downloading them from there), but then the photo app it comes with leaves you without much capability to manipulate and organize them and put them in folders. There are literally no buttons/selections to control things with. This is obviously another manipulation to make you buy something more.

Lastly, if you want accessories (or even the iPad itself), go to Amazon or Craigslist, Ebay, friends, family--and buy them used, don't fork out $50 for a new protective cover, you can find a lot of these things used or cheaper than buying from Apple or manufacturers that don't care about the Earth and design products that end up too soon in the landfill.

Overall it's a cool machine, but like me, with the way corporations/manufacturers plan and manipulate your pocketbook you might one day start to realize you're just a cog in the money machine for these corporate entities.

Well, someone had to say it."	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I bought the iPad 2 wifi 16g to take with me to Afghanistan. When I first recieved it, it was amazing. It was new, flashy, fast, the charge lasted forever and all my friends wanted to play with it. After about a week or two, the battery didn't seem to stay charged as long. It wasn't that big of a problem though, because I was never far from a plug. When I got to Afghanistan is when I lost all respect for the iPad 2. The lack of constant signal caused apps and updates to half download which left permanent gliches in the programs and the main screen as well, that I cannot get rid of. Problems, that none of my friends with other brand's tablets had. The battery life was almost cut in half and its a hassle to do anything with it now because of the poor state of apps and the whole iPad itself. I would recommend this if you will always have perfect signal and never be more than 10 feet away from a plug.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"The iPad 2 really is a nice toy, but not more than that. I own the 32 GB WiFi version. For getting things done even a Netbook is a better choice and cost's a third. The keyboard and the connectivity with the ""real"" digital environment is really missing. For reading books the Kindle is way better. It's the perfect device for casual surfing. Casual fit's the device the best. If you like to read rather get a Kindle. When it's about work a PC or Mac is the better choice. The iPad kind of fill's the gap, if you already own any of the above devices, then it's often more convenient to use the iPad. Just be sure that you are ready the pay the premium for something you don't really need."	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Ok, my rating is a compromise, in terms of working exactly like its intended to it should be 4.5 stars or so, in terms of how it replaces things like a kindle, a smartphone or notebook, its maybe 1 star. I really wanted something that would allow me to ditch the laptop and use this on travel. Its not happening, functions are too poor, touch screen keyboard is not tactile enough to use for any real typing, Safari browser is cumbersome to use, can't read the screen in even normal daylight so doesn't replace my e reader at all. No real spreadsheet functions or presentation modes. Too clumsy to take noes on.  The only things it replaces laptop for are movies or videos and even then the battery life is pretty poor. As far as I can tell I really got sucked into buying one from the hype. On the other hand I use my smartphone (iPhone) constantly and it also replaced my mp3 for traveling. A case of a product making your life easier. I'm going to give the tablet to my daughter, I'm sure she will use it, but I haven't really found a useful role for it	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I've been using a Galaxy Tab with Android OS for the past 7 months and decided to jump on the iPad 2 bandwagon.

After a couple months of using it, here are my comments:

If you not an Android user, then I guess you may think the iPad 2 is great.

I can't say that I'm impressed with the fact that I have to reboot my iPad to resolve an intermittent issue of Safari hanging up, nor am I happy about having to give my credit card details to downloads ""free"" apps, I could go on, but maybe another time.

I like the fact that its much lighter and cheaper than a Galaxy tab; you have the option of not choosing the 3G feature which I seldom use.

Overall, its a nice tablet if you don't now what you're missing with Android. My advice would be to test other products before making a decision. I've now given my iPad 2 to my 5 year old and will continue to use my Galaxy tab."	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The ipad although cool is just a toy. It does not have the capability to be used for anything serious. This is not for professionals. I purchased it from bestbuy for my business. I run a 3d animation company. i wanted to use the thing for the simple task of storyborading. Lack of a good file mangagment system will cripple your workflow in this regard. I tried for two days straight downloading apps to try and justify the purchase and could not. I am returning this thing and investing in some software for my PC that will actually benefit my business. Technology wise it is savy, very impressive. But functionally from a professional stanpoint it is seriously lacking. Although the tablet boasts of thousands of APPs most of them are not suited for professional use. I am also a musician and couldnot find one darn APP that was useful for a serious musician. So from an Arts and media perspective this thing is a waste of money. IF you want something to play around with then by all means get it. However, if you are using it for work, Forget it!! Very dissapointed with the device...	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The supplier was very prompt in delivery, however I was never able to connect the unit to Verizon.  I suspect that this particular IPAD was one in the group that had a duplicate MEID number burned in during manufacture.  The defective unit was returned to Apple and a new unit was sent to me.  The new unit performed as advertised.  Replacing the IPAD took less than a week.  If you are going to use Verizon 3G, then I would recommend that the IPAD be purchased directly from your local Verizon shop.  This will insure that the unit is working properly before you pay.  The price is the same and you can set the account up where the billing is included in your cell phone account rather than through a separate account via Apple/Verizon.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The IPad 2 is a wonderful gadget.  The WiFi only 64Gb version sells for $699 on the Apple website.  I'm totally puzzled by seeing them for sale on Amazon and Ebay for MORE than the Apple retail price.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"At first this device was the best thing I had ever bought! Two weeks later I'm kind of disappointed.

I have had a couple of issues with this device, biggest one being serious issues with wifi connectivity. Apparently this has been a common issue for ipad 2. I found a fix for mine, which is to say its not complete junk, but definitely an inconvenience to go through all the steps again and again to fix it. The other issue is I keep having audio problems...sometimes when muted it cant unmute itself and I have to restart it in order to get my audio working again. The camera picture quality is not great, in fact its useless. The video quality is decent in good lighting, very usable if you can really see yourself taking video with a 10 inch tablet. The device isn't heavy for me, but my older mother found it heavy for her to hold after only using it for 5 minutes, which is why I would also recommend getting the smart cover for it..it can turn into some pretty useful sturdy positions for typing, reading, or watching video.

The positives of this device, I was surprised at how great the screen would be. I thought it would scratch easy or be high maintenance...but its been really easy to keep clean with a small microfiber cloth (not included). Apps load fast, graphics are nice, and perfect for netbook replacement as long as you don't do a ton of typing. Its great for social media and web browsing, but i would NOT use this as an ebook reader, your eyes start to hurt after reading for awhile. Get the kindle for that.

I think the app store is slightly over hyped, i have found two unique apps that i couldn't have got for an android tablet...but overall the most popular apps seem to be on both devices."	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	iPad2 might be useful while on the go, however I find it has limited utility and is not worth the price with almost all functionailities being available in good smartphones these days.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I really don't like technology for the sake of technology, and anything I buy I want it to have a specific purpose. I bought this IPAD for a specific reason, and following it's use for that purpose, I am trying to figure out what else this thing can do, and what it is good for. Sadly, the only thing I have found so far that made me smile was when I got to watch Family Guy on HULU while stuck in the Las Vegas Airport. So, all in all, I am unimpressed. Outside of the ""cool"" factor, I really don't understand the flurry of excitement over this technology. Service from Amazon was amazing and hopefully I will get something to use this for. If not, I guess I will give it to my daughter for use at her school that is now issuing them to students."	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"depends what each one is looking for, as this is pretty much an overgrown phone without the phone capabilities!!
If you are looking for a net/notebook replacement this is not the place for look, for sure.
the lack of flash support is not only annoying but seriously handicapping an already handicapped (hardware-wise) device
good for gaming for kids
good for accessing your emails fast, especially if your eyesight is not as strong as those crackberry users
web browsing is good and fast but .... that damn flash issue again.

Basically apple has repackaged an old solution into a glossy package with average hardware and sells it for gold, a feat which noone but apple can achieve and no less commendable since for the same money you can get 3 netbooks or one kickass notebook...
A word of advice to those guys queuing outside Apple stores to get this, guys relax, get a netbook, an extra battery and buy a nice gift to your girl/boyfriend with the rest of the money and you will feel better in the morning!"	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Okay, I have had this for 3 weeks now and I think I have seen enough of it to know it.

This is my first Apple product, and let me start by saying YUCK! I have now started calling it crApple. All they do it market this product as if it is the best thing in the world, but it is definitely not.

So why 3 stars.

Pros:
Yes there is some good stuff, but I do not know how unique it is to Apple. Size, weight and battery life is super. You can use it the whole day, and angry birds is seriously addictive. It remembers each network and its settings so that I do not have to manually change proxy settings everytime I move from office to another place.

Cons:
Everyone has said it but I'll say it again: No flash = No point! It is so annoying that you have to keep going from one applet to another to do things that you can normally do on a browser. Seriously, if you tube just decided to use flash and to remove their App I think Apple would go bankrupt.

Editing stuff is impossible or as difficult as doing it on your phone, with the exception of a larger keyboard. Speaking of the keyboard I cannot for the life of me understand why apple cannot put arrow keys on it! So annoying! Yes there is a magnifier which allows you to scroll the cursor but how tedious it is!

A lot of the other stuff has been mentioned in other reviews but these were teh maain points for me.

Also - a note for people considering a laptop or this - buy a laptop. This is the 3rd thing you need.

This is really ideal for someone who has a large heavy laptop which stays in one place and needs a lighter device to carry around for just brisk surfing, checking mail, watching some youtube and playing games (ie a bigger version of an iPhone).

However, if I knew what I know now I would never have bought this thing. I would wait until google improves Android or microsoft comes up with some hardware that will kick Apple of its perch, because there is nothing like a normal windows operating system. I need flash, I need to be able to open, edit and  attach my edited files to gmail through a browser. I need flash (yes I said it again). I also want to be able to download whatever software I like and run it, without it having to be a mobile App.

I think what has happened is that I made the mistake of thinking that the bigger screen meant that this was a real computer, rather than just another mobile device with all its limitation. So don;t buy this if you think you are getting a real computer. It is just a bigger version of a phone, and if it is not the 3G version it is just a rich mans toy."	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	It's kind of like having your own casino: there's always that chance that it will do what you want sometime. It hardly ever does, but I keep going back for more because of that chance. Also everyone else seems to love them. I suppose I will learn to like it too. So far it is a device that devours loads of time, and all for the purpose of making it work. If you want a new hobby of playing with a new device, this one is a doozy. If you want it to actually accomplish something useful, I'm skeptical after having it for a month. You can always call Apple for tech support, but my experience was that they were more interested in selling me more stuff. I don't see that that is my solution.	3	electronics

B0013FRNKG	The ipad2 I ordered from amazon came very quickly, a lot faster than they expected. It was a 32 gb. This was for my 68 year old sister-in-law who has not used a computer. After a few instructions, she was able to pick up and use it, using face time to talk to her son abroad, nephews and grand nephews across the state, skyping, emails etc. She wanted to store pictures in it so we bought a usb cable to attached an external portable hard drive, and lo and behold, it doesn't eve see it. Apparently, apple products are not expandable as I thought. (I used an android operating system from verizon). So she is stuck with pictures in her sd card. So I told her to just store the pictures in sd cards. SD cards are not that cheap though but I don't see an alternative. She does not have a laptop at all. This is my only gripe with the Ipad.	3	electronics

I can't really provide a product review, since I bought the ipad 2 on 5/11 as a graduation gift.  I did want to mention that I simply went to the Apple store in Freehold, NJ, and bought the device for $729 immediately without any problems.  Its the 32gb 3g Verizon config.

B0013FRNKG	Before you go jumping off into Hightech Hysteria, think about what you want to do with what you might be buying. It's almost worthwhile to consult someone who has an iPad or someone who can guide you to what would work best in you personal daily use. This is in most cases not going to replace a laptop, or a desktop computer. The size of the screen is really nice, but then you can't put it in a suit jacket pocket. Nice to have with you, Yes. Easy to leave laying somewhere, Yes. Work with major programs, such as Adobe or FileMaker, only in an emergency and only if the program exists for the iPad (up until now only some mini versions exist). Make sure what you want to primarily want to do, really exists, this i not Mac OS X, this is iOS 4.3. If staying online is that important AND you don't mind carrying it around (it's not heavy, but it's bulky), then you could consider this gadget. It's like a sports car, it's nice to have, but it's not a necessity. What would be nice is something between the iPad 2 and the iPhone / iPad Touch sized iPad mini, that would be half the screen size of the iPad 2. This way, it might not fit in all suit jacket pockets, but could be carried in a shoulder holster or similar carrier under the jacket, sweater or what have you. The larger size to accommodate the over 40 seeing problem and big finger dilemmas.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I got my iPad2 last weekend. I had ordered one from apple.com. I had to wait for close to 4 weeks. I didn't have an iPad before. It felt heavy for me to hold with one hand as an e-book reader(which was my primary motivation). After using the iPhone4(and a very happy user, I must say) with retina display, I found the display not very crisp and somewhat underwhelming.

Some of the iphone apps have different look and feel on the iPad2, gmail for instance. Overall, I was satisfied, till yesterday.

It fell from 2 feet from my son's hand on to the concrete garage floor, and the glass shattered. the Ipad2 works fine, it has a cracked screen. The touch functionality works, even over the cracked screen(an engineering marvel!)

I called apple support today, and they want $269 to replace the screen, that is more than 50 percent of the product.  An outrageous amount! Now I am stuck with this magical device!

How can they design such a fragile portable computer. Get some industrial grade aluminum with a cushion for the front. This glassware is no iPhone. Handle with extreme care!"	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Great unit, but be aware, the cameras, even the better, forward-facing one--really bite. Why they couldn't use the camera from the current iPhone, which is quite good, on this $500+ product, is beyond me. It is a huge flaw in an otherwise mostly outstanding beast.  On a more minor note, the Apple tendency to design for profit instead of ease of use is always maddening. Case in point:  The built in memory costs $100 for each additional 16GBs.  My (non-iPhone) phone has a removable mini SD card that cost $9 for 16 GB, and I can add memory at will, for very little money. This could easily have been the Apple approach with the iPhone & iPad. A mini SD is the size of a fingernail. So I still buy Apple products because they are so good in so many ways, but the affordability thing is kind of ridiculous. Their computers are better than PCs, no question, but should not cost fully twice to three times what a comparable PC costs.	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Really people? For the money this thing is stripped down. They just now add a forward and back facing camera and everyone is like ooh cool. This feature has been on cell phones forever. It should of been added on the original ipad. Think about it. A cell phone has more features than an ipad. Smartphones now have high resolution front and rear facing cameras with flash, able to use the flash as a flashlight, sd card slots, cable hook up to t.v's, wifi, usb, physical keypads, can download music without proprietary software, and so on. All in one little package. Now don't tell me they don't have room on an ipad to add any features.

Yes they made this a little lighter and a little faster. But for the price you can buy a powerful laptop or netbook that will leave the ipad 2 in the dust. And you won't have to pay for proprietary cables or accessories for dowloading your pictures, files, music etc. like the camera kit, which doesn't work for all cameras or memory cards to transfer pictures. And don't forget you have to pay for all the Mac apps. And oh you want a physical keyboard? More money. Wait you better buy a protective case to protect your new investment that probably is adding up to almost a grand now. That's where Apple gets you. You have to buy their proprietary products and services. And they will add features and memory upgrades a little at a time to newer models so you will want the latest features. Just like their ipods and itouches.

If you are thinking about replacing a computer with this, then read on. If not, then read elswhere.

All that said...if you want to do work on it, consider getting a loaded netbook which is a better value and more powerful, more memory and you don't have to go through the hassle of downloading or uploading to another computer like you would have with an ipad. With a netbook you can just load data onto an sd card or thumb drive if you want to instantly. What if you don't have a computer around with an ipad and you want to transfer some files or pictures onto it or want to just download some files and take it with you on a thumb drive. Oh wait did you remember to bring the cables or adapter with you on top of that? Do you want adapters protuding from your expensive ipad waiting to be bumped and snapped off? Also do you use Windows or Mac? Is your printer cabable of over the air printing? If not then you have to either get a capable printer or transfer the data onto a computer that is hooked up to your printer. If it were not for the touchscreen, would anyone buy an ipad? HECK NO! It would be considered a featurless outdated piece of equipment comparable to something about 10 plus years ago. See where i'm going here. But on the same note, a netbook is not as portable. So weigh out your wants and needs. I ended up getting a netbook after research and playing with them and no regrets because I can do anything on it and it is a spare because the kids take up the other computer. I couldn't of done much with the ipad except surf the web. Example, my wifes work computer crashed and she was working from home. Well luckily she had the netbook because she hooked up the netbook to her lcd monitor and logged into a computer at her work place remotely and kept on working. And I also had the netbook hooked up another time to my flatscreen, an external hard drive, mouse, and an sd card in the slot so I could edit pictures, back them up and print them. I also had an extra usb port to spare where I could of had a phone plugged in to charge at the same time my netbook was charging also. Couldn't of done all this with an ipad let alone charge it at the same time if you had something plugged into it's single proprietary port. Get at least an 11.6 inch netbook if you decide on one and still want functionality and portability. Everything fits on the screen better and not crammmed in. Keep in mind though that some netbooks come with just Windows starter and not a full working edition. If you don't get the full working edition, then the netbook would not be of much use. But oh when I just want to lounge around and surf the web, I wish I had a tablet. But I use my phone for that, lame but it works. Oh yeah, I can tether my phone to the netbook also.

Personally I think this is mainly usefull for surfing the web or used as an electronic organizer for someone on the move who has to keep track of a lot of information or carries a clipboard i.e. invoices, work orders, short note taking, etc. or needs visual images out in the field. But to use in place of a real computer, no. You can buy apps. for the ipad to do some work on, but they are not as powerful. So think about what you want or need it for. Ask yourself something like this. Do you need something portable for school where you can do term papers and homework on, or for organizing and socializing? This is not a replacement for a computer if that's what you want. It is a media device with limitations features wise. Also with a netbook you can have a spare battery and swap it out and continue on. With an ipad you have to plug it in and wait for it to charge and it defeats the purpose of mobility doesn't it? Yes you ipad defenders, I know the battery charge lasts pretty long, but there are variables affecting it like what you are running and what if you forgot to plug it in overnight and you don't have time to charge it.

I'm not saying a tablet doesn't have it's place because it does. And yes I know that an ipad and a netbook are two different things. But it may not serve your needs so be aware. I can see where an ipad or any other tablet would be more practical or even a no brainer because a clamshell design of a netbook might be just to clunky. I'm just pointing out the lack of features on the ipads. If they only would add a memory card slot or standard usb to make it simple to transfer data or so I can hook up other peripherals. I don't want to pull out cables or turn on my computer and sync it everytime I want to transfer data. But don't hold your breath. They want you to buy another one with more memory if you need more. A memory slot or usb would give you the option of adding more memory of your own. And it won't take you long to fill up the little memory the ipad offers if you like to load media onto it.

Size and price should be taken into consideration if you want to use it for entertainment away from home a lot. There are several tablets offered from competitors now and some are less expensive, more features, smaller and lighter and don't use a lot of proprietary cables or software applications or hardware, they have sd slots and or usb also. Something you might want to think about if you like to dowload or upload stuff on the fly and travel light. But it comes down to you to research ask questions and try to get some hands on to ""see what works best for you"". Just don't expect that all the tablets perform the same or offer the same apps. Your not going to get ipad performance or huge selection of apps. to choose from compared to a tablet that costs way less. If you just want it to take on vacation while relaxing next to the pool or to keep kids entertained then a less expensive tablet might fit your needs so you can still enjoy yourself and not have to worry as much about it getting stolen, lost, or broken. As for the ipad, you might be to concerned with it to enjoy yourself or it is just too big and a 7 inch tablet is more convienient. But if you want your cake and eat it too. Take a look at the Asus Transformer and Asus Slider. The transformer has a detatchable keyboard with a mouse pad and battery that extends your battery life, two sd slots, USB ports, and you can adjust the angle of the screen and close it like a netbook. The slider has a keyboard build into the tablet and screen flips up. No mousepad though. But there is a USB port that you can hook up a mouse to if you want. Also with the Asus tablets you can multitask and listen to something in the background while doing something else. With the ipad you can't. The Asus tablets support flash and you are able to watch clips on web pages, whereas the ipad you don't get to watch the clips because most clips are flash. The Asus tablets will fit movies on to the screen better and not have the black bars on the top like on the ipad. People are even getting rid of their ipads to get the Asus. There are also a few tablets out there that run Microsoft Windows. So that was just an example of other opions you have out there. Another thing to think about is that there are a lot of phones running on Android as for tablets also. So there is going to be a lot more compatibility between devices because most of them will run on Android. With Apple your limited with their products and don't have other outside options. The tide will turn with more offerings for Android because it will become main stream because most devices and manufacturers now are adapting the Android platform,while the ""I"" line of products are only exclusive to Apple. Will be like the Beta max vs VHS. Beta had better quality but most manufacturers adapted the VHS format instead of Beta. Well Beta died because everyone was making VHS products.

Don't slam me if your an ipad lover. It's just things to think about. Don't know why people get so defensive about negative reviews about this thing. They must be the ones replacing their old Apple stuff with the newer models that have the newest inovation (cough, cough). What's new for next year? A flash for the camera? Or wait, maybe a phone feature. That way you can get rid of your cell phone and only carry the ipad around and not have to carry both. There are a lot of fan boys out there defending the ipad with not much to back it up and they take it personal. I think they are in denial and trying to justify their purchase. Well people you are the ones Apple preys on and you fall for it.

Update: I finally broke down and got an Acer 7 inch A100 tablet for my daughter for Christmas. And after using it for a while, I will still stand by what said about the limitations and uses of a tablet. And the Acer A100 is only 7 inches perfect size for holding for long periods of time or for traveling instead of a bulky 10 inch. it can keep up with the ipad2 and has ports for micro sd, micro usb, micro HDMI, and hey even a flash for one of the two cameras. Hear that? A simple flash for the camera. Oooh...Oh wait, the ipad3 might get that, can't wait, it will make it the best ipad ever. Whatever..."	3	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I bought the first generation ipad and was pretty pleased with it.  I must admit that I had alot more fun with the ipad 1 due to the fact that it was unlocked, so I virtually got everything free.  The only problem, if you will, is that it lacked a webcam, and the ipad 2 solved that very problem!  Although the webcam isn't the best out there, it gets the job done, but if you're looking for a professional resolution, prepared to be dissapointed!  Ipad 2 basically does exactly the same thing as the first generation in terms of features. The only difference is the fact that it's thinner and lighter (HALLELUJAH!).  I enjoyed it when it arrived, but just gotta wait for a jailbreak to enjoy its full potential, but so far has the same limitations such as no flash, glares on the screen in sunlight, not bullet proof (sarcasm intended) etc.  In general the ipad is not for school, work, or anything serious of that nature (I TRIED typing a 2000-word essay, surely was not fun).  Things like the ipad is just for the trend and casual uses like surfing the net, it looks cool, fun to play with, but is not gonna beat a laptop in terms of effiency and definitely not internet speed.  Overall an OKAY experience, if I had a jail break I'd definitely upgrade this rating :PP	3	electronics
