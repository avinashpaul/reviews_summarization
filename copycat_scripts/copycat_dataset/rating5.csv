B0013FRNKG	"Have ipad 1 and will probably get the ipad 2 but seriously, who would pay a 1000$ or more when you can just wait a BIT and get it at bestbuy or Walmart for 820$?  kudos to the profiteers if they can get people to pay double this, but for anyone that pays this, id say ""a fool and his money are soon parted"""	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	Great product. Fast delivery!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Amazing	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This was an outstanding deal! I paid 70% less than what other sellers were asking for. Obviously I was expecting something wrong with it. My unit didn't have one scratch, works fine, does not lag, holds a charge. It did come engraved with some business guys name and his title on it but for the price, that is a non issue. The charger and cable that it came with work fine. From my experience, those go bad so I am almost waiting for that to stop working. Overall, I'd highly recommend.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Very pleased  shipped very fast and was just like it said	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	EXCELLENT!! Everything is perfect! Shipped the same day I bought it! Looks brand new! I bought myself a $1,000 ipad at Apple for work and my two children have taken it over as their own. So I bought them this one for under $100 and this one is just as good as the one I bought for $1,000. There is not a single mark or sign of wear any where on it! Camera works great too! More then pleased!!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Bought these as Christmas gifts for my daughters. They were in awesome condition when we received them.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Awesome price and works perfect. Looks brand new. The only thing that sucks is that the charger doesnt stay in and falls out easily, not sure if its the iPad or just the charger. Other than that awesome :)	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This product was in better condition than they described. Very pleasantly surprised!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Still in working condition. Purchased for my son for xmas as a trial run before purchasing a new one. He has used it every single day. At the time of purchase he was seven years old. He and his two cousins (five & six) all have had their share with it! Great buy!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	One of the best product that I ever bought. Every time I use it, I hold it like a child. It serves me well.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"We keep this iPad on our dining table to answer questions that [always!] arise during dinnertime conversations.  Google has become a ""member of the family""!"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	All app work great  it came with nice hard case  I love it it was a cheap price and Iam glad I brought it	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Love this!  It does occasionally freeze,  and sometimes arbitrarily returns to the home screen.  The app I was using will still be open.  Not a huge problem.  Overall I feel this was a pretty good deal for the price.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	Excellent!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Good product (as description). Good vendor.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Item arrived much quicker than I expected with it not being a prime purchase. Looks brand new no dings, scratches and dents in the product I received. I am very happy with my purchase. I have wanted an IPad for a while but didn't want to pay that much for a new ""toy"" this was the perfect alternative to buying a new one. Would recommend in a heartbeat!"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Superior product and still is, years later!!!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"The Compromiser

  If you're someone who wants the name brand quality of Apple, but does not want to spend hundreds of dollars on a new IPad, then this is the ideal product for you. It can do everything that a new version can do, but costs under 100$ used. Also, If you have any other Apple products this is will be a lovely addition to your collection. You can sync it with your Mac, IPhone, or Apple watch and have all your apps and information together synced on the same cloud. It is perfect for the Apple aficionado on a budget looking for the best compromise between performance and price.

Tech Specs, Battery Life, and Durability

 While it may only be the second generation Ipad, it still has the very fast processing power of 1.0 GHz and 512 MB of RAM. You will not even notice you're using an older generation Ipad because it can also handle current ios software. It comes used, meaning it has a few minor scratches on the back, but this is not an issue if you're going to buy a case for it. With the case it looks, feels, and acts brand new!
 Even without the case this Ipad is extremely durable and can survive the wear and tear of life. You will notice it does not scratch easy as only the highest of falls or the deepest of cuts will penetrate its outer exterior and touch screen. The battery life is excellent as well; you can expect it to last all day on a nightly charge. Apple tech specs state that this device has a battery life of ten hours, and this is continuous usage of surfing the web, streaming, or playing music.

Final Considerations

 It comes safely sealed in custom made protective bubble wrap, therefore you can expect it to arrive safe and sound on your doorstep in two business days if you're a Prime member. It is not the biggest or the fastest Ipad to date, but buying used saves you anywhere from $400-$500 if you bought it new. Not only do you save hundreds, you also can do almost everything that the newer generations can do. If you're looking for a device for basic tablet uses such as streaming, surfing the web, listening to music, using apps, making Face time calls, checking email, etc. this Ipad will do it all."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Arrived quickly, and looks brand new. Holds a charge perfectly. I have only had to charge it 2 times since I got it on Jan 5, 2018 and it is Jan 29, 2018. It is a bit slow but nothing unexpected. I paid for an older Ipad and got a brand new looking Ipad. I am very happy with my ipad.
Would purchase again. Love it."	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	Great little unit for the price --(used)	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Love my iPad!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	What's there to say?  I'm an Apple user, so buying this one (at the price it was offered) was never a problem... although, I must admit that I used to think that the iPad was the dumbest, most useless invention ever.  In fact, I bought it so that my son would leave me alone, and to give him a device to watch videos stored in its small drive.  Now... I am the one using it (a lot!) to watch Amazon and YouTube videos mostly.  There are some apps for him in it that I may delete as he gets older, but, as of right now, considering, I think it's a good purchase.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	Say what you want, but the Apple iPad 2 is fantastic. I don't know what it is about other android tablets, but they seem to have a limit on their usability. I have had my iPad 2 for about 4 years and I still use it to this day. I use it as a reader, browser, email, some mobile games, etc. It just works so flawlessly every time and it's super dependable. I'm a very active user and even the battery life is exceptional. Even years later, I can go days without the need to recharge the device. I also have a newer one (an iPad Air) that was given to me for Christmas and it's also great, but with the iPad 2, it just seems like they got everything right.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	Great.  Works excellent.  Looks like New.  But we still can not set somethings up because the previous owner has used up the ability.  I did not have this issue with a Kindle.  The iPad needs to have a clean slate when buying a refurbished iPad.  I wish, I could set up for the lost iPad feature.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	The iPad 2 can't do all the newer tricks like use Siri or use your finger print to activate it or apps, but it serves well for someone interested primarily in email management and Netflix watching.

B0013FRNKG	Did not send new as advertised, was used and locked. Came with wrong cord. Had to return it and very inconvenient.  That was the original review.....and then you see, I had my original iPad2 beside it. I needed another for the office, so in the hurry to unwrap, there was a mix up.  I was not understanding why it was locked. AHHH. I packed it up to return and as I backed out... I wondered,,,,is it possible....I mixed them up?  YES, Yes indeed. I publically apologize. ps and the cord, for the actual new one, is correct.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"The company took care of us by replacing the product that was broken during shipping the
iPad works good and was a great price"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This is the best Tablet I have ever owned. I  used to own a 7 inch Rca android tablet and this iPad works so much better. The screen size and picture are so much better. The cameras work well and it is great for games,even more demanding ones like asphalt 8. The newest iOS the iPad 2 supports is 9.3.5. With that being said you can still get almost every app still and it works like the newest models. You can save so much money buying the 2 instead of a newer model. This is better than even Samsung,this is the best tablet ever! This tablet is so great I am using it right now to leave this review!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	It's apple nothing more to say, a perfect product.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"Bought this awhile back. I'm glad I found this model. Does what I need it to and if there were any scuffs, they weren't noticeable enough to bother me.

However I did happen to get a faulty wall charger with the ipad. Perhaps just bad luck."	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	bought this 'used' when my ipad mini stopped working.  does what it's supposed to do, very portable for info on the go.  BIG PLUS, this is a cellular tablet which is definitely worth the extra dollars.  don't have to depend on finding a wifi spot.  TIP.  if you use little cellular data, check out T-MOBILE.  I bought their SIM card for .99 and selected FREE data plan from them.  If you go over the 'free' amount, you can then instantly buy some more data in a pay as you go.  Daily, monthly as you need  it at good prices.  WORKS FOR ME!!!!!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Flawless!!!!	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	Meet my expectations!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Brought it a two years ago, Works great! Thank you!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Not only is the iPad in perfect condition visually, it works perfectly too! Although it's an early model (2nd generation) it contains updated software so is compatible with every app I want to load. The camera also is amazing, considering this was the first iPad to have a camera. It's all in the software updates, which are truly awesome.

Had a small issue when, on day 2, the iPad stopped working and began to ask me for a passcode. I have an iTunes password, but it wanted a passcode. The former owner must have programmed one in and I could not get around it. Contacted the seller, who emailed me directions on how to restore the iPad to factory settings, and it has been working perfectly ever since.

If you are choosing between getting an inexpensive tablet or a used/refurbished iPad, don't hesitate to do the latter. Apple quality can't be beat. And although the seller did not state that this model was ""refurbished"", it was stamped as such when it arrived. Highly recommend!"	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	This is my second ipad 2 after I forgot the first one on the train. I used the first one for about 6 years without any issue. As result of that durability I opted for a used cheap, old ipad again instead of going for for a new one that I do not trust.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	Works great in great condition very happy with the product would definitly recommend	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Although this can hold a SIM card, essentially making a comically large phone, mine does not. It works just fine on WiFi, as you would expect any apple product to work.

B0013FRNKG	Excellent condition!  Case and screen are unblemished.  I am very impressed.  The OS was old enough to cause problems out of the box, but once I did factory reset and downloaded the latest version, it works perfectly.  Bought it as a birthday present for my wife, and along with a 12 dollar case, it looks great.  We both have IPhone 6s, so this will be perfect for her to use primarily for a reader & personal organizer.  Thank you to the Seller, two thumbs up!!!	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	it's an iPad.  what more can I say?  I'm kind of irritated though, it clearly says it comes with iOS 7, but I received it with iOS 9.1 on it, which means I'm STILL waiting for a jailbreak.  other than that, I can't complain.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	I have shad this product for over 2 years now. Still works great. :) Gonna buy another one for my 2 year old for christmas this year seeing he has now taken mine over :)	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I have been using this product for last 4 years now and it still continues to amaze me .
Till date I haven't experienced a single glitch. Lets get to the pros and cons:
Pros:
 * The touchscreen is sublime, but that's a known fact.
 * Apple user interface though restricted in many ways, is very simple and easy to use.
 * The iPad 2's design is simple but elegant and build quality is top notch (but always
 use it with a cover).
 * Don't go by the specs of this device, because my phone also has similar specs but
 when it comes to performance the iPad 2 just smokes my Xperia U.

Cons:
 * Movie viewing experience is average because of the format of the screen.
 * There are restrictions in Apple devices which some people won't like.
 * The biggest con perhaps is that the iPad 2 is now outdated. Two versions have
 succeeded the iPad 2. It's more wise to spend a few thousands more and go for
 the iPad 4 which will come out soon.

The iPad 2 or any other iPad for that matter, is a great companion, a fun device which you can buy if you have extra money to spend. However if you need to do hardcore work, go for laptops"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Arrived quickly. Works great.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Excellent item. Wasn't expecting that a refurbished would be this good. No problems whatsoever and the screen is perfect!	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"Bought this for my wife as a surprise. She loves it.
Excellent value for money"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I bought this iPad years ago and it's still working wonderfully.  Apple makes a great product.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I bought my iPad 2 at Best Buy four years ago and still works great after upgrading to iOS 9.2.1 a few months ago. This is a great tablet for searching the web and playing games. There also a lot of downloadable apps from the Apple App Store and a number of different albums from iTunes. I have not upgraded my iPad 2 to iOS 9.3.1, due to the iCloud actviation problems and won't upgrade to a new software on this device anytime soon. Features you have on the iPad 2 are these
1. 720p Camera
2. FaceTime
3. Photo Booth
4. Safari (Internet)
5. iTunes Store
6. Apple App Store
7. YouTube app (iOS 4.2.1 to iOS 6 on iPad 2)
8. Game Center
9. Photos
10. Mail
and more!
If you are going to buy this iPad model, Siri and voice dictation aren't features and you're stuck with having to type. Anyway, this iPad is great if you are using it for simple purposes only, such as searching the web, taking photos/videos, playing games/using apps, and listening to music."	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	This Ipad came in one day and it looks and behaves as if it's brand new. I purchased this to replace my 11 year old's IPad that finally stopped working and there was no way I was going to buy him a new one. The refurbished ones at Apple (which I have previously purchased) have gone WAY up in price so this was a perfect way to replace it without breaking the bank.	5	electronics

This is an excellent device and I have updated to iOS 9.4. I treat my device well. I reccomend a newer version but this is fine. It also came with a case (previous owner bought a case) although it's not a new case. The iPad 3 and up are newer. It is an older version than the Amazon Kindles, but I trust Apple for devices than Amazon.
P.S. This is the 64gb version and has Verizon."	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	Let's just agree that this is the ultimate internet surfing device.  An iPad is meant for surfing.  A chrome book is a repurposed laptop.  Try laying around on the couch or in bed with your laptop... it's not the same experience.  Plus it's Apple...so it works as you would expect.  Eazy Peazy.  My 80 year old mom loves her iPad.  So does my 2 year old niece.  See how long your chrome book last in those scenarios.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	I know there are much fancier iPads but this one does anything I would want it to do and I thought the price was good. I absolutely love it for downloading and reading free books.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	It's a little confusing because it was obviously somebody else's and we have to eliminate the stuff that was already on there when we got it,  like unlocking it, breaking their password.  Made me a little nervous 	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I have used all kinds of tablets, but Apple makes the best. Microsoft can try all they want, but they'll always be playing catch-up with Apple. That goes for computers as well!!!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Pros: light & thin (impressively thin), great battery life (10 hours of use as advertised), screen is big, clear, and sharp.  The guts (cpu, ram, etc.) are quick and stable.  Sensitivity is great.  With a full wrap case, it responds to every touch.  Sturdy and durable, but with a case it's even better. Love this thing (and no I'm not an apple fan boy, used to be anti Apple but products like this got me hooked!)

Cons: speaker.  The speaker is pointed away from the user.  Which makes it quite for the user and louder for everyone around th user.  Need external speaker for music and what not, and head phones if you are planning to use it while others watch tv or whatever.  Also the storage is sort of small.  I'd say it's worth the extra $ for a bigger hard drive.  64 is best value, but the 32 is decent.

This IPad is fantastic!  Insanely thin, yet still very sturdy.  Screen is sharp, and clear.  As to its size, it's as big as I can be, and still be portable.  Comfortable and big enough for adult size hands, yet still small enough for my 6 year old to use.  Extremely light! And the battery life is great.  I didn't believe that it would really have a 10 hour battery life as advertised, but I sit here corrected.  The battery is no joke and really gives you 10 hours of actual use.  My only hang up (with all I (pad, touch, phone etc.) is the speaker.  While it produced sharp crisp sound it is pointed away from the user.  This diminishes the volume levels a lot as far as what you hear while using it, while it is extremely loud to any one sitting around you.  If I want to watch something or play a game while my wife is watching tv, I have to use head phones.  The sensitivity on the touch screen is perfect.  Not sure yet if you can adjust it or not, but it's at a perfect level just the way it is.  It is sensitive enough that with a full case/ screen protector it reacts to every touch still.  I would recommend strongly to buying a great quality full protection case, and decent external speaker, and a good set of head phones.  As far as storage, the 32 gig should be the minimal.  I can fill up 16 gigs very quickly, so it's worth it even for casual use to get something bigger than the 16 gigs.  64 gig is the best value, but the 32 is still respectable.  So far so good.  I love this thing.  Bought it for my son, but fell in love with it.  Buying a second one for myself!"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Very nice ipad.  I would trust this seller again for future purchase.  Great price.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	We have had this for years and it has performed flawlessly.  We love it!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I have used it everyday for the past 3.5yrs, carried it with my across states, used it to call family, play games, watch youtube, utilize Puffin for its flash capability, and this little gadget is a solid companion to take anywhere and do what you need. Granted I never went past IOS 6.1.1, so I don't know how well it works with the newer IOS's, But I can say that it is very decent with what I have now. Not only that but the battery is holding out okay so far, it may not last a week a charge as it did before, it may be that I use it more heavily now, but even so it still lasts between 9-15 continuous run hours.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Great ipad looks new	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	works just like my last one - can't really tell the difference.  There has been only a couple very minor easily fixed gliches which doesn't really differ from my original one either.  Happy customer	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"I recently bought the I-pad 2 in order to attempt to keep up with school. It offers fantastic apps for keeping up with school as well for entertainment. The device also offers great battery life as well as portability
The I-Pad is backed by the app store which is the central hub for application developers to create some incredibly useful tools. The app store shines when it comes of ease of use. Instead of having to go through pages on internet to find a specific application that I need I can quickly find them through the app store and they will be supremely cost efficient as well.
 Allowing application developers an open platform to present some of their amazing ideas doesnt only assist with school; it can also lead to fun and often addictive forms of entertainment. The I-Pad comes backed with apples I-Tunes giving you an infinite selection of music to download and play. If you don't want to pay the small fee either you can download other applications that allows you to listen to music for free. They also offer a wide array of movies that are played with excellence 10 inch screen size.
 The I-Pads versatility is not to be overlooked either. Its compact size allows for great portability without needing a laptop bag or anything to big. . Its battery life is incredibly long lasting me 2 days at times without a charge using it in almost every class and studying from 8 AM to 6PM. Though I do recommend that you should put some sort of protective case over it because it can be quite fragile. There is an also an issue presented that if it does run of battery that it may actually stay off and won't turn back on unless you do a factory reset. This means you lose all of your data but with cloud storage this doesnt pose that huge of a problem.
The I-Pads few glitches pale in comparison to the benefits this product can offer. For a student like myself it has been one of my main tools for studying, doing homework, or taking notes in class. The seemingly endless list of applications and songs offer unlimited entertainment as well. The portability and batter life only add to its ease of use as well."	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	We have always had android products and were hesitant to make the leap to Apple.  My husband was anti-Apple even though he had never owned or really used any Apple products.  He thought they would be too complicated and not as user friendly as windows based or android based tablets/computers.  After much research, he conceded to trying out this apple iPad 2, and in fact decided to order 2 since it was so well priced and so that he would not have to share his with me or the kids. :)  We both LOVE them.  I frequently use mine in the kitchen reading recipes off of pinterest or other websites.  I also use the kindle app almost daily since I read a lot.  My husband loves the ease and portability of his and takes it to church and bible studies where he can easily access all that he needs and quickly.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	I found out something about the iPad. You know how it's supposed to turn the angle of the screen to always be facing you? Well, it only does that if you pick it up. If you sit it down, then go around you can actually be looking at it upside down. It's because it can't sense where you're at only how you're holding it. I wonder if the newer generation fixed this issue.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"I bought the 64GB Wifi + AT&T 3G model in white (marketplace seller was Vius). I was a bit skeptical about receiving a new piece for $359 given that the original IPad 2 models are priced much higher.  I did receive what appears to be an authentic, new unit and it seems to be working well so far. Mine came with IOS 8 and I upgraded it to IOS 9. The only oddity is that my units model number is FC984B/A whereas the seller advertises the model as MC984LL/A. So, I am not sure what exactly I got. When I google the FC984B/A model to see details, the only result I get is on amazons UK site. I am hoping this is not some rejected series in the Apple production line :-( So far, so good though.
Will update this review if I run into any problem."	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	I have bought this as a refurbished I-Pad, the price was so low that if it only lasted a month I would be happy. I was shocked when I opened the shipping box, I thought the shipper had shipped a brand new I-pad.  Their were no scratches - anywhere- non -  zilch absolutly like brand new and it performs like brand new. I have nearly 5,000 pictures and nearly that much music, Facebook, e-mail, I watch the latest movies, and  my grand-kids play all their favorite games.  Yes,....I could go on and on about how happy I am with this refurbished device,.....I will never buy new again as long as I can buy certified refurbished.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"If you are international students who are considering to purchase the first tablet, this review is very useful! It is because I was in the same situation like you two years ago, and now I am very glad that I purchased the iPad.

Unlimited Books Can Be Purchased From Anywhere
As an international student, I believe you wished that you could read more books in your first language. An iPad will solve your problem! When I started using it for the first time, I was skeptical about reading books with the tablet. However, surprisingly, it was very easy to read. The size of screen is big enough and the size of fonts can be adjusted so that it was so much more comfortable to read books on iPad than on iPhone.

These days, I even believe that reading ebook on iPad is more convenient than on paper version because most of books can be purchased online, and they are cheaper than the paper version. Once books are purchased, all of them will be downloaded on your iPad permanently so that you do not need to carry many books from your home country any more!!

Great Support for Classes
Heavy reading assignments are challenging for international students. However, my iPad has been very useful for those assignments. For example, if there is an unfamiliar vocabulary on a homework PDF file, iPad gives you the translation of the word by simply touching it. Therefore, you can keep reading the file without guessing the meaning of unfamiliar words. In addition, since iPad is quite light, and the battery lasts about 10 hours without charging, you can access to reading materials anywhere and anytime. Because of this portability, you can read assignments in a small portion at a time instead of reading files in front of a computer for many hours.

I have been using my iPad every day since I purchased it, and I cannot imagine my school life without having it. This is how much my iPad helped my college life and that is why I am giving 5 stars for the evaluation. If you want to read books in your first language or have difficulty of reading assignments, I highly recommend you to purchase the iPad. It is a powerful tool to change your college life dramatically. By using it, I hope you will have a wonderful time studying overseas!!"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	No problems at all. Worked perfectly and looked perfect.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	So far so good.  It was a gift no complaints	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I bought this iPad 2 four and a half years ago.  My family has been using it daily.  Actually, it is my wife's baby.  The previous two versions of iOS updates made this model of iPad sluggish.  How would I know?  We have four different iPads at home.  However, the latest iOS 9.0 has made this iPad very responsive again.  My wife couldn't be happier.  The 3G also works great.  Instead of using my iPhone 6 plus, we find the larger screen much easier for us to see when we travel.

This high quality well made iPad is a gem and it is highly recommended.  It has given us over four and half years of fun.  Oh, the battery is still holding up great.  We love it!"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Very happy. I will recommend this to all my friends.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	I ordered two of these for our church music team. We are trying to go paperless and want to use ipad for our music. Let me just say one thing. It's apple and I've never had issues with any apple products. I got these used and so they came with a few scratches but they work flawlessly and even our older ladies in our music team are figuring these babies out. Haha Are you looking for a great tablet that won't fail you by lagging, freezing and being slow? Buy yourself and apple ipad 2. Great tablet and great price.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	What a great tablet.  I never owned an Apple product so I was a little nervous.  My cell phone is an android so I thought I would have trouble navigating an Apple but when I turned it on, it was so simple to operate.  I am still exploring the different options it contains but so far, so good.  It is light weight and has the perfect size screen.  I have face-timed my family across the country and there was no lag time.  I could see and hear them perfectly.  I think that is the best feature.  I would definitely recommend the Apply iPad 2, 2nd generation.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"Happy with it - brand new iPad 2 right out of the package.  We needed to replace our son's iPad 2 (assistive technology) and it was cheaper to replace it with the same thing than buying a latest-generation one and having to replace all his accessories with it.

One thing to note - this doesn't particularly matter in our case since we're not adding it to our cellular services - just using Wifi when needed - but when ordering I got to choose either Verizon or AT&T; I chose Verizon and it came with AT&T instead.  If we had needed to add the device to our services, I don't know if I would've needed to return it or what."	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"Exactly as advertised--like new, in original box with OEM charger.  Arrived quickly and partially charged to use right away.  Has had extensive continuous use since.  Grand kids are entertained for hours while they are here and they borrow it for road trips with their parents.  Bought an inexpensive kid-proof case (from Amazon) in bright pink so the tablet is easy to find and relatively indestructible.  If the seller reads this, he will cringe to discover his pampered i-pad has become a kid's toy, so he may be pleased to know that I downloaded all my kindle books onto it and my wife has read a couple of them so far (even though she has a Kindle Fire and Kindle unlimited subscription). So buy with confidence from this seller.  If he says ""mint"" or ""like new,"" believe him."	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"I've been having this iPad for three years now going to four years now
I have to tell you now
I have barely experience any faults or mishaps with it
It's still functioning as well as it was when I bought it
It's really durable
Efficient and portable
It has a fast response to touch sensitivity
The only downer would be that sometimes it freezes and takes time to return back to normal
Also one piece of advice
Always back up your information on iCloud
Because one day my iPad turned off after it froze
And I had to connect it to iTunes on my laptop
And have to start again
My last back up was seven months ago
So I had to do a lot of work to derive all my information back again
So beware of that
The only fault you should watch out
For is the freezing
Also the battery life is amazing
It last longer if you reduce the brightness of the screen
I charge once a day now and it last throughout the whole day
I am also a college student
So it really helps me for writing projects, reading projects, designing projects, typing essays and papers
I would highly recommend this device to Anyone looking for something effective efficient and durable"	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"I was pleasantly surprised because it did not have a blemish on it and it did not smell
like cigarette smoke. It obviously had a new protective screen cover on it and it works fine. The only thing I would do differently is I would have purchased at least a generation 3 because my gen2 doesn't work with the pressure sensitive 'Pencil' brand stylus with the 'Paper' drawing software which is awesome. That was my fault for not doing my research before hand but I am very satisfied with it."	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"Device worked great and was in great shape for a refurb.
Everything was what I expected."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	What can I say. It is an Ipad. My grandson loves it and I buy too much content for it. When you can pry it out of his hands he is a really nice kid. I am switching him the the childrens kindle because it can be too difficult to control some of the content on this for children who are smarter at getting around the controls than their gaurdians. Then try to pry it away from me.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	For my grandad, worked great! Wasn't sure how much he would use it so went with a cheaper refurb. Totally worth it, worked perfectly and grandad is happy!	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	Received my iPad 2 32GB AT&T refurbished. I chose to buy the iPad as I already had an iPhone. It Arrived within 4 days. (Opted for free shipping.) Cosmetically you cannot tell it is used. It looks & operates like it's Brand New!! In my opinion, It runs excellent!!  I would highly recommend this seller. I am extremely happy with this purchase and for the reasonable price!  I found out it does not come equipped with a SIM card. Also, if you run it off of wifi, you don't need a SIM card. I called AT&T they explained that you don't necessarily need a SIM card. If you want to pay for monthly service, they will give you a SIM card for free. Prepaid monthly service  is about $50/mo. Then you would have wifi while roaming. Overall, pleased with my purchase and definitely money well spent.  -Julie P  Hartford CT	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	I invested in this used iPad2 since it was time for a laptop replacement and I realize I have minimal needs as far a computers go at this point in my life (I am 100). It is compact and immensely thinner and lighter compared to the MacBook pro I was previously using. It's the perfect handheld interface to view video, surf the internet, and use apps...especially useful for image based social media since the screen is generous, and as a primary tool for someone without a smart phone. Overall, it is a rather nice device.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	Gift o a friend, I love my samsung tablet but might switch to apple soon	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This iPad arrived as advertised, in like new condition.  Although the box was obviously shrink-wrapped by someone other than Apple, I could find no signs of wear and the charger was still in its sealed container.  The battery does not as much charge as my previous one, likely due to age.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Bought for my elderly parents and they love it!  It was as good as brand new!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Better than expected! I bought this item used for roughly $172 with tax. The item was ""acceptable,"" but it's near perfect! Nothing is wrong with the iPad's inner workings. The screen is completely free of scratches. There's only one tiny dent in upper left hand corner. However I expected worse so I'm very pleased! And I couldn't care less as long as it works. Seriously, there is no reason to buy this item new. You can get a terrific price here on Amazon. Get a brand new Air if you need it to be new. I will add that this iPad2 is running iOS 8 very well (if anyone happened to be worried). I am somebody who doesn't need a fancy camera or screen on a tablet. If you agree, do like I did and get a good deal by buying used!"	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	Excellent condition. Works great.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Even though this ipad is four years old it still makes us happy and I am surprise that even though technology advances so fast this has not gotten old, the model I have is wifi only because I could not afford cellular data plan back then, now I got an iPad mini with cellular from tmobile store.

First lets go with the cons
Cons:
You cannot sync music to ipod or other MP3 players.
Does not have flash support but can be added through a third party browser.

Now let's go with the pros
Pros:
Good battery life.
Nice screens.
Internet speeds.
Just as Productive as a heavier laptop.
Plenthora of apps available to both of our iPads.
Fun gaming.
Responsive screens.
And good for education and business.

Conclusion: this is some of the high end tablets in the market, so to say, if you have the money I highly recommend an ipad and if you have the money I would recommend the 3G or cellular model."	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"I was a little leery about buying a refurbished Ipad, but I couldn't have been more wrong! The screen is pristine new and I think there is one very tiny scratch somewhere on the back of it. I am thrilled with it. I subscribe to Pandora and I love how I can move around the apartment  with it and have the music playing wherever I'm at.

It works beautiful, looks beautiful, and is a nice back up to my laptop, which is getting rather old and slow. Buying this refurbished Ipad was much cheaper. :)"	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"The iPad 2 is a great product.  I bought a Zagg keyboard to attach to the iPad and my life has been great.  The iPad is a great tool for communicating, running apps, surfing the web, and reading email.  I do wish apple would have included siri with the iPad.  Hands free interaction with the device would have been helpful on the move.  It could have been so much more.

I run numbers, facebook, pages, and instant messaging on the iPad.  I like iMovie editing and found the software to be very reliable on the hardware.  You will need to buy ear head set to listen to music.  The built in speakers are not very loud.  The microphone is adequate but not great.  I found the dragon voice recognition system made too many errors to be useful.  I use webreader to listen to my stories.

iPhoto is great.  I wish it could find people by voice command.  This is a feature I look forward to using.

Email interface is great.  You send alot of time tapping to remove obsolete emails

No viruses.  Yeah

IBooks works well on the iPad.  I wish that iBooks was capable of reading your ebook

Microsoft remote desktop works on the iPad2.  I wish that rd worked with a tap interseption capability rather than a drag and arrow click.  It takes time to navigate.

the iPad 2 screen is ok.  It smears easily.  A new nano material that resists smearing needs to be developed."	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	I purchased this iPad for my husband. It took four months for him to use it. He was resistant because he thought it was complicated. He now uses it daily and greatly enjoying it.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Perfect for my 3 year old!! She loves it and is no longer on my cell phone.  I would recommend this option for any young child.  I feel that the older refurbished version is much better then a newer one for her.  I am not concerned with her harming it due to the price.  I have recommend this option as oppose to going to a cell store and adding it a plan.  Her apps that she uses I have placed on the ipad.  She doesn't need cell service to use these apps when we are traveling.  So having it and using my wifi at home is a perfect option for us.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This was a great buy. I bought this for my 14yo daughter, who showed her nana how to do a few things so I turned around and helped her order her iPad which I'm currently waiting for as we speak.

I had the first generation Kindle for a long time, but when it finally pooped out (lots of use for a good number of years - great product), I decided to replace with it an iPad - I am so glad I did.  In a fire, it'd be my phone and my ipad that I'd grab on the way out the door.  I absolutely love reading on it, and it's handy for internet, e-mail and all the other great features.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Bought this as a present for my mother, along with a Essential MonkeyCase. The iPad is phenomenal, very little wear and tear, no glitches, it's awesome. Though I wish mum would use it for more than reading. *sigh*	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	Came exactly as described and incredibly fast. I never thought I'd be able to afford a nicely working tablet like this, but it works absolutely excellently and is so useful in school. Any school students purchasing this should consider getting the App called Notability and also getting a bluetooth keyboard, as well as a stylus (I use Adonit, althought I'm switching soon because it makes a tapping sound).	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	Started off as a gift for my mother, it now belongs to me.  If I'd have purchased it for me, I would have gone up another 16GB.  Other than issues with how Apple's proprietary decisions keep other devices like USB from directly inputing to their tablets isn't a factor in this review of a fine tablet.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I have had this iPad for almost 3 years now and it is still working perfectly! The reason I liked this product so much was because it is so simple to use. The camera is great it focuses good, it can zoom in great and a wonderful battery life too, and it dosent take that long to charge up!

B0013FRNKG	I bought this ipad2 in 2011 so it is now 2014 with the new iPad 2 air and iPad mini 3. My iPad 2 still works perfectly good no complaints. I use it every single day with not one problem. My son tells me that I need to upgrade he's only 15 what does he know. I know that I don't need to upgrade yet the wifi still works great, the graphics still beautiful, I don't take pictures so who cares about that. I was wondering how long will this tablet last and apparently a very long time. I just wanted people to know just in case they wondering if they should purchase an apple product. I do everything on this thing read books, play games, watch movies, check the news, shop and many other things. The apple company makes some fantastic products.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"This iPad may be the the successor to the iPad, but thankfully it came pre-installed with Apple's latest software: iOS 7 right out of the box, which makes it up to date ad ready to go! It's so beautiful with it's glossy white faceplate and silver backplate hardware and its gorgeous software that when held in the hand is a visual masterpiece crafted by Apple! Not only is it beautiful, it is also lightweight and feels so premium when held. I, myself couldn't believe that I owned an iPad as I've wanted one since it initially released. It has that effect on you: the disbelief effect that'll have you thinking like me: ""Wow, do I really own and am holding this innovative piece of art?"" I have no complaints. it's portable, lightweight and a really convenient device!"	5	electronics

Transferring data from the 16 to the 32 was easy.  I was able to retain all of my data.  I found I did have to reload my favorite Youtube channels and facebook.  that was more than likely an issue with me rather than the tablet."	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	I was very nervous about buying a used iPad but was pleasantly surprised. The iPad was in great condition. No scratches on the screen and it works perfectly. I've had it for months now and have had no problems with it at all. We were so happy with our iPad that we ordered a second one from the same seller. My only issue was with the charger. It charges really slow. I had to go buy a new one, which works much better.	5	electronics

I used it for everything (until I bought an iPhone). Temple Run? Check. Annotating scripts? Done. Surfing that world wide web in the sky? All the time (until I bought an iPhone). Great stuff, great price, and if I remember correctly, shipping was reasonable and timely.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	I have a couple of new ipads and now this refurbished iPad. To be honest, I cannot tell any difference other than the price. The refurbished iPad is EXACTLY the same as the one I bought brand new. I cannot even tell them apart.  I will always considered a refurbished iPad in the future if I am not needing one of the brand new ones (and really, who does?). This is a great way to get an iPad and save a good amount of money!	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"Better than I could ever have hoped for.  Like-new doesn't adequately describe this item.  I could not find a flaw, scratch or anything wrong.  Had it been packaged in an original Apple container, I would not have known any different.  This company actually didn't have the WIFI only iPAD as I had purchased so they upgraded me to a 3G Verizon WiFi version at no additional charge.  I've purchased 2 other ""refurbished"" iPAD 1's from another company and was satisfied but the price on this iPAD2 was priced better here than anybody else.  This company sent me a flawless item.  BUY from them.  I know for sure I will."	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	I'm so happy with this product I'm practically walking on rainbows! I needed an iPad 2 to replace my mom's that got stolen and I didn't have alot of cash. I saw a refurbished (like new) advertised and jumped on it! It came early and if I didn't know it wasn't new - the packaging and tablet condition wouldn't have clued me in. The iPad looked like it just came off the assembly line and works like a dream! I'd buy again and again from this seller.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I bought this iPad 2 and a wireless router for my parents who live on the coast.  My sister was having a baby on the west coast.  They have never used apple products before and used it flawlessly to FaceTime my sister during and after the baby.  Since my parents are unable to travel, the world of texting and FaceTime and email have been made it easy for them to communicate. And for an inexpensive refurbished iPad that arrived just on time before my travels cross continent this has changed their lives.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	It's 2014 and I'm just now getting an iPad 2 because I am a college student who doesn't have parents to buy everything I desire so I bought an iPad 2 because it's cheaper than an iPad 3 4 & the iPad Air! And I don't like the iPad mini because it's just too small so the iPad 2 is perfect for me and I love it!!! I bought my iPad used from cain_ak  and it looked brand spanking new! It had a clear screen no dents no scuffs or scratches anywhere on the device! My iPad is also updated to the latest software which is iOS 7.1.2 and my iPad came with all new accessories! So if there is anyone out there who is looking for a iPad 2 is excellent condition I recommend you buy it from cain_ak I spent less than $230 bucks on my iPad and I'm just so in love with it!!	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	We Had this iPad for about 4 years! This is apples best ipad. Even thought the iPad air is out and stuff, this iPad continues to show quality. It still works, it's still somewhat fast, battery life's okay. The screen is so durable that it took 4 drops on the concrete and one on a floor tile to finnaly crack. We got it replaced at screen solution who did a great job at protecting it. By the way buy a good case for this like the griffin survivor. I don't recommend the otter box cases. Although they are durable the are made cheap.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Nicer than I thought it would be.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Got this as a present for my dad. Works wonderfully.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Was my first big purchase and it was worth it.  Bought this for my daughter and there was only one small scratch on it she is extremely satisfied with it.  Well worth the cost.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Ignorance is bliss. I work at BestBuy and people always ask me ""APPLE or ANDROID."" Of course it depends on the user and most people who come in the store weren't technologically savvy. So, the majority of people wanted something easy to pick up and learn. Therefore, the majority of my recomendations were the iPad. I am in college and I have an internship. Both of these roles I use the iPad in. I am even using my iPad right now. I have a Macintosh computer and I found myself using my iPad for the majority of my computing needs. The iPad has also paid itself off by the cost of Text Books alone. Every book I get on my iPad saves me on average about $100. E text books are much cheaper than buying books on campus. I also have a keyboard case which they sell on Amazon for less $50.00. I use an app called Pages, which is an Apple developed app, that allows me to edit, import and export Word Documents. Not to mention its movie and music capabilities. I also invest heavily and the iPad has made my life so much easier when it comes to managing my investments and banking. Overall, the iPad has been a life saver for me and my family. Also, another great product that is a must have is a Zagg Invisible shield. They are a little difficult to put on but they have instructional videos on how to do it. Thanks for reading."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I bought this iPad to use for college and have never regretted it! I use it every day for school, flying and work!

B0013FRNKG	Excellent! Just as the seller said it was, brand new. Came in a plastic sealed Apple ipad box. It had an unopened charger, along with the users manual. When it arrived UPS, it needed a signature. I appreciate that so it wasn't left outside my front door for anyone to see and take. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a new, unused IPad 2.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	I honestly believe that all the iPads following this one have been pretty much pointless. This iPad does everything you could ever need of it. Sure it doesn't have Siri or retina display, but the price makes up for that. I use the ipad for school. It is extremely convenient and works great.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	I bought this item as a gift for my husband.  He's not much into electronic gadgets, but when he saw how I could put all my church publications on one device and find references quickly, etc. he became interested in having one.  He is beginning to investigate other apps and enjoying it more.  It has been a good introduction for him.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"Awesome product! Came in the condition it said, a few small scratches on the back, but I bought a case to go with it, so it's basically brand new. I had to update it from iOS 6 to iOS 7, but that's easy. It came with a charger & cube. No box, but it was packed very safely.

B0013FRNKG	"100% satisfaction.
This is an additional iPad two in our home. It was purchased as a second iPad for our family.  We were traveling to Italy for three weeks. The advantage of the unlocked iPad and the availability of very inexpensive data plans that could be purchased is a big plus when traveling.  Having the ability to communicate with those at home, conduct business, take photos and videos as well as being able to use the gps features, access maps and look up hotels are all valuable features of this product.  All expectations have been fulfilled +.
The seller delivered as promised. The iPad was as advertised"	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	Bought this for my daughter's sixteenth birthday. She loved that she can use the art apps and draw to her heart's content. I love how small it is, since right now her bedroom is a tad tiny and trying to go for a computer or a laptop that will help her art wise is kind of not going to comfortably fit in her room. Oh I know the iPad 2 can do a lot more, but she's happy and is in love with the art apps.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	I am very satisfied with my iPad2!  It is very versatile and more compact than my laptop.  It is so simple to grab it and utilize the Internet.

B0013FRNKG	"For being an older model, the iPad 2 is amazing! It does so much, most of the time I don't even need to turn on my PC.

It is great for:
-General web surfing
-Watching videos and movies(YouTube, Netflix...)
-Email
-Music(Pandora, SiriusXM....)
-Social Media(Facebook, Twitter....)

The price is great and I'd definitely recommend the older model for anyone looking for a cheaper option."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This one is for my wife. I love my iPad and don't know why I didn't get one before I did. Great product. Very versatile and will do most anything a laptop will do. And the applications available through the Apple store are unbelievable.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Everything works perfectly and I actually didn't notice any scratches even though you said there'd be some. I'm very happy with the purchase! Thank you.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	This is the best item i ever had from apple. It gives me alot of enjoyment cos i can watch movies on you tube and netflix and stream them on my TV to enjoy the best view. Keep it up Apple. I love your products.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Product arrived quickly and works great.  We have not had any problems with the IPad so far.  It was great not to have to drive to a store.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	My only tablet experience prior to this was my Nook Color. This machine blows me away with its potential; I may never use all of the features, but it's great to know that they are there. The colors and clarity are amazing and this is one of the older models. I am very satisfied with my purchase and got a great price, as the case was damaged cosmetically. Since it is in a protective case now, I barely remember that the dent is there; the screen is perfect, no scratches or marks of any kind. I would recommend the iPad to anyone that I know.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I bought this as a gift for my wife's birthday and she has had absolutely no complaints in using it.  A large display is great for word processing and web browsing, a decent storage capacity that will be useful for holding important info and just plain user friendly touchscreen and apps.  Fantastic!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"The ipad 2 is a terrific device! Here are the pros and cons of this excellent device.
Pros:
1 GHz A5 dual core processor
Will have iOS 8 (just)
Great graphics
Excellent performance
Thin and lightweight
Has access to the app store- that means millions of terrific apps
Pricing very reasonable,considering what you get
Cons:
No retina display
Terrible camera /0.7 mp rear /0.3 mp front
Other then that, the ipad 2 is a stunning device to read, play or work.
Review written by Doggy"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I still use an Android for my phone and probably always will. However, I like the iPad because it is so simple for work. An Android tablet would do the same and integrate well with my phone but the iPad is nice.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Great product! Used it on vacation abroad. I'm very hapyy. Very easy to use. It felt as though my iPhone grew up.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	So I received my ipad in 4 days. Seller was quick to respond and very helpful. Despite a few of the reviews saying that  their ipad was marked new but was used, I proceeded to buy mine new anyway despite those experiences after some thought. My Ipad came as described in brand new, mint condition. I am so excited to receive my order.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Love everything about this tool called Apple iPad 2! I purchased it used & true to the seller's description it was in good condition--no scratches anywhere.  So much nicer than a desktop PC. I was able to use the NOOK app to transfer all my previously purchased books! Great fun!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Love this I pad. Could not afford a generation 4. Has almost all the same features. Am having a lot of fun with it.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	iPad arrived early.  Bought this item for language facilitation.  Currently using for video to TV.  Only once snagged.  Lots of battery life and super easy to use.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	works great got in quickly. we all have on in the family now! Who needs to sit at a computer?	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Apple has really nailed it. Great product. Good form factor, fast speed, nice screen, intuitive, useful. I read on mine all the time. Research, and use it as a productivity tool. I know it is good for entertainment too, but I use mine for work. Couldn't imagine that any of the competing products can top this product by Apple. Good job. Must buy.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Thanks for being so speedy in shipping it!  I am more on the functional side, so I am loving the dictation app (Dragon) that allows me to speak my words into basic text, and email them to myself for editing (I'm always writing something... hope to publish someday soon :-)	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Very happy with my purchase, it was a gift for my hubby and he loves it.

B0013FRNKG	Great transaction.  No problems.  Arrived early in great condition.  As described.  Would use again.  Wish it had instructions for set up but had bought a book to help.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I ordered ipad mini and had to have it delivered within 5 days. I sent email to the seller and he did everything he could to get it to me on time!! That is the way to take of your client!!! I will be definitely back for more.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Perfect.
I Love de iPad, is great and my mom love it
I like and i think it is wonderfull"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Bought this for my 7 year old granddaughter.  She is a very responsible young user.  We live 800 miles apart and now she is able to talk to me through face time any time she wants.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Works great!!!! 5 stars all day long!! Definitely a great deal for how much it's worth! Lasts a long time!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I got the iPad because I needed something smaller and easier to work on. I love it. The shipping could have been better because it took almost a month to get to me but it's great for school.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I thought that this would be another fad item, but I use it all the time.  I bought it to go overseas to use as my internet and ebook reader, but now I use it for everything.  You won't find a better product out there.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Really does what I need it to do, even though it is the 2nd generation.  64 Gb is really a huge amount, even for an apps hoarder like me.  Screen quality looks very good.  Can't really see much of a difference from a retina display (though I'm sure there is one, it still looks great as is).  Still a bit heavy (which is why they have made an iPad air), but if that doesn't bother you, it is still great.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Arrived within two days, this iPad is in excellent condition.  Followed the sellers instructions for setting it up. This iPad does everything needed.  Excellent service and just as advertised.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This was a great purchase and came just as advertised! I would order again in the future when I need another IPAD!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	all excelent. perfect, thanks, good night and good luck.  the calidad of the operation in rank expected. good bye. jd	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Works wonderfully. Mother loves it. Plays with it all the time. Like a kid at Christmas. Great mothers day gift	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This iPad works great, just as described. It's for my dad since he wanted to learn to use a computer but what better than an ipad.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I love my Apple ipad 2 2nd generation Tablet. It's easy to operate and the screen is just the right size.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I purchased this iPad for my mother-in-law. She's never used a touch screen device before and the learning curve has been rather easy for her. The product arrive promptly in new packaging, and has worked beautifully.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Very good!!! My girlfriend loves it, she said it's very fun and easy to use. Great for the price!! Tks	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	THIS ITEM WAS EXCEPTIONAL AND ARRIVED EFFICIENTLY AND WELL PACKAGED. I WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED AND SINCE IT WAS A GIFT FOR SOMEONE, I REALLY APPRECIATED HOW WELL THE PRODUCT WAS AND MORE THAN MET MY EXPECTATIONS.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"THIS IS MY FIRST I PAD.  I FOUND IT VERY EASY TO WORK.  I AMY REALLY ENJOYING IT.

THANK YOU DIANE TULLI"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I already have an iPad 2, but when my friend told me that he would like very much to get one, it was my cue.  I bought one for him as a gift.  Well he likes it very much.
I would like to recommend apple products to anyone who is seriouse about their devices."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	It was really nice to get such a nice used item.  It was slightly used and not all that much cheaper than new but it was cheaper and it included a nice case.  It was just as described, in original box and all.  Thanks	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The ipad arrived on time in practically pristine condition. It took me a week to discover a small dent on the side. This is OK because I bought it used. Works like a charm!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I recommend this tablet for anybody. If is used for a lot of documents you have to purchase the correct program for your use. I love my tablet is awesome.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	When I bought one of these almost three years ago it was a pretty big investment because of the cost.  Thankfully, I still use it everyday. It can still run almost all of the apps I encounter, all though I am sure that will stop being the case shortly.  The screen looks crisp enough for web browsing and reading comics, but I would recommend the retina display on the newer models if you are going to spend an extended period of time reading text on your tablet.  I highly recommend getting a case and screen protectors to protect your purchase.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This is so much fun and really does it all! I am very happy I finally got one. Would make a great gift for anyone.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I bought two i Pads one i Pad Air and this one i Pad 2, which as mentioned above my favorite gift for my friends and family members. It's very good and fast,	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This is my first time leaving feedback for my purchase. This is the first apple device I have purchased and it has definitely fulfilled my needs starting from now. I like the response I get from this device and it does provide many applications that help me with my business. I would recommend the ipad 2nd generation for someone just starting to get into the apple products.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Yep.  Have had mine awhile, purchased the SANOXY 360 Degree Rotating Stand and I have never enjoyed anything over the past couple years as much as this.  I know they are coming out now with lots of choices.  I'm still happy with my iPAD.  It does everything I want it to.  You would not be disappointed either.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"The iPad was delivered as promised & at a good value. As an avid PC & iPhone user for several years, I've looked forward to this purchase for some time & it is everything I had hoped for.  The selling point for me on Apple products is the seamless integration with their companion devices, the ease of use & how well thought out the user interface is.
I've used the product for one week feel comfortable & productive with it."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The iPad works great, it is in perfect condition!  It is just what I expected! I could not be happier!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Enjoying the newness of all the apps, and just the learning curve.  i answered this yesterday as well, so I have no more comments.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	It was great for a first time apple and first time IPad user. Very easy to work with.  I only had it for 3 weeks and it got stolen in Germany out of my back pack, but I just bought another one, I liked it so much.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	It's great for carrying around with you and for using on the spur of the moment when you or your friends need to check on something.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	great buy!	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	Me and my dad share this tablet and its great, we bought this from verizon in 2012 it's a great tablet it does crash a little that's because it's over 2 years old but its just down right great i use it for youtube and web browsing, my dad uses it for some video, email and web browsing and it works almost flawless and it never let is down its just the perfect tablet but if you want tethering i would get the ipad 3,4 and air for wifi hotspot but this is great for everything else and that explains it all	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	My husband was thrilled to receive this!  (I had to get him off of my Ipad and this was the perfect solution)	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"The Ipad is Great, use all the time, The 64gb is well worth getting, very fast.  although
I'm used to a laptop, with a hard drive to store files, the ipad should have a hard drive."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Birthday gift for my wife instant success. It came as advertised everything new and in original package. I would recommend this to anyone.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This device has everything you could want, but finding how to work with it is very tough.  My PC experiences probably made it more difficult.  I plan to keep trying to find out how to work with  all the apps.  Might get there before the year is out.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Very nice IPad that we have used for more than a year and it is perfect. I would recommend this seller highly. Good price and is the item as advertised.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Got his unit as a gift for my Mother in-law and so far no complains. Unit is working as advertised.  Super Fast Delivery!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	the only thing you need to know is that this is a slightly better than the very first model. Still the old style charger and connector. Does not have the retina display, and is being phased out. That being said, I bought this for my 3 year old how plays learning games, so no high expectations.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Arrived 8 days ahead of schedule - absolutely no signs of wear and tear, except the engraving on the back which is mentioned in the description. Almost looks brand new. When turned on the iPad went through the registration process. Once complete it had ~50% battery life and iOS 7.0.3 - updated to iOS 7.1 and looks great. Extremely satisfied customer - Thanks Turbo Tunes! A+	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Great price and came in as promised on time. Very happy with the price and would recommend this to all my family! Thanks, Grammy	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I have not liked any iPad covers as much as this. This IPad looks brand new & works like brand new, my friends can't believe they paid more for the same thing!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	just got it and am learning the ins and out of. due to have knee surgery soon and will be laid up for a while. This will allow me to keep up with email and other sites.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Bought for 80-yr old mom and she loves it. Could not tell that it was used. Why buy new when used is just as good?	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"This is a replacement for a Dell 10.1"" laptop running Windows XP. I got tired of the constant updates, slow performance and heavy battery. Once Microcrap choose to stop supporting updates, I bought this. Now I don't have to worry any more."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Works just like it was brand new! No problems at all. The screen have no scratches and look brand new too!	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	The 32 GB and 65 GB iPad 2 have not been manufactured since 2012.  I don't believe these are new.  Most likely customer returns.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	The iPad was everything I expected.  Very satisfied in my purchase. I would buy from them again, the only thing I didn't like is how long it took to get it.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Easy to use,  as good as a  laptop  only smaller nice big screen,and the best part is THe prices are dropping. On them	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	It works great and came with a protective screen on, it should have been more bubble wrapped but it came in perfect condition	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	Great iPad at a great price.  Easy to use with updated functions.  Perfect for the husband and kids.  Wifi connects quickly.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The Ipad2 needs no further reviewing, but I greatly appreciated being able to buy it a discount of a hundred bucks from the Apple price.  I came in a new box with all accessories and ready to go.  Being able to buy the Logitech keyboard & cover (refurb) at only $25 made for a total ipad/keyboard/copver package at ~$325 with no shipping and no tax.  All in all, a very good deal from two good suppliers.  Shipping was free and fast on both items.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I have been looking for a new tablet for a few weeks now. Its hard to know what to look at or choose because there are so many different ones. I finally decided that I was just going to forget about it. Why do I need a new tablet when I still have my ipad 2?

You see all these tablets that claim this and that and have thousands of things they can do. Im actually sick of reading about all of them! My ipad already does all of those things. I used mine all through community college now Im in university and I still use it hours every day. I have friends that have other kinds of tablets. One of them has the newest ipad that I like but I was also thinking about a newer kindle which another of my friends has. The kindle is nice and so is the new ipad but when looking at the screens and then looking at my ipad I LIKED my ipad2 screen better than theirs. The colors are better. IDK why. Even my friend said that the color on mine was better than her new ipad even though that one has the newer screen.

Ive had mine for 3 years. Although its older, its still great as the new ones just not as great of a screen. The one thing I dislike is the cameras are not as great as some other tablets but I still take a lot of beautiful pictures though. But everything else is great. So, I finally realized that if I was going to buy a new tablet right now I might even buy an ipad 2 again because of how cheap they are now."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Bought for my daughter...she simply loves it. Music, movies, ebooks, game apps...she does it all.  Bought this generation because of the price. Worked out well.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	LOVE IT!!!! So easy to set up and use.  I would recommend to anyone not needing the full use of a computer but likes to search the web.  Great for older users as we'll.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This is exactly what I had hoped for. I wanted a device that I could check emails, do SKYPE, take photos, and open Microsoft applications. It's light weight and perfect for traveling.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Got this as a gift for my 80+ mother in law. Easy for her to watch Netflix, google search, and face time.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This was just as advertised and came in record time!  I am sure we will enjoy this for many years to come!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I used a gift card, saved Christmas monies, and money saved from making my own coffee for months to finally buy this...Worth it. It's like modern art, especially the white version.

B0013FRNKG	Got it for my 9 year old son.  He loves it.  I put it in a protective case so it would stand up to some kid use...  Had it for several months and he uses it all the time.  Quality product from Apple.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	LOVE IT!!!!! I literally have NO complaints about this product. It has a nice size screen, very easy to maneuver, I take it EVERYWHERE. My kids love the children apps available on the iTunes Store.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I never thought I would buy a refurb. It is wonderful. Works as it should. I will NEVER pay full price again for an Apple product. I love this ipad. I also have the mini. It was a gift. My eyes are too old to use it all day so I keep the mini next to the bed and her big brother in the Living room. This refurbished ipad is a great great deal. I love it. It would be a good deal to give to your kids if you want to update frequently but not spend a gazillion bucks. Don't be afraid to buy refurbished. No marks or scuffs or excessive use showing. It is worth it!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"So glad I researched these and bought through Amazon.  The seller was great to deal with and the tablet I actually purchased and paid for was not available and the seller made a great deal with me to upgrade to this one.

I use it many time everyday and even down load documents from work on it and take it to my meetings."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I would recommend this product and seller to anyone. I purchased the 16gb, and the must have been out so they shipped the 32gb, and i have had no problems. I will be purchasing another one in the next few months and will be sure to check this sellers listings first. Thanks	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I love my ipad 2. The product was in great condition and exceeds my expectations, If you are in need of a product such as this I  suggest this without a doubt.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Came on time. Also the device was just as posted. No damage and works well so it's a petty good deal.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	You guys are more than excellent , all the iPads looks like brand new ones. They all work perfectly . Buy from these guys, you will never regret it and they  saved  me some dollars as well  and it was good with business with you guys Thank guys	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Item was as described, even better. Been using it ever since, got it sooner than I ever expected and it works for me all day long every day. Really great condition as promised.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Puchased the white for my son's birthday---its been well over a year---no issues --no problems---had a tiny scratch on
the outside corner of the casing...but you cannot even see that with the otter box i purchased to keep this ipad alive in the hands of a 10 year old! :)  He takes this every where with him...great purchase for me."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Very satisfied with vendor. Both expedience of shipment and quality of product were excellent. This was a gift for a 13 year old nephew and he was thrilled.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I love the larger screen! The 3rd iPad 2 i have and l will hate when they're gone. Then i guess it will be repair time.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This was a gift to myself. I love, love , love this. I'm still exploring all the new and fresh applications. Well worth the price but, don't hesitate to jump right into this enjoyment.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Having expected a lot from this iPad, I was stunned to discover my great expectations had been too low. This touch pad comes every place with me and is used for; word processor, audio books, papers, and read aloud of all most any text.  When connected to Internet, this little, thin, light weight folder, has become our new family member.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I wanted an Ipad at a cheap price. So I was shopping online for a great deal and i came across this one. It shipped really fast. It was already updated with the latest IOS. Love it. I use it all the time	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	It's perfect! We needed an iPad for our Square and decided to look for a used model. The iPad was in excellent condition and it works great!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The iPad really has no competitor on the market. Other options will certainly allow you to do many similar tasks, but there is nothing that will flawlessly integrate with the rest of your Apple products like the iPad. I personally use an iPhone and a MacBook Pro in order to accomplish most of my tasks. As a student I find the usability of the iPad when reading .pdf particularly useful.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	My boyfriend loves the ipad and is already using it all the time, it was a great gift and the product is in great shape.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	My wife loves this thing, she is a novice and is learning how to use it.  She thinks it is wonderful.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I am very pleased with this product. I purchased it for my work ipad, it is the perfect size for what I need.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"The iPad2 is in near new condition. Even though this is my first Apple product I have become rather proficient in using it. It is a step up from my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 when using it on the internet, but the Kindle has been truly reliable and easy to use.
The unit arrived with a 3% battery charge so I plugged in the charger and came back to it the next morning to find it at only 74% charge. So I left it for another 24 hours while I searched the net for iPad2 battery issues. It seems everyone feels that these units are slow to recharge. When it finally reached a 100% charge I started learning how to use it. This is not a toy, it really is a computer and has many features that are not readily apparent so I bought an ""iPad For Dummies"" book on Amazon to help me get the most out of my unit. I recommend this to anyone new to an iPad. Recharges now take less time than before. I paid $214.99, including shipping, for this unit and feel like I saved 50% over a new unit. I surf the web, do emails, read my Kindle books on it and am now searching the available Apple apps.
I feel really great about this purchase and the unit. I worked for a large computer company for 38 years and always had a company laptop or whatever, so going to an Apple product was a big deal for me. Take the plunge!"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I can not say enough good things about this tablet. I love it and more so the ease at which I can carry it around vs a laptop. Battery life is superb compared to my laptop and the picture is as well.
But what really makes this so useful are all the applications you have for it and how easily you can call them up. Want to send an email or check the ones you have waiting. Easy. Want to play a video game Easy. Do you subscribe to a magazine and have a few minutes and you want to read it. Easy. Listen to music. The same. Take a beautiful and I mean beautiful picture and send it to someone quickly. Easy. Children around and you want to make a little video of them. Easy. I could go on and on and on. But the bottom line is EASY. And for what $300 or so. You can't miss."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Like the product very much , listen to music,go on internet,much convenient than the home computer.like the product a lot.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	great price for a new ipad. ipads can do and be used for so many things now i don't know how i got along without one.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This ipad also came with a cover. Did not expect that, so bonus woohoo! Works great, looks great. Would recommend to everyone.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	After much debate and a slowly failing laptop I wanted something larger then my iPhone I could Internet research with and type short things with, iPad was on my list and I'm not crazy about getting the latest and greatest so I got this ipad2 used for less the. $300 score! Not a scratch on it and came in an original box so I couldn't ask for more	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Can't beat for the money, and very user friendly. We have tried cheaper tablets and I wish we would have purchased thr iPad first	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	She uses it all the time, I occasionally get a chance to use it, but not very often. I have to stick to my Kindle Fire?	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	I love my Ipad 2 - it came on time, VERY MINOR scratches (You would really have to look hard, to realize them), also came with the charger -(Does not come with the original box) but I really got a deal! And to add - the customer service with this seller was good as well. WAY TO GO! My son loves it..	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	when i bought it the price is really good and valuable. later on the price was increased. I was so lucky.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I resisted buying an iPad for a long time and finally broke down.  I wanted to get a used one first, just to make sure I would make full use of it, before going all in.  This item arrived quickly and in perfect condition. I'm very pleased with this seller.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I love my ipad. It works great and is perfect to take along anywhere I go. Great item love it!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I love my ipad. It has been the best thing I have bought in a long time. I am reallying enjoyning my purchase.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	No need for a brand new ipad when this one has everything plus a great price point. Works like a dream.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Ordered this refurbished iPad as a gift for a relative. Was shipped quickly. Not a scratch on it, and works like a charm! Came in original box with everything in package. Very happy with it.  :-)	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"This things been reviewed to death, so I won't talk about specs, capabilities, etc., but I wanted to tell a quick story of why I'll be using these things for as long as Apple make them. I got this when it first came out. I'm IT savvy(ish), and knew how to set the thing up. At the same time, I gave my Windows Netbook to my lovely mother :-)  It was her first time with a computer and it didn't go well. Now don't get me wrong, I love Windows and use it every day, but it's hard explaining to a 75 year old why you need security updates and a reboot, or why something is stuck in the Outbox, or many other occurrences.
Ultimately, I decided to upgrade to a newer iPad (go iPad Air!), and I took the Netbook from her, and gave her this instead. Sure, I set up a few things like email, etc. and had to tell her that ""Safari is now your Internet Explorer"", but then she was off!
The point is that these things are just so intuitive, that almost anyone can just work them out. For anyone thinking of getting someone older (or maybe even younger), into using the Net, etc., I can't recommend this enough."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	EXCELENTE PRODUCTO	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I love my iPad.  Previously I had a kindle fire which I loved also until I tried an iPad my wife brought home from her work...I was hooked.  Graphically it is far superior to the kindle fire in my opinion.  Absolutely love the fact that the calendar, photos, etc...will sync with my iPhone.  The available apps from Apple far exceed anything amazon has to offer.  I'm am a freelance graphic designer and love the amount of helpful design apps available on the apple store.  There is even one that allows me to open a file from my computer and edit designs for customers if I'm away from my desk.  The larger screen size in relation to the kindle fire makes this tablet even more appealing to me.  Don't get me wrong the fire is a good product, but with a kindle app on the iPad to make it a reader for your amazon books...who needs it.  Recommend this product any chance I get.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Since I finally understand how to use my iPhone, it was easy to learn how to use the iPad2.  This does not replace my laptop, but it has replaced my iPod.  Since its bigger than an iPod, I won't misplace it as often...and I can read it better!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I really didn't know if I would like an ipad, but my daughter, who lives 600 miles away wanted me to be able to FaceTime with the grand kids, so I decided to get mine second hand through Amazon. Everything has been great: shipping, the product, and the support.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	A big improvement for my company.  Will increase my business 100%. I am very pleased with merchandise.  Looks great on the stand.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	We surprised our grand kids at Christmas with these and they were ecstatic.  Beyond our needs, but who knows.....after seeing them put their iPad through its paces, we just may buy one for ourselves.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	We were skeptical about purchasing a refurbished product with such a high price tag because you never know what you're getting yourself into when you can't actually see what it is you're buying until it arrives.

Wow! She's crazy about this thing. She doesn't even use her laptop anymore. She's on this thing all the time. And it's constantly playing music -- good music even. And the sound is great, considering it's just a tablet. She uses it to skype with her family overseas, browse the web, do email, shopping, everything. She even brings it to bed and I have to say, ""Honey, can you please turn down the music? I'm trying to sleep."""	5	electronics

It is just the right size to fit into my shoulder bag and be large enough fo me to see the details on the screen.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I am having so much fun with this ipad!! It is amazing how much I can do on it. There is only one little wee tiny thing that makes me wonder about its volume function; when I am playing my music, I notice that the volume sometimes goes lower and then just as suddenly, it will come back up to the set volume. I don't know if that means anything is wrong but I hope not. I don't want anything to be wrong with this ipad as I really love using it. It also has the very best tunes for alarms, notices etc. So glad I bought it!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Wife sez, no I don't want one for Christmas, don't need an iPhone, an iPod, or an iPad. I said, okay, how about an iRon?  That annoyed her. So, I got her an iPad anyway.  Now she never talks to me, always on her iPad playing Candy Crush. Jeez, I've created a monster!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"If you are currently looking for an amazing product that is very reliable then you are looking at it right now. This Ipad 2 is very easy to use and can be used for almost anything. Whether you are at home and just want to play games or watch Netflix or if you are at school and want to take notes, this Ipad can do just about anything. Many people have consumed and reported their personal experiences and for the most part if you own an Ipad 2 you cooler than everyone else who doesnt own one. People will look at you at work or in class and envy you since they don't have one. That is a fact! I encourage everyone to own one of these. It is a purchase I do not regret and I would recommend it to anyone. My whole family owns one from my sister to my cousins and nephews and we are all satisfied with the Ipad 2. It works as a mini computer on the go and you will love it.
 This item is fun to use and is very appealing. The size and weight of it allows you to be able to take anywhere with you. It is much thinner and it has been created to be much faster than other tablets. You will not have to wait for 10 minutes to allow it to turn on , you will be guaranteed fast service from this apple product. There are also multiple languages from which you can choose from to The display of the Ipad is just phenomenal. Its glossy widescreen allows you to see everything very nicely. Theres no doubt the resolution quality is the best! You would want to take pictures and videos everywhere you go. This Ipad has also been created with front and rear cameras so you don't have to only take pictures of others but you can take pictures of yourself. How awesome! So if you and your friend want to take a picture but there is no one around that can do you the favor, there is no need to worry about it because you have this ipad. Adjust the camera to face you and snap away. You can also fix the picture by adding filters or purchasing apps that allow you to fix a picture in anyway whether its adjusting the color and brightness or adding funny stickers or borders. There are thousands of apps you can find that are fun and very useful. Many apps you must pay for but they are usually very cheap and definitely worth it. There are also many free apps that are your usual apps. The app store has thousands of apps specifically for ipads. This allows you to have an enjoyable time when using your ipad. When purchasing your ipad, your item comes with free built in apps. These apps include the camera, calendar, clock, safari and many more general apps you need on a everyday basis. Surfing the web on your Ipad can not get any easier. It was created so that everyone can easily learn from your 4 year old sister to your 70 year old grandmother. The buttons on the exterior of the ipad include the home, volume, and silence key and the hold button. The power and battery life of the ipad is excellent. You can go hours of surfing the web or playing games without having to keep charging it everyday.  For example, I recently went on a trip to San Francisco which took 6 hours. I watched movies on the way there and movies on the way back and didn't have to chrage it during my vacation. It was amazing to be able to use it for so long and not have to keep charging it on my trip. On my trip I was also able to factime my brother who was back at home. With the ipad you can videochat and factime anyone at anytime as long as you have wifi. This allows you to have contact with someone you haven't seen for a while. It allows you to be able to see someone while talking to them at the same time. This for me is the best part of the ipad since It clearly allows me to see my brother who lives far away from me. The Apple Ipad 2 is an excellent product overall. If you are still debating whether or not to purchase an Ipad 2 you should go and play with one hands on first before purchasing. You can go to best buy or an Apple store to witness this marvelous item in action. I give the Ipad 2 five stars because I love it. It is very reliable for anything and the design of it makes it easy to use anywhere you go!"	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	This product was a perfect gift for my father, an inexperienced apple user. Just enough memory to dowload apps specific to him, internet by phone or wifi capabilities...email, texting. Dad is 87 and having a blast reading newspapers, playing games and emailing all the family from anywhere. He was a bit intimidated at first, but loves it after just a couple of lessons.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	My Son loves it he uses it all the time. If he's not using it my grand daughter who is two is.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	Probably the last person in the world to get an ipad but I could not be happier with it. It helped me pass the time while staying at the hospital one night with a family member.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Now really, is there any other electronic tablet that an Apple Ipad? I have tried others, My sister even bought brand X and sent it back...  APPLE heads above all the rest...	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"My family bought this for my mother and she loves it. Opens a whole new world. She has not use for the 32 or 64 version. 16 is enough. I have the 64 version and haven't even used enough memory for 16.
Also bought a Brookstone keyboard and case, as I don't like typing on the keyboard inside the Ipad 2. Just a thought."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I use my iPad for my banking needs, calendar all my appointments, watch tv & movies, play games, read books, journaling, Bible study, there is nothing I found that it can't do.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Having a MacBook Pro and an iPhone I didn't think an iPad would be an item I would end up loving. I find myself grabbing my iPad over my laptop while at home, and while at work I find myself wishing I had my iPad on breaks when I'm stuck with my phone.

Really great product, wish it had a flash to go along with the great camera. Other than that it's a fantastic product."	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	I bought this for a portable telepromter kit for my video business.  I have had no issues with it at all.  Apple products are pretty solid and easy to use. They can be pricey but refurbs and used are the way to go in my opinion. Chances of getting a dud are slim.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	My first purchase of a used item.  Great value, true to how it was represented.  Purchased as a gift and the recipient is really enjoying it.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I'll mix it up a little and start with the things I don't like about the iPad 2. I sold my iPad 2 a while back, but I now have an iPad 3 and iPad Air. 4 iPhones, and an iMac.  On the other side of the fence I own a Kindle Fire HDX 7"", and did own a 7"" Lenovo tablet, both of which I like also.  Obviously the only draw-back I can think of with the iPad 2 is the poor resolution, which probably isn't even that big of a deal to some people. To me it's a deal breaker, and that is why I sold my iPad 2, however when I got the iPad 3 and realized how much heavier it was, I actually kind of regretted getting rid of my older version!  I absolutely love the light weight of the 2, ALMOST as much as I love the Retina display of the successive models.  I honestly can't tell any real difference in the speed of the 2, vs. the 3, vs even the Air! I guess I'm not all that much into games anymore, which is probably the only place the upgraded power and speed of the newer iPads would ever come in to play anyway!

  As I mentioned before, the Retina display to me is a very worthwhile tradeoff even for a heavier iPad.  I actually prefer my iPad w/ Retina and keyboard case to a much more expensive Mac book Air, without Retina display. The reason being, no matter how close you set the iPad to your eyes (such as laying in bed with it sitting on your chest, the clarity is just like reading printed material right out of a book, and to me that's more important than a big screen any day of the week! I much prefer the new fire wire charging cables over the 32 pin one that the iPad 2, android tablets, and other phones use.  I hate having to worry about which side is supposed to be up or down...

  The reason I would go with an iPad 2 over any of the other Android tablets, including the Kindle Fire, even though probably all the android tablets have far superior hardware for the same amount of money, is that iEnvironment. iOS, iTunes, iCloud, better quality apps, even from the exact same software on iOS vs. Android.  Owning something from Apple is not about a status symbol or anything like that for me, to me it's like owning a piece of art that makes my heart go pitter-pat every time I pick one up or sit down to relax with one on my chest.  My satisfaction and joy of owning and using such device with such a OS and compatibility with everything in my book is well worth the extra money that Apple charges for their devices.  I'm also very proud to support an American company, versus a Chinese or Korean one... sorry, but do you haters even stop to think that all the Chinese and Korean equipment use poorly paid and poorly cared for cheap labor in China just like Apple does... duh!"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Even though it didn't come with anything, works great! Daughter hasn't put it down since she got it for Christmas! Thanks!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I appreciate how the seller described how it was used, and even said where there was a tiny scratch. I have an iPhone and a desktop Mac computer already, so I actually wanted the larger screen of the iPad 2, so I could use it more as a laptop.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Thanks I got this for my daughter for Christmas because she was always on my PC she loves it thanks	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The Ipad 2 was flawless, arrived on time, and is working great. KDH did a great job and exceeded my expectations for used electronics. I recommend you give KDH a look before you buy from anyone else.	5	electronics

The seller threw in an Apple smart cover, and a car charger as well-VERY NICE! Thank you so much for the great product and super customer service!!	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	Apple, and games for the kids, but work apps for Mom ! Actually this is our 4 th in the family. They are all running strong, and used every day by each of us. This is the 3G one, which you only need if you are away from home alot.  For the kids it is great that Apple has the super prices also without the 3/4G. They only need to be using them at home, so that is an option to remember. A lifesaver iPads are!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Nice...
iPad itself is a nice product.
iOS 7 uploaded and is as good as the latest version for me...."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	simply the best for it time and all times, never been disappointed, work like a swiss watch, takes a lickin and keeps on ticken.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	The iPad 2 works great!  No problems at all!  I give it 5 stars!  I know others who have bought new and have problems.  We are very happy with our purchase!  Thank you!	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"Arrived very quickly !!!! This is a Christmas gift for my mom in Texas --- can't wait for her to open it - she will love it!!
Was in immaculate shape ---- like brand new in the original box with the power plugs"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The ipad actually arrived looking like it had just come off the line it was in such good condition. It has a screen protector so that meant no scratches on it and one almost invisible scratch on one corner of the case. Expected more wear and tear that I actually got from this item. I was glad to get it so cheap for my son because I refuse to pay full retail for a 9 year old.....	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I was considering a new iPad 2 but purchased this item instead.  This iPad 2 looks and performs like new without any concerns whatsoever.  A great product!!	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	Not only did it come with a case and charger, I got it in less then a week and it's description was correct. thank you so much	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This iPad is working great.  Thought I was having trouble with it.  Turned out the problem was with my wireless router.  I upgraded my router and all worked well.  It takes more throughput to run the iPad than to run my laptop, so the it took me a while to troubleshoot since I was still using my laptop wirelessly every day.  I would reset the general settings on iPad, and it would be able to connect to the internet for a bit.  There was an update that I needed, but it crashed the whole thing every time I tried to download it.  Bought a new modem/wireless router at Officemax, hooked all up, and everything is working great!  (Obviously I don't have a contract with AT&T yet)	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I'm very pleased with the purchase of my iPad. I did have to return the first one because of a scratch on the screen but as soon as I contacted the vendor they took care of having it returned and shipped the replacement out quickly. They took care of everything and were very nice to communicate with during the process. Seeing as how these are used units and they were so helpful to make sure I was 100% satisfied with my purchase I highly recommend KDH Electronics as your preferred supplier when purchasing electronics.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I absolutely LOVE my iPad!! No complaints. My purpose for buying it was to do my vlogging on it. But it serves many purposes in my household. It's my toy and to keep my kids (9&3) OFF I bought them their own tablets! Lol I love it and until it dies I won't be upgrading	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Just have to say WOW! I am so impressed with this iPad and company. Screen was perfect and customer service was excellent. Quick response. Loaded the iPad and all seems to work very well. THANK YOU!	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	Because my grandson loved it. I love it because it is easy to learn, and it has parental controls and I don't have to worry about him. He is 11.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Why spend so much more money when you can get an excellent iPad that runs the same software for hundreds less.  No, it does not have retina, but this is an excellent piece.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Nice product. Works fine, unfortunately, does not allow for WLAN hotspot function. Would buy it again. My mother is happy. Delivery was perfect.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	I was wary to purchase a used IPad but this one has been AMAZING!!! I am so extremely happy with it, there are not enough words to explain my happiness!  Thank you so much for a good product and even better experience!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This was a gift for my wife, she loves it	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Apple has a good product. This is very light weight. It is a christmas present for my pre teen daughter. They use the I pad 2 for school which she never puts down when she comes home from school, playing games she has put on it. This one is lighter and skinnier than the one she uses for school, I just need to buy accessories to protect it  and a stand.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"The iPad 2 is simply amazing. Think about it, even when the iPad Air came out, they are still selling the iPad 2.

It's almost as if its like the iPod Classic, where something so good always gets sold.  I'm writing this review even after they have the retina, blah blah. my ipad 2 still provided as much use as it did on day 1, and i will continue to use it everyday."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This iPad is fantastic. Like all of Apple's products, it delivers a really beautiful experience. We use this iPad to stream Songza to our bluetooth speaker, view recipes in the kitchen, read magazines, books, and newspapers. It offers everything and works beautifully. I really recommend this iPad if you want to buy one without paying for the latest version.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Pavilion  Electronics delivers!!! I ordered a ""used"" Apple iPad 2 for a Christmas gift for my 80-something Dad.

I will order from them again in the future, for sure!"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"We were hesitant to buy ""used"" however we have had very good luck with everything using this iPad. Hooked it up to 3G and it works great. Perfect for beginner iPad users who didn't want to commit to the cost of brand new. Shipping was super speedy as well!"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Bought this for my husband, he loves his iPad and uses it daily! There are so many free apps you can get and even more if you want to pay for them!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"My son is really going to love this iPad. I purchased it for him for Christmas. For anyone on the fence about purchasing a refurb, don't worry. I am very happy with this one, and I know my son and I will get lots of use out of this fantastic product!

UPDATE: Just checking back in to report that we are still very happy with this seller and this iPad. It is incredible! Our son still loves it and has had no problems with it all. Would come back to this seller to purchase again if we need to get another one."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Love this!  Almost excellent condition - one tiny scratch on the back. Received order in FOUR days without adding extra for expedited shipping. I would definitely recommend this seller. Wanted an iPad for a while, didn't think I could afford $600+, this was a great price and is exactly what I wanted. Thank you.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I love my Ipad 2, Apple created the market and they have the best products out there in my opinion.  The device is a little on the heavy side but the way form meets function is beautifully done and apps are the best out there.  Apple devices are more expensive than other tablets but you really get what you pay for...you are going to be spending a lot of time on your tablet so choose wisely.

A word of advice, if you have small children who will be using this device make sure that you get an Otterbox Defender case.  They will drop it, spill food on it, etc...and the Otterbox case will save you from sending your device back to Apple and forking over $250 for them to fix it"	5	electronics

I opened the package and found the ipad 2 in great condition and it even had the original box.  I was delighted to see that it came with a charger as well. It seemed that some of the ipads did not come with a charger or even a box. It came with new glass and they even updated the software to the 7.0.3 os. I was expecting to have to update myself. They even gave me a brand new magnetic cover for it.  I'm very happy with the seller and will buy from them again.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	I use it every day.  Great for travel.  Don't need to take it out to go through security.  Picture quality is very good.  Battery charge life is phenomenal.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I have been using my smartphone for applications which are much better suited for a tablet, and Apple certainly has an excellent product.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I found you product was great and fast handing with all the shipment thanks for and I like at so much that's why I recommend my friends and family	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"This model came out in March 2011, and me and 3 other family members have had one since June 2011.
Despite the age of the model it has not become obsolescent like many other gadgets. It runs the latest IOS 7 and apps perfectly. The battery still holds a full charge, and all of the buttons and features still work (I could not say the same about my 4 year old Ipod Touch...).
I use it primarily for web browsing, email, Facetime and e-books.
This model does NOT have a retina display. Although Retina is nice it makes no difference in day to day use, including viewing photos. So what if I can see dots close up? I am certainly not bothered by them.
Sure its fun having the most up to date toy, but having the new Ipad Air would not enhance the enjoyment that I get from the device one bit.
Still, it seems like chutzpah for Apple to sell an old model for $400, so if I were in the market, I would look at used/refurbished models. The device is very well built and reliable so I wouldn't worry about getting a used one in good condition."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I bought this for traveling purposes, so i don't have to take along my rather large lap top computer. I ended up buying the carrying case that has the keyboard attached to it as well as the protection screen.  Works great!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I just love my ipad 2 - with all of the cool apps and music - nice!!!  Easy to use and portable	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Buying refurbished can be a little scary, but I was very impressed with the condition of this product. The few scratches were exactly as they had been described, nothing more. And it functions as if it were new. Thank you for a great product and quick turn around!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Just love this new Ipad first one I ever owned. Still figuring out all it can do. Like having the ability to access everything I need in one place.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	My refurbished iPad seems to work just fine. The rate I paid for it makes it almost disposable.  It's Excellent!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This was a gift for my husband. I was so afraid it may be a bad purchase, but turned out really good working item.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This was a used item but it was just like new with the exception of a very small scratch on the back.. otherwise, looks and works perfect.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Love it.the price was right.it came in like new condition . I was glad to see it at my house as soon as I did.ths for the fast service!,,	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	My husband received it and really liked it.  The images are clear and it navigates fast.  Highly recommend it.  Thanks	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	It is fun to use and performs just as I would expect it to.  The screen is easy to see, and is simple to use. There are many free apps that are available from the app store which makes it easy to get started using it.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The IPad was in even better condition than the seller mentioned. Also included was a case that is in perfect condition. My granddaughter is now the proud owner of the IPad (a birthday gift) and we hope to have many happy facetime conversations on our IPads!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Even though It's an older IPAD, IPAD 2 has everything you need, to get the job done, and with the 64 GB of storage, you can't beat that.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I love it.. Got an app for my music lyrics..turns it into a teleprompter.. Bought it mainly for books.. But now i use it for almost everything.. Versatile!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I love it. It's my life line. Worked perfectly when I got it with nearly no damage.  Just a small scratch	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I don't know what I ever did without it.  I use it everyday withput fail.  Mostly for mail, books and games.  It's a handy little think that is easy to take along.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This iPad is a much more cost effective choice for those that want the quality of a Mac product but don't necessarily need all the new bells and whistles. I have had no problem updating the O/S and running whatever apps I want on this one as opposed to running the same apps on the latest iPad.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I've had my IPAD 2 for the last two  years and it was been extremely useful for traveling.  I would recommend for all.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I love this IPAD. It is an excellent and reasonable. I would order this same product again. I recommend this product to others.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I am true believer in apple products. I have never been disappointed. I did buy it refurbished and it works great. And have recently purchased another used iPad. And it is updated to the new ISO 7 and it's great.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I can go on and on, but basically it does everything I need it to do. I do all of my studies on it, research, games, face time with distant family. Fast shipping! All around happy!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	We bought this to use with a sound board and it works very well. To be able to control our sound system from anywhere in the sanctuary is excellent.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Received the iPad 2 it was in great shape it shipped well and I now trouble with starting it up and running it on the first try (after plugging in the battery and charging it of course).	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	After I finally got the Verizon 3G account straightened out, I really like it. It was a mess getting it straightened out though, because the previous owner needed to take their name off the account. Which neither of us new that to begin with. All is well now.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I love it it just was not the right choice for my grand daughter. Her father had already purchased one for her birthday.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I got this iPad in October 2011, according to the engraving on the back, and since 2 years seems to be the extent of most gadgets' life these days, I simply had to make a review. A good one, of course.

PROS:

Weight: By far, the most amazing thing about this tablet is that it weighs so little. I believe it weighs less than any other iPad out there, which is weird, but I think the iPad mini is supposed to cater to those who have a problem with that. The iPad isn't meant to be held in one hand, though. It's a real personal computer, only in tablet from, and you must treat it as such. If you need to be able to read in bed or something, get a kindle or iPad mini. However, you'll find that the iPad is very convenient for most uses.

Design: The front of the iPad is defined by a single pane of multitouch glass - and a home button. The back is made of aluminum. There is a front camera, a rear camera in the top right corner, and a speaker at the bottom. This simplistic design, which Apple litigiously fought for against Samsung, is in a word, magical. I'm not too much into the marketing stuff, but seriously, there is something extremely premium about Apple products, and I am sure it is more than the pseudo philosophical marketing. The Smart Cover actually works really well, though its necessity is... debatable. Overall, this tablet feels like its worth 500 dollars. Ok, so it's 400 now, but you know what I mean.

Durability: The primary user of this tablet is an unhygienic now-9-year-old who is not exactly dexterous and immediately gets on it after school, sin lavar sus manos. If you know glass, you know that the only thing that can really scratch it are minerals. That's right. Not knives or cleats, though they may if you try hard enough. It's finger salts, salt from food, dust, dirt, sand, jewelry like diamonds and quartz. However, today I wiped off all the prints with a damp hand towel and I could count, I kid you not, 3 micro scratches. That's amazing. This tablet has been dropped, probably not from extreme heights, but still. The glass at the corners, along with the aluminum housing, is tattered. There are several deep scratches in the aluminum on the back. However, there are no functional damages to this tablet. That's also very nice. You probably don't need the Smart Cover for its protective aspect. You will however, want it so you can use it for support. It helps a lot.

Display: Eek. I'll kick it to you straight; the resolution of this screen is terrible. If your going to be looking at pictures, you're going to be disappointed. 1024x768 doesn't cut it. My 4.5 inch S2 had a resolution of 800x640. I thought it was sub par, but acceptable. The iPad is just bleh. It's colors are amazing though. I don't know too much about outdoor performance, but I've never felt that brightness was an issue, so it's probably ok. What the iPad lacks in detail more than makes up in size. Laying down in bed with a ten inch screen feels so empowering. I feel like I have all the media in the world in my hands, and I almost do.

Apps: I don't use my iPad for work. It stays at home most of the time, and at home, I have my desktop. I would assume it would be pretty easy to use iWork to create, but I wouldn't know. *flame alert* I believe Android is better for smartphones, and iOS for tablets. There is a serious lack of tablet apps for android, but I am continually surprised at the growing iOS tablet app ecosystem. However, there are a greater variety of apps on Android, in my experience. The iPad can actually handle games pretty well, despite its age. That all I really need to say. There isn't any calculator or weather or stocks app, but you'll find great alternatives in the App Store.

Camera: Why are you reading this? What are you doing with your life? Why would you want to use the iPad's camera for anything except FaceTime? Seriously? Well, that's all you're going to be able to do, because the cameras on the 2 are terrible. Really. I would expect more for 500 bucks, but whatever. It's not a priority. If you ever find yourself in so dire a situation that you need to use the iPad camera, you better invest in a disposable, or something.

Battery life: Ho ho. Tee hee. The battery life of the 2 makes me want to giggle. Even 2 years later, the battery life still feels virtually infinite. I can almost guarantee you, you will never have a problem with the iPads battery life. This is because if the square cube principle. The surface area (screen size) increases at rate of the dimensions, squared. The volume, cubed. More volume means more battery. So, theoretically, the bigger the device, the longer the battery life. Oh, and iOS is super efficient, almost forgot that.

Performance: Welp, iOS7 is here. Anybody with anything older than 2012 must upgrade to escape the lag! Not so. Though the animations in iOS7 are super slow and can induce ""motion sickness"", the iPad 2 handles it pretty well. (I swear, auto correct has something against the word we'll.) The gaming isn't bad for such an old device, though I have yet to try out newer games like asphalt 8. However, you'll be able to stream video (not in hd, of course!) and play 2d games  with no hitches. The keyboard does sometimes take a while to pop up and apps do take somewhat longer to load, but hey, we're talking about an old geezer tablet here.

Features: I haven't been able to use Bluetooth to transfer files yet, presumably because Apple wants me to upgrade and use AirDrop. Classic Apple. And I'm pretty sure Siri could easily run on the 2. Oh well, looks like we're stuck with... The two doesn't have any gimmicks, per se, to it. It has the dual cameras, but that's about it. There is nothing to show off. Just to experience. FaceTime is great, though. Like, wow. It's really the best video chat technology I've ever seen. If nothing else, I would commend apple on its FaceTime infrastructure. It's simple and fun and convenient, not to mention powerful.

Overall: Even after 2 years of not so nice treatment, my 2 is functionally perfect. It really feels amazing to be able to consume content on such a big screen. The thinness and lightness of the device make it disappear as you're using it. FaceTime really is the best interpersonal video chat platform as of today. IOS 7 runs fine on this, but don't expect to be so lucky next year. I was actually shocked to see the price here on Amazon. Really? 400 bucks for a 2011 tablet? When the 5 is just around the corner and will cost only 100 more? Only a fool would buy it now. However, the 2 really bolstered the image of Apple I had. I have a first gen Nano that actually still works for a whole day! I would expect the iPad to do the same. This review isn't recommending that you buy the 2. All I'm saying is that Apple makes the best tablets out there. Even the most hardcore Android fanatic (which I am dangerously close to) could agree on some levels. iPads are feat for consuming content. Maybe even for creating. However, if you want to get real work done, you're going to want to wait for the next generation of windows 8 pro tablets with Broadwell Chips in them. I need an IDE to be able to do programming when I go to college, and the fact that no such software is available for iOS means that I can't take this there. The iPad isn't a complete replacement for a real computer. But it comes pretty darn close.

B0013FRNKG	"I purchased this for my 3 year old son as an upgrade to his ipad 1. He has been very proficient at using ipad from a very early age. itunes store has a huge selection of learning apps for his age group and younger. My son has been a ipad and ipod user sinc he was about 9 months old, he thinks he is playing, but he is really learning. He is way ahead of where he should be and he has had a ton of fun doing it. After ios 6&7 came out his ipad 1  was no longer able to keep up with the technology of the upgraded apps. I purchased the 64g ipad 2 so he would have plenty of room for his apps since some of the apps can be large downloads. i am able to also to limit what he is able to do in settings and the app store. He can only get apps ifi unlock it. ipad 2 was easy to child lock certain features and content. ipad 2's long battery is great on trips, it keeps him busy and i don't need active wifi for his apps to work. I wish that ipad existed with my other children. I like that he is learning on current to future technology that most daycares or preschools can not provide.  I recommend this to any parent. The ecpense is worth it. A childs education id priceless. ipad 2 is perfect for facilitating that.

B0013FRNKG	"My first iPad.  When I opened the box it looked brand new, and contained the cords as advertised.  About a week later I took a good look at it at an angle and noticed some slight scratches around the edges, but by then they could have been mine.  Great buy as ""used"" product.  And I love it, have not used my desktop computer since (and my laptop died which is why I got this).  Everything from my iPod touch was automatically loaded on startup, just had to turn it on.  I have used it constantly - email, surfing, twitter, Words...  Much easier to use than laptop, handy to take room to room, easier to use lounging on sofa, reading in bed, etc.  I love it."	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	I recently bought a Windows version of a tablet and it was so horrible It was virtually unusable. So I turned it in for this iPad and I love. It actually works!

B0013FRNKG	I absolutely love this iPad. I was thinking about buying it directly from apple at first. Then I thought getting the one with retina display but heard it wasn't worth it. So I decided to go with the iPad 2. It has been great already. It was used and has 2 small scratches on the back. No big deal. Simple wear and tear. I definitely recommend this. It was shipped immediately and received right on time.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	About two years ago, my now husband gave me an Ipad 2 for my birthday and it has been great. For easy access to your email, reading, downloading photos, working in the kitchen, quick searches, you name it, I go to my Ipad. So, this year, brainstorming about a nice, affordable gift for my husband who was going away on a trip to celebrate, the Ipad came up as a great choice. It allows him to do everything he would have to do on his computer while away, but on a much practical, easy to carry around, cool gadget.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This item was just what I expected.  It came within the time frame that was advertised.  It was in perfect condition.  No issues whatsoever.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I have had no problems or issues with this item and, while there was some very minor damage to one corner on the pad, the cost paid as compared to a new unit was just unbelievable. Also with no shipping charges. I will be using  Amazon for most, if noy all, fugure purchases.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I bought this for the wife. She loves it. She uses it for games, facebook, mail, internet, and face to face time. Many of our friends and relatives also have.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	We absolutely love our new iPad!  When it first arrived we were concerned that it didn't come with directions.  After turning it on, I soon realized why there is no need.  SUPER EASY TO USE!!  We purchased the iPad because we were taking a trip and thought it would help us navagate around town. It was amazing!  We not only used it for driving directions, but, to help us find great places to eat close by and it was our music as well. I highly recommmend this product!!!  I don't know how we ever got along without it!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Really only a few Knicks and scratches around the edges of the Ipad. Works great, you wouldn't know it was used at all. I love the Smart cover it came with. Even though it was still out of my price range, I don't think I could've found a better deal than this.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	My first ipad.  Love it. Still not totally familiar with all the ins and outs, but really great addition to our electronics	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	So I moved a patio table this last summer and failed to move my father-in-laws iPad, which fell off and broke.  Got on my Pad and ordered this one, Amazon was great, it was at his door before he got home from this vacation.  Just like is older model, so good deal.  Next time move the iPad not the coffee cup.  Thank you Amazon.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"I got an iPad 2 a while ago. It's a great choice for anyone.
It has pretty much the same features as an ipad 3 or 4, except for the fact that the screen in the 3 and 4 are much better (who cares really?) the ipad 2 screen is also beautiful :)
The ipad 3 4 have The new charging cable . the iPad 2 doesn't.  i don't see how that makes a difference. also the ipad 3 amd 4 have Siri. But if you don't plan on using Siri alot, the ipad 2 is perfect :
Im writing this review on my iPad. :) It's great!"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Our family fights over it!  It is so easy to take along wherever I go.  I can stay in touch with my e-mails and friends since I don't have a fancy phone.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	I have an Applie mini ipad and purchased this larger size for my husband who does not have to pack it around in a purse.  He likes the larger screen and the quick responsiveness of the Apple product.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I bought this for my daughter. You can't go wrong with Apple products. The IPads are a wonderful device for anything. We use it to FaceTime each other. Pictures are crystal clear! A definite win!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Had a little problem when fedex did not deliver on time.  Custimer service stepped in and took care of it immediately.  I was very impressed with the professionalism they extended.

The I pad itself is great.  I have not had it very long but so far I have found it very user friendly and I am still exploring all he functions  I would highly recommend his product and this seller,"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	best ipad 2 i love it it was cheap i love it i got it one for my mom and then i bought awesome iPad i recommend it	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Best thing I have bought in a long time. Love it. Had one with less memory which was full so I upgraded.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Beautiful IPad after receiving the iPad I just purchased a second iPad . I'll will seek you out for more as my company grows	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I have resisted getting a tablet for years. As others have observed, a computer without a real keyboard is weighted toward content consumption rather than content creation (otherwise known as work). To fill the need for a lightweight, long battery life, zero fan/vent portable, I had purchased a Chromeook. Frankly, after the novelty wore off, it was sitting in the drawer more than on my lap.

Well a month or so ago, on a whim I got the iPad 2. Within 24 hours of playing with it and discovering both powerful productivity (like aTimelogger and DayOne) and music apps (such as Synthesia, Garage Band) that fill voids in what I've seen as an owner of an Android phone, I became a devoted member of the iPad cult. From there, I tested several keyboards and have settled on the Kensington Ultimate and Logic Fabricskin.

Now, after month downrange, it smile on my face hasn't worn off -- the iPad and I are inseparable. It is really an integral part of my life and work.

I will probably sell the Chromebook on eBay. This will be the first of many iPads to come as they come out with newer versions."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	all is good i like it i will buy again from this seller. good delivery well timed also material good and as described. also well seal an protected.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I finally got one after waiting for so long and I love it. Everything I used to do on my computer, (check email, shopping, etc.) I want to do all those things on this iPad all the time now. It's fast, responsive, has pretty much everything you could think of table-wise. I'm going to have this for while, I know that much.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I love my iPad 2.  I really do.  I bought it for college, and so far I can do everything from read textbooks to take notes to stay in touch with my family, all on one device.  I know there are a lot of arguments about Android vs. iOS.  Personally, I prefer iOS because it is a very simple interface and I don't need a lot of customization.  If you like to change every single aspect from the background to the icons, etc, then you might prefer a different OS.  But for me, this is perfect.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Everthing was delived in a peofessional manner like new. I loved it and I am have great fun with it	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"This iPad came without a mark on it.  You'd be hard pressed to tell that it is used.  My son loves it, especially for the price (as he bought it himself).  Now both my daughters are saving to buy themselves an iPad as well.  I was a little skeptical buying a used iPad, but getting it for nearly half the price was worth trying it (30 day warranty sealed the deal).

Better than buying on Craigslist, as you can actually return these as long as it's within the 30 day window."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Apple has created a fine product here, user friendly, easy to use, very nice for movies and stuff. App Store is extensive and many top apps are only available on the AppStore.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	All Apple products are of high quality but very, very expensive. Why they do not discount them; a lot of people will buy them; I will be one of them	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This ipad is wonderful. My daughter and I enjoy viewing movies, taking pictures and videos with it. It has not disappointed as I was with the 2 tablets I returned. Although this is a used ipad, it is so much better than the tablets we purchased new.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I love this iPad, great condition exactly as described it looks almost new it came in its original box and accessories	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I love my Ipad if you do not have one I recommend buying one it is my computer on the go or more like entertainment for the kids that I can put new media on everyday and they love it	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	It was her Christmas gift and may have replaced me!  Our son has a 2 and a 3, and recommended the 2 for her.  She really loves it and it was the best price I could find.  We got the extended warranty thru Sq. Trade.  Have not needed it yet.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Had an I phone 4 and now a 5. I am still learning all the iPads capabilities but the two have worked together very well. Like most Apple products intuitive and easy to use. I love it but so far to me its just a large extension of the I phone.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I love this ipad its in really good condition for a great price 64gb Ipad 2 I really like it!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	My first apple product. Having a hard time getting use to the new lingo, but so far it good . I don't like the review thing	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	I travel a lot and bought this to keep up with my business and website while I'm away. I was not only able to purchase what I needed for an upcoming wedding for a client, but also did my online backing as well. I haven't found much that can't be done with an iPad.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	love it perfect condition for what I paid and would recommend for other customers, buy it you won't be let down	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Title says it all... but apparently I need 12 more words.  We love our new Ipad, it has brought lots of fun gaming to our household.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I bought this a while ago and just realized I didn't leave a review.  I have loved the ipad.  I have hundreds of apps loaded and have had no issues.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I must admit when it comes to purchasing ""used"" products it can be a scary process.  You don't know if the seller is ""inflating"" the qualities of the product and the product really is a peice of trash.  Well I can honestly say that isn't the case with this ipad 2 that I purchased from this seller.  This ipad 2 has been great so far, and I am totally pleased with it.  I would definitely buy other items in the future from this seller.  In fact, it is almost impossible to tell that this ipad 2 was not brand new to begin with.  I hope who ever is reading this and is thinking about taking a chance of buying anything from this seller to go for it...I know you won't be disappointed! :D"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	just got it yesterday and despite the fact that it was pre-owned, the ipad was in really good conditions. came with everything as described and set up was a breeze.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	Completely met my expectations!!!!  Best experience yet.  Delivery was on time and the product was in perfect shape.  My son is on it everyday.  Thank you!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I upgraded from the first generation iPad because it started to run slowly...  I guess that's what you get when you order refurbished...  However, I didn't want to spend the money on the brand new generation iPad, but I still wanted one that would run fast enough and still had the camera. I absolutely LOVE my iPad.  I have taken it on every trip because it is the perfect size to fit into your purse. :)	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This iPad is fantastic! But the battery life is not as good as I expected. Just playing a game for ten minutes runs the battery life down 5%, but it does take less time to charge than the one with retina display. I know a person who has the ipad wth rd, and I don't see much diff. between the A-5 and the  A-6 chip. but the battery gets really hot on the one with rd. I would not spend 150 extra dollars for tretina disply, A-6 chip, and longer battery life, and siri, when this is really good. I love my ipad 2.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Bought for husband. He is more than thrilled. I think the description said minor scratches on back and you could barely see them. Took 2wks in shipping though. Everything works great. Great product. Really good price.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The I-Pad 2 is wonderful. It come in very handy and fast. I'm actully thinking about buying a second one for my daughter.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Just what my husband needed. I bought it for him because he is on the road a lot and it was hard to see all the pictures and video's of our Grandchildren on his iPhone. He just loves it for that and of course the other uses, but the Grandkids are the most important thing, LOL!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I love my Ipad.  I use it often for the internet, games and videos.  Although I've had it for close to one year, I am still learning all the features on it.  I enjoy traveling with it and hope to use it on my next trip out of the country.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Excellent ipad2 so many apps for it and it is so nice to have something to take with me. Great graphics and very easy to use.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	it does what it does. it is not the latest of units, but it is well designed. geat for reading text. I use it for reading music & writing notes.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Wow I debated on an iPad for so long! I had a really small laptop but I always dreamed of an iPad. I finally took the plunge and would never give it back. Yes, it is pricy but is so worth it!! I mainly use mine for Facebook, shopping, Internet banking, and playing candy crush. It is a great convenience to just turn it on and start using. No worrying about loading or starting up. The picture is hd and crystal clear. If you need a keyboard they make Bluetooth ones. I would buy a newer one but mine is still going great !	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Good product. Wish it were a little cheaper and didn't have a few aviation bugs. this is dumb, so here are the extra words to get me out of this.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	this is my first ipad but I love the light weight easy to use and the charge lasts. I am not an all day web person but I have been using it more with the ipad	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I love it, thank you Amazon for this expensive IPad for that low price!!!!!! I brought it used, and it doesn't have any problems whatsoever, no fixing, works properly, it's 100% securely positive, love it!!!!!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Great price, speedy delivery and I can run games like KOTOR on it smoothly and beautifully. One of my favorite features though is the origami style slide show of all your pictures so it can be displayed when not in use as a picture frame.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	It has worked perfectly.  It has done all that I have asked of it. Great bargain for the price.  I  would recommend this to a friend.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	We already have a mini, and have been very happy with it, but my husband wanted something 3G capable and a little bigger for playing movies and handling documents when he travels. Despite the initial warning that the item was backordered, I received mine less than 10 days after my order!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The Ipad came exactly has it was posted.  I would recommend this product to everyone that was interested in buying one.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	I was looking for an ipad 2. After comparing features and battery life this model suited me best. Finding a good price on a brand new in the box took awhile but finally I found this one and I am enjoying using this ipad 2 for 3 to 4 days without having to recharge it.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	It's an iPad! How much more praise can I give it, there will be another one bought to replace an old gen one which will probably go to my grand daughter.	5	electronics

If you have the money to spend on it, I recommend it!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	There are several positive things to be said. First Hi-Tech Deals got my order to me quickly. Second, the iPad2 works great. Third, The case that was sent with it was a nice extra. Fourth, the iPad 2 works great except for its inability to stay on the WiFi. After doing some research I found out the problem is not the iPad but the new Apple 6.x update for the iPad2.  (Warning to owners of iPads, be careful of Apples new 6.x update as it does not help like it should) Otherwise I am very happy with the tablet and am having great time learning how to run it.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I take my iPad everywhere. I don't know how I went so long without it! I love it and will continue using iPads for a long time	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	I have been an owner of an Apple iPad 2 (64GB AT&T 3G) since the date of it's first released in the US on March 11, 2011. After more than two years of heavy use both personally and professionally I can say the Apple iPad changed my life. It is without a doubt one of the most innovative, useful, and powerful products on the market. That was true in April of 2010 when Apple released the first iPad, and it remains true to this day. An unimaginable number of iPad reviews exist online, so I will not restate the specs or the seemingly endless uses and applications. I will simply state that I have never regretted my purchase of my iPad for one second and I have found it to be one of the most versatile, useful, and simple pieces of technology I have ever owned. It's multipurpose functionality cannot be overstated. I cannot speak highly enough of the Apple iPad - and look forward to the day when I can upgrade to the latest model. Even so, my iPad 2 continues to be fully functional, fast, and sturdy. Why wait - BUY APPLE!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I bought several things on the web, things that were considered ""NEW"" and actually they weren't.

This time everything changed, the product was literally new, no use at all and I saved a lot of money.

I've been a long term Apple customer and will be forever."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I have had my iPad 2 since the first shipment dates.  I ordered it Apple direct and have been pleased with it every day.  I would order the largest size when I replace it as I have run out of space on my 32GB iPhone.  I prefer the krakken(available at amazon) case for this and it has kept it safe for years. I don't miss any of the features of the current full size iPad but do think its bigger than I would prefer.  When I upgrade it will likely be to a mini.  Happy shopping!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Apple iPad 2 MC979LL/A Tablet (16GB, Wifi, White) 2nd Generation...

B0013FRNKG	Terrific buy; I love this iPad! Nasty scratch on screen but I can live with it.....so happy to finally own an iPad...thank you.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I ordered this since I just wanted an IPAd 2 for fun, so why pay for a new one? The price was amazing but I got skeptical after reading some of the seller's reviews.  I wrote the seller myself and was reassured of the product.  It came in 2 days, was well wrapped, it was called Very Good condition- a few scratches on the back, but basically perfect.  It came with an older cover ($40.00 is what it said, but definatley not worth that today, but hey it's a cover), 2 charge cords, clean and working perfectly.  I just ran up to TJ Max to get a new cover- and it really looks like a brand new IPAd for about half the price!  I know I got a very good deal and was happy to have the seller write back immediately for all my concerns, making sure that I was pleased with the product. Don't know what happened to others, but I am very pleased with this product and the responses of the seller.  This was a great deal and I am enjoying every second of my ""new"" ipad for a great price.  Just get the seller's  email and ask questions if you have them- I feel they were very helpful  and concerned.  Even though this was cheap , it is still a major purchase for me and I feel that this purchase was made in confidence and carried through exceeding my expections.  Thanks IPAD MANIA!"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This exactly what I wanted and the price was great. There were no defects with it only thing was the USB part of the charger was not original so it charged slow but I got a real one and now it charges in a shorter time and the battery last a long time. This was a great buy.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Decided to update and give iPad 1 to hubby ...  I Like books so I wanted the biggest one.  I don't play games so I wasn't worried about the visual technology for the 3 or 4. When I started looking Apple didn't sell anything but the 16 GB ... When I looked on Amazon I found what I was looking for Amazon never let's me down. Brand new in original unopened packaging great deal!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"This has to be the best purchase I have made in years!
I love my Ipad! I didn't even know how to operate one when I got

B0013FRNKG	i am very happy with the Ipad 2 and with this seller.  I was hesitant to buy an Ipad online and from someone other than the Apple Store.  I was very relieved when i received this product undamaged and earlier than expected.  I would highly recommend buy from them again	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I bought the mini iPad and loved it so much I now have it up for sale. The reason being this technology is so good that the iPad 2 was for me. So I bought it and I couldn't be more happy with it. Thank you Apple	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	The I pad does everything that a new one would have. It came in great condition and I really am loving it so far!!!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Product arrived early. Works great. Few cosmetic scratches, but that was explained in description before I purchased it and the cover hides those scratches. The seller makes an effort to make sure the customer is happy with product.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Had to return the one I purchased since it was defective but purchased a brand new one elsewhere and it is a good product.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I love Apple. Hard to beat. I bought this one for my sister. Now she won't be borrowing mine. Worth the money!!!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Never thought I'd have a need for a tablet. Since I bought this, I haven't put it down. Love the Cloud network that syncs this with my iPad. That's a cool innovation.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Just as expected the only thing making it look used was the scratched off inscription, which is covered by the case. No problems and even received early.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I know the results will vary, but this was the absolute best purchase I've ever made!! The iPad was completely like new! Not a single scratch front or back! They shipped fast too. I was very please over all, and this was definely a good buy!!!	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	Great for Traveling or watching movies. It shipped and was delivered in sooner than expected! It did have a dent on the side which doesn't allow me to turn the volume up or down, contacted the company they offered to replace it, I decided to keep it anyway because I had already uploaded everything on it. I just adjust the volume in the media screen.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I love this iPad, it was easy to get it going, connected right away to wi-fi. The screen is big so my older eyes can see well, it's lighter then my freinds iPad 1, it synced up with iTunes well. Was nicer then described by seller and shipping was fast!	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	What's not to like about the iPad?  Worth the extra money to get this one with the camera on it.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Have been an Apple hater due to their prices for products made in China for minimal costs, but I like this item lots	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I had given my son and daughter-in-law and iPad for Christmas.  What none of us counted on was how much my 4 year old granddaughter loved spending time on it.  So, I decided to ""spoil"" her a little and bought this one for her.  She absolutely loves it, and since she is also home schooled, this is a tremendous asset.  The only drawback is that my son and daughter in law have to limit the amount of time she spends on it...she is like a sponge when it comes to learning!  I just wish these were around when I was her age!"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I mainly use it to process credit cards for my business, skyping with family and friends, and learning games for the kids. I have downloaded a ton of games and it still has a lot of space left, and having the camera is great!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I really really like my Ipad.  It is so light and easy to take on trips.  And my grandkids are also hooked on it!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The iPad lets me be mobile using it as my computer anywhere at home or when I travel, surfing the internet, taking photos with it, keeping up with email, skyping - anything I could do on my desktop computer I can do on my iPad. I can hook it to the tv to watch  movies, if I want. It is super light weight and easy to  carry around.	5	electronics

AMAZING AND WONDERFUL....	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	This was a Mother's Day gift for my wife.  I ordered it on Friday and it came on Saturday, just in time for Mother's Day.  Very pleased with the purchase.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	it came as expected brand new and was really nice. I still enjoy it and never got tired of using it.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I just recently purchased this used from Amazon and it is more than worth it. If you don't need the new version, go with this. I mostly read and watch movies and TV shows on this, and I couldn't ask for more. No way I'm a paying top dollar for the latest version when this suits me just find. I did a good amount of research on all the top sites and couldn't find a compelling reason to shoot for a higher version. Take my advice...stay a version or two behind the latest and save a ton!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I find it easy to use and especially like emailing with it. I use it every day and love how organized it keeps me.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Purchased this iPad 2 for the family so wanted to pay a discounted price compared to retail.  Could not be more pleased with purchasing our refurbished iPad 2 from RockerJakes.com.  We chose RockerJakes because of the detailed description of the unit and prompt reply when we inquired directly to the company before making the purchase.  The unit was described as having 3 scratches which upon arrival were very minimal and acceptable - especially after putting it in a case.  Seems brand new actually!  The unit came with a protective screen so we put that on right away before the children used the device.  Within minutes we were up and running the iPad 2 full force testing it out.  It works great and seems just as great as the iPads we have purchased brand new.

We did have some hiccups with shipping.  Didn't realize a signature was required to receive the package.  After wrestling with Amazon and UPS, we worked something out and Amazon was very customer focused and willing to help make things right.  Thank you!!"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I also would like to consider a mini ipad.
This product is great. Thinking also to get one as a gift but looking for another price value."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I bought this refurbished iPad 2 (32 GB, Wifi+AT&T 3G for my husband's birthday because he won't leave mine alone. Mine is also a refurb but I I bought it at Apple online and spent about $700.00 for it compared to Rocket Jakes price of $399. A Genius at Apple told me he prefers refurbished products as any FACTORY quirks that existed are straightened out. The iPad was simple to set up. It was in original Apple packaging and works perfectly. The AT&T Wi-fi was also easy to set up. AT&T has lower data charges for iPads than Verizon but Verizon has a larger coverage area. Alas! Money is tight. I also got a Smart Magnetic Cover for Apple Ipad 2 cover at Amazon from CyprusTech for $7.74 compared to the $39 I spent for mine at Apple and it looks and acts exactly the same. I'm thrilled with this product so far but I set it up with my Apple ID and now I'm going to have to jump through some hoops to figure out how to get my husband his own Apple ID because iTunes is all set up on one computer with MY Apple ID ....h-h-m-m-m! Another tech challenge.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"(Caveat: I'm not a techie dude (though I do enjoy some techno music... go figure, right?) so proceed cautiously with my review...)

I've been brought to the iPad dragging my heels, kicking and screaming, like a bratty toddler told to eat his peas (I hate peas).

My history: I've not been a fan of the proprietary and I love music.  Some years ago, before my kids bought an iPod... I owned a Creative Zen Vision M MP3 player... 60 gigs that thing carried... and I could download whatever I wanted into it... no proprietary poo and nobody needed to know my financial information or address, and I loved that lil device for that freedom.  Creative created a great product, and in fact they own a couple of patents that enable certain Apple products to work, but like Beta recording tape... a technology that was superior to VHS, yet it was popularity of the lessor product that eventually killed the chances of the better device ever really taking hold.  Similarly, from a freedom point of view.. seems like much of the MP3 market has gone the way of the dinosaur, losing out to the proprietary Apple name.  And so begins my review.

To recap: I hate proprietary.  And Apple IS that: proprietary.  Having said this, and yielding to my better senses, I have made allowance to bend towards the Apple by initially purchasing my iPhone.  I still hate the proprietary... love the device; Apple, begrudgingly liked by me for the things they build, made such a great device in the iPhone that I decided to take the leap by swallowing the whole schtick and bought this iPad.

This second generation, 16 gig, iPad purchase was a big one for our family... actually, for my wife (as a birthday present to her), and she's been tethered to it for two days... loves it.

It's a nice sized tablet... much easier to surf the internet with a larger screen than that of an iPhone, so that's a nice plus.  As for their proprietary... if you move to Apple with the purchase of your own iPad, you'll have to give them information... personal information, to include credit card, and normally that's enough to stop me in my tracks, so if you're like me and don't easily want to part with giving this info out... this isn't the tablet for you.  But before you consider not buying this tablet for that reason, remember that once you do give in, you're introduced to a world of great products and support.

As far as functionability... this iPad is basically a picture/video taking wi-fi accessing internet surfing tool (nice run-on).  Conceptually, the tablet is intuitive in it's function... if you already own an iPod/iPhone/iPad.... yet if you don't, navigation/use of this tablet is pretty easy to learn... easier still if you have someone that owns one helping you for the first 2 mins.

What makes this device interesting is the ability to add applications (apps) that enable you to do a millions things with this device.  Some apps are free while some cost money... and they're found once you hit the ""App Store"" icon on your device.

My iPad was purchased with the wi-fi connectibility option only; I wasn't interested in purchasing (another...) 3g AT&T smart device usage fee, though it's an option (another model...).  As for internet connectibility, I just have to find a wi-fi site and wahla... connection, at no extra cost to me.  Sure, this doesn't make the tablet very usable while in motion, but that's not a big deal for my usage intent... so this really doesn't effect me as it would someone who's occupation relies on such mobility usage (did that make sense?  Hope so...).

This tablet comes with 16 gigs of memory (same as my phone...); I have hundreds of photos and some video on my phone, but no music.  If you have an ample music collection you would like to carry/keep on this iPad, I might suggest you purchase one with a higher storage capability.  This iPad will be used by my wife and she's going to stick pictures on it, perhaps SOME music, but not much between the two; for her, 16 gigs is just right.

As for other functions: it's got a camera (don't ask me for specs... look them up.  New generation iPads have newer iris'/greater photo capabilities), that can also take video.  I can do a video type conferencing with another Apple device (another iPhone/iPad, for example)... it's called ""facetime""... that's a neat feature that my 4 year old loves when I'm at work for two days or more at a time.  Battery life seems good... charging is a snap; USB or wall... you can do both with hardware supplied.

Importantly, and to their credit... Apple does a great job supporting their products (my experience with a problematic iPhone, handled by Apple Care... was top-notch).  They take care of warrantied items very well.  An additional note: Apple stores, if you 've got one close-by... are a great resource for handling warranty/problematic software issues... so the support for the product, in-store or not, is there.

As for iPads or tablets in general... there are others, but even this second generation iPad makes internet connection, and use, a breeze.  After owning now... two devices, I'm a believer in the products that Apple (thus far...) have made... and though I STILL don't dig the proprietary thing, it's a reasonable trade-off for being able to use a pretty great device.

I hope this review assists you in making your choice, whichever that choice may be.  Thanks for listening."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	this was my first iPad and my friends had all said I would love it.  I wasn't so sure, but I trusted their opinions and got one.  I do love it and wish I knew all the things it can do.  I need to find an Apple store near me to go with my thousands of questions.  I did a live chat once about it, and they were wonderful in helping me understand what to do out of the box.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Only the one product you'll ever find. Cost cheaper than the latest one, iPad 3rd generation, plus you can take it any where on the go! There is nothing else to say but it's a great product! One of a kind!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I love my ipad 2.  I have a small jewelry business and now able to accept debit and credit cards using my ipad 2, as a result of this my sales have doubled!

B0013FRNKG	The iPad 2 is a good tool for those that don't have an iPad 3. I got it for my girlfriend and she has no complaints except for the middle button giving her issues. It only happened twice, but it stopped after a while. I recommend it for all.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This is a good product ..couldn't afford to get the latest version , but this works just fine for now .	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I brought this one to replace the one I let my grandma borrow that she won't give back.  It is the perfect tablet for the whole family. My 5 year old God-daughter can use it with ease, as well as my 69 year old grandmother. I love that Apple has restrictions under the settings that I can turn off everything, so my God-daughter won't purchase everything by simply clicking a button. I hardly use my laptop at all because this does everything my laptop can do.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I love my Ipad, but I was confused about how to use it. Luckily I took Ipad video lessons and now I am an expert. You can become an expert too: [...]	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I love this thing...use it constantly.  Wi-Fi works really well.  It keeps me from running into the next room to check for emails all the time.  It's small.  it's convenient and well worth the price.  I have not had any problems with my ipad..	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	I am enjoying the iPad. I especially wanted it to create documents, transfer documents from my laptop, and to do my sermons and presentations on. It really has been great! My only criticism is that Apple doesn't have a warranty on it.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	What can I say. I enjoy my iPad so much that I ended up buying two more of them  it would be to your advantage to buy one with more memory if you are a photo enthusiast like myself .	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I am enjoying my new iPad 2.  It'll take a while to explore all of the possibilities.  But it is already a useful thing to have.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	Since I already had the original iPad, I was very reluctant to buy a newer model.  Each time Apple came out with a new one, I read all the reviews and debated each time about upgrading.  I spoke to people who bought them and finally got a consensus that the iPad 2 was the best, all things considered for my needs and wants.  It's lighter weight and camera features were what sold me, and I am so happy I took the step.  I take it everywhere I go!	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	I'm writing to express how satified I am with my iPad.  I think it was one of the best investments I have ever made, I pratically use it for everything writing papers  for college, music, photos, videos, surfing the wed, games and email. My iPad has practically replaced my two laptops.  I'm not recommending to get rid of your laptop and get an iPad because there are certain things I can not  do on my iPad that only my laptop can do the job, but you should definately get one for its portability, accessibility and great battery life.  I was so impressed with my Ipad I went out and purchased an ipad mini this was in a 3 month period. Also plan to upgrade my regular ipad for the new edision with 120gs and my laptop with an Mac Air. I really like Apple products and wish I would have taken advantage of their products sooner.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	It was a good find, reasonable price and excellent condition. It has been very usefull and filled all my expectations. Only problem is, that there are so many features which you don't use so often and then you forgot how to use them. That's ofcourse more like a personal problem..	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"The price was right, the iPad perfect.  A ""complaint""?  Yes.  I don't apprecitate the little ad's that show up!  And why no user's guide?  If it weren't for some friends with an iPad2 for help, I don't know what I would be doing right now."	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	I was a bit skepitical on buying a refurbished ipad, but I am glad I did!  It is just like new and was as if I was purchasing it brand new!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	In November, I purchased the iPad Mini, which, was my first iPad.  I was thrilled to death to have it, and after a few months, I knew that I wanted a larger screen and more GB, so, I spent time trying to find out whether or not I wanted to spend for the iPad 4.  After some thought, I decided to get an iPad 2, since the mini and this one were built the same.  I am not disappointed.  As soon as I added the upgrade, I was able to use Siri, even on the iPad 2.  I personally can't tell the difference between Retina display or not, so, I am pleased with this purchase.  You can't go wrong.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	When I bought my iPad, it was a complete splurge. I was at the apple store to fix a operator-error with my iphone and asked about the iPad. I originally thought that it was just an overgrown iPod touch, but the more I learned about it, the more I realized that it seemed to be a small computer. The iPad has Bluetooth capabilities and I bought a Bluetooth keyboard to go with the iPad. I am still wrapping my head around the iPad and all its features. I really enjoy the iCloud, allowing me to sync up my iPhone and iPad. One of the first apps I downloaded was Pages and it has been fantastic. One of my biggest concerns regarding the iPad is the accessibility to remove documents, pictures,etc off of the iPad. There is no USB port, so I cannot hook up a zip-drive and due to the age of my Mac, I cannot download the iCloud app. So my only options are to email it to myself or go on my computer, go to the iCloud website, sign-on and get the document that way. When I brought this up to the Apple worker, he stated that the iPad is capable of printing directly from the iPad as an option as well. So that minimized my concerns. Over all, I am very happy with the decision I made, all my questions regarding the iPad have been able to be answered with a simple google-search. One of the best spur-of-the-moment purchases I have ever made.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Works great and saved a few bucks.  I really am glad I got my IPad. It does so much more than what I had imagined.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	I would recommend this product not only does it work as advertised, the price was great. The 32 gb is great	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I can't find anything wrong with Ipad2.  I don't even know why anyone would want Ipad 3 or 4.  If your eyes aren't what they once were then don't make the mistake of getting a smaller tablet.  This one is perfect.  Not heavy.  Not thick. Best Apps you can find.  I hardly ever use a computer anymore.  Now idiots writing virus programs for Windows operating systems doesn't matter.  My Kindle Fire books load into this via a terrific App and I can read them with comfort.  I can watch movies on it although I rarely do since TV technology lets me do that on a 55 inch screen.  But you ""can"" send video from the Ipad via an ""air video"" capability and view it on the big TV.  World Camera Apps let you see the world live on mounted video cameras.  Watch it snow up north while basking in 70 degree warmth in the south.  Cool.  Push a button and see the total of all your investments and bank accounts.  any time.  That's the MINT App.  Just save up and get the thing.  Great technology.  Gotta love it.  I use it every day."	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	I was given an older version IPAD from my brother last year and really liked it but it only worked on Wi-Fi. I don't live in an area where Wi-Fi is always available so I was limited to using it at home. so a few months later when my 50th birthday was coming up, my husband asked what I would like. I told him the only thing I wanted was the IPad with wireless AND 3G. Of course he thought I was nuts since I had a perfectly good, working IPAd already. So naturally, I got my wish!  We ordered a refurbished one to save money. I have not been disappointed yet! I take it everywhere with me. I am impressed with the speed even when using 3G. I am able to use it at our cabin and streamed our High School basketball State Championship game with zero problems.  The only problem I have now is I own a 5 month old Laptop that I rarely use!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This item came in its original box and looked brand new.  Was very pleased with my purchase.  Recommend this Apple IPad.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"I love a product that is intuitive and just plain works.  This describes the iPad to a tee.  It is sleek, easy to use, has a super long battery life, and has made me more productive in countless ways.  I use it for

- video conferencing
- tracking my fitness goals
- email and web conferencing
- reading books (especially at the gym)
- staying on top of my calendar
- taking and sharing photos
- watching movies.

I use it much more than I used my Kindle Fire and it's much handier than my laptop.  Love!"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Great Ipad, I gave it to my wife as Christmas present and she loved it, What I loved was how much I got it for!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	End all be all Tablet! it may be more expensive than the inferior android and windows based tablets but its well worth it!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Worth every penny. Love to watch movies on it. Nothing beats an iPad, there's allot more apps then i thought for the iPad as well	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Chances are, you know what an iPad is and know the positives of it. It is very user friendly, it has tons of apps, and they are all ran through Apple so they work very well. There are occasional crashes with streaming app, but it only closes the app and you can reopen it. This is the iPad 2, so, if you are expecting Siri... you will be disappointed. Siri is nice, but it isn't needed to love this product. The maps is still awful, but you can get Google maps and that is much better. Realistically, this is wonderful for people who do a lot of internet based surfing and want a phone experience but bigger. It is also great for family that is horrible with tech. If you are wondering, ""Well, I'm a power user, is there anything for me?"" Firstly, you should know how to look that up yourself. Secondly, yes! You can VPN into a laptop or desktop with many apps available in the app store to Virtualize your desktop from any wifi access point. Great buy and if money is a problem, the iPad 2 is now cheap enough to not be a big purchase."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I've always been a bit eclectic in terms of the hardware and software of my various electronic devices. I have a laptop running Ubuntu, a 2008 iMac desktop (I got it as a birthday present mere weeks before the '09 model debuted), I've used many Android devices (two phones and a tablet), and the only e-book reader I've ever used is a Kindle.

That having been said, after using the iPad, I'm completely won over to Apple. The build quality is superior to other products, the interface is smooth and responsive, and the software library (as is well known at this point) is incomparably large."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	it's fun to have for play and I can for school use it for school, to save my homework on.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	I'm still learning how to use it, but I love my iPad.  So glad I got the 64GB with wifi.  I've been able to use it for all sorts of uses.

I'd order it again in a heartbeat.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"First of all I have to say that Apple knows how to make elegant, beautiful devices that are packed with power and features.

Secondly, I bought this for school, I'm in my third year at college. I have completed a Teaching Certificate, Liberal Arts Certificate, and about to complete my Liberal Arts Diploma by April 2013. My iPad has been with me since day one, I use it everyday for research, readings, logging on to my schools system, and also typing up documents on Pages, and creating presentations on Keynote. I usually charge once a night, and that one charge lasts for hours. Its such a great device, very useful and helps lessen the load I carry around. Without it I would be hauling around a binder full of paper. In fact, I'm writing this review on my iPad. I looked at this purchase as an investment, and so far its paid off.

Best purchase ever - helps me stay on top of my studies.

I should also mention that I purchased a bluetooth keyboard, that helps me type faster: Logitech Ultrathin Keyboard Cover for iPad"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I used to talk so much trash about the iPad 1 when it came out. Over sized iPhone, what's the point, I'll stick with my lap top blah blah bleh. Well, that is until I actually picked one up and used it. After spending a whole day driving and searching through three towns for an available unit at any store,my gf and I finally found one ( iPad 1). Long story short it ended up spending the first week with me ( I know I'm awful) as I enjoyed hbo streaming through the xfinity app. When the iPad 1 couldn't cut it anymore I turned to the iPad 2 and I am more then satisfied even after the new hi res iPad came out. I love my 2 and prefer to surf the web and watch movies on this thing over my laptop. Amazon you're the best!	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"I purchased an Ipad 2 because I wanted a way to get my textbooks for class and not have to carry them all around in a heavy backpack.  Imagine my surprise when I discovered, not only can I do this, but at half the cost!  No heavy backpack, and over the last to semesters my Ipad has payed for itself in what it has saved me in textbook costs.  But that isn't even all of it!  I created a Dropbox and now I can look at documents for class, or review notes I have created while I am waiting for class.  I have also downloaded study help apps and homework apps that keep me up to date on what assignments I have coming up.

I also love the plethora of games and other activities available for when I have downtime.  If is a lot of fun!

My other favorite thing about this ipad is that I can watch movies, tv shows and everything else under the sun.  It is crisp and clear and the big screen is wonderful!

B0013FRNKG	we recieved it ,it was  packaged  very well,  if  you haven t used one  yet,  it takes a little time to get used to it,  compared to a normal  labtop,  but we have,  and  love it,  if  your  just  looking for something to surf the webs,  and  pay the bills  ,  it s  great,  and the fact that  you can load apps  helps  you make  it more personal.  make  sure ,  you get a protective cover  for it,  so it doesnt  get scratched up	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This is one of those must have products, it definitely will grow on you. The longer you have it the more useful it will become. Not only can you use it as a camera, but it can become your mobile office and library. I have used many of its features such as getting cheap kindile books on it, magazines, notes, answered email, searched the web, used the calender, looked up the weather. In short I have become I ad addicted.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Great product. And amazing Christmas gift for my paramour. I really think this word requirement for a review is quite ridiculous, by the way!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	it got to my house earlier than espected which was wonderful because it was a Christmas present for my daughter.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I had been wanting an ipad for a while. Mostly for movies and browsing the internet or occasionally listening to music. It is very user friendly and it came a few days before I had expected which is always nice. I hardly need my computer anymore. I just use my Ipad instead.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Cant say enough about this tablet, easy to operate and get around on it, it completely suits my needs. in fact i ordered another	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	THE BUYER IS ON TIME AND THE PRODUCT IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY SAT LIKE BRAND NEW STILL NO PROBS AND MY 6YR OLD LOVES IT HAVNT PUT IT DOWN YET......	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	On time, perfect condition, and the product is great. Xmas gift for a family member. Everyone should get one. Apple has done well.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This ipad shipped in time for Christmas just as described. It looked great and worked great. I would definitely recommend this to anyone. I was very impressed with the sale as a whole.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I have had every android tablet on the market, from the acer aconia tab, to the samsung galazy tab, to the blackberry playbook, all the way to the amazon kindle, and now i have the ipad as well. The ipad is noce, the app store is nice, the screen is big, but i like it. I have it in an otterbox defender series case which makes the tablet seem heavy, but the protection is well worth it, and the case's weight I became accustomed to. This is a great product, woth a lot of features, and completely worth the money. But there may be a few cheaper sites to find it (cowboom) but that is only sometimes. I received mine from amazon and am completely happy and pleased. Awesome tablet.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	We love the compactness...reliability and the speed with which it runs. Great for travel, around the house or around town. Still need the laptop but the iPad is an awesome fillin.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"The iPad was just as described--""like new"". I couldn't tell that it had been previously used. I was very pleased with the tablet and the extras that came with it. I presented it as a Christmas present and needless to say, the recipient was very grateful and appreciative."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I marked I Love It because it is great for what I bought it.  I has a learning curve for the new user.  I bought it for traveling and it has been what I expected.  So much easier to handle than my Macbook Pro.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I am a yoga teacher. I use this to capture new student contact info, keep attendance records, refer to pose cheat sheet, and play music during meditation. I also read a lot on it. I love having an extensive library at my fingertips. An incredible number of classics are free on iBooks, Kindle and Gutenberg.org as are lesser known works by the authors of those classics. The camera is not so hot, but I have a good camera. This one will do in a pinch. The other capabilities more than make up for the camera's deficiencies. The Facebook app makes viewing all the photos that go by on Facebook a wonderful experience. National Geographic is gorgeous on this thing.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This is our first iPad. Been wanting one for years now. Everything is great about it except the picture quality. May be iI just haven't figured out how to perfect it yet.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Works very well including the camera which my earlier model I am using now lacks. Battery seems to last a bit longer too.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I just love my ipad.  I bought it because I didn't want to spend the additional hundreds for the newest generation.  It is so easy to use and I can't say enough good things.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I have a kindle and a lap top and a mac and an iPhone.  There really is no comparison between Kindle and iPad so I won't go there but I do think that this ipad could replace my PC.  It does everything that I use the PC for and it fires right up instead of having to plug in and boot up and sign in etc.  Yay	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Awesome as expected.  Only bummer is new software not including SIRI, so I am missing talk text feature.  Otherwise it is all good and great price too! Thanks	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The iPad 2 I brought is everything I hoped it would be and more. I am very happy with my purchase.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"The shipping was very fast, the product was brand new, box sealed and perfect conditions.
I got the iPad 2 instead of the New iPad because even in the store I had them both in my hands and I couldn't see any difference. Couldn't even understand why retina display is so great.
I love my iPad 2, saved some money and I don't regret it.
Amazing purchase."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I use it all the time.  It's great for checking e-mail & watching movies.  Playing games are a plus also.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"I love my iPad 2.  I carry it everywhere, and will never need a laptop again.  Awesome!
While I did get the 3G version, I've never bothered to get it set up on a wireless plan.  There are enough Wifi areas available that I can use it almost anywhere anyway."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This is the second iPad I have purchased from this seller and I am just as happy as the first one.  The package arrived timely and exactly as advertised.  Everything worked the first time it was turned on and so far there have been no problems.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"In the words of my boyfriend, ""that iPad was a great investment, you use it all the time!"" And I do use it all the time, it has made my workflow a lot more enjoyable and makes things easier to view, more enjoyable to process and ties in my interests with the apps and everything. The seller who I got this from gave me a great deal and he shipped it promptly and kept up with messages to give me info about it. It came brand new sealed in its box and I have been jubilant ever since I carried the box from the post office to my house. I take it with me everywhere and I use it for a lot of different things such as checking my email, pinterest, stumble upon, writing on blogsy and pages, as well as drawing and creating custom cards on procreate (a beautiful art app) and a bunch of other apps that work with me. I do my couponing on this iPad and I just absolutely love it. I have an android wifi only device and I wanted to work with the iOS system in order to see it for myself, and I love both, for my uses, each platform resonates perfectly for me for what I use it. I am also a budding app developer and I like working both platforms. (: I love my iPad 2!"	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"This overall is one of the best tablets on the market right now.
The features are great. however the glass screen will crack easily if dropped on a hard surface.
But it still deserves 5 stars!!! HIGHLY RECCOMEND!!!!!!!"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	After I got this for my 5 year old, I realized what the big fuss was for Ipad. Great quick processer.. very good resolution ..many great apps (lot of apps for children kindergarden apps etc download).  Reccomend it.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	My iPad is so fun! I'm still discovering all it can do. It doesn't have much memory but I'm ok with that.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	We've wanted one for a while... finally bit the bullet.  We bought the one without the phone in it to keep the cost down... but we haven't had any trouble finding plenty of wi-fi hotspots where we could use it.  We can skype or facetime with our family also... really liking it a lot.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I purchased one of these previously owned and it came in the like new quality as advertised. It was boxed in the original box and included everything that it came with. The screen had no scratches, blemishes and you honestly could not differentiate this from one right out of the store. Very happy with my purchase. This is the second iPad 2 that I have purchased used and it is honestly worth it to do so because the savings is phenomenal.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I bought this one for my wife for Christmas last year. She loves Apple like I do so I bought her one.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"I have stayed anti apple for all of these years! It took a day or two to adjust but this is just an item I needed and it works for me:)
I wanted white and the way it was listed, I didn't realize I could have gotten the white instead, (didn't have an color option bar, had to locate white one separately) but I'm over that... Just letting you know for future reference."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I purchased this item for 2011 christmas for my 75 year old mother who wanted to have access to Facebook to communicate to her children and other family who live all over the world.  One of my sisters who lives locally uses this all the time when she comes over and now she wants one for herself.  I have played with many of the other computer pads like the Samsung but I think the Apple Ipad beats them all hands down. If it was not so expensive I would have purchased at least two more, but the price keeps me from doing that.  I rate this device with an A+	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	My daughter loved it. She has played on it every day scense Christmas I have to make her put it down.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Great for work. Easy to take along, Holds charge very well. Good for both work and play. Games are easy to play.	5	electronics

i think silly to need so many words for a review):"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	We are very happy with our purchase. We had one very happy boy on Christmas!! We couldn't be happier! Thank you	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I would recommend this product for everyone. The controls are simple enough for even my parents to understand (lol, I love them, but they're a little slow on the technological uptake), but the functions it provides and the apps that can be added are able to provide complex operations tailored to suit any need.

The battery life is amazing. I can use it almost continuously for approximately twenty hours before I need to reuse it. Less if I'm using heavy graphics, etc. But even then it functions for around sixteen hours. It charges very quickly when turned off and plugged into the wall. The screen is very responsive, and the keyboard is not as difficult to use as I had feared (this is referring to the larger keyboard that appears when you turn the device side-ways. The smaller keyboard is more difficult, but not impossible). The only downside I see to the keyboard is that I can't select Spanish letters and accents. I hear that there may be a way to get them, but I haven't had success thus far.

All in all, a wonderful device. I love it, and would buy it again."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Love the product, this iPad was a gift and as I won't shop at Walmart this deal was comparable to what they offered.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	I sold my Windows tablet to get this one.  I did not want to invest in the latest one, so I got this iPad 2.  It is everything I expected.  Very happy with purchase.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Works perfectly no damages at all is like a mini laptop a lot of memory good enough to keep me busy	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	It is great except the blue tooth does not work with portable printers such as HP office jet 100 & or canon pixma I 100 therefore I may have wasted my money I needed to be able to print on the road .	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Great product as always. I recommend this product to anyone who wishes to carry something smaller than a laptop. The iPad has everything I can think of that a  laptop or computer has.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I had another pad that I paid about half the price of this pad. However it work about half the time. When it comes to tablets apple has all the others beat. I know they are pricey but well worth it. All I can say is love it.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I know the IPAD 2 is not the newest but this unit has always done what I need.  I needed more memory so I bought a second one and my last one is being used by someone else.  Great deal on IPAD 2 as well, now that the others are available.  I have never had a problem with the screen on the IPAD 2 so really don't see the need for the high res on the IPAD 3 especially when you give up the battery life in exchange.  I know people with the IPAD 3 that would go back to the IPAD 2 if they had it to do over again.  - My opinion	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	It's the Ipad 2 do i really need to say any more, This is a great product from the Apple company.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	It came quickly and love it!  Perfect size, so convenient and it takes great pictures. I never use my desktop computer.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This thing is amazing! It works great, connects fairly fast to wifi. I only wish it had some kind of removable memory storage or USB port.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	So far, this product works well.  It seems pretty solid, so I don't think anything will go wrong with it.  Beautiful screen, a couple scratches on corners and back but nothing major.  Fast delivery. :)	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	You pretty much know what you're getting here - a great product at a premium price. That said, every extra penny has been worth it.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The iPad 2 is the next best thing to having your laptop with you at all times.  I love it, and now that I actually own one, I don't know what took me so long in getting one.  I use it every single day.  Great product!!!!!!!!!  Can't live without it.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I am enjoying my I-Pad very much. It is user friendly since I am brand new to I-Pads. Great product.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	My IPAD 2 is great!  Goes everywhere with me, small, lightweight and fits right into a normal purse!  Has many, many capabilities which I still need to explore much more but I get use out of it every day!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I have to face it. I'm an ol' lady; and Apple has made this iPad 2 sooo user friendly it's addictive!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	very good not englhis only spanish .... ...... ...... ...... ...... ..... ....... ...... ..... ... ... ... .... ...	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Why spend all the money on the latest model when this one is so similar? We opted for a used iPad, with 64 gb of memory. So happy with it. Fit many movies on it for our kids as well as ALL of my hubby's music and videos. Hubby happy, kids happy and wife is happy. What more could you ask for?	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This is everything I expected and more. Very easy to use and understand. Fast and no problems. Nice clarity. Good sound. Apple makes the best. Would recommend it over any other tablet.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	i love my iPad its light weight and i enjoy reading my books and magazine on it you have to remember to achieve the books and magazine case they do take up value space	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	My first one got stolen, and if I had to say there's room for improvement, they could work on some security app that would taze the person holding the IPAD if it were stolen, something basic like that.  Otherwise, it's so easy to use and the ICloud thing saved me.  I had just been on a trip with my old IPAD and all my photos were on that one.  Luckily it had updated just before getting stolen, and all the pix were on my phone as well.  Very happy camper!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Purchased this as a replacement for my OG IPAD and couldn't be happier. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a great tablet.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	What a great tool for communications, education, fun & games, hobbies, photography, work, play, reading, news.......the apps are endless and the power of information is unending! Great tool, my favorite electronic device ever!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I didn't think I would use an ipad...well other than a big toy.  I use it all the time.  There are many more usable/productive apps, and as a teacher I use it every day.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	We purchased this table to host square up only, so it is more than we need.  Would purchas e again.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	It works great love it.  However going forward I would not by a cellular device I would save the money and purchase only a wifi device saving a lot of money.  Free wifi is everywhere.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I bought this iPad for my two sons who are 5 and 3 because I was sick of them changing the settings and doing weird stuff to my laptop even with windows live family safety installed. This was my best purchase of the decade. The parental controls are amazing. I have Safari, iTunes, App Store, etc. all disabled. They have about 13 movies, 64 apps (mostly educational apps for letter tracing, coloring, baby Spanish, and so on), 28 books, and even Netflix for the weekends. They learned how to use it VERY QUICKLY! Within a day of showing them how to do stuff no more than once, they've pretty much mastered it. I have an Otterbox Defender case on it because they do abuse it quite a bit. When watching Netflix I hook it up to the TV so they don't have to worry about holding it. When we do leave the house and are away from WIFI they have plenty of content to keep them happy, esp in the car on long trips.

I have an iPhone so I haven't use it for myself yet. If you have PC and are used to Windows 7 you will feel the iPad is extremely limited on what you can do. The onscreen keyboard is very awkward for my small hands when typing because the letters are so spaced out. My WPM drop dramatically on the iPad but pairing it with a Bluetooth keyboard I imagine will fix that problem, except that I've yet to see one that comes close to my Windows Keyboard. However, I just installed Windows 8 on my PC and I hate it so much I am considering selling it and purchasing an iPad for myself.

I'm also saving up to get one for my 67 year old daddy whom calls me weekly asking me how to get the sound and video back working on Skype and how to get back to his FB page on his laptop. Some people just don't need a lot of settings to control!"	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	I'm still learning how to use it from tutorials online, but it's a great product convenient to take along, whereever.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I have enjoyed my iPad since buying it a few months ago. I was nervous about buying it online without seeing it in person but it appears to be brand new and I have had no problems with it. Reccommend searching Amazon before buying in the store. I saved at least $100 compared to a friend that bought his in the store.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I received my I pad about 3 to 4 months ago. I did not get this item from amazon, I am in high school and my school issued out iPads to 11th and 12th graders. It's a wonderful device, nice browser and it has a very responsive touch screen, not one scratch is on the screen. It has almost a glass feel to the screen, very good quality. It's light, the speaker has good sound. I have heard people complain about the camera quality, honestly I love the camera and I think it's great. I know its not the best quality but I thinks it's fine.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Havent opened the product as I bought it for a gift, but the box is nicely sealed and is labeled Ipad 2 64gb with verizon as I ordered. Super fast shipping. Had the product within 4 days after ordering.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I bought this for my grandchildren when they visit and do they ever fight over who gets it first!!  The younger ones like the games, the middle one (11 yrs old) likes the program to talk to her friends, and the older one (16) uses it like a laptop, and I like the games it has!!  So, there is something for everyone on this.  And of course it was delivered on time (actually early!!) and in perfect shape. (as Amazon always does!!)  Great purchase!!	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	Very happy with this product.  It has a lot of memory for video's and television shows, as well as books.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This product works great and is so awesome! I think it can: surf the web great, email great, and Facebook great, plus it is great with almost anything! I recommend this, but if you want the 3rd generation don't buy this and save your money. If you don't want the 3rd generation, go ahead. It is not so great with: word,  sometimes takes awhile to load, sometimes you have to tap it a bunch to bring a page up, but I still love it ;) don't think I'll buy the 3rd generation, this one is good enough!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Very Excited about this Ipad2  I have tested it and have loaded all my games.  Works great!  Can't wait for my son to see it Christmas morning!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Great product. After doing the research and finding about the bugs the new Ipad 3 was dealing with, going with the I pad 2 was not a bad choice. Very happy with the price and the quality of the product. Also, went with the wifi only model because it has been proven on certain research that the usage of this device and other tablets is mostly around places that have wifi service.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	seems to work great,, will be perfect for my daughter to learn on I am excited for her to get it for xmas	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	We purchased the Ipad 2, 64GB for Christmas last year.  This has totally replaced our desktop and laptop computers.  With the many accessories that Apple offers, there's not much that this little tablet can't do.  I do strongly recommend buying a durable case for the ipad such as the otterbox because the glass with break easily if dropped.  We are currently having the screen replaced on ours because it got dropped and shattered.  I wish we had bought a more durable case for it but you live and learn.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This product arrived looking beven better than it was described. As if it had never been opened. Software was up to date and the battery fully charged. I would definitely buy from this vendor again.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	the ipad 2 didn't disappoint, the whole buying process went fine with the retailer (I wasn't at home so it remained at the post office)	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I always thought the iPad was kinda stupid. It seemed like an overgrown iPod touch and nothing more. My mind is now changed. I live in a very rural area and internet service is 80-90$ a month and extremely slow. So I had an idea ""hey, what if I use the 3G on an iPad as a supplement to wifi in my area. Turns out Verizon works great in my area and it is only 30$ a month with NO CONTRACT. I had no idea you could get 3G without a contract, for me that really sealed the deal. Now I am using Internet that is actually FASTER then wifi in my area!  Since in am savings 50-60$ a month, the savings will pay for the device in 10months and end up saving me hundreds upon hundreds of dollars. I love it!

The Internet is surprisingly easy to navigate and the touch keyboard is much easier to use then I thought it would be. If you are in an area where Internet is pricy and all you really do is surf the web, consider getting an iPad as an Internet device. I am pretty sure you can tether it to a laptop anyways and use Internet.

For me, the iPad is an important, practical and HUGE money saving device !!!"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I haven't given this yet  since this this is a Christmas gift and I am sure she will love it!	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	I probably spent a month trying to find the perfect tablet...doesn't exist. But the thing about apple is they are more conscientiousness of their Apps where as androids are not and android has some catching up to do as far as full screen apps so I figured I would spend the extra money and get a used ipad 2 ( did not want the three because they changed the flipping connector :/). Great product, good job Apple	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Apple knocked it out of the park with these tablets. I'm completely satisfied and happy that I purchased one.  The pictures are decent quality and the screen response time is dependable.  Great purchase!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I bought this iPad 2 right when the new ones came out because I thought this was the best price.  My excuse to buying such an expensive product was that I was studying for the CPA exam and thought the apps would be helpful.  For me this is the perfect amount of space (I haven't run out yet and I have tons of games and other social apps and email)  I use mostly for personal and it is my favorite toy in the world.  I would recommend going this route instead of investing in a brand new iPad or other tablet.  You won't find as good apps as you will with apple.  I live in SC and bought it from someone in GA used.  It was like brand new plus i got a free case and screen protector which I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND to anyone who purchases one of these.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	It is better than its description. I like it. And it also functions so good. This is my right choice	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Just receive my Apple ipad it is in prefect condition, i brought it for my wife for her birthday,she love it. I received it really fast.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"Appreciate if product
Need to buy one more if any promotion is on to it
Need to buy at more competitive price"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I got the ipad2 for Christmas, being I'm a big kid (50) I got to open it 2 weeks ago.  I have not needed to pick the laptop up once sense I had it.  I got the Acer500 for Christmas last year and although it was nice it was very slow ever sense I did the last up date on it.  The iPad 2 is so much faster and does not loose the browsers like the Acer did. The only one era back on the iPad is it seems to me that a lot of the apps that re suppose to be free are very limited and require you to purchase something to go further in the game or to play it more than twice a day. When I used the Acer they had lot more free apps than apple does and for the most part when they are free they are not limited. I gave the Acer to my son he has lot more games to play on it than I do. Over all I love the Ipad2 mostly for its speed.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	If I buy it new does it come new in the box sealed up and never used someone please answer	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Owning both the iPad 2 and iPad 3, there really isn't much of a difference unless you use 4G/LTE or want to play the very very select few games that run better on the iPad 3.  The iPad 2 doesn't heat up.  The iPad 3 does.  The iPad 2 is a bit thinner and lighter (not much but notable).  Contrary to what I'd expected, the 2540x1480 screen is almost useless.  You still browse the web at only 720x1280, and most other commonly-used tasks.  Only a handful of games are made for 2540 resolution; therefore, it's practically useless given the iPad 2 is nearly half the price of the 3rd and 4th generation (which are both too similar to distinguish). While the A4/A5/A6 processors differ, it doesn't translate into real life differences in overall performance for watching videos, mail, web browsing, etc.  IMO the iPad 2 is s till the best tablet to come out in the past 3 years given that it's about half the price as those of its successors.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Ok it took me a while to jump on the Apple bandwagon, but I finally did.  Although I purchased a used Ipad2 (didn't want to still pay 500.00) I have to say it is worth it.  I have 2 kids 8 and 4 and as I told my father, there is just something about a device that you hand to your 4 year old and he can figure out how to use it.  He definitely knows more than my husband.  I use it for games e-mail, news.  My kids do games, math, watch Disney shows and fight over it, so much so that I might have to get another one but I am still not willing to spend full price will probably still look for a used model, works great for us.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	We got this iPad because it can read my husbands text books out loud to him (which helps with the absorption of the massive amounts of material he has to read for grad school) but the rest of us have fallen in love with it too. I like it because its quick and easy to grab and read blogs or look up a recipe and its not nearly as hard to type on as I was afraid it might be. And it is my very best friend when it comes to road tripping with our 3 year old. Road trips went from being a terror to a very enjoyable experience with the iPad (We got an Otterbox Defender case to keep it safe when the kid has it).	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Why? Compare two things and you will know. Time and Living. If these two matter to you, then look at how convenient it is to use an Apple based appliance. Some say intuitive. I say easy. Basic. Bottom line - resourceful all the time. Time is what you save with Apple iPad 2, second generation. The core of Apple is it's safety, not programs that take up your memory and time, costly in cash and down town, called security programs. You know what I am talking about. Security for the designers and owners, but un-necessary with Apple.

Easy to take-along with its weight-less characteristic, yet durable on the road in performance. Best buy for the iPad buck so far.

B0013FRNKG	I purchased this used through amazon at significant savings. Everything works perfectly. Like the camera on the second generation iPad. Great for using the FaceTime feature. The kids like it for the photo booth option (like the old photo booth you use to see in the malls, etc). Besides the millions of apps and games available for all ages, this is great for your e-mail, web browsing, showing your photos, watching movies through amazon instant video, netflix, or iTunes. Tons of possibilities. In our family, everyone uses it, from age 5 to 83! Terrific product. Don't be afraid to check out the used ones. I have purchased several used devices, and have never had a problem.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"There are so many reviews of the ipad I decided to talk about some things I love about it that many don't already know.
All of these favorite things work on the iphone as well.
I love the iPad and one of my favorite things it can do is take a screen shot or photo of anything on your screen anytime you want just by pushing the home button and the power button at the top at the same time.  This means that when you get a map of where you are going later, you can take a screen shot that will go right to your photos (camera roll) and then you can go there and email or text it to anyone else so they have a map to meet you there! You can do this with anything on your screen!!!! What a fantastic tool!
Another thing I love that people don't often know about is in the settings, general, accessibility section there are two things you can just turn on and they will read you almost anything out loud on your iPad!  One of them was created for differently abled people and one is more basic.  Speak over and Auto Text are the ones to look for respectively if you'd like to try these! They do take some getting used to.
One other thing I learned late in my use of this is that when you are looking at emails, you do not have to open them before deleting them.  If you just swipe your finger across one you know is spam a delete button will come up and you can delete it without ever opening it.
I will add more fun tips as I learn them myself!"	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"There is no doubt that the iPad in its 3 versions and the new Mini are by far the best tablets in the market (WSJ analyst and NYT analist concurre). The premium that the Apple models carries is justified since you are getting quality, service, reliability and most of all usability.

As one analyst put it. the iPad is the Rolex or the Porsche of the tablets, all others are cheap copies with hype and are considered a Timex or a Kya (nothing wrong with Kya or Timex only not to be consfused in terms of its quality and performance).

I have being able to upgrade all my iPad, since the resale value of the older ones is high, therefore with minimum investment I can have the latest model, nothing wrong with previous. I highly recomend to pay extra for value. You pay what you get."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I purchased this item as a gift for my husband and he just loves it. My advice to anyone considering purchasing an iPad would be to review the data charges with their wireless provider before making a decision on which device to purchase since data plans can vary greatly.  Personally, I think the option of wireless/3G is a great choice.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Bought this for my father in law and it is exactly as the seller described. He loves it and bought the perfect case for it.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I just  love my ipad2 the only problems i found was it doesn't have an agreement with adobe flash so some videos would not play but I bought the iswifter browser in the app store for $5 and now i can view any video I want.  then to upload pics they have to either be taken with the ipad or use itunes so I bought a memory card adapter that fit on here for only $2.78 on ebay and now I can upload my pics no problem. also it was interactive with Twitter only and not Facebook bit with updating to the ios6 that corrected that. love the app store. my husband has a kindle fire so i can tell you this is much nicer than that and the app store is way better. i also bought the smart cover as it puts it to sleep while not using. the battery really does last 10 hours, it has never ran down on me and i use it every day	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	The iPad two is great! It has a great 9 inch screen which is easy to carry around but not too small so you can see things very easily on it.

B0013FRNKG	"When Apple and Steve jobs made the ipad 1 I felt like I did not need one since I thought it was just a big iPod touch. So I waited then all the reviews were saying its good, but it did not have a camera. The ipad 2 is the one to get. Its great to look at, its thin, light, big,comes with 2 cameras,the screen is very beautiful, the colors pop. The sound is loud. But what makes the iPad 2 great is the APPS. Any app from cooking to taking the placement test to college to great games like BAD piggies,BASTION,Sonic the hedgehog, etc the app store has it ALL. You can also put your iPhone apps on it and make them bigger to fit the screen, you lose some resolution but that's nothing.

Pros.
Great looking
Thin
Big beautiful screen
Software is great
APPS anything you came think of.
Movies
Music
Face time
10 hour Battery life with wifi on.

Cons
16gb is not enough, apps are using retina display making some apps and games 2gbs per one.
Sound grill is in the back you need to cup your hand on it to aim the sound at you.
Get credit card ready, you cant have fun on this thing without purchasing apps.

When you compare the ipad 2 with ipad 3 all you get is the higher screen resolution the processor is the same and it has a 1 gig of memory on it,just a bit stronger to handle the screen, other wise there are no differences. You can do ipad 2 vs ipad 3 on youtube and see your self. Ipad 3 also comes with a 5 mp camera but has no flash. The ipad 2 cam sucks but it can record really good vid.

At the end the ipad change my life and it will help and change yours.
Mark my words the ipad (tablets) in the future will replace laptops in like 5 to 10 years."	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"The Apple Ipad Truly Amazing

  Just about two months ago I earned my Apple Ipad 2. It took forever to save up 600$ but is was worth it! I am able to do so much on it I am able to read, play games, go on the internet etc.

One thing that i enjoy is the screen is very clear, I personally don't have any problems reading or seeing anything!

  One thing that I enjoy to do in my Ipad is read quotes and sayings. I love how fast i can save them. My computer takes forever to download things like that. All you have to do is push one button and you are done!

  One other thing that i love about the Apple Ipad 2 is that you can set up a lock so nobody can get into it (like my little brother). I am the only one that can get into it! I love it.

  I think the ipad 2 is truly amazing! You can do so much on it. You can do the same things that you can on a computer, maby more! there is really nothing I dislike about the Ipad 2. Also I don't have any problems doing, seeing, hearing anything!

I think the Apple Ipad 2 is amazing for anyone and everyone who loves reading, playing games, and going on the internet. Any age!"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"The Apple IPad Second Generation is awesome! When my dad got it, all he had to do to be able to use it was activate it on the computer. It has really cool features. It has a camera and it can play videos and movies. It can also play games, surf the web, and more! Sometimes my dad lets me use it. Most of the time, I enjoy using it. Also, it's pretty much a big IPod Touch. This product can be your all in one device!

  I really like Apple products, and this product is a pretty good Apple product. You probably would like it if you're one of those people who like Apple products. You might not like it if you like Samsung tablets better. I think the Apple IPad Second Generation is a great product!"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Love it will look forward to ordering more in the future ;)))!!!! It was in great condition received on time and I absolutely don't regret getting it at all thanks!!!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I have a desktop computer and I hardly use it now. I love my new IPad and it's wonderful to have when we're down in Florida.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Awesome! Light weight, so easy to use & responds to WiFi right away- anywhere. I didn't  get the version 3 because it's heavier & I only use the camera on my iPhone. I highly recommend this product. Can someone recommend a good, protective case?	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	What can you say that has not already been said.  In a word EXCELLENT!  The product does Apple proud and gives the consumer a near perfect product.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	everything was a described. came charged, works like a charm will be other electronics from this company when the need arises	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I got this product for my high school best friend. She liked it very much. It's beautiful and very convenient to use	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Every thing I have ever wanted. It's fast, light and very easy to use. To top it off, App store has thousand of apps so I can transform my Ipad in pratically anything I want.
My husband has an Ipad too, but ti's the first generation Ipad. And now, he wants to use mine all the time (of course, it's way faster than his)..."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Received promptly, works great. I have had for this for  over a month with no problems. I am very happy with this purchase.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	After talking with Apple I was able to get my IPad up and running.  It is a wonderful product, as described and arrived early!  Best price I found.  Thank you.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Electronics have become part of our everyday life. They help to define who we are by being a source of connection to the world. An iPad is what has been my connection and has transformed my life exceedingly. It also enhanced every aspect of my life in many unique ways. My iPad 2 is reliable, family/school friendly and has also served as a memory book for me.
Apple has been in existence for decades, since 1976, and has grown to become our apple and nutrition of the day providing us iPhones, Macs, iPods and iPads. Apple has become a very trustworthy brand. Before I purchased the iPad on Amazon I needed to confirm that it was going to be worth my time, effort and money. I was blown away by the results of the reviews it had obtained throughout the years. Most of the reviews had given it a five star rating. At that point I knew I needed to buy my iPad 2. I anticipated its arrival anxiously because of the great qualities the product had. In the end, it was everything I had imagined it to be.
My brothers fell in love with it as much as I did, or possibly even more. I started exploring my iPad, downloading games and taking pictures. I am amazed at how much one little device can calm and contain children. I have four hyper active brothers and sisters and my iPad has worked miracles on them. They all sit down and as one quietly plays on the iPad, the others patiently wait for their turn. Before my siblings would be jumping and running around everywhere, yelling and fighting about everything. After that point my mom always carried my iPad and she is now buying one for herself. My iPad has become very helpful when it comes to school. I can take notes on it. I complete my homework on it.as type up my essays; watch instructive videos, take educational pictures and much more.  It also converts to a television on weekends. The screen is big enough to watch movies on it, browse Netflix and watch almost anything else. I have grown an emotional connection with my iPad and if you have a family or go to school, I know it will be the perfect product for you as well because it has the capability of helping one though any struggle that may arise.
Not only is it an amazing device because of the things it can do but it is also easy to carry around. It is very portable and lightweight compared to carrying a laptop. A laptop does not have the same durability as an iPad. The iPad will hold many memories; it will be like a digital scrapbook that you can easily access and always retain. The iPad memory is what preserves those special moments with your pets, family and anything that is very dear to your heart. The iPad may be purchased with different types of memory according to what it will be used for. Also because it is so transportable it has a great battery capacity, making the life of the iPad longer. Lastly, the iPad's 2 cameras will capture many memorable and wonderful moments. The camera captures clear and vivid images that will last a lifetime.
My iPad has been a huge focus in my life. I believe it will be a long lasting item that I will not become bored of or toss in the corner like another abandoned electronic. I will always feel confident in recommending this item and what better place to purchase it than Amazon. Amazon has everything for a better, cheaper price; it is dependable and has the option for fast shipping if needed. My life truly has been blessed by this prodigious electronic. I agree with most people that this item deserves a five star rating. It has been two years since I have bought my iPad and I continue to be a very happy costumer, and will continue to be a consumer of apple products in the future."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Received in a timely manner, package contained everything as expected and it is a GREAT tablet!! My entire family uses it for games, finances, reading and educational tools. If you have the money, I would certainly suggest you purchase an IPAD	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	So first let me say I looked and drooled over the iPad 2 for what felt like forever!!! It came to a cross roads where my husband said if you can prove to me that you need it you can get it... Well need and want are two very different things but I justified the purchase by listing all the functions and daily life the iPad would help with. I got my way and when I got my iPad was thrilled with what I had expected to be a super functioning and helpful tool. I hadn't realized just how wonderful it would be. From movies, music, books, shows, orginization, games and productivity, the iPad has made waves throughout my house. My husband has since admitted the need for more than one iPad in a single household. He is on it almost as much as me! Our 4 year old has found it to be enthralling and has provided a great outlet for learning, and entertainment!  It is easy to use, even for the kiddos and has provided our family with a great helper on long trips. Some of the apps are expensive but that is okay when you are choosy with your needs. Most apps have a free version. I have gotten pretty fast on the keyboard. The iPad connects easily to available wifi and makes using the feature painless. I love my iPad! I reccomend a case immediately! With an investment such as this you can't be too careful. Usually you can find them online or in discount stores. Because the model is the same size as the previous iPad and will likely be the same as the iPad 3 screen protectors need not be outrageously priced. I have had issues finding all the books and magazines I thought there would be, however I expect in short order there will be releases. Apple is always coming out with new and innovative products, accessories and updates. Great purchase!!! I am very satisfied. I am a Android lover, and iPad almost has me convinced I need an iPhone on my next go-round!! We shall see! If you don't have an iPad, don't hesitate, get it, it is well worth the price.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I purchased the iPad 2 as a gift for my mother to use as an ebook.
She ended up surfing the web, using her email, and downloading and listening to music from it. Now I know its
not hard to do that, nor is the iPad magical, but it was nice to give my mother something that was
simplistic, minimalistic, and very user friendly!

It was also awesome that the Geniuses we willing to help her out with EVERYTHING!

IF not for how cool, and sleek it looks, or for how good the product is, the customer service makes any apply product amazing!"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Very pleased with the iPad 2.  It's been great to just pick up and check email without having to turn on the laptop and wait for it to boot.  Also great to pick it up and take a picture without having to get the camera out and load batteries, etc.  Love the apps too!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I've had my iPad, which I bought used, since the end of April 2012.  I bought it to read articles (both academic PDF's and online fare via Instapaper) and play silly games, and it has exceeded my expectations on both counts.  I had used both a 7"" and 10"" Android tablet (modded Nook Color and gTablet, respectively) and a 4th generation iPod Touch in the past for pretty much the same purposes as with the iPad, and found myself not turning them on and subsequently selling them, so I was skeptical of how useful I'd find the iPad vs. a laptop or desktop.

The advantage over the iPod Touch is just a matter of real estate.  The interfaces of the universal apps that I've used (ones that are available on both the iPod Touch and iPad) are much better on the iPad.  Not to knock Android, because I was admittedly using heavily modded versions of it and didn't have access to the entire Market (now Google Play, I guess), but there really are a ton of good apps available on the App Store.  There are good, efficient implementations of board games, silly puzzle games, a perfectly fine browser experience, good Dropbox, Instapaper, and Evernote apps; I could go on, but, really, there are just a ton of ways to use the iPad well.  I don't use it for much productivity (outside of Evernote and Dropbox), so I couldn't speak to that aspect.  But as a fun device that's useful to me, it's easy to recommend it to others.  If you want to spend the extra $100 for retina display, sure, go ahead and get the third generation one.  If you're struggling between the iPad 2 and other companies' tablets, though, I say go with the Apple."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I am enjoying the iPad. It was easy to set up and add apps. It is all I had hoped it would be.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I recently made the decision to purchase an iPad. While deciding which to buy, I concluded that newer models (generations) are being made all the time and it is too hard to keep up. I ultimately chose the iPad 2 based on price.

Pros:
I was very impressed with how quickly my item arrived. I ordered it on a Thursday and was told I could expect it the following Wednesday-Friday. I received it the next Monday (4 days after ordering, including the weekend). In fact, i received the ipad prior to receiving the case. The packaging was great and there weren't any tears or major dents to the original box. The iPad was secure and protected.

Cons: Some of the apps are not formatted for the larger screen of the iPad. For example, Instagram remains the size of a cell phone screen. There is an option to magnify the screen in the lower left hand corner, however the display becomes pixilated.

Overall: I'm familiar with Apple products and am pleased with the product. It is easy to navigate and use. I am very pleased with my purchase."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The shippment is quick. The ipad is cool. And I am hunting for some interesting app to install.  Wish there is more free app there.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Loved the used iPad I got as a gift for my husband ! Looked brand new works like brand new !!! Worth time and effort to find and research !	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	It works just great.  I use it all the time.  I  was asked to review the product.  It would have been hard to do with iPhone	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	At first, I thought the idea of having an iPad was silly, until my friend was telling me of the benefits of having one. I debated and after some time I got the iPad 2. Now I love it. I take it with me everywhere I go. To school, work, etc.. I use it to write, watch movies, check email, music, and the occasional games. The main thing I use it for is to read e-books. I like that I can have a Kindle app, a Kobo app, and a Nook app all in one place without having to have several different e-readers. I like to get certain books on certain apps, especially if the price for a book is more affordable than another. Having an iPad just makes things a little more convenient. I love it.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I have owned and loved my iPad 1 and waited for the iPad 3 to come out so I could afford to buy the 2. My grand kids and I are all delighted with the upgrade to the 2.
I watch movies using the HDML adaptor 2 or 3 times a week and am pleased with the quality and lack of stutters.
Both the 1 and the 2 have been used as my primary readers using the Kindle App. I usually read 2 to 4 books a week (I'm retired) and don't have a problem with screen glare. If I'm outside I find shade to read in.
It's hard to find anything to complain about but I do find it gets a bit heavy when reading in Bed.
A solid Five Star product purchased from AMAZON.COM."	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	Being new to the MAC world, learning the IPad operation has been a challenge but one worth undertaking. So far I am very impressed with this unit and still learning it's capabilities. I tried another tablet last year and the connection speeds and operation was so frustrating that I returned it immediately. The Ipad 2 is very efficient even though I have to go to several different places to learn it's operation i,e, Itunes then ICloud, next Ibooks and Safari and much more to come I am sure.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"This product is Amazing and I would recommend it to any level computer or tablet user. It runs fast and has basic functionality, and if you can't do what you want to do with it out of the box you can easily find software to add the feature.

Pros:
Camera on Both Sides
Simple and effective User Interface
Built in Speaker
Runs pretty fast
On Amazon you can find the 16,32, and 64 Gig editions of this second generation tablet

Cons:
The Pricing on Amazon is not the cheapest you can find for the 16 Gig edition. You can go to an Apple store (base price $399 for the 16 Gig ) and get it cheaper than through Amazon's including Tax."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Product arrived in perfect condition, looked brand new and working as brand new despite knowing it was a refurbished product. Easy to set up the data plan just need to have access to wireless connection or a computer with iTunes in order to set up the iPad initially.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Arrived on time, IPAD works great.  Should have bought it a year ago.  Love it. Did not need much time to get use to an Apple product.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The iPad 2 is portable and versatile with a great color display and is owner friendly when it comes to ease of use. I read, play games, watch movies, and surf the net with my iPad 2. It is so much lighter and easier to use than a traditional laptop. The Safari web browser is lightning fast and works great for all applications. A top of the line product!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The Apple iPad 2 was given to me as a birthday present and I have not been able to put it down.  All of my friends are sharing apps and from the games to news it is the greatest?  There is still so much to discover.  I love it and would recommend It to anyone.  You must be able to pick up WiFi.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I am soon happy with my wonderful new iPad! Love that it came with a screen protector because the same day I received it my daughter scratched up my screen and I peel the protector off to check and make sure it was good and thank god it was!! I give my product and shipping time  10 stars.lol	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The two iPads ordered arrived in perfect condition. The purchased items were clearly identified as AT&T during the order process, but I required the Verizon provider. Items were given an RMA and return label within 30 seconds of my call. This is the best customer service I've ever dealt with.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Although this was a rebuilt unit, it worked perfectly, showed no signs of wear and was easy to set-up.
The iPad has met my expectations in every way."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I had been bidding on this item via Ebay with no success, as people were paying more than $430 for a ""used"" iPad 2.  Knowing they were only $399 plus tax, I made the decision to purchase a new iPad2 from Amonzon.  The item shipped fast and has been all that I expected."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This is a very good item to have cause it can be used for work and play. I have played a TON of games on this but I have also done a lot of school and job related work on this device. For basic users this can completely replace a laptop altogether. There are so many apps there must be something that exist for your needs.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This was a gift for my son. It came faster than expected and was in great shape new in the box and was easy to use and lots of fun.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I have had an iPad 2 for a little over a year. It was a gift and I can't get enough. From what I heard this is just as good as the new iPad. O with this, it's amazing for work play, and sitting in a snuggle watching YouTube and playing solitaire.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The used iPad2 that I ordered arrived within the timeframe promised and is in like-new condition. It was in the original packaging with all attachments included. The outer packaging was torn, leaving some of the inner package exposed; however, the product was not damaged.  As for the iPad2, it is indistinguishable from my 3rd generation iPad, except that it is noticeably lighter in weight, and is thus easier to hold. Having used the 3rd generation iPad for several months, I see no reason to pay the extra $$$ for it over the iPad 2. Unless one has ultra-superior eyesight, the display on the 2 is just as good as the 3.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"If you want to make pictures you have to choose the iPad 3 with the better camera. Also if you want to use it with GPS Navigation, you need a iPad with 3G - this iPad is only WIFI - so it don't come with an GPS! But for using it for checking Mails, or for Facebook it's perfect. If I don't have Wifi where I am I switch on my Hotspot from my iPhone and I Internet where ever I want. For the way I use it, it's perfect!
And the shipping was really fast. The dealer was nice if I call him and ask, if he can sent it as soon as possible! He does it!!!!!"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	didnt get the ipad 3 because  it is heavier, and don't care if the battery its going to last 5 instead of 10 hours. Just wanted a light tablet!!.the main problem which is not a secret to anyone at this moment is that it is very restricted to the use of the famous(infamous) itunes.the only way  to copy my tons of bookmarks was on safari and with the help of an expert. the only movie format that reads is mp4,and nothing ,pictures,files,videos,nothing can be organized on the tablet itself. It has to be done in the computer,and then moved to the ipad. In my humble opinion apple has never been friendly,or easy to use,and its full of restrictions but WHO CARES,its an apple, its magnificent!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Lightweight, fits in my purse, can connect almost anywhere. We carried it everywhere on a recent trip to Greece with pre-loaded maps and metro and museum schedules etc. Took lots of good pictures too.  While on a long train ride the kids played games. Good for the whole family.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Really glad I got a used iPad2 for a cut rate instead of paying almost double for the brand new iPad3. Went to the local worst buy and checked out both of them side by side and not much difference. If needed super amazing retina graphics for some reason, I'd get the 3, but otherwise, why pay more? It works really fast, is SOO nice to have. It's like a digital magazine, email and web browser, and everything else into one. And super portable. So glad I finally got one, it's so nice to have.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	I received my iPad a couple days ago and absolutely love it! It actually came a week earlier than the estimated delivery date which I was surprised because I was not expecting it yet. I had been doing my research on the tablets and the iPad but finally ended up choosing the iPad and It was definitely the right choice ,and the battery life is a lot better than I thought a full charge can last me about 2-3 days upto 4 depending how much I use it.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"I bought this for my husband and he loves it! He searches the internet with it, reads, watches tutorials on his various tools when he is out in his shop. The size is perfect, he can read on it easier then on the Kindle Fire because the screen is larger. We both have one now and are very happy with our IPads, we are in our late 60""s and it was easy to learn how to use. When the grandkids are over they like to play games on them too, inexpensive entertainment. One more thing, we downloaded a GPS app which is very helpful when we travel, skype for the kids that are out of state, and Words With Friends, helps keep us sharp :)"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I love my iPad. It is so easy to use and so useful. I bought the one without the cellular data ability. I didn't want to have to pay for a data plan and saved money on the cost of the iPad. That was the right choice for me. I use it all over the place with free wi fi spots so widely available. There are so many apps available that you can customize it for your needs very easily. This almost replaces my laptop computer. I hardly ever turn on the laptop anymore. The iPad runs faster than my laptop on most things online. I bought my iPad after falling in love with the one that I was issued for use in my special education class. I have been totally amazed at the things that I have seen happening in my classroom with the iPad. Any teacher, homeschoolers, or parent should have at least one iPad strictly for the kids. They are great learning tools with so many educational apps available--most free or low cost. And if you have a special needs child or student, then you doubly need an iPad for their use. It is much easier to use than a conventional computer for special needs children. And if you have a child with any disability on the Autism spectrum than you absolutely, without a doubt MUST have an iPad for your child. There are hundreds of apps designed just for people with Autism. If for no other reason than to use as an augmented communication system device, you must get this for your child with Autism.

If I am asked to name one flaw with the iPad, it is that it cannot be cleaned. The screen gets lots of finger prints and gunk on it--especially with children using it. And it will get scratches on the screen, no matter how careful you are. If using it in a classroom with lots of children it can be a germ breeding ground since you cannot wipe it down with disinfectant. At school, we stick them inside gallon zip close storage bags as a good protective covering that can be thrown out and replaced cheaply. Screen protectors are a must have accessory."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I already had an ipad 2 and i knew my older brother wanted one, so i got him this one and he loved it. It's small and smooth, very well done.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"The power of a mobile device is directly tied to its apps - and Apple's iOS platform wins there.  There is an app for pretty much any task or interest.
The hardware on the iPad 2 is much improved over the original, and not far removed from the ""new iPad"" with the Retina display.  In particular, the addition of a dual-core CPU and camera son the iPad 2 are great, useful features."	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	We were very skeptical to purchase a refurbished Apple IPAD but when we received the IPAD you couldn't tell if it was new or slightly used.  We have had it about 2 months now and is working like a charm!  Great product and MUCH cheaper than a new one!!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Upon receiving the Ipad we had taken it out of the packaging and went to charge it.  It wouldn't charge so I had sent in a rating and note to this supplier to have them contact us or advice us of next action.  They immediately called and was completely helpful and understanding.  It turned out the ussue had nothing to do with the purchased item at all.  The ipad wouldn't charge because the outlet in the house was not working.  Thanks to this purchase....we were even able to find out that we needed to get that outlet repaired.
Thank you for your immediate attention and i do apologize for any inconvenience or possible reduction to your excellent service.
My intention was never meant to do that but only have you contact us to advise how we could fix this issue.
Many thanks,

B0013FRNKG	"We received the product within three days over the weekend.  It was still in the original box with the Apple warranty.  The ipad was in near perfect shape.
The ipad is very easy to use and navigate.  We downloaded a few apps, all our itunes songs, movies and books.  Very easy to read, quality sound and screen.  We just love it!
We are already thinking of purchasing another one for us adults because our teenagers hog it and we want to play!"	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	I am very pleased with my iPad, never knew I would use it so much.  At first  had second thoughts about buying a used one but so far I love it and was taking care of .  I have jet to get a bill for it and don't understand that, no one at Amonazon seems to br able to help me with that.  Thanks for a good product.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Most of the reviewers have given all the pros and cons, so I won't bore you with another list here. Like most people, I use the iPad 90% of the time on just a few Apps. For me, reading an ebook, checking stock quotes, and reading the news constitute most of what I do. It's good to have half a million Apps, but it's impossible to use that many, or even a fraction of that. I've compared the iPad to the Kindle for reading ebooks. For me, the iPad is the clear winner. In my opinion, the iPad is easier to read and is sharper, also the color is a plus. The Kindle is hard to read in low light. Maybe if you are outside, the Kindle would have the edge, but I never read outside, and I think most people don't (possibly some do at the beach). I have an iPad 1 with WiFi and 3G, and an iPad 2 with WiFi only. I think the WiFi is the way to go because of the cost savings. Sometimes the 3G is nice, but I don't use it that often. Bottom line, I can recommend either model. It's reliable, easy to use, and Apple has the updates to improve things or fix any bugs that crop up.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The Ipad2 is a very good product. I bought it when it came out from Apple. Mine was stolen a year later and I bought this one from Amazon. It is exactly as advertised and is working in perfect condition. I saved about $150. I would highly recommend this to anyone.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Was in the market for a tablet to be used during a planned international trip. I didn't want to lug mt 17"" laptop through airport security and on to my destination. After considering cheaper options, including Samsung Galaxy and small 10-12"" notebooks, I decided on the Apple. I've been using Apple IPOD's Classics for many years to store my ITUNES music library to play while at home, during trips and in my motor vehicles without any issues during the warranty periods and beyond. After speaking to both friends and family as well as reading reviews here on Amazon I decided to purchase the IPAD 2 16GB version. It's my first tablet & all I can say is it functions perfectly in my home using a refurbished Netgear 3500 wireless router for WIFI and a Bluetooth keyboard case from Trent also purchased here on Amazon. Screen resolution for the IPAD 2 is sharp & using the Safari browser for accessing my emails & internet browsing is easy to get acclimated to.  For those who wonder if they should purchase the Apple Care extended warranty I suggest no unless you are planning on dropping the IPAD on a hard surface!"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I needed a larger memory on my iPad 2. Since they are only available in 16GB from apple, I was having a hard time finding a new one with 64GB, even online. Amazon had a vendor who was able to sell me the higher memory iPad at a reasonable price, and it was shipped promptly. I am very satisfied with this purchase from all points of service.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	I received my iPad 2 in great new condition. It was delivered in prompt time. It works great!! I even purchased an outer box for it to completely protect my iPad.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Awesome, what can I way, item is awesome and was brand spanking new when I got it, I expected a returned item to have the initial item shrink on iPad to be missing, but it wasn't it was great, amazingly fast shipping, super seller!!!

B0013FRNKG	This Ipad was in much better condition than the product description. It said light scratches on the back well, there were very few and hardly noticeable.  Ipad was in great condition. Fast shipping. I would recommend this seller to my friends and I would def to business with the seller again. Thank You for the Ipad.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I have been waiting along time to get myself one of these.  I guess the waiting paid off because I finally got it. You can do some much with an Ipad, it's endless. It's amazing just like Amazon is.  I order from here alot, and I will continue to do so.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Great tablet plenty of gigabyte space.  Easily handable.  I would reccommend this product to everyone I knew because it is like a pc and does everything the same as a pc, but at a cheaper price...	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I first would like to apologize to Audio Video Communication Store the feedback I did yesterday was wrong and there was a misunderstanding because the Ipad was returned and did not understand very well and exactly what Audio Video Communication Store solution offered as an apparently I'm wrong, so I'm entering a new feedback but,anyway  I don't receive my Ipad ,but I was receive a solution that I apparently did not understand.
Again I Apologise!!

B0013FRNKG	"It's an iPad! The tablet that all other tablets are measured against.

Yes Apple has released the new iPad (or what the rest of us call the iPad 3). Apple Marketing, please think about your naming conventions in the future! But I still love my iPad 2!

I use my iPad 2 just about every day. I mainly use it for reading email when I don't feel like pulling out the Macbook Pro. I also use it as an eReader (Amazon, Nook, Safari Books online, MacTech magazine, iBooks, etc). No it's not the retina display. But if you can't afford the retina display this is the next best thing. I can read this one just fine, so no upgrading for me.

I didn't choose one with a data plan (would have been 3G when I bought this - last year), but I don't find that I need one. One hint on the data: If you can find a decent mifi data plan then you can just get the wifi version of the iPad and be done with it. Even so, I find wifi hotspots all over the place (including my house of course, which is where I use it a lot).

The camera is ok, but I use my iPhone for pics, so I really don't care. They could have substituted the camera for some other feature and I would have been just as happy.

It is an awesome game platform as it gives you more space to play with. It also works great with the Apple TV and streaming audio.

Yes, Android tablets are catching up, but they still aren't there yet. They don't have the price point of an iPad nor the consistency of the user experience.

The iPad is also a durable product: I have dropped mine, and only had small cracks appear on the bezel, with no affect on performance whatsoever. Still I recommend some kind of case. The smart cover is good, but doesn't protect the back. I'm still looking for my ultimate case.

I have made it through an entire plane ride (cross-country 6 hr trip) without running down the battery completely.

Looking for the best Tablet experience, don't want to have to figure out some convoluted interface? Buy the iPad."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I am truly enjoying my ipad2. After purchasing I had some concerns because it was an open box product. I had it checked out and it was a good deal for the price I paid.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This is my first experience with an iPad2 and I have to say I LOVE it! I tried to buy one from the Apple site but they no longer offer the 64 GB model. The seller shipped quickly and everything was as listed. There is so much to learn and so much one can do with this product. I am looking forward to using it!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I bought the Ipad as a graduation gift for my granddaughter. So far I am very pleased with it. It arrived on time and in great condition. It is being used more than I had imagined it would be! She has had absolutely no problems at all. She will be starting college and probably get great use out of it.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The iPad is great and functions perfectly. I opted to get the 2nd generation with 3G and 64 gb  unit and have I activated the 3G which works good. After a little confusion regarding the shipping timeline, the seller upgraded the services to meet the expectations at no additional cost. One thing to keep in mind though is that the delivery requires a signature at delivery so for a residential delivery may get delayed if no one is home.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I was a bit skeptical to order from a new merchant with no ratings but I'm very happy I did.  I got an iPad at a great price and thought it was to good to be true but it was true.  I expected it to arrive next week but I got in 4 days sooner and was pleasantly surprise and very happy.  I will definitely buy from her again confident I'll get the same super fast deliver and quick response.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I bought this for my 11 year old daughter.  She absolutely loves it, considering many of her friends own one as well.  I don't even have one myself...go figure.  She loves the apps and takes lots of pictures with it.  I will probably upgrade her to the newest version since it has better picture quality and keep this one for myself.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I love the iPad that I received from what I can tell there was nothing wrong with it and it was in good condition.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	I received it really fast! It was in perfect condition and factory sealed just as advertised.  I have an iPhone and this is basically a bigger version.  I love how compact it is but not as small as a Kindle Fire.  It was easy to sync the apps I already have on my iPhone to my iPad.  I would definitely purchase a product from this company again!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The APPLE IPAD 2 is a great device, I am very pleased with it, I wish I would have ordered a long time ago.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Pad received quickly and in like-new condition! Saved lots of $$ on a long-awaited Fathers Day gift! Thanks do much!  I'll shop again soon.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Im writing this review from my iPad. This is my third tablet ( others where Android), and this one is the best. Before I got this I was on my computer ALL day, now Im only on once or twice a day now. This does everything. It runs apps very smooth. So far I have not had a problem with this!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I was so horrified when I found that my new iPad would not charge. Angel Seller replied to my concerns and offered to replace the product asap. She also offered that I could take it to a local apple store for even quicker replacement. She stood ready to assist in any manner. Luckily the apple store agreed that it was defective and replaced it on the spot. Angel continued to follow up with me to ensure that I was satisfied. She is great to deal with. I'll be back for sure.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Product was even better than listed the ""scratches"" on the back are barley viable especially once you put a case on. My bf was really happy with his birthday present :) Fast shipping too!"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Love this gadget...I've learned how to play chess. It definitely gives me a way to escape and get news quickly.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Arrived immediately in perfect condition, exactly as described. Answered email Qs within 24 hrs. And came with 6 mos existing Apple warranty. Highly recommend.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I'll start by being brutally honest here and admit that initially I doubted Apple's Ipad when it was initially released in 2010. I didn't see much utility for it and frankly thought it was a bit silly and I wasn't all for it. I didn't see much use for it although I recognized it was a nifty, cool little device but thought it was a bit too much like an Ipod touch. Forward to 2012 I now am the owner of an Ipad 2 and loving it, I'm converted. It wasn't until I had the opportunity to spend time experimenting and playing with the tablet that I saw myself using it me and bringing it along with me, in short wanting one. I've owned an Ipad for a little over two weeks and with this time passed by I've had enough time to enjoy and experiment enough with this device that now seems to be the right time to review it. If you must know I went for the Ipad 2 simply because I liked how remarkably slim and light it was and although the Ipad 3 has the new retina display, to me it didn't significantly expand the second generation of Apple tablets for me to pay a hundred dollars more (money is important after all and is a deciding factor) to have the ""new"" product I decided. I read reviews and articles, comparisons between the second and third generations of Ipad and came to the conclusion that I'd be well off with 16 GB Ipad 2 and from then on would decide whether or not to upgrade to one of the future Ipads depending on my use and enjoyment of the tablet.

You can say all you want but no one presents and markets a product quite like Apple is capable of (and does). They're often criticized for how expensive their products are yet they are everywhere and well designed and thought and they're hard to ignore.  Apple had success with the Mac and Mac book and their different models, the Ipod, the Iphone (all with variations and updated models of the same product) and more recently with the Ipad. I'll be the first to admit Apple's gadgets and electronic devices can be expensive but I've also never had a problem with any apple product I've owned in the past.

The size is one of the best thing about the Ipad, it's neither too big nor too small and the screen is big, bright and clear and there's just so much you can do. The interface is excellent; it feels and works great, looks neat and simplistic and it's very easy to catch on. It just feels natural and anyone from a child to a grandparent can use it and understand the bare basics an enjoy it. The applications or ""apps"" as they are called are truly what MAKE the Ipad the innovative device that it is, otherwise it does a lot of what your Iphone/Ipod touch or Laptop/Desktop do which is still keep in mind, excellent. There are ton of apps for different needs be it for reading books and magazines, to taking notes, playing fun games and everything in between. There are ton of apps already on the market, some brilliant and very useful to some downright stupid and new ones are constantly being created. Many apps are free, not most but a good quantity are and the range from the 0.99-1.99-2.99-3.99... 9.99 etc.  There are apps that serve as business tools, diverse utilities, fun mindless games like the popular Angry Birds, there's Safari as the internet browser, you can set up you e-mail accounts, manage your bank account, make hotel reservations etc. The list goes on please believe! There's of course Itunes from which you can buy music, movies and more and have them uploaded instantly to your Ipad. You can also sync it to any existing Itunes account and select material to upload to the device. I also like that there is both an inward and outward camera like on the Iphone so you can take pictures of anything you see or yourself which is a very nice option I thought I'd mention.  Those programs and apps are all stored in your Ipad via the memory it contains whether it's 16, 32 or 64 GB and ultimately the amount of Gigabytes you have determines how much content can be stored on the Ipad. The battery life is roughly ten hours (of course depending on certain factors such the brightness, volume etc.) which is not bad at all and still better than my laptop.

These are just a few thoughts and suggestions if you're considering purchasing an Ipad.

-  For me just the Wi-Fi model was fine. However, if you're often on the go and have a need for internet that can't wait and need it ""right now"" all the time without close Wi-Fi access available at all times then maybe you should consider getting a 3G model for just a little more $ with a monthly or pre-paid plan.

-Another thing you might want to consider is the memory you're going to need. The 16G model has in reality 13.9 G (there is always a certain portion of available storage taken before even touch it) and I think for the average user this will be fine (besides you can always remove apps etc. and it does keep track of whatever you've downloaded in case you want it back). Most apps don't take up a whole lot of storage room although some are bigger than others. The same with music, it depends how much you plan to use the Ipad for music and this also applies to the books you buy and how many you plan to buy keep (although the books aren't as bad as the music and movies as far as I'm concerned, I wouldn't worry too much unless you're a hardcore reader who plans to store plenty of books).  If you're planning to upload a lot of movies or have/use a lot of data then perhaps a 32G or 64G model would be a better fit for you considering how movies can easily be over 1GB each. They're more expensive of course but may warrant the consideration if you'd rather have the larger number of Gigabytes but and not take the available space entirely than have one that's filled up soon after.

-If you're interested in owning the latest thing and see potential great things about the Ipad 3 like the retina display and the upgraded processor you may want to go ahead with the newer model. Otherwise the second generation Ipad makes a viable option if you want to save a bit of money, other than that the two devices are basically identical and at first look no one could notice a difference between the 2 and 3. If you're considering either I suggest you do some research as I did, especially if money is an important factor in your decision and then decide for yourself which one it is you want.

-Another somewhat big decision is the color choice, whether you want a black Ipad or a white one. Personally I went with the white one as I liked how it looked and it seems to me that most people I know own the black. The color is not all that important it's what it can do and the options it gives you although some will insist on owning either one color or the other.

-Last you may want to protect the Ipad with a protective screen just in case (it's always better to be prepared) to protect it. You may want to consider purchasing a nice case to store and carry it and maybe even a stylus pen if you think you might be into that type of thing.

In a world where tablets are rapidly and steadily selling Apple's Ipad has in reality very little competition partly due to clever marketing but mostly due to the great product they delivered.  Don't have a lot of negatives, if any, to say for the most part I am really liking it and find myself using it every single day and it nearly replaces my laptop. It does close to everything I want to do with my laptop usually, for me the Ipad is now one of those things tht I can't live without (not literally but still!).  I made the jump and find myself enjoying the Ipad and like it for its portability which makes it great for travelling and carrying wherever I go. It's entertaining, useful and smooth.  I like that I can have so much in one convenient sized device that doesn't take up a whole lot of space, can access wi-fi, check my e-mails, play games and more. It's not as big or heavy as a laptop, does not overheat even when running for several hours and opens MUCH faster yet it's not so small that it's inconvenient to type or a little hard to read (or touch in the case of my cellular phone) and do tasks with a cell phone, it's a perfect balance if you will. I really don't have anything negative to say about my Ipad, it would be nice in the future to have place for a USB/SD slot and I believe that may be coming eventually.  Obviously I've been praising the Ipad a lot  and I don't regret my purchase, full marks *****."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Love it....recommend for needing space to load movies for special needs child so got 64 gb.  She was already proficient at using iPad for apps and music and videos.  I had ordered white but sent black...I kept it since needed it for graduation gift.  Great product!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Love the IPAD, arrived on time and in great shape. I am still learning more and more about the IPAD and all ther apps etc. Am so looking forward to using it in my coaching.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This is a great item. My husband uses it all day every day. Could not have bought it anywhere else for the price.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	We recently ordered the iPad 2 from Amazon for our Daughter-in-Law's graduation from San Diego State University's graduate program in Nursing. We were very happy with the ordering and delivery experience. The iPad 2 is a viable alternative to the iPad 3 if pricing is an issue. The only sacrifices are in not having the Retina display and a lesser megapixel camera - the iOS software and apps are all the same. iPad 2 dimensions are the same as iPad 3 so all iPad accessories are transferable. We opted for the Verizon 3G version even though our daughter uses AT&T cell phone service. You can do this because iPad 3G service can be activated without a long term contract and in general Verizon's data coverage is better than AT&T in our daughter's service area.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	It was well done and I am enjoying the I pad very much. Came shipped in good manner and on time.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I must admit that I was a little scared to buy my iPad from any other seller than directly from Apple. Received my Ipad way sooner than I expected which was great! It arrived in its original Apple packaging and I was also able to get working without any issues whatsoever! It's a bigger version of my iPhone and is really convenient when I travel. I don't need to worry about the ""extra weight"" from hauling around a big ol' laptop. Love it! Love it! Love it!"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I am very happy with this purchase!! Not only did it arrive quickly, but it was in very good condition as promised. I could not be happier. If i am in need of anything like this again I will definitely buy from this seller. 5 stars well deserved. I am enjoying this ipad....purchase was well worth the money!! Thanks	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Having purchased two new I-Pads from Apple, I later purchased a ""refurbished"" I-Pad-2 for a friend. It was delivered on the date it was promised and, for the past month, it has worked the way it supposed to work. He's extremely happy, and, of course, so am I. There are two purchase points I have steadily had positive results: Amazon.com and Apple. They do exactly as they promise and their stuff works the way advertised!"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	this product is basically a benig phone that you can't call on.  I love it a lot!  Its light and thin so easy to carry and there are so many apps to enjoy.  It is very easy to get internet from it then from my laptop and I think its the technology of the year!  You've got to get this.  If you don't, you don't know what your missing!!!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	My mom recently bought this ipad and loves it. It is well worth the price and is alot of fun playing. There are soo many things you can do such as watching movies, playing apps, searching the internet, listening to songs, overall its just a wonderful item to have. The screen and color is beautiful, and movies come out wonderful on the screen.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Well lets see, the graphics are amazing, the memory is ample, the music playing is wonderful whats not to love. The only thing i'd say is that it feels a little over priced (like all apple products). I recommend you buy this and get the two year insurance plan from Geek Squad and a case for the back and a cover.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I love my iPad and find myself using it everyday.  I wish I would have realized that it didn't have the 3G before I purchased it.  I would recommend making sure it has 3G just so you can have the option.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I originally bought a first-gen iPad 3G, and was--eventually--very happy with it. I was a little disappointed with it at first, since it wasn't ""magic"" and didn't really live up to the hype. But I used it for reading books and watching movies, and slowly found myself using it for more and more things, until eventually it replaced my laptop (which, with my netbook, now sits collecting dust most of the time). Between my iPad and my desktop computer, they cover just about everything I need or want a computer for. As a result, I can't see myself buying another laptop, ever. (Or perhaps I will buy one some day as a more mobile replacement for my desktop.)

When Apple brought out the ""retina"" iPad, they also dropped the price on the iPad 2, and I bought an Apple-refurbished iPad 2 as an upgrade for my first-gen iPad. But this time, I stuck with wifi-only, since the AT&T 3G was (and is) marginal in my neighborhood, and went with the bottom-end 16GB version because I had never used more than 12 GB of storage on the original iPad.

For three-fifty plus tax and free shipping, the refurb iPad 2 is a ridiculously good deal. Apple replaces the battery and metal shell--the parts most likely to be damaged or worn out--when they refurbish iPads.  I honestly can't tell that mine is a refurb. It looks and acts like it is brand new.

The iPad 2 is significantly faster than the original, which I notice mostly while browsing the web, but also with some games. It's lighter, and the battery lasts almost as long. Apple keeps adding features to iOS, so the iPad continues to become more useful. (Thank you, Google, for keeping Apple on their toes.)

I look forward to upgrading to a refurbished  ""retina"" iPad when Apple brings out the next generation. But for now, the iPad 2 is terrific."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Happy with the Apple iPad. Plenty of storage for my Wife's needs and having the Verizon data plan should give very good coverage.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Apple's reputation for quality is unsurpassed in thier tablet.  Very intuitive and easy to use.  I was able to touch type on the screen without putting on my reading glasses ..... a real plus for anyone who did not grow up in the texting age and like most of us over 50 need reading glasses.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	It was an used item but looked just like new, was delibered in time, and is working perfectly fine for me.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Cant go wrong with an Apple IPad.  What else can be said about this product that has not already been stated?  For Less than $399 it was a steal!  One definite is that this ipad2 is much more than what the average user will ever need!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Not a scratch on it. It works perfect. The box also looked new, and everything was in the box instruction and all literature that comes with a new I-Pad. What a great vendor. Thanks for the great deal ! I will buy from this vendor again.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	We chose to buy the IPad because at the time I thought it was important to get my son familiar with technology and I knew that there were a lot of educational apps that we could download for the iPad. So far our whole family absolutely loves using the iPad. We are always looking for a new application to download. This is a great piece of technology because the whole family can use it. My daughter who is 2.5 and my son who is 4 have absolutely no problem using it. My husband and I also use it for many different things. The best thing is that we can take it in the car and the kids can watch videos off of Netflix. We have a screen protector and a case on our iPad and it has been very durable. The kids have dropped it, stepped on it and carry it around with them and it doesn't have one scratch on it.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The iPad runs great! I had been wanting one for a while and it was great to find one at such a good price that runs like it is brand new. I am actually writing this very review on it now. It works marvelously and am glad that I made the purchase.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	I never  realized what I was missing by using a pc instead of a Mac product all these years. This thing is amazing! It is so easy to understand and use I can't believe it.

B0013FRNKG	I'm enjoying my IPad ! Excellent price and excellent quality! I had it know for about a month. If you are looking for one this is the place to get it from.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Love the product. got it before the estimated arrival date which is next. Shipped on the same day i ordered it. Ipad was new and had original packaging. Everything on it functions and im loving it. Deff a good buy. Good product. Got this ipad 3 stylus and a leather case for 590 something. totally worth it.

This really comes in handy if your a college student like myself.
the screen is big the keyboard is big
apps are lovely
battery life is pretty good (last long)
i got this instead of the new ipad because its
cheaper than that ipad and still a good product.
Books look awesome on here.

Con: Apple doesnt have microsoft office (they do have apps like keynote,etc which are somewhat like word,etc.) but i suggest everyone buy quickoffice pro hd. its price (20 dollars in the app store) may bug people but its cheaper than microsoft office
You can use excel,powerpoint,word,etc. i use it for homework.

B0013FRNKG	"The iPad 2 is exactly what I needed.  I chose this version over the ""new"" iPad due to concerns about heat generated and battery life.

 It is great for everyone that loves to travel.

Excellent costumer service.

I will recommend it."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"The good: Apple's iPad 2 is dramatically thinner and boasts front and rear cameras, FaceTime video chat, a faster processor, and 3G options for both AT&T and Verizon.

The bad: The iPad's screen resolution hasn't budged, photo quality is mediocre, there's still no Adobe Flash support, and ports for HDMI, USB, and SD all require adapters.

The bottom line: The iPad 2 refines an already excellent product. Its easy-to-use interface, vast app catalog, and marathon battery life bolster Apple's claim to being the king of tablets.

Overall, I would recommend you buy this."	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	Without a doubt, my iPad is by far the most useful and FUN electronic purchase I have ever made.  I wish I had purchased it before spending money on other products, which are nice, but not as wonderful as my Apple iPad.  This statement is coming from a 71-year old who has had NO problems with it.  One more important thing........AMAZON is a great company to work with.  You can even speak to a human if need be.  I am sending this via iPad since my 2- year old computer is being repaired!!!!	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"I bought an Android-run tablet (not from Amazon) a few weeks ago and tried my best to see its good points. I really liked its construction and novel appeal (had ICS) at first and continued to find reasons to improve it thru updates, useful apps, utilities, etc. All throughout I realized that I spent more time researching online for ways to improve  my Android tablet, than the time I was actually enjoying it. There always were issues that had to be remedied and problems that I had to seek  fixes for, the most significant of which was poor battery life and frequent crashes.  I finally got tired of ""babying"" my Android tablet and returned it promptly in new condition. That same day I bought an Apple Ipad 2 from a bricks-and-mortar store. Then I realized someting funny: that this was the third time I returned an Android device in exchange for an Apple.  First, when I returned an Android smartphone for an Iphone two years back. Second, when I returned an Android multimedia device for an Ipod Touch last Christmas. And now, my new Ipad 2 which replaced the Android. I am enjoying both stability and excellent battery life in my Ipad 2 -- and no more researching for fixes and no more ""babying""!  Was buying the Ipad 2 more expensive? In terms of more cash out the pocket, yes; but in the long-run, I know that my Ipad will pay for itself. Now, I am not the brand conscious type and would readily buy a Coby or Emerson if it works better than a Sony or Samsung. Though I run the risk of sounding like a commercial, in this case of getting a tablet, the Ipad 2 won me over the Android simply because .........it's TRIED and TESTED and it's THAT GOOD."	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"- Durability: 10/5
When I say 10/5 I mean it. 3 days after X-mas, I dropped my brand new iPod 4G on a stone-tile floor (about 3-4 feet up) and it shattered (Apple replaced it free of charge :D), yet I'd still give the iPod 4G a 4.5/5 in durability. I've dropped my iPad 2 on the same floor maybe 2x. It got a tiny dent in the aluminum frame. I have dropped this iPad on wood floors, ceramic tile, stone tile, concrete, asphalt, you name it (yes, grass, too). I do not, nor have I ever, had a case on it. Sure, the edges of the case are dented beyond repair, but the screen and (surprisingly) the back of the frame are scuff-free.
BUT!!! However you drop it, DO NOT drop anything on it! My TV remote slipped from my hand less than 1 foot above my screen, and it obliterated the home button, which I now keep in my pocket. I found it extremely ironic :)
The screen is impossible to scratch, however. Not gouge, but scratch. Since it's broken, I ordered a new screen. I decided to see how tough the screens are by scratching one with a nail (as in hammer and nail, not finger nail). It could not scratch it. Since I don't remember much of the Mohs Hardness scale, and I lack a diamond, it's somewhere between a 3 and 10 hardness.

- Personalization .1/5
Apple has too much restricted customer customization of this product. As soon as you get this product, JAILBREAK IT! Jailbreaks are not illegal unless you install illegal sources. If you don't like any aspect of Apple's software designs, from there being a six-icon limit on the dock, to being able to run all your applications in windows or have Siri on the iPad, Jailbreak it. 99.9382% of the time you'll find the tweak you're looking for.

- Size 2.3/5
Frankly, 2 years ago when I was 13 I was flipping out to get such a big electronic toy. Now I think it's too freaking big. If you want a size that is good for presentations, yet still retaining good mobility, go with an iPad. If you want something you can stick in you're jacket pocket yet still be able to read, get something nearby the size of a Kindle Fire, even though I personally think iPad is 700x better.

- Battery Life 5/5
...
I sometimes sit there and watch the battery drain, because I'm afraid if I open an app it will die (obviously this is at maybe 5-30% battery life). Yet sometimes I've found I can play for 4-5 hours, on a 3D game, no less, from 100% to dead.

- Display ...
The part we've all been waiting for...
Honestly, I'd have to say... 4.6/5
I thought the display was absolutely stunning. That is, until I saw the iPad 3. I started seeing minor (MINOR!!!!!!) flaws on edges. This was mostly in a few particular apps designed for both iPhone and iPad, most of the other apps were just fine.
If you don't mind not having 3,100,000 pixels, take 786,432 pixels instead. You won't notice a difference, so long as you avoid iPad 3's.

- Versatility 5/5
I use this for school, homework, games, browsing the web to buy a new screen, FaceTiming with friends, staying up-to-date with friends, you name it. It even makes a good paperweight :)

- Overall 4.85/5
Very satisfied."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"My old laptop died after I just bought a new car.  I had no way in paying for a new laptop.  Since I am no longer a full time student anymore, there wasn't much of a point other than just entertainment purposes.  All I really like to do is check my email, watch youtube videos, listen to music, and listen to church sermons and play chess.  I wouldn't want to spend a ton of money on something just for those purposes. A cheaper laptop I could have got but they honestly wouldn't last long.  So the Apple Ipad was a perfect idea and it works well for the unimportant stuff I like to do off the internet.  Well worth the price indeed!!!

By the way, I am not trying to be sarcastic.  The Ipad is a big help for me.  As I have went through periods of depression, I don't know where I would be if it wasn't for being able to listen to the sermons off the internet, nor communicating with my friends through email, and even getting my mind off of things through playing chess and listening to music.  I thank all of you at Apple for letting me experience these things at an affordable price."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I bought this ipad 2 from Amazon because it was cheapier than buying it  from apple. I believe this is the best tablet out. the only thing to beat it is the ipad 3. there are so many features it will take a life time to figure out all the neat capabilities. I can also watch any video format on it with the Goodplayer app from the app store i can also play flash media on it with the photon app from the app store as well. the capabilities of this is endless.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I bought this for my husband, as a wedding gift from me to him actually, he loved it and we have not stopped using it since it came into our lives. The reason I went to online purchase is because at the time it was really difficult to get your hands on one of these bad boys in stores. I would have had to camp out and hope that there were enough to go around. I couldn't do that at the time (planning a wedding) so I decided to purchase it online. The ipad is awesome. Fast, the battery lasts forever, and it picks up wifi quickly and efficiantly. We love it and use it all the time.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"Two years ago, my laptop became infected even though I had a current and up to date Kaspersky license.  I still remember the error message: ""Viruses are coming.  We will disconnect you from the Internet.  Good Luck.  Good Bye.""

Over time, the viruses left but I kept searching for a permanent way to separate from Windows and for me the iPad2 is it.  Gets me on the Internet, and coupled with a Bluetooth enabled keyboard, lets me type out this review and upload it to Amazon.  Every day I try to learn a new feature.  Once in a while, I make the trek to an Apple store, break out my iPad2, and yammer with their geeks about whatever it is I don't understand.  Today, we covered the file synching. Across the aisle, a 5 year old reached up, hit the keyboard on one of the counters, and set off the security alarm.  Next week I'll start taking pictures with the camera.  Baby steps.  I'll get there."	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"I love the iPad, i own a laptop and i absolutely prefer my iPad. Why? Just the fact that when i want to check something out on the internet i just press a button and voil! All set. The size is perfect for me because I carry my iPad with me wherever I go. It's very easy to use since you have all your apps right there, not like other tablets that are NOT organized at all. I'm a fashion design student and my iPad has turned essential for me. Whenever i see something i like I save it and I look at it when I need inspiration. It became my notebook, there are pretty amazing apps like InClass and Noteability that let you make notes take pictures, video record, and even make voicenotes so it's very complete to me cause i get to have Everything really organized in my classes. The iPad speed is amazing. The keyboard is very easy to use and responsive! If you're a physical keyboard lover I recommend you the ClamCase. It's set up via bluetooth, and it gives you something the other cases don't; you can put your iPad in ALL angles you want since it's 360 degree!
One of the things that concern people is the printing... Just save the dang document e-mail it to yourself and print it whenever you want! So.. Is the iPad useful? It REALLY is!"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"After being tempted to buy a tablet for many months, when Apple introduced its new generation iPad and, at the same time, dropped the price of the earlier version, the iPad2 by $100 across-the-board, I jettisoned the thoughts about buying a relatively inexpensive Android device with a 7-8"" screen and bought the basic iPad2 with the minimal 16GB and WiFi only. Initially thinking that I was buying a new toy, a `novelty', I soon discovered that the iPad2 is much more than that. I use it for dozens of things I never imagined using one for and have become quite attached to it, especially when travelling or just sitting in my favorite easy chair at home.

A great deal has been written about the technology and capacities of the iPads, so I will not waste your time reiterating them here. Suffice it to say that this one is the most basic model available. It requires a WiFi connection to operate and its total storage capacity is what seems like a `mere' 16GBs. My focus here is more on my personal experience with my first tablet. I am glad that I waited for the iPad.

Being a 65 year old man, my are no longer nimble enough to manage the tiny keys on a Smart Phone nor is my vision acute enough to read things easily on a 3"" screen.  On the iPad, however, with its 9.7"" screen and keypad that is entirely adequate, I have become quickly facile.

The limited memory is entirely adequate as I do not download and keep movies and am not an accumulator of music. The memory is needed to manage the necessary receiving elements of the various applications (Apps) that I choose to install the capacities for. Many are free, a lot of them cost between 99 cents and $3.99 and some cost more. The most expensive one I have is called ""Pages"" and is a comprehensive word processing and office management suite. Compared to the prices of `installable' programs, this is remarkable cheap. Some of my favorite apps are free, like voice recording capacities and ""GoSkyWatch"", an App that looks at the night sky through the out-facing camera and shows what constellations are there. It is like having my own telescope.

The 20-30 Apps I currently have installed have used about 2GBs of the total available hard drive. I don't expect to run out. The exclusive use of WiFi vs. 3G has a pro and con to it. In the Pro column, WiFi is pretty universally available in most places and it requires no paid data plan to access the internet and use all of the iPad's features. On the Con side of the ledger, the device is usable ONLY where there is a WiFi connection available. With 3G and a data-plan, the iPad can connect from anywhere you can access a signal for your cell phone.

At this time, for my own purposes, this basic iPad2 has been a rather surprising delight. I understand that the camera resolution on the third generation iPad is far superior, but what I see on this iPad2 is perfectly adequate for me - and, I expect, for most other people as well.

The price is right and the product is truly outstanding."	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	I purchased the IPad2 after reading several reviews about the new Ipad's internet connection issue. IPad2's setup was very easy. I already have an ITunes account so it took minutes to get started. It took less then 5 minutes to get my secured internet connection working. I was disappointed that I can not play any games through my steam account. The application only lets me chat with other users so hopefully steam will provide an application that allows you to play your purchased games using IPad. I really like being able to use Kindle's and Overdrive's readers in order to read ebooks. I plan to install VMWare on the machine so I can use it to work with .net applications.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I bought the iPad 2 after I had accidentally sat on my Kindle on an airplane and needed to make a decision - do I replace the Kindle or go with the iPad.  I had always told my wife that her iPad was little more than a toy, but once I got mine, my world began to change.  Sure, I have 40+ games downloaded, so I definitely enjoy the ""toy"" factor, but I also use it to take notes at meetings, keep up to date on emails and have even used ""docs to go"" for verbal presentations.  It has become an awesome tool in my life."	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	Other than not having the Retina display and all those tiny features that come with it, this is the Ipad 2. Its thinner than the Ipad 1 and runs a bit sleeker. It's actually easier to hold than the Ipad 1 which got heavy at times when I was laying down and watching a movie or show on it before bed. It's nice to carry around for college classes then carrying around a laptop, which can get heavy. Great to take notes with, type papers up, edit photos, surf the web, read, watch tv/movies/netflix, pandora, and play games! This doesn't have the retina display but I don't really need that insane graphics. If you want something that is now cheaper than the Ipad retina get this as an alternative. It's a great Tablet and still sets the bar high! 5/5	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"After owning a Kindle 3 for a year, then a Kindle Fire for 6 months, I am now the proud owner of an iPad 2. I am also in a position to compare the two tablets without any bias at all.

First, why the switch? The Kindle Fire is a great tablet, much better than the Kindle 3 in my opinion because of the apps, the small size, the backlit screen, and the Silk browser. And for many months now I have compared the iPad at a distance to the Kindle Fire, and I kept coming back with ""why would I want to spend $500 on an iPad when I can get a Fire for $200? I already own a laptop. Why would I need so much functionality in an eBook reader?  The iPad solves a problem that I do not have.""

But the advantages of the iPad only become apparent once you own one. That's when the large screen makes you realize how much you squinted at the Fire's smaller screen. How much smoother the Safari browser works than the Silk browser. And how much better the selection of apps are on the iPad.
So, once the new iPad came out and the iPad 2 price dropped by $100, I found myself thinking seriously about it. And before I knew it, I had one. And I like it. I like it a lot.

Now, I am still a huge Amazon fan and have no intention of leaving Amazon, so the thought of reading books and watching Amazon Prime videos on a non-Kindle device filled me with a bit of trepidation. Can it all work as nicely on the iPad as it does on the Kindle Fire? The answer is ""Yes"", with one rather large exception: video. Unfortunately videos (TV shows & movie's) downloaded from Amazon require Adobe Flash which Apple does not support on its mobile devices, so that was my first disappointment. But that's been my only disappointment so far and it turns out that it's not a huge problem at all. All of the other pluses of the iPad make up for that. There is plenty of video for the iPad: it's all on iTunes, and a lot of it is free. The Kindle reader works just fine on the iPad 2, in fact its nicer with the large screen.  Book prices on Amazon and Apple appear to be identical. Although the iPad 2 is larger and heavier than the Fire, it's not that much heavier to be a hindrance and I don't see it being any more difficult to slip into my travel bag. Battery life is about the same. But for sure the apps available on the iPad are a welcome sight compared to the Kindle, in both the quantity and quality. This is really where the scale tips heavily in Apple's favor. Sure, Android has thousands of apps available, but Amazon does not let you have them on the Kindle. You are restricted to only downloading the apps that Amazon has approved for the Kindle Fire, and that turns out to be a disappointingly small number of apps, many of which are of mediocre quality.  I would find myself eagerly searching the Kindle app store for the same apps that I enjoy on the iPhone, only to find that they are simply not available for the Kindle Fire. Apps like Skype, Evernote, TED, PBS,  Dropbox, Voxer, SayHi, WeightWatchers mobile, and plenty more. Another experience that is much better on the iPad is watching the news and documentaries while I walk on my treadmill. The bigger screen is a huge improvement and with all the great apps for news and shows, there truly is no end to what you can watch. Add to all of this the microphone, front & back cameras (I got the Wi-Fi only model), accelerometer, GPS and compass and you now have a much more exciting tablet experience. I also found the Silk browser to be clunky and unresponsive at times on the Fire with tabs & buttons that are small and difficult to press , while iPad's Safari is easier to use and has not even hiccupped. Could it be my wireless router? The distance to the router has not changed, just the tablet, so I call that a Silk issue.

So what really changed between the Kindle Fire and the iPad? Me. I thought all I wanted was a good eBook reader and for the last couple of years, the Kindle more than sufficed. But I found out that my needs and expectations have changed and I what I really want now is great tablet. And that's the iPad, hands down.

Correction: The wi-fi only model does not have a GPS module, but the location services and digital compass can still show your location for apps that need it. Interestingly, turn-by-turn directions in Mapquest work fine, as long as you have a wifi signal, but unless you have a good wifi signal in your car, GPS is pretty useless."	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"When I read it was going to be a used iPad 2, I was expecting it to be in some decent condition.

When it arrived in pretty secure package I was glad. The screen had no smudge on it (as if they took the time to really polish it up).

Software was out of date, but that was easily resolved by hooking it up with iTunes. Gave the iPad as a gift to my mom and she loves it.

B0013FRNKG	"First, let me tell you about what you can do on a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kindle-Fire/dp/B0051VVOB2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kindle Fire</a>
...
I just told you what you can do on a Kindle Fire. The only advantage the Kindle Fire has over the iPad is the Directory (built-in) and the Android side-loading. The apps are not well built, and after a while, the UI (or user interface) gets old!
-
Now, let me tell you what you can do on a iPad that is BETTER than the Kindle Fire:
Video, Camera, Skype, Kindle APP, (which I find WAY better than that of the Kindle its self), Agmented realiy apps (Such as Flow, junaio, Microsoft Photosynh), apps that require audio input and iPhone apps.
-
There are MORE things you can do, too though I just named a couple. If, in the case that there are no apps that suit your needs on the iPad, it works with iPhone apps VERY well, too.
-
75% of my LIFE is on this thing (iPad), and on my old Kindle, less than 5%. Saddly, the iPad killer just got killed by the iPad."	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"Despite the newer iPad being released only a short time ago the older second generation model remains on top in my opinion. If you are considering a tablet this is definitely the model for you. Apple has put a lot of work into making iOS as easy and accessible to the masses as they can, and that makes for a very pleasant experience. The iPad is great for watching videos, listening to music and reading books. I use my iPad more than I use my computer! There are so literally millions of apps to try. So you might be wondering why I still think this second generation model is King over the newer model? Well the reason is simply the price. The current gen iPad has always been a bit pricey but since the latest one came out this ""outdated"" model has dropped significantly making this the time to get an iPad 2."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Nice for price.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I was extremely satisfied when I received my ipad. It was exactly what the description had described. Brand new and at a great price. THanks	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Apple continues to turn out excellent products and more importantly, their service is unmatched.  The stores are excellent for help even if the product is not purchased there.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The Apple iPad 2 has been everything I expected in this Tablet.  I have found that the 16GB is giving me all the power I need over the 32GB as I don't download movies and music.  The picture quality is outstanding and easy to use.  2nd Generation IPad is highly recommended.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Awesome?..I love it.  Of course now I paid too much for it.  Great dealer got here fast!  I don't like doing reviews.  But I love this iPad	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	hands down this iPad smokes the competition - I am no Mac drone but this beats the H--L out of Android based tablets no question - I have a Lenovo K1 which just can't keep up with this iPad - maybe Apple shouldn't be a $600 stock but they sure make some real awesome technology	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Can't say to much about the Ipad. It's made by Apple,it works as well as any other Apple product. The charger gets hot just as the Mac Book so we'll have to wait and see how long it lasts. As for the Ipad, SLICK toy!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I am not sure how I ever lived without an iPad.  I use my iPad 2 all day everyday.  In fact I am reviewing my iPad on my iPad. I can't complain about anything about it.  I would recommend getting at least the 32 gb if you plan on keeping movies on it at all.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	There is nothing like an iPad. My wife has a Fire after seeing how much nicer my iPad is, she wanted one. I got her the iPad for her birthday and she loves it.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I have multiple apple items. And this is defiantly one if my favs! It's light weight. Convent and helpful. I don't regret my purchase not one bit!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This is an absolutely indispensable device to own in the professional world.  As an officer in the Army, you can't believe how incredibly useful it is to have the ability to access any one of about thirty manuals that I may need to facilitate mission complete without having to tow around the weight (each manual tends to weigh around 2-3 pounds.)  I get very excited when I think about all the ways that I will be able to put this tool to good use while on deployment.  It just makes life easier, period.  Buy it.  That is all.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	It help ipad stand steadily. Before this, I usually got sore with my neck. Keyboard is very useful while write a letter or a document.	5	electronics

My kids love playing with it and it is portable more so than a laptop we set up hotspot with iphone and instant internet."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	surprisingly lite, expremely fast and tons of fun. i caught myself playing a lego game which was meant for my kiddos. my kids weren't right for netflix, and enjoyed the portability of the ipad from play area to play area.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I got this for my wife, but have not been able to pass it on.  Of course, I needed to ""check it out"" and now I will have to buy one for her.  Love it"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This is a great prodcut. I synched it with my work email and calendar to keep me up to date when I am traveling or at home. I wasn't sure I wanted to spend that much money, but it is well worth it, with all the extra apps and games you have access to. Love it.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I have a quick question, why are all the Ipads still so expensive while you can buy them new from the apple store for only $400? here they cost like $450 new. and used like $400, for the Ipad2 at least	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"As someone who loves gadgets and still rebels against getting the latest thing, the iPad 2 at a reduced $399 was the route I took when the new iPad came out last week. After converting to an iPhone and iMac last year, it seemed the logical next step.

The true selling point is its portability. In bed, on the couch in front of the TV, and definitely for traveling-- this is a great accessory for checking email, Facebook, and browsing the web. The interface is simple and the display is great.

The cons are minimal. As an e-reader, the backlit display is hard on the eyes, so I find myself going back to my Kindle with its e-ink screen. And I find myself reminded that the iPad is probably closer to an iPhone than a computer because it limits some of the videos you may want to see since there is no way to get the Flash Player plug-in, which so many sites require. YouTube and Netflix, however, work just fine.  Although it was a bit frustrating when I paid for in flight wifi on a plane yesterday and still could not properly load a Netflix video.

Overall, though, the iPad does exactly what it says it will do, which is giving the user a computer experience more personal and portable than a laptop. I have photos on it to share with others, church materials, kids books and games, magazines like People and Reader's Digest, and the all important Facebook app.

It is more of a toy than a necessity, but what a fun toy it is!"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"This product came in excellent condition, it is really like new, with original package and every single original wrap.

Highly recommended.

Thanks."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I can't say enough about this product.
Its fast, intuitive and fun.
Accessibility is built right into the product right out of the box for various types of disabilities.

I am blind and use voice over.
Its clean and intuitive and highly functional.

The apps are great and I love sinking with ICloud and having my schedule, photos, contacts and data pushed to other devices.

The screen reader has multiple voices and they are clear and understandable.

Email, internet, calendar, clock, notifications, and much much more are highly accessible for the blind.

There are many other apps that can be added to use for work or fun.

Looktell Money reader identifies dollar bills, gps apps help with navigation and travel, IBooks is accessible and reads with the voice over voice.

I bought a roocase in hot pink to protect my investment and absolutely love my IPad2.
I highly recommend it.

It can be paired with an apple or other bluetooth keyboard if desired or use the touch typing or other mode of typing to enter data.

This is an excellent product."	5	electronics

I download books for kindle on it to read, I check my email, play scrabble and Spider Solitaire on it, Use Evernote on it to input my work schedule, and other reminders, use it for work and so many other things.
I can even use it to pay bills. It is great. Now that the IPad 3 Has come out he wants one of those for himself.
I highly recommend IPads."	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	Couldn't be happier with my new Ipad. I have had an imac desktop & mac laptop for about 3 years now and debated if I needed another mac computer. I am so glad I took the plunge. It is so fast and make web surfing easier than ever.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Good new device, including the right work. We were pleased with branded packaging, I think this device will bring me a lot of pleasant moments	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"So excited!! I ordered the IPad 2 on Tuesday afternoon and it was received in my office on Friday morning!! So not expected. The product was packaged wonderfully and ready for use. There were no scratches or dents...nothing on it that I would be surprised of. Thank you for such a quick delivery. This will definitely give me time to familiarize myself prior to the start of my hiring season in the next couple of weeks!

The iPad is in wonderful condition. I am so glad that I ordered the Verizon version. The data package deals are not too bad and can be purchased directly from the iPad. The apps are super fun and the apps that I will use for my kids are not that expensive, between 2 and 5 dollars. A note to self would be that IBM Lotus notes is not immediately compatible with Mac. The installation looks as if it happens, but the id name does not install. There are Youtube videos with instructions, but I am not the most computer savvy so I do not necessary understand the instructions. Microsoft office works well and all other programs that I have installed.
Have a wonderful day!"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The product arrived right as as trading. There was a mistake on my part for the type of connection because I wanted to have purchased the 3G AT & T. The Iphone is great.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	Great product!  No regrets, easy to use. I use mine all day long. My great granddaughter is 3 and she plays games all the time. Plenty of free apps for her to be satisfied. Love my iPad!,,,	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I feel the ipad 2 is a great investment. It can do everything you would need a normal computer to do but a ton more. Its extremely fast and lightweight along with a long lasting battery life which I enjoy. Works perfect for students like myself and in the business field for my job and can finish normally huge assignments and projects in minutes. For $499 you get everything you pay for. The only con is I wish it had a flash player since it won't play certain videos. The ipad 2 is a must buy for any skeptics out there!!!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	purchased ipad as gift for friend as I had just received one, and was having so much fun with it.  She loves it.  She is better at using it, than I am already.  Would highly recommend it!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I've been using the iPad 2 for about 8 months after using the first generation iPad for a year.  The iPad 2 is sleeker, much thinner and lighter.  These are big differences if you plan on doing a lot of reading on the device and need to hold it for extended periods of time.  The camera is a nice-to-have addition.  The iPhone 4 has a better camera and is easier to use when taking pictures - the iPad is a bit bulky to use as a camera.  Also, for me, cellular connectivity is a must since I travel frequently and can't always rely on a WiFi signal.  Cellular data plans are about $25/month, so if you don't need it, you can save a fair bit of money.  I might still recommend getting the device with the cellular antenna - you can enable it when you need it and cancel data plans when you don't.  Lastly, the question of white or black face... while white is a new option with iPad 2, I actually find the black frame preferable, especially when viewing video content.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I cancelled this unit when I realized I am not an AT&T nor a Verizon subscriber. My new wifi IPAD is great and works with my Verizon MIFI modem/router.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"My wife just bought an iPad 2 and I had the Transformer Prime (Android Platform).  I have researched for quite a long time before I bought my Prime (since returned) and actually had THREE Android tablets that all just did not cut it for me.  If you are on a lower budget, than certainly there are MANY Android tablets out there.  If you have the funds, I highly recommend the Apple iPad 2 as it is about the the best ""overall"" tablet out there.  Whether you like Apple or Steve Jobs history or politics, the iPad 2 really is a quality machine.  Nothing is perfect, and nothing will please everybody, but in comparing devices, I now have the experience with both platforms and will pick iPad as the best of the two.  For the average user, that being the non-technical, non-programmer type, and the person NOT looking for a tablet to replace a PC or laptop, the iPad 2 is a wonder.  Yes, it sure has different operating system and is ""closed"" compared to Android.  Yes, it does not support Java or Flash, but these are small issues. If you MUST have Java or Flash, or ""hate"" Apple, then no matter what anybody says, you will not like any reviews of the iPad 2.  If you are a regular ""Joe"" or ""Janet"", then read carefully all of the reviews and see that the iPad is a great unit if you can afford the extra dollars.  In a few weeks, the iPad 3 is likely announced and the prices for the remaining iPad 2's will likely decreases.  When that happens grab one immediately.  Of course, if you have the money, might want to consider the iPad 3.  People seem to get personal about an Apple product, either love them or hate them.  I have no bias, I own an Android Phone and will likely keep it.  I own an Ipod Touch and will probably keep it.  Since I have an Ipod and have had one for years (since they came out) I am familiar with iTunes and the iTunes Store.  If you are one of these people, you will find the interface of the iPad 2 familiar to you. Almost every application I used on the iPad 2 (my wifes) as compared to the Android devices was better.  Yahoo and SKYPE Video chat was far superior.  I did not use the camera on the iPad 2, but then again, a camera on a tablet is of NO importance to me.  Ease of use and quality are, and I choose (now) the iPad 2.  I simply like the Apple OS on a tablet better than Android. A huge difference I found with the iPad 2 over Android, is that with the default Android Sync program, I could not SEND an email from my exchange.  I could RECEIVE only.  After finding this out, and searching online, it is common issue and you need to download a third party SYNC program to accomplish this.  The iPad 2 works flawlessly out of the box sending and receiving exchange emails. I almost bought an iPad 2 in the beginning, and after three different Android units, am certainly going to purchase the iPad (2 or 3).  Things might just work out better anyway now, that a new iPad will be announced shortly.

*****update: I did purchase an iPad 2 on March 7 after the price was lowered by $100. I can safely state again that this is a fabulous device and I highly recommend. If you want a quality built tablet that can do pretty much all you would need, see if you can pick up an iPad 2 32 or 64 gb one before they are all gone."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	With my iPad 2. This thing is great. It's fast and fun. My daughter plays on it and I can literally replace my computer with it. So happy I got this.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I had an IPod 4G and it was amazing. I have never owned an Apple product before, I was so impressed with the touch that I sold it to upgrade to the Ipad2 could not be more happy with my decision. I use this device for browsing the web and playing appa which are amazing and second to none as far as quality and selection. I got this device at a killer price from amazon. The only remorse I have is that Apple will have a better device in a matter of months, but that is battle you will never win.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Ok, I can't say this item really needs a review, I think everyone pretty much knows the iPad is the master of the tablets.  I paid full price for my 64gb iPad and I don't regret it, even as long as it took me to save up for it.  I love getting digital copies of movies (like from the bluray discs you were already going to buy) and putting them on this bad boy to take wherever I want.  Not only can I enjoy it, but with an AV adapter cord I can plug it up to any HDTV and entertain everyone.

Obviously the apps are awesome.  There practically is an app for everything.  My biggest consideration in getting the iPad over an ereader was the amount of books you have access to.  On an iPad, you have access to all the iBooks, Kobo books, B&N nook books, and amazon kindle books through their own app.  Just recently I found one negative thing about having an iPad over a kindle.  I'm not talking about the fire either, because I really don't know enough about the fire to compare point for point, I'm just talking ebooks here.  The Kindle lets you borrow one book a month I believe it is for free (the kindle version ones that are listed as $0.00) if you are an amazon prime member.  Until recently, I wasn't a prime member and I wasn't disappointed until I found out that the iPad app for kindle doesn't offer the free borrowing of books unless you have an actual kindle. This may change some day if enough people complain, but as of right now, it isn't offered.  So if you are fine with paying for all of your books or you aren't willing to pay to be a prime member, then you have access to more books on an ipad.  Oh another cool thing is that you can download the overdrive app which you can rent digital books or audiobooks from your local library with your library card for free.  I love the audiobooks because I'm sure you know how expensive they are to buy, and unless I know for sure its a good book, I'm not willing to drop $20-$45 on an audiobook.

As for the internet on the iPad, browsing is a breeze, saving pages and bookmarking is a breeze.  The only thing is it does have some problems connecting to little mom and pop wif signals for some reason.  Its a known problem and I imagine the iPad3 will be better at this.  Other than that there are no complaints from me for the internet.

Printing from the iPad is so cool, too.  Even if you don't have an airprint printer, you can still find an app to print to almost any printer through wifi.  I haven't found one yet that I couldn't print on using Print Bureau.  Its really cool and after you figure out how to use it, its pretty simple too.  I can even print to my huge commercial printer/scanner/network fax machine at work.

I also love the adapters for cameras that lets you easily plug and transfer pictures/video directly to the iPad to send or post somewhere online.

If you have an iPod or iPhone, the charger that comes with the iPad is much stronger, and charges your other apple idevices much faster than with the chargers that came with them.
Overall very happy with my purchase!!!

I wanted to add an update, my schoolwork is online and I did find a way around the adobe flash problem so that I can access all of my school assignments and take tests from my iPad.  It's like a Firefox app, at least it syncs with Firefox, but it is called mercury. No flash problems =)"	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"Well, well, well, I finally bought an iPad. I was originally against it and bought the Asus Transformer first. It's not the greatest thing in the world, but the operating system and features are good in their own way. I might one day sell it and buy a Prime, since I like certain things about Android better. The main part that I don't like is the speed it operates at. (Lags a lot). But this is not about Android; it's about the iPad.
Ok, so the main reason that I was against the iPad and Apple products was it's use of slave children to make them and the exclusivity of the operating system. Slave children part? Still an issue. But the main reason I ended up buying one was the promise of Apple of making textbooks for college available on them. I had waited so long for it, too. How convenient is that? No more aching back and such. SSOOOOOOOO nice! And the exclusivity of the operating system? It's honestly not as bad as people had made it out to be. For the most part, things work really well in all aspects for the iPad and there's really only a few websites that I have gone to that don't play videos. I don't play flash games, so that's not an issue. But for reals, the iPad has the best apps and they're tailored specifically for it. The best example is Splashtop, which remotely accesses your computer. It certainly is NOT optimized for the Transformer. The greatest thing is that I can actually watch movies streamed from my computer in bed! When it comes to the processing power, I have been told that the components are the same for both of my tablets, but the iPad plays streaming video a whole lot better. And it also does just about everything better.....except for the widgets. Why can't Apple design widgets for the iPad??? That's why I like the operating system of Android better, plus you can customize it better and surf files better and generally get a more user-oriented experience. Once again though, the apps for iPad ARE better and there ARE more of them, (though not a whole lot). It quickly does hit a brick wall and the apps fall dramatically in quality. Most of the apps that are truly useful, you will find on both. Itunes though is a b*tch and I truly do not enjoy using it. This cuts back to the point I made that files are easier to work with on Android products. If you can climb successfully up the iTunes learning curve, you will do well, but you shouldn't enjoy it, if my experience is anything to go on. So, that's about all I have to rant about right now. If you're like me, you'll just blow your money and get an Apple product AND and Android product. Both good, but for now, the iPad is MUCH better. I swear, sometimes I just want to hold it and fall asleep with it. Oh, and just as a quick afterthought, the next generation of iPads need more quick-access buttons, just like Android. There should be a menu button, back button, (that doesn't just take you back to the main screen), and a quick-switch multitasking button. If they did this, the iPad would truly reign supreme. Thanks for a great product!"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Woman falls in love with a machine.  Sounds like the starting line of a trailer for a science fiction movie?  Nope... sounds like REAL life!

B0013FRNKG	The iPad is an amazing product. I ordered this iPad 2 from Karen Electronics through Amazon.  I got to use my Amazon gift cards toward my purchase. I ordered around 11:00 am and was notified that the iPad had shipped about 2:00. I received the iPad today. 24 hours after it was shipped. Great service. I also saved $50 on my purchase by getting the white iPad instead of the black one. Very positive experience and I love my iPad,	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I really enjoy my iPad. At times I have a hard time putting it down. All the apps are great and there are many addictive games. Great for browsing the internet the only downfall I see is that the iPad is not Flash compatible which makes some websites hard to view. Other than that I got exactly what I expected.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"The absence of Adobe means I cannot retire the windows system yet. It is not Adobe but the producers of products and the cable company offering only those products.

Now that we got rid of the only negative, if you have an iphone the learning curve is nil. A few exceptions; the Safari screen is a tad different. Some apps are grainy in the 2x mode. Response time can be a tad slow in comparison to other devices on the same Wi-Fi.

I actually played with dedicated book readers before the purchase of this device as that is the primary goal. The top reason for iPad 2 over the readers is the viewing surface. Oh sure on a reader you can pick you r font. However you cannot pick your screen size.  As long as this is my reader of choice I though ""oh well why not make it the computer as well."" So being familiar with the iphone there would be almost no learning curve.  I picked the max memory (not that I will use more than a fraction of it) just because if for some reason I wanted more in the future  I would not have to worry if it was upgradable or not. I intend to use the blazes out or this iPad 2 until the technology no longer exists. So far I have only used the Wi-Fi part as one little security password and it was actively accessing the net.  Will pick 3g if traveling is in my plans.  So far there are just too many free hot spots. I may be over planning but it gives me peace of mind to know this animal can communicate with both systems and has plenty of memory.

Mean time I am having a great time using this system primarily as a reader.
As a reader this by the way does not require Adobe Flash.

Owning an iPad as playing around with its potential remids me of the saying form `four quartets' by t.s. eliot

We shall not cease from exploration
And the end of all our exploring
Will be to arrive where we started
And know the place for the first time."	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	Love the ipad as it is so easy to navigate and very handy to use anywhere around the house. It is lightweight and turns on fast. The OS is easy to use as well and also easy to navigate.

B0013FRNKG	"This was an unexpected gift. In truth I'm buying Fires for my own kids (love them) and intended one day to get one myself. So when I was given the ipad it was a serious shock. That said I use it at my school where things are mostly blocked. It's so vivid and I can hold it up close and see it so well. The screen is vibrant. I prefer the Fire for my kids actually and wish I had a set of these to teach with. Too bad my school in a poverty area can't wrangle that.
All I can say is the thought of not having this for kids seems luddite."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I figured the Ipad 2 was overrated, but after receiving one for Christmas, I have to say I love it.  Working it is very intuitive and easy, and it seems like you can do nearly anything on it. Some of the things I do on my ipad: check and write mail, surf the web, send IMs, watch movies, take, and edit pictures, listen to my Itunes library or Pandora/Slacker radio, read books and magazines, play games, listen to podcasts at work, skype with my family, keep contacts/notes to myself, etc. There are so many cool apps, a lot of them free. There's probably a lot I haven't discovered yet, but with what I have so far I'm very happy. I take it to work everyday, plug in my earbuds, and it keeps me entertained whilst working a boring, tedious office job. After checking it out, my coworkers all want one too. I highly recommended it.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	This is definitely worth the money. I don't have to be running to my computer. It is very portable, so unlike your desktop computer, you can take it to any room. Unless you are doing a lot on the actual road away from WiFi, there is not much reason to get one with 3G. Between IMessage and FaceTime it makes it worth it for my 5 1/2 year old daughter to keep in touch with Grammy and Grandpa, who live in a different state. She likes to talk to them while eating dinner, so I would rather have her eat near this than my computer.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I really wanted an ipad alternative tablet.  After reviewing all the possibilities,  I bought the ipad2 with 64 gig.  All the non-apple tablets had way too many horror stories, both from a hardware / software and a customer support point of view.

The drawbacks to an apple operating system were vastly out weighed by the problems reported with the alternatives.

Do youself a favor and buy the apple.  You'll be glad you did."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I bought the iPad for my wife. If you're not a Mac user, it might be a little difficult to get used to, at first, as it was for her. However, it's well worth the learning effort. After an initial slow, but fun orientation and adjustment period, she loves it. It's fun, attractive, and pretty funciontal. I found it was not good for doing my homework asssignments and heavy duty work, because of its small size and onscreen keyboard (not effecctive if you really know how to type). However, once we added a bluetooth keyboard, I thought that it really could be a good ""only"" computer for anyone but a hard core document writer. I certainly would consider it for myself, as a travel and meeting device, but I'm still not giving up the big comfortable screen on my desk in the office. One more important note. Customer service is superb to any I've used anywhere in my life. Representatives are friendly, responsive, well-educated and just good folks. Thanks, Mac."	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	In November of 2011 I bought the Amazon Fire mostly because I wanted to stream their Prime movies.  The screen for movies and tv shows was fantastic though the wifi connection would keep dropping in the middle of streaming. The more I used the Fire the more I realized that it wasn't able to give me what I wanted.  It did not have a large enough amount of device itself storage space,I could not turn the backlight down low enough to make it comfortable for me to read, I could not download the BN reading app to read my BN book library, and the screen really wasn't large enough to comfortably browse the internet or read magazines.  I started looking at the Ipad 2 and after what I saw from a co-worker's IPAD I gifted my Fire to my sister and bought my own Ipad.  I absolutely love it!  It has given me everything that I wanted - most specifically the fact that I can have the Amazon reading apps and BN reading app on the device and can read both bookstore's library on the same device.  I had purchased the 16 mb but two days later upgraded to the 64 mb.  The backlight can be turned down to being almost off, browsing is great, reading my emails is easier now. The wifi connection is solid up in my room where the Fire would keep dropping the connection. I am amazed at how much you can do with this device with the different apps.  It is always with me!  True it is heavier than the Fire - it's more like reading a hardback book, but the print is big and the backlight is softer on the eyes.  Also true is the fact that I now cannot watch the Amazon Prime movies and tv shows, but ITunes has a lot to offer even though you have to pay for it.  Small trade-off in my opinion since I am mostly a book person - not a movie person.  Now if Amazon were to make a bigger Fire and take care of some of the issues I mentioned above - the Fire could definitely give the IPAD a run especially having the Instant Prime Video behind them but for now I would recommend the IPAD 2 over the Kindle Fire.  p.s.  My sister really likes the Fire and is very satisfied with it.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I ordered the IPAD2 3 days ago for my mother, 75 years old.
She really enjoys it and like how user friendly it is. She spent hours on it already, listening to music and using the apps I installed for her.
I would recommend the Ipad2 for everyone that is not really concerned about the limitations (no flash, limited customization, necessity to go through Itunes for everything...)
Display is nice, sound quality is good and it is really easy to use for older people."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The iPad arrived within the one day shipping by Amazon.  The packing was appropriate for this item.  I find the Apple line of consumer electronics to be very user friendly. The software is intuitive--it does and goes where you would expect it to if you were doing the same process manually. This is my first exposure to the iPad.  I highly recommend it as an addition, or replacement to other computer products.  The screen keyboard takes getting use to. It is a light touch.  I anticipated this, amd so I am using an AmazonBasics Bluetooth Keyboard for Apple iPad/iPhone. There was no contact with the seller as this was fulfilled by Amazon, but I would buy from this seller again based on a good product delivered in the described package. Buy an iPad, you will not be disappointed.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I can probably go into a dissertation about what i like with the iPad 2, but I'll just say that it is reliable, doesn't crash or perform updates everyday and does the basic tasks I need it for.  If you are debating on this or the Galaxy, it comes down to personal preference really.  If you are looking into a Kindle Fire, my daughter has one, and I can tell you there is a reason it costs $199 because it is not made as well, just the basics of using it are not as easy or efficient as the iPad.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"This Ipad 2 is great.  I would strongly suggest going with more space if you are going to download videos or applications.  The icloud only does music/photos.  I submitted inquiry to seller and quick response was followed addressing my questions.

B0013FRNKG	"A year ago, nobody had an iPad. Then Apple sold 15 million of them in just nine months, creating a whole new category of technology product. The iPad may have become, in the words of Steve Jobs, ""the most successful consumer product ever launched.""

It turns out that a lot of people saw the iPad's appeal: it's a supremely portable device that's well suited for checking your e-mail, surfing the Web, playing games, reading books and other stuff you get off the Internet, and even for getting work done. Kids and the elderly have embraced it.

It's awfully hard to follow such a massive success, but that's the task set out for Apple's new iPad 2, which goes on sale Friday. At least the iPad 2 has this going for it: the original model caught the technology industry so flat-footed that only now are true competitors beginning to appear.

Those competitors will now face a new iteration of the iPad, one that's faster, smaller, and lighter than the model introduced a year ago--all while retaining the $499 entry price that has proven all but impossible for Apple's competitors to match. It's almost unfair.

A game of inches (and ounces)

Call it Jobs's Law if you like: The latest version of any Apple product is likely to be thinner and lighter than its predecessor. And so it is with the iPad 2. The size difference between the original iPad and the iPad 2 may seem slight, but that's only because we're dealing with such small products to begin with. But for products this small, every ounce and fraction of an inch counts.

The iPad 2 measures 7.31 by 9.5 by 0.34 inches, and weighs in at 1.33 pounds (in the case of the Wi-Fi-only version, that is--the AT&T and Verizon 3G versions are .01 and .02 pound heavier). That means Apple shaved .17 pound off the Wi-Fi version and .26 to .27 pound off the 3G version. The iPad 2 is also .16 inch narrower, .06 inch shorter, and .16 inch thinner than the original iPad.

A matter of small degrees, to be sure, until you consider the percentage change: the iPad 2 is roughly two-thirds the thickness of the original iPad, and 88 percent of its weight (83 percent when comparing 3G models). Pick up an iPad 2 after handling an original iPad, and you'll notice the difference right away. This is a lighter, thinner device."	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"I took a long time deciding which tablet to buy and had narrowed down to Motorola Xoom, Sony Tablet S and iPad 2. I tried out all 3 and a few more tablets before choosing the iPad 2. I bought the iPad because-
1. Navigation was smooth with the iPad. With all other tablets, I noticed that the tablet would not react to the touch every once in a while.
2. The tablet is for my wife. iOS is much more intuitive than Android when it comes to tablets. the complexity of use of Android is fine for techies, though.
3. Assurance of OS upgrade. I know that my iPad 2 would be compatible with future versions of iOS and that Apple would allow free upgrades. At the time of my purchase, I wasn't so sure about Android based tablets (looking at how many Android based cellphones don't get timely OS upgrades)
4. Flaws in other tablets. Every other tablet has flaws, which is pretty disappointing. Xoom is good, but they don't deliver what they promise (Read up on Xoom users' agony over the micro SD unusability for over 6 months). Sony tablet doesn't come with 3G.

Reasons why I took so long before buying the iPad:
1. Dependence on iTunes
2. No SD input
3. Heavy price of accessories (like the one for connecting iPad to a TV)

But in the end, it was worth it. Now I rarely open my PC; I just find it too bulky and slow now. :)"	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"My wife bought the 32GB Wi-Fi with 3G black iPad 2 for Christmas.  I couldn't have been any happier!  This is an amazing machine.  I absolutely love it.  I travel alot so I will primarily use this for watching movies on the plane and surfing the web in airports...so I thought.  Once I opened the package, this machine has been in my lap ever since.  I downloaded a handful of my favorite apps, uploaded a couple movies, and threw my laptop to the side!  The Ipad doesn't get hot like laptops do, which is awesome.  Also, it's so light weight and fast over my Wi-fi.

For people who just have to have ""flash"" just download the iSwifter app and pay the $5 for it.  It was well worth it.  When I'm browsing the web and cant access a site due to it's flash content, I just input that same URL into iswifter and it's like magic.  This is by far my best electronic device I have ever owned.  I never knew that the apple interface was so easy to use.  The iPad 2 is making me throw away my blackberry phone so that I can upgrade to an iPhone 4 or 4s.

I would say that other companies still have a lot to learn from apple, so far the ipad has been a replacement from my laptop at home, I can answer mails, browse the internet, see movies and all I even move pictures to the ipad to be modified ( applications are cheaper and good at making basic modifications in pictures), it is all I ever wanted.. So if it is expensive , yes!!! is it worth it?? Yes!!! every penny .. Support is amazing!!! I would buy another one for my kids??? already !!!"	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	I got the iPad 2 in white and 64 gb with wifi+Verizon 3G and I absolutely love it! I suggest getting the biggest one you can so you don't have to worry about running out of space! I was worried about the white only after reading a few negative reviews about finding it distracting and I haven't found that to be the case for me. However, the screen protector I bought does not seem to fit as well as my mom's (same everything except hers is in black). I don't know if it was just a problem with that protector or if there is a slight size difference. Other than that no issues!	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"I have wanted an iPad for a little over a year now, and I finally have one. I'm actually writing this review with it right now! A lot of people I know have criticized the iPad for being like the iPhone or iPod Touch, and I have to say while a lot of features are similar to my 3GS (don't own a touch), there are a lot of features which differ. I have had so much fun typing the screen of the iPad, I spent hours with the yahoo app talking to one of my friends while I installed my other apps. I am a college student and plan to use the iPad instead of my computer at school so I don't kill my back walking to class. I'm not the most tech savvy, but I know my way around the iPad from having my 3GS and love the simplicity of the device.  Besides, you can't beat the awesome of having almost full functionality of web pages through safari on the iPad. I continually get frustrated with my phone's version. I am not a fully converted Apple person since I still own a Sony Vaio and prefer the solidarity of The Sims 3 on PC. I also used a Mac last semester in school, and I just couldn't get used to it.

I also REALLY love how much faster the iPad 2 is compared to the 3GS. It may not be a fair comparison but I also added 6 gigs if ram to my laptop so I could have a faster machine. I hate lag.

Oh! Not having adobe flash hasn't fazed me one bit. I don't really understand the argument about that one but the iPad has no trouble playing YouTube videos in safaris browser. It doesn't take you to the YouTube app like on the iPhone. I almost bought the Sony tablet which was recently released but I didn't feel like getting all my apps all over again since  I already own popular ones like angry birds. iTunes on the iPad has similar functionality to the program on the pc, and I'm assuming Mac, and I out most of the songs from my husbands accout in here. I also have never used a honey comb based tablet so iOS and iPad I went. iOS 5 installed in under 30 minutes for me.

I have accidentally hit the back button in here twice with the iPad-the screen is extremely sensitive-and I don't think I can leave anything more useful for others considering the iPad, so I'll wrap it up. I got the 32 gig iPad in black and I've had a hard time putting it down. I'm also using a reflex series Otterbox and never plan on removing it from the iPad. I'm leaving a review for that next...but stop reading this! Get your iPad if you want one!"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"You are there, standing in the middle of the electronics department, credit card in hand, about to spend hundreds of dollars on a touch pad you can trust to be worth the money, and a good product. The store clerks are saying different things to you about each pad, and you don't know who to trust. Ladies and Gentlemen, the I Pad 2 is the correct item for you! It consists of app selection, optional WiFi, and other sources such as 4g. Coasting around the range of $800.00, I would suggest this particular system over any of the other available touch pads. I tried another once. I didn't like it. I would choose ipad2 over a regular i pad. why? many reasons.
.It is faster
.it looks better based on the fact that it is so thin.
.Its the newest version, so why not take a go before it gets outdated?
The following are my views on this remarkable contraption. Also, I'm just going to call the I pad 2 an i pad just to make it easier. Just know that the I pad and I pad 2 are 2 different products. Sometimes, i will call it an i pad 2, but just so no one gets confused while reading this, there's a fact. Hope they help!

First facts: This was a bummer, but based on Apple restrictions, the i pad 2 does not have flash, so it can't play online games or run certain programs that need flash. There is also no place for discs or flash drives, so you can't download saved work such as the data on flash drives or discs. You can't download programs like Microsoft office programs on this particular item, which is not fortunate, not to mention the fact that it doesn't connect to the printer. Hopefully some day it will evolve into better stats.

Camera: For the most part i like the camera, but based on the fact i haven't seen or interacted with many other i pads except my own, which has a crooked, bury camera, it wasn't the best for me, but the other touch pad i owned had a horrible camera. I don't know how the other cameras look on the i pad 2 because i don't bother to put pictures of myself out into the public on the store tester i pads, so, keep the camera idea something to check on before buying. On the camera though you can make it look straigt ahead like a regular video camera or make it face the way you are looking at the screen, so it flips around depending on what kind of picture you want. I give MY experience on the camera a B grade

App selection: Great apps! Many apps are free, but 1 app's full version wasn't free on the i pad like it was on my other pad. I still don't think that should be a problem. Also the apps appear with fewer selections on the screen based on certain categories then my other touch pad, which appeared in a long list that was helpful. Although i would beleive that all together the ipad 2 has a wider selection of apps. Unlike some touch pads, The i pad 2 offers netflix, and many other apps that are one of the reasons i got the i pad in the first place. Great quality. I give the apps a A grade.

Battery: The battery doesn't last very long. Sometimes, it last a long time, but for the most part, I always have it charging. This is a issue if i want to travel with it. I'm going to have to get a i pad car charger... Anyway, the battery issue may just be with only MY i pad 2 but I'm not really sure. I would give this category a C or B grade, but it has some work to do before it reaches an A.

App download speed: The apps for the most part download quickly, but there has been some times where the apps don't make any progress with loading so i usually have to delete it (and pray it will actually download) and download it again. In the end i always get ti worked out but its like, ""Come ON!"" you know? I give this category a A for it's amazing speed!

WiFi quality: I love this category. Mine plays most H.D. videos and can just download apps from its app store rather then having to connect it to the computer to download things. That i can really appreciate. I can open up nearly all web-sights just the way they would appear on the internet unlike my last touch pad. I would say in order to get the full i pad 2 experience WiFi is a must-have. I give WiFi a A for great function!

Speakers: Lets put it this way, the speakers... they could use some work. Sometimes when i have it to the maximum sound it is hard to hear. That is not something that i favor based on the fact that the i pad is like, 40% sound, but i still like the product. If you have this problem i suggest going to a quieter area or plugging in ear phones to assure you get the most out of your money.

Covers: I don't have a smart-cover. Perhaps the smart-covers do save the battery and make the screen sleep when you put the cover over it, but i have a cover that's not a smart-cover and it is just fine. As long as you turn it off when not in use for long periods of time any covers should work. Note that the cover should fit nicely around the i pad 2, that way, it is a better buy and protects the i pad more. i would suggest a case to help protect it and make a nice little stand for it. You can't exactly rate a cover because there are many different ones, but here is my rate on how important a cover is to have to me. A B. Its optional, but a good idea.

App Usage speed: Most of the apps i use are great, fast, functional, and don't have jerky movements. Take Talking Friends apps for example. They are fun, functional, and fast. Just how it should be, not to mention very clever. There isn't much to say about this particular category, but let me just say it deserves a A or B for nice function.

Note where there should have been another Category view: I haven't had really any interaction with a regular i pad, so i can't say if the i pad 2 is really ""new and improved"", but i can say its good for me and very fast. Keep that in mind.

Video and Photo booth: I love making videos, so i was happy to hear that the i pad 2 came with a camera ready to make some videos! It is a personal highlight. Also photo booth is fun. seeing what your pictures look like in x-ray vision, and flipped, and so much more. I really liked that. too bad you can't film videos in photo booth :( Also note that both of these are the free apps that come right when you get the i pad. the video is connected to camera app.

Personal Favorites: I love the i pad 2, but my favorite features about it, are the following:
.Its very thin and simple, which is very neat.
.The apps are great and so are their function.
.A i pad without WiFi is a very sad i pad.
.Videos and photo booth.
.speed!-------> ZOOM

GRAND CLOSING..
These are all my opinions of different category in the i pad 2. Comment if there is more you want to know about the i pad 2 and i will see if i have an answer to add to this review for you. Thanks for reading! Hope it helped!!"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Wow, what a fantastic piece of equipment.  After having an iPhone, it is very easy to use.  Wife and I will be fighting over it for sure.  Also, item shipped and was received promptly.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I bought the iPAD 2 for my wife for Christmas. She is SOO happy with it and so am I. I plan to buy one for myself. Great product and a great deal from Amazon.com.

B0013FRNKG	"I admit when I first heard about Apple making an iPad I was skeptical about how practical the device would be.  Fast forward to the present, and having used the iPad 2 for 2 months, I can honestly say it has transformed my digital life in our increasingly digital world.  My desktop and laptop have been gathering dust since acquiring the iPad 2.

It is the ultimate way to interact with just about all things digital.  With the right apps, you can do just about anything you can on a laptop, television, and gaming system, all in one sleek, stylish, and utterly portable device!  On a regular basis I use my iPad 2 to surf the web, compose and read e-mails, open and edit Microsoft Office documents, watch movies, listen to my MP3 collection, take and browse photos, make financial transactions, and play games that are just as good as what I can play on a computer or dedicated video game system.

I'm hard pressed to come up with a single thing I dislike about the iPad 2."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	There's not much more to add to the benefit of owning a Ipad.  I bought this for my wife's birthday and the possibilities it allows are limitless.  Couple the Ipad or any apple product you have with Apple TV in your home and you have the capability to eradicate cable television and their monopoly from your list of home services.  Great product.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Loving my ipad! I got it pretty fast? Highly recomended
It was what i paid for. Desde venezuela caracas. It came with the newest software"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	In one word, super, does everything as advertised. My wife (X-MAS gift) loves it, she takes it every where. It worth every penny.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Ok, I got the latest
IPad for Christmas, and I'd asked for a Kindle.
I am 60 yrs old
And technology basically is leaving me in the dust.  Sometimes it is
So stressful that I give up.
THIS IS A GREAT THING !!!!

After finding out how clever and
Fun an iPad is (& how unendingly fun it
Is to explore and play games on!),
I basically only am using my laptop for long documents!

Fearful Microsoft folks:

YOU NEED AN IPAD!"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I purchased this iPad2 for my husband for Christmas. I was at first hesitant to purchase online and not from a local retailer. However, I was thoroughly impressed. The iPad 2 came brand new still in a shrink-wrapped box. The device has worked flawlessy for the last two weeks. I would recommend this seller to my friends.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The iPad 2 is an excellent tablet.  It does everything I expected and with a few free apps does even more.  I sure am glad I didn't settle for something less.  The seller delivered very quickly and as ordered.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I won't hash out the technical specs and details like other reviewers have probably done a few times before me.

I love my iPad 2. My girlfriend just got me one for our anniversary. Funny thing is she just got one from her mom for Christmas at my suggestion. So now we both have one.

She just recently got wifi at work, too. She takes hers to work. She tends to call me about 3-4 times a day (at least it feels like that) and now she can call me on her iPad using Facetime, so she can see me as well. I don't really know how I feel about that feature sometimes, but it's pretty cool. I have other friends with iPads and iPhones and stuff, so we can all Facetime just like a house phone. It takes a little more effort to use it (just like Skype), but it's a really cool native app to the iPad. The camera quality is a bit to be desired. I think my Mac has a better camera than the iPad.

Anyway, I'm not giving a review of Facetime. The iPad 2 is fast. The screen is pretty large compared to my iPod touch and my Droid X. It works well as a reader. The games work well on it. I've even used it as a drawing tablet a few times. I would link a photo I've drawn in my review, but I'm not sure I can do that.

The browser works just as well as it does on my Mac and my iPod touch. It's not the best thing in the world, but it works well.

Mail is still a problem for me. I can't get my Yahoo to work and I can't actually divulge why. I know the reason why and I'm not willing to fix it because it could be a slight security risk. Gmail works fine for me. I can't get my work e-mail to work either, but I haven't messed with it enough to really determine the reason just yet.

The iPads are great to have around to watch Netflix and things like that. Especially when there is a toddler that wants to watch something and everyone else is watching something on the big screen.

Finally, the iPads are very expensive. So far my experience with Apple in the past few years is that they build a quality product and it tends to be worth it. I hope they continue this trend. I can't say whether or not it was worth the cost as I didn't shell out the money this time. I can only say that I'm enjoying the product and I'm very happy to have it."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Really love mine, easy to use and great apps, this is my first apple product. Was scared I would not like it. But overall not bad	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I'll be the first to admit, I love toys.  Gadgets, gizmos, anything electronic will catch my attention.  THese toys are great, but my fascination is not longterm.  Too soon after I spend my money on the latest ""must have"" the toy finds its way to the shelf as I move on.  I held off on purchasing an iPad2 because of the cost and because I was fearful it would spend $730 for something I would later stash away nver to use again.  Nothing could be further from the truth.

I've had my iPad2 for about three months now and I love it more each day.  I'm using it everyday for several hours.  I use it for my work, and for fun.  I listen to music, watch movies, and play with fun, educational apps.  I have work-related apps.  I use it for my local government role so I do not need to print paper forms and other official documents.  I buy apps but I love the free ones.  It is a challenge to find useful apps for free.  I can manage my investments with it.  I can use Google Earth and travel the world.

I no longer consider my iPad2 just a toy.  It is an intregal part of my life as I can quickly check emails and get headline news.  I can follow sports teams and have my music collection.  It is awkward to bring along during hikes, but I do have it in my car for the music.  I have podcasts and iBooks.  It will never replace my laptop, it will not replace my Kindle, but I cannot see myself without my iPad2.

I strongly recommend the iPad2 to anyone who is even remotely considering buying one.  You will be amazed at the number of uses you will find for it."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"The iPad will change the way humans live. It's as simple as that. A few years back you saw stage prop devices like this on Star Trek TNG! Now they are here.

This is in the same league as Wheat, Fire, Steel, Flight, Anti-biotics, Sails, Steam.
You are on the ground floor of a new age and a new civilisation. This WILL reduce the use of paper and oil. This will make humans much more efficient. Old paper and oil based industries will suffer but that is how it goes...
If you can find them, there are apps for a wide array of uses. I can read Conrad, Wharton, Fitzgerald while waiting for a plane or work. I can know where I am in 700 cities and what's around me. I can make a video call.
You get the idea. It's only going to get better!

I like my iPad.

Get as much memory as you can afford. Bigger is better. Get the Griffin Survivor case and the Kensington  sling pack. There may be a way to use flash memory as well.

Highly recommended."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Gave this to our son for Christmas. So far, he seems to be very happy with it. Used it during his whole visit! So, we're happy that he's happy, lol.
Now he is looking for a good keyboard, any suggestions?"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The iPad2 is all that is is advertised to be.  There is so much that you can do with it and it is light and portable...I find that I rarely need to pull out the laptop!  Each day I am finding new ways to use it and that makes it that much more interesting and fun.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	i was very impressed at the speed in which i received my ipad. it was a last minute gift idea and it arrived before christmas.  i was very pleased	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"once again apple gives us something great!

i bought this ipad because of work actually. I work in a hospital and its great to be able to access electronic records/labs/orders quickly while doing rounds. Makes life a lot easier than finding a computer, logging on, then doing it. After work, I can use this if I'm out, sitting at home on the couch, showing off things to my friends, youtubing vids, facebook (stalking), and even watching movies.

The screen is beautiful, the weight is just right, and everything about it is so clean and perfect. I do wish the resolution could get a little higher as you can see a difference between it and the iphone4 screen, but i know thats something that will come in the ipad3. If you can wait, the ipad3 should be worth it as it will probably be the same price. If you can't wait, get this, you won't regret it!"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"This device, my iPad2 WiFi 64 GB a gift to myself on my birthday, the 24th of Dec. and for Christmas, is absolutely perfect for my needs:

1. Initial set up: The setup assistant worked painlessly and well only a few minutes after I took the iPad out of the box.

2. Spent days trying to connect the device to my home WiFi network. Could not seem to get it to connect. Why? My son had given me the WRONG password to unlock the network. When he finally remembered the correct password, I was able to connect my iPad2 to our WiFi network in a New York minute.

3. Not being a confident user of high tech, I was more than a little wary of setting up my mail on the iPad since it is always so easy just to access mail on my laptop and my Kindle Fire. I waited a few days before setting up the mail app. Silly me: I simply tapped to the Home page of the iPad2, then tapped on the Mail app, and then followed the setup steps on the screen. As we oldsters say, ""a piece of cake.""

 I always used to refer to using Apple computers, etc., as intuitively obvious, but they are better than that. The steps are more than intuitive; instead, they are OBVIOUS."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	So it doesn't have FLASH - clue here peeps ADOBE STOPPED SUPPORTING MOBILE FLASH. Gues HTML 5 or better will be new standard. The IPad 2 is still the BOSS of tablets PERIOD. Nothing performs as well ....NOTHING !  In short was a Apple hater ( still am) but wanted a smaller form factor than the laptops/net book areana. This replaced my laptop couldn't be happier.  Hate the limitations of Apple World thus have an Android phone (Motorola Droid Bionic used as mobile hotspot). All said n done HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !! Kindle Fire smaller very limited performance compared to the BOSS.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I was at first skeptical from the dealer I purchased from instead of going to an Apple store. I was pleasantly surprised when it showed up sooner than expected. I trusted Amazon for their merchant reliability rating and it payed off, again	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This one is user friendly and so easy to upload and down load everything you need. If you had the chance to get this one doit it's really worth it.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Product delivered in timely fashion and works great.  Wonderful christmas gift for my wife. She love s it. I would recommend this product to anyone.  She is all set up ready to go.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Holy Moly am I going to buy another one of these! One isn't enough for our family of five.

I haven't compared or looked at any other options. Mostly because this one was a gift to us from a grandmother who wanted to do face time with her grand kids.

I have never been a big apple fan because you have to deal with Itunes which is a bother. But it's been worth it to have an ipad. We love it.

Here is what I know about it- It is incredibly thin, extremely light, super fast, and it does amazing things.

You can use a Kindle to read but you can download the kindle software onto the ipad. You can buy a Nook or another pad and they may meet your minimum standards. However the Ipad does everything those will do and more.

Sure it's expensive but if I could afford it and I was wondering if I wanted to spend 'that kind of money' on an ipad because really a whatever/fill in the blank would do fine; I'd go ahead and get the ipad.

Well worth the money.
Enjoy."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I've had my iPad 2 32Gb WiFi for about 5 months now, and it's probably one of the best purchases I've ever made. Ease of use is above and beyond any computing device I've ever had. Yes it's mostly a ""consumption device"", but that's about 90% of what I do at home. And for the other 10% (sending email, shopping, etc) the various apps work terrific. I barely use my laptop now, and I've ceased bringing it on vacations with me since my iPad can handle everything I would need to do on the road, and does it for longer.

Some examples of how I've used it in the past few months:

- Sold/traded in all of my programming reference manuals and bought ePub or Kindle versions of them all. My library went from a couple of hundred pounds of books to something that I can carry around with me at all times in my Timbuk2 bag.

- Watched ""Prohibition"" Ken Burns mini-series on the plane to Key West with my girlfriend (that I easily transferred from my TiVo to my iPad). And while I was in the Keys I was able to browse online for activities and book day trips, find restaurants, etc. while tethered to my Android phone.

- Played Scrabble / Words with Friends regularly with friends that live all over the country.

- Read the news and check my email on it every morning.

- Purchase/download all books I needed for grad school.

- Used it for almost all of my Christmas shopping this year.

- Introduced my family to my girlfriends family using Facetime.

- Streamed music from iCloud/iTunes, SiriusXM and Pandora apps.

- Used as a cookbook multiple times.

- Watched movie on Netflix while plugged into the TV via HDMI in my hotel room on a business trip.

Enough said... the fact that I've barely put the thing down since I've owned it is the best endorsement I can give. =)"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Got The item in proper condation and the right time. The Item was in good working order and was what i had ordered.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	OK. Here it is. The IPAD 2 that came to the house via UPS was in a little box. Who knew that something so powerful would come in a non-descript brown box. I was tracking the travels and travails of my IPAD through the supplied tracker (I am grateful for this feature) and was literally waiting for the UPS guy to show, times are either 10:00AM or 3:00PM missed the ten AM. Guess what..... Was waiting at the front door at 3; UPS showed up and so did my IPAD. Opened the box up, stiffened my resolve to not mess around until the IPAD was fully charged. So hooked the IPAD up, and waited for a full 24 hours. AFTER that, configured the machine to the wireless internet and then commenced to download EVERYTHING. The IPAD is COOL. It goes EVERYWHERE and can do practically everything. And the really weird part about this whole thing is this....my daughter, who is 4, put a claim on MY IPAD?????? Uhhh...NO. The answer is GET YOUR OWN. Too funny; For real, we share. But she did put a claim on the IPAD. All right, 5 stars, the seller gets a thumbs up as well for making sure that the delivery parcel was NON-DESCRIPT and no other verbiage was on the box either to state what was in inside either - once again the seller get a thumbs on that. Anyways, Enthusiastic about how the purchase went down, the delivery and tracking as well the product itself.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	What a great little device!  I love everything about it so far...ease of use is great and I have not a single complaint so far other than maybe they should ship it with a screen saver applied instead of the cheap plastic you rip off and throw out.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This thing is amazing.  All the apps.  All the convenience.  So simple to use.  Would recommend it to anyone.  My wife loves it.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I got my Apple iPad for Christmas this year and i haven't been able to leave its side since. There are truly no limits when using it. I can create and edit any word documents I need for school, watch HD movies, listen to all my music, Skype/ FaceTime, quickly and easily download new songs/ apps/ videos, read books and magazines(mostly at no cost), take great looking pictures, play games... etc. The list goes on and on... and on. The only thing I have had any trouble with at all was installing the new update. I would recommend installing it before putting any media or info on it. It just makes the process alot longer and more frustrating. Reguardless, I think Apple has outdone themselves with this device. It is more than just an oversized/ overpriced iPod. I love my iPad.

ps. I recomend getting a Smart Cover.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Apple-iPad-2-Polyurethane-Smart-Cover-Gray-MC939LL-A/dp/B004QKJU56/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Apple iPad 2 Polyurethane Smart Cover - Gray (MC939LL/A)</a>&nbsp;It protects my beloved iPad very well and is worth more than what I paid for it.

Little smaller than i expected but that's because i never hold one before.
It is fast 16 Gig white color with aluminum back.
Very easy to use, 2 cams and it easy to switch between cams just press a button.
Any ways if you are thinking about buying one all i can say you will probably love it too.
Just one thing you should know about Apple limits with watching videos on web sites and installing different programs, it won't let you do that."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The I Pad 2 was a gift for my daughter who is a sophmore in college.

Ordering it on Amazon was easy as ell and we got a great price and did not have to wait in a line.

B0013FRNKG	"Ok now Im not rich so I don't have a Xoom and a Touchpad and a Tab and everything else to compare it too, but I can give you my review of the iPad itself.
I looked into all of the other tablets too and from what I have found, the iPad was the best. While it does not have flash, I have so far found that to be no big deal anyway. if you absolutely have to have flash for something, look it up on your computer.

Typing:
Typing on it is not terrible but its not my favorite. I had an iPod touch and was used to typing on a touch screen so that part wasn't a big deal to me. The touchscreen itself is great and is very accurate as to actually registering the button you hit. This review is written on my laptop though because I knew that I wouldnt want to type several paragraphs on the iPad. For chatting on facebook or searching the internet and stuff like that though, it is actually really great.

Cameras:
Now the cameras are not 100% what I expected them to be. They are decent but are still grainy. Granted I haven't taken pictures and then viewed them in normal size yet, so the graininess is just being blown up to iPad size. It might get better if it is shrunken down but so far it seems grainy to me. Really though, its better than not having a camera at all.

Apps:
Photobooth seems to be the most fun app for showing off the iPad to other people. it was nice that it came with it instead of having to buy it. All of the other apps pretty much work like the iPod touch's apps do, and I love the iPod touch. The email is a lot nice to use now that it is updated.
Garageband is great! for $5 its the cheapest and best audio recording software you can get. It was the first thing that I bought and have been playing with it ever since. I like that you can play the instruments right on the iPad and record and edit it all.
Safari is a really great and simple browser and it feels really natural to search the web on it
iPod is really good too its like having your iTunes library on your computer and being able to go through all of your songs and have it all spread out where you can see it all
I bought Legendary Blade II also for a few bucks and it really shows off how great the iPads graphics are

Screen:
Like I said above the graphics are really really good on it. My old iPod apps have all had to be updated because they are not even close to the quality that the iPad demands to look good. I think that the best way to see how good the graphics are is with books. the quality of writing is better than on my laptop.
The touchscreen interface is the best that I have seen on any of the gadgets ive played with. Apple has dominated the touchcreen market and I don't think anyone comes close to them.

Smart Cover:
I don't know what it will do over the long run but so far it is great! I didn't buy it from amazon so i don't know what the legitimacy of the seller is, but as for the smart cover itself, I love it. the auto on auto off works great and so does the auto align. It looks great on the iPad 2 and it adds practically no thickness whatsoever. I feel like it actually does protect the iPad and it does its job. when it is rolled up and used as a stand it feels sturdy in both positions. I couldn't be more happy with it. clearly it doesnt protect the back from scratches and stuff, but the back is solid aluminum. aside from a few scratches, its not going to hurt it. I don't plan to drop my iPad, but i feel like if i did drop it face down its strong and cushioned enough that it wouldnt destroy my screen either. I would definitely buy it again

Memory:
I got the 16 gig and it has more than enough for my 600 songs a 125 apps.

I would totally recommend this to anyone and if anything changes I will update
That is all I have but if you found it helpful I would really appreciate you taking a few seconds to hit the helpful button :) Thanks"	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	This is just one of the most amazing products ever.  I have worked both for Compaq and Dell for over 20 years and can remember a time when Apple was on its deathbed...and that wasn't even too long ago!  I can't believe that this little tablet can do everything that I need...and do it for 10 hours!  The only con that I can knock it on is its inability (Apple locked down) to run Flash.  Very nice product Apple.  You have made a believer out of this PC guy!	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"THE IPAD 3 [...]

IPAD 2 [This is by no means a comprehensive review like some of the award winning ones which have already said it all... here's my 2cents.]

Unlike the many early adopters whom I typically identify myself with, this time I held out and waited ... for the iPad 2.  Through gritted teeth whilst my friends enjoyed the cute novelty of the first release, I sweated out the wait for the version with the itty bitty webcameras and it was well worth the wait.  What is the point if you can't skype or facetime?

An iPad is simply handicapped without a webcam, well, Apple made up for it with a vengence by having TWO in version 2! One at the back one at the front to toggle between.  Making self-photography a breeze to compose and shoot with minimal error.  FaceTime, the apple version of skype now comes bundled to facilitate easy ""skype-ing"" between iPad owners (akin to free video calls on the back of a wifi network).  This is video networking made accessible to the masses.

This also becomes your camera and video camera for web publishing - the resolution though not the highest is laudable. And the pixel warehouse for your digital camera to download to when one is travelling.

Like the iPhone, the iPad further usurps the position of the iPod relegating it further into the abyss of obsolescence - by incorporating a digital iPod inside for portable music & video storage and playback. It is not hard to allow one's life to revolve around this little tablet which makes it both a great productivity & recreational tool. Akin the hp's iPaq in 2004 except much more versatile graphically and with a much improved touchscreen.

The plethora of apps available at the Apple appStore is like a digital candy store (hundreds of thousands). So much to sample so much to buy.  Brilliant marketing to make it so cheaply available.  The volume drive works beautifully during this post GFC era where excesses are a little less rampant and frugality rules the day. 0.99 cents for a shot of adrenalin or seretonin secretion is not an unattractive proposition.

Goodbye to clutter as subscriptions go digital.  And you get to carry your entire collection (of music, newspapers, magazines, books & photographs) with you wherever you go, all contained within less than 595g of hip and style.

However security issues are not yet airtight hence I would hesitate to use this for personal banking or other such uses

A Happy Camper =)

ps...musicians can now digitally purchase musicsheets and store, transport them in this compact little marvel - reducing clutter, making the entire repertoire portable and easily accompany you everywhere, to practice, to recitals, etc. The only downside perhaps is you get one page at a time instead of the usual 2 page spread."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Received the Apple iPad2 in excellent shape and within the time frame expected. The iPad2 worked out of the box and is easy to use.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I initially didn't upgrade my iPad 1 to the 2nd generation as it was ""good enough"" for my needs. But as time went by and iOS5 was released I found my iPad 1 a bit lacking... Safari would often crash and more recent games such as Infinite Blade (the first one) wouldn't even load without crashing. It was becoming that I was getting a bit miffed with my iPad so I sold it off recently to wait for the iPad 3. Without an iPad in my life there was a bit of a void and I took advantage of one of the many resllers of the iPad 2 in the Marketplace. I found a great deal for a perfectly mint condition iPad and I have to say I am loving my iPad 2. No more crashing, the iPad 2 is really FAST and I feel it will be a bit more ""future proof"" for next year's iOS6 and even iOS7.

Though it doesn't have the rumored retina display of the iPad 3 I feel that if you can get an iPad 2 for less than retail price right now it is well worth the purchase, even this close to the release of the next incarnation. Not to mention that a retina display for a device this large is less important than on an iPhone where the image size is much smaller. The only thing a Retina display will improve is the reading of ebooks and honestly not by that much. It's not as if it goes from illegible to crystal clear, just slightly more crisp... and for my needs not as necessary since I don't read much on my iPad to begin with. Also remember higher resolution also means more battery usage... so unless they put a bigger battery in the next iPad the battery life will be impacted. If they put a larger battery then the iPad 3 itself will be larger.

Which leads to another thing I love about the iPad 2, the size! It is insanely thin compared to the first iPad and quite a bit lighter in hand. Now my left arm will have less of a work out when I'm standing and working on the iPad. :P

Mirroring with an Apple TV is beyond fun and a great feature for those of you who want a HTPC but don't want to deal with the high prices of Mac Mini or a Windows HTPC. Now I can surf the web on my TV and stream (soon to be) any video found on the internet. As Apple declared Flash video is on the down swing and soon it'll bow out of the way to h. 264 as the go to streaming media format.

The iPad 3 will no doubt be great... and I'm sure I will upgrade to it too... NEXT winter.

I paired my iPad with the perfect;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/KHOMO-DUAL-CASE-Grey-Polyurethane-Smart-Cover-FRONT-Hard-Rubberized-Poly-carbonate-BACK-Protector-for-Apple-iPad-2/dp/B005CI8836/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">KHOMO DUAL CASE: Grey Polyurethane Smart Cover FRONT + Hard Rubberized Poly-carbonate BACK Protector for Apple iPad 2</a>(I found one ""used-like new"" from Warehouse deals for $17.99)
Originally I had the Incase Magazine Case for my iPad which the Apple Smart Covers and this case mimics. Though there were features on the Magazine case that I will miss (3rd standing option that was between the vertical mode and the keyboard mode) this is by far the best looking feeling and quality full body protection that I have seen for any of the iPads. I loved the idea of the Smart Cover but hated the price and the fact there was no back protection. Also heard that the magnetic connectors end up scratching the iPad and falls off easily, this is not something I wanted.

Very happy with my purchase and am glad I got myself this great Xmas gift."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Can't say enough good things about this iPad 2!  Highly recommend it.  User friendly.  Loved by the whole family.  Bought two for grandchildren after enjoying mine.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Amazing device - the polish of the interface is great. It is super thin but also equally balanced in terms of weight. It is very fast and response and the smart cover is amazing as well. It is really a well made device.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The item was mostly in the condition stated  and it was shipped very quickly. I am enjoying it a lot.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I was excited to receive this IPAD2 as a gift.  It is meeting all expectations and more!  It also arrived in a timely fashion, which was appreciated.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The White Apple IPAD 2 was just like new as promised and shipped in a safe, secure and well protected quality manner	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Had a hard time justifing getting a iPad, but I love it.  Not a bit of buyers remorse.  Does everything that I used my notebook for plus a nive ereader.  Might not be good in direct sunlight but I don't usually read outside.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"This product fits pretty much everybody. Here is how iPad 2-s are used in my family:

my 3 years old niece : photos, games
my another 9 years old niece  : photos, games, facebook
33 years old sister (a school teacher) : emails, reading books
my 60 years old mother (retired) : emails, skype, photos, games
my 86 years old grandmother (retired) : skype"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This was my first Apple purchase.  I wasn't quite certain what I would use it for, I just knew that I wanted one.  Absurd to spend $500?  No way.  I love it!  I start my day and end my day with my ipad in my hand.  Anything you want to do - they have an app for that.  I love the instant on, 10 hour battery, and the portability.  The US Today App is my favorite news source.  Weather plus keeps me completely ready for whatever weather is coming my way. Flixter keeps me informed about upcoming movies and DVD releases.  Realtor.com is helping me find my dream house.  Do I need it? No.  Do I love it?  YES!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I found the price I was looking for at Amazon as usual. The iPad was the perfect Gift and my wife was extremely happy. Trying to keep it a secret was something as some of the small items that went with the iPad2 arrived early and I had to hide them all over the house! The iPad2 came very well packed and was protected very well. As always Amazon comes through with timely delivery and great packing to protect your purchase. I always look to Amazon first when I am looking for the right gift.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I purchased my iPad the week before Thanksgiving and was very pleased with the shipping.  I got it two days before the expected delivery. I liked the fact that Amazon has a store card too. This helped me make the decision to purchase on Amazon. I am very happy with my iPad. I got the 64G with Wifi and 3G.  Love it!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	the I-pad was as advertised, and shipped in a timely way. the wi-fi feature has proved to be a great feature. I was not able to tell this unit from a new unit..	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Ma Hon got this for me as an early birthday gift, or maybe it was just a ""Welcome Home"" gift, kind of hard to distinguish now a days.

It being the 3rd Touch Apple Product that I am carrying, the IPhone 3GS and IPhone 4s (an other gift MA Hon Had for me when I got back this time).

In capacity, it may not be the top Model, but it serves my purpose greatly. As for connectivity, it is only WiFi, so it can have its limitations as far as access to online informations are concerned, but with the IPhones handy, it is kind of OK.

What makes it different from the Iphones and the ITouch is primarily the display size, which on many occasions are far more feasible than the smaller units. There is just so many things that are much better on a bigger screen than it be on the smaller units, net browsing and entertainment, not to mention the Medical Programs that are available in the iTunes store. And that is an other plus for the unit, all being the same brand, they are all synchronized and maintained through a single account, which makes the control of context so much easier compared to having different brands units, organized with different environments and operating systems.

As for the connectivity issue, it being only WiFi, I have a HUB that allows me to connect 5 wifi units on one 3G network, and thou I must admit I have not used it that often yet, but it has it's benefits.

12/26/2011: just had to add this small remark to my review. I have been in Dubai for the last 3 days, and with my this iPad, I have been able to keep in constant contact with my Hon, via SMS text and voice/video (via FaceTime) ... That being despite it is only a WiFi unit. I have to say, that is rather marvellous ....

For the unit, for maintain, a Screen protector is highly recommended. Given the fact that it is a touch screen, even if the protector gets scratched up, you can just replace that instead of having to replace the screen itself. Also, a hard case is recommended, in my case, MA Hon got me a book case, which fold and serves as a stand as well. As for a stylus, a Soft Rubber unit is the best, I have a belkin, but I am sure you be able to find some less expensive ones that serves the purpose just as well.

I have had the unit for 10 days now, and have yet to explore MANY options available, but given the fact that I have been using the Apple's units for years now, it is all coming easy. But I can highly recommend it. Surely the Apple products are a bit pricy compared to some of the competing units, but for my needs, the compatibility and access that it offers with the other units that I possess, it is worth the couple of extra bucks. Not to mention the fact that the Apple units are some of the most beautiful and state of the art units that are available on the market, and the drawback of shortage of available softwares.... Well with the ITunes, that is a thing in the past.."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	i have an iPad 2 , i use it lots of times! it makes me feel special to have it, i got many games on it, i share and play with my friends and family ,it is so thin that i ant travel with it .	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	If you are looking mobility? This is it. It is a great tool for gathering information, emails, writing memos. Anything mobile, this is by far the greatest tool I've ever bought.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I will not get into a review of the product I purchased since this is readily available all over the Internet. I will, however, review the business which was very good. The product was received within the timeframe selected. It was sealed and very well protected during shipment. As a result I would easily recommend anyone to purchase this product. You won't be disappointed.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	My husband and I were debating on whether to buy a new laptop or an IPad.  We are happy we decided to go with the IPad--it is easily transported--works everywhere we go with 3G or Wi-Fi--and can actually fit in my purse when not in use.  The decision to purchase the IPad instead of the laptop was a good one.  I highly recommend the IPad but only with both Wi-Fi and 3G for the most flexibility.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Product received, iPad is an iPad, nothing special.
Landon Electronics where I've purchased the iPad from
was SUPERB in customer service, communication, as well
as flexible working terms.  Have dealt with Corey
from Landon Electronics couple more times after this
transaction~~all been A++, completely trustworthy!
Thanks COREY!

B0013FRNKG	I bought this for my grown daughter for Christmas.  It arrived with the plastic on it so I am expecting it to be brand new and hope it will work perfectly.  I know she will love it on December 25th. I expect it to be the real ipad 2 and not a fake.  Looks good on the outside.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	i am always worried when i purchase from a site outside Amazon, especially when the purchase is hundreds.  i took a risk to save some $$.  the ipad came in a week.  it was in a sealed box, everything on the outside in the description was as ordered.  i do not believe this was previously opened.  the device works as expected.  yes i understand it will make way for a newer model in a few months, but the value so far has been fine.  if you are worried, you need to check the return policies.  i would buy this again, especially for commodity items.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	After comparing the iPad with several other similar tablets, found this to be just what I wanted for my wife.  She wasn't sure she wanted it, but using it a few days, she nows thanks me every day.  What a big hit with her.  No problems and would recommend the iPad for everyone.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"All I can say about the iPad 2 is that it is simply amazing. The faster 1 ghz dual core A5 processor is a workhorse. The display is very high quality and is very easy on the eyes. Watching movies and surfing the web over WiFi is a joy, especially compared to the iPhone 4 which I have and love, but the limited browsing capabilities of the iPhone is enough to make you want for something larger. For iPhone users, the interface is familiar and easy to adapt to, and for new users, it is easy to learn. The iPod and Videos features are nice to have when travelling, and for those who like to read, the iBooks app is a capable book reader and there are thousands of ePub books and PDF files out there to load up on. For people that use Office to write letters and school papers, there is the iLife office suite which is Office compatible in most cases.

There is a bonus for musicians. The iPad is becoming a professional tool for musicians with a plethora of music utilities, software synths (including a few Moog products), guitar amp simulators and even Garage Band to write and record on the go. The only thing is I wish it were more of an open platform and I wish it had stereo speakers, although most times I listen with earbuds.

If you are thinking of the Kindle Fire or an Android tablet, the only advice I can give is DON'T ... The iPad 2 is a great tablet, and is constantly growing to meet the needs of all different types of users."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"excellent service and prompt.
easy to deal with and great follow-through.
competitive price, but much simpler ordering
and tracking data."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Bought this for my wife as an anniversary gift and she loves it. I think I spend more time on it than she does. Just doesnt do Flash...boo....its ok cause i don't care. i love this thing. my wife loves this thing. i don't care if Apple is evil terrible people out for our souls, i will still buy these products....just gotta save up for a few pay checks to buy it. and don't be an IDIOT and try get this or one of apples products on launch day or weekend. seriously you can wait a few weeks to upgrade i mean cmon.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	this unit almost eliminates a computer, the apps available make it fun to use. easier than carrying a laptop and more fun.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I really like my iPad. It's really good. Not much else to say. Yep, I love my iPad. Better than any other tablet.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I absolutely love the Ipad 2 and am glad I decided to purchase it.  It is a little more expensive, but it is worth it.
No problems with shipping and everything arrived well packaged. Would recommend and would use this seller again."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Adorei comprar pelo Amazon.com. Super rpido e o preo muito bom. Fcil e gil.
Entrega no prazo esperado com todo o conforto de no precisar sair de casa."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Had been hesitant to purchase an iPad for all these years possibly because I already own an iPhone, and during that time the iPad didn't have enough significant improvement over the iPhone except for the obvious size difference.  But with the newly redesigned exterior, upgraded hardware, and my wife desperately wanting one more than I did, I finally ended up getting one.  So far we are tremendously satisfy and uses it more often than we ever thought we would.

The new iPad 2 is slimmer, sleeker, faster, and lighter than it's predecessor while retaining the same display size.  Upgraded with a faster processor, it runs a lot smoother and able to multitask more quickly without getting overheated or apps crashing.  The traditional aluminum back casing makes its return with a sexy sleek taper design.  I always feel the sense of durability and toughness, just an overall very solid constructed piece of work whenever I'm handling it, even when dropped, multiple times.  Both higher megapixel cameras front and back allowing better quality photos, video, and greater facetime moments with family and friends.  These are just the major improvements over the original that I feel is already worth it's purchase.

I've tried several different tablets and non is as user friendly and simple to navigate as the iPad 2.  Once you've experience the iPad 2, you will understand why so many people go coco for it.  You won't regret it."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	i love it so much. it is an amazing product. it is Small size and swish at the same time works very excellent. also my friends like it.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Product received early and in excellent shape.. certainly exceeded my expectations. The iPad is great and exactly as perscribed. Thank you.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Ive had my Ipad2 for 3 weeks now and found that i cant put it down. I aldready have the Iphone 4 and the Ipod touch 16 gig model. What i love about apple is the inner connectivity between all 3 products. Icloud hasn't been a disappointment and love all the great apps. Its very customizable to fit all your needs and has really improved my daily living. though id like to have gotten the higher storage model for the storage but the price is very high. The cameras are great and takes great pictures. resolution for gaming is great and video chat has worked well with staying in contact with family and friends. the Ipad is a great size and very convienant to carry. i used to carry a large laptop everywhere. it was very heavy and alot to set up. This has made life alot easier and travel alot more plesant. Ive been very happy with apple products and look forward to the future and thier new systems	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"After five months of using a 16GB iPad 2 WiFi (no 3G), I can honestly say that it is one of the most useful technology purchases I can think of. While its price may be a little expensive I defiantly think it's worth every penny.
Part of the reason the iPad  is perfect for travel is that you can use it in any position, unlike a laptop, where you have to find a seat
 It won't ever got hot or overheat. Personally, I've had a couple laptops expire on me due to overheating. You always have to keep them on a firm surface so you don't block the vents. The iPad doesn't have these problems. You no longer have to grab a tray or giant book to set your laptop on when using it in bed.
Video Skype works great on this tablet - the cameras make showing people things FAR simpler due to the front and back placement.
The battery life is excellent! This thing can go for two days without a recharge! And that's with fairly heavy usage (try that with a laptop!)
The touchscreen is extremely responsive, the machine is very fast - wifi works extremely well.
The only issue I have is the reflective screen - I am not a fan of the reflective screen and have ordered a matte screen protector - not because I feel it needs protecting, but because I want to be able to read in various lighting conditions."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Researched for many hours to find the right combination of quality and price.  This item fit both requirements!  In fantastic used condition and I've spent many hours on it already.  All my accessories are also purchased through Amazon.  Love this site!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I was not sure if I'm gonna get a black or white but I'm very glad I got the white cuz it's really coooool!!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	LOVE IT! and I just bought a skin from [...]!!! BEST quality wraps I've tried. Found out they use 3M and not the cheap chinese vinyls. They even guarantee a no bubble application.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"What can I say?  It's an iPad 2!  They are great!  Install iTunes 10.5 and plug it in to sync so that it prompts you to upgrade your OS to iOS 5, it's worth it!  iOS 5 has lots of new features.

Get yourself a case for it!  Amazon has tons of cases listed!!  It's worth protecting your investment!"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Apple iPad 2....what more can you say! Excellent! It is above and beyond what I had expected! Can't put it down...always something to do!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"The iPad 2 is :
Thin.  Light
Fast (when you get it).  No flash(player :(
Jailbreakable (iOS 4.3.3) BUT: Frash soft ware should be coming out
Has full hd
Includes 2 cameras.  Incredible

I highly recommend  getting a key board if your going to use the Internet.

You can find tons of apps that only work on iPad 2

#1 (kindle is #2)"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I don't know why I waited so long to purchase this....it's awesome!!! It was super easy to set up and it auto synced with my iTouch on iTunes account to transfer all of my files directly to this new device. My toddler son LOVES the age appropriate apps and it was really simple and easy for the entire family to use and enjoy right away. I can't wait to get all my apps and settings the way I prefer and start enjoying all of its' capabilities.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Excelente producto, hice mi compra desde Venezuela y el aparato llego a tiempo y en perfecto estado, altamente recomendado el vendedor.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I have been a Windows gal since the 1980s. I've owned many PCs and one laptop during that time and never even considered getting anything other than Windows. When I got a phone I made sure it ran Android. I was anti-Apple. I thought people who bought Apple products were members of a cult who'd been brainwashed.

Hmm. I got an iPad after my partner said she wanted one. I was seduced the second I held it. Wow. Unbelievable. It took minutes to set up. There were no error messages. Everything worked perfectly. The design is elegant, sublime.

I never thought I'd own a tablet let alone an Apple product, but I can honestly say this was one of the smartest, coolest purchases I've ever made. The apps are great, the battery holds a charge, and it's an incredibly freaking fun toy.

I was wrong. All you Apple people were right. I am now a member of the cult and will probably only buy Apple products in the future."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	We have both the original and the iPad 2, and love them both.  The 2 is lighter and more powerful and the smart cover is a clever feature.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Muy bueno, como la mayoria de los productos Apple. El tamao y peso ideales, full hd y muy buenas aplicaciones.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I haven't used any tablets other than Apples' product. Original iPad was my first one, which was bought as a gift for my friend and accidentally became a good entertainment for me and my wife. It's a great product, one of a very few gadgets I find myself truly love to use and feel the convenience and ease of use that rarely comes with a product that is sophisticated in its functionality and simple in its design. The reason I talk about my iPad in a iPad 2 review is that I want to give you a perspective of how I loved my iPad and all the good things about iPad has been improved and perfected, either in a subtle or substantive way, in iPad 2. The most obvious change I sensed were two things, a significant reduce in weight and a increase in processing speed. I have frequently found myself looking for iPad 2 at home to have a google search job done even though iPad is up front of my eyes.

Another thing I came to appreciate both iPad and iPad 2 is their intuitive user interface. Quite opposite to a technology geek as I am, my mom has no knowledge in what an operating system is and has no idea how her order is fulfilled by a computing device, be it a pc or whatever else. This makes it very hard to explain to her how she should interact with the interface of an operating system. To her, opening up an application on a Windows desktop, in the start menu and Notification area are fundamentally different actions that take conceptually distinctive approaches to accomplish. Such understanding and confusion in opening different application have soon disappeared after only a few practices with the iPad home button. And now she is happily occupied herself with the Bakery Story app on a device easiest ever to use."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I love this product and all of the apps. I can write and keep track of contracts, hours I work on the job and so much more. I am a photographer, graphic designer, and web designer. So I stay very busy with contracts writing invoices and so much more. I can keep track of all of this with the i pad.
Sense I have all apple products including 27 inch i mac and 17 inch macbook pro they all stay together using icloud you just can not go wrong with this device

B0013FRNKG	Got this as early Xmas present! I was surprise to get it, since I used my iphone so much.. and its getting smaller to read off the iphone, the iPad just does the job for me! Thank you... but now I have to spend less time with the family :-)	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This is my most favorite thing that i have. I was thinking about it and finely got it. I am happy what i can to with it and i only got th wifi and thoght about it and i didn't need something with 3g.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I got my iPad as a gift from my wife and daughter this past weekend. Since I got it Saturday I have not put it down! It is amazing! I love it. It was very easy to set up and begin using it.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The ipad2 is awesome, fast, nice camera. only down side is that there's currently no jailbreak available for this model. unless it's the earliest firmware.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I bought a Samsung Galaxy Tablet a while ago, and it sucked Horribly.  Going from that to the Ipad 2 its an astounding difference. Ipad 2 is very fast, very clean program. It may take you a minute to get used to the programing if you're like me and have used a PC majority of your life. I Highly recommend this product to anyone who is wanting to get a tablet. Please don't go with the Samsung Galaxy Tablet because you'll just regret it, and wind up returning it to get the Ipad 2.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"No quality problems, works very well and love it! Everyone knows iPad so I did need to said what that is. The ID fit the apple' ID.
Just a little pity because it have an ios5.0.1 in it,Waiting for ios5 jealbreak."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"The ipad 2 has really changed the way I stay close to information both personally and professionally.  With a wide range of available applications from the App Store and also through my company, I have everything I need to stay productive.  Because I also got the 3G model, it works whereever I go in the United States.

Hardware: The screen is bright and a joy to look at.  Multitouch works very well and instantaneously fast.  There is no lag at all in moving across apps. The battery lasts all day long and worked well on 10 hour international flights.

Software: iOS 5 is a joy to use and gives me all the flexibility that I want. I wish you could use it as a wifi hotspot but maybe they'll allow that one day."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I received my iPad 2 from Worldwide within a week of ordering it. I am very pleased with my order.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"What makes Apple a great company is the amount of polish they put on their finished devices that ensure they work and work well. Bugs and other device problems aren't something you come to expect from Apple because of the tireless work that goes into making sure the manufactured parts work together in harmony. This was something manufacturers of other tablets did not do when they rushed their way to the market Apple was claiming all to itself. The result was a number of products, most of which had bugs or other serious performance problems.

Anyway, the iPad 2 bulked up a bit from its predecessor. A dual core processor and a little more RAM helped keep this device up with the Johnsons, spec-wise. Usability-wise, it's still as friendly to the user as can be. The interface isn't complicated and anyone familiar with how an iPhone works will have no problem getting into this device right away.

Cameras on front and back were added. It's a shame they couldn't get a HD camera sensor in the device because that would make Facetime all the better. As it is, the video quality isn't that great but it does what it says it does and the video chat function works pretty nice. The back camera? Never used it and don't plan to.

Then there is the App Store itself. Instead of paying $69.99 every time you need to feed your kid's hunger for a new game, you can drop 99 cents for most applications, whether they are games or educational apps or any of the vast amount of programs created that fit anyone's budget. As tablets become more and more popular, more and more content is finding its way onto the device. ABC has a player where you can watch their new shows in their entirety. HBO has one, too. Doctors are using these devices as they make patient records easily available. Teachers use these to track grades for their classes and educational apps help them figure out what subject matter their students may be struggling with. And these are just two niche examples of what the device can do. As an everyday consumer, you can really shape this device around your life and even find applications that make your professional life easier.

For a portable, in your bed experience, this works wonders. The backlight trims when it detects low lighting so your eyes won't strain. The 10 inch screen is more than enough for watching Netflix or other content you can stream (I use AirVideo since I have a lot of media on my home machine and it streams it all -- .AVI, .MKV, .MP4 -- perfectly).

If you take this wifi model out of the house and find yourself in places where you don't have wifi access, you can still use whatever apps you have that don't require an Internet connection, or you can play videos that you store on the device. Since this is Apple we're talking about, you can find apps that will play any kind of media so you aren't stuck with just the .MP4 codec that Apple would prefer you use.

There aren't many limitations to the device...Adobe Flash support is usually cited among the things people don't like about the device. Good news on that front: Adobe is abandoning Flash for mobile devices (in part because they can't fix the non-stop security holes Flash has) so eventually that won't be a concern. Steve Jobs said Adobe Flash was garbage and didn't get support for it with the iPad. Other manufacturers chose to include Flash but it didn't take long before they admitted it killed the battery life on their devices, while the iPad2 can go all day without needing a charge. Watch movies all day. Play games all day. You don't need this hooked up to a power outlet all the time like you would a laptop and this is much easier to carry around, so the number of situations you can use this device (waiting rooms, long car trips, air travel) goes way up.

There are many things to like about this device and there are some drawbacks (no USB support besides tethering to your computer, no HDMI, no Adobe Flash and no expanded memory card slots. But they are few and nearly insignificant when you realize there are alternatives to the roadblocks you think you may face, including cloud storage.

This tablet is the cream of the crop. There is some good competition out there but the ease-of-use, availability of 70,000 plus apps in the Apple app store, plus how dependable the device is keeps Apple on the throne of best tablet manufacturer."	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"The iPad 2 is great!  With iCloud everything syncs perfectly with my iPhone.  Really happy with it!  It is nice to have the same functionality of the iPhone with a much more manageable screen size.  Highly recommended product.  Just not from the vendor I purchased it from.....""stuyvesant camera"" was difficult to deal with and the first one arrived broken, communication from them was poor and they went back on their word.  Now that I have an intact iPad I'm very happy but will never purchase anything from them again."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"As everyone expects, the IPad 2 is almost flawless.  It is a wonderful piece of technology that pays off if you don't expect it to be a replacement  for a pc.

And as usual, Amazon was great to deal with. :-)"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I purchased the iPad 2 and was pleased with all the features it can offer. I am able to surf the web on Safara, play a plethora of games from the massive app store selection, check my stocks, and many many more. I now find watching videos on it a big plus as well. Compared to the new Kindle Fire, I have to say the iPad 2 is still much faster with its A5 processor and much better looking. I highly recommend this product as it leads the family of tablet technologies. Overall, a popular and renowned product. 5 stars!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Worthed buying Apple newest ipad using Amazon... freed up my time knowing that the service would achieve my espectations as usual.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Not gonna lie, when I saw a refurbished iPad from a non apple source, I thought there may be some issues. At the same time I figured I could always return it so I went forward and made the purchase.
It arrived a few days later in perfect condition, with no scratches or dents. I couldn't tell the refurbished from the new, and I'm very picky.

Thank you so much. I saved over 160 going with you guys!!!!"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The ipad 2 is brand new as described and very good. I like it very much and consdering purchasing Macbook air in the future~	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Love this device. Presentations to my clients, prospects and internal resources has been received with great paise. 90% of computer tasks are now complete and delivered from the iPad. Besides the awesome business task, it has made a great entertainment option for the family while traveling and I use the kindle ap to read as well. The most versatile technology device on the market.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"My husband and I love our IPads!
First I purchased a 16G, but used up most of the space with books, music and pictures.  So my husband got that one and I purchased a 64G (model 1). Love it.  Then I was fortunate to have another loaned to me as part of a Board of Directors (it sounds like an expensive prop, but considering the copying, etc., storing of paperwork, and all else that goes into a Directorship, this is a real bargain!).
Then we continued to have issues with our ISP, and would go days w/o internet service, so I felt it was necessary to move up to an IPad 2 with Verizon.
I just couldn't be happier!"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This has been a wonderful new toy for the family.  Many incredible functions, and beautiful screen highlight this machine.  There are plenty of free apps available through Apple that allow fill any need without spending any money.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Cannot complain, this product is AWESOME all around!

Although I have not tested any other tablet, I am currently happy with my purchase."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Best tablets that are period. These are the easiest to maneuver and use. Love this item. Apple has the best products.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Great product ! Didn't think I needed a tablet, but now I can't go anywhere without it. Takes a little time to get used to but very simple to operate. Great apps for almost anything. Graphics are great too.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I bought the iPad 2 for a specific program to keep my charts for flying. The iPad 2 is great, easy to use and very affordable for all that it can do.  I am using it more all the time. My purchase and delivery were flawless.  I chose the iPad 2 with 32g because the extra 100 dollars for more storage was a cheap insurance for added space and if you don't get 3G it does not have built in gps which is very handy with the map app.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	When coupled with Bluetooth keyboard more than efficient enough for web surfing basic word processing etc.  Definitely recommend to anyone who craves portability	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This will be super short... After comparing the others out there... iPad wins hands down.  So, if you are looking for the best, have the money, buy this tablet.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	GOOD EXPERIENCE, It's easy to use it and I have a lot of fun. I think It's one of the best things I have.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The basic iPad gives me:  (1) a book/magazine reader (2) an iPod  (3) a very convenient camera and video camera  (4) web browsing  (5)  E-mail  (6)  A virtually limitless number of apps that I can download  (7) Very simple and intuitive navigation  (8)  Pretty good sound  (9)  Crisp display.  I've owned iPods and now the iPad for about 6 months.  I haven't had the slightest problem w/ either.  Amazing devices.  Would I pay $499 for an iPad or $199 for a Kindle Fire?  You're right, I'd pay the extra for the real McCoy.  The utility to me of the iPad and all of the apps that I have is far greater than $499.  Wouldn't do w/o it.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I was a little hesitant to spend this much however I really enjoy the product. I already have an Iphone yet having a much larger screen is very useful.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Everyone knows ipad is king. This device is great and will become an important part of your life. Only complaints:
Apple tries to control everything you do and everything costs money.
Corners should have been better supported so glass does not crack so easily
Smart cover does not protect against much.

It is great. I barely use my mac pro anymore and do 80% of my work on the ipad. There are still somethings that are a pain on a tablet though."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I had been thinking for months on which type of ""Tablet"" I should buy. Hitting up every link I could to review tablets. As a windows system administrator, I needed something to carry with me so that I could have my technical books handy. The nook,kindle were just not right for me, The Kindle reader, is good as a reader goes, but there is not internet access on the kindle reader I have. Sure it has whisper net, but no ""Surfing capabilities that I am aware of. The IPad 2 solved all that. Just a small learning curve,(a couple of hours)and I was  off and running. Have it now for about 4 days, I am not sorry I chose this version of tablet. Also what was a little icing on the cake, I had ordered it normal shipping, I think 3-5 days, I got email form the merchant, (Penguin2012) saying Hey we are really happy that you chose us as the merchant. to show our appreciation, they shipped it next day shipping. I thought that was really kool.
Anyway, happy with the complete purchase. Thanks all involved."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I thought about getting a tablet a hundred and seventy  eight times before finally buying one. I have a couple of laptops and a mac desktop so I wondered if I really need one. I know it isn't that expensive to own but then I also had 2 iPod Touches. So basically I was going to get the iPad 1 first but then they came out with the iPad 2, I waited several months and then like any man who hates indecision I decided to get a tablet. The choice was simple. I was used to the iPod Touch (4th generation) and thought this would possibly be similar. I was worried it would sit in one corner of my house. To clarify I never needed an iPad, what I did like however the most was the speaker on it. You see, i'm big on music and wanted something that can behave like a traveling jukebox. Besides watching a film when I'm on an airplane  won't be a bad idea either. I was sincerely considering getting the Samsung Galaxy 10.1 but then I knew this thing has been the best selling product of all time so I decided to get it anyway. I've had it for a little over a month now and in the following points i shall speak of the features, some unique and share my findings with you.

UNIQUE FEATURES OF THE IPAD 2 -

1. At 9.7 inches of diagonal length and brightness that is nothing short of being called exquisite one would imagine this thing to have an average battery or a good battery but the battery life is extraordinary. I use my iPad for a couple of hours daily and I must say that despite music playback, wireless data transferring to the iPad from my mac iTunes library, this thing lasts me for at least 5 days. This is remarkable. I can give you the best device in the world as a manufacturer but if the battery life isn't good what good is it to keep charging it. It does take a very long time to charge mind you which tells you that it's gonna last you a while. For some bizarre reason I like to charge this with my Mac. Charging using the wall outlet is slowly getting primitive.

2. The speaker is amazing, it's loud and clear but you have to know where the speakers are placed and it's very important or else it will hamper your experience. Sometimes you have to hold it in your hands to make sure the sound output is ideal. Does it work well placing it on  a flat surface glass or  wood? Yes. What do I use the speaker for? iPod. At 16GB this is just about enough for me to carry a contemporary selection of music  and films with me. Does it sound good while browsing internet pages? Yes. Youtube is exhilarating to say the least. Also only selected Facebook videos will work because many are not available on mobile devices so if something doesn't run on your iPhone or android phone, it may not run on the iPad. Fair trade.

3. There are two cameras, both are sub par for 2011 but if you're sitting in a dimly lit room and have washed your face, it may just somehow take a nice photo of you but I seldom take pictures from it. I like to record 30 second to 1 minute videos and email it directly to people. I always keep it connected with my wifi. This is really convenient and is a NEW WAY for me to keep in touch. I never did this with my mac or my iPhone. Also please note an interesting thing here, if your video is too long, your iPad tells you that you cannot send it owing to the large size. I have not gotten into the whole editing video and cutting it thing so what I then resort to is UPLOADING  IT DIRECTLY ON YOUTUBE. Great feature though quality is to be compromised slightly.

4. The iPad 2 weighs less than the iPad 1 by a significant amount. This shall be reason enough for people to upgrade or maybe you guys can wait for the iPad 3 to come out in April next year (random estimate)

5. While typing on the iPad is a breeze for ""novices"" and ""intermediates"" it is not ideal for a super fast expert typer. Having said that I don't use it much for typing. I am much faster on my phone than I am on the iPad. I have noticed i am able to type best when I am not holding the tablet in my hands and it is resting on a surface. Now I have installed a invisible shield for it because it liked to keep a daily account of fingerprints. Did I find an ideal one? No. I also use an invisible PLASTIGLASS thing for the back which I found on Amazon and found super amazing. The back is so smooth even with this accessory. I find the leather cases a little too pricey and there are several available but I find them kind of obstructing to the design of this iPad and a little cheap so I don't use.

6. Great company on an airplane - While I am always fidgeting with this device when it's playing something, the device makes for great company on an airplane provided you have an ""mp4"" type file to play back on it. You can easily install it using iTunes. But if you have  an avi file or a divx file I don't know how to play them or transfer them. The iPad doesn't work as a USB STORAGE device so it won't show up on your finder (or my computer) when connected. There is no way for a user to save files by dragging and dropping. WHILE MANY ARGUE over the relevance of such storage, I believe the absence of it helps in keeping things organized and we all could do with a little less clutter. iTunes works beautifully for transferring stuff. I have noticed on all apple platforms (iPhone, iPod, iPad) that uploading a picture to Facebook involves more steps than on Android. Infact in certain cases Apple makes you buy an application to upload files to Facebook for the iPad. I find this cheek quite amusing but I take it with a pinch of humor. While playing back video you can tilt the device in any which way you want and the screen tilts that way. The video output is superior and the tilt  helps so it makes sure your fingers don't keep smacking into the headset jack when headphones are attached.

7. Browsing - Yahoo looks utterly brilliant on the iPad. I love to go  once a day and simply look at their news features. Most search engines have specific websites for the tablets to access em and it looks super. My friend has a Xoom and he loves his tablet and is always talking about it but I see a sincere longing in him for an Apple iPad. The interface is unmatchable whether you are browsing, playing back a video or a song, the iPad wins. I do not use this as a task keeper so I don't bother with office utilities and all. Neither do I edit videos on the iPad but I believe there are inexpensive  solutions available. I read about them all the time on Macworld. Browsing on the internet, watching youtube videos, being on Facebook - it all seems flawless on the iPad. Much better than using a computer or an iPod or a phone. This is where the iPad truly shines. The font and the brightness I repeat is flawless and magical - nothing like i have seen in a dozen years of computers.

8. TRANSFER - With the new ios 5.00  and iCloud I can actually send music, video, pictures to the iPad or play them back on my mac without connecting. Another big significant improvement. Now if only I could charge it wirelessly :)

9. Are you thinking about getting the 32gb version? Don't. The 16gb is just fine  - for applications you won't need more. Multi-tasking is very easy and truly mastered on the iPad as opposed to the relevance on an iPod or iPhone courtesy of the big screen. Yes there is no flash support so I can't watch imdb trailers directly on the iPad. I have found applications which allow me to download music directly for free on the iPad - I am sure you will too. Netflix works flawlessly on this. I have put 740 songs on it and three films and have 35 applications installed but I still have 3GB remaining. After watching this film once I delete it to keep it free for another. This way you won't need a bigger iPad but if you do the difference is just $100 + Tax. I have also found that there exist many solutions for iPad users to wirelessly connect the iPad with a wireless storage hard drive. The expansion options are super. So take a look into that but I strongly advise getting just the basic  16gb version. I have a 64 gb iPhone and 64gb iPod so maybe I am so adamant on the uselessness of a higher storage iPad too.

10. Miscallenous - It works with bluetooth, the iPad is light, unique for browsing, unique for youtube, ultra fast, multitasking is beautiful, you can play music or pandora while browsing, you can also switch the screen off and it will continue singing to you for several hours, the battery life does justice to it's perfections, the cameras are ok, i never Skype using it or i don't use FaceTime cause I don't know many people who do that. I like to carry it in my 13inch laptop case logic bag when I have to. I haven't dropped much water on it because i like it too much to be clumsy  with it. No headphones or instruction manual is  shipped. It took me roughly 30 minutes to set it up by connecting  with my mac.  It comes with a decent amount of charge so you can go 4 hours of playing around with it right out the box.

I want you to look at all the above mentioned points and ask yourself if this is a notebook replacement? Obviously not. Because it has no physical keyboard, hdmi out, usb slot but if you are a casual browser, you can invest in this first and use it within the first 30 days to make your mind up. Apple is good that way. Overall - this is by far the best device i have ever used. It beats my iPod, iPhone, android phone, old blackberry, my mac desktop (close  2nd) , my ASUS laptop, my tv, my xbox, my blu ray player, my cameras and even my iron. Good luck. Don't buy the white one, get the black one."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I am really amazed at ipad on what it can do with this tiny processor. Browsing the web sometimes is noticeably slow, but it is not much worse than the experience on a powerfull windows machine. Good job.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"iPad 2 is a great improvement over the original. It's not an absolute must have
if you already have the original, but if you don't, get it! The form factor fits perfect
and comfortable in the hand. With iOS 5, it really rocks. An excellent product."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"If you still on the fence on what tablet to purchase, play it safe and buy an Ipad 2.  The experience is much more enjoyable over all.  This is a non-biased review, I own a Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 as well (I may even be more of a fanboy toward Samsung, owning a 3d Blu ray player, 3D Led and LCD tv).  In my opinion, what makes the Ipad better than any of the Android tablets is the apps.  Apples app store has more apps than the Android market has to offer.  The Apple app store is also better looking and more organized (Android is getting better though).  Everything is clearly labeled for what device ie Ipad or Iphone/Itouch.  On the Android market its hard to tell whats what.  I have downloaded many apps that are intended for a phone.  I downloaded Guitar Hero 5 from the Android market and playing it was unbearable due to the tiny screen size, there was no option to enlarge the screen (Android needs to do a software update for this asap).  If you have a favorite Itouch game that you wanted to play on a bigger screen you can with the Ipad, you can increase the screen size).  In my opinion developers of apps are clearly making them first on Ipad.  For example, Netflix, Face Book, Onlive, and Boxee.  I would love to have a offical Face Book app for my Galaxy Tab. There is a Face Book app for Android but its ment for a phone and looks terrible on a tablet.  Why does it take so long for android to get them?  Even similar apps for both apple and android look better on Ipad, words with friends and Amazon Shopping app for starters!  Amazon you NEED to give Android the same app you gave Apple!  The one on my GT sucks.  Apple even has more demos of games...there usually called something like lite or free.  Apple has airplay which is cool if you own a AppleTV, I can play Angry Birds on my Samsung 3D LED 55 inch TV!  Yes Samsung has AllShare (Samsungs version of AirPlay) but for some stupid reason the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 doesnt have that app!  Why in the world does the first generation have it but the new one doesnt?  You cant even download it off the Samsung App store, maybe its coming w/Ice Cream Sandwich??  Heres basically my pros and cons for the Ipad:

Pros
Easy to use
Tons of Apps and better looking ones
Airplay
Way more accessaries and Cases (Im still waiting for a OtterBox case for my GT)

Cons
No flash
Very controlled device and you cant customize it like Android

Heres a couple of things that I like better on the Galaxy tab.  On paper the GTs specs are better than Ipad 2.  You can customize it just about any way you want...but you need to be a lil tech savy.  Just about every game on Android is free and and they are full games (with ads)  Everyday Amazon gives you a free app!
There is more than one market place to shop from (Android Market, Amazon, Samsung etc.)  Youtube looks cooler on Android...love the 3d honey comb looks!"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Estoy muy contento por esta compra realizada ya que recib mi iPad 2 sin ningn contratiempo... Recomiendo este vendedor a todos en Venezuela. El producto me llego 100% original y nuevo de paquete, Apple es lo mejor. Amazon lo mximo, por ac el iPad me sali a mitad de precio con respecto a como lo venden en mi pas!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I use this way more than I ever thought I would! Links work fast and it is super easy to use.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Arrived faster then expected!! The iPad is still brand new! Easy set up and ipad was fully charged. Rocker Jakes you guys rock!!!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I've had the Apple iPad 2 for a few weeks now and I love it. It's so much easier to bring along when traveling than a regular laptop. Most of my iPod apps work on the iPad as well, and I didn't have to purchase the apps a second time. The iPad camera's resolution is not great when zooming way in on a subject, but I didn't really expect the iPad to replace a good quality hand-held digital camera anyway. It works well with Wi-Fi; haven't yet had a need to sign up for the optional Verizon service. Overall, it's been a good purchase.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I have never owned an Apple product before.  I love my iPad and this product is compact and so easy to use!  Can't wait till my phone upgrade to get an iPhone.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I must admit I have not tested any other tablets. Nonetheless, ever since I got the iPad, I have been using it for a range of tasks, focusing mainly on reading magazines and books. I travel often, and the iPad allows have everything I might want to read on a trip in one, which also happens to be lighter and more compact than most books out there. The only drawback is that typing on this machine is slow since you have to keep an eye on the keyboard at all times, but this holds true for all other tablets, and its easily fixed by purchasing an external keyboard if typing is essential to you. A must have accessory for this item is some sort of protective case. I have two, apple's sponsored screen protector (which conveniently locks the ipad when shut), and a sleeve for traveling, so that I can easily put it in my backpack when traveling.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"This product is amazingly wonderful. No cause for regret at all. Any computer savy without ipad2 is living in the stone age.
Steve Jobs is a legend."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	extremely happy with this ipad. Bought it for my husband to dink around with and he loves it. easy to sent up and to navigate. much easier to cart around than a laptop!!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Let me start out by saying, I am neither a Apple Fanboy, nor a pro-Windows person.  I have a Windows phone paired with a Mac computer.  So, I generally buy products based on the product rather than the company. At first, I was completely against getting an iPad, since I figured that my Mac could do anything that my phone couldn't. I broke down my favorite aspects and least favorite aspects of the iPad 2 (not software, but hardware):
Favorites:
1) The weight distribution of the tablet: It doesn't seem to be too heavy, or too light (as in cheap).
2) Materials: I was leaning more toward a Android tablet, but the materials that went into those felt so cheap to me. The iPad 2 has a great aluminum feel to the back, with a glossy front.  I miss the Gorilla Glass of my Samsung phones though, since I never needed a screen protector.
3) Everything just works:  If you have ever had an Android phone, you understand what I mean. Occasionally, the Android OS just freezes, or crashes (at least on my previous phone).  When you press the home button, there is no lag.  This has more to do with the software of the iPad (iOS 5). True, it is more of a restricted OS than the Android OS, but its a sacrifice I was willing to make.
4) The prestige that comes with an iPad:  This may sound shallow, but I didn't not want to have to defend my position of getting an Android tablet over an iPad.  This holds its value long into the future, verses lesser known Android tablets.
5) Clean lines:  A minimalistic design.  Clean cut, very stylish.

Least Favorite:
1) True, the iPad is very balanced, but it does get heavy when reading after awhile.  If you are looking for an ereader and won't be going into the features of the iPad, then don't buy it.  Buy the Kindle Fire or another device.
2) Every accessory seems to be (excluding a few of course) very expensive.  If you want a good deal, you have to be willing to hunt for awhile, buy used, or pony up the extra money to buy the protective case, or screen protector, etc.
3) I still feel nervous carrying it around with me. Its a double edge sword... yes, I love the prestige that comes with the ipad, but so do the thieves.

Overall, this review isn't going to make someone who doesn't want one, buy an iPad.  What I must say is: if you have never used an iPad, don't hate on iPad owners.  After using this for awhile, I can't understand my hesitation at first to buy one, or why I waited so long.
Advice: rumors are swirling about the next iPad (claims to be iPad 3). Do your research on the rumors or wait, so that you can buy the most up to date out there."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This is a great product, faster and lighter than the first generation. I still wish it had adobe flash, but it is still amazing and it is very user friendly...amazon has the best deals for used electronics, the iPad is so new buying it used was a great deal :)	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I've had my iPad2 for 8 months now and absolutely love it. It is so much better to take to class because it hardly weighs anything. I downloaded apps for note-taking in class and I can write notes directly on my powerpoint slides (which is what most professors use in lecture). I also put some educational apps for my 2 year-old son and he loves them too.  The speed is great (no lag time opening and closing apps, safari, photos, and anything else). As of right now, I don't have any negative comments to write about it, but if I later do, I'll post a response about it.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I purchased as a birthday gift for my wife she loves it, takes it everywhere she goes. with the wi-fi and the 32 gb hard drive this has replaced her laptop!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I love this device...do not know why I did not get one sooner.  I can get mail, surf the web, play games, even play the piano!  I put my Kindle books in it as well.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Muy buen producto estoy completamente satisfecho con el equipo adquirido y con la forma como lo compr por medio de Amazon. El tiempo de entrega fue mejor que el esperado y el empaque del producto lleg en excelente condiciones.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This is a 5 Star purchase and a 5 star supplier - I made an error the unit is exactly as ordered and received on the promised date - no problems.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I'm not an Apple fan by any means of the imagination, but I have to admit that I do own quite a few of their devices.  I learned my lesson to pick and choose what I feel most comfortable using and to not be so stubborn about supporting a company that I dislike.  I should say the only thing I dislike about Apple is their computer operating system.  It's not an operating system for me.  I don't feel comfortable using it and it is definitely much more boring than using a Windows operating system that has a gazillion more software written for it.  I'm a Windows guy, grew up with Windows and dabbled with Linux.  I tried to jump on to Linux band wagon long time ago and attempted to stick to it.  It was after several years that I realized Linux was likely not going ANYWHERE on the consumer side for the foreseeable future.  Linux will always be known as a great server operating system, reliable SAMBA share server, etc, but it will never surpass Windows or OS X.  Even Mac/OS X is popular among the consumers and look what this operating system is built on top of!

  That being said, it does me no good to hate Apple just because I feel like it.  I bought their iPad 2 device and have been using it since it's initial launch (I did not buy it the first day of launch online, but definitely 3-4 days afterwards).  This device has been great since I purchased it the first day.  Yes, it does not support FLASH, but I realized this before I decided to buy the iPad.  The screen is sharp, the performance is fast and the screen touch is extremely responsive.  The battery life is really good compared to other devices (e.g. iPhone 4s, iPhone 3Gs).  It is a device for casual usage, you browse, you email, you do stuff for leisure.  I sometimes forget to connect the iPad to the charger over night, but I have not had to charge this device for 2-4 days, depending on how heavy I use it.  It's not like the iPhone where I MUST recharge it each night or else it will DEFINITELY run down the battery to critical level.  Granted, it's the WiFi version so it does not have the techno-complication of having to deal with 3G.  iPad 2 is very stable and robust.  I am definitely the type of person who would take every opportunity to criticize an Apple device, but I have to admit that I have had absolutely no problems using this iPad device.  I have no experience with any other tablet device in the market, but if you are wondering if you should get one or if this is going to be a reliable device, I can definitely say it has been super reliable in all phase it was made for since I received it.  Again, it does NOT support Flash, so be aware of this before you purchase it.  It's light weight, does a LOT of tasks that you can do from a computer and has a whole ton of apps available.

  If you want to compare it to a computer, don't try to completely compare it apples to apples (pun intended), because it still isn't as ""flexible"" as a computer.  My laptop has a built in physical keyboard and mouse, I do not have to purchase a separate keyboard or mouse like I would have to for a iPad (you have to use the virtual keyboard on the iPad).  I can truly multitask on my Windows laptop, on the iPad it's ""semi-multitask"" at most.  The iPad cannot come close to the laptop's 8GB memory, 750 GB hard drive laptop that can run VMWare, play online multi-player games, store files where-ever I want, in whatever directory I created.  There are SO many things I can do on a laptop that the iPad currently cannot do... so unless you ONLY browse, type a few emails, make a few purchases from Amazon/eBay or other available stores and maybe chat occasionally online... then don't expect this iPad to really replace a laptop or desktop (I'm typing this review via laptop as it faster to do than on an iPad).

  One negative about the iPad, but it's not Apple's fault, the Apps that people sell may be written for the iPad only or for iPhone only but sometimes written for both.  This means that if the app was designed specifically for the iPhone and you buy it... then it will not LOOK optimized for the iPad since the screen size on the iPad will make it stretched.  If you purchase the app for the iPad, then it may not even be available for the iPhone (I haven't seen an app for the iPad available for the iPhone).  Often they sell TWO different versions of the same app for both devices, so you have to pay double the amount to use them on your two devices.  Again, this review is about the iPad device, not about how the apps are developed, so overall, the iPad 2 is awesome... highly recommended for a tablet purchase."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I bought this for my wife and she loves it.  One mistake I made was not checking with a service provider before buying it.  I thought we were grandfathered for unlimited data with AT&T since that is how my iPhone is but that is not the case with the iPad.  When considering 3g don't make the same mistake I did, I would have got Verizon.  Anyway, the iPad itself seems to be a great tool for work and play and is much easier to tote than a laptop.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	What else needs to be said?  This is like holding a little bit of Steve Jobs in your hand.  I have never had anything to do with Apple products until now.  Have been a confirmed DOS/Windows/PC person all my life.  Now I realize what I've missed.  IPad2 is incredibly fast, instant loading, and easier to type on (for me) than a keyboard.  Simply can't put it down.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I bought this Ipad2 as a gift for a friend in Canada. Make sure that you specify if its going to be a gift because he had to pay a duty on it. Other than that he raves about how wonderful it is and I have one as well. We video chat on it all the time and it makes it so much easier to keep in contact with me living in Saudi arabia and him in Canada.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Cool thing, before I used just the ipod, but one is aging and your eyes need larger image. I'm very happy. I can only recommend.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I love my iPad.  It's easy to read, not too big and it goes everywhere with me.  I'm glad I bought it.  It holds a charge well also.  Once you have charged the iPad, that charge will last for more than a day or two (depending how much you read).  I plug mine in every night before bed and it's ready the next morning.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I bought this device a month ago, and so far I find no problem using it.

Honestly, I prefer the galaxy tap. I used them both. Samsung apps are better, cheaper and more plentiful.

I give it five stars because the shipping was so fast.
I love it."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I was never an apple fan, but they're devices work seamlessly together and with all the Apps out there.  Now with IOS 5, even better.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Easy to use, light weight, stylish and practical.....this iPad2 is excellent and i can't imagine traveling without it......it is not a replacement for the PC though.........but complements it nicely.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Everyone was at awe and full of excitement when the Apple iPad 2 was announced, but how does it really stand up to the competition and is it worth the upgrade? Now that it has been released for six months and I own one, along with the first generation iPad and a HP Touchpad. I feel I am one person that can give a fair review of the item. Examining how the iPad 2 is an improvement over the original on the outside, inside, and how it compares to the Touchpad in terms of hardware and software is a great way to show why the iPad 2 is worth buying.
 When first grasping the iPad 2, you notice it is much thinner than the iPad 1. It is approximately the same thickness as a simple pencil; you may ask how does it not break? Well it is construced of aluminum on the back and gorilla glass on the front. The gorilla glass in the iPad 2 is double the strength of the similar type of glass used in the first generation iPad. The testers at the website Gizmodo.com compared these two pieces of glass with two pieces of wood and bending the glass between them. The iPad 2 glass stretched twice as far before breaking.  The glass is not perfect though, it will break it dropped without a case because it is indeed glass. Unlike the iPad 1, the iPad 2 has special tiny magnets built in around the screen that allows Apple's new product the smart cover to be usable. The cover sticks to the iPad 2 and wakes up the iPad when the cover is removed. This interesting feature is a feature not available with the first iPad. The screen size and resolution is the same as the original iPad, with a 9.7"" IPS technology screen and a 1024x768 resolution. A new addition to the iPad 2 is the cameras on both the front and the back of the device. The front facing camera, similar to that of the one in the Apple iPhone 4 is mainly used for skype and video conversations. The camera on the back is a low one megapixel camera, and is quite grainy. I cannot imagine anyone having a use for this and I myself have never found a use for it. It still is better than the originals iPad's though, since it does not even have a camera.  The iPad 2 can also be bought in the color white, unlike the original. I bought my iPad 2 from Apple.com the night it was available and got it in a few days with free shipping.
The internals have gone through a drastic change between the two iPads. Apple, along with every other technology giant upgrades their devices to meet the latest technology. Apple has shown this by upgrading from the slower A4 single-core processor in the original iPad to the faster and much smoother dual-core A5 processor found in the iPad 2. The random access memory or RAM has been doubled between the two devices from 256 megabytes to 512 megabytes. The RAM upgrade allows more webpages to be open simultaneously in applications such as skyfire and safari. On the original iPad if you open ten pages at once, the device is quite slow and can even become unresponsive; on the new iPad ten pages is no problem, with no slowdowns. The speakers are the same in both iPad's, although the placement of them is a bit different. The hard drive storage options are the same in both devices, depending on how much you need. Available options are as low as 16GB to as high as 64GB. The video memory has also been upgraded in the iPad 2, allowing games such as Infinity Blade to run quickly and look much better, more realistic even. The figures in Infinity Blade look more closely to real humans than those shown on the first iPad. Overall it is good upgrade to the original in my opinion, since the price of the two is the same starting out.
Knowing the iPad 2 is a good improvement over the original, how does it compare to similar tablet computers in the market? I own an HP Touchpad which is a similar tablet and it is a close comparison. The Touchpad features the same type of display, sporting a 9.7"" IPS technology screen just as the iPad 2. I consider the two being a tie in this category, because there really is not much of a difference. When it comes to overall shape the Touchpad is shorter than the iPad but the same width. I do not see this as being much of a difference either. The iPad 2 is considerably lighter than the touchpad it feels like, this should not matter too many people, the difference is not to major, and with a case the weight equals out. The touchpad has smaller hard drive options than the iPad 2; having only 16GB and 32GB options. I do not know many people that would use the full 64GB of data that can be bought in an iPad 2, but if you need that much than the iPad 2 would be the device to go with. Both my iPad 2 and touchpad have 16GB of data and I do not find myself looking for more space at all. My original iPad has 64GB of data and if I did not put my movies on it, I would have no use for the full 64GB. The camera comparison between the iPad 2 and the touchpad is another tie. While the touchpad only has one, front facing camera, it is of a much higher quality than both of the cameras on the iPad 2. Since the touchpad does not have a camera on the back and iPad 2 does, I give them a tie.  The touchpad has a dual-core processor, just as the iPad 2, but it is .2 gigahertz faster. The .2 gigahertz does not seem to make much of a difference, but since the speed is clocked faster, I give this to the touchpad. The battery life on the touchpad is very close to that of both iPad's. I do not notice much faster drainage between the three devices. A notable difference in the two devices is the speaker quality. The iPad 2 has decent speakers but not the best on the market; on the other hand, the touchpad uses higher quality beats audio, which is argued as some of the best on the market in 2011. It shows this, the sound quality on any music is like comparing static to clear, smooth sound between the two devices.  When it comes to price, originally they were both tied at $499 for the base price, but now the touchpad has been lowered to an extremely good, low price of $99. If you are on a budget and want a nice tablet, the touchpad is for you.
When it comes to software, I have to say the iPad 2 dominates this category all around. The touchpad, which runs on WebOS is a system that does not have near the developers or supporters that the iPad 2 and the app store has. The app store has well over 500,000 applications that can be downloaded for free, or for a small fee to the iPad, whereas the touchpad has only a few 1,000. This attracts many more people to the iPad 2 because there is many more applications for anything you can think of in the app store, the selection of apps is very limited if you are buying the touchpad. If you are using a phone as a main internet connection, you will notice trouble when trying to connect the touchpad to the internet; this is because the touchpad does not support ad-hoc networks. This is a downfall for people like me that live on the iPhone internet tethering; the iPad 2 does support these networks and has no trouble connecting. For most people this will not be an issue but it something that should be known and that I was not aware of when I bought the touchpad. When using the touchpad, it is just as fluid as the iPad 2 when it comes to scrolling between pages of applications and searching through the device.  WebOS itself is not a bad system to use, and if it had more applications I believe it would be a great system.
If you are stuck on deciding a tablet computer to buy, ask yourself what you are expecting. If you want just a simple tablet computer, with no cameras, lots of apps and good ability to function, the iPad 1 would be good. Although if you want a nice, newer tablet with a camera you have to decide how much your budget is? The iPad 2 and the touchpad are close in mostly every category besides the selection of apps, is the price difference of $400 worth the app store? I myself believe the iPad 2 is a wonderful device to have and use if your budget can afford it, otherwise I would highly recommend the $99 HP touchpad."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Pros: The iPad 2 is by the best selling tablet out there. Comparing to other tablets the ipad 2 is far more efficient and worth every penny. You have a front facing webcam to chat with all your facetime buddies and if you have an application you can even chat with android users as well! The touch screen is both elegant and accurate to the exact point of your finger. Also with the new A5 dual-core 1Gz processor this will surpass any applications. However im telling you all the pros about the product and I'm not one of those all out apple fan boys I believe every device out there has a purpose but some are more worthwhile for your money.

Cons: Despite all the good looks and great hardware and software the device is fragile and you must buy a case for it or its prone to scratches unlike most android device they have a much more durable glass one known as gorilla glass. Also the camera isn't even barely a megapixel the quality of the images are horrible and you have a vga front facing camera.

Overall: this is a great buy because the amount of application offered from apple's App Store benefits you more than Androids app store. I have to admit apple's app store has a higher quality of apps and a lot better utilities and such. I use this alot for school so its the perfect tablet to use a researching tool and typing up notes and organizing my work."	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"After nearly 6 months of everyday use, I love this device. It still isn't a full-fledged replacement for a computer, but it's close. iOS 5 is a great step toward that kind of functionality and further improves a product I already loved. I use it for classes, entertainment, work, and as an interactive toy for my 2 year-old son. He LOVES the Sandra Boynton apps and is confused by the physical book versions since the characters don't move like they do on the iPad 2.

This was a great purchase for me and my family that we will enjoy for years to come."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I have been VERY pleased with my purchase!  It came very promptly in the condition as promised and I have hardly put it down since I received it!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Absolutely love the iPad 2. As it is my first tablet, this review will probably not be of interest to many. Do be careful when installing the new iOS for it. Install iTunes updates first then sync iPad then do operating system update.  PC World addresses this issue and will prevent headaches of which people have complained. Still, as a newbie to the tablet scene, I find navigating around a wonderful experience with new-found delights at every touch!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I ordered an Ipad, I recieved an Ipad. I got exactly what I ordered which makes me satisfied. I did arrive early, that made me very happy. Thanks!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"This is an amazing device! Just an oversized iPod Touch? That comparison always amuses me. Really? Ok....then buy an iPod Touch and write letters, and read articles and/books, watch videos, etc. on that tiny little screen. One of the major points of the iPad is it's larger screen!!  Some guy wrote about how the iPad sucks because of fingerprints on the screen. Really??? He must have filthy fingers!! When using my iPad I don't ever see fingerprints that get in the way of using the device. Oh sure, I see them when the unit is OFF, and then I wipe it clean if needed. But when it's on?? Please.
The iPad can be used for almost anything we normal people do- reading, entertainment, shopping, surfing the web. No flash?? True....but really, there are not that many instances that pop up where the lack of Flash is a problem. If it were a real problem, then Apple would not have sold tens of millions of the device thus far. I don't know about others but I know my company switched their entire website to one with HTML 5- good bye Flash. I'm guessing that's going to happen more and more. It has no USB or video out ports?? Ok....then don't buy it! It's amusing how people ""purchase"" the iPad and then moan and complain that it has no USB port or HDMI out ports. Really? You mean....you didn't know that when you bought it?
  Seriously, some of the naysayers for this product that say ""it sucks"" and so on are clueless. This is a FANTASTIC product! Ok....so it IS a little pricey, I'll given them that. But then, so is the Galaxy Tab. Most products of this type that cost much less simply are not worth it. Maybe the Kindle Fire will be? Who knows? But I doubt it."	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"For someone who is technically challenged, it would be helpful to have a couple of pages of basic ""how-to"" instructions. Despite all the hoopla about it being intuitive, I doubt that my wife could have gotten to first base if I had not set up some basic icon shortcuts to sites that I knew she would use. And how does a novice get past their first encounter with a gray screen? That said, it's a pretty slick machine. NOTE: It does not support Flash, so a lot of stuff will pass you by. (Third-party developers claim to have an app that solves this...the verdict appears to still be out on its effectiveness)"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Ok, my wife got the black 16GB several months ago and I inherited a Nook Color which I though would be good enough to use for surfing the web, email, editing and publishing documents, etc...  and after several months of frustration, and seeing how well that iPad 2 worked, I decided to get myself one.

*WOW*

I'm not trying to bash the Nook Color, it is nice for reading magazines and books, not as pleasing on the eyes as the larger iPad 2 screen, but it works.  It's probably more of the limitations of the Android OS that is so frustrating to me, and the lack of real world applications for it.  Yes it has an abundance of applications, but no real apps to do work it seems.

iPad 2 has apps like Pages and Numbers that integrate seamlessly with their counterparts on the computer.  On the other hand Android devices have something called Quickoffice PRO which is supposed to allow you to edit and transfer Office documents between the device and the desktop...  sounds good, but after paying $14.00 for the app I cannot use ANY document with ANY type of formatting on the Android, and the smaller screen makes it hardly usable.  In contrast the only issues I have with Pages is if there is a font that is not available on the iPad, but is on the desktop computer, and I can always find another one that will fit the bill.

The iPad 2 is way ahead of Androids in terms of touchscreen recognition.  The Android was constantly doing things that I didn't want it to do.  For instance I would be attempting to scroll the screen and often times it would instead select an item or link from the screen.  That was uber-frustrating at best.  Trying to do anything on it was a labor of love I guess.  I oft times just got frustrated and moved to a computer to get something done.  The iPad by contrast seems to know exactly whatI am trying to do...  rarely do I have a touchscreen error.

The iPad 2 is sleek, elegant, and has a large enough screen to actually get some work done.  Surfing the web is a breeze and despite the complaints about the lack of a flash plug-in, I surf with relative ease.  Speaking of flash, yes Androids have that, but it doesn't work very well on them.  I struggled on web sites with flash on my Android.  Often times the page would not display correctly anyway, so that's kind of a wash.  And Microsoft is canning flash in Windows 8 as well.  It looks like Steve was right... flash is going away.

iOS 5 with iCloud is an iDream (pun intended).  I can sync all my contacts, my wife's contacts, calendars, Aperture photos, etc...  without any real user interaction.  Just turn the services on and go.  Makes me re-think that OS X Lion Server purchase I made, but I still need that for the older Macs running Tiger and Leopard on my network, and at some point I will probably turn on that XSAN server to create a local SAN RAID...

Numbers files work perfectly and seamlessly between the iPad 2 and the desktop computer, formulas, etc.  That's another problem I had with the Android Quickoffice, it would not understand complex and sometimes simple formulas, so I couldn't use spreadsheets on it at all.

Generally the applications for iOS are far more mature and polished than those available for Android.  The user experience is without a doubt far superior on the iPad 2, apps like Hulu Plus were not even available on the Android which sort of left me scratching my head.  I do have an Android phone that has Hulu Plus on it, so I'm not certain why there wasn't one for the tablet, but it rendered what could have been a nice TV show watching device into a useless for TV device.

iPad 2 is sleek, sexy, stylish, yes.  But it is also a serious workhorse if you are like me and want to do real world work on it.  With a combination of the iPad, and iWork.com I am able to create documents on the iPad or desktop computer, save them to iWork.com, and download them anywhere in any of three possible formats (Pages, PDF, or Word).  The translation to word documents is nearly as flawless as the other transfers, again, sometimes there is a font issue, but that is rare and is easy to fix.

Another problem I had with the Android was the lack of iTunes for it.  Much of my music library is still DRM protected and the Android wouldn't play those files.  iPad 2 by contrast sync's right up and has every one of my songs available to play, and speaking of iCloud -- I have more computers than I need, and having that many leads to problems like the old ""you can only have 5 computers authorized"" when I try to authorize another iTunes library to sync my music.  iCloud eliminates that problem, your new purchases automatically are downloaded from the cloud. And storage is not really an issue with iPad 2 specifically... get the Camera Adapter kit and you can use all the SD cards you want with it.

Back to the iPad 2 - if you are looking to buy a tablet type of computer and are on the fence between an iPad and another, shall I say ""knock-off"", dig into the details.

Some of the Androids may be better than the Nook Color in terms of power, response, screen size, etc... but none of them have a decent office suite or iTunes, they don't have as many accessories available for them, you'll have to use a variety of different services to get iCloud functionality, you cannot use iWork.com with them, Apps are not as abundant and generally are not as mature/polished, syncing with your desktop is a headache - if you can even get it to, etc...

Overall this is one of the best, if not THE best Apple product available.  I have a lot of Apple products these days due to the ease of use, this one is one of the easiest to use and I HIGHLY recommend it!"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The feature comes with the iPad 2 are exactly what I expected. Comparing to iPad, it is thinner and faster on games and other apps. It response quickly and feels smooth while navigating between different processes. The only downside I found that the quality of the photos taken by the camera was not that exciting. In a word, I like this product very much.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I don't know what to say except this.....APPLE IS AWESOME!!!!!!! I didn't know what I was missing until this wonderful device came along. Buy it, you will not be sorry!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This is really a great little device. I've had it for over a month now and no real complaints. The video quality is amazing and the speakers are surprisingly powerful. I think the only question is - is it worth the price tag? And I suppose the answer is more dependent on the person than anything else.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Nothing negative can be said about this product. Great item, arrived within days of order in perfect condition.  Ready to use right out of the box.  Great experience from this supplier.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I am late on the iPad bandwagon. Although I have multiple iPods and also an iPhone owner, this is the first time we are getting ourselves an iPad in the household.

This is wonderful device. Just like what they did in the IpodTouch, the amazing thing is how they were able to squeezed so much technology in such a small space.

By the way, this is a review of the iPad 2.  The first iPad, we skipped it completely.  There are many tablets in the market but it is really tough to compete with iPad. First, the interface.  This is what Apple is known for.  The simplicity, usability and ease of use of such a very compliated hardware is a miracle in itself.  I have tried other devices that are similar but the most of them seems to be  a  tad slower and  less smart.

Another big factor that is strongly going for the iPad is the number of apps availalble in the Apple store.  Android is starting to compete, specially now with big online stores like Amazon taking the challenge.  Still, it will take some time to really match the number and the quality of the apps in iTunes. Apple is also known for being strict in approving apps being sold in the App store.

Funny thing is, what made me pull the trigger to finally buy an iPad despite the high tag price is the HP Touchpad fiasco.  I ordered one when it was advertised for $99.  I was ecstatic to have my order received and placed through Barnes & Noble,  only to be notified the next day that my order was cancelled.  Due to frustration, I walked in to the closest Apple store and got me one.

What really amazed me is the usefullness of the tablet in education. I have heard so many times that it is good for kids who have autism and one of my kids was diagnosed with autism. He is so focused when playing with it.
My kids have DSs but most of the games are just for fun and entertainment. They get a little bit of learning at the beginning, but after that it is repetitive and just time waste.

There are amazing educational apps like the following:
- Word Bingo
- Math Bingo
- Teach Me
- Presidents vs Aliens
- Stack the States.
- Brainquests series
- Write On (for learning cursive writing)

NO FLASH:

iPad2 still does not support flash.  There are Aps that you can use to play flash on websites  like iShifter, etc.  It is not perfect but at least it works.

SKYPE:

One of the advantages the iPad2 against iPad1 is that now you can do video calls with Skype or Yahoo Messenger."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This is like having a computer in your grasp every moment you require one.  Outstanding speed and clarity.  The learning curve is gentle but every day you learn more.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I was apprehensive re: dropping a nice piece of change on a tablet and wasn't really sure if I really needed a tablet. I have a couple of laptops and have owned a netbook for a couple of years. I bought the netbook because of its portability, size, and relative light weight when I am on the road.
Throwing caution to the wind, I bought this  Ipad2 and it was instant love. Installation was a snap and took a matter of minutes per the instruction card which comes with the device as well as accompanying online prompts. There are a huge number of applications available for the IPad and many of them are free; others are available at minimal cost. The learning curve for using this device is fast; if you own an IPhone it is even faster. The platform this is built on is similar in operation to the IPhone. As for installing new apps, I have yet to encounter any installation problems with my add ons, though some people have.
If you install the ereader app, it negates the need for a Kindle or Nook. While I'm not about to toss my Kindle, this is a nice alternative to carting around yet another device when I travel.
The battery's charge is supposed to last about 10 hours. That is a fairly accurate measure as I've been averaging about 9 to 10 hours before draining the charge.
The device's design is truly a work of art. While this is not a very constructive comment re: to buy or not to buy, I'm driven by aesthetics. I'm drawn to attractiveness and functionality. I own a lot of Apple products and their purchase has partially been driven on visual appeal and cleverness, though ultimately i have fallen in love with their ease of operation and their ability to go way beyond most folks'  imagination. What I am trying to say is that even if you buy this blindly assuming that it will do most of the things your laptop does you'll probably be surprised by its many added features. The  Ipad2 is very light and portable. It is easy to hold and with a smart cover or case that converts to a stand, it works great on a  flat surface or a lap. It can slip easily into a purse. I usually carry a small or medium Ameribag and have no problem getting it to fit. In order to keep this pad in pristine condition and safe, I installed a screen protector, a back cover, and a smart cover. For what it's worth, this pad is nifty but I wouldn't try to see if it will bounce if dropped. Additional accessories are readily available such as Bluetooth keyboards, headsets, and external speakers.
The 32 GB capacity is more than adequate for my needs. However, an application junkie may need 64GB. I mention this because my son is upgrading because he wants to add more apps and is running out of space. 16GB or 32GB is probably adequate for most users.
Response time is robust on this little sucker. While I didn't buy the 3G model, I haven't had a problem attaching to free WiFi and reception has always been good given that I'm usually in populous areas.
The pad's sound quality is good as well as the screen's image. The camera is o.k., but I prefer my IPhone's camera or better yet a high res dedicated camera.
While I had no previous experience with IPad's first incarnation, IPad2 seems to be an improvement over the first release due to
faster processing speed and a lighter and more compact design. While there is no slot for an SD card, I suspect that subsequent IPads will feature better and/or more sophisticated cameras and video conferencing capabilities, and an SD card slot among other things.
Bottom line: the IPad2 is a fantastic device that is more versatile  than a netbook but lacks some of the functionality of a fully integrated laptop. It's compact size and light weight is a big draw as is its ease of operation and performance."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The Apple ipad2 is an extremely versatile tablet computer. You have nearly immediate response when you go to the internet. You can download books, games, or nearly anything from the itunes store or Amazon. The tablet must be sychronized with a master computer which must be done with a usb connector to the master computer. This is usually done when a new item is purchased and downloaded. The tablet is light and easy to carry. The battery lasts a long time.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The iPad 2 is amazing!  My  2 year old daughter loves the fun and engaging educational apps.  I love it because it is easy to use and travel with opposed to a netbook or laptop.  Truly a great piece of techknoelegy.	5	electronics

I' like so much

It's a very worth inversion to be update"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I take this tablet everywhere with me.  This is my preferred tablet to forget in the University Bookstore.  I can not recommend it enough.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"After five months of using a 16GB iPad 2 WiFi (no 3G), I can honestly say that it is one of the most useful technology purchases I can think of. While its price may scare many people away, its usefulness can justify its price, especially when compared to other devices that perform similar tasks. Not a day has gone by in the last five months where the iPad 2 hasn't been used several times, usually by several family members.

Apple would like everyone to think that the iPad is revolutionary. Skeptics and critics scoff at the idea, but I would agree that it is a revolutionary product much in the same way that the Netbook (ASUS eeePC, et al) was a revolutionary product.

Both products created a new paradigm in how you look at accessing information, media, and other tasks, and once you use them, you find it difficult to go back to the traditional devices. Netbooks nearly killed laptops, but in turn are getting killed themselves by tablets. People loved the small size of netbooks, but the keyboards and displays were often too small. Compared to an iPad, a typical netbook is too clunky and too heavy. Those with the need for a keyboard need the larger keyboard that a laptop provides, and those that don't embraced tablets as quickly as they could.

Using the iPad for any length of time will make you not want to use your desktop PC for browsing the web or reading E-Mail. It's much more natural to hold a tablet in your lap or place it on the table next to you while having breakfast than it is to go into the other room and use a PC to do the same. Laptops are more portable than desktop PC's, but in comparison, they are much bulkier and many laptops have horrible battery life that don't come close to the 10 hours that one can get from the iPad 2.

That's not to say that desktop and laptop PC's don't have their place. They definitely do. If you're doing anything complex that requires a keyboard or a mouse, those other devices shine. However, if you're composing a normal E-Mail, browsing the web, reading news feeds, checking Facebook, or watching videos on Hulu or YouTube, the iPad does these things very well. Typing on the on-screen keyboard, especially in landscape mode, is very easy and I've gotten quite fast at doing so. The picture quality on the screen is very good; probably better than most laptop and desktop PC monitors are, and the touch interface is so natural that it doesn't require hardly any orientation to get comfortable using the interface.

Browsing the web is a joy on the 10"" screen. Sure, not having Flash compatibility is a pain sometimes, but Flash is one of those technologies of the past that is dwindling in popularity with the advent of HTML5, and it's in the site owner's best interests to develop versions of their sites that don't rely on Flash to do things that should have been done in other ways long before iOS devices came along. It's an occasional annoyance, but I don't consider the lack of Flash a dealbreaker in my mind. Web sites that don't work on the iPad are losing the business of the many that have iOS-based devices, and there are plenty of other sites that provide the same service that don't lean on the Flash crutch.

Reading E-Mail using the built-in E-Mail app is also very good. I prefer the sidebar list of E-Mails that appears in landscope mode over the popup menu listing in portrait mode, but that's a personal preference. GMail integration is smooth, and being able to access multiple accounts makes it easy to check several mailboxes, either in one megalist or as separate accounts. The calendar app integrates with Google Calendar and the contacts from GMail are available in the Contacts list on the iPad as well. The integration with Google's various apps is very good.

One of the best features of the iPad is the ecosystem that is built around the device. Apple has done a great job of supplying a major part of that by creating an AppStore with thousands of apps for just about every purpose one could think of. The iTunes store provides music, movies, and books for sale, but I prefer supplying my own music and movies, and Amazon's Kindle app / Kindle books is much more flexible and a better way to buy books in my opinion. On top of the software, the popularity of the iPad means that there are multitudes of accessories that cover the iPad, plug into the iPad, or otherwise complement the iPad in some way. No other portable device manufacturer has the 3rd party support that Apple has and that advantage shouldn't be overlooked.

Speaking of accessories, I did a lot of looking at cases, and I settled on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/AYL-100-Premium-Genuine-Slim-Leather-Case-Folio-with-Magnetic-Closure-and-3-in-1-built-in-Stand-for-Apple-Ipad-2nd-Generation-Tablet-Black/dp/B004WHI9L4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">AYL 100% Premium Genuine Slim Leather Case Folio with Magnetic Closure and 3-in-1 built-in Stand for Apple Ipad 2nd Generation Tablet (Black)</a>. It's a folio style cover that works very well in protecting the device while not adding too much bulk. I highly recommend getting some kind of case, and this one is nearly perfect.

The iPad 2 costs a lot of money. That makes it out of reach of some people, so it's not a slam-dunk. However, if you compare it to the cost of a new laptop or desktop PC, it's not out of line. If you're reading E-Mail, looking at videos, and browsing the web, the iPad does these things very well. You'll still need another device that will store your digital camera photos, keep track of your finances, and do the complex tasks that a desktop/laptop can do, but you'll need that device much less once you've discovered the ease of using something like this for those everyday tasks that don't require a full-sized keyboard and full-blown Windows programs to accomplish.

No other tablet device currently available on the market has come close to the capabilities and the ecosystem that the iPad enjoys. I had hopes that the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ASUS-Eee-Pad-Transformer-TF101-A1-10-1-Inch-Tablet-Computer-Tablet-Only/dp/B004U78J1G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ASUS Eee Pad Transformer TF101-A1 10.1-Inch Tablet Computer (Tablet Only)</a>&nbsp;would take it on, but it seems hampered by software issues (trying to do too much and be too flexible can be troublesome), the Androad app market still trails the iOS app market considerably, and the number of accessories available pales in comparison.

The best non-iOS device that I think has a chance of being a contender is the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kindle-Fire-Full-Color-7-Multi-touch-Display-Wi-Fi/dp/B0051VVOB2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kindle Fire, Full Color 7"" Multi-touch Display, Wi-Fi</a>. It has a great price point, it has Amazon standing behind it with an ecosystem that includes an AppStore, music store, video store for TV and movies, and the excellent Kindle books system, which is almost an ecosystem all by itself. I'm very interested to see how the Kindle Fire accomplishes the tasks of a tablet device and I hope that it can be a contender in the marketplace.

Anyone interested in a tablet device should be looking at the major products that are available and see how those products serve their needs. While the iPad 2 is a major investment, I don't regret making the purchase. I think the iPad 2 is hard to beat!"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I am more than pleased with my new ipad2.  I struggled with the decision to buy it but it was a good decision.

One unexpected plus was I found it was so easy to use the free Kindle app to move all my Kindle books over to the iPad.  Now I can read from either device and my husband and  I don't fight over the Kindle anymore.

One negative is that I was  surprised and disappointed that there was no user's manual included.  At the price one pays I think it is pretty cheap of Apple to not include a manual . . . What other device or piece of equipment that costs $600+ doesn't come with instructions for use?"	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"Our son gave this iPad to my husband as a gift (a complete surprise since it is a pretty expensive gift!).  My husband had just purchased a computer for me as a birthday gift coincidentally, and it had a hard drive failure the 3rd time it booted up.  So we returned it and bought a second iPad 2 for me.  We are completely addicted.  They are so user friendly, work well, and are instant on and off (instead of waiting forever to boot up and shut down like a computer).  We both absolutely love them.

You iPad may not have the latest operating system on it since many have been sitting in stores waiting to be sold.  If it has 4.3.5 or older, then you simply can take it to a Verizon store and have them activate it at no charge.  They are an official Apple Store.

If you need to update your iPad 2 to the new IOS 5 that is to be released in October 2011, then I have some tips, to possibly prevent a lot of grief. HOWEVER, you can just skip all the rest of the technical part of my review if you pay a small fee to have operating system IOS 5 downloaded onto your new iPad 2 so that it is completely independent of a regular computer and iTunes. This is a huge step that Apple has been developing for awhile now.  I don't know if Verizon will do it for free, but Best Buy will do it for $29.95.  If you go to Verizon, make sure the employee is quite familiar with activating the iPad, etc.  Our local Verizon person acted like she knew, but when I brought it home, it wasn't activated.  That's why I had to go through all this stuff so I could do it on my own computer.

The current operating system as of today requires hook up to a computer that has iTunes on it.  The new ""IOS 5"" is due to come out in the next 10-15 days, between October 10-15, 2011.  Anyone who buys an iPad 2 that already has IOS 5 loaded and, also, anyone who already owns an ipad 2 who updates to this version; will be able to do everything without being dependent upon a computer and iTunes.  Right now, you upload photos, your own music, and download and install updates via your computer using iTunes on a regular computer. You can load these things by emailing to your iPad from your computer where they are stored, but if you have a lot, it is easier to transfer via iTunes on your computer.

My review is long and some is very technical.  You can stop here if I've already given you helpful info you wanted to know.  The very next section is about some apps I recommend and then after that is the very technical part that isn't necessary if you don't have a computer or want to take my suggestion and pay to have IOS 5 installed on your iPad.

------

Before I get on with the heavy-duty technical part that you may or may not want read, let me recommend a few apps that you can purchased inexpensively.  Part of the fun is customizing your iPad with apps that you enjoy or help you with your tasks:

1. A free app for the iPad is ""Goodreader.""  This is a great app.  You can view about any format of a file in this app, even Excel files.  You can also make annotations with various symbols and highlighting that the program offers.  You can also unzip a zip file in Goodreader.  I've never done it, but you can watch a video in that app as well.  It has a great folder and file management system that is easy.  I believe you can even bring in files to your iPad from your computer via wi-fi or ftp.  You can also save a web page for reading off line when you are not near wi-fi, such as on an airplane.  I really like this program.

2.  If you like to use Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel, you can get these apps, but they are $20 each.  I have two excel spreadsheets that I like to keep up on a daily or weekly basis.  One, for example, are our household expenditures and deposits.  Since Goodreader doesn't let you actually add to a Word document or Excel file, I found a program called ""Office 2 HD.""  This one is not free.  It is a $6.99 program plus fee and tax, but that is less than you pay for either Word or Excel.  It's pretty easy.  What I did was email to myself my Excel file from my computer.  I opened the email in iPad 2 and clicked on the attached file.  Then I tapped on the little curved arrow that you would tap if you want to reply to or forward an email and it gave me the option of opening the file in either Goodreader or Office 2 HD.  I selected Office 2 HD.  Then I opened that app, opened that file, and tapped the Save button.  The Save button gives you a choice of Save or Save As.  When you want to be able to type in the file, you choose Save As and rename it.  If you don't want to rename the file, than add a ""1"" to the file name on your computer before you email it to yourself on iPad; and then when you Save As, just delete the 1.  Easy.  Of course, it works differently inserting rows, etc., than a regular spreadsheet of Excel program, so you really do need to refer to their help menu.  I like the program though, because it is inexpensive and lets me keep up edit my favorite already existing spreadsheets.  You can create new ones also, of course.  I haven't used the word processor yet, but it is probably even easier than a spreadsheet.  Oh, it has a Power Point type program in it also.

3.  Right now the default Safari brower on the iPad isn't very good.  I'm very spoiled to using tabs so I can open search listings in a new tab without losing my search page or use the tabs to go back and forth comparing info on two or three different web pages.  The new IOS 5 is giving Safari tabs.  However, I really like ""Web Perfect Browser"" which is only $3.99 plus fee and tax.  Not only does it provide a tab system for browsing, but will also save web pages for offline reading.  I save a web page in the Browser if it is something I want to read later, but not necessarily save.  I save a web page in Goodreader, if I want to keep it for reference.  I don't know all the changes they are going to make in Safari.  You might go ahead and check it all out before buying Web Perfect Browser in case it is good enough for your purposes.

4.  A great picture organizer program is ""Photo Mgr Pro.""  Once again, the new IOS 5 is making big improvements on the default photo.  Perhaps you won't even need this app.  The current default Photo app is terrible.  You cannot put them in the order you want.  As far as I know, the only way to create Albums (folders) is to arrange the folders you want in a special iPad folder on your computer first and then upload the special folder and its contents to the iPad through iTunes.  You still can't arrange the order, however.  I know they have made improvements in the new operating system; but if you don't like it, try the Photo Mgr Pro.  It's good.

By the way, the final price of an app varies because some are Apple apps and some are 3rd-Party developers.  The developers do get a fee from each purchase.  All apps have tax added.  I'm not sure how this works, but I do notice that the difference between the app purchase price and the final price is not always the same percentage.  However, apps are so reasonably priced, it just isn't that important.  Just know that when it says $3.99, it actually will be a little more.

---------

THE TECHNICAL PART OF MY REVIEW REGARDING PROBLEMS UPDATING OR INSTALLING ITUNES:

It isn't a big deal using your computer and iTunes (if you have a computer) unless you have the following problems that I ran into.  Here are a couple of solutions below.

DON'T LET MY INSTRUCTIONS SCARE YOU.  REMEMBER, you can just have IOS 5 put on it after its released, and you don't have to deal with any of this. By the way, if you don't have a computer, you can take the iPad to a Verizon store to activate it. They don't charge for it since they are contracted by Apple. Best Buy may also do it for a small fee when you don't buy it there.  Best Buy will also download and install updates for you for $29.95, so wait until the new IOS 5.0 is released and have them put that one on it.  That eliminates the computer and iTunes problem since you will be able update and download from the iPad. (I'm repeating, but knowing how to do this with ease and avoiding the problems is valuable to know.)

Now back to the iTunes problem.  NOTE:  My instructions are for a PC with XP. It is possible you won't be able to install the latest version of iTunes.  You need a version later than the 9.0 and above series.  It must start with a 10.0 or later for it to be connected to your ipad.  I use version 10.4.1.  I discovered that since I apparently had some previous version of iTunes and/or Quick Time on my computer, it left behind some kind of language.  Therefore, after I downloaded itunes version 10.4.1 and attempted to install it; it appeared to install, but wouldn't open.  An error message appeared saying there were missing files.  After spending 3 days researching off and on for the solution and trying to reinstall etc., I finally found a document on the Internet stating exactly what to remove and how to do it. INSTRUCTIONS: From the PC via Add and Remove Programs in the Control Panel remove iTunes.  Then you remove Apple Application Support.  You don't have to uninstall Quick Time.  Then you close and reboot.  Don't open any programs, but do shutdown firewall and anti-virus programs and turn off your DSL/broadband.  Now you can go to your iTunes install file you saved and install it. Now it will work, or it may say something about Mobile Device Service not started. If so, open Control Panel again and open Administrative Tools.  Open the ""Services"" folder. Click ONCE on Apple Mobile Device folder.  To the left of the file, it says ""Stop the Service"" and ""Start the Service.""  Click on ""Stop the Service"" and then click on ""Start the Service.""  I can't remember if you reboot again, but it will tell you. After this, iTunes, should work just fine unless some other cause is creating your problem.

NEXT PROBLEM that many people are having is that iTunes will perform all the functions for your iPad except it won't download an OS (Operating System) Update.  It will act like it's downloading, but eventually times out.  I have a solution, but you can confirm that your problem is the same as mine by doing the following:  Open iTunes and click on Help on the menu.  Select ""Run Diagnostics"".  Uncheck everything except the first line to do a Connectivity Test. Make sure your DSL or wi-fi is connected. Click Next. Click Next again and it will list test results.  The first two lines will have green dots, meaning ok.  The third line will be red, ""Secure Link to iTunes Store Failed.""  What is peculiar about this is that I can purchase an app through the store, but can't download an update.  The problem is somewhere in conflicting language or programs.  After 3 more days of trying to fix, it I finally found a webpage that lists direct links to Apple and instructions.  You choose your particular kind of iPad; for example, iPad 2 wi-fi only.  Then you download the file and save it to a folder where you won't forget where it is.  Be aware that is is a 690 MG file!  It takes hours to download.  I have DSL ""light"" which means it is slower than regular hi-speed, so it took my file 8 hours to download. Make sure your Power settings say never so the computer won't sleep during the download.  It's ok if your monitor sleeps or the desk top activates a screen saver. By the way, I also was not able to download it on my computer than has iTunes.  I had to use my very old computer that has never had iTunes on it.  My itunes computer blocked downloads even directly from Apple!  If you don't have another computer, use someone else's computer that doesn't have iTunes. OR just wait for IOS 5 (release in Oct. 2011) and pay Best Buy $29.95 to download it and install! After downloading it, I put it on a flash drive and transferred it to my other computer that has iTunes.  Next, plug in iPad to your computer via the cable included; do this BEFORE opening iTunes.  If you haven't already activated your new iPad 2, then you will be activating it now through iTunes.  Once it is activated, you are ready to install the update you downloaded, which will IOS 5 after it released. iTunes may pop up a window that asks if you want to download the update.  Press Cancel.  If it is set up to automatically download it, press the X next to the field at the top where it is showing that is is downloading.  That will stop it.  NOW, since your iTunes will not work for downloading if you have the same connectivity issue that I do, you will HOLD DOWN your shift key WHILE you press the UPDATE button.  You will only see the UPDATE button if you plugged in your ipad first to your computer and then open iTunes.  A menu just for your iPad will appear across the middle of the screen and the Update button is on the Summary tab.  After you hold down the shift key while clicking on Update, it will pop up a screen allowing you to find your downloaded file.  If you computer downloaded it as a ZIP file, you'll have to unzip it first and then choose the file.  iTunes will now update your iPad with the new update.  It takes about 10 min or less.  By the way, I have Opera browser on my old computer and discovered that it doesn't force a zip file as some browsers do.  It will download the file as it actually comes with the correct file extension.

Hope this review doesn't scare you off.  Remember!  You don't have to deal with any of these problems if you pay a store that is set up for iPads to download the new IOS 5 operating system which makes iPad completely independent of a separate computer and iTunes.  Again, I don't know what Verizon would charge, but $29.95 is pretty good at Best Buy.  Call first to make sure the stores near you will do it.

Have fun with Ipad 2.  It's great!  I'm quite advanced on PC's as I used them for the last 15 years for my jobs.  Now I'm retired, and the Ipad 2 is just great fun and new Apps to let you customize it for your own interests are very reasonable."	5	electronics

It is easy to use, as intuitive as can be, and is a delight to own and use.

So far, (two weeks after delivery), I ha ve downloaded a few games, plus chess, and a book, plus my subscription to two magazines.

The iPad is kind of like a cyber-friend, it is there at the ready to play or do whatever, just like a happy puppy.  As a matter-of-fact, were I in charge of product-naming at Apple, this thing would have been named the iPuppy, it is just a fun creation all the way.

Had I to do it again, I would repeat the purchase.

B0013FRNKG	"I'm not a tech guy. In fact, I generally loathe having to deal with computers and technology. Unfortunatly, since I own my own business I spend a large part of my day sending e-mails, processing orders, and doing book keeping, so much of my day is spent interacting with technology. I also spend a good portion of my day on the road, and until recently I had to lug my laptop around. Whenever I found down time, wherever I was, I'd have to bring it out, wait for it to boot up, log on to the internet, get my work done, then wait for it to shut down. It got the job done, but it was heavy and awkward to carry around, and uncomfortable to use in the car.

I'd been considering switching to a tablet for a long time, and when I finally decided to go ahead and make the switch I researched every tab on the market. I spent a lot of time testing tabs at the electronics stores. Some just weren't very intuitive, and getting them to perform required more effort than I was willing to invest. Some were choppy. Some seemed to crash every 5 minutes.

The one that always operated beautifully was the Ipad 2. Unfortunately, my business requires that I watch videos my clients send me, and the lack of flash support worried me. Ultimately I decided I could use the Ipad on the road and watch whatever videos I couldn't get to play when I got home to my computer.

Set up was very easy - and I'm not the most computer literate guy. Downloaded Itunes, plugged the Ipad in, and it was up and running. Within an hour the lack of flash support became annoying... Then I did a bit of research and found an App for $4.99 that allowed me to view flash on my Ipad flawlessly! The Ipads one limitation was solved for less than $5.00! Now I have Apps that simplify every element of my business. Maps, record keeping, creating documents...

The Ipad is wonderful to travel with. Day to day, on the road locally, it is light and slim, easy to take with my wherever I go. When I need to access records or check my e-mail I no longer have to wait for my laptop to boot up, with the touch of a button my Ipad is up and running, and on the internet moments later.

The battery life is stunning... It keeps me entertained and/or productive on long flights, and in hotel rooms in unfamiliar cities.

I very rarely use my laptop since I got my Ipad. My Ipad does everything my laptop did for me, only it usually does it faster and easier. In fact, the main thing I wish I could change about the Ipad is the fact that it needs a computer to sync with (though it only needs to do this very rarely)... I wish it were a completely independant device so I could just set my laptop aside completely and let it gather dust.

The Ipad isn't 100% perfect. The camera isn't impressive at all. Watching flash requires downloading and using a seperate web browser app (I generally use Safari, overall its a better browser than the flash enabled one. When I run into a flash issue, I copy the address, open the Photon app and paste the address there) It's slightly annoying to have to take the extra steps, but it's not a huge issue.

Overall, I couldn't be happier with it!"	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"I was given an iPad 2 for Mother's Day this year and it is truly one of the best gifts I've ever received! I have a large family, and every person here uses the iPad on a regular basis. It's been in use for the last 5+ months from morning until night and I am still delighted and amazed with it.

I'd never personally owned a tablet before, or an Apple product, but we have multiple computers and all manner of electronic devices in our home and most people would consider me and my family to be techies. Because we have laptops and desktops and netbooks and smart phones, I didn't think that a tablet would particularly add to our level of connectivity or productivity. I was so wrong.

Upon opening my iPad2, I was instantly struck by its thinness and its simplicity. There was just the tablet and a charger and a small, welcome pamphlet. I turned it on and it gracefully guided me through setting up my wireless connection. It offered me a tutorial, but I was too excited to bother with that. I was surfing the net within seconds because the interface is so intuitive.

By now, there are loads of reviews that go into detail about the cameras and other hardware featured on the iPad2 so rather than bore you, I will focus on some of the real world ways this tablet has changed the way we do things in my home.

As a homeschooling mother of a 9 year old, this tablet has made the best things about learning at home even better! The battery life is so good that we keep it with us all over the house. No need to worry about being near a power supply or booting up time or any of that. The iPad 2 is always connected, always ready. There are literally thousands of amazing apps, many of them free, that enrich my child's learning day. He is working on improving his handwriting and using an app that lets him write right on the screen! If he makes a mistake, it prompts him to try again until he gets the hang of it. Math, reading, journaling, science, anatomy, astronomy, geography, music - there's an app for that!

Having the iPad2 has meant that whenever my son wonders about something or asks a question about something, we have the answers right in our hands. Remember when you didn't know how to spell a word or a definition in school? Remember how the teacher told you to go look it up? This is like that, only a thousand times better because there is no walk of shame past the whole class to the big dictionary. My son looks up things all day long just because he WANTS to!

There are several exceptional music programs that feature an electronic keyboard. My favorite cost a couple of dollars and my boy is now playing music. It translates well, too, because I have a piano and he is able to play tunes he learned on the iPad on our full size piano.

Of course, there are games, too. Lots of them. This has been a real boon when we go on road trips. Even though there is no wi-fi in the car, my son has loads of apps to keep him entertained until we reach our destination. No more asking ""are we there yet""?

I have a 15 month old granddaughter who is becoming very iPad saavy, too. It amazed me that even a young toddler quickly grasps the concept of icons and different apps doing different things. She actually knows how to turn it on and choose the correct folder to find the Fruit Ninja app and successfully launch it and play! There are several other games she enjoys, as well as some delightful alphabet games and story book apps. She also enjoys having us take video of her with the iPad and then play it back for her.

I generally have it with me in the kitchen at meal times because I can look up a recipe and have it in front of me while cooking. Or I can watch a movie with the Netflix app while baking or preparing more complicated meals. If I didn't have a Kindle already, I would be using the Kindle app to read ebooks, too. Thanksgiving won't be nearly as tedious for me this year because of my iPad.

I now take it with me when I travel instead of my laptop because it fits in my purse! I got a bluetooth keyboard to go with it so even when I need to type a lot, it's no problem (although the virtual keyboard is responsive and quicker to type on than you might think). I spent several days at a hospital with a friend and the iPad allowed us both to keep up with email, google for further medical info, and even watch a movie. I've discovered that there is wi-fi almost everywhere! (That's good because I didn't choose the 3G version.) My friend was so impressed that she bought an iPad as soon as she got home!

Even though the device is almost fantastically thin and elegant, I would caution you to purchase and use a case all the time with your iPad. The screen is plenty tough but I have read many, many warnings about dropping it on one of it's corners, which results in the screen shattering. A case is good insurance and many of them feature the magnetic on/off, which conserves battery charge while protecting your iPad when you aren't using it.

Other nice, but not essential, accessories are a protective screen film, a capacitive-style stylus, and an extra charger/car adapter. If you will be using your iPad as a replacement for a notebook on a regular basis, a wireless, bluetooth keyboard is nice, too. But other than a good case, the iPad2 needs nothing else to be up and running straight out of the box.

Highly, highly recommended."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Great service, product arrived in good order and timely fashion. Product is functional, thus far. Supplier also had good follow-up and follow-through.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Excellent product very happy with it. The battery last much longer than the first edition of ipad,better resolution and excellent camera. The only bad thing Apple should send you a free cover because of what your paying.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Best Thing I bought this year! It controls my TV AppleTV and is a great book reader for my son. My wife uses it on the train for homework. The battery is lasting so long I am very happy with it!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I wanted to focus a bit on just one thing I love about tablets. They provide you a very portable second screen. I happened to pick the iPad 2 after a lot of research with other tablets.

I am away from home a lot during the day for work and class and also at night as I study. As a college student and future programmer I love having the iPad as a second screen. I can have my Kindle and PDF textbooks, web tutorials or HTML help apps open on the iPad as I type notes and program on my laptop. I am not constantly having to minimize or switch between windows on my laptop screen, which is pretty nice. I can also have Netflix, the ABC app or Hulu playing as I do homework. The small size of the iPad allows for me to slip it right into the same case as my laptop, awesome! They have some laptops now that have a pull out second screen but it seems to be an expensive option that leaves no other features like the iPad (or another tablet) does.

iPads also have a lot of other fun features besides providing you with more screen real-estate when you aren't doing homework or programming!

The End

*I am a fan of Apple, have been since the early 90's when in 1st grade I was blown away by the amazing Oregon Trail (yes I know it was MECC software) on the IIGS in all it's green glory. I now own many Apple products. I am also a fan of Microsoft, work on Win XP and 7 at work everyday and have no issues with Windows. I also play pretty hard on the Xbox 360 in my down time. I use Google's services across multiple platforms. I run Win7 and OSX on my Apple laptop. I run Linux, although not as much as the other operating systems."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Great product exactly as they promote it. What you see is beyond what you expect to see. Something not so good connectivity with pc (file exchange).	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"I put off getting an iPad forever. I wanted one SO BADLY, but found it impossible to justify the purchase. Who needs an iPad when you have a desktop, an iPhone, and a laptop? An iPad would be a total waste of money, right? Well, now I finally have an iPad 2, and OH MY GOODNESS, HOW DID I LIVE WITHOUT IT ALL THIS TIME?!?!?

The iPad is amazing. You are all familiar with the impressive  technical details, I'm sure. Incredibly thin. Unbelievably lightweight. Spectacularly clear screen. Amazing battery life. The list goes on and on. However, the product description doesn't tell you how the iPad will change your life. Seriously, it has changed mine. I have no need to drag a heavy laptop around now that I have my iPad. As someone who rarely uses word processing programs anymore, the iPad has rendered my laptop practically useless. It also has some awesome word processing apps, so if I do need to type something, I can do so with ease, even using a touch screen. It's so nice to be able to pull this out of my bag and have instant Internet access with an amazing screen wherever I am. I have the 32GB version with wi-fi, and have plenty of space to store movies, music, apps, whatever. My iPad is with me wherever I go. I especially love having it handy when I'm at home, relaxing on the couch. It's so easy and comfortable to use the iPad wherever. I am a very happy customer!"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This Ipad is the best thing since mankind was invented.  It will change the computing paradigm as we know it. Intuitive, fast, complete, long batter life - exactly as offered!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Got this for my wife's birthday and she loves it.  She uses it to pass the time in the car when we travel and with the Wifi otpion she can check her emails and facebook (with the grandkids) where ever we spend the night.  We sync it with the IPhones 4 so everything is there on both items. There are so many apps that really lets you select things that meet your personality.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I love this product.  It is so sleek and so fast and I love reading on it.  That's the main reason I bought it.  But there is so much more!  I have lots to learn about it but that's ok.  Having so much fun with it and so happy to be able to read books so clearly and so comfortably.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I have got on Amazon Apple iPad 2 MC769LL/A Tablet (16GB, Wifi, Black) NEWEST MODEL (Purchased on 08/15/2011)
by Apple
It does what it should do and for these who is interested in technical details I recommend to go to Apple web site and see.

I would very highly regard the seller  ""ALLDISCOUNT"" who did excellent job of communication , delivery and quality"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"We put a SwitchEasy cover on our iPad 2 immediately to protect it, and after many months in a house of 4, it still looks and performs the same as it did in the early days.

It's a beautiful unit, with a weight that beats out the other tablets.  But really, it isn't the quick loading time, ease of multi-tasking, handsome hardware, beautiful resolution, or even cost that made us get this over other tablets.  It's the ability to have so many tens of thousands of applications.

I use Kindle app, Moviefone, Scrabble, Netflix, and Groupon all the time.

My 3 year old uses Angry Birds, Cut the Rope, and wide variety of educational apps and games.

My 6 month old loves Itsy Bitsy Spider and other children's apps with music and interactivity. She loves to send the spider climbing.

My husband loves playing with the newest apps like Vid Rhythm (from the company that makes Rock Band).

When my husband's parents visited from England, they loved it that the daily crossword puzzle on The Guardian's website was FREE and interactive.

We all love getting on Skype to speak to family in other countries.  The camera is great and I even took it outside last weekend to show my sister how well my tomatoes are doing.

On early weekend mornings, we usually put educational DVDs for my son. However, my husband likes to watch England Premier League football. So what he does is watch it on the iPad while my son gets to watch his DVDs...everyone is happy!

It's been stepped on, dropped, taken to the beach, on picnics, and has endured a lot of use with no problems.  And through all of that it has given us so much entertainment, access to information, connection with friends and family (Facebook, Skype, email, you name it), peace at the restaurant (""here, why don't you play with Thomas the Tank Engine?""), and something to do while sitting in a hospital (streaming Netflix instead of the $12 daily charge at the hospital).

It's absolutely wonderful."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Great product, very addictive, I have move all the things that I wasn't suppose to do in my laptop to the iPad 2 (internet browsing, personal email, pictures, movies, calendars, TV, news, e-Books, etc) it seems just like the right device for it, so now my laptop is only for work.
Highly recommended."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"This product rocks...everyone know it ...and it does 1) ease of use
  2) Powerful
  3) Efficient
  4) Replaces my desktop

Double thumbs up!"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Nothing I can say bad about the Ipad 2.  I have pretty much quit using my pc since getting the Ipad2.  I know a lot of people have said the Ipad2 wasn't meant to take the place of a laptop or pc but thats relative to what you use a pc for.  For me its easily taken the place of my laptop.  If what you do is surf the web and use Itunes then the Ipad will be what you need and its so much more convienent than having to go to my computer everytime I want to look up a score of a game or see a movie review.  I would recommend the Ipad2 to anyone.

I also read lots of books and I must say reading books on the Ipad vs. The Kindle is no comparison either.  The Ipad's ibooks look so much better and I like the feel a lot better than the Kindle.  Kindle also makes a big deal about being able to locate a book and be reading it within 60 seconds.....so can I on the Ipad.  So I don't know why they are trying to use that as a great feature."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	As an iMac and iPod Touch owner, I knew that I would enjoy the iPad before I purchased it.  What I didn't realize is that it would become the device that I use more than any other.  Great device with great apps available.  I feel lost if I leave home without it.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	After a horrifying experience with a different vendor for this product, It was gratifying to have my IPAD2 arrive as described (NEW) and in a very timely fashion.  No calls to customer service needed.  I would buy from this vendor the next time I shop.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Great product, would be lost without it.  It basically replaces a laptop at a fraction of the cost and is really simple to us. Great seller as well, I had it the next day.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Pros
- The design is great. I love how thin this is compared to the first model. Not bulky at all and very easy to carry around. Also, it looks very sleek and modern.
- The battery life is wonderful. I use my iPad 2 for hours on end and by the end of the day, there is still more than 50% battery.
- Facetime is a great feature. My boyfriend and I Facetime daily and it's just like being there with him. Really cool and great for people who want to video chat with their family or friends.
- Great resolution. Nearly every app and feature of this device is crystal clear. Better than an HDTV.
- There are literally thousands of apps that one could download & lot of great free ones.
- Very fast internet that NEVER freezes or force closes. Even the most detailed, memory eating web pages will load in a couple of seconds.
- You could view many websites at once. With the iPad 2, you don't have to close your Yahoo! e-mail to access your Facebook. With this, you could open up several tabs to multitask.
- Fast touch keyboard that is large enough to not make mistakes. I take my college notes on this daily and it's fast enough and easy enough to keep up with even the fastest-speaking prof.
- Good memory space. I only got the 16GB and I'm very surprised at how much data it holds.

Cons
- The camera is ABSOLUTELY horrible. When I went to take my first picture, I couldn't help but notice the graininess of the camera. So, if you're looking to purchase this & do a TON of photography, I wouldn't recommend it. It's worse than a 1990s digital camera. Less than one megapixel.
- Sometimes the screen rotates without me flipping it. Not a huge deal but it could get annoying.

As you can see, the pros definitely outweigh the cons. Overall, it's a good device and a smart buy. You could practically use it anywhere and for nearly everything. Very glad that I purchased this."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This gadget is so addictive.  The one I received from Amazon.com was brand new, and came in as advertised.  I love it, use it every day and finding out new ways to use it.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Love my iPad so far.  I went back and forth on whether I should get the 3g I ended up getting only wifi, I haven't missed the 3g yet.  My son loves it to.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"How much do I love my iPad2?  Well, as I joke I tell to friends, my husband is threatening to name it the corespondent in our divorce suit. That's only a half joke.  I've had this wonderful piece of personal technology since shortly after it was released in April.  It goes absolutely everywhere with me.  I commute on the train to work, so I got the 3G version for connectivity when I am out of wifi range.  With AT&T, it is a reasonable $25 a month for 2 gigs of data transfer, and that is more than enough.  And I can turn the 3G plan on and off on a month-by-moth basis if I don't think I'll need it.

This thing is so much more than its specs.  Here's what I use it for:  My email, both personal and work; reading Kindle and iBooks; reading the NY Times in the train, as well as checking about half a dozen other news sites for the latest information; reading magazines in their full-color glory (I recommend Zinio); watching movies and TV (Netflix streaming, Hulu Plus, ABC, You Tube and more -  it's been a godsend since last week's hurricane, which lunched my living room TV); participating in discussion forums and blogs; checking Facebook; shopping, shopping, shopping; checking weather; getting maps and navigation; having video chats with friends; using Skype for landline calls when I was in Spain and couldn't use my iPhone; playing with jigsaw puzzles, my favorite time suck.  There's much, more more, but I'd be here all night.

I know that other Android-based tablets can do most of these things and can even do something's that iPad cannot.  But I love the look and feel of the iPad -  it feels very light in my hands, even with a leather cover.  And I love the incredible range of apps available from Apple.  Some Apple-haters would accuse me of ""drinking the Apple KoolAid"" and let them.  All I know is that this is the best piece of personal technology that has yet been invented."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"So, you're thinking of buying an iPad however, you're not so sure of what it can do and how it works. So, here is the ""Dummies Guide to the iPad"" to help you make that decision.

""I promise to keep the jargon down to a bare minimum"" :

To begin with the iPad must be paired to an existing Laptop or Desktop PC. These can be normal Microsoft Windows or Mac PC's. Once paired you can use the iPad by itself. It only has to be paired once. Although, there is a rumour that the next generation will work straight out of the box.

You will be able to:

-Touch and pinch the screen to type words and move things around
-Send and Receive Emails
-Browse the Internet including Online Banking, Internet Shopping and more...
-Listen to Music, including the Radio when there is a Wireless (Wi-Fi) connection
-Watch Videos and Movies
-Write and Print Letters (see the section on 'Printing' further down)
-Download and Play Games
-Become a Smarter Person (more on this later)
-Display Pictures - it is an electronic Picture Frame too!
-Take Pictures and Movies, if it has the onboard camera (iPad2 and newer)
-Have a chat with the relatives abroad using Video Conferencing technology
-Download THOUSANDS of books into a snazzy Book Reader that you can actually turn pages on the screen with
-There are loads more - I'll leave them as a surprise if you decide to buy one :)

You will NOT be able to:

-Watch a special type of animation or movie using a technology known as 'Flash' - don't worry about this though, you'll hear lots of people complaining about it. It really is no big deal and you'll learn to live without it. Over time, many of the popular web sites will move away from using Flash and use a newer technology that DOES work on iPads.
-Insert a CD (there is no slot and you don't actually need one)
-In fact, there is not much else you can't do with an iPad :

THE WIZARDS

No, not the ones' from Oz! Wizards are helpful programs that magically pop up and automatically configure things like the Internet and Email connections for you. The iPad has more Wizards than you can wave a wand at! When you first switch it on and whenever you need to set something up it will automatically present you with a Wizard. Therefore setting things up is as easy as 1-2-3.

The iPad is also an iPod!! - Loading music is done in one of two ways.

1 - install the free version of iTunes onto your normal PC and follow the Wizards instructions to download your music from the 'iTunes Store' or transfer your music from your favourite CD collection. Then, connect the iPad to your computer using the supplied cable and it will automatically 'Synchronise' your music to the iPad. Yup, you guessed it - using yet another Wizard!

2 - iTunes is a built in application (or App) on the iPad itself. Tap this App to search for and download your music directly to the iPad. You could even download a movie or your favourite episode of 24 too!

Once the music is on there just tap the iPod App to listen to it. Easy-Peasy!

APPS

The iPad extensively uses Apps. Apps are downloaded, using Wi-Fi. This is why you don't need a CD drive. These are the icons that are displayed on the screen.

Apps are downloaded from the Internet using yet another App called: ""The App Store"". Tap this icon to search for or see a list of the most popular Apps available, some are paid for and some are free! Tap the 'Install' button next to the one you'd like, follow the Wizards instructions and the App will automatically download and appear as a new icon on the screen.

LOADING PICTURES

These can be loaded onto the iPad using iTunes, Email or the 'Camera Connection Kit' - this is a separate adaptor ($30) that plugs into the bottom of the iPad. Just insert the memory card from your camera into the adaptor and it will automatically load the pictures into the built in Photo App.

THE PICTURE FRAME

When the iPad is locked (by pressing the button on the top-right side) and then back on again, you'll see a little icon in the lower right side corner of the display. Tap this and the Photo App will automatically display your pictures in full screen mode, converting the iPad into a digital Photo frame! It is a great feature. This means that you can leave the ipad on the shelf, literally as part of your rooms decor! You may want to purchase a 'Dock ($30)' to have the iPad tilted and supported at just the right angle.

Tip: if you need a reason to justify buying an iPad to your wife - use the Picture Frame one!!

PRINTING

Printing is done wirelessly, however you MUST use one of the wireless printers detailed on the apple.com website. Typically, it will not print to anything other than one of those printers. There is one caveat to this statement, it is possible to print to any wireless printer if you pay for and download a third party App that is available via the App Store - use the search keywords 'wireless printing' to find it.

It is also possible to email whatever you'd like to print and pick it up on your normal PC for printing.

Finally, I mentioned that you could become a Smarter Person by using an iPad - in fact this is not a joke. There are thousands of educational Apps including ones' for learning Astronomy through to learning how to read and play music and even Apps that will help you learn a new language. The possibilities are literally right at your finger tips!!

If you're unsure of which size to buy just buy the largest one you can afford. I have a 32GB version and have only used half of its capacity even with some very large Apps installed.

The iPad is many things to many people and the information above is just scratching the surface.

""I hope this review helps you make the right decision and I also hope that I did not use too much confusing jargon.""

Good luck!

*** update 12th October 2011 ***

Apple have released their new Operating System (iOS 5)

Amongst many new and enhanced features there is now the ability to synchronise data across multiple Devices. They call it 'iCloud' - think of iCloud as 'Virtual Filing Cabinet' to store your Documents, Diary and a record of your downloaded media from iTunes. Always accessible as long as there is an internet connection.

iCloud also allows the iPad to be used without having to 'Pair' it with a computer. It will now work straight out of the box!"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This is the best tablet or even a lap top I've ever had love it would highly recommend this to every one	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I'm a developer and Android fan who also happens to have and Android phone which I love. So I was looking for the same experience in a tablet, and mostly because of Android being open and the fact that I may be able to apply custom roms, etc. After researching a lot, months ago I found the Androids tablet to be superior, or so I thought, to the iPad. Thats because I compared the hardware specs, usb support, etc. So I bought an Archos tablet first and then a GTab. But to be honest, the experience was never fluid or at least not near to what I was used in my phone. The UI is very laggy and there are too many bugs still. After a while I couldn't stand it anymore and I sold them. I think the problem is the software, Android, which is evolving and is still not ready for primetime, though I do think it will be sometime given the currnt trend.

So I decided to give the iPad a try. And it was worth it. The experience of this product is amazing, everything is crisp and fluid, even with less hardware than the Android ones. There's just no way to compare the OS in this regard. The iPad offers the best experience for a tablet today. If you don't believe me go and try one for at least 30 mins. I know that Apple is closed and all of those things I also hate, but still, the experience of using this device is so amazing it outweights other purely inellectual aspects, at least for me it does.

If you want a tablet that is fluid, reliable and just works, buy the iPad. Even the iPad 1 will do. If you want to play with roms and don't mind the bugs and UI freezes and basically don't mind spending time debugging usability issues, buy and Android tablet for the nice things like USB integration and openess.

For now I'll stick to Android for phones and to Apple for tablets. Let's see what happens a year from now.

Hope this review helps."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I recently purchased an Apple Ipad2 32 GB as a birthday and anniversary present for my wife. Amazon was the best price on the web that I could find at that time, even cheaper than Walmart.
The Ipad2 arrived in about 5 days and since that time my wife has used it continuously even more than her desktop. Kinda makes a Desktop obsolete now."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Great, faster than expected, great graphics and the camera is better than expected.  Processor is much faster than first generation iPad.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The IPad is everything stated and so much more.  Allowing me to do common work-related items while traveling without having to use my laptop in airports is fabulous.  Just love it and finding that I am using the iPad more than my laptop.  Not a replacement for a laptop or PC! But enhances ones productivity.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I love it! It is the best tabloid on the market. It is worth every last penny. You can do so many things with it, I don't have enough time to explain how many things it can do. It almost becomes a friend to you . You will grow very attached to it! Of course it gets two thumbs up!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The new iPad 2 has become an invaluable extension of my office.  It's fast, has a great screen, and is easy to use.  With apps, I can rmeotely access my work desktop; access my company's entire lan, have all my files avialble to me onthe road via dropgox, have all my important Word, PDF, Excel, and Powerpoint files with me, call others using Yahoo, email on the fly, watch movies, listen to Spotify/iTunes, create a MindMap, create a presentation, take a picture and annotate it, annotate PDFs, edit Word, Excel files, find my way on a map, keep up with my blog, keep up and trade stocks, do unit conversions, request AAA roadside assistance, scan prices making drawings, and play games.  What is not to like!  IF you don't have one or you are skeptical, you have no idea what you're missing.  And more memory is better.  Also, having 3G is great for when you decide to turn it on while travelling.  Don't wait, just buy it now!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Great buy!!! Love the Ipad!!! I use it for work, at home!!!!I recommend it very much!!!And it is not expensive for what you can do with it!!!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I had been debating whether I wanted a Kindle or an I-pad. The Kindle is a terrific product, but I can do so much more with my I-pad that I am glad I spent the extra money.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I have difficulty with my arms, but my finger dexterity is still pretty good. There are so many features of the iPad 2 that make this one of the most indispensable devices in my life. Many of the apps are out-of-this-world amazing, while others simply allow you to be as productive as possible. When you consider the evolution of this product in such a short time, one can only wonder what the future holds. I'm excited and very optimistic!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I have never purchased anything electronic, I am totally old school.  Anyway, after contemplating on buying this or not, I went for it.  I can't tell you how happy I have been.  It is so convenient, easy to use, easy to buy apps and my kids absolutely love it.  they are 3 and 5 and think it's the best thing ever!  They want one for each of them.  They have spent more time on it playing games than I have used it since purchasing it.  I already have 38 kid game aps on it as well as many TV and movies.  it's great for the car.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The ipad 2 is awesome it has not broken once and i got it the day it came out it hasn't even had any problems. The resolution on it is amazing and the apps are unbelievable! I would recommend the ipad 2 too anyone it is a huge improvement to the first ipad.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	(Ipad 2 32gb wifi no 3G) Not much new here, the hype is right these are fantastic devices. I purchased to see if I could replace my laptop with the ipad for the things I most often do with the laptop (email & surfing)I just got the wifi version since I did not want another $20-30 month for a data plan for the Ipad, and besides everywhere I go I seem to have wifi access (home, hotels, coffee shops,etc..)  All initial aspects worked perfect, easy to set up email, networks, bluetooth.  battery life seems to be good and there are many free and low cost apps to make even more use of the ipad in work related functions.  There is a nice app for working with things like MS Word or Excel documents.  Its nothing short of amazing.  The only thing needed is they should add a SD card slot to the unit or a regular usb port.  I would just like an easer way to exchange data/pictures & other things.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	What can I say...Apple has got it going on! This is a great example of new technology. And thanks to Amazon...I was able to share this new techno with my wife! So...Thanks Amazon, and thanks to the vendors that you endorse.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	perfect transaction with quick shipping!  will use again.  iPad 2 is great!  love all the apps and ability to use for e-mails and Facebook, etc.  no 3G necessary with wifi almost everywhere.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Regarding the store, everything was more than OK. Really fast sipping. I really recomend it. Regarding the product, is unbelievable how you can use iPad 2 for business, enterteinement and D2D needs. I'm very satisfied with my recent aquisition.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	My iPad is really fun to work with, the only problem I had was that I had downloaded NOOK ebooks while I was in the US, but forgot to download the link that enables me to read them. As I live in Europe, I can't download that link. Also I find that there are certain apps that don't work in Europe.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I've postponed this review for a few months -- waiting to see how useful it would be after the newness wore off. So, the verdict is in:

I put it in a black leather case and deliver sermons from it every week (written on a Mac and transferred to the iPad by ""Print to PDF"" at A5 size straight to a Dropbox folder, then transferred on the iPad from Dropbox to iBooks. It takes about 20 seconds). I prefer the iPad to printed sermon notes and wedding outlines because it's more easily hand-holdable, I can use a custom color scheme at no extra charge for ink, the print can be very large, I'm not wasting a bunch of paper, it's lighter, smaller, and more portable than a large-print Bible, and when talking to people after church I've got access to my calendar and address book so I can schedule appointments, get contact information, write reminders for that week's staff meeting, etc., -- all while standing in the foyer greeting members and visitors.

I've also used it for presentations by connecting it to a vga projector input at the podium and utilizing the mirrored display. You aren't limited to Keynote for that although it does work well. But I've found it just as useful with iBooks, Bible software, and even YouTube player. The portability is fantastic -- disconnect the video adapter, slap the cover closed and walk away.

Daily uses: mileage and expense tracking, keeping track of contacts, calendars & notes, video record-keeping, listening to Texas Rangers baseball broadcasts, web surfing, investment management, reading papers and books, and navigation. It's my favorite device for reading and responding to most emails.

It can stand in for a computer in a pinch, which it had to recently when my laptop was put out of commission for a few days by a lightning strike. Using various apps most of the data I need on a daily basis is automatically synced wirelessly between the iPad, iPhone, and MBAir, so I still had my complete calendar and all my appointments (iCal/Google combo), access to all my email (IMAP gmail), all my notes (Evernote), vital documents (Dropbox), and the ability to research and write sermons, articles, and class presentations. It's capable enough that I can get by with leaving my laptop at the office most evenings. Yea!

It's far more portable than even my MacBook Air. It's small and discrete enough to take into restaurants, tuck into the console in my car, and take into hospital waiting rooms without appearing insensitive to anxious family members. Instant on and off means you can pick it up to glance at the weather radar, or check an address, or take a note as easily as picking up an iPhone, but the size makes it much faster and easier to enter and view information. It's also large enough to share information with others around you.

I use it daily and would replace it within a week if I lost it. 5 stars."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I purchased this Ipad2 for my daughter's birthday she is in love with it, she is starting college on Sept and that was the idea. There are so many things she can do with it. The purchase was smooth and the delivery was perfect.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"No only is this am AMAZING product.  But Apple is the best company I have ever bought anything from.  We now have a saying in our house if you want a product and apple sells one, don't think just buy the apple.

This has so many uses the 64G is well worth it.

You definitely want the 3G version because it has GPS.

My first version died because I dropped it in water.  Apple felt sorry for me and gave me a new one!  wow!  My mothers phone broke they handed her a new one.  My friend dropped his on the ground and broke the screen.  They gave him a new one.

I LOVE APPLE!!!!"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	No complaints here! My iPad was delivered quickly and in perfect condition. Although I did have to reset it to get the iPad to sync to my PC iTunes, I have had no difficulties since.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I bought the IPAD2 with gift cards I nabbed from work and I am so glad I did (its a joke people, don't get bent out of shape)!  The Ipad2 is great fun and I can't believe I was doing half the crap I was doing with my iphone on such a small screen now that I have the 7in ipad screen.  I do bills with ""pageonce"", I read magazines with ""zinio"", I read books with the ""nook"" app, I listen to radio (Bubba the Love Sponge) with ""tunein radio"" and I have phone sex using ""facetime"".  It has everything I need for a full and healthy life and if you have the means, I highly recommend picking one up."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Apple products continue to amaze me by their simplicity, ingenious design and quality.  Sure this one may not be the one with the most options, but it surely is one of the most attractive and functional platforms for the general population.  What it does, for what it's meant to do, it does outstandingly.  It is probably by these reasons it is so popular and has so much competition at the same time.

This is the comparison table from my point of view. I hope it helps:

PROs:
1) Its simple and intuitive interface.  Nothing else is simpler to use.  It is ""kid-and-grandma's friendly"".
2) Its responsiveness.  I have yet to interacted with a touch device that reacts to input this quickly.
3) Its weight, very lightweight for its size.
4) Availability of applications.

CONs:
1) Memory management.  With multitasking, it may sometimes be difficult to clearly identify what processes are running and how much memory is being used.  This may be a problem for some people.
2) Screen resolution.  It is good, but definitely has room for improvement.
3) Sound speaker at the back.  It would be so nice to have a speaker at the front, like the camera. You are very ingenious guys, let's make it happen.  It would improve sound so much by not being muffled by the hands, the cover, etc."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I am more than satisfied with my recent purchase of an Apple iPad2.  It's everything I expected and more.  It is much easier to carry around the house and elsewhere than was our laptop.  And with the Portenzo case I bought for it, it looks good setting on our coffee table.  It's fun just downloading and testing the many applications available.  This is a must have.

B0013FRNKG	I absolutely love my ipad2!  I had debated for months about getting one. I was afraid I would be wasting my money.  After having it actually in my hands, it's one of the best purcjases I've made!  I use it all the time as an ereader, computer, ipod, playing games, etc. The.ipad2 is definitely worth the money!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I absolutly LOVE my IPad 2 I can't really think of anything that's wrong with it, besides not being able to have Flash- but you can pretty much get an app for anything like that! I also bought the Smart Cover, very useful-I always have it on! However it doens't cover the back-I just ordered a few days ago the SmartSleeve from BoxWave, I have heard that it is a good buy, I would suggest something like that! The camera works very well, I am helping my sister plan her whole wedding through our IPads. I bought mine thorugh WalMart, but you never-the-less Apple products are very trustworthy~I didn't even get coverage. Very good product, and would strongly suggest it for anybody that is on-the-go, has kids, my grandparents use it sometimes also! It's great for work too!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Wonderful piece of electronics equipment.  Worked right out of the box, which arrived on time and in perfect condition.  I've installed several apps, and they all work!  I just installed the Skype app for the iPad2, and that works just fine, and I Skype with my children.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I cannot express how much I love my iPad! It is great for many different reasons, I could write this review all day. If you purchase, you will not be disappointed, it is well worth the money.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"When choosing which capacity iPad to buy, you should be aware of the following:

For many users, this 16GB iPad will be a great choice because, although you cannot expand its capacity, you can import files ""on-the-go"" with the following Apple accessory: the Apple Camera Connection Kit

You can use the Apple Camera Connection Kit (the SD card reader part) to import media files directly into your iPad, without the need to sync to iTunes.

This means you can bring along with you an almost unlimited number of media files, such as movies, mp3's, and photos.

Perfect for a long trip, etc. Why not take along 100 GB or more? Fantastic!

There are a few details you need to know to import media files this way.

1). Create a folder on any SD card and name that folder ""DCIM"".

2). Place media files into the DCIM folder.

3). Important: The media file names have to be exactly 8 characters long (no more, no less), or the iPad will not see them.

Examples: 8letters.mp3, 8numbers.jpg, 8Numbers.mp4, TheBirds.mp4, Img_9001.bmp.

Those are really the main details, but here are a few more:

When you insert the Card Reader (one of two devices in the kit) into the iPad, with an SD card in it, in a moment the iPad screen will show thumbnails of all the media files on the card.

You can import some or all into the iPad. You cannot play media files from the card, you must first import them. To select some media files, just touch them to highlight them and choose ""Import"". Or, you can select ""Import All"".

The iPad will ask if you want to Keep or Delete (on the card). Be careful to select Keep (in most cases).

Valid video files need to be in the "".MP4"" format, version H.264. Or convert them to that format using almost any conversion program. I chose a size of 640 x 480, and it was perfect for filling up the screen.

NOTE: the media files are imported into the ""Photo"" section of your iPad. Even the MP3's and Videos. So, to watch a movie, for example, select the Photo icon, not the Video icon on your screen (it won't be in the Video section).

AND, you can delete any media files after playing them. That way, you can, for example, load a movie or two into the iPad, watch, then delete to make room for others."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The new Ipad 2011 is AWESOME. I own both the first Ipad and this new one, and Apple went beyond my expectations on this second one. One of the reasons I love Apple products, whether it be the Iphone or the Ipad, is because of the apps. The new Ipad apps are AWESOME! Also the new Ipad games are pretty cool, also. The new Ipad 2011 still has a few minor issues but absolutely nothing to be concerned with. The new Ipad is so far above and beyond any other tablet out. One of the other cool things about the Ipad 2 is that it is similar to a regular laptop computer when it comes to updates. The new Ipad updates are sent to the tablet automatically, but you can also go online and get additional updates. The new Ipad 2011 also offers some sleek new designs in its covers. Very think and hardly noticable. I would strongly recommend the Ipad 2 over any other tablet on the market. The new Ipad 2011 is a winner in my book!!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	i may be biased since i like most of the products that apple produces but i really like my ipad 2.  Its thin design, and ability to play things like hulu, netflix, mlbtv and more along with apps that let me stream videos from my HUGE desktop computer to my ipad are great!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Using this devices It's really simple, fast and exciting, thats why searching the web, listening to music, reading papers and others make the ipad fantastic for it. Apps are extremelly cool, I completly recommend it	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"This thing is incredible.  It's got great games and is better for quickly checking my email, and filing it, than my desktop computer.  It took about five minutes to transfer my address book from my Palm to my iPad, including looking up instructions.  The email client and address book are integrated, so I can easily update email addresses in the address book.  It's sleek and smooth and nice to touch.

I had a little trouble figuring out iTunes to start with (because I was trying to download Plants vs. Zombies before completing the OS update and other setup tasks).  I still haven't figured out how to force synch.  And it bugs me that everything goes through iTunes -- I want to be able to drag and drop files to it from my computer.

The default keyboard utility is useless for any kind of coding -- I've ordered the ZAGGmate keyboard case.

To summarize:  this is a giant lump of awesome that comes with some minor irritations."	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"ok. so this is actually my second tablet review. my previous one was for the Motorola Xoom tablet that i chose over the iPad 2.

i reviewed the Xoom and i stick to that review...it is indeed a great machine, but in about a week it started running slow and locking up on me. nothing too hardcore, but enough to make me think that, for the price, it should be better.

i went back to best buy and picked up the iPad 2 which i had previously passed on and judged unfairly...in short, i was intimidated. PC's all my life and i knew nothing about apple products except that they were expensive and the most pretentious people liked them. and i stand by that.

well.....lets just say that the iPad 2 is just a amazing little machine. it took me awhile to figure out the whole system...it is different from a PC and not google-based. it is a transition...

if your like me i can tell you honestly its a transition you would do well for yourself by taking.

i am gonna compare the Xoom to the iPad 2 because it might be helpful and when i made my purchase i noticed alot of reviewers did the same...

1- looks. iPad.its stunning. absolutely gorgeous. its art. no doubt. the Xoom is cool indeed, but the iPad has it hands down. don't mind paying more for that at all. you live once.

2- speed. its incredibly fast. insane. and gotta give it up to the Xoom too...when it was running at full speed it was incredible too. both equal in my opinion.

3- ease of use. Xoom has it all over the iPad 2. coming from PC's its a seamless transfer. google-based. tabs. etc...no worries. the iPad is completely new so the challenge is teaching yourself...BUT once you learn the way...MY GOD IT IS AWESOME.

4- accessories and apps. iPad. all the way. no doubt. none. the apps are incredible. the accessories are ridiculously expensive for what they are but once you hold them...the quality is there. the Xoom has no real acessories to speak of..and the apps available are few and far between. that said...i didn't have any problem with normal use of the Xoom and i understand more are on the way...which is awesome.

5- battery life. same. both rock. ten hours.

6- screen. iPad 2. hands down. amazing and beautiful. the screen doesn't get nearly the amount of fingerprints as the xoom and the pictures are gorgeous. this is a non-issue. the iPad looks better in every way.

7- ease of use. Xoom. really easy to use. intuitive.

8- support. iPad. AppleCare is the best thing ever. ever. forget about it.

9- photos. Xoom. the ability to store photos into catagories and switch them around is awesome. the iPad you just have one big place to put all of your pics.

that said 10- cameras. iPad.

11 - cost. about the same. iPad maybe more with the applecare.

and finally...

12- set up. Xoom. all the way. plug it up and your good to go. the iPad you gotta sync with a PC and load up iTunes and jump a bunch of annoying hoops. that done though...MAN is it awesome.

sooo....its a big purchase. i think both machines will do right by anyone. but if your looking for something artistic. dramatic. tough and secure go for the iPad. if your looking for something familar, comfortable and easy...the Xoom is for you.

in conclusion....my iPad 2 is awesome. im glad i took the plunge and have no regrets. every day im loving it more and more...its amazing.

im becoming pretentious now. i find myself silently judging others by their tablets and computers. i do and its awful. if you choose to get a iPad you will do the same thing. you need to be prepared for it....

its a glorious feeling!!!!! IT IS AND I'M NOT GONNA LIE!!!

best."	5	electronics

Very user friendly and not like a notebook it
is very portable and convenient.
I use it everyday for research or just fun."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The IPAD2 is an incredibly lightweight, capable tablet that is very easy to use.  Just getting used to not having to use a mouse is incredible, and the weight saved versus carrying a laptop or even a netbook is awesome.  I travel alot, so this makes a big difference to me.  In addition, the ease with which it was purchased on Amazon versus trying to find one at a store, due to the short supply, was simply wonderful.  It arrived within 4 days, at a better price than in the stores.  All in all, a great purchase with which I am very satisfied.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I really do enjoy the iPad 2 it has an amazing display and it is super fast. Very lightweight and sleek design.the cameras work extremely well in the light, in the dark it seems to be fuzzy. The other day there was a problem with the volume rocker and Apple did a very good job at helping me fix it. Now it works with ease. The battery is very very good it lasts 10+ hours sometimes if I use it correctly it will last days. This is the best tablet on the market. I'm actually writing the review on it now which brings me to the keyboard. It is very responsive and comfortable to type on. At first it is hard to type but once you get use to it you will type pretty fast. In fact I'm better at typing on this than on the computer. It is just so much easier.if you get this you will agree. The bad reviews are wrong. Those reviews were probably written by the companies with other tablets just trying to bring their tablet to the top and Apple's to the ground but it will NEVER HAPPEN. Apple is the best brand of technology out their. Don't hesitate to buy. They go very quick. Apple even shipped it quicker than 1 week. Than I got it in 1 week. Although I had to wait it was well worth it. I originally went with the xoom but it was to slow and was delayed. Plus the iOS software is just plain better and much simpler. The Apple iPad 2 is great for all people, chefs, business men and women, teachers,or even the stay at home mom. Always fun.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"My husband talked me into buying an ipad2 after listening to one too many complaints about my Droid phone. So I dumped the ""smart"" phone, reverted back to a ""dumb"" phone and got an ipad. I just love it! It's small and light - fits in most of my purses without a problem. I carry it around all the time - has my grocery list, my address book, photos of my grandchildren, my calendar, my favorite music, maps & GPS and links to my ebay auctions. It has Angry Birds to keep me amused while waiting at the doctor's offce. It has Pandora radio, which is AWESOME! It has a screen I can actually SEE and a keyboard I can actually USE! No more struggling trying to do things on that stupid ""smart"" phone. AND it never calls anyone by accident like the Droid used to do. A lot...

I have a laptop at home for my business use, so I didn't expect it to be a substitute for that. But when I am shopping on ebay, it's much more pleasant to sit on the couch with my little ipad than to sit at the desk with the laptop.

I find it works seamlessly with wi-fi and Verizon wireless. I got the $20/month 1 gig plan and it's plenty for me. I bought a docking station with speakers, so my stereo just became completely obsolete. The battery life is outstanding - especially when compared to my laptop.

The only thing I am not wild about is the Itunes interface. It has taken me quite a bit of fussing to master the art of getting stuff transferred over to the ipad. But I've got it down pat now - thanks to a little extra help from an Apple customer support rep.

In short - you can have my ipad ""when you pry it from my cold, dead fingers""."	5	electronics

I can say this is extremely fast and the screen is brilliant, vivid and bright. The size and speed of this unit are truly remarkable. It outperforms every laptop I have used from HP, Dell, Sony, and Panasonic. Given the apps for the iPad2, it appears that most office functions are becoming available for Apple. As soon as my company IT group can support it, I will happily carry the iPad2 for work travel."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I'm your average, everyday consumer who doesn't know a lot about computers and electronics, but I know enough to get by. The IPad is awesome.

I'm so glad I didn't settle on a Kindle.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	At first I was a bit hesitant about purchasing the ipad. When the first generation came out I had no interest what-so-ever. It wasn't untill a cople of weeks ago I did some heavy research on tablet pc'. Comparing different models ect. What made me ultimately get the ipad was all the reviews I read on it vs the play book, and the samsung galaxey tablet. I really find that I use it every day, and that was one of my biggest concerns. I play games on it, have a bunch of books I love on there,  as well as music, besides web surfing, I use it as a personal journal. I don't regret my purchase and it was worth every cent. However I don't recommend.buying the smart cover. It doesn't give enough coverage, instead I purchased a product from hear called roo case and I love it! I also got a anti-glear screen protector. I highley recommended this product.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Ipad in so many ways is better than many tablets in the market but all of them are junk compare to the Ipad and ipad 2, and now with the slim like upgrade its comfort is twice and multitasking ability has been tripled by the A5 chip witch has made it and imbinsible product on the market. I will recomend to buy the ipad in apple store and buy the apple 1 year day care. or any close store like wallmart target ECT...	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I love the iPad2.  It provides many hours of enjoyment.  The battery lasts longer than predicted, which is a nice plus.  I was able to set it up initially with very little problem.  The sound provided is much crisper than I expected.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Intro: I've always been a fan of Android and prefer it to iOS, but I must admit that at the moment, Apple has the best tablet on the market. After trying to decide between the Galaxy Tab 10.1 and iPad 2, I pulled the trigger on the iPad 2 (16GB, Wi-Fi, Black) and have yet to regret my decision.

Pros:
*Apps - The best feature about the iPad is the App Store, and this was the deciding factor for me. On a smartphone, there's a bit more to consider than apps (call quality, carrier, camera quality-in my opinion, pointless on a tablet-,etc.), but on a tablet, it's all about the functionality delivered through tablet-optimized apps.
*Design - The iPad 2 is very thin, light, and has a nice aluminum finish on the back. The only comparably sized tablet is the Galaxy Tab 10.1.
*Screen - The screen is great, especially in terms of quality and contrast. It's a 9.7"" IPS screen with a 1024x768 resolution.
*Battery life - Excellent. It has the best battery life of tablets (Galaxy Tab 10.1 comes close). To get an idea, it lasts for days with some gaming/web browsing each day.
*Accessories - Because the iPad is basically the epitome/name-brand of tablets at the moment, if there's a tablet accessory, it's compatible with the iPad.
*Resale value - If I decide to sell it later to upgrade to the inevitable iPad 3, I know it will maintain most of its value.

Cons:
*Cameras - Although I will probably never use them, the cameras on the iPad 2 are horrible.
*Screen - Competitor tablets have a bigger 10.1"" screen, but my biggest complaint is the lower resolution of the iPad (1024x768 vs 1280x800). The resolution difference is more important because it would've allowed for more content to be displayed which is espeically important for web browsing.
*Apple's proprietary ports - The non-standard ports lead to some overpriced adapters and accessories.
*Apple's ""walled garden"" aka iTunes - To most people this isn't a big deal, but some people will be annoyed about having to use iTunes. Personally, I don't mind iTunes, but I hate only having Apple-approved apps available in the App Store. Luckily, for those who care, like me, you can just jailbreak your device."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The Ultimate tablet computer.  It has no equal in the market.  The Apps available are endless.  Surfing the Web, checking emails and holding an ibooks bookshelf full of technical PDF documents make the iPad 2 the most useful tool.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I absolutely love the Ipad 2.  I bought it for my mom and she also loves it.  It is great for surfing the internet and reading books.  Also it is very easy to use.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I had the earlier I Pad 2 but without the 3 g. The performance with the 3 g connectivity is outstanding and worth the sdditional cost.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Except for my iPod - probably my favorite device of all time - I'd never had an Apple product before now, and I really like the 32GB, Wifi iPad2. It does exactly what's claimed for it and more. It's lightweight, easy to handle, and easy to use. As for the smart cover, it's probably the best product innovation in several years by any device maker. The access to the large and rapidly increasing # of apps, of course, puts it in a class far removed from everything else in its category. I like it so much, in fact, that when my Dell laptop died a couple of weeks ago, I bought a MacBook, that - so far at least - seems equally intuitive and pleasant to use.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"In a few words... is just amaizing how Apple develop this great product and you have a whole world of APPS for every task.
Is just a great... you must have one..!"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Bought this as a gift for my Dad with my Mom. For a Grampa he really is tech savy and takes time to learn all he can about the new ""gadgets"" on the market.  We were both blown away by the Apple IPAD 2 AT&T.  Phone and computer all rolled up into one.  Extremely easy to use. Very fast and the picture is incredible.  Loading apps was a breezy and the available accessories were endless.  Dad is very happy with the gift and it has become part of his everyday life.  Now I want one!!"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"My family is just getting to know the iPad2, but so far we love it.  It has many features we have yet to discover, but have found it useful for educational apps for our children and functional apps for our home.  It can definitely calm a bored 5 year old if you have a long wait.  That is almost worth the price.

Due to shortage of WiFi units, we had to pay the extra $130 for a 3G model.  While we did not like having to pay the premium, it was better than the very long wait."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"The main reason I purchased an iPad 2 was to be an ebook reader. The iPad supports kindle iBook
coursesmart and PDFs so I can easily find any textbook I need. The screen is great for reading in dark and well lighted areas and the text unless very small is easy to read. The OS is amazing and will only get better with ios 5 the apps such as evernote make the iPad the perfect notebook to read notes on etc. Battery life is incredible I can easily go 3-4 days without needing a recharge however I get 10-12 hours with constant use. If you truly want to use the iPad to it's full potential I recommend getting a smart cover it doesn't interfear with docks and cleans the screen as well as works as a great stand. The only downside I can think of is the keyboard it's awkward to use at times and can make you want to shorten or leave out words to type faster (using iPad now). I highly recommend getting an MacBook air and iMac if you can afford it. Using several computer setups I have never found a setup that just works like these 3 put together.

UPDATE: iOS 5 brings many more features students will love such a document sharing and iCloud backup over wifi after a full quarter using this device I have had zero issues and my battery still gets around ten hours of actual use before dying on me."	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"I have a habit of reading books, newspapers, magazines, etc. in bed. This habit is like the sleeping pill which puts me into sleep after 10 - 20 min reading/watching. iPad2 eliminated the needs of the paper version and I can hold it with just one hand.
The battery can last two weeks if I use it for this purpose and put it into sleep mode after reading without turning it off.
According to the user's guide, the battery is designed to recharge 1000 times and still retains 80% the original power, so the battery is really long lasting."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"First off, I don't know if Amazon claims to have the BEST prices, but if you buy your iPad from Apple.com you are getting a MUCH better deal. Plus right now they are engraving it for free. iPad 2 - 16 for 499.00, w/ 3G 629.00. You can even go to Walmart and get it for that price. I also thought that ALL iPads had to be sold at the same price - I could be wrong here, because I heard that through a friend. I don't know how long of a wait shipping is here, but as of this writing, my delivery date would be July 22-24.

So, if you don't mind the wait and you want the best deal for your iPad 2, Apple is the best bet. Or play it by ear and hope Walmart has one in stock and get it the same day.

PS. My 5 stars rates the actual iPad itself. It's a great tool and I absolutely love it. Goes anywhere and the fact I can FaceTime with friends across state/ country is totally Star Trek, (I mean, this man totally knew what was coming. In the 60's, can you imagine.)I originally bought the 32GB with wi-fi only. Figured since you are not bound by a contract, (ie. 2 years to subscribe) I would get the 3G just in case I ever wanted that feature. You cannot upgrade. If I were to go on a trip, I could subscribe to 3G for a month and then cancel. THAT is AWESOME."	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"For years I had carried around a Newton Messagepad 2100; which was the most amazing portable touch screen device until the iPhone dropped in on the scene. But still the iPhone didn't really carry along the legacy of a useful, tablet computer that the Newton had hinted at back in 1997.

As soon as I took my new iPad out of the box, I got the picture that there is something to this device that is more than a sum of its parts. After a few months; I keep saying this is the new personal computer. It will be laptops and desktops for work, and devices like the iPad for the rest of life. As it is, the iPad is almost that device - Its much more than I expected.

I have zero gripes with the hardware. None. Its the most perfect piece of hardware I've ever used. The battery lasts forever, the screen is amazing (amazing!) - the smart cover is genius.

Now that tethering with my iPhone works over bluetooth, portable internet is handled. Netflix, even facetime on the go is seamless.

ANyhow I could go on. Its no replacement for a ""computer"" but does everything else right.

I forgive you, Steve Jobs, for killing the Newton.

Newton is dead. Long live iPad."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"By now there are plenty of reviews that offer the pros and cons of the iPad 2 versus other tablets on the market.  With that in mind, I've decided to focus this particular review only for those of you who are in the same boat as me - which is debating whether or not to upgrade to an iPad 2 from the first gen iPad.

After giving it much thought, I recently took the plunge and I am 100% sure that I made the right decision.  However, this is only in the context of how I use the tablet, which is primarily for gaming and other graphic intensive apps.  Previously I owned the AT&T 3G iPad with 32GB of memory.  After giving it much thought, I decided to purchase the wi-fi only 64GB iPad 2, since I realized I don't actually used the 3G much.

Most of the apps I use are very graphic intensive.  EA games such as Dead Space, FIFA 11 ... or Gameloft games such as Order & Chaos, Starfront, and Dungeon Hunter ... I play those games often and noticed a HUGE difference after I transferred my data to the iPad 2.  The games run much better, and there is a major change in terms of performance.  There is much less slowdown, and FIFA 11 actually plays like the way it should - fast and crisp (and not slow and turgid, like it was when I was playing the exact same game on the first gen iPad).  In cases like this - having the faster processor and added RAM makes a huge difference.

Now if you're the kind of person who plays simpler, less graphic intensive games like Angry Birds, Diner Dash or World of Goo, you will probably not notice anything different.  You also won't really notice any difference if you stream or purchase videos as the display is the same as before.  Sorry, but no retina display this time around.

But what you will be pleased with is the fact the iPad 2 is far lighter than it's predecessor.  This is important for those of you who spend a lot on the iPad playing games (like me).  It was no secret that the previous iPad was bulky and difficult to hold.  It also made it very tiring to grab the device for an extended period of time (making it difficult to play intense FPS or sports game without frequent rest periods).  The iPad 2's weight makes it much easier to hold and less burdensome to play games for a long time.  Long story short, my hands don't feel numb as often as I did when I used the old iPad.

As for the other bells and whistles such as the camera/face time, etc ... all of that is well and good.  The interface is easy to figure out, so there isn't much brain surgery involved.  The smart cover is also a nice touch, though it's not a necessity.  I personally have one though, and I like it very much.

So the biggest question here is - should you upgrade to iPad 2 if you already own one?  If you are a die hard gamer, the answer is 100% absolutely yes.  The difference in performance is absolutely striking and you will see the benefits of upgrading within seconds (so long as you play games that take advantage of the upgrade - i.e. games w/high production value).

Even the apps I run outside of games run noticeably smoother and faster.  Using video/graphic intensive apps like CNN or ESPN XL is a snap, and they run much faster than on my previous iPad.

In short, should you upgrade from the iPad to the iPad 2?

1. If you play hardcore, graphic-intensive games - YES, upgrade ASAP

2. If you run a lot of apps at the same time, like to use video/graphic intensive apps - YES, upgrade

3. If you run apps that aren't that taxing (lighthearted games like Angry Birds, simple interface apps), or use the ipad to mostly surf, write email, etc - NO, upgrading is not necessary unless you have cash to spare (save your $$ for the iPad after the iPad 2 IMO).

That's my 2 cents for folks on the fence.  Good luck!"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I've hesitated in buying an iPad for quite a while because I had another device, but when two of my associates purchased the iPad2 I started shopping around and found that amazon.com had the best price. I started using it as a ""test"" to see if it would meet my needs and soon found out I could do everything I needed right from my iPad, like I'm doing right now. For me, it's a mini- workstation, I can literally run my business from my iPad2 now, it's perfect for when I'm on the road, with the apps you can get for it there's nothing I can't do, it's great!"	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	Visually stunning, endlessly useful, and easy to use: The iPad 2. Having owned both the original and iPad 2, I can say that this one is better. The long battery life, multitouch, and user friendly format make laptops seem clunky and archaic. Honestly, the only reasons I even tote out the laptop anymore is to view things in flash (though not the huge issue it is made out to be), and to type long papers. I prefer email, calendar, youtube, online shopping, listening to music and watching video and much more on the iPad. Worth the investment. No joke.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"Ipad 2 is so much more than just a ""big iPod touch"". People making such claims obviously do not own one.
I agree that because applications are similar and they both share the same iOS, the experience might not seem that different, but once you get your hands on it, the bigger screen, the dual core processor, larger memory and longer battery result in much much better overall experience.

It's more practical for almost everything, except of course portability as your iPod touch fits in your pocket but leaving that aside, it's really portable, you can take it with you everywhere.
This product has literally helped me get over my Ex."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The IPad 2 is great. The battery will last me days without charging even under continuous use. I took it to a memorial weekend party at the beach where we had 10 friends all staying in one house. Ends up I was the only person who brought a computer and it was my IPad. I never charged it and it lasted all weekend. Also the 3G is great, very fast, in fact usually faster than WiFi.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I bought the original iPad on ""day 1"", and have really enjoyed it for over a year now. When iPad 2 came out, I thought it was a nice evolutionary step, but not enough for me to upgrade.

However, the seemingly small changes do turn out to make a difference.  For example, one of my favorite uses of the original iPad was to read various newspapers and blogs while having breakfast. That worked pretty well, but the limited memory of the original iPad caused web-pages to rarely be cached: Following a link and then hitting the ""back"" button felt a bit sluggish. With iPad 2, this scenario works a lot better. Similarly, FaceTime and video Skype support were attractive to me, but I figured that having an iPhone 4 already would largely mitigate the advantage of having the feature also on iPad.  Well, the larger size of iPad 2 makes it much more natural to have my daughter join alongside of me in a conversation with overseas family members. The small weight and dimension differences also have a disproportional effect. My kids use a drawing app that also seems to benefit from the added hardware capabilities (memory-bound, I think) and GarageBand is even more impressive on iPad 2 than its already remarkable power on my original iPad.

I had a chance to try some other tablets (Xoom, 7"" Samsung, and Nook color), but at this time they're far behind iPad in just about every respect (the Nook color's low weight is nice though). The Xoom's screen has odd dimension when web-browsing or reading (it's nice when watching certain movies, but the experience improvement is small compared to the the reduced experience for most other applications, including non-wide-format videos). The smaller Samsung device indeed feels quite small, and, like the Xoom, it's missing nice applications in just about every major category.  Nook color is the least of all these alternatives, but perhaps the most attractive considering its lower price and light weight."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Even though I've discovered I'm not a fan of the iPad (or touch-screen devices that are any larger than the pocket-sized iPod), the iPad 1 has definitely been the most popular item in our household when the grand-kids visit, and my wife's minimal use of it in the classroom has led her to acquiring this iPad 2 model (though even since then she's found a computer-tablet that's much smoother, more responsive and precise in accepting and projecting the extra-fine details of mathematical equations and geometric symmetry. The iPad's various styli, with their resistant, rubbery ""nubs,"" still leave much to be desired).  Yet, overall there would appear to be few if any viable alternatives at this stage.  Apple was first to the parade and, according to practically every review of the latest model (including that most popular consumer's magazine), continues to remain in the top position.

The primary advantage of the Apple 2--from my perspective--would appear to be the lighter weight and more compact size.  Personally, I found the iPad 1 to be hot and heavy compared to my Air 11"", which I now use for practically all of my computing.  So be sure to take note of screen size and overall weight of any other device you may be considering before ordering.  Also, note that the highest-rated tablet on Amazon (the Toshiba) has yet to be released!  If you're considering it, it would seem overly hasty if not reckless not to wait for it to ""test out"" on the market for a few months.

As for the iPad, the Flash controversy proved a non-issue for my wife and me.  The lack of certain ports--for HDMI, USB, display, etc.--was never anything that couldn't be addressed and fixed with a readily available adapter.  Finally, look for any other machine that comes close to the iPad in terms of the galaxy of available ""apps.""  The lack of a keyboard (true of most any tablet) can also be addressed--but now we're getting close to a Macbook Air, which strikes me as the more practical purchase in the first place.

In short, there's every reason to spring for another iPad (if you like the concept in the first place) and a number of reasons to withhold purchase of any other brand.  But a caveat: this is one of the few times that I've found a product sold through Amazon to be significantly higher in cost, even without sales tax, than the same product purchased through Apple Store.

[As a musician, I've found a reason to like this device: it can be loaded up with musical scores (several life-times' worth) and set on a stand or piano ledger, the equivalent of a giant-sized cabinet full of notated music contained within a thin, easily readable and navigable tablet.]"	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"bought a 16gb ipad2 with 3G service from at&t which comes with a sim card slot.  you go to settings and input credit card info and sign up for a plan, it's that easy and convenient.  the plan you choose will auto-renew every month unless you cancel.  so it's pay-as-you-go as i was told/hoping.  your gb don't carry over so use it all before the month ends.  that shouldn't be a problem cause their 2gb for $25 plan(that's their maximum option) goes by fast(verizon has more plans with more gb options).

but checking how much is left in your plan is a cinch too: settings, view account in cellular data.  it keeps track by mb, and believe me you should check now and then.  before i turn my ipad 2 off i turn the cellular data off.  i turn both on again and check my plan and i seem to lose a lot of mb for just checking my plans' status.  i quess it costs alot to check, because it's not like a cell carrier to rip off the consumer right?  so i'll just shut my trap and not question the cellular overlords.

as for the ipad 2:

+  i really like the novelty of taking pics/vids using a 10"" screen.  if you miss a shot with a 10"" screen, you know it's your fault.  wish it had more photo-booth options/customizations though.
+  youtube and internet browsing is great, nay, apple-tastic on this thing.  smooth, fast, reliable, looks great.
+  i have a windows laptop for work-related stuff so i mainly use this when i want to relax and browse or play with apps.  great for that type of stuff.
+  not as heavy or slippery as ipad 1.  when you accidentally let it slip onto your face holding it up while lying down it kinda hurts(only happened twice).

-  not a fan of syncing and downloading itunes(amazon fan myself...free plug, you're welcome).  but i think the ipad 2 is a great device and i can put up with it(if it was buggy and crappy no one would put up with it)
-  kinda pricey and you got to buy extra stuff to put pics on it or hook it to your tv.
-  did i mention syncing and itunes?

glad i bought one and would recommend one, especially to new-comers to tablets.  because despite the ""who needs instruction manuals?"" attitude, it's probably the easiest electronic-related item you can figure out that costs hundreds of dollars.  btw, something every reviewer has failed to mention...it comes with 2 apple decals(!), which is about the same size as the instruction 'pamphlet'.  if those android tablets have decals, i'm there."	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	The Ipad 2 works great.  Just want to fore warn you that if you order this and they ship it FED X, be sure to check the tracking on the Fed X page.  It will probably tell you that a signature is required.  I did not check and the driver would not leave it at the door.  I had to be home to sign for it and they would not tell me what time they would be there.  Just be prepared.  I informed Amazon hoping they would add the Signature required in their tracking info.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I have the 64GB with AT&T 3G.  I absolutely love my iPad.  It does everything and i've been impressed with it in the 2 months that i've owned it so far.  I use it primarily as my internet browser, an e-reader, and to stream Netflix.  It's a revolutionary  product for me.  The iPad has replaced my laptop as my go-to for internet.  I no longer take my laptop with me on business trips.  The iPad does everything I need.  It doesn't replace the need for a computer, but it does allow me to travel without my laptop and to leave the laptop in the office (or the kitchen where it usually lives) when I want internet access on the couch.

Here are some of the key features that I use:

The web browser is the real deal.  It's full internet and not a mobile browser.  I like surfing the web on my iPad better than on my computer because the touch screen and gestures are very intuitive.

Facetime and Skype look great and are easy to use with the dual cameras.  It's nice to be on the road and be able to see my daughter any time I have an internet connection (Facetime requires WiFi, but you can Skype on the 3G).

As an e-reader, I haven't used it to read a full book yet, but I do often use iBooks to crunch PDF files that I use for work.  It allows you to search and bookmark.  The bookmarks then transfer to your iPhone via MobileMe.  It's nice because I have literally thousands of pages of regulations and tech orders at my fingertips in a very portable format.  The backlight screen is nice when reading in a dark environment and I've found it comfortable to use when reading for 15-20 minuets.  I haven't read any longer than that, so I don't know if it will cause eye fatigue over a longer period.

Video looks great.  64GB is plenty of space.  I'm currently carrying 17 movies, about 11 GBs of music, 10 GBs of Apps, all of my books and I still have about 20 free GBs to load anything else.  I could probably have gotten away with the 32 GB model.

Netflix streaming is awesome!  They have a great selection and the app looks really good.

Games on the iPad are really fun.  I have a few board games and you can sit across from someone and use the iPad as your Monopoly board.  The large display makes it a pretty social device.

The news apps look really good and have the feel of reading a magazine.

Pros - It does everything.  It looks good, is very light and the battery performance is fantastic.  Apple's claim of 10 hrs of use is true.  The battery really lasts a long time.  The 3G service is a good deal.  I don't always use it, so you can set the 3G up to ""pay as you go"".  If you need to use the 3G, you can enter your credit card info right into the iPad and sign up for a month of service.  It's $15 for 250 MB and $25 for 2GB.  You can cancel without a penalty and there's no long term commitment.

Cons - Price.  The iPad is expensive, and you could buy a laptop for the same price (or cheaper).  It's a great device and I think it's worth it, but the price is pretty steep.  Lack of Flash support, which is common to all iOS devices.

Overall, I really love my iPad, I use it for everything and I take it with me routinely."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The iPad 2 is a nice step up from the first generation iPad.  The new thin design only is a reason to select the 2nd generation model over the first.  Much more like a tablet than the first one, the new sleek design is lighter and feels much better in your hands.  Of course the camera is a big difference and it allows you to do things like Skype.  There are some other changes like a doubling of the RAM size, but those first two features are the ones that will immediately jump out at you.  After that, it operates the same as the first generation iPad and is truly one of the cooler tech devices out on the market.	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"I held out a month or so before making the decision to buy an iPad2 32G model. After a month of frequent use, I must say it is the nearest to perfection piece of technology I have ever owned. For context, my use is casual non-pro reading email, checking out Youtube, reading my favorite websites, and playing games. All of these are better than on a PC, Mac, or Ipod Touch, all of which I have experienced and own. Being a guy in his 50's, I like the ability to read with finger swipes, and adjust the font size to suit my eyes. I like the Flipboard app organization of articles I read. I like the expanding selection of strategy games like Ticket to Ride, Civ, and Knizia's games. I find I prefer using this for email over my Mac, because of speed. I like saving pdf files in a ""bookcase."" I like Skyping, although my Mac is better at keeping my mug in the shot. I like showing my pix on it's big screen. The battery really does last 10 hours.

Review for: iPad 2, 32gb 3G White with smart cover.

Good:
- IOS is the only stable tablet OS available right now in my opinion, yes android may be able to multi-task better but 99% of users will not know the difference. As for stability IOS (Apple) is miles ahead of Google.
- Tons of tablet optimized applications, I have around 20 that I use regularly and never had a problem with any of them.
- Zinio iPad application, if you are a Zinio subscriber the iPad is the best way to read your magazines. Much much faster than using even a desktop and also much more pleasant to read and use.
- Can play pretty much any kind of video (including avi, mkv and others)if you install AVPlayerHD and output via HDMI. No stutter like on current batch of honeycomb tablets, at least in 720p which I use...
- Great keyboard (virtual).
- Battery we get around 11 hours on a charge with wifi on.
- Stanby is even better you can most likely leave the tab unplugged and come back a week later to use it. If android phones are anything to go by android tablets probably don't have anywhere near the same standby performance. (can't remember the number of times I forget to plug my android phone at night and wake up with it dead, while my wife never plugs her iPhone and )

Could have been better:
- Flash support would have been good but I can live without it and quite frankly I just wish flash would go away from the web. Its not secure, is a resource hog and basically not very good technology in my opinion.
- An sd card slot for expanding memory or keeping your music/movie collection on. So far I did not see a need for this but could be something I miss in the future.

I don't like (in general for all Apple IOS devices):
- Can only sync to one computer and the iTunes on that computer. What if you have more than one computer ? or quite simply want to load something at work and you are synced with a computer at home ? Your only choice is the cloud and even then you are limited with what you can put on the iPad.

Summary very much like the iPad 2 and just ordered a second one as my wife has taken ownership of the current one. She uses it for work now and pretty much never touches her laptop... She is a university teacher, psychologist and researcher. The iPad is perfect for most of her needs from reading research documents to taking notes and light document writing."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I purchased the motorola Xoom kept it for 2 months could not stand it so i sold it on Ebay and purchased this Ipad 2, i was stupid for even trying another tablet device when knowing i would come back to the IPad. The diffeence between the 1 and 2 is really not that different and don't think the differences in the price really justifies buying the 2 vs 1. Also if your buying it for the camera don't the camera on the device is horrible.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"What can I say?

the iPad is clearly the best in Tablets, and this is Generation 2 So it's just Amazing!

I'll skip talking about the device and it facilities, cuz it's everywhere

about the seller and shipping, actually first I was a little bit afraid of ordering from a seller, because all my previous orders were from / fullfilled by Amazon

but eery thing went very smooth and easy, i Think processing took less than a day, and it was shipped and i got it in my mail box after 4 or 5 days (including weekends)

I'm an International customer, I got it shippied from Seller to my Aramex Shop and Ship Box then Aramex sent it to me in Bahrain

it arrived safe, brand now as it is from the factory, packaging was Excellent

If I needed to order any similar thing, I will sure buy it again from Stoobie if it's offered by them

Thank You"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I owned iPad 1 but, I was surprised when iPad 2 comes out. I was in need for more speed, camera, more battery life (10 hours) and more monitor resolution. Now, I have more satisfaction but still we are in need for Flash module and more development to let us use it instead of our laptop. I am using it for my project management work, some photo / movie editing, emails, presentation, Internet browsing, to do list calendar, friends caring, Facebook, and more. I compared it with motorols Xoom tablet but, I choosed the iPad 2. I love iPad 2 and I have a lot of ideas for it's required development and I hope to get a Chanel to communicate with Apple the greatest company around the world. Also, I have the Mac mini iPod and iPhone. I recommend the iPad 2 as the best tablet in the market.	5	electronics

i Pad 2 is really a great device. I am a new man from the moment I bought it. A lot of functions in my hands. But I though I would be able to install on it my Rosetta Stone courses and the Babylon translator, one of the best tools I have found in my live. The Windows 9 version of Babylon is amazing.  But the Babylon version for iPad is absolutely basic and disappointing. It happens the same with my iMac and my MacBookAir. The Mac Babylon version is incomplete and very basic in comparison with the Windows versions."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I have had in the past an Iphone, and was not keen to buy one again until I was challenged to try the IPAD2. Just loved the performance and the ability to have everything in one tablet, been enjoying it every day, still discovering the features, etc. I recommend for people who travel a lot and like to be in touch with technology.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Highly recommend this item. Forget buying a Kindle when you can download book onto the iPad...free even; local library digital downloads or purchase them! the ease and convenience of using this product is a seller in and of itself. As an educator I now take one item with me to class...the iPad II and students LOVE it! The apps that can be downloaded such as study sets app is great for reinforcing material to be learned (as are many other apps!). I also have netflix app and with the AV cables, I can plug it into any television and watch it on the big screen or take it with me while waiting at the doctors office and watch a movie...it's awesome. Again, apple has won me over!	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	I travel for work and this thing is the best thing you can think of for your frequent traveler ( the only thing you have to watch out for is leaving it in that little pocket but at least they offer software to track it with) Only happened to me once and I got it back.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Before you consider paying a premium on the Amazon Marketplace, read the fine print. The sellers have a long delivery window to get it to you. You have to wait 3 more days to file a claim then they could still could send it up to 2 weeks later. Hopefully, negative feedback would keeping anyone from doing this too many times but this is little consolation for me who paid a premium for something that I would have in my hands if I had ordered from Apple in the first place.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I love my Ipad 2.  Took it on vacation.  Much easier to carry than the laptop.  Great battery life.  Took some time to figure out the keypad and emails but not a lot of time until I had it down.  No owners manual - boo.  Have to read it online.  Free books - yes.  Movies - ok.  Games - fun.  Thanks Apple.!!!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I bought this ipad 2 to take on my trip to Germany. It is light weight and has a great battery life. I found a MaxJournal app that allows me to journal my trip and insert pictures that I have taken. It also lets me send the journal page and photos as pdf to my friends and family back in the US. My daughter just purchased her ipad 2 and we have had fun sharing apps. I highly recommend this product....	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I received the Ipad promptly and in excellent condition. No problems with the setup and everything worked out of the box. Added the leather cover, (ridiculously overpriced for what you get), also bought screen protectors, (impossible to install without at least a few specks of dust to frustrate you), and a protective rubber plastic case to go over the back. I did have a few instances where once you turned off the cellular modem you could not get reconnected without turning it back on and rebooting. However, that has not been an issue for the last several weeks and the modem gets turned on and off several times a day. Either i have been lucky or they fixed the glitch. There is no help manual to accompany the Ipad. I located one through Apple's support site and downloaded the .pdf to the Ipad. I would strongly recommend that anyone looking to purchase an Ipad read the manual while they are waiting for the unit to arrive. It is not as intuitive as I would have liked for someone who is not familiar with Apple products.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Received my iPad 2, it is amazing tool for replacing my pc with a small machine satisfying my need for personal use.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	When I do a search for the Ipad 2 in Amazon, there are quite a few vendors who are selling their Ipad 2 asking for a huge premium. I could just feel and smell the greed from these vendors. My suggestion is if you could wait for another month or so, the supply issue will stabilize and bring the Ipad 2 prices back to its normal price without the price gouging. You could also order from Apple online which I did and I got mine in 8 days. So the choice is yours if you want to support these greedy vendors or get it in 8 days from Apple online.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"The biggest change in our lives so far with the arrival of our iPad 2 is now that we have three of them, no one is without an ipad 24/7.  You wouldn't think this would be a big deal but it is.  It has eliminated all discord here plus the place is quiet as a tomb most of the time as each person is curled up with his own ipad. We are a husband and wife in our 60s plus my husband's mother who is 100 years old. She is curled up with the iPad almost all day long as her ability to do anything active has all but vanished. She goes easily  from reading a Danielle Steele ebook to watching a Prince William and Kate lifetime movie.

The above is both versions of the iPad's biggest virtue: ANYONE OF ANY AGE CAN USE IT.  Both my husband and I are techie types so we are quite expert on computers.  Friends in our age range usually are not.  My advice to every one of them is ""buy an ipad.""  It puts those with low tech abilities on an even playing field because they do everything with their fingers and visually.  It is the supreme compliment to say about either iPad, ""any idiot can use it.""

Right now you can't buy an iPad 1.  We were going to buy a third one of those on sale but they sold out so fast that we had to get the iPad 2 as our third one.  My husband is the one who appreciates subtle refinements in electronics.  He has been in seventh heaven since it arrived.  Truthfully, my mother in law and I, as long as we can get on it and read our books, watch our movies, assemble recipes in our app cookbook, and so forth and so on, are happy as can be and both iPad versions do that extremely well.  My husband is the one who waxes rhapsodically over lighter weight, better LED screen, improved battery life, and so forth.  Like most reviewers of iPad 2 he concludes that it is a beautiful evolution but not a revolution from the first iPad.

For those of you with extended families elsewhere, there are other new features which could be huge features for you.  The ability now to visit with family members by video with your ipad 2 are completely built in.  It has two way cameras. I would like to talk our other family members in California into getting one for the benefit of my mother-in-law, who could have excellent ""visits"" by iPad with all of them.

Also if you want to stream what is on your ipad directly to your HDTV and projectors, that too is now built in. We don't have such a tv because we like watching directly on the iPad itself with earphones.

There is also the ability to not only take your own videos but to edit them online. Plus the ability to locate your ipad if it is lost and to wipe its contents remotely.

These above new features are opening up a lot of possibilities for educators as well.  Apple maintains an entire subsection on its website to helping educators use the new features to iPad 2 to best advantage.  Essentially, it wants to enable them to use the iPad 2 to put its content onto a screen immediately in front of their students with the teacher controlling the whole thing with his or her fingers.  Go over to Apple to check this all out as it is incredible.

I absolutely love the camera on the iPad 2.  There was no camera on the iPad 1.  Much as I have always loved my iPhone's camera, and much as I complained about who would want to use a camera the size of the iPad 2, I admit I underestimated it.  It is just a fabulous camera and with just pointing and shooting you take pictures that look as if a professional had taken them.

I also researched this cover that apple was pushing real hard.  It looks great but i discovered the users were not happy with it.  Turns out they have to clean their screens every time they use it because it leaves three big marks on the glass every time.  They also said it was unstable as a stand and one guy smashed his ipad on the floor as a result, shattering it.  Apple is not very good at these accessory devices.  So we ordered the zoogue ipad 2 case and are very happy with it. We have zoogues on our other two ipads as well and are totally happy with them.  Just put the word zoogue into search engines to find it."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I have never had any type of a tablet but I absolutely love this.  I am a Realtor and I use it in the field quite a bit to show listings, etc.  I also am an avid Harley rider and it fits just perfect in my saddle bag.  I love being able to open it right up from wherever I am and googling my location to see where I need to go.  I love it!!!!!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"To start things off, I have both the iPad and iPad 2.  I agree with most of the reviews stating ""If you own the first one, you can skip the 2nd"".  The iPad 2 is faster but the iPad 1 is still pretty darn fast.  The only only reason why I bought the iPad 2 was for the front facing camera which is pretty cool.

For the gamers I downloaded Deadspace, which is designed to take advantage of the iPad 2's enhanced graphics.  I have to say it's a good looking game and should start to scare Microsoft and Playstation since Apple is starting to further encroach on the gaming market.  I wouldnt be surprised if the next gen iPad is up there with ps3 and xbox 360.  The only thing really holding the iPad back gaming wise is the lack of a bluetooth controller, I hate using the screen as a controller!

If you don't own an iPad I definitely recommend you buy one, it's pretty amazing :P.  Apple has been a game changer for computers and phones for a reason."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I purchased this item for my wife for our anniversary.  I had spend the last several months listening to her complain because her netbook kept locking up while she was using it.  So I gave this a try.  The price was good, the best that I could find on Amazon, but a little higher than what I found at the Apple Store.  But the item was more available than at the Apple Store.  I ordered on a Thursday, received two emails making sure that I understood the shipping process, and then it was shipped.  I had the Ipad 2 in four days from the date of the last email, which was seven days after the order.  Needless to say, it was a big surprise for my wife.  She loves it.  It is easy to use!  The apps load quickly, and are readily available.  Since receiving this gift my wife has started using her Ipad 2 everyday.  Unlike the netbook which was being used a couple of times per week. A great buy, the delivery was quick and the item works like a charm.  We are very pleased with this purchase, thank you Amazon!	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"People need to be aware that the reviews you see for the iPad often reflect the old Mac/PC platform wars with some people making comments who simply don't like iPads from a distance, without actually owning one, because they see it as part of the deplorable Apple mania they find so distasteful.  They're entitled to their opinion, of course, but it is unfortunate they skew the evaluation of this product without the deep acquaintance one needs in order to give it an insightful evaluation.

I have taught computer science at the college level for 26 years and have had computers with all kinds of operating systems. I don't own Apple stock and have never known anyone who works at Apple. I therefore have no connection to Apple.

I have had my iPad for about a month and read a fair number of reviews before I purchased, spent some time using one at the store, and thought about what I might use one for, in contrast to my laptop with which I am well satisfied. People too often think of computers in terms of hardware, the specs and looks, instead of the software and the functionality.  You should ask yourself, ""What will I use this for that solves a problem I would like to have solved?""  Software is always more important than hardware, even though it is the hardware that makes an impression.

The iPad is not a laptop and is not principally a production computer, that is, a computer on which you are going to develop web pages, do serious graphics editing, or write a book.  You could use your new Taurus to tow a trailer, but that is not what it is designed to do well. These things can increasingly be done on an iPad, but I don't believe they will ever be what it is best at.  It is a portable media machine with an inviting touch interface that requires a somewhat different set of skills, which take a modest amount of time to learn.  Surfing the web, checking email, watching movies, playing games, looking at new cars, reading the Economist magazine, all work better on an iPad than a laptop.  It does these things very well indeed. There are now 80,000 apps for a wide variety of activities--given its design intent.  The apps are either free or reasonably priced, so you can get a bunch from the ""app store"" for little investment. As with Amazon, you can see what other people think of an app before getting one.

This would be a splendid acquisition for small children, for teens deep into social networking, for an adult wanting to drop into the love seat for a quick look at what is happening in the world, for a senior citizen who wants a simple, inviting system with few hassles, to stay in touch with grandchildren.  The iPad is not a light laptop; it is instead a different way to use computing to do a wide variety of consumption and communication--not principally production.

In my experience, its wi-fi is adroit from one environment to another.  It ""knows"" where it is geographically, scans its environment for wi-fi, and accesses wi-fi seamlessly.  At this point in time, we should expect no less.  I cannot address the 3G communications since I have a wi-fi only (I am not convinced of the value of the 3G and I can use my phone as a hotspot).  I have never had it crash, though I have had to back myself out of apps that seemed to have no logical next step.  This was the result either of my ignorance or the fact that there is less of a standard user interface from app to app than there is in classical GUIs such as OS X and Windows.

For the laptop lugging road-warrior, it should be noted, this is not going to be a full replacement.  I now take my laptop and my iPad when I go into the college.  But much of the time there, I use my iPad because it is so light, convenient and useable. I use it to teach my classes and often reference traditional texts from the iPad instead of lugging them along to class. I develop my own web pages on my 27"" desktop which is the right environment for such development; I wouldn't expect to do that on an iPad.  In education (and evidently in medicine), it is proving to be a real boon.  The enterprise situations where portable information access and transmission are critical will find this a compelling solution.  The heavy Photoshop user or music track editor will still need a conventional computer, either laptop or desktop.

I purchased the 64GB version, which may be more storage than I need. But since it will drive my 50"" screen downstairs I figured I would begin to load lots of pictures and favored music, so it may prove a wise choice in the long run.  It can swallow up entire evenings with the music-augmented slide shows it can do. In fact, you may begin to wonder if you need cable TV.  Conventional content providers should be worried about the iPad since it provides yet another way for the user to determine viewing experience. But if you are still drawn to cable, it makes a fine remote control.

Before people evaluate this new kind of computing, they need to spend a month or so with it to identify what it does well and what would be better left to other kinds of computing solutions. I fear some of the evaluations here (both glowing and critical) are not well informed and so do not serve the readers well.  So read these reviews with a critical eye.

October 18 2011 Update:

I continue to find my iPad remarkably productive and productive in ways I would not have anticipated. It does indeed redefine how we can use computing so that it does the work we want to do with minimal impediments.  I now leave my laptop at school and take my iPad back and forth since 80 or 90% of the time the iPad does all I need to do.  I use it 3 or 4 hours a day.

I just ordered my wife an 11"" MacBook Air with the larger RAM and storage, which might seem to contradict what I said in my review.  I don't believe it does for the following reasons. She needs to do serious editing of Word documents for the volunteer work she does for the college and still wants the joys of a 2-pound piece of elegant hardware. She is an excellent typist and likes the feel of the Air's keyboard. A keyboard can be added to an iPad, but it's a kludgy add-on that compromises the point of the iPad: an ultra-light slim, touch-interface device that does most of what traditional computing does without the impediments of mouse and keyboard and weight.  The 11"" Air is a gem of engineering with many of the advantages of the iPad but it is more capable of the production I spoke of in my review since it is a full OS X Lion machine--so it is fully capable of running traditional production software such as Word or Photoshop or, for that matter, Windows.

The Air and the iPad illustrate the difference between a consumption device (iPad) and a production device (Air).  Much of what is appealing in the iPad can be had in the Air, but at the cost of an additional several hundred dollars. It's not the solution I want since I don't want the keyboard getting in the way when I want to curl up with a consumption device in my favorite love seat or use it to assist my teaching in class.  My wife prefers the Air since email and other typing-intensive production activities are so important to her. In a word, the iPad is distilled essence of computationally assisted consumption.

I guess we will give the phrase ""mixed marriage"" new meaning!"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"First I bought an Iphone, and was a little worried, as it seemed too slick.  I fell in love with my Iphone and just purchased an Ipad2 and it's amazing. It's crazy thin, it does everything I need it to.  I can answer email, listen to music, watch a video, surf the net, take notes (I love that function), as well a whole lotta other things.  I have even dropped it and it didn't shatter and it was fine.  It's pretty darn sturdy.  I love the fact the learning curve is so easy, and it's customizable.

Okay this is an update - I have had my Ipad 2 now for six months and I still love it!  I order pretty much all my books for the Kindle application that's on the Ipad2, the games are amazing, I just ordered Bard's Tale and it's amazing!

B0013FRNKG	"I just got my new iPad 2.

now i'M going to try to type on the iPad screen. first u can't look away because u can't rest your fingers on the screen-- and even if u could  u couldn't feel the keys. it is much like texting on the iPhone. U have to go to the numbers screen to find the "" ' "" or the numbers. There are no forward or back arrows, so u have to touch the screen where u want the cursor to go.

The good part is that the letter is registered immediately when u hit the key-- u don't have to hit it twice to get it to enter the letter.

All in all, I think an external keypad is needed so I'm going shopping."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I never got the IPad 1. Actually at first I thought it was nothing special. I saw it as an ITouch but a whole lot bigger and no cameras. But when my sister showed me her IPad 2 (and 1). I was convinced this was a great product. So first chance I got, I got one.

Its everything I expected to be..the good stuff I mean...unlike the original IPad this has 2 cameras (vs 0) is thinner and faster. I was able to watch videos in near picture pefect quality. Its so easy to carry or just sit and hold.

There are some problems. Even though it does have cameras...most of the time they feel like a cheap camera you buy at a dollar store. Also no Flash on it, so some sites won't work.

Overall its a great Tablet, yeah there are cheaper tablets out there but only apple has a program where getting viruses and impossible.

Pros:
-Size
-Can never get a virus
-Video quality
-Speed
-Can easily be held and carried

Cons:
-Cameras could be better
-No Flash"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I tried the original iPad and was not overly impressed.  I tried the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MOTOROLA-XOOM-Android-Tablet-Wi-Fi/dp/B0045FM6SU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MOTOROLA XOOM Android Tablet (Wi-Fi)</a>&nbsp;and was happy enough until I tried this iPad 2.  I love this updated version!  The only issue I had was trying to decide which version to get since there are many options.

Storage capacity can be 16 GB, 32 GB or 64 GB.  I would recommend at least the 32 GB since you cannot expand the storage and although apps do not take up much space, I was amazed at the amount of stuff I loaded onto my iPad (photos, movies, music, documents, etc.).  Trying to save some money, I wondered if I should get wi-fi only or the wi-fi/3G combination and with which service provider, AT&T or Verizon? Every iPad has wireless technology built in and automatically finds wi-fi networks easily but if you want to use it while traveling, the great outdoors or rural areas, wi-fi is not always an option.  If you have an iPhone 4, you can use it as a personal wi-fi hotspot for your iPad but your iPhone carrier might charge extra when this option is used.  Also, GPS is on the 3G models only, wi-fi provides an approximate location and this could be an issue if you love using Four Square or other GPS based applications.  More importantly, the wi-fi only model cuts your battery time down (~8 hours).  If you do choose wi-fi + 3G, I would check with AT&T or Verizon networks for pricing before deciding.  Both seem to provide reasonable costs for domestic usage but international usage is outrageous.  The previous iPad allowed any carrier to be used overseas (which is a bargain) but I'm not sure if AT&T and Verizon models allow for the same thing.

This new version is lighter, faster, slimmer and has slightly longer battery life at 10 hours.  I love the brilliant LED backlit display on the 9.7 inch screen.  I'm still not a fan of Pages (iWork) but it is possible to get Word documents on your iPad through iTunes.  There is no official Microsoft version but being able to download Word documents from my pc to the iPad and work on them makes a huge difference for me. I really love the technological improvements that allows this iPad to know your every move and be more responsive.  No matter how you rotate this iPad, the display self adjusts - even if you place it upside down!  It makes playing games like Critter Ball that much more fun to play and allows viewing movies or reading a book in any position.  Need I comment about Apple apps?  They beat the Android and every other market out there on this score and help make Apple products first choice.

For me, The only thing that prevents this tablet from being perfect is a better camera and the lack of Mozilla (I know this will never happen).  I have tried a lot of tablets and prefer this one over all others.  Yes, it is expensive but I consider it a good investment since it allows me to complete tasks on-the-go and help pass the time while waiting.  I think having this iPad along with an iPhone (or any smartphone) is the best combination.  Smartphones can provide information from the web but their small screen size can make viewing difficult and this iPad allows for a perfect union."	5	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"We are now the proud owners of two (2) iPad 2 tablets.  We have one white 64GB WiFi/AT&T 3G and one black 16GB WiFi.

My family all pooled together to buy my son his iPad 2 (after they saw how he was responding to my 3G version).  Unlike many children with autism, my son has never been very computer or technologically inclined.  His interests have always been with physical and tangible objects and interests (not a bad thing, at all)... but we strongly suspected that the iPad touchscreen would change all of that.

There are some remarkable apps for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) - some of which (fortunately) we don't need to use, since my son is very verbal.  That having been said - I have watched how the iPad is completely transforming the lives of his peers who are not very verbal.  Since this isn't a review of the apps, I won't write a whole book about the great apps - except to highlight three that perform really well on the iPad for my son:  1) the ""First Then"" schedule - you can use stock photos, photos you take, or grab them from Google images; 2) Stories2Learn where you can make your own social stories using photos you take; and ""Look in My Eyes"" a game that makes your child look squarely into the eyes of images of children (there is a secret number displayed) that needs to be entered on a next page to get ""prizes"".

Okay - so now a review of the iPad itself...

For the 64GB wifi/3G model - I swore I would only use it for my son and myself... that I wouldn't get sucked into using it for work (since I am the one who paid for it... right?).  Okay, well that plan lasted all of 3 minutes.  I have all of the attachments now: the VGA connector (used it yesterday to put maps up on the wall during a meeting using our projector); the HDMI connector (which is genius - since it has a 2nd port to provide power using your own AC adapter - and I use this at home and at work to plug into the TVs/LCD displays); the USB and SD Card reader (which imports my photos from my Nikon DSLRs); and my sister bought me the bluetooth keyboard (which I thought would be superfluous - but since I AM actually using this for work ALL OF THE TIME - it comes in very handy).  All of the Apple attachments work great.  Yesterday, I received a cheap non-Apple 2100 mAmp car charger from Amazon - and it works GREAT.  Charges, and I'm not afraid of my iPad battery frying!

So, let me get to the two negatives - since that's why YOU are reading this review - right?  You want to figure out what is wrong with this thing... if anything.  The honest truth is that the cameras STINK!!!  Totally, and completely.  So, why give it a 5 star review, right?  The cameras WORK for the purpose that I wanted:  to use facetime to call my sister who lives overseas... and for that - it works passibly well.  Not in low light.  NEVER in low light.  So... I adjust.  Don't call Asia with the lights off!  Problem solved, solution found!  Trying to take photos with the front or back camera - also not great.  REALLY HORRIBLE in the low light conditions I just mentioned.  YET - when you take photos outside in the sunshine - they are actually quite decent.  I'm a photo snob, though - so nothing that didn't come from one of the Nikon DSLRs is suspect to me... DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU ARE HOPING THIS WILL REPLACE YOUR COMPACT DIGITAL CAMERA.  My Blackberry phone camera is a million times better - and I still think that THAT stinks.

While I'm on the subject - let's talk about Facetime.  Apple - it's a great product.  I really love it.  HATE that I can't use it on my iMac at home unless I upgrade to Snow Leopard - which I have no intention of doing.  Glad my son now has his own iPad 2 so that I can call him when I'm at work or on the road... So others who are reading this understand - the Facetime App is a billion times better than the Skype app.  Apple made Facetime to work on their computers.  Period.  As such, it takes those not-so-great cameras I just mentioned, and maximizes their abilities and functionality.  If you can call someone Mac to Mac - use Facetime.

What else don't I like:  the cost of all of those add ons I mentioned.  Seriously!?!?  My choice to buy them.  I will stop my rant.

What I HATE:  the smartcover.  It's horrible.  Don't waste your money on the smart cover!  It's not smart.  I bought the orange - and it's already dirty in the ridges (remember I take this everywhere, and to work... and I work as a project engineering overseeing large dirty and messy job sites) - but the orange was already a sick creamsicle color, but it is just lame.  It doesn't always ""snap"" to the edge with the precision shown in the video commercial.  Just buy something else.  Or save your money.  I am waiting for the Otterbox Defender to come out - since I now realize how much I will travel with this.

Everything else - I love.  The list is long, and I won't bore you.  As a child, I dreamed of such a device... and it meets almost all of my desires and wishes for a non-human user interface.  The AT&T 3G is good enough, don't know if Verizon would have been better... I will always question my decision.  I can watch Netflix - but it doesn't hold coverage on my trainride... but then again, my cell phone from Verizon doesn't either.  There are lots of ""dead zones"" on my train ride to work.  When I'm stationary - in the woods, at a restaurant, in a store - the AT&T signal is typically strong enough to handle the most demanding streaming.

Visually, this object is a stunner.  Physically, this object is a winner:  it feels great in your hands, is responsive to the touch, and it makes everyone want one...

I recommend that anyone who has time on their hands buy one.  If you don't have time on your hands, don't buy one, since you will never sleep..... that is my woe..."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"My first impresion of the iPad 1 was ""it's stupid, don't need it"".  About 2 weeks ago I had a heart attack and my Dr. Told me that I need to have a 1000 cal diet and work out a lot more.  Well I couldn't use my phone for the calory counting, too small.  Well I decided to buy iPad 2 and I was angry, but I knew I needed one for ONE reason is to count calories.  I've had it for about a week now, and I LOVE IT.  I really can't leave with ought it anymore. iPad 2 really is saving my life, with the apps to count my cal, my workout programs, and even my Dr. Can see what I eat and what I do at the gym.  I'm not going to talk about how cool it is to serf the web, and do business on it...  I have a 16 g white iPad.  If you are trying to decide if you want it or not, and you have the money for one,  GET IT, YOU WILL LOVE IT."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I have purchased both an iPad2 and Xoom for different family members.  I thought it worth comparing the two devices for anyone interested.  Many of my comments are subjective so bear that in mind when reading the review.

External appearance and feel:
The iPad2 screen has a different feel from the Xoom screen - the iPad2 is a bit slicker, less likely to stick when moving short distances.  The screen on the Xoom tends to show fingerprints more than the Ipad2 for some reason. Everyone in this family thinks that the iPad2 looks sharper than the Xoom.

Both weigh 1.6 lbs.  Subjectively, the Xoom feels heavier than the Ipad2, but it's an illusion perhaps caused by it's slightly smaller size.  UPDATE:  I need to learn to use the scales - the Xoom is about 3 ounces heavier than the iPad2.

Both have a similar size screen, measured diagonally.  But the aspect ratio is different - 4:3 for iPad2, 16:9 for Xoom.  This means that the iPad2 actually has a larger viewing area, and this makes a real difference when scrolling through a web site.  The iPad2 screen is brighter than the Xoom screen.

Hardware performance:
The Xoom feels a bit faster than the iPad2, and the specs show that it is faster.  Both have dual core processors based on ARM designs.  The Xoom seems to be able to handle graphics better than the iPad2.  As far as connecting to Wifi networks, both seem to have this one down pat - they both just work.

User Interface:
The iPad2 is just like a big iPhone.  Whether this good or bad is subjective.  For me, it's good - polished, flexible and can be customized to my needs.  The Xoom user interface is totally new, and unfortunately it shows - there are many rough edges.  Some examples: moving icons around to group programs together is not intuitive and they keep moving back; you can see the first 5 applications running on the Xoom and select one, but the list doesn't scroll so applications that don't show in the list can't be selected; you can't close applications (except by a force quit that can lose data) as the Xoom decides when to quit an application; customization is possible but more difficult than the iPad2.  In short, the Xoom user interface is a work in progress - great potential but currently quite flawed.

Operating System:
The iPad2 uses Apple's IOS.  It works, but it uses cooperative multitasking which (in theory) is less effective than the full multitasking on the Xoom which uses a version of Google's Android designed for tablets.  In practice, they both work fine and I doubt anyone would notice the difference.

Applications:
iPad2 has 70,000 apps available from the Apple App store and it also runs the 300,000 apps available for the iPhone.  Xoom currently has around 60 apps and it can run Android phone apps (but they are stretched in one direction which makes them look strange).  Some of the iPad2 applications are pretty impressive - GarageBand for example.  There are many games on the iPad2, and just a few games made for the Xoom.  If this doesn't improve quickly, the Xoom is sunk.  After all, applications are generally the reason people buy these devices.

Browsing:
Because of the screen aspect ratio that I mentioned, I prefer browsing on the iPad2.  The Xoom has Adobe Flash and the iPad2 doesn't, but so far I haven't come across a single instance where this has been an issue.  I'm sure there are very many sites not compatible with iPad2, but I haven't browsed to one of them yet.

Camera:
I don't use the camera much, and I'm not really sure if either is better.  In the family, the Xoom owner says the Xoom is better, the iPad2 owner says the iPad2.  The Xoom has flash and iPad2 doesn't which is a win for Xoom, but the Xoom seems slower to take a picture.

Speakers:
The Xoom has two small speakers, iPad2 has one slightly larger speaker.  The sound is somewhat better quality on the iPad2 and the Xoom cannot achieve the same volume as the iPad2.  But they are both pretty poor - use earphones or an external speaker if you want decent audio.

Battery life:
Difficult for me to give an exact comparison, but based on family usage it seems the iPad2 has the edge here, but not by much.

Internal storage:
The Xoom has 1GB of RAM and 32 GB of flash storage.  The iPad2 has 512MB of RAM and 16GB, 32GB or 64GB of flash storage - I bought the 64GB model.

External storage:
The Xoom has an external card slot that supports SD cards, but the software was not ready in time for the product release.  The slot is inoperative until Motorola releases an operating system update.  The iPad2 has no external storage support.

User Experience:
The iPad2 was up and running quite quickly.  I connected the device to iTunes and it automatically updated to the latest version of the operating system.  I was then able to select and download Apps immediately and start using them.

The Xoom was not so easy.  For some reason, I was not able to install the latest version of Google Maps or Adobe Flash.  I was able to download the apps, and the install process appeared to work without errors, but the new apps just were not installed.  After some time trying I finally returned the Xoom back to the factory settings and started again, and this time both the installs worked.  Of course, this wouldn't be a good solution if you had a ton of applications and/or data on the device.

Support:
Apple has their retail stores.  You can get a huge amount of help from these stores from people whose only job is to support users.  Both iPad2 and Xoom users have web sites available that support their products but you have to spend the time digging for the sites and digging through the sites.  You can also purchase an Applecare support package which gives you a couple of years extra support for the iPad2.

Bottom line:
I believe the Xoom hardware may be slightly better than the iPad2 (apart from the screen aspect ratio and the speakers), but the software is terribly lacking.  The Xoom was released FAR too early, it's just not ready for primetime.

If I had to pick just one, I'd pick the iPad2 - less hassle, apps for everything, better browsing experience, better support options.  The Xoom needs less buggy software and more applications; it has potential but it's not there yet.  And by the time it gets there, there will be something better available.

Update 7/5/2011

We have now had the two devices for over 3 months.  During that time Motorola released an update to fix some of the issues with the original Xoom.  It's somewhat faster, the problem of only seeing the first 5 applications is fixed, there are some extra capabilities for USB, and most importantly, the Xoom doesn't crash every few hours.

However, the biggest issue with the Xoom is still the number of applications available to run in native tablet mode, as opposed to running Android phone applications.  I've read that there are 300 applications available, but it's hard to find them.  The Android Market doesn't distinguish between phone applications designed for a small screen  and tablet applications.  You have to read the description of each application to see what it is designed to run on, and finding 300 apps in 200,000 is very time consuming.  Apple claims to have 100,000 iPad specific apps in their store.

Another problem with the Android Market is the complete lack of supervision.  I understand that anybody can put any application there without any review, and I've read there have been a few problems with malware.  Recently I saw an article that claimed there are spyware applications on the store, which worries me a little.  I'm not saying you can't get malware from the Apple store, but Apple does look at the apps first - I'm not aware of any malware getting into the Apple store.

The iPad2 does have some downsides I wasn't aware of when I wrote my review.  It would be nice to have a general purpose USB connection and a card slot.  There is an extra-cost adapter available from Apple that supplies HDMI out and a limited function USB connector.  Also the keyboard attachment made for the original iPad doesn't work on the iPad2.

For us, the iPad2 is the winner.  The Xoom is sitting on a shelf and I don't think it's been used over a week now.  In contrast, iPad2 is in use every day and continues to be a big hit.  The primary problem with the Xoom is the lack of tablet-based applications.

Update 7/7/2011

The Xoom has been sold to a colleague who wants an Android tablet.  I think the Xoom is better than most of the Android tablets currently available.  However, the Honeycomb software feels so unfinished, and the paucity of available tablet-based applications was a major issue.  I lost several hundred dollars on the sale, but nobody wanted to use it and there was no point in letting it lay around unused.  I'm already under some pressure to buy another iPad2, but I want to wait to see if the rumors of another iPad version in September are true."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"""WE SHIP TECH"" is a great reliable company. I ordered the iPad2 late 3/30 @ 10:50pm and received the iPad2 4/1. When I wrote an email to them on the 3/31 they responded in about 20 min max. It's so hard to find great customer service and not get scammed these days that ""We Ship Tech"" is a breath of fresh air!! I would surely use them again and highly recommend them to anyone who expects great products & service. Thank you We Ship Tech!!!!!"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"If you're deciding whether or not to buy an iPad 1 or iPad 2, you may want to read this first.  I've had an iPad 1 for 9 months.  Before I bought it, I doubted how much I would use it.  It had no hard drive, USB connectors, DVD player, camera, full keypad, ability to load major business software apps, ability to play flash-developed graphics, and it did not have much storage and memory space.  I wondered how it could be useful to me, since I had many Apple products - Mac Pro, Macbook Pro, iPhone, Mobile Me, Airport, Time Capsule, etc.

To my delight the iPad provided 100x my wildest expectations.  Once you start using it for searching the Web and researching just about everything you do, you realize how much more you can get out of the Web and Internet every day.  You begin making tons of use of the Web and it makes you become way more productive in life (home, autos, service providers, education, children, parenting, illness, job, professionally, etc., etc., etc.).  It ends up becoming an extension of your hand, mind, and life.  It doesn't take you over, it merely helps you with everything you do.

Email is also a different experience using an iPad.  You find yourself no longer reading email on your phone or computer.  You end up having your iPad with you, no matter where you are.  Email is extremely easy to read and is organized in way never thought possible.  I bring it in stores, theaters, healthcare providers, hair salon, work, lunch, and e v e r y w h e r e !!  it's way too easy to use and to make you much more productive.

All this, and I haven't even gotten to the thousands of extremely useful and productive apps, movies, podcasts, music, etc., available (via iTunes).  You can have every type of app, from sophisticated business intelligence dashboard software to first class presentation software, to science, astronomy, and tons of world-class games.  All in addition to the new extension to your brain and hand (mentioned above).  So, don't get hung up about USBs, DVDs, and hard disks.  You can get a VGA cable, external camera connection cable, and a myriad of cases and multi-use devices.  You will not even want your regular computer after a month.  iPad 2 brings us to a new level, with two cameras, 2x the speed, thinner/lighter, and great new OS features.  If you try an iPad for 30 days, you will never want tp be without it.  I do not sell iPads and I have NO affiliations with Apple or their resellers.  Load the Auryn Ink app and use a Nomad brush.  You'll swear you were really painting on a canvas.

Transformed from iPad slayer to iPad bigot."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	After playing around with it, I have to agree with previous reviews. The only thing I would add is the fact that store managers pointed out to me that the only way to do webcam is using Facetime. This is not true at all. I downloaded the yahoo messenger app and was able to do webcam with yahoo users on Windows PCs. For Ebook readers it is an awesome device. It has all the features of a Nook and if you turn the Ipad sideways (landscape) it will show both side of the pages as if you were reading a real book. I also like the graphics on the way the pages flip.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I purchased the original iPad 64GB with Wifi back in October of last year.  If I had know that an updated model was going to become available so soon, I would have waited for the iPad 2. So, do you really need the iPad 2?  Frankly, there are three major differences between the original iPad and the iPad 2.  First, the iPad 2 is noticeably lighter and sleeker.  It is more comfortable to hold for longer periods of time, especially if you like to read e-newspaers or ebooks. Secondly, the iPad 2's processor is a lot speedier.  Page turns are quick, boot time is fast, and surfing the internet is a breeze. Last of all, the iPad 2 has a camera. This, however, is its weakest feature. Do not expect the same results you would get from a digital camera or digital webcam. (I could have lived with a model that has no camera.) The other differences are minor (e.g., the automatic turn on/turn off feature). For me, the iPad 2 is a better product for what I needed (reading and surfing the net).  Before you get rid of your original iPad, I would check it out at a retail store along side your original.	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"hello
i am from saudi arabia and our 3 communications companies are using (UMTS/HSDPA/HSUPA and GSM/EDGE) with the same frequncies of AT&T
can i use their IPAD2 in my contry??
i wish that i can get an answer

thank you"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"As a geek for friends and family I have already taken delivery of my IPad 2 32GB WI-FI + 3G with AT&T even though they're still in short supply because of all the sadness that's hit Japan, even though 4 week delivery times are being promised, don't expect it this fast.  Since the IPad uses dedicated memory, don't be surprised if the delivery date is extended out a bit since all the parts to put this wonderful device are just not out there.

A device that's finally proven once and for all that we can compute different ways, this wonderfully powerful and as always easy to use device is proving why the tablet computer is our next exploding tech market.  Our head guy here at Amazon said in his interview here that we'll see over 40 tablet style computers on the market by this coming Christmas and now I understand why.  The simple fact is much of our time on line is spent simply reading stuff.  Then why carry around a keyboard we're not using?  Be it via Wi-FI or 3G, the upload speeds are simply astounding so we can read or watch videos at speeds that will astound even jaded users such as myself.  Don't look at an IPad 2 as a new computer.  Look at it as a different way of computing.

Another surprise with the IPad 2 is in their ability to handle business applications and environments.  The first generation was geared toward those who liked looking chic at overpriced coffee shops.  This model is a real tool - a real computer - a really different way of doing things in the most user friendly and portable way possible.  Do accept the fact that you'll be spending additional dough on accessories such as keyboard, screen protectors, a stylus and more, but thanks to Amazon I've found deals that's made this as painless as possible - actually quite affordable!

Do we need one, of course not.  Will our lives be a whole lot more fun and even more productive with one, beyond a doubt.  Don't hurt yourself buying one, but if you're like me and would rather live without pizza and beer twice a month so I can afford my latest toy, then this is something any user will have a blast with in everyday life no matter what you're doing.  Now why haven't you got yours ordered yet?"	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"The iPad is an invaluable travel companion if you are a frequent travelet.

Why do I preffer black vs white? If what you mostly do is watch videos on your iPad you want it with the black bezel because the video will blend with the black bezel and look larger than with the white it becomes kind of a distraction, this is the reason why most TV's in the market have a dark or a black bezel.

Portability of this thing is amazing, Its light and its easy to lug around when you are traveling. Also the battery life is exceptional, I'm bad at keeping my devices charged up and I have done a couple of 8 hour trips and my ipad was stil kicking when I landed and a few days after, Im truely surprized.

For those of you debating between the 3GAT&T, 3GVerison or the Wifi version, it depends on where you go to. I had the original 32 wifi only and I was very happy with it I noticed I got Wi-Fi access at a lot of places and I could also use the wifi hot spot on my phone to connect however, in recent travels I have been sent to middle of nowhere america where AT&T has no 3G coverage and hotels have no wifi (yes they are out there, hotels that still have no wifi) after I returned from my last trip to said location I decided I should get the Verizon iPad simply from the coverage perspective and since the 3G service is not on contract and the Verizon plans have more options I decided that was my choice. Now is this the best option for everyone, no! I think the 3G is just for a small amount of users the vast majority should be fine with a 16GB or a 32GB, if you know your way around the app market place and apps like Air Video Server and tools like DVD Fab and TVersity you don't need that much storage space on your iPad you can simply stream everything. Besides, I have a 32GB and I have 57 videos loaded in that 32GB iPad which if I watch 10-12 on a trip it is an overstatement, I'll watch a few on the plane but the rest, Im streaming from my Media Center at home or from NetFlix. When talking to people in line I was shocked at the number of people looking for the Verizon version when they do not travel, people if you are home most of the time just use your wifi, its cheaper and its faster! Another thing to note is that if you are an international traveller and want 3G the Verizon iPad is NOT Global wireless (so no 3G anywhere outside of the US) however wifi will work just fine.

You will see people complain about resolution and such and honestly, I think the resolution is perfect, the iPad is not meant to replace your laptop or your desktop or your TV, if it was why they would have bothered with airplay? If you are expecting to dump your laptop because you got an iPad think again, if you just use your laptop for browsing pages and playing games then you might get away with it however if you expect to do Office on these, think again, until MS gets their act together and decides that IOS is another venue of revenue for them I will still need to carry my laptop around to do word/excel/ppt files. Lack of flash support has not bothered me, yes I wish I could see some pages however, Im not in to the too flashy stuff (no pun intended) I rather get the straight text and keep going my only gripe would be that when Im conected via WiFi I would like to get full pages and not the mobile version however that is not an iPad problem it is a server problem.

Overall my score goes as follows
Comfort and portability A+
Battery Life A+
App Diversity and usability A+
Interface A+
Expandibility C (I don't need a USB port or anything like that however it is annoying that if I ever needed and expansion either I have to pay for an adapter or its not available)
TV Out Support B+ (simply judging that for HDMI you have to buy the dongle)
Cammera Quality C (who needs a cammera in their iPad anyways? Face time sure, rear facing meh)

Other thoughts:

Get a screen protector, I tried the Invisible Shield for my Gen 1 and hated it, the material removes the slickness of the screen and makes it harder to interact. I like the Splash screen protector, it is like its not there and it does make cleaning a bit easier.
Get a case this thing is beautiful but if you would like to maintain its resale value get a case that cover both front or back or separate covers, I think the Vapor case hack is pretty interesting.
Investigate tools like DVD Fab Video Converter (excellent for making iPad versions of your DVD's and BD's and it does take care of EVERYTHING for you from conversion to the right format to importing to iTunes) TVersity and Air Video for content streaming.
Be realistic on your expectations, I know Apple calls their products magic and their user interface and experience is fenomenal however there are limitations as to what these things can do so try to make an informed purchase that you are happy with instead of rushing and then having something that doesnt meet your expectations. For me I was debating between this and a mac book air however for me since I have to lug around my work computer anyways this won."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Um, can anyone please explain why this is selling for over $900?  I can go downtown to the Apple store and buy the same one for $829.

B0013FRNKG	"The Apple iPad.  Those of us who own one have recently been called less than flattering names for daring to use it and enjoying the experience!  But the devices' popularity is growing; indeed I am seeing them everywhere.  Just yesterday I sat next to a woman at my local Ford dealership who was reading a book on her iPad even as I held a text message conversion with a good friend while reading the news from CNN and NPR.

For me the device fulfills several different functions I have been meaning to purchase in separate devices, like an e-book reader, portable music player for my master bedroom, and electronic photo frame.  Why buy all three of those devices when the Apple iPad does all three functions in one neat silver (albeit expensive) package?  And since buy my iPad in the Fall of last year, the uses for the device have grown tenfold, until now, it is almost indispensable.

Now Apple has released the iPad 2 and those of us who use the original are throwing them over for the next big, or should I say smaller thing.  Since this new one was for the business I work for I decided to do a one for one replacement of the one I already used for testing purposes; in other words I ordered an ""iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G"" version.

The ""iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi /3G"" Facts

On the surface the iPad 2 is not demonstratively different from the iPad Original.  Featuring a Dual-core (Apple designed) 1 GHz A5 processor, the 1.33 pound (1.34 pounds for the 3G) iPad 2 is notably thinner than the iPad Original, though the screen size stays the same.  The other big changes: two camera, one rear facing, the other front facing now ship standard with all models; and the graphics are reportedly 9 times as fast.

No matter what hardware version (Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi/3G, 16GB, 32GB, or 64GB) you chose the Ultra-Portable, iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/ 3G is a simple device with very few moving parts.  The power button sits on the top of the device on the right, while a standard 3.5mm headphone jack is situated on the far left.  Along the right edge of the 0.5"" thick iPad you'll find the screen lock/mute and volume control switches, while the bottom of the 9.56"" long device is reserved for speakers and the USB/power port.  The USB port is proprietary so, no, like the iPad Original you cannot plug a USB memory stick into it, but with the provided cord you can plug it into your computer and into an outlet to recharge the device.

The ""iPad 2"" (also available in black and white body styles) can be had with 16GB, 32GB, or 64GB of memory, and all iterations are fitted with a 1GHz Apple A5 custom-designed, high performance, low-power processor.  Internet connectivity is through either Wi-Fi (802.11a/b/g/n), and or 3G: UMTS/HSDPA (850, 1900, 2100 MHz) and GSM/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz).  Bluetooth 2.1 EDR is also provided with either configuration.  A 4G model of the iPad2 has not been announced.

The 9.7-inch fingerprint resistant LED-backlit glossy widescreen multi-touch color display offers 1024x768 resolution and can display multiple languages and characters simultaneously.  The IPad 2 is fitted with an ambient light sensor and the device supports 576p and 480p with Apple Component AV Cable; 576i and 480i with Apple Composite AV Cable and 1024x 768 with Dock Connector to VGA adapter.

Re-syncing with iTunes

The iPad 2 will sync up whatever Apps, music, Podcasts, movies, etc., connected/ associated with your iTunes account and currently on your iTunes desktop.  I was able to sync the iPad 2 to iTunes and like magic everything that was on my iPad 1 showed up on my iPad 2, sans the folders I had set up to group Apps in.

Transferring My AT&T 3G Account

All of the iPad 64GB Wi-Fi/3G devices I have purchased thus far use AT&T for their 3G service.  There are two plans at the time of this review: $14.99 for 250MB a month data package and $25.00 for 2GB date package.

A funny thing happened along the way to transferring my current 3G plan to my new iPad 2: AT&T killed (deactivated) the removable SIM card in the iPad 1.  They claim they needed to, but I'm not so sure, because it makes no sense to me.  Another (micro) SIM card can be obtained from the nearest AT&T store for free, though so stores may charge you $15.00, so check around.  Once the new SIM is inserted into the iPad 1 you can set-up and activate the 3G service on the device.

Note: unused data package byte (for lack of a better term), cannot be rolled over from month-to-month.  Conversely, if your plan minutes run out during the month AT&T will not automatically anoint you with more; more minutes can be purchased from the iPad 2, but it is a manual process.  However, the package will be renewed at the end of the 30 days, and continue to renew every 30 days unless stopped.

Microsoft ActiveSync

Surprisingly, or maybe not so surprisingly, setting up the iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G to use Microsoft Exchange via Exchange ActiveSync is simple and easy; all told it took less the two minute to start receiving my business e-mail on the device, and there does not seem to be a limit to the number of devices associated with a given ActiveSync account.

After I established the connection via ActiveSync I verified inbox functionality by reading, responding to, forwarding, and moving, e-mail.  The iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G even allows you to choose whether or not you want to download your business contacts and calendar; sweet!

And once connected I am able to control password usage, minimum and maximum length, age, complexity, and expiration via an Exchange ActiveSync policy.  The policy can also control other aspect of the iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G's including third-party e-mail account creation; Windows SharePoint Services and Windows File Shares access; message size limits; attachment downloading, as well as a host of other security related features and functions.

Word to the wise: Exchange ActiveSync policies, limited as they can be configured to disable a number of features on the device including camera, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi.  And yes, utilizing ActiveSync I can even wipe the iPad 64GB Wi-Fi/3G from the Exchange server, and as long as the tablet remains a part of the ActiveSync policy it will continue to wipe every time its powered on unless it is either removed from the policy or the check mark is removed from the radio button instructing ActiveSync to ""Perform a remote wipe to clear mobile device data.""

VPN Access

The iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G has VPN access and it actually work quite well.  There are three options: L2TP, PPTP, or Cisco IPSEC. Like Exchange ActiveSync the VPN functionality was surprisingly easy to set up and get going, all one needs to know is what information to plug in and away we go!

VPN took less than a minute to set up and configure, and once complete I was able to log into my company Intranet and thanks to some (free) Apps I was able to RDP into my workstation from the iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G; again, sweet!  Yes, the lack of makes maneuvering around the desktop somewhat challenging, but I could still get around the desktop and use it.  Note: there are paid versions of the Apps I used that offer crude mouse functionality.

Like all of the network components on iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G VPN can be togged on and off at will.

First Impressions:

Like my personal iPad 1, I really, really, really, like the Apple iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G I have been testing.  Naysayers aside this thing is cool and I am happy to own one and even take it out in public!  I love being able to take my favorite book(s) with me when I am on the go, and I have the ability to stop at a Wi-Fi hotspot and plugging into the Internet in order to read the latest news, get the weather, run an application, etc.

But, I really like the fact that I can take the lightweight iPad 64GB Wi-Fi/3G with me everywhere and still gain access to my pre-selected books, magazines, music and images, not to mention a seemingly endless supply of useful applications.  And let's not forget the Internet and business e-mail.

Today while was waiting in line (yes I said line) for my dealership to open up so I could get me car serviced, I brook out my iPad 2 and started watch videos on Vevo; now how cool is that?

Setting up Wi-Fi is easy enough; the antenna is always on and looking for new connection.  I set up the iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G to use the secure wireless setup at work; I typed in the pass-phrase via the incredibly handy keyboard and surfed the Internet; simple and easy.  Since I bought the iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G I have taken it out frequently to places that offer free Wi-Fi access and in only one instance did I have an issue connecting.  Nice!  And even then I effortlessly switched to 3G and, instance access.

Conclusions

Like the iPad 1 before it the iPad 2 is the must have device of the decade, period!  Not a day goes by when I do not use it for something.  I love the portability of the device, the ease of use, the utilitarian nature of the unit, thanks in large part to the plethora of Apps that can be down loaded and utilized for the tablet.

Is the iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G ready for the enterprise?  I say yes with a few caveats; chief among them is the inability of the tablet to truly manipulate Microsoft Office Applications without the assistance of the Documents-to-Go application ($9.99).  Second is the inability to truly mirror the iPad screen on a monitor, however with the Apple Digital AV Adapter that can be changed.  Video can be presented onto the screen--via an HDMI connection.  Lastly, is the lack of available USB port(s) or a memory card reader that will accept memory devices and help you keep files organized on-the-go, as well as the ability to truly turn the iPad into a mobile office.  As it stands now any document you want to work with must be e-mailed and then opened.  However, the iPad was never marketed as a laptop, or laptop replacement, so...

Not that these problems cannot be overcome, but they are limitation that a laptop and even netbooks do not suffer from.  However, hands down, the Apple iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G is a performance winner, and one heck of an e-book reader! Yes, the entrance fee (799.00) is steep, and enterprise customers will have to think long and hard at the cost, however the iPad now has a certain ""cool"" factor that is hard to escape.  The more large enterprises adapt the iPad and find practical uses for it, the more popular it will become in the hall of corporate America.

So far the iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G has more than lived up to my expectations and I have fun testing the limits of its ability to operate effectively in the enterprise and personal environments."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I will admit that the cameras on the iPad 2 are not the greatest but the naysayers have to admit that the iPad 2 is so much faster and thinner than the first generation (to me, that makes it a great update).  I Skyped my parents in Florida for the first time last night (there is no HD version of Skype, so you have to 2X it to fill the screen) and it worked very well.  Last year, I played around with a friends original iPad and decided to be patient and wait for the iPad 2.  So glad I did, the iPad 2 is FAST.  Apps open instantaneously and it is a sleek machine.  I have a hard time putting it down.  I realize that the iPad 3 will probably have some major upgrades but if you have waited for the iPad 2 just get one and enjoy it.  It is the best tablet out there!	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"If you're considering a tablet, the only rational choice is the iPad 1 or the iPad 2. Anything else you there is too expensive/too buggy/lacking support/etc. As someone who owns a desktop but no laptop, the iPad 2 is just perfect. A laptop would often be redundant, though it would be handy for working outside of the home.  With the iPad, I will use it all the time both in the home and elsewhere.

I will try to add some comments that haven't been covered:

* I find that 16gb is fine, though this may change if app sizes get much larger. I don't intend to store my music or a bunch of videos on this. Videos can be streamed, or added as-needed, and I rely on DropBox to store files - it lets me view and edit files between my desktop and my iPad.

* Part of the reason the iPad is perfect for travel is that you can use it in any position, unlike a laptop, where you have to find a seat.

* It won't ever got hot or overheat. Personally, I've had a couple laptops expire on me due to overheating. You always have to keep them on a firm surface so you don't block the vents. The iPad doesn't have these problems (I think that the Macbook Airs similarly will never overheat). You no longer have to grab a tray or giant book to set your laptop on when using it in bed.

* Terrific value. All hype aside, the design, durability and capability of an iPad 2 is such that I would expect to pay much more. You can find a cheap laptop for the same price, and it will be capable of much more. However, the iPad will accomplish 95% of what you want to do on a computer, and will open doors (via apps) to new and totally unexpected experiences.

* Browsing the web is better on the iPad. At least, it often is. It's certainly better to take your iPad on the couch than to hunch over a laptop on the coffee table. Though the screen is small compared to a desktop screen, it's equivalent to working on a bigger screen because of how close you will be. Scrolling and navigating a webpage with your hand is a qualitatively better experience than using the tools we've become accustomed to (mouse, trackball or trackpad). I guess that's why sci-fi movies always depict computers with touch interfaces in the future. Moving the page around and adjusting the size of everything by hand never gets old.

* Just like with my iPhone 4, I rarely sync my iPad 2. I'm not a huge fan of iTunes. I can sync occasionally to back-up my apps. I don't use iTunes to manage files (again, I rely on Dropbox). Dropbox and Evernote are must-have apps on all my computers and portable devices.

* Safari can use some work. I prefer the tabbed browsing, not having to switch windows. There are some alternative browsers (I bought 360 Browser, which is good), but Apple won't let me select those as my default browser. I don't use Safari on my desktop, but even if I wanted to sync my passwords and history, I don't think it'll let me (it will sync bookmarks through iTunes though). I really wish Apple would loosen up so that Firefox or Chrome would be available, and that one of those could be my default.

* As cool as the smart cover is, I spent my money on a wireless keyboard instead. I really don't think the smart cover is going to make a difference as long as I take other measures to protect my screen. I may skip the HDMI adapter as well - it would be fun, but there is never a time that I will need to project my iPad on my HDTV.

In summary, if you think you'd like it, you'll probably love it. If you are just kinda curious but content with your current set-up, you can save yourself the money. For the same price, you can get an adequate laptop running Windows 7. I think this is a great alternative though."	5	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Not previously owning an iPad I did not know what to expect purchasing the iPad 2. After using it for weeks though, I can honestly say it is perfect and has no problems that I can comment on. After purchasing a wireless keyboard, I plan on completely replacing the computer with this tablet. Netflix and other amenities are great as well. I would get black though, I see the white becoming faded and not as clean looking after a while.	5	electronics
