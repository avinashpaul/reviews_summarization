B0013FRNKG	"So after picking it up Friday and playing around with it most of the weekend, what's the final word? Seemless. If you had the first one and moved to the 2nd one, it's worth the move. I made a back up of the original and after going through iTunes everything just moved right over. Made a few tweeks here and there but otherwise it was painless.

As far as the size goes, it's definently lighter than the first one and it's really lighter than the XOOM, which I had a chance to play around with on Saturday. Also due to the size, it feels like it swims around in the original's case so you definently will want a new one. With the new case, Apple really wants you to show off the sleekness of the device which is cool, but you want to take advantage of having AppleCare in case you accidentally drop it and it breaks. When things get smaller and slimmer, it always tends to feel more fragile. My complaint about the exposure is the back of the iPad which I can see being scuffed in a few weeks so I may get something to protect the back of it. Otherwise, this truly looks like a slate.

It does feel speedier when loading up apps and as far as gaming goes, some like Infinity Blade and Shadow Guardian really gets a boost from the extra speed. They look much better and the loss of framerate is not as noticable as the iPad 1's.

There is however still a bit of barely noticable stutter in some movies shown via Netflix when streaming which makes me hope that the next gen iPad has the Retina Display or something better for true on the go HD viewing.

The cameras, while not the best ( I still don't see someone trying to do serious photography with this so this is not a big deal for me) still does very great with Face Time support. I demoed it a few times with one of my friends who also had the ipad 2 (as well as the iPhone 4) and people who has never seen Face Time in action were astounded. This was the video phone that we only imagined back in the 60s and 70s.

There is still no SD Slot, no Thunderbolt support however the battery still holds a charge ( I just charged mine for the first time last night) and the screen is more bright and crisp than that of the XOOM.

Apple has done a good job at taking the next step with the iPad and any competitor that had something coming out this year really need to take notes because if they don't move swiftly enough, Apple will dominate the tablet space in a similar fashion as they did the mp3 space with the iPod.

If you had the first one ther are a few small surprises that you are in for, if this is your first one, you will be amazed about what you have missed out on."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The Ipad2 is a great device but the same model is much cheaper elsewhere. This same exact 16 gig wifi sells for about $150 less at places like Best Buy and Apple's own website.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"For anyone out there who is considering whether or not to make the leap and purchase the iPad 2, this review is for you. If you're still debating between the iPad 1 and the iPad 2 check out my review of the first generation iPad right here on Amazon to see a discussion of its strengths and weaknesses with a number of people commenting (both positively and negatively) over the past 11 months.

Let me begin by saying this upfront, I don't work for Apple, I don't own Apple Stock, and whether you buy an iPad, Xoom, a laptop or a pad of paper and pencil I don't get anything for writing this. I'm not an Apple ""fanboy"" although I can give credit where credit is due and lately Apple has deserved a lot of credit for some of their products.

Physical Characteristics
The iPad 2 is absurdly thin. More importantly than it's thinness is its tapered edge which feels more natural in your hand. One of the biggest complaints about the original iPad was it really wasn't tremendously comfortable to hold for long periods at a time. For a tablet device designed to be held, that's a pretty big deal. Apple really has done an amazing job of cramming everything into an even smaller space than before and the difference is really noticeable when you're holding the device. In addition to the tapered edge, Apple managed to reduce the overall weight of the iPad 2. That might not seem like a huge deal to most, especially when you consider the weight difference isn't tremendous when you're already under 2 pounds, but I spend a good part of my day holding the iPad in my hands and the weight difference is surprising by the end of the day. The first generation isn't heavy by any means, but the iPad 2 outshines it.

New and ""Improved""
Apple doubled the RAM in the iPad 2 from 256MB to 512MB. What does that mean? For most casual users, probably not a whole lot. There is a performance bump that everyone will see the effects of in things like loading times for webpages that are open in the background, but 256MB was sufficient for most daily use and games. If you're planning to use your device for some of the more graphically intense games the iPad 2 does offer a better method of graphics processing that'll help deliver faster images with fewer jerky movements. If you're just playing Angry birds and reading e-mail you're not going to know the difference.

The screen is the same for all real purposes. It is technically a ""new"" part in that it isn't identical to the old, it's a bit thinner and more efficient, but it's the same resolution. The Glass is thinner though, and this amounts to a fair bit of the weight loss from one generation to the next. In playing with the device it seems surprising but despite feeling lighter it actually feels more sturdy in your hands. I still wouldn't suggest dropping it, but if it were to fall the iPad 2 certainly feels like it might stand a better chance to survive. Try not to drop it though.

The addition of 2 cameras was expected. Some were a bit surprised to see the first generation released without the cameras. Whether it was for a price point consideration, or a means to get people to upgrade, Apple held off until iPad 2. The cameras do a reasonable job, but they're not going to replace a dedicated digital camera, or really even the camera on your phone for most still images. The cameras do a substantially better job with video, and FaceTime is probably one of the best reasons to get the iPad 2 over the original iPad. For those who might not be familiar, FaceTime is Apple's face to face conferencing system, kind of like Skype, or if you'd rather, kind of like the Jetson's TV/Phone. With the push of a button you can be having a face to face chat with a loved one just about anywhere in the world (provided they're on a wireless network at the time). FaceTime doesn't work over 3G natively (it can be used over a wifi connection created by a 3G device however) so you're not going to be able to use it in your car anytime soon. This is probably a good thing though. It is incredibly easy to use and if you know other people with an iPad 2, iPhone 4, or Mac it's a lot of fun.

Smart Covers aren't really ""smart"" but they're really very useful. Not only do they provide a stylistic enhancement of the device, but they serve a practical and functional purpose of doubling as a screen protector and stand in 2 configurations. You can find them in a variety of colors and from third market suppliers, and it's a safe bet that more will be out soon to capitalize on the magnetic sensors in the iPad 2. It's unfortunate that this same feature can't somehow be retrofitted to the iPad 1, I wouldn't have thought a case would be a compelling reason to consider a product over it's competitor, but these covers are really so useful it's hard to understand why they've not been there since the beginning.

Multitasking Support
One of the biggest knocks against the iPad when first released was the lack of native multi-tasking support. Jailbreakers added the feature quickly and Apple soon realized it would be a requirement for any future device's success and released an OS update that included the feature. The iPad 2 capitalizes on that progress and takes it a step further with the increased RAM enabling more open applications to be suspended at once, and the time to open or close an application has improved as well. That said, even the first generation managed to open and close apps faster than most people would be used to on their computers, so while this is an improvement it's more akin to showing off.

Apps
One thing that Apple has clearly the advantage in for the moment is app availability. The App store has close to 70,000 iPad specific Apps, all of which will work on the iPad 2. The new cameras will undoubtedly see this list expand rapidly, as will the inclusion of a gyroscope for gaming and motion based uses. There are also a substantial number of professional applications ranging from document creation to photo editing and vector drawing. Chances are if you can dream it, there's an App for that (and if not you might want to get started on one to fill in the gap). The Android market is making a strong showing, and ultimately it'll likely be a strong competitor, for now it still has a ways to go, but any potential buyer should consider the strength of the application market before buying a tablet.

Pros:
Weight. Seriously. The minimal weight of this thing is by far the most impressive feature about it in my opinion. It seems to defy physics and logic that so much could be in such a small space working that hard for that long.

Battery Life. From full to dead my iPad 2 went just over 11 hours with the movie Robin Hood showing twice during that time, the screen at half brightness, wifi turned on, an Angry Birds marathon and a good portion of a book in ibook. That's better than a work day and that's constantly on.

Books. This is definitely a Pro, but reading itself could go either way. The great benefit to the iPad is having access to Google Books, ibook, Nook, and Kindle. This allows for some comparison shopping and price competition (although for the most part they're all usually about the same). Reading in the evenings in bed is great as the back light means you don't have to worry about keeping others awake, but the glass screen causes some glare trouble when trying to read outside or near a sunny window. If you're an avid outdoor reader the Kindle might still be your best bet.

Cons:
Still no dedicated USB support. While there is a camera add-on that allows for certain USB devices to be used there is no option for mass storage. Some of the Android Tablets allow for this and if you find yourself wanting to use your tablet as a standalone storage device this might be something to consider. The device can read from certain flash drives though, but is largely limited to photo and video files. Jailbreaks offer solutions to this, but those come with their own issues as well.

Still no dedicated SD card slot. This is troublesome on two fronts. First, if you want to import pictures from your camera you have to have an adapter which is just one more thing to carry around. Second, the lack of expansion means you're limited to what you purchase in terms of storage. I purchased a 32GB iPad last time and never filled it up completely, so for me capacity wasn't an issue. If you want to be able to have your entire movie collection with you though... you may want to consider whether the iPad 2 can meet your space requirements.

HDMI output. Really this is a Pro and a Con. The iPad does allow for HD output over HDMI but again it requires an adapter. All of these adapters are additional purchases for features that some tablets offer built in. This can be a pain, but then again if you're not likely to ever use HDMI Output then you're not paying for something you won't use.

No Flash Support. This is becoming less and less of an issue as the internet and web developers are moving away from Flash for many websites, but there are a lot still out there relying on Adobe's Flash to run properly (including a lot of web based games). Before you pick a tablet consider what kind of websites you frequent and try and determine if they are Flash driven or not. If they are you may really want to consider something from the Android offerings as it is expected that they'll have at least some Flash support.

If you're in the market for a tablet device the iPad 2 should definitely be on your short list. If you're uncertain it is always best to go and play with these things hands on first if you can. Best Buy is a good place for that, so are Verizon Stores since they have the Xoom and 3G iPad. Don't get pulled into the hype and mania that comes with an Apple release. They're exciting and new, and they're impressive enough to warrant some excitement, but it will die down and there will be other products that prove a strong competitor to the iPad 2. If you're looking for right now though, this is probably your best bet. I gave the device 4 stars, as I did the iPad 1. I did this in contemplation of the features offered by competitors that are absent from the iPad, most notably the requirement for adapters for USB/SD/HDMI. While these features are there, they aren't as convenient as in other tablets. With that in mind I firmly believe that the iPad more than makes up for this in usability, reliability, and design and in those areas far exceeds its current competitors."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"First things first: I consider myself relatively unbiased on Apple products. I received the original iPad as a gift (which I was able to return once I saw the iPad 2 announcement) and I have an old iPod 4th gen with color display which is still going strong after a few years, but aside from that I typically use Windows PCs and my phone is Android.

If you don't have an iPad, and you're trying to decide whether you want one or not, ask yourself: What will I use this for?

This is meant to be an overview for the uninitiated, since according to initial news reports, 70% of people who have bought the iPad 2 so far didn't own an original iPad.

Advantages:

If you want it for web surfing, a portable Netflix or other video screen, gaming, or FaceTime/Skype video chat, it's definitely adept at all of those things. I used to read books and magazines in my bed before going to sleep, and I still occasionally do, but now I've found that surfing with the iPad is just as convenient and relaxing.

The iPad is all about the apps, many of which greatly expand the native capability of the iPad. You can get Microsoft Office clones, remote desktop, second screen, calculators, alarm clocks, remote apps for cable boxes and disc players, and more. Some are free, many are not. I'll get into some of those a bit later, but keep in mind this isn't intended to be a review of apps. If you want to see what's out there, you can search the App store on the web or in iTunes. If you expect the iPad to be able to do something not in its specs, check the app store first.

The only difference I've seen with the iPad 2 is that now there are a few games out there that are optimized for iPad 2, or have improved iPad 2 modes. Lots of games are free and those that aren't occasionally go on sale. The only two I've bought are Scrabble HD and Dungeon Hunter 2 HD, both when they were $1 each. (I've played many more free ones.) I recommend both. Dungeon Hunter 2 HD is a great 3D game that tries really hard to be Diablo 2, with character classes, customization, and online play. It looks great and has never crashed or had a framerate stutter. The iPad 1 had problems with crashing and low framerates with games occasionally, and this version seems to be a much better gaming system. That's the only big difference I noticed between the iPad 1 and iPad 2 so far though.

For me, having a huge array of apps to play with, many of which are free if you don't mind ads here and there, and the convenience of being able to web surf without having to drag out my laptop makes this worth having. Plus the battery gets 8-10 hours on a charge, which is a far cry better than any laptop I know of. It's a great e-reader for airplane travel, even really long flights, though you can't use it on take-off and landing of course.

Wi-Fi performance is flawless and the range is excellent. More than once I've pulled up in the driveway and before I'm even in the house, I've heard my iPad's ESPN ScoreCenter app go off to inform me of a score. I can't speak to the 3G quality, though, as I don't have that model. Frankly, I don't think most people need it. If I'm out of the middle of nowhere and need the web for something, I'd much rather pull out my phone than the iPad. If you just have to use the iPad, tons of public places have Wi-Fi these days.

If you want to be able to print things, you might think at first that you need an AirPrint compatible printer. Fear not! A simple Google search for ""AirPrint any printer"" will show you how to configure your PC or Mac to broadcast its printers with AirPrint. I have Brother and Canon printers and they both worked with it. It took some time to download and install the AirPrint service and then configure printer sharing options on my network, but that was a far cry better than buying a new printer or an expensive printing app! Still, I've found that my printers occasionally disappear from the list, and the only way to get them back is to shut the iPad down completely and power it back on. Annoying.

Limitations:

The iPad 2 still doesn't support Adobe Flash. Some websites are adapting to this and adding HTML 5 video. Many aren't. Keep that in mind if you're a heavy web video user. I love to watch web shows like the Nostalgia Critic and the Angry Video Game Nerd, and most web show hosting sites are still in Flash. Also, some sites have flash menus, making them completely unusable to you if they don't have a mobile version. It's this that prevents the iPad from being a true laptop replacement, regardless of how much you spend on apps. I still end up having to fire up the laptop to use several websites I enjoy.

The screen is supposedly oleophobic but gets fingerprints all over the place in mere minutes of use. I find that extremely irritating. If you feel the same way, get a screen protector like the ZAGG InvisibleShield (though if you get that particular one, be VERY careful when you install it, it's extremely difficult to get it on there with no air bubbles). You will thank yourself when all it takes to clear fingerprints is one wipe, plus it protects from scratches to boot. To get fingerprints off the screen itself took vigorous scrubbing and left streaks, which needed isopropyl alcohol to remove. Also, in direct sunlight, the glare off the screen makes it hard to see. Add fingerprints to that and it's practically impossible.

Although the iPad 2 has two cameras, one on the front and one on the back, I haven't found much reason to use them other than for video chat. The cameras are terrible quality and the iPad 2 just isn't portable enough to drag around everywhere for camera usage. You can get an excellent digital camera for $150 or less, and most smartphones have much better cameras than the iPad has. Use one of those instead.

If you don't own a laptop, don't expect the iPad 2 to do everything a laptop will, especially if you plan on doing any work-related things. Office applications are not included. Pages, Numbers, and Keynote, which are like Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint respectively, are available for $10 each. I don't own them, but apparently they work reasonably well. However they are not 100% compatible with Microsoft Office documents, especially if you have more complicated formatting, macros, or animations that don't translate directly. Plus, the virtual keyboard is a bit more tiring to type on and definitely hinders typing speed. I average about 45-50 WPM on it, where I can get 80-100 WPM on a normal keyboard. You can be a little lazy with it to increase your effective typing speed, though; you can leave out apostrophes or required capitalization and the iPad will nearly always fix it. That also mostly takes care of my fingers occasionally hitting the wrong keys due to the lack of tactile feedback, but I still end up having to go back and fix words sometimes. Also, sometimes it fixes things that don't need to be fixed. It always seems to correct ""its"" to ""it's"", but what if I mean ""its""? I know the difference!

A lot of other features that you would expect a laptop to have are not here, though, or cost more. For example...
- You can give slideshow presentations or display video on external monitors, projectors, or TVs with it, but that will cost you $29 for a VGA adapter plus the price of a cable and DVI to VGA adapter (monitors or projectors), or $39 for an HDMI adapter plus the price of an HDMI cable (newer TVs), or $39 for a composite or component video cable (older TVs)
- You can transfer photos from a camera directly without having to use iTunes, but that will cost $29 for a camera adapter kit
- The iPad is terrible at file storage for things other than music, videos, photos and apps, and with no USB or SD card slot, can't easily use external storage. If you want to store documents or need external storage for anything you'll need a file management app to keep track of them, and an online cloud file storage service like MobileMe (expensive) or Dropbox (free but limited to 2 GB, or pay for more)
- Where you can just close a laptop to protect its screen, you'll need a case to protect the iPad. I highly recommend getting one. To save some money, try a cover/case intended for iPad 1, assuming you don't care that the rear camera will be covered up. A lot of them still fit and work great, such as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Griffin-Elan-Passport-for-iPad-Black/dp/B003CKAQ7M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Griffin Elan Passport for iPad - Black</a>, and since they're for an old model they'll be discounted
- You can watch videos/TV episodes/movies on it, but unless you bought them in iTunes, it's a big fat pain to find a converter for them and transfer them to iTunes. This is especially annoying for DVDs/Blu-Rays that have digital copy. You've already paid for the movie and have a digital file but you can't transfer it to your iPad without having to jump through a ton of hoops or buying expensive programs or apps! Not all media companies have this problem, though. When you redeem a digital copy from Disney, you can choose to get an iTunes version, which is perfectly compatible with the iPad. I have Up, Toy Story 3 and Wall-E, and getting them on the iPad was hassle-free. Conversely, Warner Brothers only offers Windows Media versions of the Harry Potter series for digital copy. Transferring to iPad is possible but you need to find programs that remove the DRM, resize to iPad resolution, and convert to Quicktime format. Good luck with that.

Despite all that, the iPad 2 is worth getting if you can spare the cash, and more importantly, if you anticipate actually using it. I don't think it's worth getting for games alone, but if you're a gamer, there are lots of great, cheap games out there. Many of them are even multiplayer, though I haven't tried it, since most of my friends don't have iPads and interoperability between iPad and iPhone versions of games is slim to none (board games like Scrabble and Carcassonne tend to support iPad/iPhone interoperability though).

The thing is, though, I got this as a gift. Would I have gotten it if I actually had to plunk down the $500+? Honestly, probably not. The lack of many features without having to buy expensive apps and accessories is a real deal-breaker for me (and subtracts a star from my rating). Plus, though I understand why Apple doesn't like Adobe Flash, they really need to get over it since there are large parts of the web that don't work without it. It may be bad for battery life, but why not just have the option to turn it on and off as needed, then? Still, if money is no object for you, it's a slick, entertaining device, and you'll enjoy it quite a bit. Just don't expect it to replace anything you already have; the iPad is in a niche market that the iPad itself created."	4	electronics

They're exciting and new, and they're impressive enough to warrant some excitement, but it will die down and there will be other products that prove a strong competitor to the iPad 2.  If you're looking for right now though, this is probably your best bet.  I gave the device 4 stars, as I did the iPad 1.  I did this in contemplation of the features offered by competitors that are absent from the iPad, most notably the requirement for adapters for USB/SD/HDMI.  While these features are there, they aren't as convenient as in other tablets.  With that in mind I firmly believe that the iPad more than makes up for this in usability, reliability, and design and in those areas far exceeds its current competitors."	4	electronics

B0013FRNKG	The one I received appears to have been pre-owned, which I knew was a possibility. A small dent along the edge was the only hint. The other iPads in my extended family receive that kind of damage only through dropping on a hard surface. Well worth the very reasonable price ($150) It has functioned quite well. My granddaughter has enjoyed it immensely.	4	electronics

B0013FRNKG	iPad fine, but the charging cord wouldn't plug into the tablet, it was too big. Disappointing that it couldn't be used at once until we'd got a new charging cord.	4	electronics

B0013FRNKG	This is the first tablet I've had.  It arrived quickly and was very well packed.  It runs a little slow at times, but I didn't want to spend more for an Apple tablet, so I'm happy with it.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Wife is enjoying it!	4	electronics

B0013FRNKG	Item had scratches where someone had carved their message , however we understand we were purchasing a used iPad  . it works just fine and we are pleased .	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	One of the Best Used IPad I have brought. at the time the price was $101. At that price you'll be a fool not to jump on it. further more its a great ipad to say you have one. It's not heavy, came with IOS 9 , wasn't that badly damage and comes with a charger. Again like I said great introduction into the apple family. Really pleased with the service.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Just got connected. I am sure it will be something very useful	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Good condition except for a little crack on the side. Other than that like new.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I very much recommend this device especially if it's just for a simple person to do regular things. I bought it for my step- daughter and she likes it. At first I was a little worried she might not like it because it's an older generation but I don't think she cares as long as it's an iPad. Good luck!	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	still working just fine	4	electronics

B0013FRNKG	Can't argue Apple makes good quality products, even if they don't change much with their updates.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I just received the iPad 2 that I bought for my little brother and he can't put it down. Not a single scratch and it was in great condition! It came with a charger and black leather case as advertised. I tried to purchase another one for myself, but it was sold out :(
Thank you DDR products!"	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Also I cracked the screen about a year ago, it was still in excellent condition at a fairly good price. Thanks again for your service.	4	electronics

B0013FRNKG	Gets little glitche some time but other than that I'm happy with it	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I bought this to replace my other iPad 2, because the top button on it was malfunctioning.  I was pleased to find this replacement used iPad for such a low price.  I now have a functional iPad again, without having to shell out $300 for the new iPad Air.  I was disappoined in two things, though.  This iPad doesn't have retina display(my old one did), and the ad for the iPad wasn't at all clear on this issue.  Other than that, the battery of this iPad continually loses its charge if you put the brightness all the way up.  My old iPad didn't do this either.  Overall, though, I'm happy to still be able to have access to a decent iPad, without having to shell out another 300 bucks.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Very nice I-Pad.  in good condition and all of my apps transfered very well.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Great	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	was not in box. If its new where is the box?	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I don't use it nearly as much as I thought I would but it is great for what I have used it for (aircraft navigation (with an external GPS), email, and streaming from such places as Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime)	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Had to use my own charge. The one that came the the product didn't seem like a Apple charge and didn't work effectively. Other than that... So far so good !	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Great purchase. I would buy it again.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I just received my ""Used"" ipad 2 today. Wasn't sure what to expect. Not everyone is going to get a good tablet. Some will have more scuffs, dents and scratches and some may not operate properly. This looks to be in very good condition , as described.  It came with a wall charger in a plain white box. The set up was so easy. I did not need to use a computer to connect to itunes. Yay! That was a concern to me as I now own a Chromebook.  I never had luck with anything refurbished. My son's ipad 2 just broke and I wanted a cheap replacement, until he gets the mini for Christmas.  For  a little over $100, it seems to be in good working order. The apps seem to open at a slight touch. No delay detected yet. Its only our first day using it. It came 75% charged. I love Apple products. I owned many tablets such as Samsung and I keep coming back for an Apple.  Give it a try. If you are a Prime member, you can return at no cost if unhappy."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Alright product overall, but the system runs slowly at times and freezes up. Like for instance when I'm typing on the keyboard the letters have a slight delay from the time I hit the keys to when they show up on the screen. Overall decent product considering it's refurbished,	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	it arrives looking like 75-80% new.  Still holding charge, but I have had to actually to measure how long (hours) it is holding charge.  So far so good!	4	electronics

B0013FRNKG	Met my expectations. Seems to work fine this far. Did have a little chunck of a side corner missing but after putting a good cover on it it should be fine. Out of sight out of mind kind of thing. For the price I'm satisfied '	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Fast shipping. Works as expected. Battery life is okay, but this expected when you buy a used product. When it arrived it felt and looked brand new. I would buy from this seller again. Overall very pleased!	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	All my family members love to use this,easy and fun. But it is a little heavy when hold it in hands to read some news.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I bought this iPad refurbished and I have to say I am more than happy with my purchase. The screen and back were virtually brand new and it works great. The only complaint that I have is that the battery is a little weak. I get about 1% with 3-4 minutes of casual use.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Arrived on time, great quality, pleased with purchase.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	iPad was delivered as advertised: no screen scratches at ALL, no dents or scratches to the item at all, in good working order.	4	electronics

B0013FRNKG	a little slow but what do you expect from a gen 2. the ipad came flawless tho no scratch on the screen 1 small scratch on the back. overall great for what I use it for	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Trouble with speed of this product. Not sure why	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This iPad is several generations old, but it came with 64Gb and I believe that it is a better value than a newer version with only 16Gb which was near the same price.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	After having a Samsung tablet, this one resulted to work much bertter.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	It came with a case, which was a nice surprise...it was in really good condition too...the only minor issue was that the charger port is slightly bent, making it more difficult to fit the charger...	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	delivered as promised!!!  Have to get used to Apple products to say more, but they are well respected.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Still Going strong!!!!!	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I'm really liking this product Though the damage was more than I expected for having a ""like new"" rating. with two dings left pointing inward, I'm sure the screen was replaced as it was a refurb, they could have filed it down or straightened out the dings so close to the screen if it's ever dropped in that same place it will surely go directly into the screen. I filed it down some as it was catching the skin, very sharp. It's an older Ipad so it's not as responsive and quick as the new ones. But still a great product. For the price I'm very pleased! Reduction in stars due to the damage on the case being left as is. It's right there by the screen almost touching it already.. Of Course this one is mine with that unique problem, it doesn't say anything about the product, but does scream the repair person didn't pay attention to detail would have taken a couple of minutes to do the job right."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I have very little experience with the world of the Apple. I bought this tablet to meet the needs of some of my adult students. It works fine. I'm not giving it five starts because of my lack of experience with this OS.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Reasonable price compared to airs and met my needs	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Great item	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The iPad works great.  Bought it for my wife on our anniversary and she is very happy with it.  My only negative comment would be on the length of time in shipment.  It took 10 days from time of order to delivery.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Although the item itself is great, it was not correctly described. In addition to Wi-Fi, it's also 3G capable. I am not using the 3G function so it constantly displays a ""no SIM card"" message. I would not have bought it had the description been accurate since it was never my intent to use it with 3G."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Like all smartphones and tablets, the whole front of this is glass. Don't drop it on a hard surface and not expect the screen to shatter. After a few years of abuse, mine finally did.

 I don't work for Apple, I don't own Apple Stock. As a matter of fact, I was anti-apple for years. I finally jumped over to the iphone recently. I believe using this ipad had a lot to do with that decision.

The white seems to be better on the eyes than the black. My 1st gen, was black. I feel more fatigued when looking at that screen for long periods of time compared to this white one. The iPad 2 is pretty thin and light. I like its tapered edge, which feels more comfortable than the bulky original ipad. For a tablet device designed to be held, that's a pretty big deal. Apple really has done a pretty good job at fitting better components into a smaller space than before. In addition to the tapered edge, Apple managed to reduce the overall weight of the iPad 2. That might not seem like a huge deal to most, but the weight difference is surprising by the end of the day. The first generation is heavy and bulky compared to the 2nd gen."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I like it	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	My 1st issue is that the plug & charger were a joke. The Lightning charging cord wouldn't insert in either direction & on my 3rd try it went 1/2 in & broke as I pulled it out. I went to Apple Store & spent $19.95 for a cord. Then I tried to plug the board into the plug it came with & it didn't work at all.  Fortunately I was able to use the new cord w my iPhone plug.  SO - one of the main reasons I decided to buy this refurbished ipad2 from this vendor was that I could save all the expense of buying chargers - Nope!  BTW, the cord & converter were both brand new, cheap knock off brands.  As far as the refurbished iPad2 - it's ok I guess.  It looks new, clean screen & it is exactly as described - it's good for email, internet search, pintrest, YouTube - I'm not a gamer so not sure about that.  Takes a long time to charge (several hours) & gets very slow if I have too many apps - so I deleted FB app & a few others. I wish I had bought something newer w hi-resolution, but this is ok - except the charger thing wasn't cool.  Don't let ur buying decision be based on that - just plan to go buy them at Apple Store or use ur iPhone charger if it will fit.	4	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"I am not a fan of Apple products for various reasons. Last year we purchased a Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 10 inch tablet for my son. He would play math games and other educational apps. He would also download apps to play and he stated that they would ""lag"". The tablet had 64 MB of memory and it should not be doing that. We just purchased a 128 MB card for his tablet to see if that helps. He had been wanting a Ipad for a while, several of his friends at school have one and it seems to run smoother in his eyes. His gran bought him one this Christmas and he is in heaven! he has downloaded several apps and no lagging."	4	electronics

B0013FRNKG	it ok	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Still got life in it, as late as November 2015, due to Apple's great support (releasing iOS 9 for it). Probably won't get an update to iOS 10, but apps should still run under 9 for a couple of years even after the iPad 2 is no longer getting updates. Recommended for your toddler, they love these things, and it will get your phone back from him or her. Kid games will probably still run for 3-4 years, by which time your 2 y.o. is a a 4-5 y.o. and deserves your then-old iPad Air.	4	electronics

It came with an Apple phone charger instead of a tablet charger which took it a whole day to charge to 100%. I had to pay $30 at the Apple store to get the right charger for it on top of what I had already paid for the iPad. Other than that I was happy with the purchase.

B0013FRNKG	"I decided to buy the apple I pad 2 tablet second generation. I use the Internet frequently and walking around with my laptop was too much.  I decided that buying an I pad would be easy on the go.

Ive had apple products in the past; the programing has always worked perfect because its easy and simple. I have had previous apple product break easily. So, buying the product put me a little on edge. However Ive had the devise for about five months and I haven't had any problems with it. I have younger sisters who frequently play games on it and theyve dropped it several time. It still in perfect condition, I bought a case for it and they are extremely affordable compared to retail price.

Ive enjoyed my I pad because its easy to use. I bought one of the oldest versions of the I pads; however, being able to update helps me with what I need. The only big difference I see with my older I pad compared to the newer I pads is that its heavier and the picture quality isn't the best. I bought the product used, but in perfect condition. If you're looking for something simple and to get the job done, I pad 2 generations will do it!

Delivery
My I pad took a longer than expected to arrive; however with Amazon you can easily track your orders so you know where it is at.  The delivery date was only a couple days later. Also, Amazon has a great return policy if the product doesnt work."	4	electronics

B0013FRNKG	I like all, it's worth the price!	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Boss asked for one, way better price than the OEM sellers, and he can't tell the difference. Good for uninitiated iPad users! Don't destroy the best of the rest when training. ^_^	4	electronics

B0013FRNKG	I bought this used.  What can you expect???	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	works perfect as apple should	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	It is a little slow....so I am giving it a chance to see if is going to be ok.....	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I bought this for my family when it first came out. It has been a long time and this thing has survived 3 small children. It is a little heavier then a lot of the other apple products out now and it does not have a huge high res screen but man this thing is solid and is still a rock star. The only thing that has been affected so far is really the speakers. They aren't nearly as loud as my iphone 6 plus but overall this is a great product. This is why Apple charges what they do, this product still looks great and works great. A lot of the complaints I have have been addressed in the new models but I do wonder how sturdy they are compared to this one.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Great buy! Although it came with a crappy charger	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	It's perfect I like it my boy friend take it from me beacause he like it only one thing I cannot see where the sim go	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I read the description and it is what it is. Impressed with the seller. I would recommended	4	electronics

B0013FRNKG	Great price!	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	the mans ring loved it	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Definitely 100 times better than the cheaper droid tablets that I have had before. My wife and my baby girl both love it and someday when I find one of the newer ones at a realistic price I will be upgrading.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Everything was great except it did not have a SIM card My grade is B+	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Works great a little more dinged up than I liked	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Very happy with my I pad.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I received it since three and it works great so far. I know it said used but they are a lot of scratches and other signs that show it fell on hard ground a lot, it's all over the tablet but it works well so far I hope it will stay like that	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Hard to define 'GOOD"" condition - which was how it was advertised.  It had a scratch on the back.  It did have IOS 7 as advertised.  It booted fine, upgradeable to IOS 8.  Had charger and cables ... so for the price it was a bargain.  Only complaint isn't about the product, but how to define ""GOOD"".  Other than the scratch on the back, which is easily, this was excellent."	4	electronics

B0013FRNKG	Bought for my daughter and she loves it. She had a Kindle before and likes this better.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	In great condition. Would recommend this to others .	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	It has been very beneficial for my children.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I would have left five star rating , except for one detail .....the screen has a permanent stain , discoloration, splotch on it . Constantly trying to clean it off to no avail ! Other than that , it's perfect , I love it ( Personally , even with the splotch , I can live with it )! Real good value for the $$$.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Works good. Just a small indent in a corner. Even though Inew it was not New.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Bought one for my wife as a Christmas present. Hard to get her to part with her laptop though; she's still using it more than the IPad. The only exception is on long trips from CLT down to NOLA, she does enjoy being able to Facebook, Email, Kindle, etc. on the road with a $30/month upgrade to our AT&T cellphone account. That's something which she could -NOT- do with her laptop, except at the occasional roadside stop with a public WiFi connection..	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I received my device in the time frame promised and the IPad is in excellent condition.  I am very happy with my purchase.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Great for what I use it for. Thanks.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I ordered this for a friend.  She is very happy with it.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Several family member already own these. This one was gifted to my mother-in-law. Well built, nice design and interface, easy to use.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I have a problem with my iPad. It just now. My key pad spilt. Can someone please tell me what's wrong? How this can be corrected?
Sencerly,

B0013FRNKG	I love this thing. The problem is- there are no covers that exist for it yet. So, be warned covers of any sort are not out from any manufacuer including Otterbox. But it, enjoy it at your own risk. I checked Otter Box, Life Proof, Casemate, and many more and none of them have cases released yet.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Received this product as it was described.  Very satisfied.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Works just fine.  My husband enjoys having the ease of having the iPad on his bedside, and the simplification of getting to the information that he needs it for.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	It was fine.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I really like my iPad ..learning alt of things I can do..but I still haven't received my warranty papers.please let me know about this problem asap	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The iPad worked as expected.  My wife loves it.  The condition of the iPad was extremely good for a previously used item.  Packaging was sort of suspect as the box was simply put into an over-sized bubble bag.  The corners of the box were pretty damaged upon arrival, but fortunately the iPad worked fine.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	It is easy to use and loading appa is a quick process.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Happy	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Product works great!!!	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I got it earlier then I thought I would.  It works fine.  I wish it would of had some directions with it tho.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	What can you say. it speaks for itself	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Pretty cool	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I have debated whether to give it three stars or four. Only because I supposedly bought it new and it came ""like new"" i decided to keep it because it was after all $250. I have been really impressed with it and it works great. So if you are like me and don't like spending $500-$600 for an electronic then this is a good deal."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Product came just as described on site. Very pleased.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I did not order my iPad off amazon I just had to let you guys know that THE CAMERA ON THE IPAD 2 HAS VERY BAD QUALITY.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I love it.  It was well worth the money and arrived promptly.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Great pickup at the price	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I like this, I know this is a product that everyone seems to want but to me it can't compare to my android tablet.  Compared to my Samsung Galaxy Note it's a non starter.  I got it for work only because one of the companies I work with doesn't support android tablets.  They have now upgraded their app and now it runs very slowly and not efficiently on the iPad.  I have other tablets that are also superior to this iPad.  I thought when I purchased it, albeit reluctantly that I would be seeing the gold standard in tablets and was thoroughly disappointed.  It's ok.  Maybe newer versions are better I can't comment on that.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	It Was Like He Said It Was	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Good performance and looks good. And recommended to buy	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Only thing I didn't like that it didn't come in the original box. I have no owner manual. So makes me think if this is legit.  Everyone asked me if it was stolen.  So I don't think I would do this again.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I absolutley love my purchase, it work great, has a few little scuff on the corners, but was in great condition. Still using it till this day and I have no complaints. I would definitely order from here again.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Very fast shipment but product seems to be glitchy. Won't stay connected to my wifi in the next room over! and all of my apps move slow as molasses.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Very happy with this I pad. Does everything I need. Condition great!	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	too expensive	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	When I got it ,it wouldn't charge  I called Amazon and they said they would call limitless and they would call me in 48hrs and they didn't,t. I bought a new charger and also headphones don,t work in it.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This is a Christmas present for me,  I'm sure I'll like as I'm using an iPad 1st gen now.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This will make the perfect Christmas gift	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	it work well.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	What more needs to be said?  This is a product that works best when it uses a phone network and won't have to rely on the lazy and lax network of American Wi-Fi, but it's still damn good. Perhaps someday they will put a USB port in for use with thumb drives, but if they keep getting thinner, don't count on it.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	As described works good	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Very pleased working great.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Good thus far	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"This was a fantastic tablet. I purchased this tablet when it was released. It is awesome! However, now that I have upgraded to the iPad Air, I see that this one is out of date now. The functionality of it is great for everyday use, but if you want an HD tablet that runs like lightning, this one is not for you. It is very heavy compared to newer iPad models and the screen is not nearly as scratch resistant.

Overall, this was a great tablet in it's day but can't compete with the newer generations. The price is still very high, I would recommend the iPad mini over this model."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Awesome! My husband loves it!,	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This was an amazing amazon purchase. Great price on a great tablet. The seller posted that it was new. However, it did look a bit used, but that's okay. It runs well, and I use it exclusively for some educational programs. So far so good.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Works very well, so far no problems ..my  iPad was stolen and this one works excellent	4	electronics

B0013FRNKG	Got my iPad in two days and for used condition it looked great. Only two little nicks. Great price for an iPad 2. I love it.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The item shipped fast and is exactly as described. Works perfectly fine and is like new, except that the charger that came with it was obviously used and worn. The cord had a cut place in it, showing the wires inside. We threw it away and just use one that we already had.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"It was my first experience with buying something off Amazon. I bought this iPad because I needed a tablet that I could use for general college use and watching streaming video.

As of today, it's my 4th day with this tablet and I enjoy it! I bought it off Amazon, used, in ""Acceptable"" condition. Because it was used there was a significant discount, but of course I felt trepidation. I worried that it would arrive cracked, or otherwise in substandard condition. However, when it DID arrive the only nicks were minor and near the charging port, as well as some tiny sticky residue on the back (like someone had removed a sticker). Everything else was working fine: the home button was responsive, the speaker and microphone functioned well, and after a brief syncing with my iCloud, all my photos and contacts were imported with relative ease. There was a charger included as well!

The tablet is lightweight and intuitive. Of course, I am buying a case and screen protector to keep my investment safe. But my first buying experience with Amazon was great, and so far this ""Acceptable"" condition tablet has been preforming fine."	4	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"This was for my wife, to be fair I am anti-apple so keep that in mind in the review.

Pros
She loves the tablet it has worked well for 4 years. Still works when dropped and screen cracked. Very easy interface.

Cons
Does not have usb and everything on the apple store is over priced. Cannot change battery. Unable to open most work websites due to safari not being compatible.  Need to load itunes on a real pc to update and backup. Cannot window apps. Only one app open at a time."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Good fulfillment. Product exactly as described, delivered in a timely fashion. Packing is fine, too. I have purchased this product before, and I will buy it again from Amazon.	4	electronics

http://5b797okgvjtewv5mo4o1yos111.hop.clickbank.net/"	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Bought this item because of the great price. I didn't mind that it was 3 years old, I just wanted a nice tablet that I can browse the internet on because my 2008 is getting slow and can't run multiple programs at once, which makes it difficult to use iPhoto and/or photoshop while online. So after I bought it I was really looking into the reviews and thought it was odd how long and detailed the reviews were. I clicked on the one star reviews and got a bad feeling. Most of them were how they bought it labeled ""new"" but it was damaged or something was wrong with the system, or that they got it extremely late. I started to think the 5 star reviews were spam and it was a big scam and noticed some of the accounts said the same thing on multiple items. My delivery date came and went and was really worried I wasted my money. The next morning it came, and i was happy it wasn't at least extremely late. I got it ""packaged sealed"" and opened it up. Noticed it didn't have the plastic on the iPad itself like it should but there was no defect physically. It also started up with iOS 7 which is not right considering its a 3 year old iPad. But thankfully it's working great and looks brand new. I don't know if it's with every iPad purchased here or I was just lucky, but I've been using it for 3 days straight and it's been working amazing. Hope this helps."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	A gift for my 80+ year old Mom.  She is learning her way around it pretty easily.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I bought this product used about 2 years ago. The description of the condition was accurate and the product functioned like new. No complaints! Well worth it for the price I paid, and all it had was one small scratch on the screen that didn't bother me one bit in 2 years.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"exceeded my expectations and sent to me very professional like.

Thank You"	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I purchased an IPad reluctantly as I am trying to get away from Apple products.  Unfortunately I needed an IPad for work since the software my company was using for a project only ran on IPads.  I wanted to spend as little as possible but still get a quality device.  I purchased a refurbished device on Amazon from Instant Replay Electronics (Instantreplayelectronics.com).  It worked fine at first however that quickly changed.  I was having trouble with connecting and staying connected to wifi.  I was in a jam because I had a 30 day warranty from the seller and my meeting where the IPad was required was coming up in a week.  I corresponded with Shane from the seller and was told that they would ship the replacement the next day after they received it.  To their credit, they did just what they promised and I had the IPad for my meeting.  Although I wish the product would not have needed to be returned (I never had good luck with refurbished items), I was pleased that the seller did as promised.  If you are looking for a cheap IPad but are concerned about getting a lemon, this seller stands by his word.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I was hesitant to buy a used device, but it arrived as advertised, in great shape.  Works excellently.  My son uses it for games and this fall will use it for school.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	VERY NICE!!! VERY EASY TO WORK WITH.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I bought this iPad and am pleased with it, however... The charger that it came with is not an apple charger, it works but takes hours and hours to fully charge.. I used my sons apple charger and it charged in 4 hours, therefore I am going to buy an apple charger and cord myself.  19.99 each...  Sooo if you buy this iPad, you should plan on paying another 40.00 to get a charger that works...	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Gift for my Husband, he loved it, works great.	4	electronics

B0013FRNKG	I got it for my daughter as a graduation present from high school.  She is loving it and plans on using it when she goes to college in August	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The Ipad was exactly as described but the accompanying leather cover was very worn and fit very poorly. It had to be discarded and a new one bought.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	So far my son hasn't had ANY ISSUES with this. It came in factory packaging just like all my other products purchased directly from Apple. Wifi works on his new 16gb+Verizon iPad great. I can't tell you about the Verizon connection yet because I have not connected him to the Verizon network yet. I'll keep you posted. This was purchased through Amazon - sold by The Raisin King but shipped by Amazon. My son's iPad seems to be 100% legit. Now we have 5 total Apple products in my household and they all work perfectly.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I'm so in love with my iPad!!! The only thing that is not the greatest is the camera. I know the iPad Air has a awesome camera.	4	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"This is less of a review and more of a heads up. Apparently the seller ""Pavilion Electronics"" here on Amazon is selling return/refurb iPads as new. I just discovered this as I called Apple support on the 1st of 2 iPads I have purchased off of Amazon when the touchscreen stopped responding. Apparently it was registered with Apple almost 6 months prior to my purchase of it putting it out of warranty early (at least as far as my purchase is concerned). So, I now have to pay $270 to get it replaced after year of light use in a church environment (5-6 hours a week)."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	It has a few glitches. At first on the internet I was not able to add the next page. It just started working.  And I don't like the fac that it didn't come with a calculator	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Just got this for my Aunt- it's brand new, packaged, sealed, wrapped- perfect!  Could have used bubble wrap due to what was inside the box.  Seller listed as WIFI- but it says Verizon on the screen.  Trying to fix that now- but otherwise listed as promised, not a knock off, real deal. Thank you!	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This was the non retina version, and I swapped it out for the retina version. I like that one better...but it does feel slower(?) could be the updated OS as well?	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Just perfect for introducing my 87 year old mother in law to the world of the internet. She can't put it down.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Although it was a refurbished item but it was like a new one. most of all was that it was cheap too.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I've never owned a tablet before.  No instructions included so guessing has not got me far.  I probably didn't pay for them.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	It is exactly what we thought it would be and love it.  My wife is loving it very, very much.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I was extremely pleased with this I-pad.  It is exactly what I was looking for.and am thankful that I purchased it.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	A great computer but the machine is locked.  Some other wiser iPad users have suspicions about the origin of this 'used' computer.  All I want is directions or help in unlocking.  What I can do on it is very good?	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I like it, but there is a learning curve to use it. It came with NO instructions and I needed some.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I didn't need the newest tech. IPad 2 works for what I needed to do. I'm very happy with it, although I would have liked to spend. Less on old tech no longer in production. Ah we'll, it's good enough for now.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I'm never on the cutting edge of technology.  But now that I have it, don't know how I lived for so long without it.  Love all the apps.  Only problem is, I can't stop using it.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Once I got the iPad wiped clean and got a charger everything was great. It did come with a case, which I didn't  expect so it was a nice surprise. I feel I got a great deal. In fact a colleague ordered one for himself.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This IPAD was bought as a replacement for an IPAD that my son accidental broke.  Even though it was an accident, the school made us replace it so I really don't know if it worked and really don't care.  Thanks for having one available.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	iPad, iPhone, i anything we know it will always be of a high caliber, as always :) only issue I have with this model is it's non-support for Siri.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I bought a refurbished iPad 2 and expected dings and scratches.  In fact, part of the frame has a dent in it that looks like the device was dropped.  Overall though it functions well and I am enjoying it very much.  New iPads are grossly overpriced, so I do recommend going with still somewhat overpriced refurbs... this one was $250.  Satisfied overall.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Somewhat expensive, but great. No problems yet. My kids and wife enjoy using it all the time. All the application are running well.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	An excellent product delivered in a timely manner. I bought this iPad for my wife who is a computer novice and she is having a ball with it searching the web and Emailing friends..	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I purchased this as a gift for my little sister and she absolutely loves it.
Biggest issue which is probably pretty big is the resolution of the camera... No product should carry .92 mega pixels! Really Apple?"	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This I Pad works great for everything I need to do and you can still get all the apps you want. You can surf the internet, check your e-mail, read from Kindle or Barnes and Noble, play cool games, take and store photos, and much more. So if you can do without Android, this is an economical way to go.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This unit was in great shape, it looked new and works great. It came in a white box just for the iPad with a charger and cord. I think I will buy more this way. Thanks	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Because this was a first tablet, I went back and forth between this and an iPad Air. The cost was the final reason. I am enjoying it very much.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	My I pad is great and in good condition and works like if I bought it new and I love it.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I am primarily an Android and PC user, so I was a bit hesitant picking up a tablet made by Apple. The reason I am giving this product 4 stars over 5 is because of the lack of usb/SD support. There is absolutely no excuse not to have these ports available. For those of you who don't care, take this review as 5 stars. I found myself needing those ports, but the applications are fantastic. Being a college student, I use Pages, voice recorder, and goodnotes the most, which, by themselves, are amazing applications that help me get through classes with little stress. This thing helps me manage my life, so consider me polytheistic in terms of technology. I love my PC, Galaxy III, and iPad 2 all very much for what they offer.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Second iPad purchase. Should of chose 32 gb memory. Surprised by how quickly memory filled up this was however not a problem with the actual product. Ipad was exactly as described.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	If you need a tablet but don't want to spend lots, getting a used model of quality makes sense. This Apple I Pad works great and has double the GBs of similarly priced items by lesser known brands.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Still learning...can I get movies on my iPad by using. iTunes?  Please let me know....thanks.  Otherwise going well. So far......	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I went to set up my son's birthday presant.
Instructions say turn on and follow instructions. That did not happen.
Called for help...another $200.00 later it's going great.
Would have liked to known this when I made the purchase!"	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	WORKED GREAT BEFORE UPDATES NOT SURE WHY UPDATES MAKE IT WORK WORSE, A LITTLE ANNOYED ON HOW UPDATES MAKE ELECTRONICS THIS HARD TO OPERATE!	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	It  was what i expected. Very nice and in excelent conditions. I recomend it. the bad thing is that some programs aren't compatible whit apple	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Since it was previously owned have had some trouble.  Will be getting help soon.  Bought a iPad book for seniors:)	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Purchased as a Christmas gift for my son, he really liked it and is enoying it. I would do it again when the time comes.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I like the iPad 2 but I thought it was new and it was not. I found someone's info. On it and the screen is dim and I can't figure out how to brighten it or if in-fact it can be lighted. I shouldn't have to take a new product to the apple store.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	It has had some mechanical issues and has already had to be taken in to be fixed. It wasn't updated. Still giving me problems with fb connections when first turn it on...however, I am able to correct it ... but it has to be corrected each time I want to use it. Other than that it works well.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Every thing is great iPad showed up fully charged and start
 Up was easy . I need to get a military spec case for it and then I am ready to travel with it!,"	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Very user friendly, for what it's used for. Aesthetically pleasing, and the person that received it as a gift said it's ""sexy""."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This was a present for my wife for Christmas and she loves it. He already had a IPhone so she had no trouble figuring out how to navigate on the device. She loves it.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I ordered this for my 10 year old son for Christmas and he was thrilled! We bought the iPad 2 used, but it arrived on time packaged perfectly. The only problem was a charger wasn't included. There were some connectors of some sort but now for the iPad..	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The Ipad works just fine, but the calendar is in a foreign language (Danish?) and I have not found a way to change it to english, no matter how I try.  Any suggestions?	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Out of the box everything woks just fine. Exactly what I expected. Speed of the processor is fine and the screen resolution is very good.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Excellent product!  Great price and everything works well. Looks used with scratches and dents but still well worth it for the money!	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	the sale said it would have a charger  the box, but it did not, we got gyped. and want the charger, why would we buy a ipad with out a charger???? please send the charger as promised.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This iPad 2 was in perfect condition and works well, but I didn't pay attention to the fact that it is a Verizon iPad. It works for the intended purpose but we can't get it to sync with an iPhone, unfortunately. Still, it will do the job. Wish there were a way around the Verizon-thing.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	hope I don't jinx myself. it works and it looks great. cant tell its used. Got it for my10 yr old, whowanted an ipad but I could not justify spending $500 or more for a new one. Good price for this one, so I went for it.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Love the mini for browsing internet and checking email. Some websites don't work well with the browser so I still have to use a regular computer.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Like the size and easiness to use of the Ipad 2.  Arrived fast and was easy to set up.  Like to be able to carry with me without a heavy	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I liked it and it was in perfect shape.  The only thing was I had no directions on how to use it...guess I can google that.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I had an iPad for several years and I decided to buy this one for my wife. She like it so far.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Speaker inadequate; must use earphones to hear anything even with volume @ it's max. Otherwise I am very pleased with it.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	order your SIM card (through AT&T, Verizon, etc.) when you order this iPad, unless you don't mind waiting for it to arrive after your iPad does. I assumed it would've been included. but I'm not tech savvy.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Works great! Only a few scratches on the back. No problems so far. We'll see how long though. Charger that was sent does not work	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Pros: It's an Apple, you know it will work, you know it has great support and customer service, what is not to love.

Cons: It is a bit pricy but you pay for what you get. The only real con, and reason it is not 5 stars, is that we received a European power plug so I had to pay $4 to order a cheap replacement for it. No where in the description does it say non-U.S. or European plug.
Another thing that was not as advertised is that it keeps asking for a SIM card as if we bought one that could be put on a cellular network when the description clearly says Wifi and does not list a carrier."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	It is awesome great clarity and no problems at all I recommend buying a apple Ipad as soon as you can.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	It has all the features I was looking for in a tablet and for a used item it's in great shape.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I love my iPad. I am so lucky to have gotten it for work. I didn't see the point in getting a newer generation for me right now (i may at some later date) I struggled with getting used to the tablet aspect of it at first but it is seamless and easy to use. Everyone I know was always talking about how intuitive apple products are and now I finally understand what they meant. I do wish that it had some built in grip positions but I have a great case and keyboard now so I can't really complain!	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	As a first time user/owner of an iPad (and any Mac product), Ive quickly discovered what a marvelous tool it has become. I didn't know what I was missing. Having purchased a refurbished iPad, I am very satisfied with the quality and the looks of it.  I forget that it was refurbished.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Purchased this iPad for my son.  It works very well, screen has beautiful color and resolution.  My biggest complaint (this is more my fault for not researching the product before buying) is that what you buy as far as memory is what you get.  You cannot increase its memory like you can a computer.  We've had to delete video and apps over the past year to make room for more.  My son really hates losing apps from time to time, but we have to if he wants to make room for a new one.  Buy as much memory as you can afford, because after a few months you may find yourself stuck.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Seems to function well however i haven't used it extensively as it is a holiday gift.  There is a small chip on the right corner that i don't believe was mentioned in the ad.  I will need some type of a cover to hide it.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Overall this was a pretty good purchase. Some minor nicks on corners and screen had some minor scratches. I am happy with the purchase as very quick delivery.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Got this as second iPad to another household iPad 2 used in home schooling and kid's and spouse entertainment. I didn't need the better screen or extra weight of the iPad 3.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I loved it. I've had it for about 2.5 years and it's been great...though the Home button has lost it's sensitivity and I have to push it hard to register. I've heard others with this model have the same problem.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"As an android fan I found three things about the ipad that I liked
1) Battery life is PHENOMENAL
2) Some of the apps I use on android have better versions on the ipad (this is largely due to the OEM fragmentation of android and a more uniform OS and hardware situation with apple)
3) Lots of accessories

As an android fan I found a bunch of things I didn't like
1) Almost everything has to go through itunes/apple
2) No widgets/home screen customization.
3) No Amazon MP3 downloads
4) No CLEAR access to device flash memory.
5) Only apps from the apple app store can be installed
6) second hand google apps
7) Maps and GPS don't work WELL
8) No flash. (although there aren't anymore official android flash player updates. It can still be installed)
9) One app at a time (I'm spoiled by my note 2)"	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	ipad work perfect...tested with wifi, but not 3g yet, good look overall. no issues has found yet,,, we like it.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	just wanted a reader.  I got it because a friend had one.  I just had to get it.  Great value!!	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	My rating was based on the earlier iPad I had which was the next generation. Overall I was well pleased with it.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Nothing wrong with the iPad.  I am having trouble learning how to use it.  I found learning on the computer much easier.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Been waiting to find a low cost iPad - found this deal and it has been great. Upgraded to iOS 7 and it works great.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Just bought mine yesterday paid only 349.00 for it at Walmart. Save your money and get it there. So far I like but can't use java on it.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I rarely purchase used electronics especially computer type electronics. In this case I took a chance, even though I am not too savvy when it comes to an iPad or smart phones... To not have the knowledge on how the iPad functions has been a nightmare for me, and to date I haven't been able to sign in with Apple, WiFi, iTune or any of the major connections without Apple operating instructions... I will have to take it to an Apple Store to get it to set up.... My big complaint is that Operating Instructions are not included with the package. The people where I purchased the iPad are top notch, and I would recommend this seller to everyone, they really work with you as a consumer, and attempt to solve most challenges. Apple has the operating instructions on the Apple.com site, but they should include the instructions in writing for quick reference. That is not the fault of the seller I might add.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	iPad 2 was received when it said it would be. I would recommend to everyone. The iPad works great for me.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Pretty sure the power cord was designed to drum up residual income from off the initial purchase, plugging it in takes to much time, seems unreasonably difficult, and the cord too delicate. Now I know why iPad owners I know have had to order new cords. Otherwise, seemingly a perfect little machine.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I need to learn how to use the notes application and few other things on this but I love how handy it is to use when you're around the house and don't want to run to your computer to look things up online. My phone screen is too small to read most websites but the Ipad is perfect.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I use the ipad all the time and only give it four instead of five stars because there are newer better versions which I would love to get.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I tired years ago of trying to figure out the nuances of different computer systems. I love Macs, so why does this thing seem almost alien in comparison? From email to the internet, everything is similar but different at the same time. Perhaps if I used it as often as my home computer, I wouldn't be so clumsy with it. All that aside, it's a beautiful machine and wouldn't trade it for any other pad.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I think it had more scratches than divulged, and it bothered me that another brand cord was with it. I would have LOVED to have had a book/instructions with it, but I know that was too much to hope for;)
The store performed as promised with shipping dates. It was a good deal."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	OK, so I'm not exactly thrilled with the Apple hardware philosophy. You can't swap the battery, there's no way to expand the memory (it doesn't have a CF slot or accept a USB stick), and there's no resident filing system included in the OS. Still, the iPad has become the industry standard in aviation, the only platform approved by the FAA as an electronic flight bag.  And, replacing 30 pounds of paper charts (which have to be updated every 56 days) with a 1 1/2 pound tablet saves money, trees, and fuel. So, it's a no-brainer.  (I still wish I could swap batteries and plug in memory.)	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	First of all the case is not a 20 dollar case nor was the screen cover and add on you told me there was some light dents they are so heavy that the glass is about to fall out.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	best toy. correction, not a toy, a great learning tool, the thing is awesome this thing goes every where with us	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Okay so I ordered two iPad 2's, both refurbished one white one black. They came quickly, was very happy about that. As for the iPad's condition... The black one was great maybe a few scratches but factory rest complete and was very happy with this one. The white one on the other hand was covered in scratches and also no factory rest done. So when I got it there were someone's pics and other stuff. Both said they would come with a charger but neither did:( that was a big disappointment. That being said I called the company to complain about the condition oh the white iPad, they were very accommodating. They had no problem giving me back some of my money. And they did that in a timely matter. There was a credit to my credit card of 95.00 with in a few days. So over all happy with the company and yes would buy from them again:)	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	No complains on the delivery service. The device is very handy and at home is my 4 years son most favourite toy.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Item came on time. I ordered it for my dad and he seems to like it.
He carry it on him everywhere he go."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Accesses e-mail very quickly. I still do not understand all the features and wish I
could delete things more easily."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	My iPad is really nice and I am so happy with it but it dies stuck some time which makes me really sad	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Got it for my daughter when she was 2 yr old and we are still using it today.
I hope Apple will not discontinue it soon."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I purchaced the ipad2 for my sister so that we could facetime between UK and US as I already have one.  She said it is in very good condition and has no problems with it.
The only thing we have found so far is that when we are chatting via facetime hers does not charge or hold charge while plugged in, so as my battery life is going up, hers is going down.  It's not a major problem as if she calls when her battery is fully charged we have plenty of time to chat.
When her ipad is not in use it charges fine.
Overall I am very happy with the purchace."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	grandson liked it for his birthday...so I do too!  With the way it was refurbished for us...It fits the bill!	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Bought for husband,mainly to play games on. Sorry it wasn't 3G but it meets all his expectations. He likes the wifi feature.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I purchased the white iPad 2 + WiFi/3G from my local Apple Store in March of 2011 upon it's release.  At the time, I really felt like I was ""biting the bullet.""  I guess I just didn't think I would totally harness it's capabilities and only use it ""casually"" to write the occasional e-mail and surf the web.  To that end, I was right but as far as iPad generations are concerned, this device hits the sweet spot for what I use the tablet for (surfing the web, typing posts on Amazon, Tweeting and the occasional e-mail).  It's not too powerful for gaming per se but offers a silky smooth performance for business related functionality.  I even find that I don't need a BlueTooth keyboard as typing on it's screen in landscape mode is fast and easy enough.

The only disappointment I have is that I paid for the cellular antenna.  I find that I mostly use this device in the home as a quick means of accessing the Internet where a WiFi access point is readily available.  I also take it with me out-of-town and for the most part, most hotels offer free WiFi so the cellular aspect of this device was money wasted.

I am EXTREMELY pleased with this device's battery life.  It has been tested and found that the iPad 2 has the longest battery life of ALL the iPad generations up through the iPad 4 or ""iPad with Retina Display!""  I truly believe this iPad second generation is the ""sweet spot"" in Apple's iPad lineup and that is why the Cupertino company is continuing to offer this device for purchase.  You don't really need the ""retina"" screen or the extra 500mb of memory for business tasks such as surfing the web or writing an e-mail.  This device will work flawlessly for those tasks.

I can only express how happy I am that I purchased this tablet.  I will probably upgrade to the next iPad 5th generation, if it offers the robust WiFi AC and comes in an even slimmer, more elegant form factor.  I would recommend that users opt out of getting the cellular model unless they need to use the device in their cars for example.  I have a Garmin GPS, so this is a non issue."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Got this for my mom for Mother's Day this year. It arrived in a timely manner. The box was in perfect condition, wrapped in plastic. The product was exactly what it was supposed to be. Mom loves it, but she keeps calling it an iPod. No, mom. I didn't pay almost $400 for an iPod... although I feel like I did because all she does it watch YouTube on it.
Only lost a star because these things are so expensive. Really, unnecessarily so. But it's ok. Mom is happy."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Very good little computer but the battery life is not to long...  Also manual would help and cut down on guess work...

B0013FRNKG	The ipad came quickly, in great shape (only some small dents on the back) and works perfectly. If it wasn't for the dents, you would have been hard pressed to tell it was used. Good company to buy from and I recommend them.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I would not call it light years ahead of their prior version but it is still a nice unit.

the screen quality and the picture quality is astounding.

It has the usual ease of usability that we have come to love and apple has set the new standard in reliability.  HP can learn a lot from apple."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I won't use the camera on the iPad. That sucks. However, I've been really pleased with the capacity and speed of this device. I use it to edit photos as well as video streaming and Internet surfing. Great for all my networking needs.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I am not the iPad user.  I purchased it for a grandchild who does love it.  The product received was exactly as listed.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	she was very happy with it all her friends went home to tell there parents about it then they all called us	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	It works perfectly well. I prefer the apple iPad to any tablet in the market. I have bought for more than 6 people.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	There was a keyboard that came along with it but it was defective. When I contacted the owner, he stated that it was merely a bonus, therefore he couldn't fix.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I was skeptical about trying an Ipad because I have always used a windows based computer. The transition went smoothly. It has been very easy to adapt. Amazon was very good to deal with. I had a slight issue at first and customer service stepped up and fixed everything immediately.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	It is a good iPad and does everything thing a iPad needs to do.  I was so excited to get this that I did not notice that it was black, when we ordered white, till about a week later!  I wish it was white but black does the same thing as the white one does so we are fine with it.  I didn't send it back because we had it set up already.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The item was shipped faster than I thought and is in good condition. It came with the charger and cable as described but with scratches on the back which were pretty intense. Though if it's in the iPad cover  it can't be noticed coz the screen is in perfect condition. All in all the item was and still is good!	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	We love the product, despite the switch in color and would use this vendor again. It was as described in the advertising (except for the color switch).	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Hopefully less tech support issues.  I have an ASUS tablet myself and I found the iPad 2 touch screen to be sub-par by comparison.  Was much easier to set-up thought.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Fast and dependable. Easy to use.  Only down side is its not compatible with many down loads for listing to music online or silver lite which I needed for a website I was trying to take a test on.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Received sooner than expected! It was exactly what I expected. The price was great and I've had no problems with it.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"So far I really like it but unlike most people who are up to date with
computer technology I was not and so I would have like some instructions with
the I PAD to know how to get started, but had to ask quite a few people exactly
how to find things and get things set up. I am still learning from others how much
might be available to me, again a short tutorial or something would have been nice with the product."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"The iPad works great! The only issues I have is it is not comparable to get kindle books
on amazon.  Some of of my apps did not sync up together either but overall the IPad works really well and I have no other issues."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I'm new to the IPad but I'm finding it easier as I get accustomed it.  It takes time to figure out all the options,  I recommend it.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	As usual, Apple gives you a tool that does not fail. My only concern is its operative system: you are led to spend money with Apple every two strokes. The customizable past of the Mac is not present in this device.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Apple is the best ...bought the ipad for work does everything it was intended for ..great resolution fast response ..size a little annoying definitely will consider mini !! Better yet it paid for itself in its first week!!!!just by posting ads online ...dardin810@gmail.com ..email me and I can tell you how I paid for my ipad it's first week !!!	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The product arrived in better than expected condition.  Im only disappointed by the size of the memory.  Any home videos take up most of the memory not leaving enough room for any programs.  There's no way to transfer video off or plug a sim card into the device.  Thats Apple not the shipper's issue.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The touch screen worked reasonably well.  Needed to buy a screen guard to view the screen outdoors, but haven't had any other problems so far.  This was a refurbished unit, so there were some scratches on the case as advertised.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Not an Apple fan, but my daughter is. She uses her iPad more than her laptop now. She wouldn't know what to do without it.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	A Notation their safari flash plug in is not available;hence is a money maker for third party net surfing providers such as Firefox and Photom! I I almost venture my self buying flash from apps. good thing I did not, it does not help my video conferencing business. Until a patch is created by apple for it some of us will have to Mickey Mouse it.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I have always owned Windows operating PC's so this IPad 2 is a whole new experience for me.  I am venturing along with it & am now fairly comfortable with using it for basics.  I purchased it because it was available with Verizon  which I think will be a great way for me to use a computer when I travel without the need to seek a hotspot, somewhere.  I doubt that I will use it or any computer to run my life with but browsing, e mail & reading books on it is great.
I bought the IPad 2 rather than the newer model as my needs do not justify the additional cost just to have the latest model."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	We use for company purchase and like it!  like it, like it, like it, like it, like it, like it.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I was not sure if I would get what I paid for but it was more than I imagine! Thanks!	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"My primary reason for acquiring an iPad was for leisure and for work in the future.  I am currently a college student with plans to teach at the high school level, so I knew there would be endless amount of apps that will enhance my teaching in the future.  Right now, schools are exploring 1 on 1 iPads with their students because it makes it so much easier to grade and create assignments without the hassle of textbooks.  At home, I became sick of pulling out my four-year old Dell laptop to surf the web, watch videos, and just play around.  I wanted something that was smaller, easy to travel with, and it had to be a tablet.  Now, my Dell is fine for writing papers and all the other obligations that come with being a college student, but for an apple product as efficient and productive as the iPad, the price is tough to beat.  The iPad does not replace a desktop or a laptop, but it is a tremendous technological device that is user friendly and fun to play with.  Whether it is for leisure or work, there is an application for it.  What I like the most is that the ios apple system signals to the iPad when it is time for an update, making it up to par with the latest technology, which in turn betters its efficiency and productivity instantly.  With that being said, the ability to access the apple store is what sets it apart from other tablets.  Like I previously stated, there are apps for everything, and there are even several free apps that increase enjoyment and productivity.  It is a must buy for anyone interested in a tablet for both leisure and work obligations.

I also have an iPhone 4 which I use very religiously, and the iPad 2 is an extension of that for me.  There are fewer apps available for the iPad, but that's not saying a lot, as there are still thousands available for it, as I find myself searching for a new app daily on the apple store.

I have the 32GB edition and have not come close to filling up all the storage space!  I think it is the perfect size for somebody that doesn't constantly use it, but for someone that is on it daily at work or at home.  If you are going to count on it for everything you do in regards to a computer device, I would recommend the 64GB, but for me the 32GB has been great and I have not run into any problems to this point.  In addition, the device is very light, and you can hold it with one hand.  Definitely buy a protective case for your iPad, even though I have found it to be very durable.

It is very nice to be able to use it like a mini computer.  You can access your personal files via google drive, drop box, etc. to increase productivity and bring your desktop or laptop files on the road with you.  One nice feature is that you can view websites with a mobile display or desktop display, serving for the benefit of all users.  Powerpoints, Word Documents, and PDF's are easy to view with the tap of the finger, which is very beneficial for someone in the business world or still in school.

While I thoroughly enjoy my iPad 2, there are frustrations with it.  I find myself frustrated with the fact that I can't play Flash.  I like to watch videos, especially via twitter and facebook, and a lot of times I am unable to do so because of the software's inability to play flash.  In addition, I get frustrated because I wish I could make the iPad my only source of a computer.  I wish I could type on word and make a powerpoint as seamless as I do on my Dell.  I could do that, but on a college budget you don't want to be paying for an expensive app to make that a reality, but that's also the beauty of it.  You could download Microsoft Office products if you wanted to make it your go-to computer device.  One thing I would suggest is buying a keyboard for your iPad.  I went a year without one, but once I acquired a keyboard it made it that much more efficient to use!  So much easier to surf the web, iMessage, etc.

In essence, if you're having a tough time deciding on buying an iPad or not, I would highly suggest buying one.  Now, if it is between a MAC laptop and an iPad, go with the laptop.  But, if you are in the market for a tablet and are looking for efficiency and productivity with a tablet, the iPad is a much because of the apple IOS software and the thousands of applications available via the apple store.  The slick design with endless amount of possibilities to increase production with an iPad puts it a head above the rest.  Once you begin using an iPad, you won't regret the purchase."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This was my second iPad 2. After the first was stolen, I realized I couldn't live without it. I mostly use it for nursing school, but also like to stream videos and play some games on it. The only downfall I've found to buying an iPad over other tablets, is that it doesn't work with Microsoft Office. You have to purchase an expensive app to be able to work with those types of documents.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I like the screen great to watch football games and movies on.  I didn't buy my iPad but i know it was expensive $1,000! It has flaws its not a full fledged computer no usb and no typing applications so not for some how is in the market for a computer	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	We ordered an iPad to use for business transactions, and to show pictures of our products to customers. It was shipped on time, and came in good working order.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The ipad2 was in great condition and I am pleased with it but I would have liked to receive a wall charger with it.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"It was simple as A-B-C. The Ipad was in mint condition as mentioned and works perfectly.
Good deal for the price"	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The iPad works great, I have found no problems at all with it. I am so happy with the product. The only thing I didn't like was the packaging. The box was barely taped shut, I could stick my entire hand in the side of it. No bubble wrap was placed around the iPad box to protect from damages. I would have liked amazon to pay closer attention to their shipping boxes	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The ipad looks good ,but has few minor dings in back not mentioned, shipped recklessly : not properly packaged at all ,got supper lucky it didn't break or ... !!!	4	electronics

it met my expectations"	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Esta tabletas son una maravilla, fue para un regalo para mi novia y an no la puedo despegar de el una excelente eleccin, aunque recomiendo las que tienen 3G	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	It meets my expectations. It is really the brand I like and I feel very much comfortable using this one.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"That is why I chose it over the newer models. I also bought the camera adaptors which work just fine. I highly reccommend them
for those who want to load photos directly from a digital camera. Get a word processing App (I like Doucuments2) and you can load text/data also. I have not tried to transfer video directly from my video camera but I plan to see if that is possible. Glad I bought the 64GB model.
I have an i-Pod Touch for when I need a very portable  small, pocket size  lightweight device. However the battery life on the Touch is short compared th the i-Pad2. Of course one must have a laptop/desktop/printer for the heavier tasks. And now I have the i-Pad2 for medium size tasks with medium portability, increased functionality and plenty of pure digital fun/toy possibilities.  The operating system on this device is tried and true and by now has been tested over time. The screen and visuals are quite acceptable to these eyes. If you need more in terms of visuals then you may require one of the newer models. Otherwise the 'improvements' in the generations following the i-Pad2 are mostly cosmetic in this users humble opinion.
I save 5 stars for perfection. This device falls only slightly short of that.
Highly reccommended."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I think that these goods, it is of very good quality. Satisfacio my needs and my iPad still had it very well	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Some things are nice about the IPad. Some are not.  It is very maddening to me that the gmail app is so unsatisfactory. My Dad who has had an IPad for a while mentioned before that the email app was about impossible for him to use. Now I know it wasn't only because of his eyesight  problem.
Edit: I've been using the Ipad for some time, now, and no longer have a problem using the email app. Guess I got used to it, and figured out how to do it better."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	My dother wants a tablet from apple and we decide to buy in this way. The  tablet arrives on time and in perfect conditions.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	It woorks good for the moment! Ipad 2 has a nice color,works fast,not heavy, very convinient to take notes at work!	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I really like this iPad. I just couldn't give it 5 stars because the display looks alot less sharp than my iPhone 4S. I know this does not have the retina display, which is why, but it just still irritates me a bit when I use it. If I knew the new iPad would have been out soon, I would have held out on buying this until the new iPad with the retina display was out. Anyway, this iPad is still useful. I use it mostly for reading/writing emails and surfing the web while sitting on the couch. Sometimes I use Facetime which works well since my Wifi connection is fast. This thing runs smoothly and is pretty fast. The games for iPad are pretty fun to play on thing as well. Also, I find the camera is not all that great indoors and most of my indoor photos look grainy. Overall a good product but not the sharpest screen.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Je n'ai rien &agrave; dire, c'est la meilleure g&eacute;n&eacute;ration.

B0013FRNKG	The iPad came as advertised but the charger that was included wouldn't charge it. I spent $20 on a new one and it works fine. The back and edges of the iPad showed some use, nothing a protective case wouldn't hide. The screen was in perfect condition, it looked brand new.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Excellent. The IPAD2 was an excellent gift (for Christmas) especially with its camera ability and other capabilities. It has major advantages over the IPAD 1.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	hell this thing was as good as a new 1 for less $$$ great value son loves it fantastic gift	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	very solid item, the screen resolution is ok but its not sharp to be expected not having a retina display	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"My daughter's school had notified us that IPADS would be REQUIRED next school year for ALL students!

I found this one and was concerned it may have some defects due to the low price. Boy was I wrong.

The unit came through almost like new. The very first thing I did was purchase a screen protector and leather case. These are vital to keep the tablet looking like new.

The IPAD arrived in a few days and worked exactly as advertised."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	My son wanted an affordable iPad and we chose this one after shopping around.  We wanted more memory and wifi, and this was the right combination.  He loves it.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I loved this tablet. Was awesome and had a great battery life. It was awesome for apps and e-mails. Also has the perfect screen size.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This was a good value for price. Minor scratches but no functional issues. I would recommend this product to other users.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I like the Apple iPad very much, except the home key doesn't work very well on this one.  Had to take it to the Apple Store, and they took care of it.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The iPad overall is very nice. It runs smoothly and having the extra storage space is great. The only negative thing I have to say is that the screen is not the best compared to the retina display on the newer iPads and iPhones, but that is perfectly fine because of the price.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Ian in love with this device, it's quick very sufficient. The shipper sent the product out very quickly. I do all my schoolwork on it& the battery life is awesome	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I have the ipad 4 now and I have had all of the other I pads except the first generation. I am a gadget girl who luvs Apple products. Honestly speaking, there is such a small difference between the 2nd and 4th generation ipads its not worth the upgrade. If you wear glasses and/or have trouble with blurriness and stuff then by all means upgrade to the 3, but the 4th generation is not even a noticeable difference.  It does have a faster processor but not Samsung fast, so if given the choice go with the 2nd generation if its a lot cheaper than 3rd generation. If the 2nd and 3rd are close in price go for the 3rd generation.

To sum it up
1st generation- good for a kid
2nd generation- good if you can get it for a lot less than the 3rd generation.
3rd generation- good for people who can use every bit of clearness in reading/suffer from blurriness, cant find a good deal on a 3rd generation.
4th generation- if you want normal speed service, its not super fast but it is average which is good.

Now if you are trying to decide between the iPad and the samsung. You cant compare Apples and oranges. apples are apples and oranges are androids. the samsung is much much much faster and allows you to use flash, but in my opinion that is all.  The iPad has several things that are custom to work with iPad and don't function the same on the samsung tablet.  If i couldn't have the iPad I would definitely have the samsung.

The ipads, all 4 are being sold here for more than it is at the apple store. Amazon used to be my go to place for all apple products but it is a bit ridiculous that a dented,scratched and cracked ipad is being marketed for more than retail or same price as it was when it came out #GMAB maybe the price will come down after Christmas."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Product is a great and works great, No problems at all. I would tell people to get one of these	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Pros: This is the best tablet out there in the market right now.

Cons: the screen is really fragile and you should buy a cover the same thing you buy this."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I have to admit I wish i would of thought of the idea of Ipads years ago and would of banked millions haha

Ipad (2) are a necessity  for everyone ranging from a business man, to a college student to a busy mom to a learning child. Ipads have everything you need all in one and what makes this thing so great is that it works for various and different types of people needs.

Ok im from the old school days, remember when you had to carry a planner, a calendar, a calculator, a to do list, a grocery list all in your purse and before you know it, your purse had so much weight to it!!
Now ipads have all of that in one and more!!

Techonologhy has allowed us this generation to be more efficient and less time consumed by having gadgets like this run our busy lives.

Now if you don't have an ipad you may say you don't need an ipad, but I have to say you're wrong! Whether you like to read, watch movies, listen to music, play games, surf the net, do homework, ipad should be apart of your life and will make things so much simpler.

FOR KIDS:
Ipad is a great learning toy, probably the best one made. It something about the huge touch screen filled with color that makes kids go crazy for it, and with all the learning apps it will trick your kid into thinking its a toy, when their learning and playing at the same time. It amazes me how now schools like elem and middle school will now be having ipads for their students. Its great because growing up i remember having tons of books in a big ole jansport the that weighed my back down.
There are tons of apps available for kids and if you want your child to learn or sit still at home or in the car get your child an ipad

FOR STUDENTS:
If you're in college or even high school having 4 to 8 classes each class requires atleast 2 books and those books add up and are even costly. Ipad 2 can save all that and even save on buying those stocks of notebook paper. ipad 2 allows you to take notes and have all your college books stored on there. Amazing!

FOR BUSY MOMS:
being a mom is a very busy 24 hour job!!! And as a mom you have to keep up with appointments, doc visits for your child, birthdays, and etc. Instead of carrying a planner, calendar, and etc. Having an ipad and apps for your busy mom. schedule makes life a bit more easier.

Ipads are great for every age and even grandmas/grandpas. The huge screen allows us readers to zoom in and see everything clearly.

MY EXPERIENCE:
At 1st when iPads came out i said i did not NEED one simply becuz Iam always glued to my computer! and than computers wasn't portable easily, i mean yes you can take it with you, but i mean can you slip it right in your purse...no! I never really left home with my laptop because i had to find wi fi and than carry it in its case, bring the plug, it just felt like too much! And than the iPhones came out! I'm like great portability, internet, email check on the go, Facebook, tweet, on the go!!!
But as great as the iphones are they are made for that....to be a phone and being on the internet and etc would drain my battery and i need it for calls. but the major drawback for me was the screen, iphone 4s screen seems sooo small compared to an ipad 2

So one day my husband convinced on an iPad 2 by getting me one, and i was instantly in love!!

as much as I work on my computer at home, once I'm done and i want to relax and read n surf the internet n listen to some music i pull out my iPad 2 and i own a mac. I don't want a laptop on my lap while I'm laying down.
And than the portability!! love it i can slip this in my purse, i don't need to bring a charger, case, and etc, just the iPad and I'm out the door.
Now ipads shouldn't be computer replacements if you do most work on a computer. Now if you do a lot of homework, word docs, emailing on a iPad i would definitely suggest a keyboard, my hands hurt just typing this review
I use my ipad for everything from listening to pandora to watching Netflix movies while I'm in the kitchen cooking. Its a great entertainment tool and saves money on electricity instead of having the tv and radio on all the time.

Battery Life:
When i first got the iPad 2 it felt like it took 2 days for it die even with heavy use, now after couple of months I have to charge it atleast once a day. on heavy use, it can last a couple of hours with no charge. So battery life is ok

Touch screen:
Very responsive touch screen better than other touch screen tablets. You don't have to press hard and it quickly responds to your fingertips!

Screen size:
I think the screen size is a bit big, but great, I mean you can see everything so clearly and zoom in and everything is right in your face.

Weight:
I carry this in my purse daily and im not complaining of shoulder pain. It does add a little weight to my purse but nothing where its like omg i have to take this out my bag. In comparison its like having 2 notebooks in your bag/purse

Cons:
Unlike most other tablets they have hdmi ports, sd slots, usb slots ipads have none of those. It would be great if it atleast can take a memory card on its own and not need to buy a accessory to attach to transfer photos.

Camera:
camera quality back and front sucks to me. The way phones are made now with 8 mp cameras the ipad 2 is in no comparison its camera quality is like a razor phone, when cameras on phones first came out. Like it does the job but nothing to print out and frame up.

Overall I think apple did a great concept for technology by creating this and making our busy lives less hectic. iPads can be used for everything from music, to youtube, to web surfing, to email, to word docs, to reading, and so much more. If you're undecided to get an ipad, consider it. I don't think you'll regret like return it back, you ll be too in love. It is a bit pricy but than again all apple products are, and honestly coming from windows for over 12years straight and android phones for over 10 years straight i only regret not going to apple sooner.

Its like having a nissan car 1st and driving a bentley after, you'll never want to go back to a nissan

I love my Ipad 2, im using it now for this review and i use it every single day! happy shopping!"	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"This thing came with a charger, but it didn't charge !!!
Everything else works doh, like new..
I would recommend buying from apple because 1 year warranty is really sweet..."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I am new to iPad, so I don't really have anything to compare it with. It was very hard to set up, but then that could be to my ignorance of how these things work. A friend helped me to set it up, and I've been learning how to use it since. I plan to use it at my religious meeting with literature that I download for that purpose. I know I will come to love it so much in time.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"This is a great purchase. a little more expensive than the competition but worth it.
We now have 2 iPads in the home. I write program code in microsoft base programs. If I ever quit programming I will say goodby to microsoft."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	What can I say. It is a overpriced Apple product and works as intended. Buy a Kindle fire HD and go out and eat with the savings.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This was a good buy... at a reasonable cost. There were a few scratches at the corners on the back but overall a good product.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Hardware:
The design of the iPad is exceptional with smooth curved edges and elegant textures of soft-touch metal. One problem that is apparent and has been stated multiple times is the weight of the device. It is too heavy to hold comfortably with one hand and the wrist may feel sore or achy after long periods of use. At the time of release, the screen was good enough for the average person to use. However, now with HD screens on devices less than half the size, the iPad's screen is seeming to pale in comparison. In addition, the battery life is quite exceptional. It lasts for weeks in Standby mode and also for long duration while reading or watching movies. Another point is that the cameras on the device are extremely poor, the resulting pictures looking too pixelated to view. You can forget about low-light shooting, because of a lack of flash and a poor image sensor.
Software:
iOS has always been a novel user interface, not for the unlimited functions, but for the extremely easy to use USER INTERFACE. Heck, I have seen kids not even 2 years old who know how to unlock and play their favorite games on the devices. The app store offers an abundance of games, and ""productivity"" apps. However, these productivity apps are not that easy to use. Lots of fonts supported by Microsoft Word do not work on these apps and the formatting is often completely messed up when transitioning from my laptop to the iPad. Apple needs to get Microsoft to build a preloaded app that will be accessible from other places in the OS.

Overall:
It's hard to recommend a product which is primarily limited to games, but if you're looking for an entertainment device, I would recommend the iPad 3 or 4 which have better graphics, a better processor, and a better screen. For the price, this is a good buy."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	This is my first tablet device, so I don't have a lot to compare it with. But except for some difficulty with some web forms not responding to touch input, it has been a great solution for someone who doesn't need a laptop, but wants to do some writing away from my desk.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I am still trying to get on to all of its wonderful qurikes

B0013FRNKG	I love my iPad, but I'm frustrated with the struggle to get it in sync with my PC!!!!!!!  Even the person I have been in touch with at Apple is frustrated. Can you believe that!!?!?!?!  I really want to enjoy working with my PC and my iPad!!!!!!!	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Love this ipad! This is my first tablet purchase for myself, and I really love it! I'm still trying to figure out all that can be done with it, but so far have not had anything bad to say about it. It so far has exceded my expectations, in all areas except for the camera part (not great pictures)..if it didn't have it I wouldn't mind.. I didn't purchase it to use the camera.. I have a dslr for that. It's easy to use , so easy that my 2 year old grand-daughter knows exactly how it works.. :)
  4 stars just because of the camera issue..."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I just really love this iPad. It is the first one I have ever had. I am learning about all the apps and find it very user friendly. A good buy for the price.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Wanted something for accessing the web and watching videos, you cant do better, there is competition out there but no android tablet has the responsiveness that the iPad does which is everything in a tablet, how can you have a touch screen device that's lagging and does not recognize your touch, colors on this are amazing, wish the front camera was a little better since I use Skype quite a bit, but its not that bad either, other than that perfect device, and I researched for a few months so I know there is nothing better out there, external storage and all those other gimmicks won't matter if you don't use your device cause its not that responsive, this one is , also you can't beat the apple App Store, no competition there either...maybe android tablets might get better in the coming years, but right now no competition , just buy this cause you won't regret this but with an android tablet right now there is a chance you might. And I am an android fan and own the galaxy s3 so not just saying this, only trying to give credit where it's due and apple has it down with this product for sure, hope this helps anyone looking for anew tablet right now	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	There is still alot I need to learn about the iPad 2, but so far it is wonderful. It has a ton of apps to use, so you never get bored. Having a good time with it.	4	electronics

B0013FRNKG	I bought this for my 2 years old son. It looks new without any scratch as it advertised. All the functions are good. It comes with a box with all the items inside. Deliver on time. Overall I m satisfied.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Glad I went with the 32 GB, I need the space for my pictures and music. It has been a learning curve to all the things the iPad does but a very easy to learn. Really enjoy my iPad.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Destroyed my laptop in a usual manner - drop from the counter.  Bought an iPad 2 and tried to use it as a laptop replacement.  I did last several months and didn't really feel that my range was somehow limited.  Eventually I purchased a laptop to use on a long trip.  It was a huge relief to go back to a bigger screen, fixed keyboard, windowed environment, and faster processing speeds.
iPad is a revolutionary device and I find its design and build quality outstanding.  However, once the novelty wears off, it becomes apparent that it is best at supplementing your other mobile devices, not completely replacing them.
The device is also fragile, so make sure to buy a sturdy case, especially if you plan to use your device in the field."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"This iPad is everything I wanted.......except for one small detail! After a week or so of enjoying my newly found freedom I was shocked to find out I was once again restricted .

Now I'm so frustrated for I cannot exchange nor upgrade this less than desirable used product!
Me and myself stuck with it!!!!!"	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	it is ok, excpet that too expensive for those software. I should learn to pay for the price of IP. HAHA!	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I appreciate the fact that mistakes are sometimes made, but to order a black IPad Tablet and have white one arrive makes one wonder how well the quality control system works.  The distributor provided a smart cover to atone for the mistake.  That was appreciated, but cannot dispel the disappointment in receiving the wrong product.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"This is an ideal item for the business Mom--
Work:
* Great for checking email- Microsoft docs you will have to download app for attachments.  Also Adobe files are no accessible either since Bill and Steve didn't get along.
* Webcasts/conference calls
* Linkedin, etc
* Love how small it is.
Mom engineering:
1. Great for Movies/games apps  for the little ones
2. Fb
3. Exercise videos when on the run
Negatives:
After downloading 2 Disney Movies and one exercise video I am being told I don't have enough storage on iCloud.  Of course, I am sure I Cloud is willing to sell me additional space.  LOL"	4	electronics

B0013FRNKG	I have had a couple of iPhones, and now this iPad.  I like it, mostly because the same apps for my phone are on it.  I did not get the cellular package, as I use it mainly at home and at hot spots, but so far, I have liked it.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I feel like all the hype around the iPad before its launch made it seem like it was going to be the greatest and most revolutionary thing since the first PC, and then it came out and there was a little disappointment because it wasn't, but now there seems to be this comfortable feeling that the iPad has nestled into our lives. It doesn't change everything, but it's great for playing games, surfing the web, and reading books while you're on the couch, or a plane, or a bus. It also has great battery life, the camera's are a great feature, and even though they aren't the quality, you won't use it as much as you might think. It's not the greatest thing ever, and you can do without it, but it is really fun to use, and I read all my books on it now. Plus, you feel this sense of harmony when you get it synced up with your computer of phone over iCloud.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I got it in 3 days, super fast. It's clean and awesome. My family thought it was brand new. So far as I learn to use it and load up the apps I'm loving it. If I wanted to nit-pick and this is nit-picky, I didn't like the bubble envelope it was packaged in, but that's about it. Everything else is cool.
Thanks Amazon and thanks Encore Equipment!"	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	My iPad 2 has worked great for me, and even though I originally expected that I would need more space, the 16 GBs have been plenty. However, this is my first tablet, and one thing I've noticed is that it's hard to do much besides watch movies, play games, and check email on them without some sort of a keyboard. The on-screen keyboard is just too clunky and hard to use to be very productive on. If this was easier to use, I'd give it 5 stars.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"There's no question the iPad is an amazing device. Life is better now that I own one. With all the hype about it though I really expected it to be slightly better than it is.  It's hard to rate this exactly 3 or 4 stars so I'd rank it closer to four. Below summarizes why.

PROs:
It's amazingly fast.
Amazing battery life and the exact battery remaining percentage icon is a great feature instead of the usual cellphone-like icon showing a quarter, half, etc. Battery life is really one of the best things about it.
It turns on instantly and is ready for anything. Shuts down and sleeps just as quick. You almost never have to shut it down to undo a lockup. Notice I said ""almost"".
Loads websites fast, and almost all apps work problem-free.
Tons of content available, much of it free or just $.99
Built well and damn-near bulletproof case. It looks sleek and you don't want to put it down once you start using it.
It's lightweight and I don't notice it getting hot. So much more pleasant to use on the couch than a laptop. If you haven't spent an evening browsing the net from your couch with the iPad, you don't know what you're missing.

CONs:
Sadly the cons are quite significant in my mind. Doesn't mean I'm taking it back but kind of amazing that Apple didn't address this with the ipad2. First, the lack of flash support on the iPad is HIGHLY ANNOYING.  I cannot overstate this. I have read many reviews and talked to enough fan-boys that tell me flash is outdated and isn't going to be used much longer, HTML 5 will replace it, on and on. To that I say YEAH RIGHT.  Flash is everywhere. Many major corporations and product companies use flash on their sites. If you cant run it, you WILL miss out on content. I had no idea how big this was until i got an ipad.
If you use amazon you need flash. Otherwise forget watching any product videos. To have to move to a desktop because my tablet won't do flash is unacceptable. I have heard that apple chose not to allow it due to battery life issues, but this doesn't seem like a valid enough point. It's probably more than this: political between adobe and apple. Here's a newsFLASH: how about just giving us the option to turn flash browsing off if battery life is the real reason? Maybe I'd rather have four hrs of battery life and be able to watch video than have 10 hrs of battery. This is the most glaring problem with the iPad and if you are in the market for a tablet, do your comparison shopping and check the android tablets before you decide. Wish I had. This is a problem I encounter almost every day.

Lack of a back button-there is not always a way to 'back out' of an application on the ipad as there is with other tablets, again namely the android tablets. Sometimes you get knee deep in an application and hit a wall, the only way out is to hit the home bezel button which means you have to close and  start the app over. With other tablets you just go back one step.  Not a huge annoyance, but annoying nonetheless and probably happens every other day or so.

Text ain't that sharp-I thought for sure owning an iPad I'd have razor sharp text just like the razor sharp graphics on the rest of the unit. Not so. Text is just 'ok'.  I just find myself having to blow things up sometime to view them clearly, and I have good vision. This may be a little knit picky... Text is fairly sharp as you enlarge and stretch content. I have read some other reviews touting sharper text on competing tablets though.

Safari ain't that great either-safari is extremely limited and again apple won't let you have Firefox for the iPad. Basically I think safari provides a far less pleasing browsing experience. My main gripe is that safari will not 'wordwrap'. This means when you zoom in on a web pages the article will stroll horizontally which means extra work to have to read it. (Your home computer will wrap the text automatically, meaning the article or web page way get longer in length, but stays  only one screen length in width.... This makes for an easier reading experience).
If you do lots of reading online this can get tiring constantly having to scroll horizontally as well as vertically without word wrap. This isn't a problem on the kindle fire and android phones, I presume it isn't a problem on their tablets, either.

The war against Google-it's no secret apple and Google will one day be even more of direct competitors than they are now, and I find that gmail sometimes just will not open on the iPad. It hangs up and locks up the unit, and I mean LOCKS UP the unit rendering the rest of safari useless until I can get it to calm down and close out.  I have no idea why but gmail is the only website that gives me a problem in safari. It's annoying and I feel unnecessary.  it's not my Internet and not my WiFi either because it works on every other computer and device in the house.  There is a gmail app, but I share the tablet with other people and kids and I want my email access separately in a browser. Sadly gmail and the iPad don't mix and that sucks.

SUMMARY:
Despite the gripes above the iPad is still a marvelous machine, albeit not perfect. It's loads better than using a laptop for daily surf and email. You probably won't regret buying one, and if you do the high resale value means you'll have not problem unloading it. If you are a Google or android user, you do owe it to yourself to check out the android tablets side by side before making a purchase. I can tell you for sure that for browsing the net and reading articles, Google's android built in browser is loads better than safari.  I think the iPad had been incorrectly assumed as being vastly superior because it's apple, but it has some major flaws.
However even with those it is still as a whole a superb machine. It's an amazing piece of technology and far superior for web browsing than a computer or laptop. Just a personal tip--if you're on the fence about what color to get, go with white. Black is cool too, but white will stay looking cleaner (black shows every fingerprint) and will not show little nicks and scratches on the case like black will.

B0013FRNKG	"I did quite a bit of research before finally deciding on buying the iPad 2. The iPad was easily my last choice of all  tablets when i started my search, because i have had a bad history with apple and i swore off all of there products. I noticed a trend when i start going deep into the reviews and previews of competitor tablets, and that trend was that everything hoped to rival the iPad. There are decent alternatives, but unfortunately the iPad is still the tablet to beat.

I choose the iPad 2 of the iPad 3, because for the upgrades from the predecessor were not of any interest. I take photos on a dslr, and if i want to watch HD videos then i can watch them on my laptop.

So far i am guilt fully enjoying the iPad 2. It has proved to me more useful than I envisioned: It's productivity apps work across multiple platforms, it's home to one of my favorite card games (magic 2013!), and it's internationally user friendly (chinese gf).

My biggest complaint is more on the OS and hardware side of things. I wish that the iOS allowed for exporting files to an external hdd. That would have made this product prefect for me."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"This is a case of moving up from an IPhone to an IPad!  Only issue was it was received with
a dent on the corner, even though it was in its packaging which did not appear dented.  It
functions as advertised and the screen size is so much more readable than the phone."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Pad arrived in good shape. Takes lots of time to download manual. Good product but you really cannot compute with it or do spread sheets. Not sure why I bought it. Just another high expensive toy. But nicely done by Apple.	4	electronics

Nevertheless, the release of the New iPad brings forth a new question: Should you buy the now cheaper iPad 2?

There are many factors to be considered when making this purchase. The main upgrades of the New iPad include retina display, faster processor, better cameras, and with iOS 6, siri. My family owns both the iPad 2 and the New iPad. Apple did not change the iPad much between these two generations. It kept the same battery life, the same thickness (almost), and the same design. Thus, it is a personal decision.
The devices are very similar, and most of the cons of the iPad 2 are fixed in the New iPad. However, is the upgrade worth $100-150?

Cons of iPad 2 and how the New iPad uses them:

Lack of Retina Display: When the iPad 2 was released, retina display had already been seen in other apple devices, like the iPod touch 4th generation. The general public was disappointed by the lack of this feature in the iPad 2. The iPad 3 had this feature. However, I don't really notice the difference. They both appear to have excellent displays. The New iPad's improved display can only be identified in rare conditions, such as viewing upgraded apps or sharp photos. Overall, the retina display in the iPad increases the memory many apps in the app store take up. For example, many iPad 2 users posted bad reviews about Monopoly HD when they had an update that increased the memory that app took up extensively. The update of Monopoly HD did not bring any new features besides Retina display. iPad 2 users were angry because now they lost memory without any benefits.

Lack of better Cameras: The iPad 2's cameras are terrible. They back facing camera is .7 megapixels. On a smaller screen this would be acceptable because it is still HD, but on a 10 in. screen photos shot by the iPad camera look pixelated. The New iPad is said to have 5 megapixel cameras. Even so, the cameras on the New iPad aren't that great. Look at the video I posted so you can see the difference yourself. The video is best viewed in full screen.

Faster Processor: The iPad 2 has a decent processor and is capable of doing everything you can currently do on an iPad decently. The iPad 3 is faster, especially when loading apps. The upgrade is great but not necessary.

Siri: With iOS 6, the New iPad will have exclusive new abilities like Siri. Although many are not appreciative of siri after seeing it on the iPhone, the fact that the New iPad will now have it suggests that apple will continue to do this. Apple's newest products will continue to receive features that older products won't have through updates. Thus, it may be a good idea to purchase the New iPad as another one is not expected soon."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	No hassel in purchasing or receiving this item. Works great and made it in time for Father's Day . . . yeah!	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"It is a very good tablet.

I like it and I am happy with it. It fits all m requirements and is exactly what i was expecting.

thank you"	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	You can't buy a 64 gig IPad2 in stores anymore. Amazon had it for a good $100 less. The 2 doesn't have as good camera resolution as three, but that's what I use my IPhone for. And with Cloud all of the pics come to my IPad, then I do all of my photo editing. It has virtually replaced my laptop!	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I love my new ipad.  Had a little trouble setting it up and ended up going to a local apple store, but they couldn't help too.  I finally got it working after a few days,  I won't leave home with out it.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I love the iPad, its great for taking on holiday, so much less bulky than a laptop, didn't receive a sim card with it though	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	So far, so good. I bought it 'like new' for $30 cheaper than a new I-Pad. Came quickly and so far product working fine.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	My screen cracked within 6 days of having this it fell exactly one inch and bam iPad cracked but I digress this is a awesome device and pages looks better here than on my computer it is great for productivity and just plain fun and games I love it just I wish it wasn't so fragile	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Oh how I have coveted the IPads belonging to family and friends; I simply couldn't justify the cost vs. how I was going to use it. Having had one now for five days, I can't imagine life without one.  I haven't even booted up my laptop since getting it. Granted, I took advantage of the price drop since the release of the 3 but after consulting with several experts informing me that the 2 would be a wise purchase at the lessor price I took the plunge. I'm delighted I did.

I will not get into technical jargon, but what pleasure this product makes computing. At this point, I know that I have barely scratched the surface. It's extremely intuitive and quick. I thought I might have difficulty with the keyboard, but the keys are large enough and respond nicely when touched. Video streams efficiently and I like how quickly the screen self-adjusts from vertical to horizontal and back again. The images are crystal clear and the camera takes great pictures.

I do have an issue and it is a common one with many people that have the IPad, it does not support Flash. Many of the things I do on the net and job-wise use Flash, so I will have to use other devices if an activity uses it. I also own a Kindle Fire and I like it too. Comparatively, the IPad does so much more, but it does come at a higher price. If you just want to be able to do basic web browsing, reading, and watch movies, the Fire is great.  If you want to go above and beyond that, IPad is the way to go."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I wish I knew that the iPad2 had the old operating system on it before I bought it. I would probably have bought it any way but I would have been prepared.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I love my IPad! I still have much to learn about its full features but it's great for web browsing, checking e-mail and social networking. I purchased the wifi one because I don't need another monthly expenditure. However, it's great for books too. I can't wait to save money by purchasing e-textbooks instead of getting ripped off by the bookstore at my school.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The iPad was delivered as promised by the Amazon vendor.  My son loves the iPad.  It is exactly what we expected.  It's too bad Apple's support website is so weak.  For a toy that is supposed to be able to be used by a 12 year old intuitively, there's a lot on the iPad that is not intuitive...	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	well i really do like this product!! i do think that the app store needs more interesting and fun games but the ones they do have are okay.....i use it all the time for everything! i even typed a script for english class on it although i couldn't find out how to print it! anyway ovrall i think if you have the first generation you don't need to upgrade because my freind has it and she says its just fine!!!!	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I got my iPad 2 a few months ago and have been using it more than I thought I would.  I haven't used any other tablets, really, so I'm not sure how it compares against others.

Good:

- Graphics
- Battery life (about 10 hours)
- Relatively light
- Stylish

Bad:

- The camera
- Wi-fi only or you need a model that uses a wireless plan
- Touch-screen keyboard is accurate but physical ones are preferable to me.
- Fragile? Mine's fine but I haven't dropped it yet.  Many cracked ones on eBay though

I bought a 3rd party smart case and a dock with a physical keyboard and both are useful.  I have a laptop and I don't think an iPad is a good replacement for a tablet or a computer but it's good for a quick browse on the internet or to play games or music."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I bought this when it first came out, so I bought it from Apple. It is amazing! It has plenty more features than the iPad 1. The iPad has a long battery life, great processor, and is very, very durable. However, the camera on this iPad is slightly mediocre at best. Don't waste too much money on the iPad 3, go with this one.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I purchased a refurbished Ipad2 and loved it until I realized I made a mistake by not getting the one with the +3g.  I now find out that I cannot get a internet connection through a provider so I cannot take it on the road or anywhere they do not have WIFI.  I still love the IPAD2....I just wish I would have investigated more into the product.  Hope this helps someone else from making the same mistake.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	TY GET THE iPAD!!!! You want this more than you want the kindle! You know you do! Get the iPad!!!! ;)	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"So I got my iPad 2 the first Friday of summer 2011, and have been loving it ever since. I use it for school (I'm practically paperless) and for entertainment. I got the 32 gigabyte model because I store a lot of apps, music, and pictures (from memebase, damn memebase.) With out further ado, here is my full review.

Hardware: the hardware for the iPad is great. The aluminum body is sleek, strong, and stylish. I feel very confident in the Apple build quality to withstand most of the things I do. The plastic on the iPad is very little, and still strong. It has your usual 30 pin port on the bottom, which is huge and I don't see why they don't make a smaller one. If you liked charging your iDevice with your computer, tough luck. Only a new MacBook Pro or a new iMac can charge the iPad 2.  I have neither. All in all, I give the hardware an A+.

Cases: A case is needed, however. My case is leather, and I got it for the magnetic closure, but for my use, it just isn't sturdy enough. Right now. I'm using&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/rooCASE-Dual-Station-Premium-Leather-Magenta-Case-Cover-with-Stand-for-Apple-iPad-2-iPad-3-The-new-iPad/dp/B004S4APTU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">rooCASE Dual Station Premium Leather (Magenta) Case Cover with Stand for Apple iPad 2 / iPad 3 / The new iPad</a>&nbsp;in red; I couldn't find the red one in the product link section. With out a case or with a poor case, the corners will get pretty scuffed up and ugly. Also, on mine, the black plastic color part is kind of peeling. It's not that bad, though. Mind you that i'm a student, so I might do more things than you do. I recommend you get the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Speck-Products-CandyShell-Wrap-for-iPad-2-DarkLord-Black-SPK-A0418/dp/B004SGSH4S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Speck Products CandyShell Wrap for iPad 2 - DarkLord Black (SPK-A0418)</a>. I just ordered it from Amazon $20 cheaper than from the Speck site.

iOS 5: I am at iOS 5.0.1, and for some reason, my iPad won't let me upgrade to 5.1. There isn't a huge difference, so don't feel like you are missing out.  The iOS is great. Everything is smooth, and the Internet browsing is great with the tabs. You can even split the keyboard in two and type with your thumbs, which is,neat, but not useful until you really learn how to use it. iCloud is also great. Every app I download on my iPhone gets downloaded on my iPad, and vice versa. Really useful. Still no freaking flash, though. There is an app you can download called Photon flash web browser, which lets you run flash programs. Really great for watching FLASH videos, if you know what I mean. I HAD TO! I HAD TO! I'm sorry. That was the dumbest thing ever, but you get what I mean. I rate the OS an A-

Battery: I love the battery life, and at school, if I don't use it a lot, I can use it for another day. It has by far the best battery life of any LCD screen device I have. 'nuff said, A+

Speed: the iPad is super quick with its A5 processor, running apps like a charm and browsing the Internet sometimes faster than my laptop. Hell. It is  probably is faster than my laptop. If you want something fast, it's definitely something to consider. A+

Weight: not too heavy, but not too light either. Feels perfect. It fits in my booksack, so it's good for me. A

One thing that makes me rate it 4 stars is the AirPrint or whatever Apple calls it. (my iPad recognized the word and spellchecked it, so I think I that's right) It's complete crap. There are only a select few printers that it can print to, and you have to jailbreak if you want otherwise. It's so dumb, and I print things a lot. I truly hate it. I am soon going to buy the network printing app on Cydia, so that will soon be gone, but still. Bad choice, Apple.

All in all, I rate the iPad 2 an A. If you want to save some money, buy the iPad 2 instead of the new iPad, but if it's your starting model and you don't care about the price, go with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Apple-iPad-MD328LL-A-16GB-Wi-Fi-White-NEWEST-MODEL/dp/B00746MXF8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Apple iPad MD328LL/A (16GB, Wi-Fi, White) NEWEST MODEL</a>. The only reason to but this one is if you are price-conscious and the new iPad is too much for you. The iPad 2 is still great,but the display on the new one and the better proccessor make it a better buy."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Last year I made the leap from a laptop to the iPad 2 64gig on the AT&T network. I still carried the laptop incase there was something the iPad couldn't do. After 9 months i only had to takeout my laptop 6 times and that was for download files onto a memory stick to load onto a server I was working on. that is the only drawbac on this wonderful device. If apple ever makes it where you can plug in a usb stick and download files directly to it. The laptop as we know it will be a dinasuar.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Absolutely great device.

Pros
--------------
Beautiful display
Front and back camera
Nice UI
Strong processor
Durable
Great app store

Cons
------------
Expensive compared to other tablets"	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The IPAD 2 I bought is a very good product. However, with the proliferation of tablets made by all the major tech giants, more functionalities have to be added to this device. Currently, it is overpriced and their are no ways to transfer imges/videos from the ipad to my computer or my phone through bluetooth or USB. there are only interfaces with other apple products which is not good enough.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I love my iPad, there's not enough time in the day for me to be on it! I'm. Amazed at what this can expose me to, I can read about what's  going on anywhere in this world, I have so many games, magazines,books, bibles, news papers and broadcast news, read and send Emails. I wonder what more the next iPad will have to offer. I ordered this iPad used but to me it's brand new. I'm 69 yrs old and still learning, I love modern tech. Thank you Amazon .com	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	When the IPAD first came out I wrote it off as just a big IPOD Touch.  But over a year later I was given a great deal on one and went for it and I'm glad I did.  Since October I can't recall a day where I haven't picked mine up.  My only regret is I wish I would've gotten the 32gb model instead of the 16gb because your space will be eaten up fast.  All I'm saying is if you're on the fence about one go ahead and take a dive.  I use mine for browsing, reading comics, watching Hulu, occasional games, listening to music and reading books.  Sometimes I have to put it down just to take in the world around me.  Originally I had a Samsung Galaxy Tablet and while I enjoyed it, I made the switch to the Ipad for the overwhelming amount of applications.  Tablets are the future IMO and with the Ipad you really can't go wrong.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	iPad arrived in good time but I am having problems with the camera. The pictures are not always clear. The resolution is not good. I took it to Apple and they said the camera is just not that good with the iPad 2's.  This is disappointing. My daughters ipad2 takes good pictures but mine does not. Guess its a hit or miss.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The iPad was received in good condition, but in Japanese, which I am not fluent.  After reconfiguring the device and talking with Apple I was able to get it to work well.  The seller performed just as advertised and it was received before the delivery date.  As far as I can tell it will perform well and nothing can go wrong, go wrong, go wrong, go wrong.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Apple released one of the most amazing products on March 2 of 2011 called the iPad 2, and it is one of the most innovating and exciting tablets to hit the market. This aluminum body tablet is 9.7 inches weighing 1.3 pounds making it one of the lightest tablets on the market today, also having an A5 dual chip processor and a 720p retina screen display. It comes in three sizes, 16,32 and 64 depending on your downloading and previous photos, videos and music you can choose which one will better suit you. This tablet is a must buy if you're a traveler or you want a cool gadget to play games, listen to music, take photos and view all your social networks. Not to mention its great battery life when your on the go except for when your watching movies. The layout on the device is very structured so if you're a user that has an android phone then you probably won't like the feel that the iPad gives out. If you're an apple fanatic like myself who has all apple products then this will be another great add on to the collection.

  Working at BestBuy you have the exciting job to know all the truth behind products as well as being able to get them a little early, nevertheless I must say that this was worth the buy. For the average man it will cost you 500 dollars, 543.11 to be exact when you pay NYS tax but like I said it's worth the buy. Launching the iPad was a great idea, with this device you can take notes and organize your daily tasks and if you just want a device to use to play thousands of games (many which are free) then this is a great buy. Personally carrying a MacBook pro to school each and everyday puts a toll on your back, so the iPad is a easier way to have a device which can do most of the things your computer can do, it is called an accessory to a MacBook

  Personally this has to be one of greatest products out there I remember when I first bought it and synced it using iCloud to my other apple devices. Apple has always had a classy start up screen, so all you see in BOLD letters is ""Welcome"" following ""IPAD 2"" in an artistic but simple manner. I take it with me to school every time so I can take my notes and search the web, not to mention going on twitter or Facebook while class isn't in session. Its your everyday ""Big cellphone"" you cant help but take pictures on it, or add music it to and buy dozens of cases as if it were on of your new cellphones.

 The only thing that might bother a user is that it doesn't support Adobe Flash player. Many people can't stand that because they love to watch movies and video clips and the iPad doesn't support it, that is the biggest upset with the iPad. With the iPad you have the option of accessing the Internet via Wi-Fi or threw a hotspot, which is convenient for the user making it easy to tap into the World Wide Web.

 Overall if this device is in your budget you should get one, preferably a black one, the white one gets pretty dirty (I have one). If you are buying the iPad make sure you also include a protection plan because if you accidently drop it (since your going to be having a world of fun) the screen will crack, it is made up of glass.  Enjoy!"	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Product Review: Apple iPad 2
 I would like to begin by saying I do not work for Apple nor do I know anyone who does. This review is my total honest opinion on the Apple iPad 2. I have no connection to Apple and this is my honest experience with the item. Advertisements and commercials for products are always circulating twenty four-seven. This also applied to the iPad 2. I had not paid much attention to the advertisements as I was satisfied with my iPad though at the moment, and had no need for the device.
One day while at home, my iPad fell out of my hands and was destroyed. I thought maybe to buy a new iPad but then the idea off an iPad 2 came to mind. The iPad 2 was released on March of 2011. I had seen so many commercials and heard so much about it. So the next day I got my little piggy bank, emptied it out and had about $28. Yeah, there was not too much money in my little piggy.
I got the rest of the money from my parents, and the next day went to the closest Best Buy and bought a 16GB iPad 2 black tablet for the price of $499.99.  I also bought the 1 year accidental protection plan for $99.99, knowing my clumsy hands and bad luck. So I had spent around $600.00 on a single item. So this Apple iPad 2 I had gotten was supposed to be near perfect on the amount of money I had spent on it and way better then my iPad. Now the Apple iPad 2 was 7.3 x 9.5 x 0.3 inches in dimensions. The iPad 2 was really thin and really comfortable to hold.
It was also lighter then the iPad, not by too much but still a bit lighter. Now that I told you a little bit about the physical characteristics, let me tell you the new features that make this item unique. Apple doubled the RAM in iPad 2 from around 256MB to 512 MB. This will help process graphics for games and help deliver images faster. The two cameras is also a better feature over the old iPad, one in the front facing you and one in the back. Now these cameras aren't anything special. Their digital effect is just alright and the pictures will not come out too crisp or clear. The cameras do help with video chatting and FaceTime.
One of the biggest disappointments I had with my iPad was that it was never available to multi task. The iPad 2 increased RAM allows more applications to be open at once. Now these applications are available in the app store. There are close to 70,000 iPad specific Apps that work on the iPad 2. There are also Google Books, iBook, Nook, Kindle for readers on the iPad 2. I can use all these apps all day long because of the battery life.
The iPad 2 battery last over 10 hours constantly on. The need to recharge battery constantly is not necessary. Now as great as the iPad 2 is with all these qualities, every coin has two sides, this applies to iPad 2. There are several things still needing improvement on the iPad 2. There is no USB support for mass storage. There is also still no dedicated SD card slot. For example, if I wanted to put pictures onto the iPad from my camera, I would need an adapter.
Another distinguishing flaw in the iPad 2 is the lack of flash support. There are many programs that require the iPad 2 to run on Adobe Flash. The Android tablet on the other hand does allow Flash support. The iPad 2 is a great and impressive tablet that can be purchased in the market today. The iPad 2 is probably the best on the market at the moment. The iPad 2 isn't perfect and the price may be a bit high but if you can afford it, I would recommend it for you."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I would give this a 5 star rating if it was able to run Flash.  Too many websites that require Flash to fully appreciate them, but besides that I can't tell you the last time I touched my home laptop!  It's light, thin, and the battery lasts for a long time!	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Initially bought the Impression Tablet from HSN and all I can say is that that product is garbage. After coordinating to send it back and get refunded, I ordered my wife the IPAD2. This was right after Christmas by the way, and we have yet to have a single issue with the IPAD2. I have a rather cheap in cost wireless router, and the IPAD can reach it from anywhwhere (2k sf) in my house. Has never froze and had to reboot! Highly recommend this product to anyone. Wife mainly uses it for apps for the kids! They love it also and I find the apps very educational. Only downside.... the price. Hence the 4 stars.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I wanted a lightweight tablet to replace my laptop for school use, and after weighing my options, I decided on the iPad 2 over the Samsung Galaxy tab because Apples appstore is alot more disverse and expansive. With apps like Documents To Go Premium and AVPlayerHD, it has almost completely replaced my laptop, and with the keyboard/case combo I ordered it does word processing just fine. It does pretty well with the battery life at mid-level brightness and does terrific on the lowest setting. Im a college student and Im at school for 12 hours on some days, so time is factor and it delievers.

My one big issue with the iPad is its restrictions. You can not drag and drop items like word documents, images, pdf's, videos to and from the ipad without itunes, and because the iPad natively only plays a few video formats, you have to download an app if you want a broader selection. AVPlayerHD plays all video formats and actually allows you to drag these files into the sharing option in itunes. Which makes the device feel much more diverse, but the app isn't free, its about 1.99 in the appstore. Aside from the restriction issue I really like it, it hasn't completely replaced laptop, not until your able to transfer items without the use of iTunes.

(There are apps like AVPlayerHD that allow you to transfer  certain incompatible files to your ipad through iTunes, and Im sure there are some for photos and documents, but you'll have to hunt for them down and they probably won't be free -but I guess if you can afford to shell out the dough for an iPad you can afford a couple 1 to 10 dollar apps-)

I reccomend the iPad, its pretty cool.

*Update*

I got my iPad on Jan 14th, 2012 and got rid of it February 12th, 2012. It was very fun for awhile, but once the novelty wore off the iPad was just too limited. I needed more freedom and less hassle, I'm not a fan of going through iTunes for virtually all data transferring. I cant hook anything up to it without some ridiculous peripheral; something as simple as an SD or MicroSD card slot could have made a world of difference, my model was 16 gig. After the iOS 5 update it was down to about 13, and I had over 6 gigs for music and 8 for previous iPod touch apps.

I had tons of movies but with the limited none expandable space, I could only fit about three compressed movies at a time, which were greatly smaller in size compared to anything offered in the iTunes store. I greatly regret not going with the Galaxy Tab, which in terms of flexibility is incredibly superior, however, neither of these are computers so the overall flexibility I prefer might never be on that level. That said, I probably should have gone with the Galaxy, although, the iPad was very fun, it wasn't for me."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Like most, I've been smitten by the iPad since it was released about two years ago. I couldn't justify purchasing it for the longest time because I couldn't figure out how to work it into my technology regime. It's not computer enough to replace my Macbook Pro, and it's not phone enough to replace my iPhone 4 (not the 4S) running 5.0.1. When you factor in the price, I just couldn't convince myself that the iPad was something I couldn't live without.

Then the iPad 2 comes out: front- and rear-facing cameras were new, so I could use the iPad for face-timing my mom 14 hours away, but it was essentially still something halfway between a computer and an iPhone.

Finally I came to a point where I could spare the $600+ dollars to purchase the cheapest iPad 2 capable of connecting to at&t's 3G wireless service. I ordered this iPad on January 18 and just received it yesterday, so keep in mind I've only had this thing for one day.

Immediately, I can see how the iPad 2 may come off as seductive; essentially, it's a ginormous screen surrounded by a thin frame of black or white (depends on which color your purchase--I bought white) with a single button. There's no denying that it's sexy. When you turn it on (after plugging it into iTunes and completing the necessary setup) you're blown away by the crisp screen--though it's not yet on par with the Retina display of the iPhone 4 and 4S, it's a luscious screen and only the seasoned 'techie' would notice this slight inferiority. The iPad 2's screen is still better than most if not all its competition.

Apple also has a leg-up on its competition with the easy integration with iTunes. If your like me and you bought the iPad 2 to simply be what it is: an iPad, somewhere in between a computer and an iPhone--then you likely won't be filling your iPad 2's limited storage with your entire music library. I opted to sync with only my recently played music, top played music, recently added music, and a few recent playlist I've made, which I'll probably replace with newer playlists as they're made. I did sync with a fair amount of the same apps that I have on my iPhone, a handful of movies, none of my ringtones (what would I use them for?) and ended up using about 9GB of the 16GB available on the iPad 2 model I purchased. And in all actuality, after the firmware files and other junk Apple puts on their products, only about 13-14GB of the 16 are available to use out of the box.

As expected, web browsing and email are where the iPad 2 shines. It's very smooth, the screen shows side-screens and sub-menus simultaneously, which really makes this thing quick to use. I used a Best Buy gift card I received for Christmas to purchase Apple's aluminum wireless keyboard to connect to my iPad 2 via Bluetooth and, although the keyboard makes me occasionally reach over for a mouse (you must still use the touch-screen mechanism despite having an actual keyboard), typing is a DREAM on here now! Facebook is also very fun to use with the keyboard setup versus the onscreen keyboard or even using the Facebook app on my iPhone. Don't get me wrong, the onscreen keyboard of the iPad 2 is very usable, but I find with a screen as large as the iPad 2's, I'd prefer having an actual keyboard so as to utilize as much of the screen as possible for web browsing, emailing, Facebooking, and anything else.

I wish Apple would make it more clear that for at&t 3G models, the SIM card is not included and will need to be purchased separately. I haven't gotten around to going to my local at&t store to pick one up, so I'm not too sure how much a SIM card will cost.

All things considered, so far I'd say I'm happy that I purchased the iPad 2. It's only receiving 4 of the 5 stars because, although I'm very comfortable with using it and definitely see myself using it on a daily basis, it hasn't replaced any of my other electronics. In all actuality, it's become another separate electronic device that I've incorporated into my routine for its own purposes. The 4 of 5 stars also reflects the price; I understand that you 'get what you pay for' (which is definitely the case for the iPad 2, as it outperforms the competition on every aspect except price), but for a product to ADD to your routine rather than to REPLACE or SIMPLIFY, I think the price could come down just slightly. Even a difference of $50 might be enough to lure in some hesitant customers."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"After a few weeks of playing with and trying to make my iPad2 functional and integrate it into my life etc. it suddenly dawned on me that so much of what I was struggling to do ... was to make my iPad into a... notebook computer... that does the things that the Mac OS already does so well!

One of the first things I did was ... BUY A Keyboard! Mac Bluetooth.

Then it was the infatuation with ""apps!"" "" GOLLY look at this! It allows me to print a document!!""  And other absurdities like that.

You know? The stuff that we all have been doing well now for 10 plus years, with the buggy nightmares of the 90s, that used to make one pull hair out in Windows' frustration, now thankfully long suppressed... .

I used to refer to Mac devotees as ""Mac Bigots!""

But after dealing with Windows security issues, and instability through every Windows generation... I finally took the plunge with a Powerbook and never looked back. If I became less than a ""Mac Bigot,"" still I learned to love Apple's integration,  stability, sleek looks and creative tides... that happily washed over Apple's countrymen and America as a whole, like that great wave from the first iPhone.

But, this is an iPad review and although I don't desire to denigrate this generally great piece of technology or even review it seriously, I  do want to you to seriously consider a Macbook Air before the iPad.

Weight is a great part of the allure of the lightweight iPad...but... the new Macbook Air is only about twice as heavy and since it may be likely that the first thing you may buy is a Bluetooth keyboard... that may not be a deciding issue...because if you wish for your, oh so cool... purchase to actually be a functional input device of text... and you took touch-typing in high school... the plunking at an iPhone or iPad's screen... with one's THUMBS... or the dull end of your fingers... becomes a tedious devolution of functionality.

And this is the real core of my criticism of PADS in general. They are at this point clever receivers of information but clunky input...ers. One looks for app after app to do the simplest things...  and then we say... ""golly isn't that cool,  I can actually highlight text!""

And guess what? That highlighting of text usually takes a few tries to get the text that you actually need to select with ""TAPS"" selected...to 'mark-up' a doc properly... and some compromise is usually entailed and could have been far more exactly... achieved with a mouse 30 seconds ago.

Look ... do I like my iPad?
Yes!

And I did  order a stylus for 27 bucks and it has not come yet so I can't comment upon that helpful addition as a partial solution for... the iPad's entry flaws... .  But realize... when one peals away the COOL... and gets to the functional daily needs of email ... and entry of certain data... you will spend a good deal of your iPad time... which after all... is life time... learning to get around.. the touch screen and the operating system""s... limitations.

Now ... it is true that if one has say...an iMac which I Highly recommend ... that the real question is: how much...do you actually  need to input at the coffee shop or as a quick reference in the car or as a very light travel basic communication computing device? If the answer is ""not really that much..."" or if putting up with the iPad's limitations for real text entry is OK on occasion... and the added weight of a keyboard is only needed part time... then it has indeed a LOT of very cool qualities and... apps too... that we actually do find we desired and... didn't even know it!!
Are even... useful and yes... fun,  a LOT of fun.

If you work seriously on the road... an iPad is not for you... at this time in its development... if you need a very cool slick device that is indeed just about the perfect weight and size for extreme portability happiness... and mainly want it for consumption, of information... then the iPad is wonderful.

The iPad is a very creative and evolving technology. The ""Cloud"" Apple's and say Dropbox... are bringing all of these devices together and we all are literally with our use... defining their place and potential and the APP ecosystem is indeed VITAL... .

That participation in change... is in itself fun to watch and to take part in... lets face it... our participation in that creative process by supporting what works is... a central part of an iPad's attractions... nothing wrong with that! That is the old America, remember her?

Creativity  is sadly... so purposefully dimmed for political outcomes... in our dear country...that any tree of creative life left...is worth supporting even one without a real keyboard... ."	4	electronics

B0013FRNKG	not all that user friendly; had to go to apple store more than once for help; told not to use voice over feature--creates problems;  not able to have books read to me while jogging or driving--except audiobooks--somewhat disappointing. Probably better for people more IT savvy	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"After playing around an iPad2 in the Apple store, I did a little research, made the leap and bought one.

Before I placed my order, I had a few questions about which one I should get: Black or white? Would 16gb be enough, or should I go for 64gb (since it's not like you can add memory to it later)? Or maybe I should take the moderate middle road and get 32gb? I had definitely decided on WiFi, not because 3G doesn't appeal, but because I don't need another monthly bill. What about the Apple-refurbished iPads? Are they as good as the new? Is there any tangible difference? If these are the same questions you have, I'll try to flesh out these answers in detail -- as well as what the iPad is good for -- and what it is decidedly not good for, and what a dedicated PC-user (like myself) should expect from a first-time Apple purchase.

THE SPECS:

So, Question #1: White or black? I was instantly enamored by the white. It was so... different. And that is the reason to go for white. Perhaps the only one. However, the reasons not to go for white outweigh this almost immediately: Primarily, the contrast of the white does in fact make the screen appear less bright and vibrant (I noted this in the Apple store) and there are reports of light-leakage. I went for black, and have no regrets.

Question #2: What size? This was probably the question I spent the most time on, and I felt as if I couldn't get a really good answer for it. Some people seemed to find 16gb to be more than enough, while others said even 64gb wasn't enough. I almost bought the 16gb, but ended up compromising and getting a 32gb refurbished from Apple for the same price as the new 16gb. And I'm really glad I did, because I've already used more than the 14.4gb -- which is the usable space available one the 16gb.

The 16gb, I've discovered, would have been ideal for someone only using apps and browsing the internet. Forget using it for music or movie storage, it's just not happening. On my iPad I have about 80 apps currently, consuming 5.6gb of space. Contrast that with the 1300 songs I have on there which are taking up about 8gb of space, and you'll see what I mean about 16gb being an apps-only device. So, if you already have an iPod, say, then it might make sense to get the 16gb.

The 32gb is ideal for apps and storing a moderate music library, something I never would have anticipated using the iPad for -- but it turns out, I always have my iPad in my car, and find it much more convenient overall than my CDs. I've even gotten rid of an old stereo I used to play CDs on in the house. They're just kind of obsolete once you switch to storing tunes on an i-device.

The 64gb, I imagine would be perfect for storing a little of everything: Music, movies and apps. I'm actually glad I didn't go for the 64gb, as I'm perfectly happy with YouTube or streaming Netflix for a nominal monthly fee (more on this in a moment).

Question #3: Is a refurbished iPad as good as a new one? Although I don't have a new one to compare, I'm going to say yes -- with one minor caveat. The refurbished iPads have new glass, a new back cover, a new battery, the same 1 year warranty, and go through the same rounds of testing that a new iPad goes through (if you buy from Apple directly, of course). And when you think about it, why wouldn't this be just as good as getting a new iPad? After all, even a new one could have flaws that might become apparent in the first year of ownership. There aren't guarantees with any device, and when you can knock 20% off the price and make a vote for recycling electronics -- better for the Earth -- why not do it, right? Oh, and the caveat? There are a couple of times I have come across some settings that were clearly from the previous user which is... a little odd. Nonetheless the pros outweigh this, so far as I'm concerned.

All, told, if I had it to buy over again, I'd make precisely the same choices as this time: Black, 32gb, wifi, refurbished. So, onto the device itself....

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________THE IPAD:

This is my first i-device, and I have always been a PC (Windows) user in the past, so it's an entirely new experience to me. I bought it primarily because when laptop shopping I ended up getting a fantastic deal on this behemoth of a wide screen laptop. Not portable at all... so what about when I'm at the coffee shop or the bookstore and I want to tinker around, check my mail, Facebook, etc. Here's where the idea of getting an iPad came in for me. I wanted an easy-to-carry, reasonably-sized, aesthetically pleasing (and here's where the competing devices were blown out of the water) device to fill my portable computing needs.

Interestingly, some of the things I initially bought the iPad for are the same areas where the iPad falls short. I knew there would be no flash capability, and so expected this. In truth, it's not been much of an issue, and YouTube is way better on the YouTube-dedicated iPad program than it is on my flash-enabled Windows 7 laptop. But its the simple demands that are over-complicated by the iPad. Email is a bit tedious. Like the way that you can only delete one item at a time, see one folder at a time, can't do certain things like 'star' an email to make the level of importance or permanently relegate something to a junk mail category. Note: This refers to the included email program, but even if you do your email through Safari there's going to be a lot of awkward pinch-zooming to awkwardly replace the awkward lack of functions in Apple's email program. Similar issues arise with the Facebook app: It's hard to see who's online, for one thing. I can't share a story from someone else's wall to my own, and most infuriatingly -- if I post a comment, and hit enter too soon (easy to do with the on-screen keyboard layout-- backspace and send are way too close to one another) I can find no way of deleting it -- aside from opening Facebook in a browser window and trying to navigate the too-small text and awkward formatting, when this should be a an obvious and simple maneuver on the iPad app for Facebook. This is true of many apps that replace simple browsing, from eBay to Amazon to social networking. Most are beautiful, well-laid out, and missing at least one (often more) necessary function. And speaking of function, while zooming is a simple task, cutting and pasting is beyond annoying -- so much so that I often say 'hell with it' and don't bother copying things I otherwise would have. Apple needs to overhaul that function.

It is the aesthetic beauty of the iPad that rescues it from a lesser star rating based on the lack of functionality inherent in some its apps/programs. I tried the Kindle Fire in the store and found it to be visually lacking in comparison -- and much slower as well. Meanwhile, the iPad is lightening fast with just about any task you set forth to do. It makes my laptop with better specs look like a dinosaur in contrast. The screen is breathtakingly beautiful (and unless you're trying to close out lots of open apps, incredibly responsive). It's so fun to just look at that you will find yourself wanting to store a photo library on there just to view the pictures on it. I love having pictures of my kids to show off on here for the older relatives at family get-togethers. It's definitely better than a traditional photo album -- and that sentiment comes from someone who is rather old-fashioned about anti-technological items like physical photo albums. Side note: My 300 moderately-sized photos are only eating about .5g of space. Another side note: The camera, while not graphically amazing, takes some of the speediest photos I've encountered with a digital device.

Just as the iPad is able to display unparalleled beauty with photos, its video display is equally amazing. Since I care little for large-screen televisions, watching movies on here has actually made me consider getting rid of our two televisions. Netflix is convenient, the resolution and sound are perfect, and although the selection for streaming is quite limited, it fills our equally limited television needs. I haven't watched a single show on the television since I received the iPad, but I have watched the entire first season of Downton Abbey -- at my own convenience -- which was quite a luxury.

Lastly, the apps that are built *specifically* for the iPad: The games (like Contre Jour, Angry Birds, Cut the Rope), Garage Band, and Drawing Pad are awesome toys to have on hand --and affordable (as well they should be, considering the cost of the device itself). There are endless free apps to play around with, download, play with a bit and often delete -- occasionally saving the really exceptional ones. This is a great bonus to owning the iPad. My husband has an iPod touch, and the apps are far more interesting on the iPad.

There are even a number of educational apps that I didn't expect. I'm not one for computing for kids in most instances, and we stay away from all that LeapFrog and VTech madness -- instead opting for books. But I've been so impressed with apps like Solar Walk and Star Walk that I've been willing to make an exception. They're magical, and present really difficult concepts like the universe in a understandable way.

Despite the iPad having some glaring flaws, I would buy it again. I believe now -- as I did when I chose it -- that it is the best tablet available. I can't stress how much I love perfection of the display. I've been pleasantly surprised by the unexpected things which it has been so handy for. I'd have loved to have known about its flaws in advance, which is why I write this review -- I hope someone else will go into their purchase feeling more informed and confident about their decision than I felt when I ordered mine. But if I had it to do again, I am pleased to say I'd make the same decisions all over again, so it was an easy 4 stars."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I had won an iPad 2 a few months ago by filling out a survey. Overall, i am very happy with the iPad 2. It is the 32GB model, so i have the extra storage. I have at least 70 apps and 3 songs and no videos on it and i only use up about 10GB so far. The ability to back up all of your documents, apps, music, etc. ti iCloud is a great feature. You get 5GB of free storage but then you can buy additional storage if you need it.

Email
The ability to check email on it is a great feature. I use the Xfinity Mobile App instead of the mail app though so the emails will delete and be marked as read on my computer too, not just my iPad.

Web
The ability to go on the web right from my iPad is also another great feature. If i need to look something up real quick i can just use the iPad instead of waiting for my computer to boot up.

Printing
One area that the iPad does need improvement in is the ability to print from it. We originally had a WiFi printer from Lexmark but did not have Airprint in it which is what you need to print from the iPad. So, i went to the store and bought a Kodak printer that says you can print from iPod, iPad, iPhone on it. I thought that that means that it has Airprint which is what you need to print from the iPad. Come to find out it doesn't have Airprint in it, BUT, you can download an app that lets you print from your iPad. So i get the printer all set up, connect it to my network, and try out the app. You need to save a screenshot of the screen you want to print from, the send it to the app which sends it to the printer, and it worked fine. Was just hoping i could use Airprint, but maybe next time.

Flash Player
I was a little dissapointed to find out that the iPad doesn't have a flash player built in. I can't open emails with videos in it or stuff on the web that requires flash player. I think apple should put built in flash player on the iPad, beacuse if they are going to compete against the Kindle Fire which has flash player, then they should seriously consider flash player. If you need a device that has a flash player, go with Kindle Fire."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The only thing bad about this iPad2 is that it is easy to slip out of your hands so you had better get a case for it. A rubberized finish might be better. Otherwise it is just what I expected. I have the Verizon and wi-fi version.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	It's an apple product so I was forced by the mass demand to buy one and get acquainted with it.  I used it for a couple of hours and then gave it to a co-worker get acquainted with.  They looked at it for one hour and didn't like it either.	4	electronics

* easy to use
* convenient to travel
* lots of space
* digital movies

Cons:
* no flash (all Apple products)
* battery can die easily if you charge it a lot
* sometimes it doesn't work and you need to restart it

Overall:
Worth it...

B0013FRNKG	Sam's Club sell this Ipad2 64 for a $170 cheaper than what Amazon sells it for.  I would recommend that you do lengthy search before you buy it from Amazon.  This also true of the Ipad 32. It is about $100 more at Amazon than at Sam's Club.	4	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"The Apple's iPad 2 is a huge hit at our house. My wife got one and I was so jealous I insisted I needed one as well. The uses are almost limitless. Best of all it is great for creating documents (writing novels), surfing the web, listening to music, and playing Apple games. In fact I only have one complaint about the lack of compatability with the Adobe Flash Player. Because of this it keeps you from playing a great many games including those on Facebook and other sites. Additionally certain videos at some sites will only play with the Adobe Flash Player. I hope in the interest of customer needs this will change in the future. Otherwise I am very satisfied with the iPad 2. I even got a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rover-App-Controlled-Spy-Tank-with-Night-Vision/dp/B005OQYOB6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rover App-Controlled Spy Tank with Night Vision</a>&nbsp;to remotely control with the iPad so my wife and I can watch the house and cats remotely. That brings some peace of mind, not to mention the Rover is a blast to play with.

You can purchase cases and accessories to attach your iPad to your cars headrest to allow others to watch movies while traveling. There are a plethora of accessories for the iPad 2 so you will have plenty to choose from for covers, cases, adaptors, keyboards, et cetera. There are numerous apps that you can download to make it great for work and/or play. The apps can be free or range up to about twenty dollars on average. Most those I got were free or around four to seven dollars. I use mine extinsively because I can carry it anywhere and I don't have to sit at a desk to work on projects or listen to music and play games. If you're a highly mobile person this is a must have tool/toy.

I imagine most students want one to make their homework easier to work on at school or home. Because of the decent drive space and WiFi you can almost do anything that you could do on a full size workstation whether you use a PC or Mac. Since you can even buy cases with keyboards it can easily replace a laptop for a lot less money and portability. Small enough to carry in a daily planner or purse it wins hands down in portability. Since you can now back files up on the web and use webmail it alleviates the headaches of more complex and costly workstation choices. You will still require a workstation to interface with for printing, transferring some files, USB transfers, and certain other functions. But at least when you need portability you will have it.

Addendum: Although I am slightly disappointed that the iPad 3 came out on the heals of my purchase, I can't complain really as mine was purchased more for functionality than graphics.  One reader asked me if the WiFi was an issue to set up.  I didn't have any trouble with it.  In fact it's far easier than setting it up on a PC.  Once you set it up it automatically goes out and looks for a connection and will ask you which server to connect.  The beauty of it is if you decide you don't want to pay a monthly fee is you can just disable it until you want to use that feature again.  Now that the price has dropped on them, unless you need high resolution for movies or graphics, I recommend you seriously consider the iPad 2.

I'm so happy that I have an ipad 2. The ipad 2 makes all the good stuff in iPad, very very good. Extremely thin, a lot thinner than the first iPad. iPad 2 is unbelievably thin when compared to other Android and WebOS tablets. Apple has done a nice job maximizing the use of internal space to create this extremely slim device. The addition of the cameras and the new speaker design are among the visible signs of change but overall the iPad 2 feels very much like the first generation ipad.

Performance: Top notch thanks to its new A5 chip

Cameras: Not so good. Seemed to be added in as an afterthought. This was probably the only ding against it.

Accessories: Plenty of options!

This is a really useful tool for everyday uses."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"We love our Ipad2 but was shocked how easy it was for our young son to order 200.00 in games without our consent.  He is too smart for his own good.  Hard to tell if he realizes this comes out of mommy's bank account!

If your eye's are in need of reading glasses you will certaintly need them for the ipad2.  It is very small writing even though you can adjust the text I find it annoying.  I think this is a great expensive gift for a ten year old and above.  Do not give out your password!"	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"This iPad 2 is my first tablet. I got 64g wifi + AT&T 3G in white. I plan to use wifi only and add 3G at times I think I might need it.

The iPad2 comes with some fantastic apps. and many, many others are available at the App Store. Lots are free!!!

In my case the advertisements about using the iPad2 ""right out of the box without the need for a computer,"" were wrong as I had to set mine up using iTunes on my computer!

The browser is fast and no waiting for pages to load. . . with a full signal that is.  The weaker the signal on wi-fi, the slower the load but I guess that's to be expected. Dropping even one bar makes a huge difference. Also it's not compatable with Flash which is why I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars.

I love the portability, the design and mostly everything about my iPad2. But it IS costly so if you need the functionality of a laptop, this will not be a replacement. But if you just surf the web, check your e-mail and play games you'll love it!"	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"It's an Itouch or an Iphone but bigger: nothing more. I have clients contacting me wanting to get it so they can do this and that with it, and quite frankly it's not best for that.

I recently gotten one and I love it. I turn it on instantly, look something up, entertain myself with games, etc.

However it does have it's limitations, and the most annoying thing is it does not support Adobe Flash which limits you on many websites: NOT THOSE KIND OF WEBSITES!!!

I like Apple products for the most part they are a solid product. But their direction at times is completely narrow-minded like not support Adobe Flash.

For what it is I will give it 4 stars, minus one for their lack of support in other areas. Hopefully that will change one day."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"As a matter of full disclosure, I am normally a Windows OS and Android user. I won my iPad 2 as a holiday party prize from my workplace. Also, I do not own an Android tablet (yet). To avoid being labeled as a Fandroid, I will list what I liked about the iPad first (yes, there are things that Apple does well):

- the hardware design is indeed well thought out: thin, light, and nice to look at
- construction and quality appear to be top notch
- the screen display is sharp and bright
- iOS for all of its shortcoming runs very smoothly on this device
- tons of apps in the App store
- insane battery life -> This thing has the best battery life of any backlit display device I've ever used. It probably can go 4-5 days between chargings with average web usage.
- instant on -> best thing about a tablet in general: instant web browsing
- the perfect device for consuming media (Web browsing, videos, games) in bed

Now, on to what I didn't like:

- I have to use iTunes -> First thing that the tablet signaled for me to do was plug it in to the computer and install iTunes
- no back button
- Safari sucks -> First thing I downloaded from the app store was Dolphin HD
- no expandable storage (well known)
- no Flash -> sure Adobe has decided to stop supporting this for mobile devices, but for the moment there are still plenty of sites which use it. I was surprised by how many sites to which I can't view content. For a device which purports to be great at Web browsing, this kinda sucks.
- limited customization of iOS - it's a tray of icons and that's it. Barely can be called an OS.

Although I hate that the iPad doesn't have expandable storage, USB ports, etc, that is the Apple way. It always has been. The Apple ecosystem is very closed and restrictive. I am positive the iPad 3 won't have any USB ports on it either. However, the main reasons why I'm only giving this device 4 stars are: iTunes, iOS and the lack of Flash. For the amount people pay for this thing, you should be able to access 100% of the sites out there. All this being said, and it pains me to say it, Apple still has no equal in producing a sexy piece of high quality hardware. Disregarding specs (i.e. processor speed, RAM) the iPad 2 is still the benchmark hardware for tablets. Just think if this thing had flash, a USB port and you didn't need iTunes to access it from your computer. Now that would be something.

One additional comment on tablet devices in general. Nobody NEEDS one of these things. They are, in my opinion, the ultimate in media consumption (videos, e-books, games, browsing, social networking) which is the opposite of productivity. Seriously, the main reason I wanted one was so I didn't have to wait the 120 seconds it takes to boot up my laptop to browse the Web. And also so I could browse literally anywhere in my house. Definitely, these are wants and not needs. Just a thought."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I am typing this on my iPad. I prefer it to my computers it is so amazing. It helps relieve back problems!!! (: and it doesn't cause you to be regretting	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Amazing device, great for games, email, the web and the kids love it.  Only problem is the screen has cracked twice.  First time Apple was amazing and gave me a new Ipad at no charge.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	expected to receive cables with it. Didn't. Otherwise Ok. My fault, I guess for not reading properly or asking. Advice to others....... ask first.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Really big upgrade over the iPad 1.  Only downfall is I have broken 2 screens in 6 months.  Apple replaced the 1st screen at no charge, but I doubt they will fix the next one.  Glass could be stronger, but should be ok if careful.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	My order arrived faster than I expected. It seemed really easy to get it set up and start using. The only trouble I had was with iTunes and trying to get my music transferred over but I think that's me and not the iPad. So far, I'm loving it but I've only had it for a few days. Would have given it 5 stars but it cost $20 more than if I had bought it at the store. Pay the price for convenience I guess.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"emailed vendor, skeptical, reassured me that this product was new and under warranty until (date) i have forgotten the date-- anyway-- delivery was good-- secure-- I had to drive to the FedEx office and sign for the iPad2-- fine with me-- like I said-- secure
No box-- what???
cord broke on first use-- what??
no USB included--  what???
contact vendor-- he mailed new cord and USB--
good not great"	4	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"My husband ordered this item (iPad 2, 16gb, black) for work. He loves it. We still have been unable to update it to iOS 5 because our wifi kept disconnecting on wifi on laptop but I think when we do that it will be faster. First day he had some slowness but not everything is great. We looked at getting some of the tablets on the android market and went to best buy to review. I liked the idea because the androids are more customizable but had reservations because 1. They are about the same price as iPads 2. Wasn't sure if I wanted to take that risk. 3. I have iPhones and know how dependable they are. However I found the toshiba thrive and it was cheaper. So that was our main focus. Toshiba thrive vs. iPad 2. On one hand the toshiba had USB ports, sd card ports and customization options, on the other if was not familiar with it. So we tried them both at best buy. Toshiba thrive looked better. It's graphics looked more fun, apps are cheaper..mostly free and all that. But it was more complicated, which i love because I like to tween things. My husband on the other hand...does not. So he wanted iPad...I wanted toshiba thrive but we wanted to talk to somebody who knew more about it. So we grabbed a guy who only deals with tablets. He said he has an android phone and likes it but as far as tablets go he said hands down iPad won. Reason was that apple makes one specific hardware for iPads. So they had it perfected. All their apps and music were specifically made for apple hardware so it had very little problems. Android market on the other hand is made from many different tablets, that are all made by different hardware. Therefore, if an app is made on a toshiba thrive, it may work great, but if you download it for your samsung thrive, the hardware is different so you are going to have more freezes with all, crashes or lack of working at all.

In conclusion, iPad 2 so far is more dependable and perfected. I do believe however, with time, the android market will be more perfected. As of now, I am siticking with my iPad 2!"	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Great gadget. I got it as a gift and honestly, before receiving it, never thought that I would use one, especially for productivity. Well, guess what--I am using NoteTaker HD to WRITE (with stylus) down all my notes at work, I browse the web on the iPad, I watch movies on it, I watch YouTube on it, I type notes on it when I want to, I read books on it (through the Kindle app), I study on it--I can keep going for a while. No, the iPad does not replace my macbook pro at all, and I do wish that the iPad had better graphics, but for what it is right now, the iPad is by far the best tablet out there (and I've played with a few Android tablets my co-workers have) and surprisingly (very, at first) useful, both personally and professionally. And no, I am not an Apple fanboy, as I do have an Android phone (need a keyboard).

The selection of quality apps is also unparalleled."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I'm a long time Android phone user, but I decided to give Apple a try when it came to a tablet.

In trying out different tablets in person, I found most of the Android tablets to be either too heavy and/or bulky, or cheap feeling.

I also found Android 3.x (Honeycomb) to be difficult to use, and the tablets with Android 2.x just looking like a phone under a magnifying glass.  The Motorola Xoom appeared to be very well built, but a little on the heavy side.

When I tried an ipad after sifting through the sea of Android tablets at the local electronics store, I was sold instantly.  The user interface is so smooth and simple compared to Android.  I also knew that Apple products are typically less buggy than Android.  I've had a lot of difficulties with the bugginess of all my Android phones.  I may have been more courageous to try an Android tablet if more of them had support from Cyanogenmod.  As of now, there are only two Android tablets (not great ones) that they officially support.  Android 4.0 is coming soon, and looks promising, but that's yet to be seen.

The ipad is so smooth to the touch, and so comfortable in the hands... it's competitors are no match in initial impressions.

After having plenty of time to play with it, I have mixed feelings about it.

There are some drawbacks.  Every time you download something from itunes (including music, videos, apps, and books) it asks for your password (if you haven't entered it in the last 15 minutes).  It even asks for your password when downloading free items.  I understand that this was a measure to stop children from running up bills on their parents accounts, but I don't have children, and there is no way to disable this feature.

In the appstore, there are a lot of free apps, but I feel there are many more for free in the Android market.  I like free apps.  I don't like paying huge costs for hardware, then still having to pay for every little thing I need it to do.  But that appears to be the case here.  I have found some cool stuff for free, though.  It's just riddled with ads.

iOS 5.0... I guess that's the big thing right now, but I'm not that excited about it.  My ipad shipped with 4.3 and I could barely tell the difference after the update.  If they were trying to gain Android's strengths with that update, they FAILED.  iOS defnitely does have it's own strengths, though.

I am absolutely astonished at the battery life on the ipad.  I can play games all night, while connected to wifi, and occasionally streaming videos... and by some miracle, I still have plenty of battery life left.  My phone (Motorola Droid 3) would not stand for this... it's dead as a doornail before I get to 3 hours of playing games on it.

I previously owned a Kindle 3 e-reader, which persuaded me that paper books were still the best way to go.

iBooks changed my mind!  NO EXTERNAL LIGHT NEEDED! Unlike the Kindle or Nook.  You can read in the dark without disturbing your bedmate.  It actually looks and acts like an open book, too!  I'm so excited about that.  When you flip the page, you literally touch the edge of the page on the screen and flip it like a book's page!  The screen is very sharp, and brightness is adjustable to levels that are tolerable in the dark or in bright sunlight.  Honestly, it's completely worth being 3 times the cost of a Kindle just as an e-reader.

Internet browsing is terrific.  Much better than I ever expected from a mobile device.  All this bickering about iOS not using flash... it must be old news.  I've loaded flash content on both Safari and the Dolphin browser (from the app store).  What's more... flash appears to be smoother on my ipad than on my flash supported Droid 3.

Also worth noting, the ipad docks to my car stereo just like my ipod classic does.  The stereo is able to maintain control over it just as it does an ipod (I read mixed reviews about this functionality).  The surprising thing... the stereo also charges the ipad (although, I believe it's at a slower rate).

All in all, the ipad is great, but I still feel the pinch of the lack of customization that I've enjoyed with Android.  In physical form, it has no competitor.  I'm happy with my purchase.

Cyanogenmod! This is a call for a port! Dual boot!"	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I first bought a Viziotab Android tablet from Costco, then my friend bought an iPad.  Not to be outdone, I bought an iPad as well.  Now I thought I'd be using my iPad more than my Android, but this has turned out not to be the case.  You see,  Android and iPad are two very different devices, with one device often doing things much better than the other one.  So I've found myself using each device for different purposes, and I've found my Android device to be much more practical for everyday use.

Here's a summary of my findings over two weeks of using both devices:

OS Stability:  The winner here is the iPad.  I've experienced occasional freezes on the Android tablet, along with delays and slowdowns.  The only delay I've experienced on the iPad is when I'm using Safari and want to type in an address in the address bar.  There is a small delay from when I type the 'www' to when it shows up on the screen.  No big deal.

Camera:  iPad is far and away the winning choice here, especially since my Android device came with a shabby VGA camera.  I can't speak for other devices like Galaxy Tab, but the iPad with its front and rear facing cameras definitely wins.

Video Chat:  iPad.  Especially since my Android tablet doesn't, as yet, support this.

Screen Resolution:  iPad.  What can I say about this, other than the difference is like night and day.  The Viziotab's screen resolution is, in a word, ugly.  It seems very one-dimensional compared to the iPad's.  The iPad screen is clear, bright, and attractive.

Browsing:  I'm going to give this one to Android.  Although iPad's browsing is fast and Safari is easy to use, Android has flash.  Yes, I know, the resource hogging flash!  But here's the thing about flash for me: There are a couple of mission-critical websites I use constantly  one is for my job) that use flash.  With the iPad, it's a no go -- unless you buy a third-party browser that supports flash.  So Android wins here.

Photos:  This is a toss up.  While iPad blows away Viziotab in terms of resolution, Android wins simply because you don't need to go through iTunes to sync your photo library.  I think I'll be using my iPad to share those photos from my recent trip to Hawaii, but if I need to 'manage' my photos I'll use my Android tablet.

Video:  Again, a toss up.  iPad presents videos beautifully, but management is a pain in the a**.  First, iPad doesn't support all video formats.  And second, you have to sync your videos through iTunes.  So, if I have that iPad-compatible video of my trip to Egypt, I'll share it on iPad -- otherwise I'll be using my Android tablet to manage my video collection.

Email: I was at first impressed by the iPad email app.  But I enjoy reading my email on Android.  Perhaps it's the Android's integrated GMail app, which makes viewing email a more pleasant experience.  iPad just seems awkward.  Android wins here.

Downloading:  No contest here.  Android wins.  You can download anything to an Android tablet, including video and audio in multiple formats.  Android supports torrent downloading, too.  What can you download to iPad?  iTunes apps, music, and video, all of which come at a price.

Games:  iPad wins.  I just can't see Android competing in this area.  Although I'm not a big mobile-device gamer, so it doesn't really matter to me.

Bluetooth connectivity:  iPad supports Apple devices.  Android supports everyone's devices.  Android wins.

Apps:  A toss up.  App store wins for number of apps, and for integration with iPad.  Market wins for functionality.  I like ebooks, for example, and have ebooks with Barnes and Noble and Kindle.  But Apple has hamstrung the Nook and Kindle apps buy taking away the ability to download books through the iPad apps.  And there will be no app available through the app store that duplicates any other functionality that would eat iinto Apple's profits.

Viewing Videos on your HDTV:  With the purchase of a $5 HDTV cable I can view beautiful, high resolution movies and TV shows on my HDTV with my Viziotab.  With iPad you have to buy Apple TV ($99) and then are limited to iTunes store purchases.  Viziotab is the winner here.

In conclusion, I like the iPad for its big, beautiful display and ease of use.  I don't like it for its limitations, like lack of bluetooth connectivity, file management capability, and file format support.  I will keep my iPad to share videos and photos of vacations, and to use if I have to video conference with someone.  Which will probably be never, but at least it's there!  And for the cool apps that I do like.  Not so much for browsing or file management.  If I were to have to choose between the two, I would choose Android simply because it is wide open compared to iPad. If I sit on the couch to surf, I'll use Android because I know there will be no artificial barrier between me and the world wide web.  And if I go on vacation, I will take the Android with me for compatibility reasons.

Buying advice:

 If you're an Apple user already and are immersed in the Apple ecosystem of products and services, compatibility probably is not an issue for you, so I would choose iPad.  If, however, you're not an Apple user I would carefully weigh the compatibility issues.  The iPad effect wears off eventually, and you have to realize the iPad is a device that does some things really well, other things not so well, and a few things not at all.  If those things it does 'not at all' are things you need it to do, then you might be well advised to get one of the Android tablets to better serve your needs.  Or, if you're like me and can afford it, why not get both?"	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"This is one of the best ""gadgets"" I have ever purchased. It's mobile, versatile, and easy to use.  Wild have given 5 stars if it had a better camera."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I did my homework & spent months comparing tablets & laptops against the iPad2. Due to life taking it's own twist s & turns I was going to have to put off my purchase until next year. My boy friend bought me a poleroid e-reader 2 weeks ago to get me out of the living room after he went to sleep for the reading light as I'm addicted to everything Terry Prachet. Needless to say, while I was happy to be in our bedroom the e-reader is very limited in it's format & unless you know what your reading by heart your going to get lost thanks to missing text. Of course I am very thankful that he wanted to be generous & tried to be helpful but he knew I was unimpressed. So two days ago I was woken up to close my eyes & hold out my hands. He bought me the iPad2! The camera's are awesome, the size is twice as big yet the same weight as the e-reader. The already installed apps are great & navigating app store is so easy, let alone almost every site online that I have been to so far (20 of my favorite online news, shopping, weather etc.) already has a free app for the iPad2. There are a few interesting quirks though...

1) You must have a pc to install the operating system through I tunes, but you can also go to an Apple store & they will help you.
2) While it comes already installed with a YouTube app the videos aren't the best versions (due to their FLASH) but you do get the site, with most videos & songs.
3) Apple IPad2 is not compatible with adobe FLASH... Not on the apps or if you just use the safari operating system to connect to the browser of your choice.
4) No more zynga games, (Mafia Wars etc.) on Facebook if this will be your only mode of internet connection.
5) The apps pages are in most cases very cool & graphically stimulating, however I am learning going to the same site using safari will have different content. In the case of Facebook, I couldn't view the links posted by my friends to my wall when using the Facebook app.
6) The yahoo messenger app takes up the entire iPad screen & I tended to forget it was signed on to learn I was missing conversations due to web browsing... or sitting around waiting for a response.

The iPad has made the last 2 days of after dinner family movies more tolerable, as the toddlers can watch their Disney movies. While I enjoy Netflix on the couch, they sung & danced to their hearts desires without me getting frustrated that I can't see Eric & Arial get thrown out of the boat for the 5 billionth time. Bed time has been fun for us all, as they are amazed I read them a color book (The little engine that could... Free in I-books) up in thier bedroom on my, ""tiny nooooooo touchy TV"".

I LOVE MY IPAD2!!!! None of the aforementioned quirks are irritating enough to walk away, just things I don't know enough about or need to get used to. Considering the auto spell hasn't inspired me t9, I mean *59... ugh! Hasn't made me throw it out the window yet. But I can turn it off in the settings, which is a really cool feature with all kinds of settings & features I haven't fully jumped into yet.  You can buy the 500gb wifi external hard drive to store your movies & video's on, (as it's not expandable) plus share ability with up to 2 or 3 others, at the same time. So really it's only draw back is the whole Adobe Flash issue or I would think it is absolutely perfect!

I knowI will go back to using my laptop from time to time, but right now I am so excited & inspired to find all the ways I can enjoy & use this clever machine it's going to be a while."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Bought my husband an iPad 2 over the net to be able to get mine back! Ordered in Australia on a Wednesday night and had it delivered in Brisbane on the following Monday. Fantastic! The product is great, but we knew it would be. Would highly recommend	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"...but I love it!

I was skeptical at first for getting one because the specs didn't/doesn't seem to justify the price.  I have a laptop, desktop and a very good Android phone so I didn't really need this.  But I've owned many Apple products (Macs and iPods) too, but never an iOS device.  So, as a birthday gift, I wanted to splurge (haha).

Not to sound like an Apple ad/fanboy (or SJ-RIP), but I do like its `convenience.' I like that I can `lounge' with this instead of being at my desktop, having to deal with the bulk of a laptop or the small size (and power) of my smartphone.  The touchscreen is very responsive and the image quality (be it pictures, web pages, video-especially HBO) is great.  There is little to understand or setup (except connecting it to your wifi, if you got a wifi only; if you know/use Apple, Android or Windows, you'll figure it out easily).  I got a 32 gig because I wasn't sure what my ratio would be for apps vs. media/pic content (even with Apple's cloud service).

Granted, it has some limitations (be it lack of `flash,' getting used to the onscreen keyboard and some multi-tasking capabilities), but its conveniences do make up in its usefulness (that is, if you use it for web surfing, checking email, using apps, etc).  I've had to stop myself at times from saying `I'm doing those things on such a thin device'-haha.

I'll say that this is a very good `half-top,' that is, half a desktop/laptop.  It isn't to replace my computer or smartphone, but I do find myself using this more in leisure than my actual computer (haha).  I know there are less expensive tablets and/or tablets with better software/hardware specs.  But this device is a delight to have when/if you don't want to use your smartphone or computer."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"This is a refurbished item and it started having problems on the same day the return window expired; the rotation feature is broken and I will have to get it fixed at my cost because I have been unable to contact the vendor. When the item arrived it didn't include any type of warranty. So I now have a one month old i-pad that doesn't work properly. I am not prepared to give a positive review and I do not appreciate the difficulty in contacting the vendor directly. This is Bargain Devices, sponsored by Amazon.

UPDATE

Actually it turns out that all I needed to do to correct this problem is to reset the i-pad to factory standards using i-tunes; the apple people were patient and helpful and it didn't take too long.  Apparently this is a common problem but fairly easy to solve. I am now very happy with my i-pad"	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Great product, only complaint is the price of the product. It's almost the same price as a fully functioning laptop that is flash enabled.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Why has the price for the iPAD 1 not fallen since the introduction (what? 6 months after 1) of the ipad 2? I like my ipad 1 and have been waiting for the price to come down to buy one for my wife. Just curious why the prices are essentially the same. Maybe Christmas sales?	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I recently received the Apple iPod 2 as a birthday gift. Since I never had the iPad 1 I'm still learning how to use it, although it is somewhat similar to my 3rd generation iPod touch. The iPad 2 has a lot of nice features built in such as a video/picture camera and FaceTime. What I really don't like about my iPad is that I can't download Adobe or watch shows on Hulu or any other website without paying fees. These are things that I can do on my regular laptop at no extra cost. Apple is forcing the iPad purchasers to use iTunes or to pay extra fees elsewhere. If I had known this from the start I would have returned the iPad and bought a tablet. If you don't like watching videos online or you don't mind paying extra fees then the iPad is great. As for me I am not happy with it.

Update 12/28/11: iPad now offers Apps for ABC and TV.com for CBS so I can watch shows from these networks for free and I don't have to purchase them from iTunes. The iPad is still restrictive compared to some tablets, but I'm going to change my rating from 2 stars to 4 stars. iPad is equal or superior to most tablets currently on the market, but I just wish that it wasn't so restrictive in some cases."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Responsive and very light. I recommend, however, if you've never used an iPad, or for that matter, any Apple hardware device, you go to Apple.com and download the user manual. Apple's intellectual property security fetish is problematic if you have info on more than one laptop(s) or desktop(s) that you'd like to load on the iPad (music libraries especially). If you're a PC user, then the upload process for images is absolutely not straight forward. Copying photos takes some trial and a lot of error going from PC to iPad. Also, the version of Safari on the iPad isn't similar to the laptop/desktop screen. There's no tools header. Over all, if you want a book reader or an expensive PDA, this is the device for you.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"While the iPad 2 is indeed the coolest gadget to own at the moment, it hardly does anything productively. This is not to say I do not love my iPad 2. I use it to watch Netflix, type company notes, play games, and occasionally listen to music on it. That is precisely where I find the problem. I use it to do things I do perfectly fine on a computer or laptop. I can watch Netflix, take notes, game, music on my computer and it does an even better job! The truth is, I often have to find an excuse to use my iPad 2 instead of getting on my laptop.

So why iPad 2? Because it's a luxury item and everything looks more beautiful on an iPad 2. At least that's what you'll convince yourself, well, I did..."	4	electronics

It's really lame that we have to suffer because Steve Jobs wants to fight with Adobe. Good grief! College students still need access to flash presentations since many college instructors provide voice over PowerPoint as flash output via a Web page. There really is no other viable option.

B0013FRNKG	"Who needs a netbook or even a laptop as a second computer? Well at least not me. Two weeks ago I decided to buy an ipad 2, so I went to Best buy and bought one. I have no iphone or ipod touch, I have a imac 21.5, a white macbook and ipod classic, then this was my first experience with IOS, which is super easy to use. Aesthetically it is a beautiful piece of design, no bright LEDs, and only a few buttons. since I bought my ipad 2. I have not used my macbook and it is much more practical to take with me. Common uses are videos, web browsing, email, internet radio and some games, no music stored, because most of my audio files are lossless, the battery lasts 2 to 3 days, not really a heavy use, But still ok .

Cons in my point of view:

No expandable sd card.
No flash on camera.
Cameras not very good.
Glossy screen.
No flash player.

Pros:

Size is excellent.
Software easy to use.
Too many apps
Design.
Many more accessories than its competitors.
Portability.

In short almost a great product, and waiting  for iOS5 and iCloud."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I love it but it has some annoying downfalls.  These include the lack of Flash Player and the limited ability to print.  The lack of Flash is really a problem because there are still many sites that use Flash technology. Really, really annoying.
Although printing is only possible with a select few Canon printers, I am not going out of my way to purchase a Canon printer just so I can print from my iPad.

The GOOD stuff:
The really great thing about this device is when you turn it on, Bam!  It's on.  No wait time, no boot up time.

iPad vs Kindle.
Initially I bought the iPad as an e-reader because the experience is much superior when compared to the Kindle.  The touch screen is much more book like, turning pages with your finger is much more intuitive than pushing a button.  The scrubber at the bottom of the page so you can slide to any page, where as the Kindle you have to push a button or use the ""go to"" function and type in the desired page.  iPad lets you know what page and chapter name you're on rather than just a percent, the Kindle gives no chapter name or page number.  Every issue the Kindle has is addressed with the iPad.  The color screen is much better than the Kindle e-ink screen.
***********************
3G and GPS Chip.
I am very glad I have these options.  When ever you want access the internet in remote areas via 3G, just go the ""settings"", cellular data and log in and turn on that option.  So for the next 30 days at $15 you have internet access.
The GPS chip is included with the 3G.  There are GPS apps for free, Waze and Motion X GPS Drive for purchase.  With the 3G option you need to turn on the Cellular Data in order for the GPS to work.

Waze app is free and is pretty accurate but it did give me incorrect directions but it can only get better since the information is user generated.  Just driving around with Waze turned on generates information for other drivers.  It has voice guidance but does not give specific street names.  It is good in showing road conditions, traffic, hazards, etc....

Motion X Drive app is 99 cents and just as good or better than Garmin.  It has many options and gives two different female voices for guidance, nothing really sexy.  It also states the street names but must be purchased for either $3 for 30 days or $20 for one year.  It also gives road conditions but Waze probably does a better job.

B0013FRNKG	"First, let me explain the 4 stars instead of five. I find the ipad too heavy to hold when reading. Perhaps that can't be helped. It certainly is not heavy in the real sense of the word. It's easy to carry with you anywhere. But to hold it upright for long periods like you do the Kindle is not what it was made for. So, I read my books on the Kindle.

That aside, I used to think the iPad was an expensive toy. I was wrong. I use it for my business and investments and have yet to play a game on it. I get streaming quotes and financial news and instant updates. Apple has so many apps that you'll find exactly what you want. I have lots of fitness and exercise apps that help me keep my health in check.

Lots of people have written in-depth reviews on the iPad and I'm not going to try and do the same thing. I merely want to say that this is a powerful device that can put power in your hands and add a lot to your business and personal life.

Apple support is decent but you can't get refunds for apps you don't like or that don't work for you. That's a major con and very much unlike Amazon. Also, Apple's site --- iTunes --- is hard to navigate. But those are the only cons I've found thus far.

A word of advice: While 16gb is a considerable amount of space for books, etc, you may regret not getting more memory. I do. Just the apps alone (if you buy a lot of them as I did and most people do) take up lots of space. And video uses lots of memory. I didn't think I'd keep many videos on my iPad but I do. I'm now using about three-forths of my memory and I've only had the device about a month or less. I can assure you that next time I'll spend a bit more and buy more memory and you might want to consider that as well.

Highly recommended.

B0013FRNKG	"The iPad 2 has got to be one the best things I have ever owned. In the start I thought I never ""needed"" just wanted it. But now I cant see myself not living without one. I hardly use my 17inch desktop replacement now. I only use it for certain tasks like downloading files, converting files, heavy typing tasks and pc gaming. I also hardly use my HTC Deire Android smartphone or iPod touch 3rg gen for surfing or apps any more when Im home. After trying many different tablets and reading many reviews and lastly just playing around with the iPad 2, I knew it was the best tablet on the market right now. Yes it does have many drawbacks if you compare it to the other tablets, but the it also has many great things about it and pros greatly outweigh the cons. Coming from an iPod touch i was already familiar with iOS. I also plan on getting an iPhone as my next smart phone. I prefer iOS over android and other operating systems for mobile devices. iOS just works and flows really well. Its really reliable and easy to use. Any body any age can pick an iOS device especially an iPad and just start using it right away, its just that easy. I do really wish the iPad 2 had flash but over time I got used to it. Also there are many work around for watching or using flash on the iPad 2. Their are at least 10 different apps/browsers that will allow you to use flash on your iPad 2. Also over time flash will die. It is a aging format, it drains too much battery and memory and its slow and most of all there's all sorts of security issues with it. I know since I use adobe flash on my htc desrie all the time. Also many websites, I would say as much as 75% of them offer 2 choices html 5 or flash versions of their website. I also wish the iPad 2 had a higher resolution screen. Many of the other android tablets do have a higher resolution. They also have better cameras, more ram and dual speakers. Regarding the screen I haven't noticed that the resolution is an issue right now any way all videos, web pages, apps and games look great on it. Also the speaker is gerat even though its just one on the bottom right, its still fairly loud and does the job. In terms of performance I don't find the iPad 2 slow in any way even though it has less ram than the other tablets on the market. Here is where the iPad 2 excels when compared to its competitors: The battery life is just crazy at 10 hours, yes at times I do wish the battery was removable so I could just swap another but its just really long lasting. The iPad 2 is supper light especially when compared to the other tablets or even the previous iPad. At first I found it a little on the heavy side and I do still wish it was a little bit lighter like around 1 pound, which Im sure the next will be. I think there is only one tablet which is lighter than the iPad 2 and that's the samsung galaxy tab 10.1. The iPad 2 has the best app store. It has the most apps, the best quality apps, and the developers make the apps for apple first before android, blackberry or windows 7 phone. Apple also has the largest store to purchase music, music videos, tv shows and movies. You can also rent movies on it. The iPad 2 has the best selection of games out of all the other tablets. Their are tons of games free and paid on the iPad 2. The iPad 2 just like any other product has huge number of third party accessories available for it. Apple has great customer service and a great warranty. I do have to warn you that when I received my iPad 2 in the first week of may. I had purchased it online from appples website and it was shipped to me in 3 weeks directly form the factory in china. I was aware that their maybe a backlight bleeding issue on some iPad 2s. It turns out mine had it and I wouldn't have known if I wasn't on the forums. I went into an apple store and the genius replaced it on the spot. Mind you I did get a refurbished model. But the refurbished replacement was flawless with no backlight bleeding and haven't had any issues with it yet. So I caution you to maybe wait until they say for sure that they have fixed the defect with all iPad 2s and then make the purchased. Or you can make your purchase now and see if you get a defective one or not. Overall I am very happy with my iPad 2. I do suggest going for highest memory option you can afford especially if your gonna use it for more than just browsing and email. The apps and games do add app and its always nice to have that extra storage available. Also if you can afford the extra $100 for the 3G connectivity I do suggest that also. That is one feature I wish I had got. I seem to use my iPad 2 mostly at home but when I'm out I do wish I have the 3G since I have to use my smartphone as a hotspot and use up its battery and data. If you get the one with 3G you can always just sign up for no contract data and just turn the plan on and off whenever you really need it with no commitments. Lastly, the iPad 2 does have the antenna gate issue which lowers the signal of the data connection of the device when holding it a certain way. I disappointed to hear this, but its seems these days almost any mobile device has some sort of issue like this. I have noticed it on my 2 ipod touchs and htc desire and now the iPad 2. It happens when you hold down on the speaker grill on the bottom left of the iPad 2. I have noticed it only drops the signal by one bar. So if I have 3 bars on wifi then it drops 2 bars. It there is only one bar then it doesn't drop the connection. I have also done a speed test and it slows down the speed by about one third. It never seems to affect streaming video or music for me. The iPad 2 is a great device I don't regret buying it all. I could just bought a cheap netbook but I a tablet. I was never even a fan of the iPad when it first came out, I thought it was just an over sized iPod touch which I already had. Also I was never a big follower of apple products, yes, I have owned a couple of iPod touchs but that's about it. I was also never a fan of the iPhone just found it over rated. But now after owning the iPad 2 for almost 3 months I can honestly say it is the coolest thing I have ever owned.

December 2011 update: Well after owning the iPad 2 for about 7 months I can say its a great device but not good enough. The iOS 5 update made this worse in many ways especially battery life. The device is also more buggy now. Alot of the new features work but don't work right or all the time. I did update to 5.01 and battery life as improved but not to what it was before 5.0. I am anxiously awaiting a worthy tablet from google. The lack of flash, not having real multitasking, not being able to modify or customize my tablet in any way, not having micro sd card or usb ports really makes me wanna get an android based tablet. As soon as there is an android tablet that is just as good as the iPad 2 or better I will be getting it and selling this iPad 2. In the mean time I guess I will have to just deal with the limitations of an iOS device. Jailbreaking my iPad 2 did improve the usability of it alot but then I updated to iOS 5 and I no longer have a jailbreak. Jailbreaking still doesn't compare to the hack-ability and customization an android device is capable of especially if rooted.

April 2012 update: aftering owning my iPad 2 for almost a year now I am still very happy with it. When I first wrote my review I thought maybe the an android tablet would be better for me. Since then I tried the asus transformer prime and found out the grass is not greener on the other side. The asus prime was buggy, had all sort of glitches. I wasn't happy with the hardware or software especially after using an iPad. The lack of tablet specific apps was also very limited. The only thing I miss from the prime was the keyboard dock which provided extra battery life, extra ports and a hardware keyboard. There is still nothing like this for the iPad. All the keyboards are Bluetooth and end up draining the iPads battery quicker. There is the apple keyboard dock but only works in portrait mode and can only be used on desk or flat surface.

The iPad 2 is even better than before now since the price has been reduced to $400 and you can get a refurb unit for only $350. Personally I think the refurb should be $300. But $350 is still a great price and ofcourse people will still buy it at that price. I don't really see a point in upgrading to the newer iPad. I played around with it in the store and yes it did look better but only when you put the two of them next to each other. They say only people who use their iPad for videos and gaming will really benefit from the better screen. The newer screen is also suppose to reduce eye strain for reading.  The iPad is still the best tablet on the market and will continue to be so for a while at least until google finally gets their act together and produce a comparable tablet.  Androids lack of tablet apps and fragmentation is really killing and holding google back from competing with Apple."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I'll make this short & to the point, as others have reviewed the iPad & iPad 2 numerous times to count.  The iPad 2 was a birthday gift.  It works as advertised & reviewed.  After I jailbreak it, it can do more =0p...	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"""This sunlight is OK, I guess, I mean it provides all my food I suppose, but I have to give it zero stars out of 5 because I danced naked outside one day and it totally gave me a sunburn.""

I swear, this is what it sounds like when people complain about new technology.  Is there an astounding amount crammed into a small, considerably weight-reduced package? A resounding yes.  Are there some pretty impressive apps available for it?  Per this review's title, yes.  Is it a completely effective replacement for meaningful human contact?  No, but I'm reserving judgement for when generation 3 arrives with an optional mounting harness for love dolls.

Look, its not perfect...realistically, it'll be a solid 4 or 5 years before a device in this price range can match the 160 gigs of an ipod classic with flash memory, and the dual core chip, while fine for day to day maneuvers, can lag in the more intensive tasks (not that there are many apps that convert things to DivX format or remotely control nuclear cooling towers).  Additionally, the lack of slots for SDHC or its 'micro' version knocks off a point or two for versatility.  Once data is on the thing, your only hope of exporting is via email or with third party software (and be REALLY careful to test it out with nothing crucial already installed, as there are some abysmal titles out there).  Also, I feel a decade of that proprietary cable is enough.

Gripes aside, this thing is a joy to use.  The battery is every bit as good as people claim, my average use per charge is right between 11 and 12 hours.  No screen protector was included, but aftermarket options are plentiful, and the matte finish option I tried produces an incredibly natural response, especially when using a stylus.  Need to entertain a child 1-3 years of age?  Furry Friend is a fantastic app, and less than 2 dollars in the full version.  Splashtop, though, is the primary component of the 5 stars.  Full version is fairly inexpensive (intermittently goes on sale for 1.99), and it has saved me both time AND monitor life; Splashtop is remote control for your PC or MAC...nothing new there, those in the IT world have been doing this for some time, and its one of the features advertised for Windows 7 in particular.  But the versatility is the selling point.  You could be stuck at an airport, and edit a slew of photographs, browse on Firefox with your home presets/favorites, access anything your home computer can access, all with intutitive touch controls.

With the sum of available science today, one could certainly design a device with more features and performance.  Sure it would cost a ridiculous sum, but ultimately, you get what you pay for.  I am a PC guy (only in computer preference), but I have to admit this is an impressive slab of glass and aluminum.  As for those claiming the purchase of an Apple product will designate you as a sheep or conformist, I applaud your staunch independence...just be sure you avoid any Meat, Fruits, Grains and Vegetables grown more than 50 miles from you, switch to a all-recycled burlap wardrobe, Handcraft your furniture from sustainably harvested logs downed with your own teeth, coat the whole thing with cruelty-free mud, and power your domicile with a small windmill and excercise bike hooked up to a homemade turbine.  Also, avoid all non-leg-based transportation.  Then you can be a true pioneer!"	4	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"The iPad2 64GB 3GS (""iPad2"" in this review) really is a nice-to-have device.  For various reasons I did not have an original iPad despite wanting one, so this review will focus on the iPad2 and not the differences between the two generations.

1.  Screen.  The Screen on the iPad2 is gorgeous.  HD movies really do look HD, and the iPad2 provides a very satisfactory viewing experience.

2.  Battery life:  Very good.  Despite moderately heavy ""on the road"" use, I have never managed to run my battery even to 50%.  Others are reporting 11-12 hours and this is consistent with what I am seeing.  Apple did a good job with this battery, and the overall power management of the iPad2.  I have my screen set to auto-dim (where the screen adapts to the lighting in the room) and no doubt this helps.  I have never needed or wanted to fiddle with the screen using this setting.  Ordinary Apple chargers work fine to charge the iPad2 battery.  However, many computer USB ports do not have enough juice to charge the iPad2.  My main Windows computer does not; not even from a powered USB hub.  Many third-party chargers for the iPhone turn out not to work with the iPad2 although all of the Apple ones I have tried do, and some of the after-market ones do.  So far my experience has been that if they sold it in the Apple store, it works.

3.  Browsing the web.  The iPad2 is peerless for just plain web browsing, and this is what it excels at.  The virtual keyboard is OK for short email messages or filling in fields on websites.  For more heavy duty typing, there are a number of fine outboard keyboards out there.  I was delighted to find that my Apple Bluetooth Keyboard works splendidly with the iPad2 and for road trips I pack it along.

4.  Cameras.  There are two; front and back.  They are exactly what you would expect: OK for quick snapshots, but a lens a fraction of an inch in diameter is not going to take the place of a real camera; we all know that.  They work reasonably well for what they are.  I have not yet tried the various videophone applications so I cannot speak to that.

The iPad2 is thin and easy to carry.  The Apple case, which many people buy, is nice to have, but it does not protect the back of the iPad.  There are any number of aftermarket leather or other kinds of cases that provide the iPad2 with more protection.  Most of these will cause the iPad2 to power down when the front flap is closed, just as the Apple cover does.  This is a very nice feature.

The iPad2 has infinite professional and personal uses.  I can have it in the courtroom (I am an attorney) and look up cases on-line quickly and snappily using the 3GS, since most courtrooms do not provide counsel with Wi-Fi.  Email, Web access, etc., these things are all becoming a fundamental part of our lives.  I used to use my iPhone for portable Web access, and it was OK for that, but the iPad2 with its larger screen is infinitely better for this.  In my life Web access wherever I go is the main use for the iPad2, and it is a critical use.

My main negative on the iPad2 are these: 1.  No dedicated USB2 port.  Why not? 2.  The lack of a USB port makes it very difficult to print anything with the iPad2 and for some reason Apple does not make printing easy, or hardly even possible.  Apple flat-out does not encourage or want its iPad2 users to print off of their iPads.  Whether they are trying to protect their notebook sales or there is some other reason, I do not know.  Eventually I anticipate that competition and pressure from the user base (me!) will force Apple to relent on this.

In the 21st century, devices like the iPad2 are destined to become a fundamental part of our personal kit.  The iPad2 is beautifully made, and for most of us very much worth having.  Highly recommended.  RJB."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Whether you are a Windows user or a Mac user like myself, you will find that the Apple's IPad 2 is incredibly easy use. Heck, I taught my grandmother how to use it in an hour and she has no grasp of technology whatsoever.

Customize
One can customize the placement of their applications based on how often that one uses them, by category, by favorite, or however ones wants, you can completely customize the order of your apps.

Camera and Weight
The IPad 2 is thinner then its predecessor as well as lighter, it also includes a front and rear camera which makes video chatting via Facetime efficient. However, the quality of these cameras are nowhere near the standards that one expects to see from a piece of technology, especially at the price that Apple charges. Apple cites that the small mega-pixel camera is the result of a thin design, which I understand. I do not use my IPad to take pictures, I do however carry it everywhere. It's thin and light design enables me to slip it in to that last little space of room in my backpack without adding much weight.

Media and Graphics
For those of you that are on the go, you can use the IPad for games, music, videos, and even writing word documents. I however, do not like watching movies on my IPad, because any movie that comes from Itunes is only in wide screen format which makes the actual movie frame very small. That and the not so great quality of movie graphics, makes me reluctant to do so. The graphics on the IPad 2 are good when not watching movies, when watching they are are not terrible but they are not great, and can be vastly improved.

The Keyboard
What bothers me the most about the IPad 2 is the keyboard, the letters are shrunk so that the keyboard can fit, but it was not done proportionally. The lack o  a quick transition between symbols, numbers, and letters makes note taking inefficient on the IPad 2."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I work a lot away from home/office and wanted to buy a Kindle and a netbook, but a friend suggested an iPad instead.  I was not sure that the cost was worth it, but, so far, I'm enjoying it.  It's nice not having the weight of my laptop on my shoulder.  And it's good to have the Kindle app as I love to read.
Two negatives for me - of course everyone comments on the lack of Adobe flash and this is a problem for me as some of the websites that I must access use this feature.  Second I MUST be able to read pdf documents.  I downloaded iBooks then purchased pdfReader Pro and still cannot read the working document for a meeting in London; this is the main reason that I bought the iPad - to avoid having to travel with a laptop - so I'm very disappointed!"	4	electronics

B0013FRNKG	I was looking to either pick up an ipad 2, blackberry playbook, or the asus transformer. I decided to go the ipad 2 because of ios. It has it's limitations such lack of flash, more expensive, non extendable storage, not as many ports, and I'm sure there is more. I don't care much for apple hardware specs because it's competitors usually will give more bang for the buck. I bought it mainly for ios. With ios I can feel confident there will be updates and future support for the next few years unlike blackberry or a windows tablet. I really wanted to get an adroid device, but the lack of security and hardware optimization and support made me go with apple. Apple does have security issues (pdf exploit) but that was fix with the 4.3.4 ios update. I can always count on talking to someone when I need support (within my warranty). I was bleh and asked myself why didn't I go with an adroid device when I first got the ipad 2, but as I start using it I am liking it more and more.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"The product arrived late but I have enjoyed it ever since then. I am new to apple/Mac so I am getting accustomed to al, that it can do.
I travel alot, so this small device helps considerably with space and weight, still allowing me to surf the net and chat with folks regularly online.
Hope this helps."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Not being a techno-whiz, I need all the cue cards I can get. No cue cards w/ the iPad (original). No instruction book. Even w/ tutorials, lots of info re how to download ($),but no basics like how to access and play the music you have downloaded. Took LOTS of trial and error to figure out.
On the up side, having a store nearby to take 1:1 classes is wonderful, and will learn much in short order.
One other concern, I downloaded Sketchbook Pro to learn to draw in the computer. Present iPad technology requires a stylus pen w/ an eraser tip for iPad to ""read"" the marks you make. Any way to make a different type of interface sensitivity (pressure  vs electrical charge of skin) to enable a finer tip as needed? Yes, one can choose tips and brushes, but requiring so much surface of the eraser tip to create a line seems inefficient. Perhaps a wacom tablet would have been a better choice.
Overall, it is amazing to have music, mail, drawing, search, calendar etc in such a small package.  The problems...no doubt more my abilities than the product."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I love my Ipad 2.  It is so light, so convenient and so full of promise that I don't think I'll ever get tired of it.  Actually, I'm a PC person and I have ALOT to learn about using the Apple technology, but so far, I think it's been worth diving into.  The camera has very good resolution and even I was able to take some good movies. I bought this instead of a laptop because I find the touch screen to be soooo intuitive.  I think that's really the best part.  I had a little trouble getting the email system up and running because I'd ordered it through the internet and there's not an Apple Store nearby to set up the product initially.  However,it comes with several months free telephone help and the tech person who assisted me was very patient, skilled and spoke impeccable English. My biggest issue is the delicate touch and size difference of the keyboard compared to a laptop but I am getting real fast at hunt and peck typing- though I may consider buying an auxillary keyboard.  I would definitely recommend the IPAD 2.

B0013FRNKG	I love my Ipad2. It is fast, very reliable and stable, and just plain fun.  But there are a few things that keep it from being perfect.  First, as other reviewers have commented, the camera is the pits and really not up to Apple's ususal outstanding quality.  The second issue, in my opinion, is the slick aluminum back side material.  It looks pretty but really necessitates a case because it is slippery and without a means to get a better grip, it is only a matter of time before the inevitable fall.  I found the same problem with my Iphone.  It would be a much better devise if Apple used a rubberized type material on the back.  I spent alot of time comparing the Ipad2 with the Motorola Xoom at Best Buy before making my purchase, and I really don't think you could go wrong with either tablet.  The Xoom has a far better camera and does flash which might be a big plus if you are really into video and gaming. But flash also comes at a cost in performance and stability which is exactly why Apple doesn't use it.  The Ipad2 seems more intuitive to me and just seems to work better and do things quicker. But I have to admit that my familiarity with Iphone may partly influence my opinion on that point. Ipad also has many more apps available at the moment. One other drawback though,in my opinion, is the need to tether the Ipad to Itunes. I understand their logic, but I really wish it had a simpler PC-Ipad interface. Honestly if I didn't already have an Iphone I might have been inclined to buy the Xoom, but that's not taking anything away from the Ipad2 - it is a great tablet!	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"it is a great item that can be enjoyed just about anywhere.  The problem with the ipad2 is it doesn't support FLASH.  Steve Jobs has this problem with flash and won't let it be used on the iPad.  Well, Steve should get over it, concentrate on himself and Apple should provide services that customers want.  I can not Downlod many email messages because the attachments are in flash.  I did not know this when I bought it.  It should be very clearly posted in the store and on the the box.
Had i knows this I would have purchased the XOOM.
THINK ABOUT THIS BEFORE YOU BUY BECAUSE IT IS FRUSTRATING."	4	electronics

B0013FRNKG	It's a great gadget. Very easy to use, even my 1 n 1/2  years doughter can use it, not kidding. The only three downsides I see  are the camera (very bad resolution), the flash problem and some of the apps are really expinsive.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I have an iPhone 4 with retina display, and I supposed (my bad) the iPad2 had it as well, I was wrong. The display is not as good as the iPhone 4, however it is a decent display.

Also, if you have an iPhone or an iPod Touch, then you probably don't need it.

The apps are great, every day you have more and more amazing apps.

Also, if you are considering to buy one, try to wait for March or April 2012 for the iPad 3.

Thank you!"	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I ordered a white 64GB WiFi with tan leather cover the first day it was available so I've had it for about 3 months. Now I hardly use my iPod Touch 4 since the keyboard is so much bigger and easier to use. I use it mostly at work on the WiFi network to access sites that are blocked on the company's PC network, for example email accounts I have. At home I love playing the games, using it with my Apple TV to play music and video.

THE COOL:
The iPad2 is wicked fast.

Apps are awesome. So many cool games. Adrenal Golf, War Pinball, Plants vs. Zombies

Apps that use GPS are cool. 4 square, Yelp, Google maps

Apps for video chat, Skype and FaceTime is way cool. I chat with my friend who has an iPad2 300 miles away over our WiFi networks and the performance is near flawless. He called me on FaceTime from a train station in Beijing and from a Starbucks in China. Truly amazing.

Apps for social networking. Facebook, 4 square, twitter, Flipboard is way cool

Apps for news, Fox, CNN, Free video from Crackle, Netflix if you have it

Air Video is way cool - you can play movies in different formats to your HDTV using Apple TV or the HDMI adapter.

Dlink has a security app that allows me to view a webcam in my house from anywhere I have Internet.

Textfree for iPad for texting.

NOT SO COOL:
The smart cover with magnets is cool but it's a bit awkward and takes a bit getting used to.
The back camera is very low resolution but what are you going to do use an iPad to take photos?
The speaker isn't that great. I bought some SoundMatters little speakers which are pretty cool.

Overall I'd highly recommend it."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I bought the Ipad with the intent of playing some of the internet games I play on my HP.  I found out that they are not compatible in this arena, so I was disappointed.  It does however fill all other responsibilities that I use a computer for.  It is light weight and holds a charge for a very long while.  It is great as long as you don't expect to use it  far all of your HP abilities.	4	electronics

B0013FRNKG	"I've done a ton of research on tablets, and ultimately decided on the iPad 2. I like the customization of android, but in the end it came down to the stability and the vast amount of apps. Before considering buying an iPad I was wondering why people would not shut up about how many apps there are, well now I really do get it. While some of them aren't very useful for me, there are quite a few i would say that are very well designed and extremely useful and just plain entertaining.

I really hated the fact that there was no flash, and no true multiple tasking, but after taking a chance on the iPad I realized I really didn't notice the flash too much, however, the lack of true multitasking can be frustrating at times. The iOS definitely needs an update, but for the first time user it will be a pleasurable experience.

The quality of the ipad is incredible, and the experience from startup to actually using the device was impressive to say the least. The screen is beautiful and the screen is extremely responsive. Oh, and not to forget, the battery life is unreal at a true ten plus hours of browsing and streaming video and audio.

The Internet browsing experience is very nice, I've had no issues at all. The web pages render perfectly and overall is a blast to use ( even without flash).

I would whole heartily recommend the iPad 2 to anyone seeking a device that allows you to browse the web, check email, play games, check and pay bills, loves creating anything at all, or just wants to sit on the couch and watch some Netflix. The iPad isn't flawless but at this price it is very fair for what you get. If you are looking to totally replace your laptop, it's possible, but it just depends on what you really use it for. I personally replaced my laptop with this device and never looked back.

Hope this helps."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Is an excellent gadget  for de office people, administrator places,  or just to entreteiment. It's like a big iPhone so if you alredy have one an iPad could be less useful.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I recieved the tablet after 4 day from purchasing and it was perfect but i was shocked when i relized it's cheaper here ofcourse this is my problem. Anyway thank you.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Bought this Ipad 2 for my wife as a birthday gift and she loves it. I wish the 5meg camera took better pictures. But a great system to check emails, surf the net, etc, etc. Ipad 2 is very fast and main connection excellent.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I give them 4* for effort. But where are you gonna fit this tablet. Believe me not EZ. And priced still high. A T & T where not able to answer my technical support questions either. Simple stuff like my range of internet access. Can I piggy back or I'M confused puppy. Someone that knows clarify. Lets start a dialog.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I have an iPhone 4, but it's screen is not wide enough to enjoy many US TV shows that are available online.  With Apple's iPad 2, I am really enjoying them, although I can not see a full episode since they are limited to the States and it's territories.  What a shame!	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	My Ipad was deliveried in right time in good conditions, but I miss the ticket and I worry about warrant	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	The Verizon models does not have neither a GSM SIM card, nor an IMEI number. This detail is very important for the buyers outside of the Verizon coverage, or people who want to use this item in another country.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I Purchased My Ipda2 which I found It Amazing Product I recommended for EVRY ONE,
But only My mistake is I ordered 3G with Verzion which is built in sim and You can't use other sim"	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	I am usually known as the Apple hater, but I did cave in and buy the Ipad 2. That being said... I like it, I would like it better if it were flash capable and if it had a USB port. Also I think that although you can purchase data if you have the 3G version without signing up to a contract... I think it sucks that if you don't use that purchased amount in 30 days you lose it. Damn!!Why can't I keep it until I use it up? That prompted me to purchase the Wifi version only (Either it is pay as you go or it is not) with Apple IT IS NOT. Things like that continue to make me a Apple shall I say... disliker if thats a word. All in All I will say I am enjoying the Ipad, I've only had it a week so give me time I might change my mind.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	It is a very easy to use and handy product. The wireless connection is sometimes a problem as it doesn't seem to connect to previously known networks. I seem to have to disconnect and then try again to make it connect.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Mine is the 64gb version. It's rapidly becoming a replacement for my laptop (I'm typing on it right now).

There are still things that I have to connect it to the laptop for that should really be able to be done via wifi - iTunes syncing, batch uploading PDFs, syncing photos to and from the iPhoto library. These are not necessarily downsides, just things that are keeping me from using it separately from the computer.

It should really be able to update the podcasts I'm subscribed to automatically via wifi - it shouldn't require reconnecting to iTunes.

The virtually seamless integration it has with the Apple TV is proof to me that it should be capable of doing these things.

The battery life is pretty impressive. The biggest issues I have with its power relate to charging. It comes with a special 10W power adapter which allows you to charge the iPad in a relatively reasonable timeframe, but charging it via the computer's USB port is as easily measured in days as hours.

The charger looks exactly like the ones that come with the iPhone and iPod, and it will charge slowly with those, but the iPad's 10W adapter will overcharge the batteries in the iPad's smaller cousins, seriously diminishing their life. Again, not really a limitation on the iPad, but something for users to be aware of... I've labeled mine ""iPad only"" just to be absolutely sure I don't hurt my other equipment.

The front facing camera is pretty low quality. As a camera intended to be used for video chat, thats ok.
The rear facing camera is pretty low quality.  As a camera intended to be used for actually taking pictures, it's pretty inexcusable.
This is where they lost the star in my rating - I can get around the other deficiencies with iOS apps and by connecting to the computer, and just by being careful, but there's no overcoming a built-in hardware limitation like this."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I already own a 2nd and 4th generation itouch so I was already familiar with how it worked.  My biggest reason for wanting an iPad 2 was I found the screen of the touch too small to surf the web or read a book, I wanted GPS (have to get the 3G model for that), camera (we use FaceTime a lot keeping in touch with family) and 3G for internet access for when we travel and are at places with no wifi.  I spend many hours at various sporting practices each week and for the past two years, the touch has kept me entertained (I actually looked forward to practice since it gave me at least two hours to sit and catch up on everything).

The iPad has taken it to a whole new level.  I have more reading material than I can read (books, magazines, email, etc.).  I love Netflix and HBO GO and I use it to stargaze at night (it can control my telescope through an app).  The entire family likes it so much that It's made the touches obsolete.  My husband who never liked the touch keeps taking my iPad.  The best part for me is that I am no longer chained to the computer.  I can read the news and check my calendar at the kitchen table or the over stuffed chair while having me coffee.  The only thing I've been using the laptop for is syncing.

My complaints are that I can no longer use my computer to charge the iPad (the car charger is also obsolete for the iPad.  I had to but a new one).  I also purchased two extra long USB cables and an extra charging brick as the cords that come with it are too short to charge and sit comfortably on the couch.  I also found that I can no longer use my Altec Lansing speaker dock to play music so that's something else I'll want to replace eventually.

I purchased 1GB of data from Verizon for $20 for the month to see how far it would go.  I've been pleasantly surprised.  I may run out of time to use it before I run out of data.  Granted we have wifi at home and gymnastics but baseball, the grandparents, car and the doctor's office do not.  I thought streaming Netflix and HBO GO would use all of it up but it hasn't."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Not much to say that hasn't been said...Its a bit thinner. A bit lighter..Same SHORT battery life if you have your screen to brightest.  Still no Flash or USB. Camera is Ok,  whatever (It is not an option that I care about) ****BUT It is MUCH FASTER**** with Double the memory!!!  .I use it with a 4G Samsung Wifi Hotspot through Verizon and Ipad 2 is seriously fast!  I use the original Ipad  Apple case as I like it the best even though it fits loosely. I store the cloth and some papers behind the ipad2 to take up the extra room...I was able to sell Ipad 1 in a day.  I'm happy with Ipad 2 especially the faster processor....PS I will NOT buy Ipad 3 unless it has Flash Player...........UPDATE...AFTER FIVE MONTHS THE CAMERA WILL NOT WORK...WILL RETURN IT TO APPLE STORE ASAP...Naturally when returning item I called and asked if they had my model, they assured me they did...I made an appointment...THEY DID NOT HAVE MY MODEL...I was furious...and it showed...one repair specialist Mike kept asking his manager for another....finally they coughed up a brand new model...I realized that when you return you're malfunctioning iPad they'll only give you a refurb....I was incredibly angry and persistent...they finally unwrapped a new box and handed me the brand new iPad (not the box)......I'm surprised at Apples poor customer service....But the brand new iPad works 100% better than the last one....Can't believe I waited months to return it...But they don't make it easy to do	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Although advertised as superior and significantly more updated than the original iPad, the iPad 2 is not all that different than its recent ancestor. A categorical comparison quickly reveals that the quick release and updates were unnecessary in such a short amount of time. For new buyers, by all means get the iPad 2 and the updated features. However, for those owners of an original iPad, do not waste $500 buying this ""new and improved"" product, because the $600 original you are holding in your hands right now is essentially the same.

For starters, the dimensions for both products are the same, with the exception of the width. The iPad 2 is 0.16 inches thinner than the original, resulting in a 0.15-pound decrease in weight. Both devices have the same amount of storage, however the iPad 2 has double the amount of RAM memory performance, which leads to faster download times and less of the ""checkerboard effect.""  Both devices include models with Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi + 3G and Bluetooth capabilities. The displays are the same size and both feature the fingerprint resistant oleophobic coating. The processor on the iPad 2 features the Dual-Core A5 chip, whereas the original only has the A5 chip, but upon consistent use, the speed appears to be about the same. The original iPad uses the Mac iOS 4.2.1 operating system, which is just a step down from the iPad 2's iOS 4.3 operating system, and few differences are noted, and nearly none are experienced.

The one feature that Apple is heavily marketing is the user's ability to FaceTime another iPad 2 user. Although this is cool, is it really worth spending an extra $500 if you already own an iPad? Why not just use your iPhone? Or Skype? Apple is also talking up the iPad 2's 10-hour battery life. They must be hoping no one does their research, because the original iPad has the exact same battery life! The iPad 2 also features a new, smart cover. What's really ""smart"" about an electronic device cover, I'm not entirely sure. I own an original iPad black leather cover and I think it's pretty smart too.

If you are reading this review and do not own an iPad at all, by all means go for the new iPad 2. It's fast, skinny and features a camera and FaceTime abilities. However, if you already are the proud owner of an original iPad, do not waste your money. If it only took Apple one measly year to release an iPad 2, it probably won't take much longer to release an iPad 3 or 4. By that time, maybe the updates will actually be worth burning a hole in your wallet. For now, my suggestion is save your money, cherish your original iPad, and wait until an ""upgraded"" product comes along that actually presents some significant improvements."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"My primary reason to buy an iPad was both work and home use. At work I wanted to stop printing the powerpoint decks and reports to read, and just read them on an iPad in meetings/on the go. For home I was tired of not being able to get to all my magazines and never having them on me when I wanted to read them. I also wanted to watch some TV/movies in bed/around the home so that I did not have to switch on the big living room TV. The iPad 2 has been a perfect solution for all these and more. I'm kicking myself that I went with the lowest 16GB version as I find myself downloading more content and apps everyday! It's not a laptop/desktop replacement either at home or work, but it's a great media consumption device and more.

I already used my iPhone 4 constantly due to the multitude of apps and games available for it. Fewer apps are available for iPad but it's still thousands, and I have already downloaded 200+ to try, most of them free.

The hardware itself is very slick. Very light so you can hold it in one hand, especially if you use a cover - otherwise it tends to be slippery. But it's not so much about the hardware, which other reviews have detailed anyway. It's all about being able to do what you want to do with a device. With the best technology the device itself should disappear and allow you to create, read, connect - whatever it is you want to do. That's what iPad 2 is doing for me, like a netbook never could. Using it is so intuitive and seamless, that despite having the iPhone 4, I am amazed with how much more I can do to be productive. I regret not buying it sooner!

Like the previous devices Apple has created the genius is in the apps available for it. The PressReader apps allows me to read newspapers and magazines from all over the world. I can now read some favorite magazines that were so difficult to get in the print version and newspapers too. Apps like the Flipboard and Zite make magazine content come alive. Favorite magazines like Bloomberg Businessweek and Wired are available free as iPad versions to print subscribers. Also, all news magazines are now featuring interactive content, so I'm reading the news article and looking at static images, and then just as easily click on a video to watch it. The Daily is a good interactive made for newspaper but I'm looking for even better interactive journalism!

""The Civil War"" shows us what history books of future should look like with its interactive content and a daily log of events as they happened 150 years ago. Netflix streams nicely and I can watch the content I want to that bore my family to tears - like documentaries. I also download all my PDF reading materials on it and can read and annotate and highlight. Powerpoints are so easy to read and I can scale the screen to look at the graphs better. iMovie is so simple to use, and I've already created several home movies with music and subtitles. GarageBand is great for novices like me, it has a multitude of instruments that I can play and even has smart versions to create music. With penultimate and UPad I've been trying to completely do away with paper notepads, but that's not the perfect solution yet.

With apps like Dropbox and Box you can drop your files into the cloud and access them from your iPad. Chatting over FaceTime or over Webex is simple, although it's entirely dependent on bandwidth. With other apps you can access your remote desktop and use every program on your computer or pull any file. I am using TeamViewer which is free for individuals to log into my home PC from work and check my files or run some programs remotely. It shows you your PC screen on your iPad and you drag your finger to move the mouse cursor and click. It's pretty seamless once you set it up, as simple as opening the app. I opened it one day from work to see my kid watching Youtube and surprised her at dinner when she told me she had been doing home work (ha!).

Another made for iPad app I use a lot is the Tivo Remote. When I turn it on it automatically shows the program I'm currently watching on the iPad screen with more details and upcoming episodes. I can use the remote buttons or explore like programs, set my season passes, etc. And when I'm not home I can use it to record programs remotely. Xfinity from Comcast also allows you to schedule and watch your onDemand content. HBO GO is simply a delight, I am thrilled to have all the HBO shows available to me anywhere I go!

I have been reading much more since I got iPad 2. Especially blogs, magazines and newspapers. That alone makes it worth it for me. And it's SO much easier to stream content like TED Talks, Lectures from YouTube, movies from Crackle and Netflix. I would have never wanted to sit down with my heavy and hot laptop for such prolonged periods to watch this content. There are some fun games available too, and every day more apps get launched which make me wonder how did I manage without this before!

Facetime has been fun too. There are Qik (from Skype) and Tango, and several other apps available that will let you do video chat but since Facetime is integrated with email, you can just click on a contact's name and choose to connect through FaceTime. I can not only check on my kid on video through this feature (all they need is an iPod Touch and wireless) but also connect with friends overseas for free. And I can click their pics while they're on the call with me. Again this feature is dependent on video quality but as a multi-tasking mom it's been great to be able to connect any time in video from work to home. My kid will be listening to music on her iPod Touch and my FaceTime call comes in - and we're off talking face to face. VLC Player has been a great app to watch .avi and other videos. I had slightly lower res version of a TV series in AVI format and the VLC player allowed me to watch it on iPad, I prefer that screen to my HP Pavilion 17 inch which has worse resolution and tends to get too hot in my lap anyway

Battery life was a big surprise for me. Mine lasts 10-11 hours on the WiFi model with full usage. That is amazing, I never carry the charger as it goes 2 days without charging. Love it! None of my laptops can compare!

The frustrations I experienced with the iPad 2 was its inability to play Flash, which will not come any time soon due to Steve Job's dislike of that technology. However, a genius of an app called iSwifter has found a way to run flash on iPad 2 and I have been using it to watch video on websites that have flash content. However, it's still not as seamless as I would like it to be! The other is a more seamless way to store and organize photos and files. I can do this through apps but why not make this more seamless. If I have to delete photos there should be a select all feature to delete a whole folder.

If you're on the fence about buying an iPad 2 go ahead and make the leap, you won't regret it. If you already have an iPad then hold on for iPad 3 as this version gives you some enhancements (faster, improved graphics, thinner, cameras) but nothing that is so extraordinary that you can't wait another few months!"	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"This is still one of the best tablets out there, slimmer than the first model, great touch response and i love the smart cover; the way that aligns and folds for typing and watching.

The picture and video quality of the cameras is not that good, nothing compared with the iPhone4 or even the iPodtouch4. i really recommend that you test the camera or look at shots done with this one before you buy.

Battery life is pretty good so far is lasting almost all day long with moderate use.

Web experience is limited since don't support flash. The maps app is very accurate.

In my experience the best apps for this tablet are those of magazines, or newspapers, etc. News and books in general look really good."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"I love my new iPad2! But I was very disappointed with the included accessories. The USB cable is frustratingly short. The iPad seems to need more power than my USB ports provide, so it won't charge that way. Therefore I have to plug it into the wall, and the ~3ft cord isn't long enough to have the iPad on my desk or in hand while it's charging. I currently have my iPad sitting on the floor in my office so it can charge. Not a very useful location!

The USB outlet connector is also frustratingly designed. It has so much mass above and below the prongs that, when plugged into a power strip, it covers outlets on both sides of the one it's plugged into. It's nice that the prong set comes off (to make it interchangeable for sale in other countries or for travel, I assume), but a rotating prong would have been helpful. Other products I've bought have had that basic usability.

Overall I gave this review 4 stars. I love the iPad itself, but I can't easily use it the way I want to without purchasing additional accessories, such as a longer USB cable."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"SUMMARY: White iPad 2 64GB Wifi-only
A really wonderful electronic device for media consumption with some moderate content creation potential. This will likely change as more apps focused on content generation are created.  I find myself using it more and more simply because it is ""always ready"" and small enough that it is always near. If this device had a better file management system and a more robust way to share printers it would have gotten 5 out of 5 stars. As it is, the iPad 2 is a solid 4 star device.

DELIGHTERS (Current features that exceeded my expectations)
FORM FACTOR: Thin and comfortable to hold. Small enough to toss in a bag or carry around the house so you find yourself using rather than trying to ""remember"" to do ""that thing"" the next time you're at your computer. Still has some weight to it (1.3lb) so prolonged reading in certain positions will cause fatigue.
APP ENVIRONMENT: Really excellent variety and quality of applications for a broad range of uses and a broad range of prices. Also plays nice with content providers like amazon kindle, Google docs, and lots of news outlets.
SLEEP MODE: It is seemingly ""always ready"" as it wakes from sleep very quickly.
HDMI OUT: Granted there is a $40 accessory required it is nice to have the option of showing what's on your iPad 2 to a larger audience.
iOS: Overall the operating system is ""cleanly"" designed, features are easy to navigate and find.
PROCESSING SPEED: Remarkably quick to load apps, web pages, pdfs, etc.

SATISFIERS (Current features that met my expectation)
HOMESHARING: Being able to share my iTunes library (music, movies, podcast, etc)  across my wifi network is wonderful and saves space on the iPad 2.
SCREEN: Bright, good touch sensitivity, ""flips"" between orientations well, handles pictures and text with aplomb.
PRICE: Reasonable considering the competition but nearly high enough to justify a ""real"" laptop
AUDIO: Speaker is quite good for a handheld device, placement in portrait mode ends up in your lap but you can invert the iPad so not a huge deal. Also speaker faces rear of device instead of forward meaning you need to crank it louder than maybe otherwise necessary if it were forward facing.
BATTERY LIFE: Battery holds up well even after a day of heavy usage, charges up easily over night. Can go 2-3 days without charging with moderate to light usage)
WIFI: This simply ""works"". turn it on, detect a signal, and go. No messing around with complicated network settings.
ONSCREEN KEYBOARD: Its responsive and surprisingly easy to use. However, scrolling to a separate numbers keyboard and lack of a ""tab"" button really disrupts workflow.

DISSATISFIERS (Current features that did not meet my expectations)
FILE MANAGEMENT: File management on the iPad is Byzantine. You use iTunes to ""attach"" files to apps or email them?
PRINTING: Unless you have an AirPrint capable printer (new hardware to buy) or one of a handful other printers you will need to use the atrocious ""file management"" system above to get the docs on you computer to print. Double whammy of pain!
CAMERAS: The two cameras are adequate for video chatting but taking stills is a joke. True I wouldn't want to shoot a lot of birthdays holding an iPad but I would like to use a program like ""GeniusScan"" to photograph documents for later reference. The 0.7Megapixel camera is capable of ""barely legible"" documents.
COST PER GB: Paying >$3 per GB ($100 more for 64GB than 32GB) is nearly twice what you'd pay per GB for the difference in a stand-alone USB thumbdrive.
TOUCH NAVIGATION: Ok so this is a general criticism of any touch device and there is no way to get around it really. Having ""grown up"" using keyboards and mice to interface with computers I am having to learn how to do tasks differently. Press-Hold, Swipe, Two vs Three fingers. All for tasks I was so used to doing with a Tab or Right-click.

WISHLIST (features I'd like to see in the next-gen iPad)
Touchscreen: The capacitive screen works fine for many things but writing notes with a ""fat"" stylus isn't one of them. Having a touch screen that doesn't require the ""fat"" stylus would greatly improve handwriting and note taking.
USB or SD Card ports (never gonna happen as Apple uses memory as a price differentiator but it doesn't hurt to dream)
Retina display
Infrared receiver/transmitter (Can anyone say universal remote!)
GPS
Cheaper 3G antenna: $130 bucks extra for a 3G receiver plus I gotta buy a plan? ugh.
Smartcover: Would like to see this included in the price of the device"	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"Apple fans are loyal (almost to the point of being fanatic) and are a loveable enough lot but one that can get quite upset if one pans an Apple product.

Believe it or not, I've come to praise the iPad 2 but with some modest reservations.

I was an early adopter (standing on line the day it went on sale and patiently waiting for it for almost 5 hours).  Naturally, I was impressed at how quick and easy it was to use.  A lot of thought has gone into the product and it shows.  Instant on (I have the magnetic cover) is a bonus and the screen - large and crystal clear - is not so much a selling point but rather a ""how to"" example for other tablet manufacturers to follow.

The Apple store in the meatpacking district of New York City has a qualified, and very friendly, staff who set the unit up for me while they answered my various questions. Considering that they had been doing this since 5 PM and it was now after 10, that is a lot of dedication for one staff!  The most amazing thing is: they were all quite proud of the iPad 2. It says a lot when the company employees are that loyal.

And the iPad 2 deserves such praise.  The product is, in short, wonderful.  Light weight yet with a solid feel to it, I plan on taking mine to Europe shortly.  After you turn it on, the balance of the iPad 2 is self-explanatory.  From the opening screen of icons, the touch screen makes it almost too-easy to take the product that seriously. But it is a useful tool what with a Calendar, notebook, iPod, photo studio, etc. Naturally the much hearalded APP STORE is there and works fine and at a lightning speed.  Although I wonder about the ""10 hour battery life"" claim - it does manage to work long enough to please the most diligent of users.

Where the iPad falls short is in the area of productivity.  Much discussed, and a sore point, is the lack of a USB port. In todays day and age, that is almost an unforgivable sin. I did get the hook up so I could download my pictures (it works too - and, again, it does it so fast and so effortlessly that it is a minor miracle). There is something almost childish in the decision not to include at least one USB port especially after the loud fracas that happened after the release of the first iPad.  FLASH is another sore point and, frankly, one that I don't understand. There is some conflict going on with the world of APPLE and flash so we don't have it. This makes it very difficult to surf the web. Safari is quick but without flash, it misses one of its major components. Again, and this is just my feeling, this is something that could have been corrected quite easily - starting a year ago with the original.  Now, the iPad 2 (and the original version, I'm sure) can still do quite an amazing amount of work without these two features but as they are considered standard, it is a puzzle as to why the iPad 2 did not have both of them installed.  Also, the lack of a port decreases the iPad's place in the workforce. How can you install, let's say, OFFICE MAC?  The system can print (via Bluetooth) so it could be used as an Office-on-the-run (held landscape, the keyboard is quite easy to do some very fast typing upon - one could produce an awful lot of work on it but . . . without a CD drive to install programs, it makes it difficult).

Other than that, the unit is nothing short of brilliant. Reading books on it is a pleasure (in most cases the iPad 2 is lighter than a paperback so that is saying a lot) and the wide assortment of apps makes it a standard tool that nearly everybody should own."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"So I'm in the kitchen, listening to my music library, and typing a review for the I-Pad 2. I have put a little more than 14 hours of research and 6 hours of non-stop use. I'm not gonna waste my time writing the specs for this device because if you are reading this I assume you already know the specifications, if not you can easily access the Apple website and do your own research. This review is aimed more towards the educated consumer. A consumer, who like me, has spent various hours of the night researching and contemplating his or her next moves.

First, I want to start off with the word ""tablet"", what is a tablet and who needs it? As an avid P.C. user, I tend to define the device as too short, too little. A underpowered, pre-mature device not ready for this day and age. The truth is, their are more people out there who need a tablet versus a laptop. Having a quad core, overclocked, power hungry P.C. I am like most other users; who tend to have a bias when selecting/comparing  portable products. I have been for some time; looking for a laptop with great battery life, portability and power? I first went out and purchased a Macbook pro for about $1199+ some. After a couple weeks of use I was in love. I could not stop showing it off and playing with it. Then I attempted to play games and yes they were playable! But I found myself running to my P.C. whenever I was gonna get serious and then I found myself using my desktop when editing videos. Yet again, I found myself running to my P.C. when it came to doing anything that involved time and effort... It was at this point that I realized that I never used my laptop for more than a hour. Utilizing a mere 20-40% of its power. I used it for; writing papers, showing off pictures and Internet browsing. So I decided to return it. In search for something that made sense.

I never considered a net-book useful or even worthy of my time, even less a tablet. The Motorola Xoom came out and I thought it had potential compared to last years 256MB I-Pad. It offers 1GB of internal memory and 32GB of storage space, all for $599. It not only had the potential, but also the power I craved. Although, its pre-mature operating system was a deterrence. This is the same thing that turned me away from the original IPad. Dispite the fact that I liked the original, if people didn't demand it, the product would die and I would be left with a 500 dollar piece of silicon or waste. I needed something portable and practical. I just felt the tablet was a little more practical, if not more useful too because of its  portability and extended battery life. So I took the plunge and got the Ipad 2.

First impressions didn't fall short; it was easy to set up, had a beautiful screen, and gorgeous aesthetics. While Apple boasts about its 60,000 app's, I'll tell you what, it's not enough (way better than android though). While you can download IPhone and ITouch apps; they are simply not the same (a 3.5inch app on a 9inch screen). Face Time also seems to be problem, since it cost money for all your friends who don't have an IPad 2 or new Macbook. Tango or Skype are excellent alternatives, but still only supported in a 3.5 inch window. Despite this, it has some killer apps (e.g gmail, calendar syncing, web browsing and etc). My favorite app is TeamViewer, which gives you remote access to your PC from anywhere. This app is simply amazing. I was able to install some programs to my PC from school! While It doesn't support flash, it plays almost every video stream I've seen from the web. Hey, that's all I needed anyways. So I can't complain, but all you flash gamers might.

Now I found this whole ""touch-typing"" thing to be an exasperation. Since I am primarily using this product for note taking, its important I am as accurate as possible. Keys kept skipping and words kept missing. So I upgraded to the Apple-wireless-keyboard.. sigh. It was a well spent 69.00 dollars (cheaper models are available). I am able to control volume, brightness and music. Also makes my tablet feel more like a high end net-book. I want to talk a little bit more about writing. I bought this tablet with the intention of using google docs. Well it works, but you have use the mobile version, which has limited functionality. I tried switching to desktop editing, but it was horrendously slow and unworkable. As a matter of fact I'm writing this with google docs now. As long as you are not using bullet points or etc; you should be fine. I do notice some errors that result from a slow ping, so it's worth trying noting it happens. I could more easily recommend using apple's built in ""note-taker"". Its responsive, practical and free.

As far as ""Air-Play"" goes, simply amazing. Kind of a pain to set up though. One really has to go into every setting in I-Tunes and mark share libraries under preferences and account profile. When the set up is complete, you simply log in with your I-pad and use the same mobile user name and you are good to go. Of course you have to keep your computer running the whole time unless you have a dedicated server of some sort. Air-paly grants you access to your music, videos and HD collection. which makes that whole HDMI out thing really convenient. Granted its only 720p, Ive never noticed a huge difference between 720 and 1080p Additionally stream times are relatively quick. Just keep in mind this depends a whole lot on your network. Which bring me to my next issue of storage. I honestly feel the only thing anyone needs on tablet is, pictures and apps. Unless you are going on a long trip; a couple movies. I am content and don't think I would ever need an I-Pad with more storage. As far as 3G goes, will its just that. A three year old bandwidth solution. If you can get a tethering plan instead, I would highly recommend it, as you can also transplant GPS automatically when tethering.

All in all I'm really content I took the I-Pad 2 plunge. A dive, I really never saw myself taking or considering. Having an android phone and P.C.; it would seem like honeycomb would have made more sense; considering the attractive specs and all. None the less, the IPad 2 meets my draconian standards for 2011. Making any other device look over weight and under-spec'd. While the consensus of professional reviewers have voted the camera insufficient, I could honestly say it does what I need it to do, which is provide fun and entertainment. The rear HD camera is similar to the one installed on the new macbook pro models (2011 refresh). Other than that, I don't plan on taking high quality photos with the device. I might do future reviews with the camera though. check out my youtube channel for video reviews, just look up oceansidecreations."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	"The first iPad really defined the tablet market and while a trickle of competing tablets were released, none of them has matched the critical acclaim of the iPad 2. The consensus of CNET, Engadget and most other tech reviewers is that the Motorola Xoom is the closest competitor, but falls just short of iPad.

This latest version of iPad sports a thinner design, front and back camera for casual filming and FaceTime/Skype video calls, a gyroscope, better speaker and, of course, a dual-core processor and 9x faster graphics capabilities. You still get the 10 hour battery life, but it's all wrapped up in a nicer package. That said, it doesn't seem drastically different than the original iPad and it feels like this version is simply an iPad with cameras, and the cameras don't perform especially well.

Granted, the increased graphics capabilities do make a noticeable difference in the handful of games that take advantage of the increased speed (""Infinity Blade"", ""Real Racing 2 HD""), but most of the apps I use most frequently - e.g. CNN for iPad, Netflix, ABC Player, iTunes Video, iBooks, Pandora, SiriusXM, Apple Remote - don't feel like the user experience changed much beyond the increased volume coming from the speaker.

My big disappointments with the iPad 2 are that the cameras aren't great, though that's forgivable since I'd use them mostly for video calling anyway, and that the screen didn't increase in resolution from the first generation iPad! I want my Retina display!

However, overlooking the faults of the iPad 2, it's still the best tablet on the market, in my opinion.

My kids love the educational apps (""Monkey Preschool Lunchbox"", ""First Words Animals"", ""Shape Puzzle HD"", ""Talking Larry"", ""Peekaboo Barn"" and ""Garage Band"" are all highly recommended), and I think they've gone a long way in teaching even my mildly autistic daughter memorization and puzzle solving skills!

I also love that I can get paid content from apps lie Netflix, (Comcast) Xfinity TV and Hulu+ and even free content like on-demand ""Bachelor"" episodes and other shows from the free ""ABC Player"" app. There's just so much capability available to the device through apps and certainly, the wealth of apps available in the App Store is one of the iPad's biggest strengths vs. competitors!

It's also a great device for checking email and casually surfing the web, as long as the site you view doesn't require Flash, which is still unsupported. I used to have a netbook that took 5 minutes to boot, then had an awkwardly small browser window and slow response, but you see nothing but instant-on capability and smooth navigation with iPad. I'd definitely prefer this tablet to a netbook!

Also, a couple of other miscellaneous tips for those interested:

1. The new magnetic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Smart-Cover/dp/B004QKM3AA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Smart Cover</a>&nbsp;from Apple is a must-try! The automatic wake and sleep on opening/closing the cover is more handy than you might first think, as is the ability to roll the cover into a stand for the iPad! We watched Netflix from bed while my wife nursed our baby recently, and it would have been a pain without the handy stand!
2. If you buy an&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/AirPort-Express/dp/B0002GDIII/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">AirPort Express</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Apple-TV/dp/B001FA1NK0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Apple TV</a>, you can wirelessly stream music (and video in the case of the Apple TV) to a remote set of speakers using AirPlay or the Apple Remote app! It's cool to be able to listen to my iTunes content from my kitchen with the iPad as remote control!
3. If you're debating whether to buy the WiFi-only or the WiFi/3G iPad, it's worth noting that by paying for the WiFi hotspot capabilities on an iPhone 4, you can not only get data, but location services for your iPad 2, so you can save a couple hundred dollars on hardware and future-proof your connection speed since you can buy a new phone instead of a new iPad to take advantage of increased network speed.

In summary, I highly recommend the iPad 2 if you're in the market for a tablet. Its apps are highly entertaining, portable and easy/quick to launch a play, and it just may change the way you surf the web and check email! Even your kids will love it!

The few innovations this model sports aren't what they could have been, but are nonetheless compelling."	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	Hope all these people get stuck with them. Hope everyone can wait until the store can catch up on stock.	4	electronics
B0013FRNKG	We bought this for a lady who stays with us and needed it. It came in okay condition and had worked great for about a year or so now I just wish we would have waited for the price I think we could have found a newer ipad in better condition!	4	electronics
