{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00UGBMRQ8", "review": "Have been using the 3.1GHz Intel Core i7 version of this new MacBook Pro with 16GB of memory and the 500GB flash storage, a significant upgrade from my previous early 2011 MacBook Pro. There have been quite a few changes, of course, in the four years between these units. Some of what I've noticed so far:\n\n1) The keyboard has a slightly shorter throw for each key. As a result, there is a short period of getting used to the new keyboard, especially for the touch-typist. You'll find that you occasionally misstep, having a little difficulty double-hitting a character (such as for the word \"hitting\"). Spacing between keys has not changed. Ultimately the overall feel here is perfectly acceptable.\n\n2) The sound quality has improved enormously. Listening to music is wonderful as both the amplitude and frequency response have improved. Stereo separation has also improved many-fold. Watching movies using the built-in audio is now enjoyable enough that I no longer feel like using headphones to improve the experience.\n\n3) The retina screen makes more of a difference with text than I expected. I figured I'd see a difference only with photos - with those the change is quite significant - but even the text in the menubar is more legible than it was. Being able to increase the apparent resolution by scaling makes a big difference when I'm working with two documents at once. Your mileage may vary depending upon how farsighted you are, however, and at just over 50, I feel secure that I'd have liked this even more ten years ago!\n\n4) Overall speed has improved dramatically for basics such as webpage loading, opening applications, restarts, and other common activities, particularly with feature-glutted applications like MS Office.\n\n5) I missed the Ethernet port at first, but the Apple USB Ethernet Adapter works well on the MacBook. I definitely miss the CD-ROM drive as I used to use my MacBook to burn music CDs to use in the car. My government contractors still insist on providing documentation on disc, so for the time being I'm forced into schlepping an external CD drive with me much of the time. I fear it will be a few years at least until everyone is comfortable NOT using CDs to provide information.\n\n6) The new trackpad was immediately intuitive. If you were comfortable with the older trackpads, this new interface will be comfortable from the start.\n\nOut of the box, no problems, and migration from my old Mac took about an hour with a Thunderbolt-to-Thunderbolt cable."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00UGBMRQ8", "review": "UPDATE APRIL 2017\n\nOver two years later, this Retina MBP is still going strong.  No problems of any kind.\n\nI'm writing with a quick update to compare this to the new 13\" Macbook Pro with Touch Bar released in November 2016.  I use one of these at work and feel I can offer a good comparison.\n\nThe new Touch Bar MBP's best feature in my opinion is the form factor:  it's 1/2 pound lighter, a bit slimmer, and has a smaller footprint than even the 13\" Macbook Air.  Yet it packs a full-sized keyboard and gorgeous 13\" display.\n\nThat's pretty much where the advantages end, in my opinion.  Despite a newer processor, it's no faster than my 2015 MBP.  The Touch Bar is a really cool idea but in day to day use it doesn't add much value to my experience.  Sometimes it makes you do more taps and presses to get to the thing you want, which is slightly annoying.  But I can totally live with the Touch Bar and have faith that it'll get better with newer software.\n\nThe keyboard in my opinion is awful.  It's the same keyboard they put on that new 12\" super-skinny but underpowered Macbook.  My error rate is much higher on the Touch Bar MBP with its flat keyboard.\n\nFor some reason, the new Touch Bar MBP is less comfortable to hold.  The lines are somehow sharper.\n\nI thought the switch to USB-C ports only would be super inconvenient.  It isn't, at least not for me.  Yes, I need dongles and adapters, but all of my USB devices work just fine with the new computer, and the dongles are really not that inconvenient.\n\nMy particular unit has an annoying defect:  there are some shorts in a few of the keyboard switches that randomly trigger certain Touch Bar actions.  That's a warranty issue and not likely to be a problem for you, but it further reduces my affection for the machine.\n\nBottom line, the 2015 MBP is still my favorite Macbook, and the one I'd buy again if mine were lost or stolen.  I\n\nIf you like the small form factor of the 2016 Touch Bar Macbook Pro, I'd suggest waiting until the fall or winter when the next iteration comes out with a faster processor and hopefully some of the other issues addressed.  Though it will still have a crappy keyboard.\n\nHere's my original review of the early 2015 Macbook Pro:\n\n--\n\nI use my early 2015 13\" Retina MBP pretty intensively every day.  I'm evaluating it relative to my 11\" recent-year fully loaded MB Air and the most recent non-retina MB Pro, which I used for a year at work.\n\nHere are my impressions of the 2015 rMBP so far, relative to these other Macbooks:\n\n* Display\n\nThis is the main reason I bought the rMBP and I'm absolutely thrilled with it.  It blows away every other Macbook's display except of course the 15\" retina MB Pro.  (The 15\" Pro is too big and heavy for my needs, and is overdue for a refresh.)  For years, I've been running my MB Airs with an external monitor, a pretty decent 25\" 1080p IPS display, and I was happy with this setup.  No more!  The external monitor and obviously the MB Air's display are a major step down from the rMBP's display.  I'm spoiled - it would be really hard for me to go back now that I'm used to the MBP's gorgeous high-res display.\n\n* Weight\n\nThe 13\" rMBP weighs 3.5 pounds.  Whether that feels like a burden or a breeze will depend on what you're comparing it to.\n\nI'm coming from a 2.4 pound 11\" Macbook Air, which I brought with me almost everywhere, including to work every day.  The extra pound of the 13\" Pro is very noticeable.  The weight of the pro was the only reason I hesitated choosing it over a 2015 MB Air.\n\nIf you're comparing the Pro to the 13\" MB Air, the Pro is only 1/2 pound heavier.  If you're comparing the Pro to similarly configured Windows laptops, many of which weigh 3 to 4 pounds, it's in the same ballpark in terms of size and weight.  If you're comparing the Pro to the 13\" non-Retina Macbook Pro (yes they still sell these), the non-Retina Pro weighs a full pound more than the 13\" rMBP.\n\nFor me, the Pro's extra weight relative to the MB Air is a compromise I'm willing to make in order to have a much more powerful machine with a much better display.  Plus, I no longer need to bring my laptop with me everywhere now; sometimes it's fine to just bring my iPad mini 2 and external keyboard.  (It helps that MS Office is available on iPad now, and IMHO it's pretty good.)\n\n* Force track pad\n\nThe \"force\" part -- pressing the track pad harder to activate different features -- is not supported in most applications now, but more and more applications will support it in the coming year.  Until that happens, it works great as a regular trackpad - better than the (already excellent) trackpad on previous MB Pros and Airs.  I like using the new trackpad pretty well.  But it's not a killer feature, and in the future when more apps take advantage of it it will probably be like having a third mouse button--handy, but hardly essential.\n\n* Speed & Performance\n\nThe 2015 rMBP has a newer generation of processor and graphics.  Everything feels very fast, including bootup times, app startup, running apps, ripping music CDs, etc.  That said, the 2014 model feels very fast, too, and I don't think most people will notice any speed improvements with the 2015 model over the 2014 model in normal everyday usage.\n\nApple claims the 2015 model's flash SSD is twice as fast as the SSD in the 2014 model.  Independent testing from professional review sites have verified this.  However, in normal usage, I don't notice much difference - the SSD in last year's model is pretty dang fast.\n\n* Battery life\n\nApple claims 10 hours to a charge, compared with 9 hours on last year's model.  Independent tests by professional reviewers largely support Apple's claim:  Laptopmag.com reports 12 hours 4 minutes; PCMag.com gets 11 hours 10 minutes; CNET gets a whopping 15 hours 42 minutes.\n\nThese figures are stellar, but the testing conditions are not realistic.  In real-world usage, there are so many things that affect battery life.\n\nDuring my first 10 days with this machine, I never got more than 8 hours and usually more like 7.  After much research & diagnostics, including a visit to the Genius Bar, I tried what all of you reading this must think is the obvious thing to try:  I turned down the screen brightness.  It turns out that you get a couple extra hours of battery life on 50% brightness compared to 80% brightness.  I can now get close to 10 hours, maybe a bit more.  I *prefer* having the screen brightness at 80%, and often leave it there while running on battery as long as I know I won't be away from an outlet for more than 6 hours.  But for those rare times when I do need maximum battery life, I know I can get it by dialing back screen brightness to 40-50%.\n\n* Summary:  should you buy one?\n\nBuy a retina MB Pro instead of an Air if you want a MUCH better display, more connectivity, a more powerful system, and don't mind an extra 1/2 pound relative to the 13\" MB Air (or full pound relative to the 11\" Air).\n\nIf you choose the 13\" retina MBP, I'd encourage you to shop around for good deals on last year's model.  It has the same excellent screen, keyboard, design, and same exact weight and dimensions.  The 2014 model doesn't have the new force trackpad, but I think most people can easily live without this.  The new 2015 model is slightly faster, but I think most people won't notice the differences in every day usage--I wouldn't.  If you can save $300 by getting last year's model, that seems like a no-brainer to me.  I didn't do it because I'm a teacher, and with my education discount at the Apple online store I got a 2015 model for about the same price as the best deal I could find on last year's model."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00UGBMRQ8", "review": "I bought this MacBook Pro 2015 straight from Apple's site and have to say it's really fast and runs super cool compared to other MacBooks. Data transfer's insanely fast and programs install in seconds. On the outside case there's nothing different compared to the 2014 MacBook Pro's but these do come with faster SSDs and the new Intel 5th Generation CPUs which are probably the reason it runs so much cooler I'm guessing.  They also have the new haptic feedback trackpads which are snazzy to say the least....I have not explored the full capabilities of it yet.\n\nI'm giving this one 4 stars because I bought this MacBook for audio production / Ableton but straight out of the box the latency is more than double what it is on my old MacBook Pro 2011 which is a major problem if your producing without an external audio device on the go.\n\n2015 MacBook Pro 512 Samples - 30 MS Delay\n2011 MacBook Pro 512 Samples  - 14.4 MS Delay\n\nIf you don't care about audio latency then you can disregard this concern.

Combined with the fact that it was free 2 day shipping & the lowest price I could find for the computer I wanted I decided to go with amazon & this company even though there were a few negative reviwes about them. I was surprised at how perfect the computer was. One tiny scratch, works perfectly as far as i can tell & its been over a month. The only thing is that the anti reflective coating on the screen is starting to rub off in certain places & doesnt look very good in high light. I looked it up & apparently this is a flaw Apple knows about & isn't advertising this but they will fix it for free if you bring it in. I think they were giving people 5 years.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00UGBMRQ8", "review": "Despite being a Windows user for many years, I have to say the transition over to Apple was by far the best decision. The MacBook Pro 13 inch offers a beautiful Retina display that's wildly clear and vivid. This laptop is incredibly lightweight and slim (ultimately won me over after years of lugging around a whopping 5lb Levono). Some say the new force touch track-pad is inconvenient because of the \"lightness of the click\", where most users want the satisfaction of a physical click beneath their fingers. Personally, I love the convenience of lightly tapping vs downright clicking.\n\nAmazon made finding a MacBook Pro within my budget easy! I settled on the 2015 version because it had all the specs I needed for home and work use. And after trying out the 2017 MacBook Pro in-store, I am happy with my decision. I HATE the new keyboard the newer version comes with. It's essentially flat. I understand trying to it slim it down but the user-error is so much higher! Not to mention, the TouchBar is just another gimmicky addition to the \"future of Apple\" (really not as effective as one would think). The 2015 version has the old keyboard with keys that you can actually type on without the fear of a typo every other word. The battery life (so far) is fairly true to the description and has lasted me 8 hours of constant use. I was skeptical to purchase a used laptop, especially one so pricey, but after some research of the better sellers, this laptop has exceeded my expectations."}

Dings and wear are expected for a used computer, BUT if no one even took the time to wipe the outside and clean the screen, how can someone trust that the actual device was refurbished???\nIt did not go through a normal start up. I had to look up keys to press to get into a start up mode to even set up the computer.\nCustomer service did not respond for almost a week, and I ended up paying +$20 in shipping to return the device.\nThe only good experience was getting the money refunded for the actual laptop."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00UGBMRQ8", "review": "I am a student at Iowa State University studying supply chain management. I got this computer over three years ago before starting my collegiate career. This review will discuss my good and bad experiences with this computer. I will start with the positives then the negatives, and ending with my recommendations for someone looking to buy this computer.\n Starting with the good, I've had almost no problems with the capabilities of this computer. It runs all the programs I need for school with ease such as JMP, Connect, and  Learnsmart. Also I occasionally play the game League of Legends which needs a substantial amount of processing power. The computer runs games with no problem except they tend to drain the battery quickly. Other than that I have had little problems with battery life. I usually have 4-5 apps open, several tabs open in safari, and stream music. While doing this the battery still lasts several hours even after 3 years of ownership. This computer also has more than enough storage space to last you several years. The 15 inch screen is great for watching movies and videos. The speakers on the computer produce good quality sound and are loud enough to fill a small room. Lastly the multi touch and side by side features are great for navigating through multiple windows and working on things that require two apps to be used.\n Now I will discuss the negatives of this computer. Although, the size enhances the viewing experience I have had more problems with it than anything. First of all it is heavy and is a pain lugging to class daily. It is cumbersome to use in class, it doesn't fit on most desks, and takes up a lot of table space. A couple years ago the laptop fell off my futon while it was open resulting in a broken screen. In total the damages cost me over $1,000.00, because the employee at the apple store strongly urged me to basically have the entire computer refurbished claiming there was \"water residue\" on the motherboard. After that I have been particularly careful with the computer, but I have noticed 2 of the screws on the bottom have fallen out since I had it repaired.\n Overall this computer preforms great, but the size is a nuance. If you are a person who plays a lot of games or someone who works with video software like Final Cut Pro I recommend this computer for you. If you are looking for a computer for business, school, or just to meet your basic computer needs I urge you to opt for the 13 inch computer."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00UGBMRQ8", "review": "I LOVED my 2011 MacBook Air. I LOVED my 2014 MacBook Pro. I was wildly excited to upgrade to the larger display and more powerful processors at the end of last year, finally having some extra money. It was a HUGE MISTAKE. The only significant change to the MacBook Pro line over that time was the implementation of the Touch Bar, which is a gimmick. Gimmicks I can deal with if everything else works, but it appears to have caused more harm than good. It is unresponsive, it makes it harder to work with function keys, it lacks the ESC key, which comes in handy far more often than you'd think. In addition to that, I've had more crashes, more hangups, more delays and more freezes than any previous model and when it is running, I can't tell a bit of difference in speed compared to the 2014 model I had used for years. I can understand a few bugs, but we're a year into the lifetime of the device now and I'm still waiting on fixes. It doesn't play well with 3rd party software (LastPass, Boxcryptor, LibreOffice, Microsoft Office) and it doesn't even run the basic software that well anymore (Preview and iTunes are both more finicky than previous iterations).\n\nAs of this afternoon I dropped almost $3000 on the new Surface Book because I've lost faith in Apple's ability to make a superior product. They've apparently gone all-in on fancy tablets and phones and forgot that some people actually do work on computers every now and then. It smacks of a company that hit a trillion in market share and got fat and lazy because of it. It's probably not \"goodbye forever\", but it certainly feels like \"goodbye for the next three or four product cycles\"."}

My 2012 MacBook Pro 15\" had all of those features, and a DVD-burner, but its display was not as good as this, and it was larger and heavier.  This generation of the MacBook Pro is superior to the 2016-2017 MacBook Pro with TouchBar, because this has at least 2 usable USB 3 ports (as opposed to ZERO usable USB 3 ports), and it has the excellent MagSafe2 power connector.  Too bad this computer is no longer available.\n\nApple is taking way too many things out of their products: 1) headphone jacks from iPhones, 2) wired Ethernet from all their laptops, 3) MagSafe power connectors from their laptops, 4) common USB 3 ports, and the list goes on.

I mean I am supposed to be flying the next day with this system and I am dealing with all this, since i needed the mac so i went to apple authorised service center who tell me they will charge 129$ for unlocking it, I thought lets try reseller , drove down to a reseller who told me without original buy reciept they can't unlock this and even then it will take them hours. That was my final straw , went to UPS to drop this idiotic box because Amazon is great at shipping but lousy at picking a useless system. Overall please avoid if you can."}

It's new enough to be a hefty speed/processing upgrade from my previous now-deceased laptop (a very solid HP bought in 2009!) and a few other Apple options I was eyeing and communicates well with my iPad, but old enough to communicate with my 2010 iMac, install some of my older Mac software without much trouble, and include the older standard USB ports.  It's pretty amazing to have a computer that boots up within 30 seconds and to poke around Sierra without worrying my older desktop would implode at the upgrade.  I was a bit leery about the HD only being 256GB, but then again I'm efficient with space and don't really need more.\n\nI did try out the 2016 MBP models at Best Buy and did find them impressive, but personally didn't like how shallow those keys were, that I would need to purchase a USB hub, and the fact that the touchbar wouldn't benefit me.  Plus, I was lucky enough to find a used but practically-new listing for the 2015 for a fabulous price (THANK YOU) and that sealed the deal."}

Everything from the power cord to the computer looks brand new. In fact, the only way you know it's probably not new is because it didn't arrive in an Apple original box; it arrived wrapped (neat and tight) in bubble wrap in an amazon box. With the recent Apple upgrade to macbook pros (the touch of genius bar or whatever), the price has jumped. I can't justify paying that kind of money for some ridiculous upgrade. Happy I got a great machine for half the cost!\n\nThis is an upgrade from my mid 2011 Macbook Pro. I'm a graphic designer/gamer and my creative software operates with no problems and I'm able to play The Sims 4 and World of Warcraft on very high settings with no problems at all. Overall, I'm very pleased. When purchasing used items from Amazon, make sure to check the REVIEWS/RATINGS of the sellers. I'm seeing a lot of reviews saying they received the wrong item.

I use the two-finger click=right click feature, and lately it sometimes treats a two-finger click as a one-finger click, and navigates to the page instead of giving me the pop-up window so I can \"open as new tab.\" A couple times it has brought up a right-click window when I didn't \"right click.\" Other than this, I have no problems with this computer.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00UGBMRQ8", "review": "Like many people here, I looked at both this model and the newer 2016 Mac Pro 13.3\".  I tried both out in the Apple store---several times---and came to the conclusion that this 2015 model had more features that I wanted than the newer model.  Besides being $200 less than the new model, I liked that it allowed me to use my devices that use USB2 and USB3 ports---the new one doesn't unless you buy adapters.  it also has a bigger battery which on online tests show it gives roughly two hours more than the substantially smaller battery in the newer model.  Apple insists they both provide 10 hours (12 for iTunes on the 2015). This means I'll get more use per charge than if I got the smaller battery in the 2016 model.  The keyboard on this one is superior to the clackety one with little tactile feel on the 2016 model.  I've been a typist for 55 years and though I can type well on both keyboards, I prefer the softer, quieter and apparently more reliable scissor-type on the 2015 model.  Online issues seem to turn me off the new \"butterfly\" keyboard.  I also like the Touchpad on the 2015 model.  The oversized one on the 2016 seems to catch people's wrist movements and cause errors. The newer model is brighter, but I never go about 45% on my display so it would be lost on me.  One feature I do like about the new one is that it turns on when you open the lid...saves wear and tear on the Power On button.  The weight difference is less than half a pound so that was not an issue for me.  For me, the 128GB storage is more than sufficient.  On my iMac with 1TB, I still have only used 30GB with my iTunes, documents, apps, and security camera operations, so  I know 128GB will not get used in the years I have this.  The final positive of this 2015 model is the MagSafe plug...a blessing and to cut costs, Apple did away with that and the USB, HDMI ports on the smaller 2016 model.  As someone else said, this is likely the last fully compatible Mac Book as it seems Apple is paring down features and I wouldn't be surprised if the headphone jack will go next.\n\nUpdate:  6/12/17:  Working perfectly.  Been getting approximately 11-12 hours per charge.  I don't do gaming but I surf and use iTunes and some security camera features.  Never gets warm either so I am thankful for that.  My military retailer matched another local retailer's price so got this for a bit over $1000.  Great laptop."}

I ventured back to the MacBook Pro world and purchased this model after much research.\n\nI was an avid PC user. I absolutely loved having my Acer aspire one netbook and a large desktop before they started to run VERY slow. I tried everything to resuscitate them, but alas, I decided it was time for an upgrade. Because I love the genetic software Macvector (keyword=mac), I decided to try out a macbook.\n\nOne of the first things I noticed after firing up this device was how quiet and effortlessly it performs all tasks that I ask of it.\nResponse is excellent.  NOTE:  I did opt with the 8GB RAM 128 GB HDD to save money.  But after using it for a few weeks now.\nI would definitely should have upgraded to the higher end of these options.\n\nPros\n------\n\n- Battery life appears to be excellent\n- Laptop is light (Granted I am used to the Dell Latitude Brick that I have to haul around for work)\n- Love the trackpad (Much more versatile and effective than its PC counterpart and really cuts down on the need for a mouse)\n- Performance and processing speed are bar none\n- Generous Selection of ports (This is in reference to the newer model)\n- Laptop is sleek and dare I say, sexy\n- No need for as many dongles (Needed for the newer model)\n- Price Point is much better than the newer model\n- Still has fully set of function keys (Unlike the newer model)\n- Apple Genius Bar (Invaluable)\n\nCons\n-------\n- No internal CD/DVD (So no burning unless you purchase an external drive)\n- Retina Display is nice but not mind blowing as other have suggested\n- Does not have the Touch Bar that you can get with the newer model (But in all honesty .. seems more gimmicky than actually useful)\n- Not as slim or light as the newer model\n\nOn a personal note, I did a lot of research on this model as well as its newer competitor.\nIMO, this model was faster than the newer model.  While the newer one is sleeker and feather light, this model is no slouch and I barely notice it on my backpack. I enjoy the processing speed of this model .. It seemed slightly faster in my testing than the newer model.  The newer features being offered did not seem to legitimize the price for the latest model.\n\nAll-in-all, I have been extremely satisfied so far with this purchase and am enjoying my not-so-cutting edge purchase."}

I won't go into that-- but I decided Apple was worth a try because they build the hardware AND the software!\n\nThis laptop has a SSD (solid state drive).  If you think you're not a techie, that's fine...but this one thing is important.  These hard-drives are lightning fast, and they have no moving parts.  The entire computer is faster and more responsive because of this, and it'll last longer too!  I've always cared alot about RAM and CPU power, but a slow hard-drive creates a bottleneck that makes those things kinda useless.  Anyway, SSD drive is SPECIAL...if you don't buy this immediately, I have a few more sentences I guess:\n\nThe display is excellent.  The computer is thinner than you expect.  I've never had a single problem with it (almost 2 years).  It's easy to clean, it looks good, and its battery life is unmatched in the whole industry.  The battery life is another reason I decided Apple was worth a try!  The SOUND of these speakers is also better than any other laptop I've ever owned.  Please know I really love this laptop, and I can't recommend it highly enough.  I think the reason I never reviewed it....is because I've never looked back.  It's just perfect."}

This unit will run completely down in less than 36 hours when it's simply in the state of SLEEP. The answer from Apple it's the software on the computer.  Well it does this WITH the software that came with the bloody computer.  I have been in contact with Apple over 8 times since October, have taken the unit to Apple Store for repair/fix/replace what ever, but they insist that there is nothing wrong with this computer.  Well I have tried to explain to Apple that this is a man made object and not EVERY unit will come from the plant working as designed.  Even in November, less than 30 days after purchase they told me that it was a software issue.  I have been in the Information Technology long before there was something called Apple that wasn't a fruit. Lesson here is IF you purchase and Apple product from Amazon make sure that you put it through its paces within the first 28 days of the purchase of the unit, so if it's not working up to your expectations you can return it to Amazon.  The local Apple store wouldn't except the unit after the 31st day. Finally this is not my first Apple or Apple Product.  I have purchased over the years over 5 MAC computers, 5 iPads, and the iWatch all of which are working just fine unit the expired after many years of hard work."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00UGBMRQ8", "review": "It's 2017, right? Times are a-changin', right? No one needs those silly outdated things like USB-A ports, HDMI, and SD Card slots built into their laptops anymore with USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 Protocols being established in the tech industry, right?\n\nNO APPLE! JUST, NO!! WRONG WRONG WRONG. ESPECIALLY FOR A PRODUCT YOU LABEL \"PRO\"!!\n\nBeing a PRO product in the laptop industry indicates that it is built in the interest of people such as myself who want to render video files, transfer photo albums, and more using their SD cards, hard drives both new and old, and so forth. Nixing the USB-A ports is something I can KIND OF forgive Apple for, given that USB-C is going to replace everything it is able to replace here given a half a decade, but the SD CARD SLOT! THE SD CARD SLOT!!!!!! WHAT HAVE YOU DONE APPLE!!! WHY???? OH MY GAWD WHY!!!!!\n\nPardon my toddler temper tantrum, but I just had to release that pint up anger I have been distilling in the deepest catacombs of my patience for months and months.\n\nThis review is going to be long and is intended to be as much a praise filled review for the 2015 MacBook Pro I purchased recently as it is an admonishment of the 2016 MacBook Pro.\n\nI am a nursing student and an up-and-coming YouTube reviewer and I decided it was time to buy something I could take to school with me every single day and do video editing work on that would be streamlined with my other Apple products. I live on the go. I eat fast food products (probably more than a nursing student should), sleep very little, do homework and study from the open of some coffee shops until they close, and write reviews and work on videos way more than I probably should given that I am supposed to be learning how to save peoples' lives and stuff.\n\nThus, I set out with a $1300 dollar flexible budget to find the right Apple computer for me since I am already up to my eyeballs with joy over my 2017 Alienware 17 R4 PC back home and wanted to go in the direction of my other Apple products (call me a sheep for Apple if you want, but I think this review will prove that I am willing to call Apple on their bull and if you don't like Apple products than you should just go away, you are DEFINITELY reading the wrong review, bub ;).\n\nAfter doing lots of research, the 2016 MacBook Pro 13\" base model seemed like a great choice for me. It sports a long 10-hour battery (so they say), is---patience of a 18th century Catholic school teacher---thin, and has all the latest and greatest Apple goodies built-in save for the touch bar (an entertaining addition at best, downright annoying at worst---many reviewers say). Alas, there were too many compromises made for Apple to make such unapparent dimensional and functional abilities manifest.\n\nThe biggest for me that is not negotiable is that they executed the SD card slot!!!\n\nAt least with the USB, HDMI, and MiniDisplay ports, we can huddle in a corner with our precious dongles and whisper into the empty night, \"My... precioussssss...\" and assure ourselves that someday we will be able to transition all of those items into actual USB-C replacement products.  But Apple-- stinking, rotting, and losing its nutritional value Apple---decided that it was time to say, \"Off with their heads!\" like The Red Queen (and with as much sanity) to all of the poor, begging-for-mercy SD card slots in the MacBook Pro lineup; forcing usuntil death or sale or accident do we part---- to have to use an external adapter of some sort to read our SD cards. That. Was. So. Stupid. Of. Them.\n\nI feel completely confident in making up the statistic that 99.9% of all professional and semi-pro photographers use SD cards in their cameras or other equipment. The SD card is in no way obsolete, nor has current wireless technology replaced the intrinsic value of physical storage and transfer methods being hardwired into devices. I do not CARE that there are SD card readers that are USB-C compatible. When I am on the go doing film work or working on reviews, I do not want to have to worry about carting around 50 dongles!! Some smart reader might be thinking right now, \"Well wait Bren, you said you have the 2017 Alienware 17 R4 and it doesn't have an SD card slot, why aren't you sad about that?\". Because that PC is a 10 pound desktop replacement gaming laptop and it can gladly stay at home as it can afford to utilize a SD card reader as I already have 500 cables and adapters running from it in its usual dusty waiting spot (nursing student, remember? Its been a while since I have gamed :'( ). This summer when I use the Alienware laptop more, I might get occasionally annoyed that it does not have an SD card slot, but then I will more than likely remember that I have a Mac and switch to working on it anyways (oooooohhh, he said it Mac haters... 0.0). Even for the comparably Mac sized 2017 Razer Blade 14, I am disappointed but somewhat willing to forgive it of its lack of SD card slot as its primary purpose will be gaming for most buyers.\n\nBut the MacBook Pro is a different story. It is a small, light, powerful device that until 2016 seemed custom fit for content creators, photographers, and other such lines of work or hobbies.\n\nImagine this scenario because something like it WILL happen someday if you get the newest MacBook Pro: You are on a multi-day vacation or out for an all-day photoshoot having the time of your life. You sit down at some point to get some albums created and pics and videos uploaded from your camera when, \"Oh NO!! SHOOT!!!. You have lost, forgotten, or had stolen your precious SD card reader! Now you are out of luck and that's all she wrote. Comment and tell me your solutions to this SD card reader dongleitis (not a real medical diagnosis, I am quoting MobileTechReviews' Lisa, there), but I will reply to every solution with, \"But wouldn't it be better if it was just built in?\".\n\nThe vacation/school/work trip scenario applies to any other dongles you might, no will--have to use until your hand is forced by the market to replace every legacy port item in your arsenal.\n\nI saved $300.00 and bought this 2015 MacBook Pro Retina 13\" on sale and I absolutely love it. Any gain in weight and thickness between this and its younger sibling are pretty much negligible to me. When you are on your next flight and your carry on is a half-pound over or slightly too thick, you are not going to say to yourself, \"Aw shucks, I should have gone with the 2016 MacBook Pro!! What was I thinking?!\". You are going to say, \"Well, I guess grandma's Christmas jammies she knitted me last year could have gone in my checked suitcase on this leg of the trip!\"\n\n10 hours versus 9 on the 2015. An hour gain in battery life: For who? Doing what? When? Where? I get it, I really do. I spent 4 months trying to find a gaming laptop that could give me just 30 minutes more battery life in a coffee shop typing if I needed it and boost the battery life from 2 to 2-12 hours. But 9 hours versus 10? I really hope to our Lord in Heaven Above that you are never stuck glued to a chair in a wall outlet-less dessert of a room for that long. Or that you can't manage to turn south your upturned nose and just dim the light down or postpone that video transfer for an hour or if absolutely necessary.\n\nBetter yet, the solution to the battery life drama resides in the hands of a company originating on Indiegogo called Omnicharge.&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Omnicharge-Omni-20-A-Portable-Power-Bank-Charger-for-Laptops-Cameras-Phones-Smart-devices-and-More-AC-HVDC-Power-Outlet-Fast-Charging-USB-Ports-70W-Adjustable-DC-Output-20-400mAh/dp/B01NBJX99D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Omnicharge | Omni 20 | A Portable Power Bank Charger for Laptops, Cameras, Phones, Smart devices and More | AC/HVDC Power Outlet | Fast-Charging USB Ports | 70W Adjustable DC Output | 20,400mAh</a>&nbsp;I included pictures that show my beautiful 2015 MacBook Pro and the Omnicharge Omni 20 I just got recently. The Omni 20 is a portable power bank and the first of its kind that can charge this MacBook via the Mac charger hooked into the Omni 20s AC wall outlet port and with direct DC Output via a custom made Magsafe 2 cable the company sends you when you choose it during order as shown in one of the pictures!! I am not sponsored or compensated in any way for saying this, I was an early backer of the Omnicharge on Indiegogo and it has more than exceeded my expectations when I finally got it last week. It won tech of the year at CES 2017 and I will not be surprised when it appears on every major retail website including Best Buy, Newegg, and others, it is already available for purchase in the U.S on Amazon. It is expensive, but it is absolutely, positively worth it. If you buy this Macbook Pro on sale like I did, you can take the $300.00 you saved and buy an Omnicharge to get essentially 14 hours of battery life with your Mac!, buzz off 2016 MacBook Pro!!  Check out my full-length review of it in the comments, I know you are going to want to consider it yourself as soon as you skip around in the table of contents I made for the video and see everything it can do, just note that at the time I filmed this I still had my 2015 MacBook Air. New Videos will be coming featuring my lovely MacBook pro!! I am going to link the Amazon page for it, I am not sure where it'll pop up in the review, so I hope it doesn't seem scammy! :D\n\nOverall, the point of all this drama is just to say that any stated gains in whatever whatevers the 2016 MacBook Pro 13\" base model is trying to shove off on you just are not worth the sacrifices involved nor the snooty price premium you will pay for the latest-yet-not-greatest from Apple.\n\nThis entire review was written at 3am in the dark on my lovely, perfect, streamlined, truly and honestly PRO MacBook product. The 2015 MacBook Pro Retina 13\" base model from Apple.\n\nIf you have made it this far in the review, then that means that this device has that much interest to you. Or I am just that good of a writer. Just buy it already for crying out loud!!!!!\n\nIf this review made you laugh or helped you in any other way, please hit like so others can see it!

My previous MacPro was the old 2011 beast.  It still runs and I still like that computer but I'm very, very happy with 13 inch and I haven't missed the screen space-- at all.\n\nI chose this older model because frankly I thought the new Macs were a step back with less rather than more.\n\nLooking at the laptops side-by-side it might be hard to imagine working with two pages up on the smaller screen.  But I had no problems adapting.  Other advantages include the Retina display and lack of weight.  Honestly that made more difference than anything.  It's so much easier to carry.\n\nHighly recommend."}

Be forewarned however - I am on power cord #3 in 5 years, complete with electrical tape to cover the exposed wiring.  While yes, the charger does look great coming out of the box, plan on buying another shortly thereafter - and after, as long as your patience holds up.  Do not waste your time calling Apple to see if there is anything they can do about it after 1 year (unless of course you want to pay even more money on 'Apple Care').  As the hours in your day wind down, they will tell you to go here and there, call you back, ultimately to find out that, \"I'm sorry but we do not cover that\".  As much as I love the computer, and tout MacBook to all my friends, for me, it stops here and now.  Why can't they produce a simple, reliable power cord? I do the same things with the power cord as I do with a company provided Surface 3 power cord, but this  cord frays after a year and a half while the Microsoft product looks good as new.  Apple should ashamed to be associated with this cheap, lousy, clearly inferior, plastic nightmare - but then again, maybe that is exactly what they do want, so profits soar.  Buyer beware!"}

Two primary areas that concerned me the most and what will prompt me to return.\n\nPlease note that I upgraded to the latest build of Sierra and I strongly believe this is what is causing it.  After a few days of use, the Battery life, not just reporting in activity monitor, but actual real world usage is not even better than my $700 dell (7559).  This thing can now only last less than 6 hours.\n\nI'm not running Chrome, indexing is not occurring (I hate this BS excuse for Apple apologists), I'm at half brightness, just web browsing and nothing major is occurring in activity monitor to induce this.  This is unacceptable for a laptop that is $2K after taxes. A laptop that prides itself on exceptional battery in the 10 hour range on super light usage.\n\nLastly, the screen.  Yes, its been improved in 2016, but the overall quality is sooo underwhelming.  Looks dull and has poor viewing angles.\n\nAdvice.  Don't upgrade to Sierra and don't accept paying close to 2K for a product that is 2 years old in the apple line, with a mix of 3 and 4 year old hardware."}

The keys feel fantastic to type on.  The overall design is sleek and pleasing to look at and hold.  The force touch trackpad works great.

You can actually take a picture of this screen and not have near the amount of wavy lines that you used to get.\n\nThis thing is fast and efficient.  I've only had it for about 2 months now, but I don't think I'll ever go back to slow-as-mud windows.  I really like the fact that when it boots up, it's up.  There's no waiting to boot, log in, then wait for it to finish booting like a windows machine.  This thing boots up, you log in and you're ready to go!\n\nI do wish the screen were bigger, but I had to go with the 13\" due to budget constraints, so that's on me.

I LOVE this macbook's battery life and control; it is much more energy efficient than my windows PC is. If I were to have any qualms it would be the size.

The retina screen is beautiful on this MBP and it still has all the ports I need. Came with a new install of MacOS Sierra and is extremely stable. I purchased this as refurbished from the Amazon Marketplace and saved over $1000 off the retail price. Honestly, it looks brand new and untouched. It also came with 2 years of Apple Care included which is why I went with it.\n\nI upgraded to this early 2016 (pre-touch bar) model from a 2012 MBP because of FCP X.  The internal SSD is much faster (1100MB/s write & 1700MB/s read) with Black Magic Disk Speed Test.  Also moving from the old Nvidia 650M graphics to the AMD M370X has provided at least a 50% improvement in rendering and video playback in Final Cut.  FCPX (afaik) does not use CUDA processing but takes advantage of the OpenCL of the AMD chipset.\n\nFor those that also need Windows10, this machine runs it extremely well.  Bootcamp is a quick, automated process and a non-activated Win10 image is free from MS for download, which makes this MBP a 2-in-1 system for uses of both operating systems."}

One of my tech genius friends gave it a thorough look-over and said everything was fine despite the screen, but I might have issues with it later. A day later, I turned the computer on and the screen began flickering. I had to return. I'm pretty upset. I spent extra money for expedited shipping. I have both Amazon credit cards, and I'm a loyal customer. Now, the item is completely out of stock and who knows when it will be back. I'm scared that I will be charged the 15% restock fee or that when it comes back the price will be higher. I know mistakes happen, but this really blows.

I tried out Mass Effect 1 which runs okay but it's slow like the Xbox 360 at 1980 X 800 in medium settings. Fast forward now on Windows bootcamp even on idle after a few minutes the fan kicks in for no reason. I don't really like MacOS but I prefer it over Windows 8 that's the reason why I went with apple last year but now I prefer Windows 10. I say get a gaming laptop instead of this unless you just do video editing and watching Netflix. I paid $2,000 last year it's not worth it but at least it has its ports.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00UGBMRQ8", "review": "I needed a new Mac. I was waiting on the mini but Apple seems to have abandoned both the Pro and Mini.  So I waited for the October 27th MacBook event to see what the new MacBooks would offer.  I was sorely disappointed. The performance improvements were marginal at best and some of the other \"improvements\" were just plain mind boggling. The touch strip is a gadget that O can see quickly fading into a fad more than usefulness.  In an age of touch screens, why downgrade to merely a strip?  The USB-C ports are a terrible idea. I don't want to hear about \"future-proof\".  I have peripherals that I need to work with my MacBook right now.  They include a USB mouse, a Thunderbolt dock, an HDMI monitor, two USB 3 external hard drives, several USB 3 thumb drives, two Thunderbolt external drives, several SD cards from my cameras, an iPhone, an iPad and an iPod. I don't want to be forced to buy adapters to make all that work.\n\nSo, I stuck with the older retina MacBook but then had issues with quality control. I had to return two before I finally got one without issues right out the box. The first made clicking sounds during use.  Normally, that wouldn't bother me but in an all flash notebook, that's not a normal sound.  The second had severe light bleed around the edges and corners as well as a really bad mura spot.  Look Apple, if you're gonna charge us absurd prices for your hardware, at least make sure the QC is better. I literally feel like I'm paying for the Apple name at this point and nothing more.  Anyway, MacOS Sierra seems nice and stable so far. The 13\" rMBP works with everything I have right out the box. I can charge and sync my Apple devices, access my external drives, access my digital camera photos, connect to my 27\" external monitor and use an external mouse all without the need for a new dongle.  Processing power is more than sufficient because of the low overhead of MacOS. Remember, MacOS is made to work with the latest MacBooks which have 1.1-1.2 GHz CPUs.  That makes the 2.7GHz of the rMBP pretty zippy. It's not as thin and light as the newer MacBooks but it's not exactly what I would call thick and heavy.  It compares favorably in size and weight to my wife's Air.  Battery life isn't spectacular like it is with the Air but still better than my Windows laptop.  The display quality is okay but \"retina\" shows its age when compared to some other high-res screens like my Asus Zenbook.\n\nI got my retina MacBook on sale for $400 less than the cheapest (non-touch bar) new Mac and $700 less than the cheapest touch bar enabled new Mac.  This will also likely be my last MacBook because the prices are beginning to get absurd, especially for what you get. I've been a Mac user for nearly a decade. This is my fourth Mac. If Apple keeps up this habit of radically increasing the prices while marginally increasing performance or, even worse, crippling their Macs (USB-C ports only), it definitely will be."}

I listen to OVO radio a lot, and can jam to this laptop all day. Battery lasts about 8 hours with my workload which is fine by me. Upon startup, it takes a few seconds to get to the login screen due to the ssd inside. Screen looks fantastic! Images look vibrant and clear when I watch videos and work on pictures with adobe. It worth the money for years of solid performance. Illuminated keyboard is nice and bright at night and the mouse pad took a day for me to get used to since I used a lot of windows laptops. I have it connected with my apple tv and do airplay which is a nice plus. If you have an apple watch, another cool feature is that you can login into your mac without inputting the password.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00UGBMRQ8", "review": "Bought this immediately after seeing the unveiling of the late 2016 model.  Losing the function keys for a toucher was a deal breaker.  I use those for too often to have them be virtualized, moving around or even unavailable.  The new one, while touted to be up to x faster, the numbers are based on the slowest 2015 and fastest 2016.  The base model went up in price $400, which excludes any performance benefits.  As a matter of fact, video is actually slower than this model, without the upgrade.  The only real upgrade for the new one, before adding on options is faster memory.\n\nI run windows and linux VMs fairly regularly and while I could run them on a comparable Windows system, adding windows systems to an already portly windows system has never worked out well for me, so while disappointed in the new upgrades, this 2015 model still rocks VMs and does all I need it too for far less $$$.  While USB-C is cool, a bag full of dongles is not.  I prefer ports, especially the SD slot, which I do use regularly.  With real function keys, I don't worry about one vendor or another not upgrading fast enough and losing virtual function keys, so this model is golden.  Hope Apple puts back the function keys and keeps the touch strip too.  I could see it being useful for some things, but not a replacement for real function keys.\n\nAnyway, if you are contemplating buying one of these and they are still available, do it.  They are great machines, even if the crowd loves to follow the blinky light!"}

It's too bright at the lowest setting and shines through the spaces around the keys.\n- The lip around the top side (around screen bezel) that softens closure is easy to leave impressions on, even with your nail.\n- There's an uncomfortable looseness to components inside when you shimmy the laptop side to side. It might be intentional.\n- There's an unsettling bend on the left-hand rest that progresses into a crunch if you rest your elbow there. So far no issues.\n- And, on a personal note; I'd prefer the clicks and Jedi touches be more sensitive. This is skin against glass/aluminum, in case someone forgot. Phones are touch and slide, think about it. Yes, I've changed my settings.\n\nOtherwise, a fantastic piece. Performant, reliable, lightweight and well proportioned."}

Here are my impressions:\n\nThe good:\n- Retina display is so good you'll wonder how you ever used anything else\n- Remarkably thin and light for all the power it packs\n- Can drive three external monitors at once (two Thunderbolt/Mini DisplayPort+1 HDMI)\n- Glowing fruit logo on lid assuages status anxiety\n\nThe bad:\n- Retina display is so good you won't want to use anything else\n- Battery life is mediocre for workI get 4-5 hours using Chrome, Slack, and Spotify\n- Having only two USB ports is disappointing for a machine with \"Pro\" in its nameexpect to invest in a USB hub or connect peripherals through a monitor\n- Disposable designthere's no way to upgrade the RAM and Apple has done all it can to block hard drive upgrades, which means faster obsolescence\n\nDespite my objections to Apple's crass monopolistic practices, I can't deny that this is the best computer I've ever used, and its combination of display quality, fit and finish, and software integration remains the gold standard for a large laptop in 2016."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00UGBMRQ8", "review": "This product is ideal for students and people who are involved in creative fields such as architecture, design etc.  As a student I can tell from my perspective that this is a great computer. I have also used windows computer but after two or three months they tend to become slow. Switching from windows to Mac book is one of the best decisions I have made. I will be describing the following characteristics that make this product brilliant:\n1. Display- Apple upgraded the quality of its screen from the previous model and I have to say that it looks breathtakingly stunning. This screen is far more superior to that of all the computers out there in the market right now.  The new retina display screen provides less strain to the eyes. Everything on the screen is crystal clear and movies are a joy to watch. Although this computer has many other amazing features but this is one of the major reasons, one should go for this product.\n\n2. Speed and performance- Very fast processor, you would not have any trouble loading the web pages or any other form of document. It is designed in a way that will decrease power consumption while maintaining high performance. The new generation of processors is one of the key components that make the computer faster and stronger. The sound quality is really great, does not matter what genre you are listening to.\n\n3. Battery- It has strong battery life with up to 10 hours of usage. It usually depends upon how much an individual uses the computer. If used continuously, it can last for about five to six hours. I cannot say on behalf of everyone but for me, the battery life is just fine.\n\n4. Weight- This is an extremely light computer; you could easily carry it wherever you want. It is certainly lighter than most of the computers out there. Weight is one of the characteristics that will make you like this computer even more.\n\n5. Appearance- Apple as usual has the best appearance when it comes to computers. Especially with the apple symbol present, your computer will look more attractive than others out there. This is also one of the characteristics that sets Macbook apart from its competitors. The track pad is comfortable to use and better than most of the computers in the market.\n\nAt the end I would like to say that this is a great product, although a bit expensive but it will be worth the amount you pay."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00UGBMRQ8", "review": "Overview\nThe MacBook Pro is a useful product that is very helpful in academic and work environments. Students will find that the operating system will run efficiently and productively. The computer is built to last, but remains lightweight and easy to transport. The start-up is very quick and content loads quickly, making it ideal for student use. You will find the MacBook Pro is convenient to use, and has many small features that add vast accessibility. If you own any other Apple products, the MacBook Pro can connect with them and using cloud-based storage, can communicate across devices.\nThe various short-cuts and tricks that the MacBook Pro has can be difficult to remember and use correctly, and the software is much different than that of a PC. However, once you are able to better navigate your way around a MacBook Pro, the short-cuts and tricks that this laptop has makes for a very efficient device. The operating system also varies, and though there can be some compatibility issues, a majority of software downloads include an option to download for Macs as compared to Windows. If you are looking to use a laptop for student use, this would likely be a great fit. Microsoft Office Suite can be used on a MacBook Pro, and though the layout is different, the functions remain the same and its unlikely you would need to use any other computer for any other software needs.\n\nDurability\nMacBook Pros are also well known for their lack of computer viruses, and as a student who requires a computer that runs smoothly, that is an incredibly important quality. To a student working on a paper late at night, the last they you would need is an error message or not being able to save your work. This is a rare occurrence on the MacBook Pro, which is very comforting. Its software is very durable, and the hardware reflects that as well. The MacBook Pro is sturdy and difficult to break. Unlike some other Apple Products, its very unlikely to have a crack in the screen or run into any physical problem. For those who commute with your laptops frequently, this physical durability is an important asset.\n\nPrice\nThe price of a MacBook Pro initially seems steep, but it is a very efficient, lasting computer. As a student, there is no negative aspect to the computer aside from the expense. You will likely pay no service fees and will have the computer for years to come. Ultimately, the MacBook Pro seems to be well worth the price tag."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00UGBMRQ8", "review": "Users\nThe MacBook Pro 2015 with retina display is an ideal product for many users. This MacBook excels in many areas making it a great general purpose laptop. Paragon users will heavily interact with different CPU intensive applications. This include word processors, video editing software, digital audio workstations, and others, which the 2015 MacBook Pro handles suitably.\n\nEvaluation\nI will evaluate the MacBook Pro on the criteria of its Hardware, Software, and Design. Specifically, how the hardware handles execution of applications, how responsive the software is, and how elegant the design is.\n\nHardware\nWhen it comes to usability the MacBook really shines. Even multitasking the MacBook pro glides through execution and responds instantly to every click. Hiccups are rare occurrences, which are easily remedied by reopening or refreshing the application.  The battery is extremely long lasting. Even when multitasking you can expect six to eight hours of battery life.\n\nDesign\nThis MacBook Pro provides a stunning display and sleek design. The 4k screen is by far the most impressive feature. Switching between crisp clean screens makes the user experience much more enjoyable. The screen is embedded in a sleek sliver matte body with curved edges giving it a clean modern look. Using a machine that looks great makes you enjoy using it again and again. In addition to looking great it weighs three point five pounds making it very portable.\n\nSoftware\nOS X is specifically built for Apples computers so you're in good hands. OS X runs your applications in a lightweight manner making switching through them a breeze. Responses in applications are immediate and OS X makes interfacing smart and simplistic. Apple is always updating OS X making it more efficient so you will always have the best.\n\nCons\nThe price tag of thirteen hundred dollars is the biggest contention point. It may seem expensive, until exploring the marketplace for another quality laptop. A great user experience, elegant software, stunning design, and powerful hardware is seldom found elsewhere for a less or equal price.\n\nEvaluation\nEvaluating the MacBook Pro on the criteria of its Hardware, Software, and Design it excels in every category. Ive enjoyed my MacBook for a year now and its yet to disappoint. The mix of power and elegance that the MacBook Pro provides through its hardware and design makes using it seamless and enjoyable. Apple has had a long history of creating great products and the 2015 MacBook Pro is no exception to the tradition."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00UGBMRQ8", "review": "I just recently bought the MacBook Pro 13 inch and really like it.  Im a 21-year-old college student that uses it almost every day for about 6 months now.\n\nThe products ideal user is someone that has a lot going on and who needs a computer for multiple different purposes.  For example, if you're working on a homework assignment in the internet browser, writing a paper, on email, Facebook, all while having Netflix and Skype open at the same time, this is for you.  If you're using it to play computer games or do any intense image rendering I wouldnt suggest it just because there are other computers more powerful designed for that.  This is very easy to use and looks nice.  Its also really light which makes it easy to carry around somewhere like a college campus.  I was looking for a computer that was able to multi task with multiple desktops open at once, easy to use, compatible with programs like message, and looked good.\n\nWhat this product is really good at is multitasking with different desktops open and not crashing or freezing.  Im able to have many desktop screens open working on completely different projects without it freezing.  The user interface is also the best in the industry and very clean and easy to use.  It looks nice and the life of the product before it becomes outdated is a lot longer than competing PCs.\n\nThe only downside to this is the price.  At about $1,200 it is a lot more than a PC but the use and benefits from it is well worth the price to me.  The only problem I have had with it is the USB port not working.  All it took to fix that was a quick trip to the Apple store for them to reset it and they were working again.  The customer service from Apple is amazing and will help fix any problems you may run into.  To wrap this up I think this is a great product if you do a lot of multitasking and like easy to use computers that are also able to do a lot.  Its also great because itll hold its value and the performance of it doesnt decline as fast as most PCs."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00UGBMRQ8", "review": "My MacBook Pro is the 2013 model. It is a 15 Retina with 256 GB of storage. I use it just about every day for either schoolwork or leisure. The products ideal user is someone who is going to use it everyday for one thing or another and most likely uses it intensively. Its not worth spending the money if you don't use it that frequently. The reason I gave it a 5 star rating is because I don't see many flaws. To rate something 4 stars I believe there should be a few apparent flaws that prevent it from being a 5 star.\n\nDurability\n\nThe laptop itself is extremely durable. From incidentally falling off the bed to throwing a backpack with the computer in it, the laptop has stood the test. After three years, there have been no signs of wear and tear except for a few minor scratches that could have been prevented with a case. That being said, don't go throwing the computer on purpose because you think you can. It is still a computer, which is fragile and not indestructible.\n\nDisplay\n\nThe Retina display is great for someone who is going to use the computer for storing and editing pictures or even streaming movies. It gives the computer an overall better picture. The 15 option makes it easier to have multiple documents up at once and be able to easily see them. This makes it easy for the typical college student researching for a paper to have the Internet up on one side and the document on the other.\n\nVirus Resistance\n\nOverall Apple products are good when it comes to not getting viruses. For as much as I use the laptop for surfing the web and streaming movies it has not gotten a virus during the three years it has been used. I had an HP laptop for about the same time period and it became so bogged down with viruses that it was almost unusable. Dont expect complete virus control with this Mac laptop but it should do a great job.\n\nOverall\n\nThis laptop has done what has been asked of it and I applaud Apple for doing such a good job creating this product. Reiterating the fact above that this laptop is most likely not for the casual Facebook user once a week, it is designed for the user who is going to get the most out of it and use it to its full potential. If you really want a high quality laptop I suggest spending the money for this one though. Hopefully this review was of use to you in your decision to purchase or to not purchase this product."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00UGBMRQ8", "review": "Are you looking for a new computer for school? Well then this is the computer for you! I recently stepped up to this computer from my 2013 Macbook Pro, and have been pleasantly surprised with how much better this computer is than the last. The new computer is sleek, fast, and easy to use. If you do photography, then no problem! This computer is fast and has enough memory for all your photos and photography programs. The most important features on this computer that I enjoy are ease of use, memory, and performance. This computer has everything a student or photographer may need.\n\n-Ease of Use\nThe new Macbook Pro with retina display is much easier to use than the later models. While it is quite a bit more expensive, its easier to work through projects and programs. The keys of the keyboard are easier to type on making papers much faster to work on. One flaw in the thin design of this computer is the lack of CD burner. For most people this probably wouldnt be much of a problem but if you like to burn music to CDs or photos to DVDs this can be an inconvenience. Thankfully they have an external CD burner available for purchase.\n\n-Memory\nWhile the memory you pay for depends on the model you get, the 512 GB flash storage is plenty for the average student. You won't need to be out purchasing expensive flash drives or hard drives to make up for the small storage of your computer. I currently use my 512 GB memory to store almost forty thousand pictures along with all of my schoolwork, and it still runs the same as when I first brought it home.\n\n-Performance\nAlong with a larger memory this computer has a 2.9 GHz processer which is so fast you won't have to be waiting around for your computer anymore, your computer will be waiting for you. The faster processer will allow you to run computer programs faster with no slow waiting time. You won't have to wait for videos to buffer for schoolwork or Netflix anymore!\n\nMy experience with this computer has been great! Ive been using this computer for a couple of months with very few complaints. If you are seriously considering this computer I would say you have come to the right place."}

I find my desktop to get cluttered easily, so I have to learn to work with Finder to manage my files. There are some things that I don't even use on this MacBook Pro like a dashboard. What is that? And having another desktop? MacBook pro can be more complicated then what was advertised. I thought MacBook was supposed to make things easier. It doesn't. In fact, it gets more complicated. For instance, you need to transfer photos on CDs to your client. You need to buy an external drive, download another app, and then you got to deal with Photos Library, which is a mess in its own. The keyboard is really getting used to, but thank God that I can use my PS2 adapter to use my very old Windows' keyboard to use the \"DELETE\" key, \"HOME\", \"END\", etc... However, after adapting my Logitech Mouse and my old Micro Innovations keyboard to the Mac, I'm liking this laptop. Why is this a 4 stars instead of a 1? It's because I can use all the programs I used on my Windows laptop on this MacBook. Now you may ask, why did I buy a Mac in the first place? My beautiful wife. Before I got married, I'm a Windows user and she's a Mac user. After 2 years married, I'm being converted.\n\nRecommendable:\nYes, but it will take time for a Windows user."}

Compared to the 2011 8GB/320GB MacBook Pro it replaced, everything is way faster, of course, but also, I've adjusted the screen to display 1440x900 pixels, so I can see a lot more content than before. Other small differences that make a difference to me are the speakers, which are much louder, and even though I'm running the same apps as before, which I was able to import from the older MacBook using a thunderbolt cable, when I look at memory use in Activity Monitor, Memory Pressure is always green, whereas before it would go into yellow after a day or two, and I'd have to restart apps to get it back to green. Lastly, I'm learning to make good use of the forceclick haptic trackpad -- for example, I've learned that if you click with 2 fingers instead of tapping with 2 fingers, the context menu comes up instantly :)\n\nI may as well mention that I just ordered a Samsung T3 500GB portable SSD from Amazon, which I'll be reviewing soon, and that's how I'm compensating for the 128GB internal disk. For listening to music, I connect an iPod, and with iTunes set to not automatically sync devices, I can select the iPod and play tunes from there. So 128GB storage can be stretched far with a little ingenuity."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00UGBMRQ8", "review": "Some people would like to believe Macbooks are overpriced. They're not. Windows laptops with similar specs come with a similar price tag. Performance on any ultrabook between $1000-$1500 is more or less the same. What makes the Macbook Pro stand out then? In the past, its premium construction served as a major selling point. Today, that's not the case. The build is still excellent, that hasn't changed. However, companies like Dell, HP, and even Microsoft have responded by constructing laptops with equally excellent builds. Apple's Macbooks still hold the crown for best trackpad. Windows-based laptops have made great strides in improving their trackpads but when your starting point is the base of Mt. Everest and your goal is, well, the top of Mt. Everest, the improvement doesn't mean much. If your primary interest lies in web surfing, you'll find the Macbook's superior trackpad to offer a far better experience. The last major area the Macbook stands out in is its operating system. How does it compare to Windows? You'll find the two are similar. Most of the things you were able to do in Windows you can do in OS X. Most of the things. Let's talk about the operating system.\n\nOS X is far prettier than Windows. That might seem unimportant but this is what you see every time you open the lid. Simple things like the gaussian blur OS X applies to many of its program makes the experience feel more modern. An area that has consistently plagued Windows is its settings menu. Control panel is a mess. OS X's system preferences is a god send for anyone who's ever struggled with control panel's messy interface. Then there's the little quirks each operating system has. To keep this review from getting out of hand, I'll highlight the most annoying omissions from OS X.\n\n1) There is no volume manager natively built-in. Don't ask me why Apple decided their users don't need the ability to control each application's volume. There is a solution. Volume Mixer. It costs $9. Yes, you need to spend $9 to incorporate a feature that's been a part of Windows for as long as I can remember. On the plus side, Volume Mixer is aesthetically better looking and more functional that Windows' volume manager but $9 is ridiculous.\n\n2) Hitting the red X on an application minimizes the window. This one is the most puzzling quirk. You wouldn't expect Apple to have such a blaring redundancy in their software. The red X and yellow underscore do the same thing: Minimize the window you have open. Why do you need 2 buttons that do the same thing? And right next to each other, no less. RedQuits is a 3rd party application, like Volume Mixer, that fixes this. It's free too.\n\n3) When you rename a file, Finder relocates you to the new location of that file. In Windows, if you click on the file next to the one you're renaming (or behind it), you can retain your place in the folder. This is useful when you're in a folder with a lot of files. Almost every 3rd party renaming tool is garbage and doesn't work how you would want it too. The only solution I found lies in a program called Renamer (or you can search Renamer 5). It's $20 base. Way too expensive for such a simple function but there's truly no alternative. They'll drop the price down to $15 after your trial.\n\nEvery issue I discovered has a solution. A couple of them cost money. But when you're spending this kind of money on a computer, what's $24 extra? Other minor differences vary among manufacturers. A couple of spec differences you'll find Apple consistently stands on top with is in battery and audio quality. Take the Dell XPS 13. It's battery can last a healthy 300 cycles before degradation. The Macbook Pro's battery lasts 1000 cycles before degradation. Audio quality is superb on the Mac. Better than on any computer I've heard prior (this is my first Mac)."}

I have spent nearly $5000 on two MacBook Pro in the last two years because after 20 years, Windows 8 gave me the rest, I was determined to never go back to Windows. Well, both Apple MacBook Pro notebooks  failed me within months. First one was bought in January 2014 in the US, within ten months the monitor was covered with vertical colored lines. I contacted online service in October that year, they told me to return it in the US. Well, I work in different foreign countries so I could not have it repaired since I did not return to the US in time. Fortunately, it was stolen not long after and the insurance paid for it. Since then I thought I had been unlucky this once, so I bought another MacBook Pro at Amazon in August 2015, albeit with less memory, for \"only\" $2400. Well, within 9 months, it turns itself off, doesn't start with the on/off button and the keyboard does not work anymore, so I'm using a Bluetooth external keyboard. As off today, it doesn't even work with that anymore, shuts itself down within minutes. Warranty? Ha! Forget it! I won't be in the US until it conveniently runs out. Apple? NEVER again. I hope a Linux  notebook will become more user friendly or I'll revert to Windows."}

That's how disappointed that I am.\n\nMy husband bought this as an anniversary gift for me. I was thrilled. The Macbook was delivered late, last Monday, the 25th of July. By Tuesday, I was experiencing problems with the laptop disconnecting from the wifi. The reconnect to wifi would not work so, to reconnect, I had to restart the laptop. Now, my son and my husband both have computers and neither lost their connectivity.\n\nThe next day was no better and by Thursday the connection would drop within minutes of log in and restarts. Thursday, I called Technical Support at Apple. The analyst was exceptional in her attempt to help resolve. We tried for three consecutive days, including  re-installing the software and Saturday evening, she walked me through a new install of the OS.  The next time I logged in, went through the whole set up process again, and opened a browser, I disconnected within minutes, requiring a restart. The turn on wifi button still did not work.\n\nThis is my third Macbook. The first had to be returned within a month. Both Apple and BestBuy were stumped. The second Macbook was okay, it was actually more high end than the first, but eventually I had trouble with it holding a charge. A few hundred dollars later, three 'repairs' for the same problem and none worked, I just could not spend any more money on it, packed it away and bought a $300 laptop. Then my husband bought my third Macbook. (You'd think I would have learned)\n\nNeedless to say, I'm returning it and won't by another. But I am so very disappointed"}

But I needed reliability, and I got this Macbook and has lasted me quite well. Not much too worry about, I use an external hard drive to make sure it runs adequately and the memory does not get too full. The display is clear and looks great. I tend to have a lot of tabs open and have netflix on the side and it is able to handle it quite well. I love this mac as I can rely on it to work when i need it too. Holds a great charge though it is time for me to service battery which I actually think is problem since the battery cycle count is not too high. I like the size it's not too big and heavy so its portable and doesn't fill my bag with too much weight. I don't know much about computers so can't tell you exact processing and computing reviews but what I can tell is that is is a good computer albeit expensive because I know you can get something for way less that works easily the same or even better but may require some more maintenance. Next I'm looking to get an imac for my office or get  monitor to attach. I personally love the trackpad I prefer it to using a mouse, which I do have the apple mouse but the trackpad is my favorite, I'm thinking of getting a trackpad for my office set up since the mouse gives my wrist pain. I use a case and it is fairly well protected, it has gotten a mac shadow on the screen I think someone stepped on it but it's past the apple care warranty but not too bad and I can deal. Can overheat if I use it on my bed so bought a lapdesk to prevent the blockage of air flow. Overall I like this computer and would buy it again."}

It is also smaller, lighter, less USB, and no CD drive anymore. and it doesn't even seem faster. The track pad is changed too: lighter but no way to do right click on it anymore?

I can say this is last time I buy a mac.  BTW I bought it elsewhere for the same price match here."}

Her experience with the Asus was so-so, we only got it because we got it for $300 but it only lasted 1.5 years. Since the Asus got quite slow making it effectively counter-productive to use, we decided to get another laptop. And there was pretty much no choice other than to go with Macbook given her earlier experience. We got a great deal for this item, it was cheaper than a similar refurbished item at Apple website and a newer model as well."}

I've been forced to deal with Windows garbage for several years and I finally decided to invest the extra money in a Mac. If you keep this computer for a minimum of 4-5 years it is well worth the extra cost. You save time (things run incredibly smooth) and money (no need for antivirus programs) and FRUSTRATION. Windows is so choppy and annoying. Constant prompts to upgrade to the new Windows 10 (I've used Windows 10 and it still sucks), progressively gets slower, and the maintenance is a mess. No more need to defragment, run anti-virus software, make sure my firewall is on, clean the registry, run disk cleanup, etc etc.\n\nIf you want something that just simply works then this will be worth the extra money every time. I'm not an Apple fanboy. I think most of their commercials are corny along with those sad souls who wait for hours in line for the new phone/tablet  that will be obsolete in 6 months.

I'd purchased the square trade warranty option for 3 years. Low and behold my laptop stopped charging and eventually died shortly AFTER the warranty I purchased had expired. After about a month of waiting while my MacBook was in the shop was being troubleshooted, I was informed that the cost of fixing it would be nearly as much as would  be to buy another one. So, that's exactly what I did. Originally so impressed with the MacBooks functionality,  in January 2016, I bought another  new one. Imagine my surprise when the exact same issue happened, within just 7 months of ownership. Sadly, figuring that since my last MacBook worked for over 3 years before failing me, this one would do the same. So, I didn't bother purchasing the warranty this time. Big mistake! I paid over $2k for this thing and it's now worthless.  If you're not a computer technician able to repair these types of products, do not buy it!"}

I wanted a solid state drive and a change from the constant updates, virus worries, and problems in general with Windows so decided to spend more for a MAC.  For me, adapting to the differences between Windows and Apple has been frustrating and time-consuming.  On the plus side,  nothing beats the state-side customer support and the SSD.  There is no noise and best of all no heat.  It is very fast and I can open multiple windows without any lag.  I'm on and off this laptop daily and the battery lasts for hours and hours.  I thought I wanted a 17\" screen but the 15.4\" is more than adequate and the backlit keyboard is a must-have. On the minus side it has no internal cd/dvd drive, telephone port or ethernet port so I cannot fax or use my CDs until I buy these adaptors. Not having an internal CD/DVD drive is Apple's argument that it's lighter but  it's not as light as I think it should be.  I'd rather have the internal drive.  I'm not much in the way of games or videos but do a lot of web searches for information, etc. and use the Apple version of Word and Excel (Pages & Numbers).  These 2 apps are not as user friendly as their counterparts but I'm getting more familiar with them.  I've never had an Apple product before and I'm not sure if this will be my last.  After all, you can get an SSD with other laptops and there's something to be said about getting a computer that already comes with everything that you might need without having to spend more getting them."}

Never had an issues with it that didn't get fixed by support. It ran no problem for the longest time. I had some issued with the mag safe adapter and in the end had to reboot the computer because of a mistake I made on installing it. Once I did it's like I got malware right from the get go. After all those years I reboot it update it and bam, advertisements and a slow computer ever since. I was never able to fix it and believe me I tried. It was getting old and I broke the screen so I decided to upgrade to a new one. Well same thing with this one, right off the bat I have adware, I dl adware medic and nothing, I just dl a virus software and nothing. It runs slow, can't do what I want it to do and I'm running into all kinds of stupid problems. The mouse disappears, videos can't stream, fb has all kinds of problems with video and sound. Everywhere I go I see adds. I have been researching and dealing with this adware problem for months on end now. Iv'e gone up and down through all kinds of blogs, dl programs that are supposed to fix it, changed settings, removed programs, rebooted, updated. My old mac was adware and virus free for years and years. That's why I pay the premium for this equipment so I don't have to deal with it.\n\nFor 2200 bucks and coming from a huge company like apple this thing should be a beast like my old one was. Especially since it cost a THOUSAND  DOLLARS MORE!!! Not happy one bit with this computer. Now I'm 30-40 days past my return timeframe and will have to battle it out with amazon cs and most likely apple too. I'm pretty much at the point where I'm just gonna send it back and not pay my charge card off.\n\nApple if you wanna charge top dollar for your stuff make sure they're still beasts like they used to be!"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00UGBMRQ8", "review": "I've used my early 2015 13\" Retina MBP pretty intensively every day. I'm evaluating it relative to my 11\" recent-year fully loaded MB Air and the most recent non-retina MB Pro, which I used for a year at work.\n\nHere are my impressions of the 2015 rMBP so far, relative to these other Macbooks:\n\n* Display\n\nThis is the main reason I bought the rMBP and I'm absolutely thrilled with it. It blows away every other Macbook's display except of course the 15\" retina MB Pro. (The 15\" Pro is too big and heavy for my needs, and is overdue for a refresh.) For years, I've been running my MB Airs with an external monitor, a pretty decent 25\" 1080p IPS display, and I was happy with this setup. No more! The external monitor and obviously the MB Air's display are a major step down from the rMBP's display. I'm spoiled - it would be really hard for me to go back now that I'm used to the MBP's gorgeous high-res display.\n\n* Weight\n\nThe 13\" rMBP weighs 3.5 pounds. Whether that feels like a burden or a breeze will depend on what you're comparing it to.\n\nI'm coming from a 2.4 pound 11\" Macbook Air, which I brought with me almost everywhere, including to work every day. The extra pound of the 13\" Pro is very noticeable. The weight of the pro was the only reason I hesitated choosing it over a 2015 MB Air.\n\nIf you're comparing the Pro to the 13\" MB Air, the Pro is only 1/2 pound heavier. If you're comparing the Pro to similarly configured Windows laptops, many of which weigh 3 to 4 pounds, it's in the same ballpark in terms of size and weight. If you're comparing the Pro to the 13\" non-Retina Macbook Pro (yes they still sell these), the non-Retina Pro weighs a full pound more than the 13\" rMBP.\n\nFor me, the Pro's extra weight relative to the MB Air is a compromise I'm willing to make in order to have a much more powerful machine with a much better display. Plus, I no longer need to bring my laptop with me everywhere now; sometimes it's fine to just bring my iPad mini 2 and external keyboard. (It helps that MS Office is available on iPad now, and IMHO it's pretty good.)\n\n* Force track pad\n\nThe \"force\" part -- pressing the track pad harder to activate different features -- is not supported in most applications now, but more and more applications will support it in the coming year. Until that happens, it works great as a regular trackpad - better than the (already excellent) trackpad on previous MB Pros and Airs. I like using the new trackpad pretty well. But it's not a killer feature, and in the future when more apps take advantage of it it will probably be like having a third mouse button--handy, but hardly essential.\n\n* Speed & Performance\n\nThe 2015 rMBP has a newer generation of processor and graphics. Everything feels very fast, including bootup times, app startup, running apps, ripping music CDs, etc. That said, the 2014 model feels very fast, too, and I don't think most people will notice any speed improvements with the 2015 model over the 2014 model in normal everyday usage.\n\nApple claims the 2015 model's flash SSD is twice as fast as the SSD in the 2014 model. Independent testing from professional review sites have verified this. However, in normal usage, I don't notice much difference - the SSD in last year's model is pretty dang fast.\n\n* Battery life\n\nApple claims 10 hours to a charge, compared with 9 hours on last year's model. Independent tests by professional reviewers largely support Apple's claim: Laptopmag.com reports 12 hours 4 minutes; PCMag.com gets 11 hours 10 minutes; CNET gets a whopping 15 hours 42 minutes.\n\nThese figures are stellar, but the testing conditions are not realistic. In real-world usage, there are so many things that affect battery life.\n\nDuring my first 10 days with this machine, I never got more than 8 hours and usually more like 7. After much research & diagnostics, including a visit to the Genius Bar, I tried what all of you reading this must think is the obvious thing to try: I turned down the screen brightness. It turns out that you get a couple extra hours of battery life on 50% brightness compared to 80% brightness. I can now get close to 10 hours, maybe a bit more. I *prefer* having the screen brightness at 80%, and often leave it there while running on battery as long as I know I won't be away from an outlet for more than 6 hours. But for those rare times when I do need maximum battery life, I know I can get it by dialing back screen brightness to 40-50%.\n\n* Summary: should you buy one?\n\nBuy a retina MB Pro instead of an Air if you want a MUCH better display, more connectivity, a more powerful system, and don't mind an extra 1/2 pound relative to the 13\" MB Air (or full pound relative to the 11\" Air).\n\nIf you choose the 13\" retina MBP, I'd encourage you to shop around for good deals on last year's model. It has the same excellent screen, keyboard, design, and same exact weight and dimensions. The 2014 model doesn't have the new force trackpad, but I think most people can easily live without this. The new 2015 model is slightly faster, but I think most people won't notice the differences in every day usage--I wouldn't. If you can save $300 by getting last year's model, that seems like a no-brainer to me. I didn't do it because I'm a teacher, and with my education discount at the Apple online store I got a 2015 model for about the same price as the best deal I could find on last year's model"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00UGBMRQ8", "review": "BLUF: Excellent laptop in every regard. Keyboard and Force trackpad are simply unmatched. OS X is delightful, yet it is powerful enough to run Windows 10 and Linux virtual machines if you must.\n\nI am a highly experienced IT with in-depth knowledge of Windows and Linux. I still dislike Apple policies and processes and refused to pay more for the same (Apple maintains a strict 30%+ profit margin). The last and only Apple device I owned before this MBP was an original iPod, because there were simply no better alternatives.\n\nThat being said, I love this MacBook Pro.\n\nDue to an upcoming long-term business trip, I decided to get a new laptop computer in the 13-14\" form factor. I had been eyeing the Dell XPS 13 and the Razer Blade Stealth. Dell and Razer have excellent laptops in many ways superior to this dated MBP design but also suffer from quality control problems, and lackluster keyboards and trackpads. After careful consideration and with full knowledge that a new MBP is expected in a couple of months, I decided to buy this laptop.\n\nAgain, I love it.\n\nI just couldn't find a better alternative when it comes to quality. This thing feels solid throughout. Typing is a breeze. With every laptop I owned, I had been forced to rely on an external mouse when trackpad after trackpad failed to deliver an intuitive and reliable experience. That is not the case here. The Force Trackpad is marvelous.\n\nAfter the easiest setup process ever, I have migrated all my important data, set up my wireless devices, set up automatic backups, and smart card compatibility. Let me tell you, the praise for OS X is not overstated. It is so simple. The more I learn about it the more I realize it just works! The transition from Windows to OS X was no big deal.\n\nI have been using Windows 10 for over a year. Before that, I pushed through 8 and 8.1, and really missed 7. 10 is the best Windows out there. Microsoft really stepped it up and delivered. However, there are still bugs, blue screens of sadness, and all that jazz. There are still incompatible drivers, broken applications, and malware. You know, the things I have yet to experience on my short time driving OS X hard.\n\nWith the use of Parallels, I created the Windows 10 and Linux (Kali) virtual machines I use for work. The integration between OS X and Windows Parallels is amazing. I have tons of experience with virtualization: VMWare, Citrix, Microsoft, and Oracle flavors. They all have their strengths, but for productivity between Windows and OS X, nothing matches Parallels VMs in Coherence Mode. If you must use other OS as well, this is the way to go.\n\nKeep in mind, the MacBook Pro line is due for a significant refresh. Apple is expected to release more details shortly and there are rumors that the new devices will be up for sale between FY16 Q3 and FY17 Q1. Not only is a refreshed design and a slimmer form factor expected, but also newer, faster, and more efficient processors, upgraded memory, replacement of F-Keys with an OLED display, and almighty Thunderbolt 3. If you can wait, you definitely should. If you can't, you can take a chance with the other manufacturers, or go for the solid and proven MBP line. I bet you won't be disappointed."}

Not only does the new MacBook perform better and has a longer battery charge, but also now has an ingenious touchpad that lets you do a lot more than just point and click. Aside from that, the MacBook Pro provides quality service that makes life a bit easier. Im a student and I choose to buy my first MacBook Pro back in 2010 because I found the programs to be quicker in loading and processing information on their OS. In addition, its design is simple but unique, as its weight, quite unnoticeable to me. Its been improving in all aspects since then and has made walks around campus or making yourself comfortable anywhere to use it, a lot easier. The features that the new MacBook Pro offers are amazing and to some extent, unbeatable. Firs off, my MacBook lasted about 5 years before it began to bother me with small viruses. Found myself saving money in that area with the MacBook while on my old laptop it was not the same scenario. Second, the home interface it simple but unique. While other PCs are customizable without having to hack it, the MacBook is still able provide a slick interface design; Starting at $1,299, the MacBook Pro is available in almost all tech related websites that are certified like, Amazon, Ebay, and Apple of course, and so on. Now some of these websites offer a better package but with a different or same price. Once you chose where to order it from, now its time to decided on how quick you want it to be delivered to you. There are usually three choices and I think most of these website offer them, Original delivery, 2-day delivery, and 1-day delivery. Of course the 2-day and 1-day can be quite expensive (vary on each website) but I prefer to have my items delivered to me as soon as possible. Like any other product out there, the MacBook has pros and cons. But I only found a few things in this area that I found reasonable to mention. The pros are that it has a bright display, fast hard drive speed, Innovative Force Touch trackpad, and very long battery life. As for the cons, its not as thin and light as competition, and the SD card sticks out when inserted. Overall the MacBook was worth buying because it provided me with great applications, learning experience, and is simply a must-have if you are in college. With a great Operating System and not having to spend much money on virus protection, the MacBook is convenient for everyone."}

The reason for that is because I wanted to have a good chance to use the laptop for some time and experience its functions closely. After a couple of months of using this product, I finally could say that it's the best thing that I have ever bought up to this moment. The laptop works great and the package was delivered on time. Regardless to the fact that the outside box was damaged, the inside box was fine.\n  I use this laptop every single day for at least 2 hours and believe me it's just great. Therefore, my advice to you if you're a student and you need a laptop for school, this laptop is the best choice for you. And if you're concerned about the system, I would tell you that as a person who has never used a MacBook before actually buying it, do not worry you will get used to it in no time as I did."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00UGBMRQ8", "review": "I recently purchased this MacBook Pro to replace a 2011 year model and oh wow, what a difference! The screen is certainly the best reason to upgrade in case you are contemplating on doing this. With my old Macbook Pro I had to have the screen at a particular angle to see the picture properly or to see colors properly. Not so with this model. No matter how you have your screen angled, you will see the picture accurately and it looks awesome.\n\nI am a web designer and programmer by profession and it's very important to me to have a really good screen. The 15 inch size is wonderful and large enough to do my job right. Any smaller and I would feel cramped probably. I do my main work on my 27\" iMac when it comes to doing graphic design work or development but just for doing maintenance and upgrades on websites, using Wordpress for example, I enjoy sitting on my couch with this laptop instead of at my desk.\n\nThe trackpad is simply awesome as well. Yesterday I had to fix something on my neighbor's laptop, a Dell, and I got so frustrated because I'm so used to the Macbook's trackpad. On this PC laptop you couldn't click anywhere on the trackpad, only on the very bottom. Nor could I scroll up and down easily with that thing. With the Macbook trackpad you can use multiple finger gestures, for example just use two fingers simultaneously to scroll up or down. That is so much more intuitive than that PC's trackpad. For that reason alone I would switch from PC to a Mac. Not even mentioning working with Windows 10 versus OS El Capitan. Who are these Windows developers anyway that can't make anything straight forward?\n\nNow, I was very pleased that my new laptop already came with 16GB RAM. Most laptops still come with only 8GB of RAM. I have 32GB on my iMac but I can't say it's any faster than my new MacBook Pro.\n\nI have no negative comments on my Macbook Pro. Maybe it would have been nice to have a touch screen as well, but I'm okay without that because I own the iPad Pro 12.9\" as well. You may wonder why I also got the MacBook Pro if I already own the big iPad. The answer is: there are still many things that I do, especially with my work, that are done easier on a real computer, but not necessarily by having to sit in my office.\n\nBTW if you are comparing or debating between a Windows touch screen laptop with a Macbook Pro without a touch screen. I will still recommend the Macbook Pro hands down!!! If quality and ease of use is important to you, there is no other choice.\n\nI use the iMac for creating and developing. I use my Macbook for personal things and for simple updates and maintenance on websites. I use my iPad Pro for entertainment, playing games, browsing amazon, traveling and much more. I love having exactly the right type of device when and where I need it.\n\nI know this Macbook Pro doesn't come cheap. But think of it as making a good investment. Macbook laptops last longer, hold better resale value, are of extremely good quality, and will never let you down. Using the OS operating system is a breeze.\n\nA quick story to end my review. A month ago a friend of mine who owned a Lenovo laptop asked me to erase data from her laptop. I thought, no big deal because how hard can it be? Well, it took me all day, just about. Of course not being used to Windows 10 didn't help, but in order to perform certain actions, I had to go all over the place on the computer to do them and often the screen would freeze on me (something that never happens on my iMac or Macbook). Nothing was straight forward. I kept having to ask Google how to do the simplest of tasks and the answers were always complicated. You'd think the control panel could handle all my requests but no, the Windows control panel is nothing like Settings or Preferences on an Apple device. About the quality of that Lenovo laptop itself. The screen wasn't half bad, I admit, but the keyboard was AWFUL!!!!!! Each time I pressed on a key, the entire keyboard moved down with it... it had a very plasticky and cheap feel.\n\nGet a Macbook Pro if you're in the market for a laptop. Even if you're coming from a Windows device. The transition isn't all that bad. If you own an older model of the Macbook Pro, I highly recommend upgrading because the screen will blow you away and the speed of this laptop is unsurpassed.\n\nTip: it's a really good idea to get a case for this beautiful laptop. I did and it's fantastic. It's the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Thule-Vectros-15-34-MacBook-Pro-Retina-Bumper-3203225/dp/B0149QC6I4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Thule Vectros 15\" MacBook Pro Retina Bumper (3203225)</a>&nbsp;for $59 but it's well worth the price to protect your investment. It was very easy to put on and it looks really cool!\n\nSo what are you waiting for? Take it from a professional. Just get this Macbook Pro!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00UGBMRQ8", "review": "My review is based on the fact that I got a pretty good value on this when it was selling for $200 less than normal. And still the case 3 months later.\nI'm probably a bit biased on Macs since I'm a professional graphic designer, and it's just the industry standard. I've owned Apple computers for use for my business for over 25 years.\n\nThe benefits have remained pretty consistent in terms of Apple designing computers that are ahead of the curve, beautifully and thoughtfully designed  both in terms of industrial design as well as system architecture and ease of use. They are also built to last with quality being a major consideration in the design. I owned my previous Apple laptop for 7 years with no issues, with heavy use pretty much 40-60 hours a week. The only Apple computer to fail on me is a Powerbook that I spilled a full glass of Pinot Noir into.\n\nIf you're considering a switch from Windows based PCs to Apple computers, I'd probably recommend that you look at what you're going to use it for. What software do you need to run? What's your budget? etc.  These MacBook Pro computers are expensive. For some of us, even though they are more expensive, they still offer the better value. I think for others they are just buying into the brand.\n\nIf you're a student on a budget and just need a laptop to write papers and do general word processing, unless you're rich, a less expensive PC might be a better option for you. Spend the savings on something important, like food, rent, etc. If money isn't an option, you can't do much better than this. Again, it depends of what you want to do with it."}

Beware that El Captian is a significant evolution and, if you waited a long time to update, much of your software may no longer be compatible. I checked with Roaring Apps for compatibility before hand but my Adobe 5.5 was not so functional as the site indicated it should be. I could limp along but not save anything. I ended up upgrading to the Adobe Cloud annual membership. It's all worth it. But understand when you buy this computer,  you can't go backwards to Yosemite or Mavericks. Intitially there were some bugs connecting to my iPad 2 ( yeah, I'm a Luddite) but the new El Capitan upgrade fixed that. The Wacom tablet (Intuos) works with a revised software download from the Wacom website. They say the toggle button on the stylus doesn't work but that broke off ages ago. Microsoft Office 8 is not compatible, 12 is...and so on and so forth."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00UGBMRQ8", "review": "I've had two windows laptops and both of them eventually suffered from many different issues on both structural and functional levels. I decided to make the switch to mac from reading that macs tend to have better reliability and build quality and bought the 2015 Macbook Pro 13.3 inch.\n\nThe macbook pro simply oozes with superb build quality. The metal unibody and inner parts are all seamless, form fitting, and tight together. I don't get the impression that things will be getting loose and janky like my previous laptops.\n\nThe trackpad is also superb. It is also metal instead of plastic and feels much nicer. Basic moving and scrolling is much more responsive and smooth. The mac specific gestures also work really well and are just as responsive and smooth. The vibration simulated trackpad click (featured on the 2015 model) feels more crisp and smooth compared to a mechanical trackpad and allows for even clicking responses and sensation throughout which is also nice. I found the extra \"force touch\" click to not be of much personal use and that it turned on when I didn't want it to when wanting to drag. I just turned the force touch click off and everything is fine now.\n\nThe display is great. Compared to other laptops, the colors are more rich, deep, and vibrant, and everything is nice and sharp.\n\nThe speakers produce a much nicer quality sound than on most other laptops, even at higher volumes.\n\nThe keyboard feels nice and clicky and is very responsive. It's also not too loud.\n\nThe magsafe charger definitely helps protect my macbook from falls because of its magnetic mechanism rather than being a mechanical mechanism. It's already saved my laptop from at least one potential fall. The red vs. green charging light on the charger itself is a nice touch. The charger also comes with an optional extension cord that fits into the charger, which I really like. The clips on the charger allow for wrapping of the cords for travel which is also nice.\n\nUnfortunately, the hinge of the laptop has a plastic covering rather than being a seamless metal piece like current higher end windows laptops have. However, the long unibody plastic hinge placed in the middle seems and feels much more structurally sound than the small plastic hinges placed on either side that I had on my windows laptops.\n\nEverything runs fast and smooth without a single hitch.\n\nThe macbook pro produces much less heat and noise than my previous laptops.\n\nI always keep my charger on me and plugged into the laptop so battery life is not as important of a concern to me, but I appreciate that the macbook pro's long battery life will serve me well should I ever forget to bring my charger with me or I am not near a outlet. Because of it's energy efficiency, it's nice to know that I will not be damaging the battery by running it down as low as I would have to on other laptops.\n\nThe mac OS experience did take me some getting used to, but I found that it's still mostly similar to using windows and it works fine for my needs. For anything I'm confused about, I can easily find answers through Google searching. (For former windows users, I would recommend downloading RedQuits which allows for total closing of an application when you click \"x\" just like on Windows)\n\nOverall, I really like my macbook pro and found that it was a great deal through Amazon Warehouse Deals."}

After 5 months of being without a laptop, I took the leap and applied for a Barclay Visa with Apple rewards. I was immediately approved and was able to start using my credit immediately to purchase the 13\" via Apple's online store. I debated over the advantages/disadvantages of 13\" versus 15\". I really wanted something smaller that I could carry around easily. From my previous experience with a 15\" laptop, it's more cumbersome to deal with. I choose the 512GB because I needed more storage and was of deleting files to make room. It's super quiet and fast. I also love that it starts up and shuts down quickly. It was super simple to do the initial setup. Coming from using Windows Vista was a change, but I'm enjoying learning to navigate iOS.

After a brief period of adjustment I came to love the interface; it's much more intuitive and useful than Windows for the kind of work I do online. Yet, for all of those advantages, there appears to be both durability and customer service problems with Apple products worth considering.\n\nFirst the durability problem: A fan failed after only two months, making a loud whirring and grinding sound whenever the computer was in use. I had bought the extended Apple Care package, and took the laptop into the Apple Store for service. They did not have the part in stock. So I would have to go back when the part arrived. I was told that they may be able to do the repair while I waited since it is only a 20-minute repair.\n\nI got a message that the part arrived, and called to schedule my second appointment (second trip to the mall, second day wasted on a new, malfunctioning computer) for the repair. I arrived early for my appointment and was told to occupy myself for 30 minutes or so until my appointment time since they were busy. After wandering the mall with my broken MacBook for 30 minutes, I returned. At check-in I was told I didn't need an appointment since I was dropping my computer off for repair. I corrected them that I was waiting for them to complete the repair while I waited; they countered that this would not be possible and that I would have to leave the computer for the repair to be completed. By the way, be sure your data is backed up, because we might erase your harddrive while fixing this fan.\n\nSo I just called to see if any progress has been made. There was no record that any has been. I am to expect my 20-minute repair to be completed within 48 hours. I wonder if I will need an appointment to pick it up?"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00UGBMRQ8", "review": "This is the best computer I've ever used, but I don't think it is for everyone.  Previously, I owned the 13\" Retina version, which is probably a better choice for almost everyone.  It was a better size and weight, plenty of power, convenient and a joy to use.  But for me, I'm a research statistician working with large genetics files, I need major computing power and memory.  I frequently analyze data files  sized in the tens of GB.  Sometimes I run these analyses on a server cluster.  Even on the cluster, the run times are not exactly fast, but it works just fine.  This 15\" MBP is indeed slower than the servers (how could it not be?), but it holds its own.  With four cores I can crunch through a lot of data at a quick pace, lots of memory for quick data access.  And if I run out of memory (a frequent occurrence), the new version of OS X will create virtual memory out of the super fast SSD.  Most computers will create this virtual memory, but will not do this when managing large files in R.  Now I can load a 50GB object into R and the computer runs just fine.\n\nIn short, if you are into heavy data analysis and want to do it on a laptop, this is the one for you.  GIS, Genomics, Medicare data, these files are BIG and need some powerful hardware, this computer is plenty sufficient, with plenty of leftover resources to run Office or Internet will the numbers are crunching."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00UGBMRQ8", "review": "I have used PCs throughout my life and I still use them for work and gaming. I feel that when it comes to raw horsepower, customization, cost and simplicity of use, you cant beat PCs. But this review is not about PCs :).\n\nThis laptop is second Mac in our household. The earlier one was 11inch mac that we bought for my wife because she wanted something portable and light. At that time we looked for other options but it turned out that it was really the best.\n\nWhy I chose Macbook Pro 13 retina display -\n1) Battery Life - After using numerous windows machines, I have to accept that they cant even come close to battery life of a macbook. Since this laptop is purely going to be used for work, I needed something which I can carry and don't have to charge all the time and I have to say that it doesn't disappoint. It has great battery life.\n\n2) Trackpad - Oh boy, if any windows laptop can come even close to making a trackpad like the one mac has, I can switch in a heartbeat. Even the recent Windows surface book isn't as good as Mac trackpad. Now you might ask, ok but whats the big deal. The big deal is that since it is a laptop, you will be doing majority of stuff using trackpad and the smoothness and multitouch just makes things fast and easier with less steps involved. The trackpad enhances the laptop experience and makes you use your laptop with ease. Moreover since Mac & iOS and trackpad is made by apple, both operating system and hardware jells together is a harmony, resulting in excellent experience.\n\n3) Design - I am not taking about this being pretty, my point is ruggedness. It feels solid, it feels premium, it feels a machine well made. And ofcourse it had good aesthetics. Very elegant.\n\nCons -\n1) Memory hog - Man I cant believe my frustration that the OS is such a memory hog. I mean is freaking 8 GB of memory not enough. It has SSD with i5 and 8gb RAM, it should fly, but unfortunately no it wont. It slows down even if you have couple of applications open with few browser windows. Yes even with this small amount of stress. I have to constantly clean the memory with an app to make sure I can do stuff without slowing down. It is really frustrating.\n\n2) OS - Mac OS looks pretty but there are so many things that need to be optimized. Safari utilizes so much memory. Basic work apps like MS office aren't optimized for mac. They have come a long way but still not as smooth as windows, of course. Apps won't shut down if you close the windows, you have to close by using command+q. I know people will say but man it has been like this with Macs, I understand but that doesn't mean Mac cant evolve. When I click on close, the process should shut down and free memory so as to keep the machine running at good speed. People say Macs don't crash, I am sorry it has happened to me on brand new mac after a use of few hours. Had to force restart.\n\n3) Cost - Frankly they do cost a bit more than pcs with similar specs. The comparison would be apple to oranges but still if thats the case then I would expect a mac to be blazing fast at that cost which it isn't.\n\n4) Customization - Unfortunately as of now you cant upgrade third party parts into Mac. So if you bought 128gb like me, you are stuck and bigger apple drives are firstly limited availability, they are used parts taken out of other macs and very expensive. Like super expensive. So you are really stuck with what you have. This is the problem with the 2015 model. I hope in future apple will release parts to customize and upgrade but as of now, sorry.\n\nFinal words - I like this laptop for lighter work and it suits the goal for which I bought this for. But this is not a perfect machine. It can surely improve. If you are looking for a stable laptop for work which is portable, had excellent battery life and easy to use due to its great touchpad, then please get this laptop.\n\nIf you are looking for a very powerful machine at the same price but aren't worried about weight, design or smoothness of trackpad, might as well go with windows options as there are many. Please mind that this will slow down eve with relatively lighter use.\n\nThis is an honest review. I am not an apple hater or windows lover. It is what it is. We have all sort of devices in our household. I am keeping this laptop because as a \"Laptop\" it does its job pretty darn well."}

And I've used Windows 10 daily and extensively since it came out before switching.\n\nGreat Aesthetics:\n\nFirst impressions, excellent looking laptop and very light! Ive owned an asus Vivobook prior to this Macbook and this one is pretty light in comparison. I LOVE the keyboard and the trackpad - I finally get it now why both of these have rave reviews.\n\nWindows to Mac:\n\nThere's definitely many differences, especially with the keyboard shortcuts. You'll find that your fingers will have to get used to touching new key combinations which aren't as comfortable as with windows.\n\nTransferring files from a non-iphone phone, like Android is extremely annoying. It's NOT plug and play. You will have to install applications on your phone and Mac to be able to do this. And even when you have these applications, it still isn't as convenient and straight forward as with windows.\n\nThe battery life is good - I get about 5-6 hours of non stop typing, with 3 browsers opened and wifi always on. Excel sheet, word and other apps opened.\n\nElectric static. This is the most annoying thing. Everytime the charger is on the laptop, My left wrist will ALWAYS get stung when it touches the side of the chassis. Ive researched this and it is very common and apple says it's normal. Well, i've owned laptops from other brands and non of them showed potential of ELECTRICUTING me."}

The retina display is also very nice. If you are a college student, I would highly recommend this laptop, or the macbook air. The macbook air has an even longer battery life than the macbook pro.\n\nNot only is this the longest lasting laptop that I have ever owned, it is easily the fastest laptop by a long shot. I have owned this thing all throughout college, and after two and a half to three years I can honestly say that it is basically as fast as it was brand new. Many other laptops that I have owned would be decently fast for about a year or a year and a half then it will start to decrease in speed. I was hoping that it would not be the case for this laptop since I paid a lot for it, but I was very happy to find out that it was not the case."}

As seemingly inconsequential as a single key gone awry may seem, it has certainly mae my life much harer. You see, I o a lot of writing on my Macbook Pro. I also nee to use that specific key in for many shortcut actions in Photoshop, which I use in part to make my living.\n\nNow this might seem like a minor issue for anyone with a broken keyboar; why not just go get the thing fixe? Thats the specific issue Im having myself. I went to a local Apple Store, an a genius of yours inspecte the keyboar. At first he figure that the key may just be in nee of cleaning - unlikely as I baby my 2-year-ol $1,700 Macbook Pro. Its my primary (an only) machine, an as a college stuent, I cant affor to replace it if it gets amage. After the genius returne with my laptop, he tol me that a rubber cup beneath the key itself came loose, an that it cant be repaire on its own, but that the entire top case must be replace, for a sweet $310. $310 because one key stoppe working.\n\nNow this is particularly upsetting to me, because Ive never spille anything on my laptop. I keep particular care aroun the use of my laptop because I bibnt buy a warranty. Why bibnt I buy a warranty? Because that extenbeb warranty shoul be meant to cover accibents cause by the customer. It shoulnt be a necessity in orber to make a $1,700 laptop work longer than two years.\n\nBib I learn my lesson? oes it serve me right that I bibnt buy a warranty? No, I learne that Apple makes crappy probucts that necessitate the purchase of a warranty in orber to own. So insteab of shelling out $310 for a top case replacement, Im just going to buy a $10 keyboar an look like an ibiot everytime I go out to a Cafe to sit own an use my laptop or to meet up with a client to work on a project.\n\nThanks so much, Apple.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00UGBMRQ8", "review": "I didn't actually buy my MacBook Pro from Amazon, but I wanted to post a review on Amazon since this is where I make the majority of my purchases.\n\nThis MacBook Pro is one of the best purchasing decisions I've made in recent years. Is it pricey? Yes. But I'm of the opinion that it's better to pay more for something of good quality that will last for a while instead of having to buy a new \"disposable\" Windows computer for $200-300 every single year. Every Mac computer I ever had was replaced because I simply wanted to upgrade, not because there was anything wrong with the computer. In fact, they've always worked just as well on the last day I've used them as they did on the first day I got them.\n\nI had been a Windows user until 2009 when I bought my first MacBook, the model that was all white and made of plastic. I thought it was the coolest looking computer ever. I also fell in love with OS X. A year and a half later, I bought the 2010 version of the 15\" MacBook Pro. I used that MacBook until 2014 when, due to my own carelessness, the screen broke. I was a grad student at the time and although I was more than willing to throw down the money for a new MacBook Pro, I wasn't financially able to do so. Instead, I bought a Chromebook and used it for a year.\n\nI respect Chrome OS, but it doesn't meet my needs. So a month ago, I bought a 2015 MacBook Pro retina 13\", and I'm thrilled to be back in a Mac. With a Mac, I'm never worried about losing important files, crashes, or incompatible peripherals. When I had a Windows computer, it would frequently freeze up and I found myself Ctrl-Alt-Delete'ing several times per week. And I thought that was normal, but Mac OS X is in a totally different league.\n\nThe most difficult thing for a Windows user is going to be navigating the OS X. There's no 'Start' button, for one thing. Instead, you open the Finder and, from there, access your applications (programs) or your hard drive (like 'My Computer') where you can find all your files. But when you put aside the (very small) learning curve, this MacBook Pro--which is in the upper-middle range of the current Mac Pro lineup--is going to be faster, more powerful, and more reliable than ANY Windows computer that you'd buy for the same price and probably even more. When you consider the fact that Mac viruses are a rarity and that programs install more like apps rather than like trees that plant roots throughout your entire system, Mac OS X is naturally going to be a more stable computing experience. And I'm only really touching on the most basic benefits of this computer, without even getting into some of the more specific features or bells and whistles.\n\nPut aside the fact that this computer is higher in quality and more reliable than just about any Windows house you'd find.. The retina screen means that actually using the computer is going to be an incredibly immersive experience. Videos, pictures, and even web-browsing is going to look stunning. The computer boots in about 15-20 seconds, the hard drive is incredibly peppy, and there's also the fact that the computer itself is well-made and looks sleek. Honestly, if you have the money to invest in this computer you'll be very happy that you did, even if you're currently a Windows user. There are countless YouTube tutorials and demos that will show you have to navigate and use Mac OS X, so don't let the learning curve scare you away. Think about it like this: If you were to buy a computer today, how long do you want that computer to last? If your answer is anything more than a year or two, buy this MacBook Pro (or even another model)."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00UGBMRQ8", "review": "I bought the 2015 retina MBP with a 256 gb drive to do web development in mid December. It was my first Mac. I bought it because my Samsung laptop running Windows 10 was having trouble installing and running some Node.js tools: Grunt and Gulp. Those tools were essential to my web development. Because those tools were built to run in a Unix environment they never seemed to run properly in Windows: Constant install hassles and constant errors.\n\nThe MPB runs them with aplomb. They installed fast and ran with no errors on the first go. They just worked.\n\nI was a bit worried about the transition from Windows (which I've been using since 3.1) but so far its been no problem. OSX is built on Unix, and I had some Linux experience, so dropping to the bash terminal (which is a pleasure to use) when I need to has been no problem at all. Other than that, things are named differently and live in different places than Windows, but some quick google searches have really helped me out.\n\nAs for the machine, its beautiful. Amazing build quality compared to the Samsungs, Lenovos, IBM ThinkPads and Toshibas I've used in the past. The machine boots in like 10 seconds and sleeps reliably when I close the lid (Something Windows laptops don't seem to get right.) The keyboard is nice. The force-touch trackpad is the best I've used. The retina screen makes me never want to go back. The machine is blazing fast, although I don't do any graphics intensive tasks like heavy Photoshopping or video editing. This speed is probably attributable to the very good hardware as well as the super-efficient operating system. I didn't need to install any drivers to get the machine to recognize my Android phone. The battery lasts at least 10 hours for me, about 9 if I'm streaming Netflix. I've stopped playing games so I can't speak to gaming performance or battery life. If I started playing games again, I'd probably want a Windows machine to do it on though.\n\nComplaints I have: Time Machine seems to stall sometimes (Not for hours, I interrupt it and restart if it stalls for more than 5 or 10 minutes. I should probably just let it run but I'm impatient.) The speakers were a bit quiet for me so I installed Boom 2 volume booster. I can't get the HDMI out to display full screen on my TV (Probably a resolution incompatibility.) I wish the machine had at least one more USB port. (I have an inexpensive portable external monitor that uses USB. When I hook that up (Which is most of the time when I'm working at my desk,) I'm down to one port to plug in my external devices. I have to resort to a USB hub if I want to plug more than one thing in.)\n\nOverall, I'm more than satisfied with the purchase so far. I won't be using Windows machines in the future unless I'm forced to by work or something. I fully expect this machine to last much longer than the average 2 years of a Windows PC.\n\nMacs just work and the rMBP works great for me."}

My frustration with other products and with Windows, in general as an operating system, was my motivation to move to an Apple product and i don't regret it. Solid build quality unlike anything on the market and really not too expensive for what you get. You can get an even better deal if you hunt for any last season warehouse models. Mac OS runs nice and smooth and rarely do you stumble on hangups, crashes or issues on this device. It is a balanced piece of software and hardware.. The Retina display is brilliant, upto 8 hrs of battery life and speakers are pretty good.. However some people may complain about the limitations of having little ports and connectors as this was a sacrifice for portability and elegance.. It is perfect for those looking for a total end user experience with as little tinkering as possible and love to have a device that does their day to day needs with little to almost no software housekeeping, hiccups or software issues."}

Many of my coworkers use MAC products and love them, so I decided to consider a Mac.  I do a lot of photography so I wanted to make sure my laptop would be able to handle it.  My last laptop was a 17\", and I was a little concerned if 15\" would be big enough to edit photos, but after using the macbook with the retina display I can honestly say I prefer editing on the 15\" Retina.  It took me a couple weeks and watching some Youtube tutorials to get used to the Mac, but after I figured it out I LOVE it!  I will never own anything else.  The Battery will last easily 9 hrs, and charges to 100% in less than 3 hrs.  The processor is lighting fast, I never saw the Loading umbrella until I had owned the computer at least a month.  The build quality is superb.  It was a decent chunk of change to drop on a computer, but I love everything about it.  I'll probably my my wife a macbook pro too.

Having owned MacBooks since 2009-2012 (upgrading to the latest Macbook Pro each year) what Apple has done is phenomenal. A lot of people complained about no Ethernet ports but Apple has been an industry leader and knows the pulse of technology and market direction.\nPros -\nGreat design and the unibody design is timeless.\nThe dimensions and width make this laptop very portable and fits the airline trays comfortably.\nMuch better graphics processor than competing Windows laptops as it includes IRIS chips. Very few other machines have a 28W TDP chip.\nFast SSD makes operations a breeze.\nThe retina screen is a delight\nExcellent battery life.\n\nCons -\nI believe Apple can improve the screen resolution. When this machine was launched in 2012, a 1200x800 (times 2 for Retina) was great. To run a higher resolution there is extra load on the iGPU as it has to scale and display content. This causes some lag for data rich webpages or Facebook. Apple should increase the screen resolution to 2880x1440 or higher in the next iteration to give us more screen real estate.\n\nFuture Roadmap -\nI'd like to see some of the enhancements from the rMB like thinner screen, terraced batteries brought into this machine."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00UGBMRQ8", "review": "Computers are used by all ages and I have no doubt the MacBook Pro with Retina Display is suitable for anyone. After my Sony Viao computer crashed in early November, I purchased the MacBook Pro with Retina Display on November 15, 2015 for around $1,500. As a college student it was certainly quite the investment. The computers I purchase are mainly utilized for word processing, PowerPoint displays and storage as well as speed.\n\nI evaluated the Apple MacBook Pro with Retina Display with the most emphasis on speed of processing. It is obvious that an Internet connection can play a large role in the speed of a computer. As a result, I analyzed the computer when it was not connected to an Internet source. The Apple MacBook Pro with Retina Display is considerably faster than any other computer I have worked on. I was impressed, when running multiple programs at once as the computer never slows down.  The speed of the MacBook Pro is very noticeable when I am forced to use a laptop other than an Apple MacBook Pro with Retina Display.\n\nAnother main focus of my evaluation was of the availability technological support provided through Apple Inc. When first setting up my Apple MacBook Pro display, I had some complications with getting the computer synced with my iPhone. I contacted the Apple Technology Support and only was on hold for approximately three minutes before someone was happy to assist me. I was even more impressed by the Apple Support website, it includes the answer to any complication you can imagine.\n\nMy only slight criticism of the Apple MacBook Pro with Retina Display is that I personally do not think spending the extra money for the Retina Display provides any benefit. I have not been able to tell the difference in the resolution of the display when compared with a computer who lacks the Retina Display.\n\nOverall I can still confidently say, I am impressed with the Apple MacBook Pro with Retina Display. I have been impressed not only by this product but also Apple Inc. as a company in general. I certainly am happy with my purchase!"}

This laptop is way better then i was expecting (This is my first mac and I'm NEVER going back to windows) My mac \"just works\" it has never disappointed, It wins in all departments over windows.  My mac has a metal body (Most high end windows are still made from plastic) that just shows how much more they are interested in money than quality."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00UGBMRQ8", "review": "Fully loaded MacBook pro was provided to me to replace the MacBook Air standard company issue that began wheezing after a few days. Evidently the Core i7 chip in the MacBook Air is only a TWO CORE CHIP. I didn't even realize Intel made a 2 core Core i7. Nice marketing trick on Apple's part.\n\nBack to the MB Pro.\n\nMy setup. MB Pro 2.5GHz, 256GB storage, 16GB memory, 2 thunderbolt displays, magic mouse, wireless keyboard.\nTotal cost? $4500.00.\n\nFelt excited to be getting a new premier piece from Apple even though I've been on PC my whole life. So impressed with my iPhone 4S and 6 plus that was guardedly very optimistic. What a disappointment.\n\nWhat prompted me to finally review? My track pad just failed right at the 1 year mark. Call our outsource tech support and he said it's a VERY common failure on these units. Can either build a whole new machine and ship it to me, or send mine back for days while it's worked on. Relying only on mouse while i consider how much disruption i can handle in my business.\n\nCall apple care about it and they tell me it's something that could be fixed in a couple of hours on site and to just make a genius bar appointment. Make the appointment for 5 pm on a Friday, hire a baby sitter (closest apple store is 40 minutes away) and decide to make an evening of it; drop machine, grab dinner, maybe even a show, pick up machine before 9. problem solved.\n\nWould that it were that easy. End up in a traffic jam and will inevitably be late. Call the store to let them know we are running late, they say that we basically are giving up our appointment and will be considered a walk in. Awesome. Get to the store and they get us in queue. Mercifully we are up to the counter in no more than 5 minutes.\n\nGet to the Mac Genius, an extremely sympathetic and knowledgable soul, who says that regrettably they have to order the parts, they never carry then in store and that it's a 3-5 business day wait. Given that i was on a trip out of town the following Tuesday that would require use of my laptop, not a viable option. Not only that, to replace the track pad you have to replace the entire \"top case\" of the keyboard part of the unit meaning that I will get all new; trackpad, top case enclosure, speakers, keyboard, and battery. What? just to replace the trackpad? I've worked on laptops plenty and that is extraordinarily poor design from a maintenance standpoint.  That's akin to saying that the starter went out on your BMW, and they are going to have to replace the car from the windshield forward. Awesome.\n\nThe genius did call the store closest to where I would be staying and said I could bring it in there and they would order the parts and it should only be a one day wait. Still not viable, but I appreciated the effort. He also said this was the 7th apple care bad advice disaster of the evening.\n\nSo, out the store we went to ponder our options.\n\nI'm going to have our integrator order me an all new machine, transfer everything over and send this one back.\n\nSo my question is, what am i paying $2500 for if something as established as a trackpad is going to fail after a year and require a virtual overhaul of the machine? is it the accurate support information i receive from apple care? not so much.\n\nNow the machine has started staying on when i close the lid and draining the battery. Awesome.\n\nAnd finally and surprisingly, the keys on the keyboard leave visible marring on the screen. Really? Such fantastic design from a closed ecosystem.\n\nI have heard so much hype about 1) the Mac Ecosystem and 2) the incredible quality of the hardware. Not my experience at all.\n\nThe machine I moved from was a plastic case Dell with a core i5 and 8 GB of ram that I picked up for $379. I dropped a $100 SSD in it and that thing positive smokes this macbook for speed. Outlook never bogs it down nor does anything else for that matter. My MB Pro with a hotter chip and double the memory however has the fans spinning up all the time to handle the work load. If you have a large Outlook mailbox, good luck on the MB Air. Outlook makes it slow? Really? Shouldn't that be Photoshop or something....  Shouldn't something that costs 6 times as much do just a little better than that?\n\nAnd a word on the OS. OSX sucks. plain and simple. programs hang up all the time. Using Apple's own Keynote gets the spinning wheel all the time. Ironically our marketing lead uses a 2013 Mac Pro with Xeon processors, 32 GB of memory. She says she gets the spinning wheel ALL THE TIME. It has a force quit feature for programs. If the OS was so stable and amazing, why would you need easy access to a force quit option? Trust me, you'll need it. Frequently.\n\nAnd if you're using this for work, good luck. A huge array of enterprise applications simply don't integrate very well with OSX, or don't integrate at all. Migrating to Mac meant using Office for the Mac (2-3 years behind the PC Office dev curve), lose Lync altogether (amazing, amazing program), gotomeeting sucks on it, safari doesn't integrate with our CRM, the list goes on and on.\n\nThere are some cool features that you won't find in a pc to be sure; scroll on a non active window, the 2 and 3 finger gestures on the trackpad, swiping on the magic mouse, etc. And the hardware is sexy and well sorted. Ports grouped together, fit&finish, aluminum, etc.\n\nBut the feature coolness ends there. The magic mouse is sized for a toddle (i'm 6' 3\" with huge hands. It feels like i'm navigating with a nearly depleted bar of soap.), there is no wireless keyboard option with a key pad, only a wired option. really? The wireless trackpad sucks to high heaven. The magic mouse continually loses connectivity across every magic mouse. My logitech optical mouse that i'm using as backup works flawlessly every time. 4 years old. perfect. rechargable battery even. Better have air conditioning (we do) because the Thunderbolt displays feel like heaters on your desk.\n\nAs a company, we have had to rebuild machine after machine after machine as the hardware and OS fail.\n\nGetting this machine wasn't my decision and if it was, i would send it all back, by all new PC equipment with a robust support package, and bank thousands of dollars in savings and much more in lost productivity.\n\nNote: I am not an Apple hater. I have an iPhone that I love and an Apple Watch that I strongly like.\n\nPros: Attractive, solid fit and finish, sexy backlit keyboard, retina display, fit in at Starbucks, lets anyone who walks in your office know that you're the man, Impress everyone else sitting at a coffee shop that isn't Starbucks.\n\nCons: hardware reliability, extreme cost (at least 4 times too expensive), applecare not competent (pushes most issues on the store so better be close to one unless you want to be without your machine for weeks at a time), integration with enterprise applications, keyboard mars the screen (?!?), impossible for any but the most sophisticated user to work on and voids the warranty anyway, magic mouse not so magic, not nearly as fast as hardware would indicate.\n\nFinal note: hats off to the team at the Spokane Apple Store. They were genuinely concerned and did their best to address my issues. They even called to follow up to see how things ended. Apple Care didn't bother."}

This laptop  lasts about 6 to 8 hours on average. When its about to die it gives 3 notifications to charge it, one at 20%, 15%, and 10%. This gives you enough time to charge it.\nUser friendly: For many people laptops are very intimadating because they don't know how to operate them but this laptop is very simple to operate. If you are familar with any apple products learning how to use this laptop will come with ease. If you  still have troubles learning to use the laptop you can just call apple support with any questions you have regarding this laptop.\n\nEasy with Schooling: I am a student in college and I literally use this laptop for almost every homework assignment I have. The apps that come with this computer are very helpful with a wide range of class, if you are taking a video making class iMovie is excellent app that can help you edit and cut video scenes that are unwanted, photography is another class that this laptop would be very good for like editing pictures, and for me business class is super easy with this laptop because of all the current events i have to give with the Stockmarket.\n\nEntertainment: if you every get bored this laptop come in clutch! There are endless amount of games you could play on here whether it be through the internet or with the apps that the laptop come with. Also its very compatible with iTunes witch gives you endless amount of music you can play with tons of different genres to choose from. This laptop for me is the perfect gadget to play my Netflix on i could spend endless amount of hours using this laptop."}

So I decided to use some of my Christmas money to buy myself this one, and so far this is pretty awesome!  It's a different computer overall due to the way you control certain things and what not, but that hasn't been a big deal.\n\nI really like how it isn't bulky.  I also like the display.  I'm not an expert in measuring the quality of computer displays, but so far the details seem to be showing clearly, if that makes sense.  The speakers on this model are really nice as well.  It's also awesome how the charger for this computer is magnetic; my last computer's charger started getting bent out of shape, so thankfully I don't have to worry about that with this one.\n\nThe only thing is that I wish this had a CD drive, but that isn't a big deal.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00UGBMRQ8", "review": "Let me preface this with the fact that my boyfriend gave me this computer, as I wouldn't be able to afford over $1,000 for a Macbook on its own. That being said, I don't think I could ever go back to Windows after having this computer. The speed, the simplicity, the beautiful screen... it's all neatly wrapped into one extremely polished package. I'll lay out the pros and cons for my personal use:\n\nPros:\n-Fast. This thing boots up in about a minute, and from then on it's ready to go. Open the lid and you're greeted with your login screen instantly. It reminds me of my Chromebook, which I always praised for letting you get straight to work upon opening the lid. Apps open quickly, and switching between them is effortless and without a hiccup. Which brings me to my second pro;\n-Gesture based touchpad. It's very similar to an iPad. Three finger swipe between apps, two finger scroll, pinch to zoom- it's all here. It feels natural. And it makes navigation a breeze. It's light years ahead of windows computers, and I have to say that it makes it difficult to go back to a PC and navigate.\n-Battery. The Macbook Pro is rated at about 8 hours of constant use, and I'd say I get about that. Although I never have used it for 8 hours in a row, it lasts about a day or 2 of mixed usage, depending on what I'm doing. Obviously if I'm playing WoW (which it runs fun on medium settings), the battery will run out in about 3 hours. But mixed web browsing gives me around 7-8, which is impressive for a laptop this powerful. And the magsafe cable prevents accidental falls, which I appreciate.\n-Keyboard. The backlit keys are easy to see, and give a nice tactile \"click\" when pressed. Writing is fast and I make few errors. I love this keyboard.\n-Screen, screen, screen! The retina display is simply gorgeous. Viewing angles are fantastic, color reproduction is accurate, and everything looks very crisp and clean. Another reason why it's tough to go back to my basic 1366x768 windows and Chromebook displays.\n-Portability. With Apple's decision to remove the disc drive, the Macbook Pro has gotten pretty slim and lightweight. I can easily pack it in my backpack and slide it out when I need it. It doesn't break my back like my old fat HP, and it still retains 90% of the function. If you really want a disc drive, you can buy a slim external Samsung for about $30 here on amazon. I personally like this tradeoff.\n-OS X El Capitan. This operating system has me enamored. It's so beautiful, clean, highly polished, and full of potential. If I can't find something (being a new Mac user), I can almost always find it from the Spotlight Search. The user experience is the most important thing in a computer, and I think that OS X has every other OS beaten in terms of usability, style, simplicity, and capability.\n\nCons:\n-Speakers. They're just... not good. They're tinny, they have zero bass, and they don't get particularly loud. My $150 Acer Chromebook 720 absolutely murders the Macbook on sound quality. I was hoping for more from a $1300 computer.\n-Webcam. It's just so-so. With all the focus Apple put on \"Facetime HD\" cameras on iPhones, you'd think that they'd bump up the resolution and quality of the webcam. But it remains useable. Just invest in an external HD cam if you plan on recording for youtube, blogging, etc.\n-Ports. Who uses thunderbolt? Coming from a PC, I would like at least 3 USB 3.0 ports on a laptop. This has 2, which is sufficient, but I can't help wanting a 3rd instead of having 2 thunderbolt ports. An ethernet jack would have been nice, too. But we all know Apple likes their minimalism (The 2015 Macbook has 1 singular port for everything), so I'll take what I can get. Data transfer speeds are still good, and it juices my iPhone up at a relatively brisk 1.1 amps.\n-Price. And this is the main defining factor in getting a Mac. You can almost always find a Windows PC in the same price range with better technical specifications. However, you're not paying just for specs, you're paying for the experience. OS X is much different than Windows, and in my opinion, more fun and engaging. Does that justify the price? On its own, no. But combined with every other pro, I think it does.\n\nThe Macbook Pro Retina overall is a pleasure to use. Things feel natural, fluid, and connected. Much like using an iPhone or iPad, everything feels polished. Sure, there are some hiccups here and there, but they're few and far in between compared to how many times I've had to deal with \"(insert program here) is not responding. End now?\" only to have the program hang there for another few minutes. Just know that specs aren't everything, and you should head down to your local Best Buy to try a Mac out before making the jump. Feel it out, see how you like it, and give it a chance. You won't be disappointed."}

Sorely disappointed.  Yes, one can pay even 20% more for the computer and add AppleCare to the cost to extend the warrantee period, but the price point being what it is, wouldn't you think Apple would (a) use especially high quality components to start and (b) warrantee them for more than 12 months? Despite the repair costs, the down-time associated with losing the use of the computer is costly in a number of other ways. The impact of poor reliability is indeed very high.\n\nIf known ahead of time, we would have not purchased this machine.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00UGBMRQ8", "review": "I bought this laptop after several PC laptop failures. I have been nothing but happy with this product. I love that it isn't heavy, but I get the benefits of memory and speed with the Pro. The retina display is awesome, and I am really enjoying the capabilities of the laptop. Things work seamlessly and easy and the laptop syncs with my other devices well (mostly apple products). It is easy to find cases and other products for this computer because it is a commonly purchased model. At first, I thought I might miss the touch screen of my previous PC (which died), but the apple trackpad makes zooming in, clicking fast, and navigating around your screen smooth once you learn the gestures. It doesn't take long to learn and it becomes intuitive. Honestly, touch screen laptops always get dirty and smudged even with the screen protector and have other glitches, so I prefer the crisp, clear-screened, seamless, process of apple laptops.\n\nPros:\n- Charges quickly\n- The battery lasts a long time, even when screen is on bright setting (the bright setting is obnoxiously bright and only necessary if gaming/watching some movies)\n- It is light-weight. Obviously not as light weight as the MacBook Air but not much heavier than the Air at all.\nfast start-up\n- It handles multiple running programs simultaneously without getting slow or freezing. THIS is why I LOVE the Pro!!\n- It syncs to multiple devices easily. For example, I barely even need to use the start up discs, it just syncs seamlessly\n- The computer has nice speakers. Good sound quality and decently loud. They are not so loud they sound like they are blaring, but why would someone need all that from a laptop? And if you do, connect the laptop to a more powerful sound device :)\n- The great picture quality is hands-down incredible. You can really see the difference.\n- This laptop is easy to accessorize\n\nCons:\n- The price... but you get what you pay for and this was worth every penny"}

Not only did I buy this computer once and had a start-up issue, but when I exchanged it, I had the same issue for both!\n\nI, like some others, was stuck on the \"Setting up Your Mac..\" screen right when I tried to set the computer up, so I tried to reboot it and a circle with a line through it was displayed on my computer. I called Apple, and they basically told me that my hard drive was corrupt and I should return the computer. (Great.)\n\nSo I exchanged this laptop for the same model, and when I went to set it up, AGAIN, I was shown the \"Setting up your Mac\" screen for another three hours. I called Apple to see what the problem was because I didn't want to \"screw it up\" again or even touch my computer for that matter. I thought maybe it was something with my Internet connection, but my WiFi is fine, and my laptop was nearly on top of the router. The Apple specialist on the phone told me the only fix for my \"slow set-up\" was to plug an ethernet cord into the laptop and connect directly to my router. (Then he told me the MacBook pro actually doesn't have an ethernet port but a 'Thunder Bolt' port?)\n\nWhen I asked if this was normal to take hours to set up, to their admittance, they told me, \"No.\" It may have been because I entered in my iCloud username, but my screen was frozen like this, nonetheless.\n\nThe Apple specialist told me to reboot the computer, and from there I was shown a screen with a circle and a line through it (again). Transferring me to a senior associate who luckily guided me, I had to, then, erase MacIntosh HD and then re-install the OS for a total of another two hours. FINALLY the actual set-up process took a mere five minutes after that! Not to mention, I only figured all of this out because I talked with one of the senior associates. (Even so, we had to go through about five different techniques to even remotely solve the problem.)\n\nMy computer is fine now, and I love it, but seriously? For spending $1200 plus tax, I shouldn't have to spend nine hours trying to set up my computer. Not to mention, I could have done the same thing I did to the first computer because the second computer had the EXACT same issue.\n\nI'm terrified to install any other updates after this! I'm not sure whether the Yosemite OS was the problem, but come on, Apple, I could have spent a fraction of the price for a computer that actually WORKED. Loved spending my weekend trying to set this computer up."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00UGBMRQ8", "review": "Let me preface this by saying that I'm 27 and up until a few months ago, have never owned a Mac, other than for a few months as a work computer.  I've owned around 5 or 6 PC laptops.\n\nI was recently in the market for a new laptop again, as my Dell had gone kaput.  I wanted to get a MBP, but it was too expensive.  So I got a Dell...and returned it 3 days later.  It was big, clunky, and laggy.  I got an ASUS, returned in 2 days later.  Same problems, and it just didn't feel nice.\n\nFinally, I decided...screw it.  Yes, it's more expensive.  But this is my primary tool to make a living (I work for myself), and my primary tool for entertainment.  I ponied up about $500 more than I was initially willing to spend and bought this computer.\n\nI've owned this puppy for 2 months folks, and let me tell you, it has been the best purchase of my life.  Not for one second, do I regret this.\n\nWhy?\n\nIt does not hang.  It does not crash.  It does not lag.  It does not stutter, even for a millisecond.  When I insert an HDMI cable, it instantly splits the display between two screens.  No lag time.  When I remove the HDMI cable, it moves the display back to one screen.  No lag time.  No crashes.\n\nWant to open Photoshop, Excel, Garage Band, Quicktime, iTunes, Chrome, Steam, Skype, and Spotify at the same time?  Please do.  Aside from Photoshop and Garage Band (which take about 6 and 4 seconds respectively to open), everything else opens instantly.  Want to switch between Photoshop and iTunes, then back to Excel, then to Spotify?  You can do it, instantly, with the swipe of  two finger.  No lag.  No delays.\n\nAs hard as I try, as much as I do, I cannot get this darn machine to even sputter, lag, stutter, or trip.  For even a millisecond.  Everything is silky, buttery, smooth.\n\nUsing the computer is an absolute joy.  I'd compare it to driving a luxury vehicle.  It's an \"experience\" more so than just a machine.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the trackpad.  I've never used anything like it.  The trackpads on PC laptops are absolute garbage compared to this beauty.  Half the time I'm using this thing with my USB mouse plugged in, I forget to use the mouse, and 2 hours later, I notice that I've been using the trackpad the whole time!\n\nBecause of the disgustingly quick SSD...boot up and shutdown takes about 10 seconds.  Going to sleep and waking it up is instantaneous.  At night, I put this thing to sleep by closing the screen. I wake up in the morning, open my screen, and my computer instantly powers on (I don't even have to press a button).  It's beautiful, and such an amazing departure from a 45 second Windows boot screen.\n\nAnd battery life?  Over 10 hours.  It's freaking insane.\n\nFolks, let me put it this way.  Can you get a computer with the same \"Specs\" for 400 less?  I'm sure you could, just like you can get a car with the same \"specs\" as a BMW for $25,000.\n\nDo these computers even come close to matching the experience of a Mac?  Absolutely not even close.  If you want a computer that just WORKS, that will never lag, that will never stutter, that will never hang, and that is designed for maximum usability and convenience for the user, I highly suggest this computer."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00UGBMRQ8", "review": "Bought the 13\" i5 with the 256GB SSD. Have been using the Dell XPS 13 i5 256GB that came out at the same time as this model since March and have been using this MBP for over two weeks straight now, so it is not a completely fair comparison. I have traditionally been a PC user, but did have a late 2007 white macbook from '07 to '10 and it was my main computer during that time. Then it was work-issued latitudes and think pads for a while until I picked up the XPS13 and now the early 2015 13\" MBP.\nI think the MBP ticks off more of the nice-to-have boxes for me than the XPS13 overall. They are both really nice machines.\n1. The XPS13 runs cooler on the lap than the MBP, which is really nice in the evenings. Not a huge deal as I usually have them on a desk. The MBP does not run as hot as my old white MB did.\n2. The battery life is really pretty comparable (slightly more with the MBP, and I can obtain info on app energy usage a bit easier IMO).\n3. The keyboards are both nice to type on. I prefer the XPS as I make less errors on it, and the rubberized palm rest area is really nice and more comfy than the aluminum. The backlighting is comparable, but the MBP gets brighter.\n4. The processors are comparable, and Adobe premiere elements (my test case) works admirably with either. The SSD is smoking fast in the MBP and it is noticeable with larger file transfers.\n5. The speakers are better on the XPS IMO, but who really wants to listen to stuff for very long through laptop speakers.\n6.  The thunderbolt ports are a nice thing to have on the MBP, and I feel are more versatile than the ports on the XPS. No HDMI on the XPS, which is not an issue for me, but may be for some.\n7. Oh the displays, they each get it partially right, but I'd pick the MBP over the XPS. The MBP display brighter, and the the IPS is sooo nice compared to the XPS (I have the FHD version). I prefer the display aspect ratio on the XPS (shorter, wider) than the MBP, especially when you have side-by-side windows like I often do. The bezel on the XPS is non existent, which is nice, but honestly not that big a deal. I kind of like the black trim around the MBP which adds a buffer between the screen and any distracting background images/colors.\n8. The trackpad is the ultimate difference-maker for me. I tried really hard to like the XPS trackpad, and it is indeed the best trackpad on a PC that I've had. But the touch and move delay and lower sensitivity is an issue. The MBP trackpad is best in class and if you are not using a mouse, this makes a huge difference. I don't care for the deep click force touch, but love the lack of a hinge which means I can press anywhere with the same pressure to register a click. And I can make the force required to register a click lighter or firmer. Just love it.\n9. The XPS is lighter and smaller and a pleasure to carry around. The weight difference is noticeable, but I don't travel, and I remember the old bricks I had in the late 90s, early 00s that make these two seem like feathers. So weight is not a huge issue for me. The MBP 13\" is plenty mobile.\n10. I won't get into OS and software in too much detail, but the #1 thing for me is the ability of the Mac OS to properly scale applications for the retina screen. This is still an issue in Windows 10 (I've been using Win10 for 4 months on the XPS) and extremely frustrating to see blurry images/text/windows on a high DPI screen. I really like what MS has done with Win10, and would prefer it slightly over OS X El Capitan if it weren't for the scaling thing (which in Windows is more dependent on the app developers more so than in Mac OS from what I understand). I have Office 2016 on the MBP and it not as nice as Office in Win10, but getting really close. The one drawback is that it uses more energy than most apps on the MBP (especially Word, not so much with Excel or PPT), so I've been using Google Docs/Drive in Safari (Chrome is also an energy hog) if I'm away from a power source and the task is light enough. Adobe apps are also power hogs, but that is to be expected. I like the Adobe apps better in Mac OS than in Win10. I think the design in Win10 is flatter and more appealing, but that is personal preference. I also feel like Apple hides too much under the hood from the user, but I suppose you can still work around that if you are so inclined.\n11. An unexpected benefit for me has been the iPhone/MBP integration. I love the airdrop and receiving iMessages on my MBP (although it can cut into productivity if you're not careful).\nOverall, it's a great machine and I prefer it over the XPS13. It'll be interesting to see what the revisions are in 2016, but I was worried about the shallow keys of the new macbook making their way to the MBP and the loss of port options with a new revision, so I am very happy to have this now.\nApple has come along way since the old Macintosh SE I used in junior high around 1990, haha."}

Well worth paying the extra money for something fast, stable and reliable. The learning curve from coming from windows is not as big as most folks think it is. If anyone has any problems, a quick google search will usually resolve your issues. I get several hours from single battery use easily getting me through the day. When the time comes to get a new computer Apple is likely to get a repeat customer assuming they do not raise the prices on the Macs like they did the IPad this year which is why I have decided on a new computer instead of a tablet. The only real complaint I have for the Macbook is that I cannot seem to figure out how to watch amazon prime video online with it."}

I bought this for my fianc and she is in love. The screen quality is second to none and the battery life seems to be pretty good. I like the backlit keyboard on this model as well. It's a plus when you are in a dark room or using it at night. I am a power user so when I was running it I was running 3 or 4 applications and tabbing between them seamlessly.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00UGBMRQ8", "review": "THIS WAS MY VERY FIRST MAC ... I have been a PC user all my life and had wanted to try converting to a Mac for years.  I've only had this Apple Macbook Pro for a week, but let me tell you that on day one I fell in love with it.  Yes, it does have a different feel from the PCs I have had (HP, Toshiba, Acer), but it was a good difference from the first time I put my fingers to the keyboard and began typing.  The screen display is absolutely amazing and totally blows me away.  I absolutely love the programs that come with it; how the Mac itself functions, the appearance and quality of the Mac.  Everything about it is pure joy and I am 100% delighted with my purchase.  As far as the Mac vs. PC debate - by day two I was sold out to Macs.  While I had been use to a 17-inch screen display, the 13.3-inch screen display of this Mac took zero time to get use to ... plenty big enough for work and play purposes (and did I mention the dynamic awesome graphic display???).\n\nThe laptop is still new to me and I'm still discovering things about it daily, so give me a little more time with it and I'll come back to update this review, pros as well as any cons I discover.  At the present the only cons are:\n\n1.) having to use the arrow keys to move up and down pages, as the slide on the right side bar (to hold the curser over and move up and down) doesn't stay up when I move the curser to it - but that may be something I am doing wrong, as I'm still learning the intimacies of the Mac. (Case in point ... a day after writing this, I discovered that moving two fingers together up or down on the touch pad will move the page up / down quite nicely.  lol.)\n\n 2.) battery life thus far isn't nearly as long as I thought it would be, based upon video reviews of this model and item description.  Working on documents, etc. battery life is great,.  However, playing the two games I enjoy on Facebook (Criminal Case and CSI) with some surfing the web in between will drain the fully-charged battery down to 20% in just 2 hours.  Playing the games some with more time spent surfing the web, etc. drains the battery from fully charged to 43% in 3 hours.  Will battery life stretch with use?  I don't know.  Would battery life be extended if the games were on the laptop itself instead of online at a web site?  I'm not sure, but think perhaps ...\n\nLet me add, the vender DataVision Computer Video gives exceptional service.  After placing my order for the MacBook Air and discovering that I would be unable to upgrade the RAM, I sent in a cancellation request that was handled by 'Mike S.'  Mike politely cancelled my order no problem, and when I placed an order for this Macbook Pro the very next day, he handled it personally and got it in the mail the same day, even though I didn't request it or pay extra for speedy delivery.  When the Mac arrived it was VERY adequately and securely packaged; I was very pleased. NOTE: hubby and I don't have a a lot of extra money to indulge in extras, after bills and living expenses, so a purchase like this is something really big for us and we try and chose wisely.  Not only am I more delighted with the MacBook Pro than I hoped to be, but hubby is so impressed with it that HE wants to convert from his PC to a Mac, as soon as we can swing it.\n\nJANUARY 21, 2016 UPDATE:  I love this laptop even more than before.  Feel totally comfortable with it, and will never go back to a PC.\n\nJUNE 19, 2016 UPDATE: the love story continues.  This MacBook is such a blessing and I would feel somewhat lost without it.  If you're considering getting this MacBook, proceed with confidence.  It has been super easy to become familiar with it; the more I use it, the more I appreciate it!\n\nPERSONAL MESSAGE\nI paid full price for Macbook Pro; I DID NOT get it at a discounted price in exchange for an evaluation.  So, why did I take the time to write a detailed review?  Because I am like you  I depend upon the comments and experiences of other consumers when making an Amazon purchasing decision - especially an important one, such as this.\n\nEven when I do provide a review in exchange for a free or discounted product, I don't feel obliged to write a positive one, just an honest and fair one.  Also, when reviewing products upon request I do not always rate a product 5 stars, or even 4 stars.

The MacBook pro offers a very dependable machine that will muddle-through anything you throw at it without complaining. It is a timeless design and a very respectable screen. Yet, as of Nov 28, I think both the newest Dell XPS 13 and Surface Pro 4 offer more interesting alternatives and both have been updated to the 6th Gen Intel's chip and offer comparable if not better screens and performance. of course, surface pro 4 keyboard is inferior, but the touch screen/surface pen combo, more than compensates the weakness if you ask me.\n\nI think Apple is facing the quite interesting dilemma whether to join the crowd and offer touch screen and/or Apple Pen in their next Macbook pro line or stay on the split personality type of business lines. it brings to memory how blackberry refused to embrace people did more than just write email on their phones and fell behind iPhones; apple might be on blackberry's position right now in the laptop world.\n\nto summarize; if you buy now, you will clearly enjoy the laptop specially if you don't look around at your friends or colleagues newer laptops. but if you can wait a few months, I am sure it will be worth it."}

It takes about 5 second to rewake when its sleeping (which is weird). If you don't have the charger in, it will go to sleep when you close the lid. If the charger is in, when you close the lid it will just go into standby and immediately resume when you open the lid.\n\n-Screen\n---The retina display is one of my favorite thing about this macbook. Its very beautiful. If you try to use a laptop without PPI after using this you will feel anger. The display has some major problems however. Apple has addressed the problem with the clear coat coming off of the screen. This is a huge problem affecting many users. However, they will replace it for free even if your macbook is out of warranty. My freind has had to get his screen replace 3 times! All for free however.\n\n-Battery life\n--- When you first get this computer will you will get on average about 7 hours of battery out of this. If you are only surfing or typing up papers then you will get about 9 hours. After the first 2 months, you will start to notice the battery is dying fast and fast each time. After one year, I have notice that I can only get 4 hours out of my laptop before it dies. So after 6 months, bring your charger around with you.\n\n-Opening apps is a breeze, things open up within 2 seconds. Takes to the SSD and PCIE SSD.\n---Most apps such as safari, mail, word and other daily applications most people use open up nearly immediately due to some of the software being dump on the ram. If you use a application frequently enough, it will keep the application in the ram and open nearly instantly. In the new OS X, there are a few problems, currently in 10.11, the laptop lags a bit sometimes. It has crashed on my under heavy usage more than 6 times in the last month. Causing em to lose important docs. This shouldn't be a problem in the future and I will update when/if they fix the problem.\n\n-Doesn't run very hot when in your lap.\n--- I am able to keep this in my lap and watch videos and stream movies and surf the internet without it getting burning hot. However, more demanding applications will get this laptop hot (70-90 degrees fahrenheit). You can also control the fan speed with 3rd party application easily.\n\n-OS X UI is clean, things are all over the place and things are easy to find.\n---Everything is organized and neat. No need to go wandering around all over the place. Your bluetooth and wifi settings are where you think they will be and everything is self explanatory\n\n-Beautiful looks, silver on black is nice. (Gray on black would be better tho)\n---The macbook's design hasn't changed much for nearly 10 years. If it's not broken don't fix it. However, if they can add color options to the pro line that would be awesome.\n\n-Multitasking on a mac is very simple.\n---I nearly run over 30 tabs all at once with mail open, word, photos, itunes, skype and messages open and I am only using 12 GB of the 16 available. That's good memory management.\n\n- Warranty\n---Apple stands by there products and you will have this product under warranty for  a year for free. This will come in handy because you WILL need to get work done of this computer. After the first 8 months, the fans will start making humming noises and the laptop will get hot.\n\n-Trackpad and keyboard\n---The trackpad is great for multi gestures. However, it can be better, you will need a mouse if you are doing anything heavy on this computer because of the trackpad setup. The keyboard is one of my favorite and it's very easy to clean and maintain. The typing experience is nearly perfect and key travel is spot on.\n\n-Portably\n--- 4.5 pounds doesn't sound like much until it's hanging off your shoulder for an hour. It's not the lightest laptop but it's not the heaviest. But you aren't buying a pro for it's weight.\n\n-Ports\n--- It does well with ports, why is there no 3.5 input port? Some users will have to buy a separate device for their needs but they could have fitted that. It does include an SD card port which is nice. 2 USB 3.0 and HDMI 1.0 and two thunderbolt 2.0 ports.\n\n-Facetime camera\n--- 720p camera on a 2000 computer is disgusting. But the camera does it's job well. Video chat will be clear. You will always know when the camera is on with the green led that is connected to the camera's voltage input line. Which means it can't be hacked to turn off, it is hardwired to the camera.\n\n-Connections\n-- You will definitely get your network's full bandwidth on this computer. It has 802.11 AC and is backwards compatible with other standards. Bluetooth 4.0 does the good perfectly. However, there is sometimes a problem trying to connect bluetooth earphones to this computer. After about 5 times of turning bluetooth on and off it connects, maybe just my earphones."}

Although it's not much heavier than the MacBook Air in spec, but it feels significantly heavier.  However, I have to remove one star for the very unreliable magnetic charging connector. I used to have an older MacBook Air, in which the charging line comes 90 degree to the connector. It's much more reliable and not easily fall off."}

Great buy.ly\n\nAs for the Macbook itself, this is my very first Apple product. As a life-long Windows user, I finally know what a truly hassle-free computer is like. Everything about it \"just works\". Never going back to Windows again if I don't have to. It's also super fast for the most power-intensive stuff I do (hi-def video). I just wish it had an ethernet port, but I guess that's the direction mobile computing is going these days.\n\nThe thing is also built beautifully. It has a \"luxurious\" feel, construction and look that pretty much no non-Apple laptop has, like going from a Chevy, or in some cases a Kia, to a Lexus. Even the way the screen lifts and the feel of it closing is really nice, like the shutting of a Lexus door compared to that of an old 97 Chevy Cavalier.\n\nBa-da-bah-bah-bahh, I'm lovin it."}

So apparently if there is even so much as an accidental eyelash on your dock, the delicate tissue paper screen cracks and you need to pay $800 to get it fixed at the 'genius bar'.  Either that or maybe there is an issue with the fragile new retina screens.  I  had an old white Mac for 8 years.  Best computer ever.  This new design is nothing but a nightmare!  You were warned."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00UGBMRQ8", "review": "I can not say enough good things about this 15\" MacBook Pro. It is an AMAZING computer. Despite being in IT I have never owned a Mac and considered them sort of an \"overpriced cult product\". I only bought this because I need to develop an iOS app and X Code is only available for Mac, and I opted for top of the line on the assumption that \"Im only going to buy one\" so I might as well buy one that lasts for years.  Was I ever wrong! After spending the weekend setting this up and using it, I am going \"full Apple\" and now plan to replace my desktop with an iMac. I should have made the switch years ago!\n\nFirst of all. This computer is FAST. Lightning fast. I can't believe how fast. It can't be explained away by the system specs as I have used i7 chips with 16GB of RAM before. I have used SSD drives before, and computers running Windoze are just never this fast, OS X is a FANTASTIC operating system. Incredibly user friendly, and extremely low overhead. I have been deliberately running multiple high resource things and haven't broken 12% on the activity monitor. This has power to spare.  Click an attachment and it opens instantly no spinning, no circling, no thinking about it. Poof its there.\n\nThe quality is amazing. The case is aluminum, and there is no detectable noise when the computer is running. It boots in seconds. The display is better than my HDTV. The keyboard has a good feel and backlit keys, the \"Force Touch Trackpad\" takes a little getting used to because of muscle memory and habits from the HP / Windows world I came from but it is vastly superior and I know I will love it once I unlearn old habits. This is  what a notebook computer should be.\n\nAs for transitioning to the Mac environment, I found it both easy and intuitive. I expected to spend all of next week trying to set it up and figure it out, but that was not the case. I was up and running in two evenings, and back to actual productive work on the second evening. If your a casual user it will take you even less time as that included installing several browsers, MAMP, Eclipse IDE, NetBeans IDE, Android Studio, X-Code, Java Development Kit, MySQL Workbench, Joomla, Drupal, and Wordpress installations, multiple printers, a couple of VPNs, multiple email accounts, and a ton of other things that the casual user will not need to do.  The non-IT / non-Developer user probably won't need to install anything and should be up and running within an hour of opening the box.  The apps that come factory installed are great. If you are used to Windows, you are used to new computers being packed full of useless crap, semi-functional watered down versions, and trials. Thats not the case in Mac. Pages, Numbers, and Keynote are in my opinion superior to Word, Excel, and Powerpoint and they will open and save as the MS Office formats if you ned to. (They will also save as PDFs). I would say Pages is actually functionally equivalent to Word and Publisher rolled into one. Its Word Processing and Desktop Publishing functionality combined. The Mail, Contacts, and Calendar apps are in my opinion better than Outlook and far more intuitive to use. Finder is like Windows Explorer / Windows File manager and should be an easy transition. Safari is a great web browser, Maps is super useful, and iMovie, Photos, and Garage Band take care of your multimedia creation and editing needs - though a professional artist or video editor will no doubt want something higher end. But if an ordinary user looking to edit videos for YouTube or home movies, or to edit photos for web pages or blogs, this machine will be off and running out of the box. The Mac lets you work without spending a fortune on a productivity office suite, and buying all kinds of specialty programs.\n\nI have absolutely nothing negative to say about this particular computer, or Mac in general. It was a fast, easy, and smooth transition and the product is physically superior to any Windows computer I have ever used. Apple's attention to detail is amazing right down to the magnetic power cord connector. The battery life is phenomenal - you can work all day. The Retina display is better than a plasma TV. The interface and user experience is  amazingly well thought out and very intuitive. It seems apple spared no detail. They even have your weather, a world clock, a calculator and a calendar on the desktop. (with options for more things like ski reports, stock prices, ski reports etc) The are several gestures on the trackpad that are extremely handy. For example 4 fingers swiped up displays all open windows tiled on the screen. The machine came with OS X Yosemite, and the app store offered a free one click upgrade to OS X El Capitan which took only minutes to do. They also provided a free iBook (like Apples version of Kindle) uses manual.\n\nIn the interest of full disclosure - the hard drives in these, while blazing fast, are fairly small by modern standards. HOWEVER, keep in mind that you have iCloud storage, and an external hard drive is quite inexpensive. (I bought a 1TB Western Digital here on Amazon for less than $50 and the machine has plenty of ports including firewire and usb 3.0) With all the developer tools and apps I installed, including a 16G database project Im currently working on, I still have 198 GB free. My advice would be \"don't clutter up your drive\" with old junk. Use the internal hard drive for your apps and temporary storage of things your currently working on, and then move lesser used stuff and archival copies to iCloud, Dropbox, or some kind of external storage like a flash stick, external drive, or the Apple \"Airport Time Capsule\" which also does automatic backups. The hard drive size won't be a problem if your not a data hoarder.\n\nIn summation - buy this, and never look back. Its an expensive notebook, but its a fantastic notebook with blazing speed and fantastic quality and you will make the money back by increased productivity, reduced aggravation, and saving a fortune on buying software to do things OS X does right out of the box. I'm kicking myself for not having gotten one of these long ago, it would have made my life so much easier."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00UGBMRQ8", "review": "Having owned other apple laptops in the past I can say without a doubt this one is the best 13 inch they have made. It's exactly identical to the past model but with a little bit more powerful CPU and a faster SSD. It also includes the new force touch track pad, which is truly incredible. When pushing down on the track pad it gives a sensation that you are clicking it. This is because it is force-sensitive, there's a set of electromagnets that move enough to feel like there's a click happening. (No click is really happening.) For example if you were to try clicking down when the laptop was turned off, nothing would happen. But more on the laptop it handles everything from moderate use like browsing the web and watching youtube videos to doing music production and video editing. You shouldn't have a problem doing anything on this laptop, it's practically perfect. I do however recommend if you are looking for a laptop top for professional use, to check out the 15 inch model. Other then that you should be more than happy when you receive your new macbook pro! :)"}

The display is not necessarily designed for older eyes though, very tiny text due to the super high resolution.

I have been willing to pay a premium for their products (over twice as much as competitors) because they work, and when they don't they are fixed without hassle.  The latest computers, including these new MBPr plus the minis, are a step backwards.  They combine everything into a single board and solder it together-- MB, RAM, video, everything.  If one thing fails, it must all be replaced (who makes a computer that you can't even upgrade the RAM!?!?!).  And the cost of the repair translates to throwing it away and buying a new computer.\n\nI have a documented, known and recognized by Apple issue with my MBPr.  The video component of the MBPr was shipped defective from Apple from the start.  There is a special Apple repair program to resolve this.  But the issue is intermittent.  It may crash the computer (or show trash on the screen) for two days in a row, and then be fine for weeks.  They will not perform the repair until the intermittent problem appears in their shop.  After two days in their shop, surprise, it does not come up.  They refuse to fix my $2500 computer until THEY see it happen.  They don't trust their customers that the issue is there.  Like we would go through all this trouble for nothing.\n\nI have lost faith in Apple.  Time to delve back into the Windoze world again.  Maybe there is a manufacturer out there that still has decent customer service.  Apple doesn't any more.  And they aren't building them like they used too either."}

All elements of the laptop, from the OS, to the screen, to the body, keyboard, and fan, like a great symphony, come together to produce the experience so many hail. To compare the Mac to a car, its definitely a Rolls Royce, or Cadillac, or a high end Mercedes; not meant to be pushed too hard or taken cross country, but a driving experience that will make you fall in love with your daily routine once again.\n\nAt a glance:\n\nKeyboard is among the best if not the best I've ever used. As aesthetically pleasing as the laptop is, I can't complain about anything ergonomically. The tactile feedback is excellent whether you use a soft or harsh touch. The trackpad is a pleasure to use and I don't miss mouse buttons one bit. Once you get the gestures down, it feels quite natural. All surfaces have a wonderful texture to them. It really is a pleasure working on this machine and I find myself babying it as to prolong its new feel :). Its engineered as it was designed - to perfection. Nothing rattles, creaks slides or bends in this machine. The hinges seat the screen perfectly to the chassis and the action is butter smooth. Overall, this machine is a delicate flower... a far cry from the days of my ThinkPads.\n\nOS:\n\n Truly a symphony. Goodbye bloatware, popups, awkward designs schemas. Id hate to admit it, but OS X alone could justify the price premium.\n\nTaptic engine:\n Way cool how it simulates a mouse click both physically and acoustically. The gestures are great too.\n\nChasis:\n\n  Good. The material is light and solid which feels great when the laptop is docked on the desk or other surface, however,  the lack of ductility makes the machine rigid to the point I feel that Im stressing the laptop by picking it up single handedly, which is an annoyance. Also, because of apples narcissistic vanity, the clearance between the screen and the keyboard is nearly 0, so prepare to see smudges from the keys if you put any stress on the lid when its closed (ex. picking it up single handedly, being rugged with the laptop at all when its closed).\n\nCharger: What in the actual f**k is up with this charger. It falls out all the time and seems pretty cheap compared to the rest of the laptop. The wire is prone to crimping which means it will be prone to fraying somewhere down the line. Best re-enforce is with some duct tape or clear packing tape if you're into the whole aesthetic look.\n\nScreen:\n Makes the 1080p on my last high end laptop look like pixelated garbage :). The colors are superb. Retina all the way.\n\nPerformance:\n It would be nice to have skylake or even broadwell under the hood for what it retails for (I wouldn't pay retail or even close to it for this setup), 14nm vs 22 nm physical footprint should see about an hour increase in battery life yada yada, but for my purposes no significant difference other than the psychological win. This box uses the 4770HQ for the base model 15, which was put out only last year but is still based on 2013 tech. Again, not a biggie for consumer or moderate level users but probably deters pros since skylake is already being implemented in PCs like the surface pro.\n\nConclusion:\n\n If you want the Mac experience but can't see envision yourself using their dwarf sized 13'' laptop then this is the only option. Coming from PCs, I really cant justify the price you pay for the technology you get under the hood, but that seems to be compensated for by apples precision engineering and unparalleled build quality."}

The charger falls out all the time and it's extremely annoying. The charger from my old model had a hook like component to it that made the charger stay in the port."}

Someone put it under a pallet of bricks it survived no cracks. they also put a freaking boulder on it and it still survived even though the screen cracked only that time. It was showered in water thrown around by the same people and it was still a fuctioning laptop a day later. I love it. Really the only downside with this one in particular is 128gb. don't get me wrong PCIe is really fast but I'd rather have more GB's then fast ones. So if your a creative person like me I'd recommend you cough of $200 more for the 256GB version."}

I spent hundreds of hours trying to get basic functions to work on my wife's new laptop, and couldn't face that again when my 64-bit Vista HP Pavilion began to show signs of terminal illness. Starting up with this Mac was effortless - everything worked except the Windows migration utility, which couldn't possibly have been unit-tested before it shipped; it couldn't establish a socket connection to another host on the same subnet (4 lines of code in Python). Underneath the intuitive and beautiful GUI, there is a Unix core that didn't take long to figure out. The applications are not the usual iPhone trash that only exists to spy on your buying habits - they work perfectly and install effortlessly. The trackpad works almost too well; I have difficulty adjusting to the company computers every morning. My wife is mad with envy, but is afraid that Windows 10 will be even worse."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00UGBMRQ8", "review": "I bought a 15-inch MacBook Pro directly from Apple with their AppleDoesn'tCare protection, which does not cover accidental damage. The screen was damaged with very light pressure from a headphone, and, of course, this damage was not covered by the AppleDoesn'tCare warranty. I had purchased the laptop at a time when the Retina display was an upgrade option, and had purchased it with this option. When I asked the first AppleDoesn'tCare representative about the possibility of using a less expensive display for the repair, he insisted that no other displays were compatible with the laptop's configuration. When I asked another AppleDoesn'tCare representative how it was possible that the laptop could support an external display and have a Retina display as one of several options when it was born, yet only be compatible with a Retina display when it needed surgery, he finally admitted that I could have a third part do my repair with a different display, but that Apple was too blunt to allow such variations from the initial specifications. Also, for some reason, Apple could not keep track of the change in my original configuration if a different display were to be used, even if Apple did the repair. Really? Additionally, using a third party would void my AppleDoesn'tCare warranty. How convenient. As I saw that Apple was unwilling to allow any less expensive options, and I had already wasted enough time talking with a company that was too stupid to allow even the simplest variation to a computer as using a different output device (screen), I finally forked over the $1260 (63% of the purchase price or about the cost of 2.5 similar-sized laptops from Hewlett-Packard) that they insisted was the only way Apple new how to replace the screen. Damage repairs make this device almost prohibitive. It is no wonder that BestBuy cannot afford to offer GeekSquad protection for Apple laptops, but instead offers the AppleDoesn'tCare warranty. Take care of your laptop as AppleDoesn'tCare how much they charge to repair it. And now, let us all pray that our MacBook Pro screens do not crack. Ameen! (Amen!)."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00UGBMRQ8", "review": "So, this is not only a review of this Macbook Pro, but of my experience with MacBooks as a whole.\n\nMy first experience with Apple laptops was earlier in 2015 when I had a good bit of spare money & decided to try out a Macbook Air 13\".  I was coming off of a very reliable, high resolution PC I'd had for a few years and the Air's screen sort of killed it for me.  I was getting used to the OS X operating system, but all in all I just didn't feel it was worth the $1,000 I'd spent.  So, I returned it and went with another PC.  Fast forward nine months.  I've literally gone through three PC's, all of which had a combination of major and minor flaws.  From utterly terrible trackpads to battery life that were barely over an hour and a half, I realized that modern PC's are being made as cheaply as possible and nobody really seemed to expect them to last more than a year or two.  That's when I remembered how incredibly sturdy the Macs were, and decided to give them another shot.\n\nI decided to fork over the ~$1,300 for a 13\" MacBook Pro with retina display and I absolutely love it.  The screen is pristine and clear, the keyboard is phenomenal, the construction is completely solid, and the battery life is phenomenal (I get roughly between 8-10 hours depending on how heavy my workload is, but always running at 100% screen brightness).  On top of that, the single greatest feature is the trackpad.  Scrolling is so unbelievably fluid compared to PC's.  Wherever your finger goes, so too does the indicator, and 2-finger scrolling seems second nature.  Add to that the precision and ease of the 2015's new electronic pressure click, and it's hands down the greatest trackpad available today.\n\nBottom line, buy this laptop.  You won't regret it.  I'm done with PC's from here on out, and firmly in the Apple camp."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00UGBMRQ8", "review": "I've had this computer for nearly three years. So far, its logic board has been replaced twice: once because of defective memory and once because of defective video card under the MacBook Pro Repair Extension Program for Video Issues (...). Its top case has been replaced once under warranty because of defective battery. The retina display's anti-reflective coating has been peeling off progressively for the past year. The latter issue is a well documented manufacturing defect (please refer to the links below) which Apple has so far refused to address and for which I've been turned down twice under warranty.\n\nUltimately, the only original parts of my MacBook Pro still intact are:\n\n the bottom case (which is just a piece of aluminium);\n the SSD;\n the defective display (see attached pictures).\n\nUntil recently, I was known as an Apple aficionado. Sadly, I must now admit that Apple's product quality, including software, has been steadily declining since I bought my first PowerBook G4 more than 12 years ago. It's a shame and it makes me feel bad in front of people to whom I was preaching in the past. Lesson learned.\n\n(...)\n(...)"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00UGBMRQ8", "review": "This review is for the mid-2015 MacBook Pro 15.4 inch retina. 2.5ghz, 16 gigs ram, 512 gigs memory, Intel iris and AMD graphics.\n\nI have owned it for eight weeks now. My review only reflects what I have encountered thus far for my needs.\n\nI got this computer because I am a college student, an Internet abuser, and most importantly, a software developer. This is my first Apple product after the iPad Air which I thoroughly enjoy. I switched from windows because windows 8 was beyond frustrating in so many ways, enough to make me experiment on something new. Folks have been saying for years that Apple machines are designed to create digital media, so I gave in.\n\nThe Pros\n\nSpeed. The Adobe creative suite runs like a champ. Waiting time is measured in half seconds for even the largest files. I am blown away by this. The programs no longer show any load time.  They just work when you click the icon. Android Studio, Xcode, eclipse. Sometimes the splash screen whizzes by in an instant, even when several editing programs are open at once. I have yet to encounter a loading bar. Going through thousands of photos in the file manager? No loading. There they are.  Very cool. I used to walk around with a half open laptop because once you close windows you can wait forever for it to start up. Not with this thing. I close it and open up right where I left off.\n\nSpeaker volume. In the summer heat we keep the air conditioning on which made watching movies on other laptops and the iPad straining on the ears. This machine is loud booming and proud. It is not a boom box but you never want it to be full volume in public.\n\nThe keyboard feels amazing. I type fast. Very fast and very hard. I was worried the keyboard would be too soft or be too flat. I assumed it would take a while to get used to a new keyboard. I was wrong. My hands felt like they finally found their home.  The touch pad never, ever accidentally interferes. And it glows and it has a dimmer switch. Nice work Apple.\n\nGraphics. I went to download some first person shooter games to test the AMD card. It was quite unusual to check off max graphics performance settings and will take getting used to. Another thing to note is that the anti-glare screen is quite effective even with a bright lamp behind me. I noticed that what was once a problem on my previous computer is a thing of the past.\n\nFunction Keys. No mysteries here. I use them often, to do things such as dim the screen and keyboard, volume control, and open window navigation. It sounds small but the little things count. They are very effective and make sense.\n\nBattery power. It depends on what I am doing, but i get a full 8 hours when I am using it for browsing and development work. This number goes down to 4-6 for watching movies via the browser. It charges relatively quickly. I have gone from zero battery to full charge in about an hour, which is better than my phone!\n\n I really appreciate the power cable being as long as it is. The extension is permanently attached for me but can be taken off. I question who actually uses just the smaller connector. I also like the feature that has a light turning green when it is fully charged.\n\nThe cons.\nThe Apple App Store kind of sucks. This is understandable given that so many things can be found in the browser. There are noticeably not many games compatible with Macintosh, despite their brand popularity. Steam is very sad to go through. That little windows icon is on everything and the Apple logo on very little.\n\nNo side split screen. A feature that all developers use is split screen. Following a guideline or tutorial is much easier when you can dual screen. I really miss this feature from windows.\n\nMouse compatibility. We have an apple Magic Mouse from 2010 era and the laser on it does not register. It works on older macs but not this one. Kind of annoying and sad. A touchpad will just not do for photoshop and precision gaming controls.\n\nThe file system is weird. Is everything stemmed down from the desktop? As a former windows user I am used to seeing the trees. With this, not so much. I worry about cluttering my desktop.\n\nThe arm rest is kind of sharp on the edge. This leaves red line marks on my wrist at times. An oversite by engineers?!\n\nMy final verdict is this is the most capable, powerful machine I have owned thus far, and I can see why so many people love MacBook.  The attention paid to little details shows a love of design by Apple and the effort they put into their money maker shows. I look forward to putting serious use into this machine for at least five years."}

I started looking around and found this group of users who had exactly the same issue, also after a year-or-so use. Apparently it's the screens anti-reflective coating wearing off. I always treated my rMBP in a careful way, cleaned it in the prescribed way and looking at the pictures of other users who tell the same story this can't be our own fault. Apple doesn't acknowledge this manufacturing defect and refuses to replace the screen in most cases, even within the warranty period.\nThink twice before buying this machine and lookup 'staingate' on the interwebs to see how widespread this is."}

Apple refuses to acknowledge this is their fault, blaming me for not taking care of my notebook - when in fact I have only ever followed their recommended cleaning instructions.\n\nApple meticulously censors their product forums to prevent people from organizing and discovering how widespread this problem is. Eventually I discovered this is a widespread issue. Google \"mac staingate\". There is a website and facebook group joined by thousands of sufferers from all over the globe, and a class action lawsuit is under consideration by a major law firm. BTW, even people who purchased Apple Care have been turned down. The exceptions are people who have had to complain loudly and repeatedly until they were granted a personal exemption and got their screen replaced. It shouldn't have to be this way. :( Watch out for the contingent of Apple fanboys who will claim we're just \"cleaning it wrong\" despite plenty of evidence to the contrary.

But was very confused because of price range. For a while I was looking to buy Mac Book Air, which could be cheaper. But could not take eyes away from Retina Display. When I came across Dell XPS 13, I waited thinking that would be best tradeoff between price and display as it mentioned as Infinity Display with resolution more than Mac Book Pro. I paid $1000 to pick up a Dell XPS 13 only to return back in next 30 minutes. The display is no way near to Mac Book pro and mouse pad is just unusable. I really do not see myself using touch screen on a laptop. At that time i was fully determined to take Mac Book Pro. But because I wanted i7 model, I need to pay $500 more, but, get 16 GB and 15\" as part of that money.\n\nBoy, I cannot be more happy I took that decision. I am enjoying each day with Mac Book Pro. The laptop is stunningly amazing both from outside and inside. The best is the display, it just keeps your eyes frozen on the screen. I am long time user of Windows OS and and was very skeptical about getting used Mac OS. I have to say, the OS is clean, fast and easy to use. Also for development there are more tools for Mac OS X. Other notable hardware item is track pad. Apple has done a wonderful job and this track pad experience is much (much) better working on touch screen with Dell XPS 13. The system is very light weight and fast with no noise."}

I as a long time windows user, finally decided to give Mac a try on the frontier of workstation. I was drawn immediately by the appearance of the laptop. The total design gives it a much more premium feel. I know Apple has been using this same design for many years, but why switch if the design still works? I also find it to be pretty thin and light, for a workhorse. I can carry it around quite easily, which is a huge plus for me.\n\nAs far as performance, I think I am pretty much getting what I would expect from a workstation: blazing-fast speed, beautiful display, reliable hardware and software. That's the good side.  For the bad side, there is fan noise and heat. Yes, most computers run pretty hot and loud with relatively demanding tasks, and Macbook Pro is no exception. I also want to point out another thing. That's the price. You can very likely get a similar spec PC workstation with lower price than this Macbook Pro. But for Apple, I guess you pay more for the quality of product and service, more reliability, etc. Again, which aspect should be valued more, everyone has their own opinion."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00UGBMRQ8", "review": "If you take a look at last years model it has a 5 start rating and this one is even better. For 2015 Apple has added a newer SSD thats over double the speed of last years (which was already faster than standard). They swapped out the trackpad for a brand new design called force touch that doesn't actually click but simulates a click with magnets. If you didn't know it you wouldn't be able to tell! It fells just like a click but with the benefit of being quieter and more consistent no matter where you press. It allows you to press harder to get a secondary click for more functions on OS X as well as track sensitivity. Apple already had one of the best trackpads and this is a big jump in quality, hard to go back to the 2014 after using this one.\n\nThe last update is the new AMD GPU. This results in support for 5K displays, 1 extra hour of battery life, and from 20% to over 100% improvement in apps like Final Cut X which use OpenCL. The raw power is similar between last years Nvidia GTX 750M (Apple lists 20% improvement). With programs that are still biased towards CUDA the 2014 model is slightly better with the Nvidia card but most software is being updated and OpenCL will be taking over in the near future.\n\nI took a good while and compared this 2015 version to last years model with Nvidia graphics and wrote out a full article as well as YouTube video Testing multiple benchmarking programs as well as 1080P and 4K tests with and without effects. Also included is stabilizer tests as well as test where I have 4x 4k clips scaled into a 4K timeline, each clip has 2 Luts applied and film grain. This is a VERY CPU/GPU intensive test. Theres too much information to pass on here but you can check that out just do a search for Max Yuryev 2014 VS 2015 Macbook Pro and you'll find the video, as well as a link to the full article in the video description. The article also has results from the same tests run on my $5000 MacPro, $3000 5K retina iMac, and $1300 mackintosh for you to compare these MacBooks to.\n\nIf your looking for a laptop for video editing this thing will get the job done. I've used multiple high end windows laptops (MSI,Alienware,etc) and this is the one to go for!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00UGBMRQ8", "review": "This is a beautiful laptop. It's lightning fast and half the size of my old Macbook Pro with Handoff compatibility, a slightly faster processor, a studier solid state drive, and gorgeous Retina display to boot. I have to admit that was really, really tempted to get the new Macbook because it's even lighter than this one, by about 1.4 pounds if you want to get specific, and I knew I'd feel the extra 1.4 pounds carrying it around on campus. I eventually decided on the Pro, mainly because the 1.3 GHz processor on the regular Macbook was a huge step down from my old Mac Pro and I thought it would bother me to have a slower processor, but also for a host of other reasons.\n\nFirst off, price. Since I was already getting a 512 GB memory to fit all my music and photos, it was actually only a $100 difference to get the Pro. More importantly, in the end, it would have actually been the same price since Apple charges $80 for the Macbook adaptors. See, there's one port on the new Macbook for power and everything else, so you'd need an adaptor to plug in, say, headphones or a USB cable. Apple insists that this is the way of the future and everything can be done wirelessly, but honestly? I'm not there yet. The Pro, on the other hand, has two USB ports, an SD card port, an HDMI port, two lightning ports, and a headphone port in addition to the power supply port. Apple has taken out the disk drive since my 2011 model to make the computer thinner and lighter, but if you really need one, you can get an external lightning-connected one. Honestly, I never used mine, and I prefer the lighter weight of the new Pro over having a disk drive I thought I might use but never did, since now it's actually feasible to take this powerful laptop to class or a caf without having a freaking brick in my backpack.\n\nLet's talk personal use, though. That's the big thing to consider when buying a computer-- what you'll be using it for. As a college student, I sometimes run web-based Virtual Machines on my computer because Macs don't have ArcGIS, a map program I use in my classes and research. This was a big factor in deciding to get the Pro instead of the slower (but lighter) new Macbook. When I got home and tested out the VM on my new Pro, it laughed at my silly test. I could switch between the VM and other Mac apps seamlessly, and even running ArcGIS didn't seem to slow down my computer. That's a huge, bulky program, so it's pretty incredible to have that kind of power. My mom went with the Pro for the same reason; she's a doctor and used a VM of sorts before I'd even heard of them; she has a remote connection to her Windows desktop at work so she can access her digital ultrasound images when she's at home. My sister, on the other hand, mainly uses her computer for browsing and watching videos and writing an essay for school every so often, so she has a Macbook Air and would likely be a new Macbook type of user if she were currently in the market for a new computer. Basically, if you use your computer for VM's, Photoshop, video and music editing, or anything other than just basic browsing, video-watching, and document editing, you will appreciate having the more powerful Pro. Even if you do just use it for essay-writing, having 15 tabs of sources open on Safari plus your current draft open on Word will be a breeze with the Pro. I haven't even seen the Mac beach ball in the two months since buying this computer. For gaming, though, you'll want the 15-inch Pro because it has a dedicated graphics card... unless you want to run all your games at the lowest possible graphics settings and frame rates.\n\nHonestly, the decision of what computer to buy is based on your personal needs, preferences, and budget. But let me assure you, this is an amazing computer. It's lighter and thinner than any other Macbook Pro without sacrificing any of the computing power that comes with the Pro line. The battery life is more than enough to last me all day in classes. It's incredibly fast and makes running big programs look easy. And I have to gush about the Retina display. It is amazing. I'm really not one to go gaga over the newest high-definition thing, but compared to my 2011 Macbook, the display is so crisp and sharp and colorful. Technically speaking, the only difference between Retina and the older screens is sharpness because of the higher pixel count, but it makes a huge visual difference in image quality. I can't speak for durability and long-term use just yet as I've had it less than two months, but I will update later on that topic. As of right now, though, I am very happy with my decision to get the powerful Pro over the shiny new Macbook."}

The machine is clearly overpriced compared to Windows machines of similar configuration that come with additional GPUs.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00UGBMRQ8", "review": "I suffered with Microsoft for 20 years, but the apple computers we had in college never impressed me either. They were clunky and crashed as often as windows. Windows 7 gave false hope that Windows may be ironing its problems finally but Windows 8 and later 8.1 and 8.2 shattered all my hopes and I decided after 20 years of suffering, enough is enough. I decided to try and see what apple is all about. The ride pricing, the low specs, the fact that only unsay people around me seemed to use apple was always a deterrent. I decided to bit the bullet:\n\n1. Call apple to buy a mac, I was put on home for 5 minutes before I could talk to anyone. BAD SIGN right there. You are trying to cough up good cash to a company and they are not even giving you a good initial impression?\n\n2. The sales person had little training and was unable to answer any of my concerns about apple's puny specs and high prices. Instead of defending Apples alleged advantages, he says so did you want to go ahead with the order?\n\n3. A day after the order, I remembered from years ago that you can get MacBooks from amazon about 10% cheaper. So I called them and asked if they would extend that as a courtesy. They said I should have asked when ordering. I asked to talk to a manager. They said sure, hold on! They kept coming back to me every 2 minutes and saying please wait. I waited 40 minutes to talk to a manager. Id di all this to test their crappy system. The manager said the same thing and asked that I order from amazon and by the time I was done, I had been on the phone for 50 minutes. BAD SIGN!\n\n4. I said screw it I am ordering from amazon. I got a return authorization and ordered from amazon. Amazon laptop showed up 5 days later. By then, I had played with the 1st laptop a little to test it and learn appleze way of doing things. It was not as intuitive as usually claimed. \n\n5. I tried the apple migration tool to migrate the files I had created on the first macbook. I had basically loaded up 10 gigs of photos to the first macbook and favorited them and done some editing. I wanted to test the migration tool that touted to make your life so much easier; one of the reasons I wanted to switch to a mac. i did not want to trash a laptop every 2 years and set up a new one like I had done for years with Windows.\n\n6. The migration thru wifi sucked as it went thru for a few hours and froze. It did not go any further for half a day. I called them later and had to wait a while each time and overtime I would ask them to call me back in half an hour, instead of the tech calling me again, i would get a robot call, had to punch in numbers and wait 5 minutes to talk to a completely different person.\n\n7. The techs would claim the previous tech was maybe out to lunch or such, but this happened a 3rd time. When I complained to the 3rd tech why I don't get call back from the 1st tech, she (Ebony) hung up.\n\n8. The tech support took 2 hours of my time to basically convey a simple message of holding control-R after rebooting and trying again. The migration had started with the 2nd tech person, but was showing 43 hours to complete!!! They said that is normal and maybe cable usage in your area is too high right now.\n\n9. So the migration from laptop to another sitting next to it was going thru the local internet traffic and I was not going to dash out and buy a thunderbolt cable as I was not sure I like Apple by that point. Their local store is also a zoo and their tech support had proven to be no oversees but poorly trained Americans on $10/hr.\n\n10. The migration indeed took 50 hours and it finally failed!!! I videotaped my saga over two days to document this. At the end, it said, migration complete, wait a minute. That one minute took 6 hours and having waited 50 hours with no computer to use. I decided to reboot and cancel the migration. So much for that. I exported the images and dumped them on the new computer and lost a lot of my editing steps and other things I had done.\n\n11. I have managed to use the new macbook pro for the last week and I must say, I have found it far from user-friendly.  The simplest edit commands in their version of word and excel, are hidden in the most ridiculously hidden places.  On multiple occasions, I had to spend 10 minutes looking up and down in their various apps for a simple command which is in your face in Windows.  Example: In the spreadsheet app stupidly called Numbers, I wanted to turn a column of numbers to percentages.  I looked up and down.  They have a lineup of drop down menus at the top, a bunch of icon menus below it and a bunch of other menus to the right.  I could not find the stupid thing.  Even looking things up on their help pages, means having to read a whole page or poorly written instructions and following them.  I am PhD in Physics and have done C, C++ and Ruby programming in my day, yet I have found myself, taking a photo of their help menu so I can begin following the long ass instructions.  Case in point:  doing a factory rest of the first laptop before sending it back.  Youd thing it would a few pushes of the button and cruising;  No way!  The instructions are not a few simple steps and intuitive.  You really have to use the help file (not stupid clear) and spend an hour at the computer waiting to click different things.  And since I make sure the drive is completely empty of my private stuff, after a factory reset, I filled the drive with a blank video file that I copied many time to max out the drive before another factory reset.  This way the drive is rewritten completely with junk and wiped again.\n\n12.  The new macbook pro heats up quite a bit and many apps crash left and right.  Firefox has crashed 3 times, the Photos app has crashed more than 10 times and other apps have crashed too.  Every time showing me a bunch of crash code!!!  Do I need to see a bunch gobble gobble as a user in 2015?  The machine gets so hot that it becomes burning hot.\n\n12. We are in 2015, computers should be working for us not the other way around.  Things need to be user-friendly, intuitive and stupid simple.  I have found myself up till 2am trying to back up things, transferring date, trying to fix an issue, setting up a cloud storage that fails (Clouds are all SH***).  This is ridiculous!  So much of my time is wasted these past two weeks on these 2 laptops.\n\nI am either sending this 2nd laptop back and buying a new one from amazon or just saying goodbye to apple altogether.\nThis review has ridiculous indentation because I am fighting their word app (Pages) not to indent things and it keeps changing things.  Is this company run by Bill Gates?  Hate it!!!!!  I HATE THIS!!!!"}

Though, I'd prefer to see a Nvidia 960m or 980m in this machine. I don't think the Nvidia would have negatively impacted battery life because low power functions don't use the Dedicated GPU.\n\nI've only tested with Blizzard games thus far. I predict based on tests performed by other users on youtube with battlefield 4 (Frostbyte 3 engine) that this machine will perform well with the impending Starwars Battlefront (also Frostbyte 3).\n\nWith the Windows 10/Directx 12 improvements, Frostbite 3 games will do very well on this machine at 1050p graphics/medium/low with the new Starwars game.\nBut we will see.\n\nOverall, this is an excellent machine. Good Durability, outstanding performance and portability. No high quality laptop can be made with plastic. The full aluminum frame does an excellent job of protecting the structural integrity of this machine. No other laptop except Razer branded laptops are made of this material. Others may have a aluminum exterior but plastic interiors which warp under heat and degrade over a period of 1 year of use.\n\nNothing beats the quality of the Mac OS X as well, which is one of the main reasons for this purchase.\n\nThis machine tops all other laptops as far as performance with the exception of the bulky, heavy, plastic, burning hot gaming laptops with dual 980m's."}

It stutters and pauses as you switch windows or use the \"Show all windows\" or \"show desktop\" functions. You have to \"increase contrast\" and \"reduce transparency\" in the accessibility options to make it perform OK, but with a UI that looks like s***.\n\n* You have no option to upgrade to a better graphics card.

It is incredible that you can \"upgrade\" your laptop after 5 years and the new laptop vastly underperforms the one 5 years ago.

I spoke with support a few times and they were unsuccessful in debugging the issue. I then swapped my Bluetooth peripherals to another MacBook, tested them and determined the problems were isolated to the MacBook Pro Retina. Since I wanted to confirm the issues were indeed related to the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth module I swapped the Wi-FI Bluetooth module from another unit we had in office and determined the issues followed the module. I openly explained my troubleshooting and debugging process to the Apple Store Genius and was met with ridiculous comments and accusations. I even told them that I used electrostatic discharge protection gloves and grounding before completing the swap but this meant nothing to them.\n\nI calmly tried to explain that by me swapping units to determine if one was faulty does not in fact void my warranty but the Genius technician and his manager both held firm that customers were not to open their laptops and opening a laptop and swapping parts voids your Apple warranty unless a Genius themselves does the install.. I even mentioned the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act of 1975 and also pointed them to the following legal article, https://www.apple.com/legal/warranty/products/embedded-mac-warranty-us.html  but they had no idea regarding any of this and didn't seem to care.\n\nI was charged for the Bluetooth replacement, while under AppleCare warranty which does not expire until September 5, 2016. I can tell you firmly that this experience has left my confidence in Apple shaken. I was the main contributor at my company who pushed for us to start allowing Apple laptops into the Enterprise.

Unfortunately, I did not investigated enough to find out on time the change program for an issue in the Video Card. The replacement costs about 600 so I decided to buy a brand new, stylish, d** good looking new MBP with a super retina display. Everything in the laptop works fine: lighter, nice and crisp image, optical audio output, speedy USBs... but if you are a fanatic of the high resolution, you will be disappointed. Apple very diplomatically states on the resolution adjustment: \"Using a scaled resolution may affect performance\". May affect?? If you have a super-hyper-mega brand new Apple MacBook PRO, you would expect to be able to use everything of you laptop to the limit (the over price is not about buying more quality and performance?), the performance of the laptop is very notoriously affected with the resolution change: it just turns slow in many video transitions, new windows, even the writing.\n\nSo, retina display is very good looking screen with more than Full HD resolution, but with this laptop, scaling to my 5 years old laptop desktop resolution (1680x1050), turns this laptop into a turtle. Youtube video, lagging, slow window transitions, slow writing, delayed clicking, will be some of the different behaviors you will be face using higher-res scaling display resolution. Therefore, I have to settle with seeing big font windows (1280x800) and Full HD youtube videos, if I want no very notorious performance penalties.\n\nThe funny part of this story is that with all the excitement I bought a 4K screen to see the superb resolution of the laptop was capable of.  I have to say that the laptop was able to use the full res of the screen at 60MHz using the thunderbolt port, but IMHO it is too slow for a high end laptop, and even slower for any Apple demanding customer .\n\nUpdate July 8-2015. Three stars with the latest Yosemite update. The performance improved notoriously, even though, the laptop still suffers with the external monitor."}

It took me a while to get adjusted, but slowly I started to fall in love with the operating system. I noticed that I didn't have to do simple things such as virus scans, etc. At the end of the year I had to give my computer back and I went back to my PC. It wasn't that my PC was bad, it wasn't able to handle my software needs (Adobe Creative Suite). It was at that moment that I decided to take the Macbook plunge and buy my own. I felt like I had some time to make an informed decision since I spent most of the year working on a Macbook, but I decided for a little more power.

I appreciate th fct that it  is new and different enough that I am even writing a review, but the claims of many that this is the dominant force in laptops is very suspect.  I like it, but its not enough to render me an outright convert, as my previousl laptop was faster, brighter and so fresh when  it was unboxed, I thought I would be a repeat owner of a Vaio Z series.  My prior laptop was extraordinary, and was  so big when it was opened the word Qosmio  literally overwhelmed me.

I'm a fan of those machines, no other word to call these computers, they last for a long time of heavy use, the design is gorgeous , durable, and performance is outstanding, No viruses issues and very fast.\nOnce you go mack never go back!!!!!!\nWIFI won't reconnect after wake up, this is very annoying."}

I am very happy with my decision, it is faster than my macbook air and the Display is fantastic, if you are thinking of buying this computer you will not regret it, it is the best OS experience and the quality of the hardware just blows away competition one more thing the force touch trackpad is very intuitive and it is very nice you feel like you are pressing the trackpad but it is actually a haptic feedback. All in all best personal laptop to date for personal use and business.\n\nP.S. I also recommend checking out the bookbook case from twelve south for the macbook pro retina 13 inch i bought it and it fits like a glove and it is very elegant and  protective it makes your macbook pro stand out even more, the leather feels very nice,  a keyboard protection just in case of an accident i would recommend also."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00UGBMRQ8", "review": "Okay, I'm more of a gaming laptop/pc guy but I decided to give my first mac a try. Impressive aesthetics, really sleek and nice.\nHowever there are many issues with this computer on start up that really bothered me and made my experience with a mac not that great.\n\nAs soon as I turned on the computer, it froze as I tried to sync information. I am not blaming the seller, I am blaming mac's OS and its glitchy services. The new \"Yosemite X\" has its glitches, and its really annoying to have to research on my other computer to see whats wrong.\n\nAnother problem I had was when I awakened my computer from sleeping, the wifi would not work. I had to reconnect and connect, which of course, is very irritating. I fixed it , however it took intensive research to fix it.\nFor a computer thats base priced at 1300 you would expect much better performance, but sadly it isn't that great.\n\nBut currently I am happy with it, the battery is ok, and its very aesthetically pleasing. So if you want to buy this computer, make sure you're prepared for some early booting issues."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00UGBMRQ8", "review": "I have been thinking about replacing my 2011 macbook air for quite a long time now. Initially it was very slow on Yosemite but I found variety of tweaks to make the Macbook Air actually very effective with Yosemite. The Air is a fantastic computer and even today I think it offers a great array of services. Why did I want to upgrade then? I'm bitten by the Apple bug plus I like to watch films on my laptop (even though I have a projector and a tv)\n\nSo I thought about it and thought about it and then finally decided to go to a retailer who was offering it for 99k and purchased the 256GB variant. free space is about 230GB so that means Yosemite is definitely consuming more space. With my Macbook Air, I was always deleting various films after watching them just so I can download more so I went the safe route, have spent more money and got this variant.\n\nIs it seriously fast? Yes, boot times is low, files open just the same as my macbook air, I am not seeing a substantial jump from that point but I think such changes require longer times to fathom. There are some youtube videos which look remarkable, the speakers are much louder but they're not loud enough to replace my external bluetooth speaker. But still I am impressed. Could the speakers have been better? Sure. Are they loud enough to watch a video? Sure.\n\nThe keyboard like all \"macbook\" keyboards is pretty good. It is not very different from the Air but the place your palms rest when you type is more solid and more comfortable at the same time. The trackpad is fun, it does a bunch of fancy things but \"Force Touch\" remains largely at entry stage. Do you feel an electronic vibration? Hell no. I first thought there is something wrong with my model but researching told me this is just how it works. Well, it is pretty solid.\n\nThe battery life is about 8 hours equalling with my iPad Air (Almost) and this is a very important thing. People always told me I can attach an external charger and keep it plugged in. However, I don't do this. I only attach the charger when battery is in the red, I disconnect it when it goes GREEN. Years of computing has taught me this. This also helps longevity of battery. So make sure you monitor battery health closely. It feels wonderful to know I can go somewhere for the day without even carrying a charger.\n\nFeatures I like -\na) Screen is brilliant. Whether on youtube or surfing, whether I am watching a video. It is not as bright as the macbook air but when I compare it with my macbook air, I can't help but feel the Macbook Air has apology in keeping up with videos whereas Retina is just crisp, beautiful, more vibrant than anything I have seen. Except maybe my iPhone.\nb) Speakers are loud and adequate.\nc) So far it doesn't make fan noise, it doesn't heat up as much as my Macbook Air did. My Macbook Air would start whiriring when uTorrent would play with battery power.\nd) The Force Touchpad is very good. The screen borders are black accentuating the effect of the screen. That is a great idea. There's a reason 99% TV's have black bezel.\ne) The mechanism to open the laptop is unique and very finely paved. Also it has a HDMI port without the need for an external accessory. I did try this once and will try it more and add feed back later.\n\nTHINGS I DISLIKE -\nThe charger that accompanies this computer seems very very easy to break. Beware.\nApple has included things like \"Keynote\" , \"Pages\" , \"Numbers\" , etc. Who needs all this? I don't, brother and If I did I should be allowed to add it.\nThe Micro Fiber cloth included to wipe the macbook will last you exactly 2 days.\n512GB model costs so much more. Apple is really mean.\nWhy is this not 20% brighter? I know I said I like the way the screen looks but the fact that the Macbook Air is brighter is kind of troubling. Supposing i'm out in the sun, the brighter computer will definitely be easier to view. Ever noticed how your phone goes max brightness when you're out in the sun...\nI really think the Macbook Air keyboard was 15% easier to type on. The keys depressed significantly better.\n\nSome people are concerned about the Macbook Retina being heavier. Yes, it i substantially heavier but it is good weight. The construction feels very fine. I have muscles so I think I'll be ok. Does the weight make it difficult to carry? NOT REALLY.\n\nWhy invest in Retina over Air? The screen and future proofing.\nLooking for value for money? AIR\nLooking for no apologies? MBP Retina.\n\nTo conclude, this machine is really good looking and really effective. It does everything very well, including multimedia, web browsing, video viewing. I am not the guy who's going to edit a bunch of videos or anything but I love this machine. I think even for daily tasking this is a very strong machine. I don't like how people assume only professionals need to get one. I wish Apple would tell me what to do with these useless Thunderbolt ports. I have never used them in my life and don't think I will."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00UGBMRQ8", "review": "Just a background about myself: I owned the early 2008 15\" MacBook Pro, and late 2011 15\" MacBook Pro. I am a former engineer and now a finance manager. I play videogames, used for programming (C++, Matlab, R, SQlL, etc.) and did normal productivity tasks. I also record music with Fender/Gibson guitars.\n\nThe changes from the 2011 15\" MacBook Pro:\n\nPros\n- New ports that were not in the 2011 model: HDMI port, extra Thunderbolt video port (now it has two instead of one)\n- New Radeon graphics card (FINALLY!). I had the chance to test the new Radeon graphics card and it's really good.\n- Retina display is actually sharper. I thought that it wouldn't make any difference, but it DOES on games\n- The computer is 1 pound (approx. 500g) lighter. This is a huge plus!\n- Drives are now Solid State Drive. That is awesome. Super fast boot.\n- (update!) When the computer is working hard, it doesn't burn my lap anymore (although I do feel some hot air flowing through my fingertips, when I am typing, but I am okay with that).\n\nCons\n- (update!) The new magsafe 2 power adapter is worse than the previous generation. The plug keeps unplugging. I think Magsafe 1 had an optimal grip: if you stepped on the cord, and pulled with enough power to drag the computer, the plug would disconnect. However, for gentle pulls, it didn't disconnect. With Magsafe 2, even the gentlest pull makes the plug to disconnect, which is very annoying for me.\n- New built-in speakers. They look the same compared to the 2011 model, but they are slightly worse. The drums in rock songs look very artificial.\n- Memory is not easily upgradable anymore. WHY THIS, APPLE? SERIOUSLY?\n- SSD (Solid State Drive) is not easily upgradable. See my comment above\n- No ethernet connection and firewire 800 port. Honestly, I think nobody uses these ports anyway.\n- No AUDIO IN port. Now audio in and out are combined in just one port... I don't like this.\n- No DVD drive. A separate device from apple is $70. It's very expensive for such a simple device. There are similar models from $20 to $40.\n- The screen is harder to clean. Maybe that's a consequence of how the retina display is built, but yeah, it's harder to keep the screen clean.\n\nNeutral:\n- Keyboard keys have a shorter touch. I'm okay with that given that the body is thinner.\n- Touch feedback trackpad. In the beginning I felt a little weird about this trackpad. I couldn't drag-and-drop items in it, but after I changed the behavior in settings, everything went well from there. I honestly didn't think it changed much from my regular trackpad on the 2011 model.\n\nOverall, I think it is a great purchase."}

I think Apple should at least bump the CPU speed and integrate a faster graphics card, though this one is still good but there is better. Don't get me wrong, still best laptop in the market but not too exciting for owners fro 2012 to 2014 models. Hope my detailed review in youtube will be helpful.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00UGBMRQ8", "review": "I purchased the new mid-2015  2.5Ghz i7  15\" Macbook Pro Retina with ForceTouch, and upgraded AMD Radeon R9 M370X Graphics Card.  I upgraded from last years model that still used the Nvidia Graphics Card, so far I love everything about the new Macbook Pro.  They upgraded the type of flash memory they use for the hard drive so it's quicker at accessing and writing data than the old ones.  Also the graphics card is a lot better than the Nvidia card.  I'm still trying to get used to the ForceTouch, but I think after a week or so i'll really enjoy it as well.  The design is identically to the past few years model, so nothing to report about there.  If you have last years model with the dedicated graphics card, depending on what you use it for, it may not be worth the upgrade.  But if you have one that is a couple years old or older, or don't have the version with the dedicated graphics card, then its definitely worth the upgrade."}

The new pro model is very light and compact, and can easily be carried around with you every day. The display is amazing and the new force click trackpad is an awesome addition. It's a little weird at first, knowing that the button isn't actually moving when you click down, but you definitely get used to it.\n\nThe Mac Pro is also very fast, and I have only experienced the rainbow wheel once or twice whenever I was on a website that wasn't responding.\n\nThe only issue I have with it (and hence the four star rating) is the battery life. Although I read countless reviews that said it had above average battery life, I don't seem to be getting that. Playing simple 2D games for 30-45 minutes would kill the battery almost 30%, even with the backlight keyboard off and screen dimmed. Playing Star Wars KOTOR was worse. I blew through almost 80% of a full battery on just over an hour of gameplay (playing a 12 year old game!). The only time I seem to get more than 10 hours is if it's on standby or if I'm just browsing the web and listening to music.\n\nBattery issues aside, I really love this laptop and it is easily the nicest piece of electronics I have ever owned."}

I bought this computer because I have opted in the past to purchase PCs and not one of them has lasted. This is my first MacBook purchase. My iMac is still kicking and I purchased this in 2006. So I figured I would bite the bullet and buy this expensive laptop. So far I am loving everything about it. The instant on and speed is crazy. I was able to add windows using VMware and added all of the MSOffice products. Even when I was installing Windows I was knotting my head in frustration with Windows. Mac OS is so much simpler to use once you get to know all of its capabilities you will love it too. The computer runs Windows better than my PC did. This computer runs cool and has an amazing battery life. I opted for the 128 Gig hard drive and bought a 1 TB external. I also expanded the MS slot to 128GB basically doubling my Hard Drive space through the expanded slot. The 1 TB is easily transported in my computer case and has more than enough hard drive space to keep all of my encrypted information in two locations in case my computer happens to be misplaced or damaged. If you are a DirecTV customer then you can get the premiere insurance for 24.00 per month and have your computer insured for damage and it extends your manufacturers warranty for as long as you pay on the insurance even if its past the 12 month warranty that Apple offers. If you don't have DirecTV then get it. Tell them 58714905 sent you :) that way we both get 100 dollars off. Either way you will not be disappointed with this computer. I am very happy with this purchase. I hope you consider this computer. You will not be disappointed."}

It has taken me a little time to get used to a difference OS but it isn't any harder (or easier) then learning Windows. The design is beautiful and the force feedback track pad is amazing. I was never a track pad guy but this thing is something else entirely.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00UGBMRQ8", "review": "I just picked this laptop up last week and all I have to say is WOW. This thing is really fast. Prior to this macabook I had a mid 2009 macbook pro that after a few years I had even upgraded to ssd after a few years, which did give it some decent speed for being 6 years old. This laptop has one of the latest flash ssd drives you can get in it. It can write data at around 1300 mbps and read at 1800 mbps! If you compare that to a traditional 7200 rpm hard drive that might read and write around 100 mbps. So this computer opens files and apps almost immediately. I ran a few tests with it and it will start from a shut down to the login in screen in just a tick under 7 seconds.  So if you don't like waiting this is definitely a great choice of laptop for you. Also,the new track pad is really nice, it does take a little bit getting used to, since I am personally used to the original track pad. This trackpad doesn't have the long downward click like the original but it works very well and the pressure sensitive touching is something that might take more time for more programs to implement its full potential. So if you don't like waiting this is definitely a great choice of laptop for you The only real couple of minor downfalls on this laptop I would knock on it for is probably the size of the ssd, at only 256 gb you can't store a whole lot on that. But I personally use time machine over my home wifi which makes up for it for me. And the other thing is just some of the hardware they're using in the laptop is a couple years old. 16gb of ram is great. But by todays standards 16gb at only 1600 mhz is on the slow side by todays standards. But it is more than adequate. And also the 2.2 i7 broadwell processor is at least a couple years old now. But to Apple's defense. The newest version of the i7 hasn't come out yet. But if you're looking for the latest apple laptop to upgrade to, you will not be disappointed!"}

I needed the computer to act as my main device outside of work, and having the limited processor from the slimmer brethren would not have allowed me to run the computer in the same incredibly multi-task oriented way I typically do.\n\nWhat matters:\n1. This newest version is materially faster than its predecessors - and it isn't just noticeable in the benchmarks.\n2. I've yet to find a more powerful, thoughtfully designed, and lightweight computer that can handle my day cradle to grave.\n3. If you're coming from a PC you'll love the battery. If you're coming from another Mac laptop you'll either be satisfied or pleasantly surprised.\n4. After a couple weeks of use on the new 'taptic feedback' trackpad I would hate to have to lose it. It did take some time to get used to it, though now when I use my colleagues Macbook Air the standard 'diving board' trackpad click feels like I need a hammer to make it register my click. Less of a fault of the much lauded diving board and more a factor of the very well designed new hardware. Again - it DOES take some getting used to, though I've yet to have any desire to move back to older hardware.\n\nI ran with the 128 because I'm fully capable of managing a small local disk with an enormous cloud drive. If you aren't able to understand uploading media then pay more for a larger SSD.\n\nPersonal thought from experience for managing small local storage when photos and music are your biggest space abusers:\n1- iTunes Match ($25/yr I believe) keeps all of your music synced across all of your iOS devices with no limit. I've found it to be amazing and well worth the cost over the past few years.\n2- Amazon Prime Cloud Drive - Free UNLIMITED storage of photos. There's a limit on other stuff (something like 20GB I think) but the auto upload and unlimited photo storage makes my local storage need about 15GB lighter. There's obviously a cost to get Amazon Prime, though if you are alive, use products, live in a place with an address, aren't in jail: why don't you have Prime?\n\nLast note - I'm incredibly anal about ensuring my very heavily used devices still stay looking like brand new. As such, the first thing I bought was a full body clear skin (www.bestskinsever.com - will shout their glory over InvisibleShield until the day I die) which I installed to perfect results. I've noticed that the build tolerances are so tight on this computer that the edges of the 'inside the clamshell' skin can make small marks on the screen showing where it lines up when closed. A testament to both Apple for really making an engineering marvel and to the effects of the use of such a skin."}

Performance of the SSD is great. If you can get the bigger hard drive it does become a hindrance when you are working on large files that also have cache files (lightroom, photoshop). I bought the stock version, so it's my intent to keep files off of it but we know how computers are. We want to store everything."}

I grew up with PC's and had a terrible experience with them... we use PC's at work as well and we continually have problems.  I had a macbook first generation in 2006, had one issue with it (which promptly got fixed) but then it got stolen when I moved one year so I haven't gotten a new Mac since, except an iPhone and iPad. After doing some research and knowing how long I would need a reliable computer, I just couldn't bring myself to buying a Windows operating system. I recently bough a Chromebook a couple of months ago and thought it would be sufficient enough for school work as the reviews stated.  It wasn't until this week when school started did I find out there that there was programs used for studying and tests that only ran on Windows and Mac.... not Chrome or Chromebooks. So, off to research I went!  I couldn't find any other computer with better reviews. The only reason why didn't give it five stars was the price. Just plain and simple, this computer is expensive compared to many others on the market that are starting to be comparable.  I would have been totally happy with my Chromebook if it could have run the programs needed for school... and java script, and adobe. One other noticeable thing about this laptop compared to my Toshiba Chrombook is that the MacBook Pro with Retina is VERY well built. Feels like steel rather than plastic, feels sturdy, feels new, unlike the Chromebook. But that's the different between $330 and $1299... :/"}

That Mac has been to Iraq twice and still runs like a champ!!  So based on this I didn't think twice about shelling out $1200 for a Macbook Pro.  This is where the love affair ends!!  The fanciest most expensive Mac yet has been the biggest disappointment.  The down arrow key fell off.  Normally not a huge thing but with the current operating system it is required to scroll through websites.  Because my computer is 13 months old, exactly one month out of warranty I have to pay to have it repaired.  Also, what I thought was a blown speaker was actually the bearings going out of the coolling fan.  Grand total for a new keyboard and fan with labor $426!!  I even called Apple to see if I could get a little customer appreciation to no avail.  Stated it was normal wear and tear.  I'm writting this on my 06 model so I don't think that is the case or shouldn't be the case for a $1200 computer.  I am terribly disappointed in today's Apple.  Before making the leap, please research the repair issues I've stated, I am not the only one.  The internet is full of these same issues and the same response from Apple.  I will now be going back to PC where I can get a junk computer for half the price of the garbage Apple now pedals.  Good bye Mac!"}

The magsafe2, the magnetic charging plug is a complete failure in that it disconnects much too easily (unlike the original magsafe). Second the retina display glass is very thin and very fragile. The combination of these design flows leads to broken displays when the magsafe plug is caught inside the computer upon closing, breaking the monitor.\nFinally, annoying but not fatal: the trackpad lacks separate buttons and is hyper sensitive so that the computer perceives a click when web browsing.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00UGBMRQ8", "review": "I ordered this straight from Apple, since I spec'd it out with 16GB ram and 1TB hard drive.  I intended to replace my 2013 Macbook Air, which I love, except for the non-Retina screen.  I had read every review I could find and have read only positive reviews.  I am perplexed as to how anyone using this laptop for more than 10 minutes would miss the issues that were glaring for me.\n\nThe sound from the speakers is atrocious.  The maximum volume is low and requires strain to hear.  It is at about 70% the maximum level of my Macbook Air speakers.  This is compounded by the issue that it appears the sound is coming out from the bottom of the machine.  On the Macbook Air, the sound was rising through the keyboard, not coming down out of the chassis and being muffled.\n\nIn addition, sound from the speakers creates excessive vibration where vibration is uncomfortably noticeable when the laptop is being used on my lap.  This is especially noticeable to me because this issue does not exist on my Air.\n\nI suppose that most people are happy with this machine and in particular don't notice the sound issues, because just about every laptop has terrible sound from the speakers and expectations are low.  However, sound from the Air is outstanding, and I am from a vantage point of seeing a drastic difference.\n\nAlso, I tend to use laptops lying on the sofa with the laptop on my stomach, and this thing is a brick.  I could go the whole day working comfortably with the Air, but I feel this thing on me in every moment.  Yes, I know, per the specs, the Pro seems marginally heavier at half a pound difference.  However, the end perception is not marginal, whether it is the absolute weight difference or the weight distribution difference due to the different shapes of the machines, the Pro is uncomfortable to have sitting on me while the Air was not.\n\nIt is absurd that in 2015 Apple can't make a single laptop that is not a brick, with a good screen, with more than one port, and with a processor with post-2011 performance."}

I bought the original Mac back in the 80's when they first hit the market, and was very impressed with it, but in those days, there was virtually no software to use with it, and I eventually slipped into the Windows world, but never forgot the smoothness of the old Mac even in B/W.\n\nFinally, because I wanted to use Garageband for making backing tracks for my band, I decided to give up my high end laptop PC, and get this Retina Macbook with 256G SSD and 8G memory. I still have 3 Windows PC's as well as three iPads, an iPhone 6, and my new Apple Watch.  I immediately found the Mac offered a simpler way of computing with no, often confusing, installation procedures nor even more frustrating uninstallation steps. Somehow, there as a sense of tranquility and peacefulness in the air. Holy crap! I almost started singing Kumbaya! Well, not really, but it did feel smooth, and the Retina was visually very pleasing. After a few months, however, I have found that the Mac is not completely perfect, though. I find I have just as many program lockups as I had in Windows 7. Very rare, but it does happen. My biggest disappointment is the Macs memory handling. Most apps, most notably Garageband, just keeps getting slower and slower as I use the app, until I have to save my work then reload to app. I enquired with support from another app I use, Audacity, about the slowness, and they admitted that the Mac is a very poor at memory management. Another disappointment is the Mac Finder. This is the Apple equivalent to Windows Explorer. I miss Explorer. It is far superior to Finder. But that's not much to complain about, is it?  That being said, I'd take the Macbook any day, but Windows isn't as bad as what I was starting to think.\n\nPS 5/6/15 I forgot to mention the 256G storage. Pretty slim to my liking, so I bought a 1T portable USB HDD and velcro'd it to the lid. Works great, but if you do this... you just might be a redneck."}

My only other complain is the HD capacity at 256GB is too little for me.

The Apple Performa 6116 CD. Also my first computer. Got it for $2,500 w/printer, ...etc. Back then software availability for Mac was low vs. PC so my next computer in 2000 was a Compaq/HP, then two other PC's after that. I HATE PC's, I HATE Windows, especially the new Windows 8. It's slow and ugly. Too many programs at startup. Slow to boot. When I saw this MacBook Pro 13\" w/Retina for $1,099 I grabbed it no questions asked. Love it. Don't regret my purchase. Hope to use for for 2-3 years for personal and business use, then sell it for $500 and buy another one. Really, when you consider that after 2-3 years you'll be able to get 50% resale value, it's like buying a $1,000+ computer for $500. Not too shabby."}

The Air is light and extremely portable, but the Pro has the ports that I need.  This is a fast laptop with a GREAT screen.  When I look at the screen on my old MBA (which I liked A LOT), the clarity of the Retina becomes very obvious.  The Touchpad on the 2015 Pro is excellent.  Its response, and ForceTouch work very well.  I look forward to seeing what developers do with this new technology.  The Pro is, of course, heavier than the MBA, but the footprint is just a little smaller. The main selling point for me was the additional power and all of the ports, including an HDMI port which I use a lot for business presentations.  With the MBA, I had to carry an extra adapter.\n\nThe 2015 MBPr runs at a decent temperature.  It gets warm, but not quite as \"hot\" as my MBA used to get.  Battery life for me has been a little less than expected.  I can get about 6 hours of battery life with the brightness at about 75% and doing web searches, Excel/Word work, Powerpoint work, streaming music on and off, and watching a couple videos on news sites.\n\nMy most resource intensive applications (Final Cut Pro, Lightroom, and Photoshop) are very smooth on this laptop.  The fan will hit full speed once in a while, but the workflow does not stutter or pause.\n\nAn excellent, well-built laptop with a beautiful screen."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00UGBMRQ8", "review": "Bought this to replace a 2010 MBP. What an awesome laptop! Fantastic build quality, beautiful screen, amazing viewing angles, fast as lightning, silent as a tomb. I have yet to hear the fan start up or feel any real heat from the bottom. It's has enough ports to do whatever I need, I like that the USB's are on opposite sides, as most ports (including the old MBP) are too close together for some clunky thumb drives or cables. The sound is amazing now that Apple moved the ports to the bottom of the laptop. The force touch trackpad is brilliant. It takes a little getting used to but has loads of potential once the applications start utilizing it. I use an older MacBook at work so we'll see how this goes using both. The battery is incredible. I skip carrying my adapter unless I leave town for a couple days. 10 hours easy of average use.\n\nYes, Macs are expensive up front, however, the joy of using such well-engineered, well-built laptops is worth the price. I have to replace my laptop much less often, don't have to fuss with Windows, anti-virus, anti-malware, drivers, constant security update installations/reboots, Metro-tile interface madness, touch screens, styluses (a crutch since no Windows laptop can match the usability or gestures of an Apple trackpad, especially this new force touch model), or dragging around a typical giant, clunky PC laptop power adapter/cord combo with the thick rubber strap to hold it all together.\n\nOf course, you can run Windows on it via BootCamp (free, Google it) or Parallels software, about $70 on Amazon if you have to run Windows programs. This Mac has plenty of speed and memory to run Parallels like butta'.\n\nIf you can afford it, this is the way to go. No PC can touch the Mac experience. Over the long run, they are closer in price then they appear. There's a reason most PC laptops try to look like MacBooks, but ultimately fall well short of a Mac."}

I come from using the original late 2008 aluminum Macbook.\n\nDimensions/Weight:\nThis Macbook Pro is much thinner and a couple centimeters shorter than my old Macbook.  With how slim this thing is I really don't see a need for the Macbook Air line.  It is pretty light if you are coming from any other laptop except a Macbook Air.\n\nDisplay:\nThe display is fantastic on this laptop.  Very sharp screen and good viewing angles.  Something about OS X running with a high resolution display just looks classy in a way that a Windows computer could never match.\n\nBattery life:  I haven't had the laptop for too long but easily get 8 hours or more on a charge.  No complaints here.\n\nKeyboard and Trackpad:\nThe keyboard is ok.  It is not my favorite, in fact my late 2008 aluminum Macbook has a better keyboard.  Just the way the keys feel when they press in, they are a bit softer on this model compared to my old one and I prefer a bit harder feel when typing.  It's all a personal preference.  Other than that, the key sizes are good and the backlighting works just fine.\n\nThe trackpad has gotten better with this new model.  The click is now provided by a haptic engine and provides more functionality.  The thing is fantastic.  The trackpad still does move a tiny bit, but it isn't a big movement like the older type.  This is easily the best trackpad I have ever used.\n\nSpeed:\nThis computer is blazing fast.  Apps open instantly and the AC wifi performance is very nice.\n\nOS:\nWith OS X Yosemite, the OS is very refined and elegant.  You can even run time machine backups while the computer is sleeping now.  I'm not sure when this feature was introduced, but it is very welcome.  The OS is easy to use, the app store lacks many apps that I use, so I have to go directly to the developers site to download them.  I have not messed with the continuity feature much, but it is nice having the favorites and open tabs sync from my laptop to my iPhone.\n\nOverall:\nIn my opinion, having used a Surface Pro 3, older MacBooks and many other computers over the years, this is the closest to perfect I have ever seen a computer get.  If I were to improve anything it would be to switch to the 2008 macbook style keyboard with the \"harder\" feel to the keypress and I would also add a third USB port.  The current model only has two, which can be problematic if you hook up an external hard drive and an external bluray drive (which requires two ports) at the same time.  You need a USB hub to help you in that situation."}

The screen holds its own among high resolution notebook screens. The price represents a decent discount for a device that normally sells at the MSRP. The item came quickly, was well packaged both by Apple and by Amazon and worked perfectly right out of the box.\n\nSome consider Apple gear is overpriced. With respect to this particular notebook, I certainly do not consider this item overpriced but rather a bargain, considering the quality, speed and ease of use, compared to most light weight laptops with SSD storage. I am still learning the intricacies of the Apple platform but I am very happy with this purchase.\n\nUpdate 4/27/15: I can't believe I wrote the review above without mentioning the amazing trackpad, which is a delight to use. This trackpad allows you to 'click' by 'pushing' down anywhere on it's surface and that is a big improvement over a physical push click at the bottom left on the older trackpads or the tap to click which always got me in trouble when an attempt to move the cursor was misinterpreted as a click. This ability to physically click anywhere on the trackpad surface sounds simple but makes a huge difference in ease of use.\n\nUpdate 4/30/15: There seems to be a major problem, at least for some users of this MacBook Pro, when an external monitor is connected and the MacBook is used with the lid closed. After writing my previous review, I connected the MacBook Pro to an external monitor and experienced regular kernel panics that caused the system to reboot unexpectedly. It seemed to only occur when I tried to wake the MacBook from sleep. If the MacBook is used not connected to an external monitor, there has never been a problem with kernel panics. Upon researching this subject I have found a number of forum discussion of this problem of kernel panics, which always seem to occur when an external monitor is connected. Although no one really understands exactly what is going on, it may be a problem with the latest operating system update. I also cannot say how common this problem is, but I definitely am one who experienced it. Right now I have given up on connecting to an external monitor."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00UGBMRQ8", "review": "This is really a strange time to be shopping for a Mac laptop.  There appears to be so much choice, but when push comes to shove, there's actually very little choice.  You're going to have to be a patient reader to see the big picture here -- so I apologize now for the length of this.\n\nTHE BEST OF TIMES\n\nWhen I say it's the best of times to shop for a Mac, I'm talking about the operating system.  Yosemite.  It's not perfect, but it's pretty much the best OS X since it's introduction.  Once you set up Yosemite your way, it will become your best friend and typically leave you alone.\n\nUnlike Windows 8.1, you won't fear updating your system.  Updates aren't constant.  And you won't need to run an antivirus program or malware program.  You won't need to restore your computer to a prior state.  You won't have to deal with a touch interface that doesn't belong on your laptop.  You won't have to look forward to the 'next' operating system's bells and whistles and promises that should have been given to you a decade ago.\n\nIn a nutshell:  your computer isn't a teetering Jenga Tower.  It's not a PC.  It's a Mac.\n\nTHE WORST OF TIMES\n\nSo Apple has this killer operating system and eco-system.  And Windows doesn't.  So you'd think Apple would JUMP at this moment to grab a better share of the home user market by lowering prices a little.\n\nPlease note I said 'a little' before comments come flying in below.  For you see the apologist justification for Apple's high prices is that \"once you start trying to match PC prices, it becomes an unprofitable RACE TO THE BOTTOM\".  But I didn't say 'match' now did I?  I said I'm surprised Apple hasn't dropped prices A LITTLE.\n\nIf you look at the three main choices for 13 inch-ish Macs, you realize you have a choice of either the new anorexic $1299 MacBook 12 incher, a $1299ish MacBook Air, or a $1299ish MacBook Pro.  Not much of a choice if you'd prefer to spend $999.  Right?\n\nWhat Apple is doing at the moment is taking features away from one laptop to add them to the other... but never do you get all the features you might want.  Or to get those features they add a pricey feature you don't want... and still... you're paying $1299ish somehow.\n\nI'm a lifelong Mac user.  Since 1986.  I've never owned a PC.  (Well, I did briefly recently.  If you spy my reviews you'll see what I've already said:  Windows is terrible.)  Anyway, I worked in Apple Store for years and was respected for shooting straight.  Telling it like it is.  So here we go.\n\nIn this day and age of computing on a 13 inch device, here's what most users should get in modern spec --\n\n1.  A Full HD screen (1080p)\n2.  8 Gigs of RAM\n3.  256 SSD onboard\n4.  A processor which can handle your needs\n\nTHE SCREEN -- Why would you want a full HD screen?  That sounds like a judgment I've passed but actually isn't.  Apple asks you to accept either lower res (720p I think) or higher (Retina).  And so 1080 is already in the middle there somewhere -- and more than sharp enough for most users.  But if Apple offered you that,in some cases they'd have to drop prices.  And they don't want to do that.\n\nTHE RAM -- I have a famed review of the prior MacBook Air on this site.  Where I say 4GBs is not enough RAM.  Oh did the apologists attack me for saying as much.  But the discussion is now moot.  Why?  The new MacBook 12 inch includes 8 gigs of RAM.  Why oh WHY would Apple do that if it wasn't necessary?  Apologists will tell you that the system runs 'fine' on so little RAM because of Yosemite memory pressure and compression tricks.  If that's true, then why did Apple include 8 GBs of RAM on the new unit?  Both can't be true.\n\n256 SSD:  This is the modern solid state storage on phones and pads.  You want this in a laptop because it means you can drop your laptop without fearing the old school spinning disc will die upon impact.  And SSDs make systems FEEL much faster, since access of the information on them moves much quicker.  If SSDs were dirt cheap, you'd want a a terabyte of such storage on board.  Since they're still a little pricey, 256 is better than 128 but nowhere near as expensive as 512.  It's a decent compromise for most users, which can be augmented by either an external hard drive, iCloud solutions, or both for data hogs.\n\nPROCESSOR:  your choice is between Intel power house CPUs and the new Intel Core M.  Both are fine but you have to decide if you're going to be a 'light' computer user or a serious one.  More on this in a bit.\n\nIf you look at Apple's current lineup of 13inch-ish laptops, you can't get all of those specs on one unit.  Without a special order that takes you off of Amazon and to Apple's site.  (Ahem.)\n\nMacBook Air --  you can get the fast enough processor and 256 SSD storage, but you win a low res screen (not even 1080p) and you can't get 8 GBs of RAM.  On Apple's site you can add the ram but not the screen -- and your price becomes... $1299.\n\nMacBook Pro -- to get the spec I recommend above, you must spend $1499.  And you're given a Retina display you probably don't need.  Again, a 1080p would do fine here and drop the price.  Why isn't that available?\n\nNew 12 inch MacBook -- includes all the spec I recommend except the 1080p screen... but limits you to a 12 inch screen size and the Intel Core M.  For $1299.  This unit is the most absurd to include a Retina screen because it's frankly too small a screen to make Retina matter.\n\nDo you see what's wrong here?\n\nThe CEO of Nike once asked Steve Jobs what he thought of Nike's products.  No filter Steve said, \"Nike makes some of the best products in the world.  Products that you lust after.  But you also make a lot of crap.  Just get rid of the crappy stuff and focus on the good stuff.\n\nThat is EXACTLY what's wrong here.  If you do enough research between the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro lines, you learn the Pro isn't really that much thicker or heavier.  And yet the spec is much better for almost the same price.  And so... we don't really need the 'crappy' MacBook Air line at all, do we?\n\nThat new skinny anorexic MacBook should have been launched as a 13 inch 'Air'.  With a 1080p screen standard.  With the spec it currently enjoys:  8 GBs of RAM, 256 SSD, Intel Core M.  Take it or leave for it for $999.  The reason I can price it that way is because Asus sells an extremely similar unit for $699.  Since it lacks Yosemite it's technically not similar at all, but you know what I mean.\n\nSuch a MacBook would sell more hotcakes than Dennys.  It wouldn't be a workhorse, but then that's what the MacBook Pro line would be.  An entry level pro with a 1080 P ($999) and then the rest whatever Apple is currently charging for Retina.\n\nMost PC users will tell you that a 1080p laptop for a grand is highway robbery.  I'm willing to say not so fast.  But at $1299?  Yup.  Robbery.\n\n** Sidebar:  this price fixing thing shows itself in the 15 inch MacBook Pro line.  Do you realize you can't get a 15 inch MacBook without coughing up $1999?!?  They force you to have 16GBs of RAM and Retina or it's a no go.  But hey, wait a second... how about a 1080p version of it with 8 GBs of RAM?  Which might be $1499?  Which is still pricey in PC circles but at least reasonable?  You can buy a 15 inch 1080p Chromebook for $349.  I know, I'm comparing Apples with Chromebooks (lol) but I think you see what I see here. **\n\nI'm not trying to convince anyone not to buy a Mac.  I'm trying to show you the shell game currently afoot.  I bet a year from now things will be better balanced.  But it is a worst of times scenario for anyone who feels $1299 is too pricy."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00UGBMRQ8", "review": "I had a MacBook Air before and this MacBook's screen just blows it away.  The 8GB of memory over the 4GB MacBook Air makes a world of difference too.  The 128GB SSD is kind of small but tolerable.\n\nEdit 1 (2015-04-20): Now that I've had this a few days, I've grown more accustomed to the trackpad.  It's an interesting thing, with the force feedback-like operation, but it does feel different to me.  Perhaps that's all in my head knowing that it's fundamentally different.\n\nThis is my first Retina display Mac.  I had some learning to do.  Although it's a smaller screen, I found the default setting makes everything appear too large.  That is, I could fit less content on the screen.  Excluding the very sharp lines and edges, why have such a high-resolution display if you can't use it?  If you go to System Preferences and then Display, then select the Scaled option under resolution, you can change from Default to the More Space options to the right.  It really allows me to use the high-resolution screen as I wish.  The middle display option is a nice balance for me in terms of utility and my old eyes."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00UGBMRQ8", "review": "I've bought my 2015 Macbook pro directly from an Apple Store.  This computer is absolutely wonderful for general everyday use and no doubt has much to offer to a professional.  However, I personally bought this computer as an every day work/play laptop.  I do not like the fact that the new Macs do not have CD drives, don't have LAN ports, and generally you'll have to buy separate \"add on\" attachments for anything external.  Yes the new Mac is lighter than most laptops but the hassle of carrying around an additional CD drive, maybe an extra hard drive, HDMI conversion cable, and so on and so forth is a big pain.  Yes this is a beautiful machine, but for the every day user this is pretty much a glorified Net Book with a bigger hard drive."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00UGBMRQ8", "review": "I absolutely love my MacBook Pro 13.3\" laptop. I am coming from windows (I have an ASUS gaming PC that I've upgraded,i7 clocked at 3.9 ghz with 16 gb RAM and a ton more). I was extremely hesitant at first from switching from windows to iOS, but i'm glad I did. The MacBook Pro is extremely fast. The bootup time is insane. It is SSD, so everything is extremely quiet compared to my ASUS. Below I will outline just a few of the Pros and Cons of the macbook Pro.\n\nPros:\n- iOS is extremely user friendly and the new iOS X makes life easy as it will convert your windows files to a readable format to iOS.\n- The Laptop is made of sturdy materials that I believe will last.\n- All SSD, which equals way faster read/write times\n- The display is amazing, the best i've ever seen\n- the new trackpad is by far my favorite. i prefer it over my mouse.\n- The keyboard is sweet. I can't explain what makes it stand out so much, but go to your local BestBuy and play on one and you'll see what i'm saying.\n- The overall quality and my personal satisfaction with my purchase has increased my productivity while taking online classes.\n\nCons\n- Price, which I will tell you below how to save money upon purchasing\n- The 13.3\" is tiny, BUT I connect it to an external monitor.\n- Apple offers horrible ROM. Way i got around this is purchasing a 1TB external hard drive and reformatting it to iOS.\n- The awesome quality makes you nervous about dropping it. If you do not have a protective case (I suggest getting the new Thule case), your MacBook Pro has a high chance of being destroyed upon impact.\n- You do not have as much customization with iOS as with windows, but it's also a lot more stable.\n\nOverall Impression:\nI am overall pleased with my MacBook Pro. My wife purchased a MacBook in 2006, and it still operates fine to this day, which says a lot. The most impressive functionality for me with MacBook Pro and iOS is the ability to text, call, and facetime from the laptop itself. Now I'm an active duty Marine and travel places where I do not always have cell phone service, AKA Deployments. The ability to stay in touch with my friends and family via iMessage was a key selling point to me.\n\nNow, for the important part: How to save money when purchasing this laptop. If you are a student or a government worker, Apple offers a discount. Seeing as I am both, I was able to save an incredible amount of money on my MacBook Pro. Best Buy will price match Apple's online offer (which I'm sure amazon will to, but this is how i did it). So Best Buy price matched it to $1,199. Then I received $50 off for being a student and registering my student email on Best Buy.com. So i ended up paying $1,150 for a new MacBook Pro. That's almost $150 off. Being active duty military and not making an incredible amount of revenue, this was a Godsend to me. I hope you guys decide to purchase a new MacBook Pro. I ensure you you will love it. even the people coming from Windows will appreciate it, as I did. Thank you  and have a great day!"}

As I'm now (technically) an adult with a professional career I have more money than I did growing up and am learning quickly that you get what you pay for (as I sit uncomfortably on a couch I got from a discount furniture store).\n\nI bought a laptop several years ago and it cost me a good chunk of change....around $1100. That thing, though, lasted me about 7 years so really not a bad run. When it started going on the fritz while I was finishing grad school I decided to go get a cheap laptop from a big box store so I didn't have to worry about my computer crashing my last semester. The computer itself is okay. Nothing to write home about. But it had Windows 8.1. Whoever developed Windows 8.1 should lose their job as far as I'm concerned. Even with Classic Shell it still was...confusing.\n\nSo at this point I've graduated, making better money, and have had awesome experiences with the reliability of Apple products in the past (my iPhone 3G is still around somewhere working....). I did some research online about the Apple laptops and realized the MacBook Pro's were more powerful but the Air's were (obviously) pretty awesome in their own rights based on size, weight, and portability. So I went to the Apple store and played around on the laptops. The 15 inch laptops were sooooo much more and I really didn't need that much screen space. The 11 inch Air's were a bit TOO small so I focused on the 13 inch laptops. I really liked the more powerful Pro and the 13 inch one really wasn't anything horribly bulky or heavy so that's what I brought home.\n\nIt's a little bit of a learning curve but I am learning to LOVE the trackpad and it's many gestures. It is absolutely perfect for daily use. It's so much quicker to boot up, load programs, and browse the internet than ANY computer I've had in the past. Since I have the iPhone it is also easy to connect the two devices and share everything between the two.\n\nIs the MacBook Pro completely customizable? Not really. Does it take a bit of getting used to when coming from a PC? Yes. Is it for everybody? No.\n\nIs it great for me and where I'm at right now? Yes. Do you get what you pay for in terms of quality? YES. Does it compare to the $350 laptop I have sitting in my living floor right now, sad and alone? NO.\n\nI had to have a wireless mouse to use with my PC because the trackpad was horrible. I'd randomly click stuff, zoom, etc. but I think I'm actually going to prefer the MacBook without a mouse."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00UGBMRQ8", "review": "This laptop is built using the best available parts, compared to some of the other laptops available from other manufacturers, it makes the competition very hard for them, many people are under the impression that Apple's computer is overpriced, but the quality of used components justify the price IMO, in fact, there are more expensive laptops with less quality out there.\n\n- Screen: IPS, best technology available for laptops, with a huge contrast ratio of 1000 according to some internet reviews (which can be reduced via software if it too high for you), very rare to find in a laptop, and monitor is also bright enough for outdoor usage, under direct sunlight may be slightly harder to view.\n\n- Design: Thin and light, when compared to other laptops in the same category, and considering it have a huge battery inside.\n\n- Battery: 74.9 Wh, that is quite large, with the current processor, it should allow for a very long time of battery life.\nThe processor and the screen brightness are the most power hungry components in the laptop. Minimizing the brightness and limiting the number of CPU hungry applications should give you a long battery life, can even go higher than 10 hours of uptime.\n\n- Touchpad: it is still very good when compared to previous model, what seems interesting in this new model is the ability to adjust the how much pressure required to register a click.\n\n- Wifi: 3 streams wireless AC is supported, the widely available for most other laptops out there is usually only a 2 stream wireless AC or wireless N, 3 streams with 3 antennas is extremely rare.\n\n- Processor: The newest released by Intel on first quarter 2015, with increase in performance and more power saving, this is however NOT a quad core processor, if you need a quad core, it is recommended that you wait for next summer for the new 15 inch model.\n\n- Other: RAM: 1866 , SSD up to 1200 MB/s , Graphics processor Intel Broadwell Iris.\nOnly heavy workstation laptops combine that kind of specs.\n\nWhat I do not like:\n\n- You have to pay an extra $200 for the SSD upgrade from 128GB to 256GB on the base model, which is unjustifiable to pay that much for only this one difference, but the extra space is needed for comfort of installing different applications or using bootcamp.\n\n- As the previous model, inability to upgrade storage or RAM, so you need to think wisely if you need more RAM or larger SSD before purchasing.\n\n- Only 2 USB 3.0 ports, if you have 1 external USB mouse and 1 external USB harddrive, you are left with no extra ports.\nNot the worst issue, but would have been more comfortable to have at least an extra port.\nYou can still get USB Hub or thunderbolt to USB adapters.\n\nFinally,\n\nThis product is the best quality of components without compromising on one component, highly recommended.\n\nIf you are not a fan of Apple products, checkout the Dell XPS laptops, another great laptop, with slightly lower specs all around, but with ability to upgrade the SSD, and the base model may cost a bit less that the Mac."}
