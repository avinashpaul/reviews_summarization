{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B01DXVKQEW", "review": "Update Feb 1, 2017 -- Samsung is scheduled to roll out Nougat for this model in the next couple of months. Unfortunately the Samsung update they released in the last week or so has severely impacted the wifi connection when it wakes up from sleep. I had updates turned off so I'm very annoyed. My tablet isn't quite bricked but having to wait five minutes for wifi to fully connect makes it nearly useless. I am dropping a star for this.\n\nOriginal review, May 2016 -- Yes, this model SM-T713 indeed has Marshmallow, 6.0.1 out of the box. If the confusing listing was holding you back go ahead and purchase, but read on.\n\nGorgeous display. I have never seen better in an 8\" format. Quick, responsive, everything you'd expect from a higher end Samsung. Battery life greatly improved with Marshmallow on this model compared to Lollipop. I'm not in love with the screen ratio, but I'm not big on watching anything but short videos on tablets so lack of \"wide screen\" format isn't that much of a minus for me. I'm giving it 3.5 stars rounded up to 4 because of the Super AMOLED display.\n\nMajor quibble though about the amount of bloat on here. I intentionally chose Samsung S2 because I mistakenly thought there would be less bloatware. Not true. It's just better quality bloat. I do not need the entire Microsoft Office Suite on an 8\" tablet. In fact, I need none of it. Plus all the Office apps are available for free as stand-alone apps, so you can pick and chose. Why saddle us with an unmovable memory hog? (Never mind, I know the answer.) Flipboard takes up an entire screen. You can press and pinch which effectively disables it but that screen is no longer available for use. That plus all the junk Samsung sticks on there are taking up over a third of the memory. Little of it can be disabled. None can be moved to SD. I have installed seven apps and no data so far and it's using over 40% of available RAM after I clean. I have at least 20 more apps to go and I'm very concerned I'll max it out.\n\nIf I had known this I wouldn't have bought it. This is not just buyer's remorse. I'd return it if I could."}

I have asked Amazon for advice as I purchased this less than 3 weeks ago. You'd think Samsung would have addressed overheating issues after previous galaxies where causing fires!!! If I find a solution I'll update my review, otherwise you are forewarned.\n\nAnother thing that is good and bad - the lights for the back arrow and whatever you call the other button to the left of the home button - it's great we have them now however they need to be easilyndimmable and able to be turned off without an app. So happy they light up now, so unhappy they're painfully bright when using a dimmed tablet in a darker setting."}

While it would be nice to have the latest model, it made little difference to me, and the latest becomes the obsolete almost immediately.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01DXVKQEW", "review": "This review is for the newer model of Samsung S2 the SM-T813 model, which is the 2016 model. The older S2 was the 810 model that was released in 2015. I owned the original S2 and loaned it to a friend because his older tablet broke. And he loves it so much that I gifted it to him for his birthday. Then, I decided to purchase the newer 813 the 2016 model for myself. Since I am a TECHIE type, I tested it thoroughly. This review is based on my personal experience with this tablet. Hopefully, this review will help you in your decision to purchase (or not), this device.\n\nPROS:\n\n1) STORAGE: So I purchased this tablet from an Amazon seller and jt was described as like new still in the box. I was happily surprised when this tablet arrived with 64 GB internal storage, not the 32GB of Internal Storage that was advertised. However, I cannot promise that all of these will have 64GB. ...however after the OS and Factory Apps, it had 52gb left. After I installed lots of personal Apps, I have 50.71gb left. Plenty left if I want to install more apps or updates on apps.\n* Note that the advertised Internal Storage space and available storage space is different because the advertised internal storage space is BEFORE the OS was factory installed, Factory Apps installed and Touch Wiz overlay. These take up about 11GB of the space. And the tablet updated with 385GB after I turned it on the first time.\nIt came with Nougat 7.0 preinstalled, then installed a large performance update. It is running very, very fast after the update and the battery life had improved some as well.\n\n2) Android OS and updates...My tablet arrived with Nougat 7.0 pre-installed. And it auto updated a minor/improvement update of 385GB. After the update, it ran very fast, seemed faster.\nFlagship Samsung tablets are supposed to get two OS Upgrades. I looked up on Google to see, some sites said yes Oreo for the 813 model, so did not know. I am hoping so because my old 810 model (2015), received 2 OS updates.\n\n3) WiFi---My WiFi Router connected immediately to this phone and it is a fast WiFi. The WiFi is super strong and I receive 5 bars around my home and it keeps the connection even in my backyard.\n\n4) Display---The display is very, very clear and colors vivid as it has very high sharpness. Reading on Internet or PDF Book, the text is crisp. The videos in YouTube are very clear as well.\n\n5) Speed and Performance---For my personal use, I find the speed and performance excellent for the things I do such as Facebook, Twitter, Internet, YouTube, Email, etc. I do not play games on this tablet yet I found all videos run very well.\nPerforms well, no lagging and no freezing.\n\n6) WiFi calling---Yes, I can make phone calls on this WIFI ONLY device using my Google Voice account and Hangouts. Note that this model is NOT a cellular device, to make a phone call, WiFi must be on and a WiFi calling app such as Hangouts or other WiFi calling apps are needed.\n\n7) External Slot for SD Card---So I installed a SanDisk 128gb Micro SD card which was loaded with my music, pictures, home videos and files. I still have 75 gb left on my SD Card. According to Gsmarena, this device holds a SD card up to 256 GB.\n\n8) Camera---I actually took some inside and outside pictures and saved them to my SD Card. The pictures (indoors and outdoors) are very OK, not professional quality, yet I am happy with the pictures, they are excellent for sending in email or even Facebook. My videos also came out well so I am happy.\n\n9) Battery life and Device Coolness---Battery life I find GOOD, and I am a heavy user of apps. I watch lots of YouTube videos, Facebook, listen to my music etc. My battery starts off at 100 percent, then after one hour of heavy use it shows close to 87 percent. This is because I am a heavy user.\n***Device coolness/Battery coolness---I use an app Widget free from Playstore called Battery Solo.

No problem as all my other devices are Micro USB except my 2017 Samsung Tab A 8.0 tablet.\n\n* Would I purchase this device over again? Yes, in a heartbeat because my Samsung Tab 2 813 model has 64GB storage and Nougat OS. It is a wonderful phone at a reasonable cost, so I recommend it. I rate this 5 stars.\n\nSince I am a Techie, if you have any questions about this device, please ask me in the comments section. And I will answer all questions about this device. Thanks you for reading my review, I hope that it has been helpful for you in making your decision about this tablet."}

The problem is, after two years it suddenly died. One day while charging it just shut off and wouldn't turn on again, or respond to charging. I tried replacing the battery, and it was responsive again, but it overheated in seconds so whatever happened to it caused the original battery to die and also caused a short in the motherboard. I'm pretty disappointed that a tablet that worked perfectly fine up and died out of nowhere after two years."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B01DXVKQEW", "review": "The Samsung Galaxy is supposed to be the top-selling Android product, that  is why I decided  to try this tablet . I have always owned an HTC, with the exception of an iphone and an iPad that I tried, which in my opinion are an inferior product compared to the Android. This particular tablet is supposed to be a high-end Galaxy product, not the latest version but none the less,  higher price tag. This Android device does not come close to the performance of my HTC U11. I know the HTC is a phone, but an Android is an Android. The specs include an 8-core processor, 3 GB of RAM and a 4000mah battery. In my opinion the overall speed of the unit barely compares to my last 4 core and 2 GB of RAM Android. When reading this review keep in mind that I have only added about 10 apps  to this tablet since  I  started using it , in other words ,  not enough downloaded apps to effect the performance at all. The battery most certainly does not live up to what the description boasts. Even as I am writing this review,  I am constantly having to correct the speech to text, which I use most of the time because it is quicker than typing and works excellent on my other Android. I could keep going, but buy now I'm sure you know that I am disappointed with this purchase. Who knows, maybe the S3 works a lot better. I didn't want to put out $500 for a tablet that I just use mainly to control my home theater. I purchase the extended protection plan with the tablet. I had the tablet checked and I was told there was nothing wrong with it, so the lack of performance is not due to a defective product. I am going to buy an HTC Nexus 9 and sell this one used, because it is past the return period. For anyone out there who is buying this tablet, I am selling my tablet along with the extended protection plan. I paid $350 + the price for the extended protection plan. I purchased it new 2 months ago. If anyone is interested, you can find it on eBay. I am not sure yet how much I will be asking for it, but obviously less than what I paid for it new. In all honesty I feel bad selling it to somebody but I was told there was nothing wrong with it and maybe I am just used to the excellent performance from my HTC U11. All though, I will say, that if you use speech to text a lot, you definitely do not want this tablet."}

My biggest beef is the horrible battery life. I use it only a few hours per day. Yet have to charge it daily.  It has way to many useless Google apps that won't let you remove or even disable.  Then there are the unwanted Samsung apps as we'll. That wasn't bad enough, they thought.  Let's throw in Microsoft's junk to bog it down even more. I removed or disabled as many as it would let me but it didn't help much.  A brand new tablet locks up or time's out while on a single page. This is the last Android tablet I will ever buy.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01DXVKQEW", "review": "I upgraded to this tablet from a 3rd generation Kindle HD Fire 7\". I bought the kindle tablet intending to use it mostly for reading with some video watching and web browsing on the side but it became immediately evident that the Kindle Fire is not a strong enough tablet to handle video streaming in high quality, and the silk browser left a lot to be desired. The only thing I was able to do was read with the built in kindle app and even that was laggy and froze up at times. I owned the tablet for less than a year before they rolled out an update that essentially bricked the tablet. So I spent months researching tablets and decided that I wanted an Android tablet, a software that I was already accustomed to using and would be able to sync easily to my phone and my computer. Originally I wanted the Nvidia shield tablet because it had the best specs and screen resolution, but it was sold out everywhere. The Galaxy Tab S2 8\" was second on my list, and I managed to get it for $249 during Black Friday. I can say, I have not been disappointed. It's an amazing little machine. It's basically a bigger version of my Galaxy S7, and at times it runs more smoothly than my phone. I can stream 1080p videos with no stutter or lag. It's a breeze using Chrome to browse the web, and I have dozens of reading apps to choose from in the Play Store, so I can find one that fits my specific needs. The 8\" was the perfect size for me. I didn't expect 1\" to make much of a difference from my old 7\" tablet, but the Tab S2 feels so much bigger. More text fits on one page and the tablet is slim enough that it doesn't hurt my wrist when I'm reading in bed. When people ask what a good reading tablet would be, I always recommend this one. It's so versatile, and I honestly think it's the best in its price range. Despite not having the highest screen resolution of tablets in its class (and something that made me hesitate with purchasing it), I can say I've often found myself marveling at how crisp and vibrant the picture quality is, so it's not at all something you should worry about.\n\nThe only minor flaw I can think of is the speaker placement. There's 2 small speakers on the bottom of the tablet, so when the tablet is turned sideways for video viewing, you're only able to hear sound from one side of the tablet and it can be annoying at times. And the sound quality is decent, not amazing, but I still enjoy watching Netflix without needing to find a pair of headphones. Just wish there were additional speakers on the top of the tablet as well.\n\nI bought a case for this tablet that I think really compliments how slim and sleek the design is. It's the ProCase in the color Black. Feels like leather, converts into a stand and comes with a free stylus/ink pen combo. Beautiful case for this beautiful tablet, I highly recommend it."}

Then Samsung pushed one of those updates to the OS you delay but never opt out of and it killed my tablet.  it still can do all the stuff it used to but the battery is useless it takes longer to charge and won't hold a charge.  Before the update, if I was frugal I could go for 5-6 days without charging!  Post update I can't go longer then a few hours.  Plus it discharges 50% overnight while in sleep mode.  It's now a $400 paper weight (it's to thin to be a door stop).  From reading the Samsung forums, it's plain to see this is a problem many users are having (it looks to me like it goes back to at least June of 2017) so that's 10 months now with NO HELP from the Samsung to fix the problem they forced on their users without any way to back-out the update.  If you have one and it's not doing this yet - don't take the latest OS updates from Samsung or you'll likely have a paper weight too.  I'll be happy to update this review once Samsung does the right thing and patches the problem."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B01DXVKQEW", "review": "I've owned this tablet for over a year now, and I would not buy another Samsung Tablet. For whatever reason, Samsung has blocked US models (via firmware I assume) from accessing WIFI channels 12 & 13 (EU) and 14 (Japan & other countries). This means that if you travel anywhere in the EU where channel 13 is used, business, home, caf, or otherwise, you won't be able to connect and that's just too bad for you.\n\nI've called up Samsung tech support and tried to sort this out, but the techs got confused between TV Channels and WIFI channels. Once I was able to educate them, they forwarded me to a \"supervisor\" who informed me there's nothing to be done about the Samsung-created limitation. Yes, the US doesn't allow Channels 13 or 14, but that pertains to broadcasting. There's no reason why a client shouldn't be able to access 13. There's no law against that. By way of comparison, my acquaintance's iphone and ipad, sold in the US, can access Channel 12 or 13 in the EU.\n\nSo, if you decide to buy this tablet, just know that Samsung has needlessly crippled it for international travelers."}

None of their support links work and based on other complaints I read, they haven't for nearly a year.\n\nYou probably won't make a purchase decision based on customer support. I knew about Samsung's reputation and just took a chance. This is just another data point. The complaints are well founded. If it works, great. If not, you wasted your money and time.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B01DXVKQEW", "review": "For me this device is a step up from my 7\" nexus tablet. I like the bigger screen with all its resolution and once it is running I don't want to look back to the nexus. However I have already encountered two disappointments. First is that although the cable looks like a usb to micro usb it is something else - an 11 pin fast charger cable. Fast charging sounds like a plus but it comes with a big minus - my LG phone and all my other tablets use the micro usb cables and are interchangable. I only need to take two chargers and cables on a trip. Now I will need to buy another. I thought about a spare charger but Samsung wants $29.99 for theirs and others don't charge fast. I feel like I've been had by a greedy company that hooked me with tablet and charges whatever the want for accessories.\nSecond, every morning when I wake up my tablet to see the news it tells me It cant find the internet. I have a good Decco router that works great with all my other devices, but the Samsung gets lost in the boonies trying to find internet every morning. I have to turn off wifi and turn it back on to connect to my router."}

It came down to either this or the Huawei Harman-Kardon Mediapad M3 (or possibly waiting for the new M5), but in the end I was persuaded by the simple fact that Samsung products are so prevalent, with so many available aftermarket accessories and, due to this predominance, a stellar level of quality; essentially I think of Samsung as the Toyota of electronics.\nFurther, I own a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and have been thoroughly impressed with the speed, quality, durability and value. Again, abundant aftermarket accessories are available, and having owned the phone for more than a year without a single performance or other failure of any kind, this contributed to my decision.\nHaving received the tablet and used it for a few days I am convinced I made the right choice. The screen is superb in terms of color saturation and resolution, such that it is an absolute joy to use doing anything, from game playing to reading to web surfing. The speed of the processor is exceptional (be sure to order the newer SM-T713NZKEXAR version with the faster and superior Qualcomm Snapdragon 650-series CPU) and never lags or hangs, and file transfers to the Samsung 128GB MicroSD I purchased with the tablet are performed with excellent speed.\nThis tablet is incredibly thin, and is actually easier and more comfortable to hold using my also bought Kaka case, and with this, in combination with the equally excellent IQ Shield glass screen protector, I feel that my Tab S2 is entirely protected, and the glass screen is a perfect fit under the case with no adverse impact of any kind.\nDue to the lower cost of the black version of the S2 I decided to buy it, rather than the somewhat more attractive grey or white versions, reasoning that with a case, which I believe to be an absolute necessity for protection of the investment, installed, the color difference would be of minimal consequence.\nI'd also like to mention that I'd considered buying a 10\" tablet, but my experience with my Amazon Fire 7\" had convinced me that a smaller tablet is preferable for a variety of reasons; it is much lighter and easier to hold, is the perfect size for Kindle and website reading (using one hand) and easy to carry in a back pocket or in cargo pants leg pocket.\nIn all, I am extremely pleased with my spiffy new Galaxy Tab S2 and the case and screen protection, and very impressed as always with Amazon in terms of quality, selection, speed of shipping and customer service."}

I have a 2012 nexus 7 tablet that is still running without any issues, which makes three send ins for a brand new device all the more upsetting. I'm going to ask Samsung if it can return it and get a refund."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B01DXVKQEW", "review": "I purchased the Galaxy Tab S2 9.7\" from a brick and mortar retailer in late 2015. Maybe it's improved since then, but here's my experience.\nWhen first purchased it was close to $600 and performed very well. I got a bluetooth keyboard and it essentially replaced my laptop. Apps ran smoothly, the features were great - I was very happy with it and treated it very carefully.\nAbout a year after purchase, it starts having some trouble coming out of standby. Pressing the power key or the home key doesn't always turn the screen on, but it's infrequent and solved by just pressing a couple more times. No big deal.\nOver the next few months it declines. Soon I'm having to press the power button multiple times to wake it up. Then rebooting it entirely. Then when it does come on, the screen is gray and static (for lack of a better description). It's lit, but displays nothing. A hard reboot fixes this for a while, I delete extra apps that might be causing any problems, factory reset, etc. I talk with Samsung techs, they suggest sending the tablet in for repair but that'll cost a MINIMUM of $200 which by then I am not willing to spend on a tablet I already paid $600 for.\nEventually it refuses to turn on at all. Nothing I do gets it to work again. The best suggestion I've gotten is that it might be a software problem... but it no longer is recognized by my computer when plugged in. So it's a brick.\nI'd think it's just my bad luck, but in researching my issue I found plenty of other people who had similar problems with the screens just... randomly no longer working. I'm switching over to a new brand for my next tablet and wondering what I should do with this brick I've got sitting here."}

Very happy with samsung products in general and as i realized over the weekend, my house is turning into a samsung fanboy's place with TVs (QLED), phones (s8 series) and tablets all from samsung. and the fridge as well.\n\nThe best part i like about Samsung products and moving back specifically about the S2 Tab is that even after 2-3 years of use (if not more), you can do the essential stuff and the speed does not really slow down in as noticable manner as I had with the iPad which i stopped using in 2013-14 after they stopped supporting facetime for the new ios on my iPad 2. And worse still, even if i didn't want to upgrade the iOS, it said i cannot use facetime as it was only for the new OS. So no choice but to give $$$ to apple. all in the name of better customer experience. nothing of these quirks with samsung. and with whatsapp video, Google Duo, don't have the need for facetime anyways.\n\nOnly improvement could be in the battery life, i feel.

The size is much more manageable than the iPad Air it replaces. It is perfect for my intended use. It's definitely a bit small for those wanting to watch movies, but the 8\" screen is plenty large for browsing the internet, reading a book, or playing a game while sitting around the house. I have a TV or computer with larger screens if I need to watch a movie or stream a show. This is mostly for checking email, browsing facespace, and playing a few games here and there.\n\nThe first thing I noticed when removing it from the box / package was how thin this tablet is. I was instantly happy that I had purchased a rather rigid, polycarbonate case for it. Like all the concerns years ago with people bending their apple phablets in their pockets, if you accidentally sat on this it's likely to bend and break. At first I was going to buy one of the thin or slim covers for it. I'm glad I chose something a little thicker both for the safety aspect and also to make it a little more comfortable to hold. Even with a thicker case on it (http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0721PG4D2/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0) it's still thin enough to fit effortlessly into the tablet pocket in my backpack when traveling."}

Impressive as it is clearly a media consumption tablet with the bright screen and great processing power. Perhaps the most dazzling feature is not what is inside but outside. This tablet is light-weight with a plastic back and aluminum bezel.\nA year later, I purchased the Galaxy Tab S3. Why? Due to the fragile build, I found that the S2 was bent after 6 months of lugging it around. Like the IPhone bending test on YouTube, the tablet has a slight bow where the sim card slot is located. The tablet is thin a bit fragile. I liked the form and design (How do they squeeze all those features into such a thin tablet?) and if I could have gotten the S3 in Gold, I would be more pleased, however, the features of the S3: larger screen, S pen and the other capabilities mean a thicker build- and with it a sturdier tablet. The S2 is great for reading around the home with its light build.  I have gotten lots of comments at work about the S2 being so thin and light but out of the two tablets, S3 is the better-and pricier option."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B01DXVKQEW", "review": "First the good...The tablet came with Android 7.0 rather than the description that said it came with Android 6.0 so I don't need to work through trying to update the OS version.\nNow the not so good...1) Per the review submission guidelines we are not supposed to describe the shipping experience so I will leave it at - not positive.\n2) After receiving the product and setting it up I registered it with Samsung. That was easy enough, but Samsung is stating that the warranty is expired. I am expecting the best, but planning for the worst and hope to not need the warranty, but the description on the Amazon product page and the order confirmation page both state that the product has a valid manufacturer warranty.\n3) Now about the product itself...From my reading I got the impression that one could move apps and files from the 32GB of internal storage to a micro-SD card so I purchased a high-end and relatively large SD card to save internal storage space. I followed the tutorials provided by Samsung to move apps to the SD card, however, only one of 20+ apps so far has given me the option to move it to the, at this point, expensive and useless SD card. This has resulted in over half of the internal storage already being allocated and I only set it up two days ago. I am remaining optimistic that once I begin downloading other file types such as images, media files and documents that I'll be able to download them directly to the SD card with out needing to do double work by downloading them and then needing to physically move them from internal storage to the SD card.\n4) Finally in regards to RAM...I did some comparisons between different tablet models and manufacturers and I was fairly confident that for the size limitation of wanting a tablet that fits the hand and so needing something in the 8\" range, which is very difficult to find in newer models and manufacturers, that I was getting one of the best \"under the hood\" set-ups for the price point and size constraint. However I'm a little skeptical, because without really running anything on the tablet I'm consistently utilizing over 50% of the 3GB of RAM. It makes me wonder what performance will be like when multi-tasking, or running resource intensive tasks like streaming video? Only time will tell, but from the bit of research I've done the articles say that Android 7.0 is supposed to really positively impact multi-tasking and RAM usage."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B01DXVKQEW", "review": "It'll sound like I work for Amazon, but I don't. I have had Kindles for years. Love them. When it came time to upgrade from the last one, and thinking I want to also use the next device - instead of a laptop - for email, browsing, etc. I did a lot of research and landed here. Should have continued to research. Main beefs:\n(1) Not impressed with the andoid OS. Not even a little. Buggy. Forces you to install apps left and right, when simply using a browser would be fine or even better. Buttons mean different things depending on the app.\n(2) Reading what's out there, I was given a clear impression the Microsoft tools like Word and Excel are free on this device - nope - you can view, but you can't edit. When you call to figure it out, Microsoft and Samsung point the finger at each other, and that's when they don't want to charge you for tech support.\n(3) this is not a Samsung issue, but while on the subject of Microsoft - Outlook for Android is really poor. It was developed for a 4-5 inch screen, and I am holding a 10\" device...\n(4) Charge time, using the charger that was provided with the device, is unbelievably long. I think you need to charge an hour to get 45 minutes of completely standard use. Kindle is FAR better."}

It works incredibly fast, had Mircosoft Works/Excel/PowerPoint, plus I can still access everything I bought on Amazon. I haven't had any issues at all. If need be, I could always get microSD cards to add on to the storage. The sound and picture is phenomenal, better than Kindle and the camera works better as well.

It would be better if it was a stock Android experience and there was quite a bit of junk installed that took sometime to disable. The battery life is not great but not terrible. On the positive side, the screen is terrific and the tablet seems to perform well in everything I have tried so far including several games. One problem I ran into is that screen casting doesn't work with Chromecast devices (though the Chromecast option in all the apps I tried DID work). I bought a third party MHL to HDMI adapter with charging capabilities and that works well, but its still not as convenient as being able to mirror the screen to a Chromecast device.\n\nThe SideSync app from Samsung was a surprising benefit to this tablet. It allows you to manage notifications and mirror the tablet's screen on a PC complete with mouse and keyboard integration. I am using it to assist with app development and its working great.\n\nIf the tablet continues to work well I will be very pleased with this purchase overall."}

Wifi and 4G are a tad slow.\n\nThe main problem is that Samsung removed MHL OTG for this 2016 version of S2 tab without informing us. (The 2015 models of S2 Tab had MHL OTG support) This means that if you break your screen (VERY likely) then you cannot connect to an external mouse and HDMI monitor to backup and extract your data. The screen replacement costs $350 (a new device is more worth it).\n\nI am sure Samsung has an in-house adaptor+drivers+software to help access the phone's contents, but they will not help. I went down to their service ctr to ask for such assistance so I can get a few precious wedding shots, but they refused to help at all. This will be my last Samsung product.

Anyways...\nYou get what you pay for. I believe I spent around $249 for this last year on sale and do not regret a single penny.\nFor what they cost now, if you're thinking about a versatile tablet with more than enough power for 95% of us, do it.

I do not stream a lot of video or watch films but when I have I was impressed with the resolution and the processing power to reduce jitter and judder. It is relatively light and easy to hold. I did not want a bigger screen.\nA couple of negatives. The battery seems to drain visibly quite quickly unless one of the lower power modes is selected. This is my experience with Samsung devices that I have had in the past, e.g. three to four phones. I do not know whether this is common to Android devices in general. One side effect (glitch) is that when one of the power saving modes is selected, push emails seem to be disabled. So the only way to check whether there are new messages is to launch the relevant app each time. This is not good.\nI read quite a lot and thought finding an epub reader with a built in dictionary would be a breeze. I liked the ibooks app on the old iPad that I was using and assumed there would be one equivalent and easily available. After installing and trying several different ones I settled on eReader Prestigio mainly because of the associated dictionary, but I still prefer iBooks."}

Plenty of ram for games 3 gig and 32 gig storage expandable by card. Runs fast as he'll and is perfect for everything. This is the one if you want. I tried to use my 9.6 inch high perform as nice kindle but they never upgraded the operating system...sad as nothing new would work even though it was really overpowered. I even was going to buy a new hdx 9.6 kindle but they had none and were not getting more. So my cat has my hdx 9.6 and I have an S2 and just bought the gold color s2 for my wife with this one. So another cat gets get a toy in the 7 inch kindle. I really want to stay kindle but much easier to just go with strait Android and get updates. I hope someone reads this and it helps them."}

I decided to try Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 8 due to dissatisfaction with my Kindle fire  HD 8. I have had the Samsung for about three weeks and I am dissatisfied with this product also.  I hate the constant ads everywhere, even on main screen. Very few apps are ad free. I have googled how to get rid of the ads and tried every fix I could, but they still show up. I did not have this issue with the Kindles. The keyboard doesn't type the keys you press most of the time, unless you type very slowly. I play a very popular game but the sound in the game doesnt work well. I know it is a game issue but it means the game doesnt fix issues with the Samsung easily. There is no help section.  Ex.  The only way I could figure out how to use the camera was to Google it. Overall, I am disappointed in the tablet and would not recommend it for everyday use."}

I sent it in for repair on Jul 26,2017.  On Aug 7th, 2017 I received an email offering either cash back less 33% depreciation or an exchange unit.  I asked for an exchange unit on Aug 8th, 2017 via email.  I followed up by phone call on Sept 18, 2017 and was told they would ship one as soon as their exchange department received my unit from their repair facility.  I followed up again on Sept 24, 2017 and tried to get a commitment as to when a replacement might be shipped, and got a stern dressing down that the status was \"IN PROCESS\", and that there was nothing else they can do.  It's now Sept 10, 2017 over one month after I responded that I'd like the offered exchange, and still nothing.  I USED to be a loyal Samsung customer, but they will not be receiving any further of my business ever.  I recommend you consider a company that actually provides customer service in support of their products.  Samsung definitely doesn't.\n\nUpdate 1: I followed up again on 9/11/2017 and this time was referred to a different number, which didn't answer, and I left a message.\n\nUpdate 2: 9/12/2017 I just received an email from Samsung indicating that my replacement Tab S2 would be released to the carrier within 2 business days. Revised the title of this review from \"Non-existent\" to \"Poor\" Technical Support."}

Amazon has made the decision to go for the low price tablet market, and they finally made enough downgrades in hardware (camera, for example) and software (I  was much happier with the email and keyboard functionality on my 2015 Fire) to make me look elsewhere. Plus I  knew the Fire would never replace my laptop. I think the S2 may be able to.\n\nI bought the Samsung keyboard,  which is great. I remove the keyboard from the case when I don't need it, and I turn off the S2 Bluetooth to save power. I'm trying out the free Wave accounting software to replace QuickBooks for my one person business.\n\nThen there's Prime content. The Amazon shopping, Kindle, and Prime movie apps all work great on the S2.\n\nMy only complaint about the S2 is that the touch functionality is very picky, but that may be a matter of me adjusting to it.

I mainly bought it for the size. Unfortunately Samsung doesn't have an 8-inch version of their S3 tablet with a faster processor and a bit more memory. I find 9.7 inches a little too close to the size of my 11-inch laptop. I want something I can easily hold in one hand and fits in a bag smaller than a briefcase and this does the trick, yet it's still powerful enough to take care of a spreadsheet or document on Google Docs. It's capable of doing split screen, but I really don't need that feature. I would strongly advise a good case and screen protector. I've already killed one of these in a drop."}

Thanks Motrolla / Lenovo.  also, I took a star off because samsung disabled the android feature to combine the internal memory with the sd card. On my Motoralla G5 phone, with the same version of android, you can combine the internal memory with your sd card. Again, cudos to Motorlla / Lenova, Samsung you need to get your act together. PS, the Motorolla G5 phone is only $300 fully unlocked with 4GB of ram, 64GB internal memory and expandable SD card slot, excellent battery life. You can even buy the Amazon version of the Motorolla G5 phone for less than $300. Excellent phone.\n\nI also have the older samsung tab 4. that version is junk. not enough ram and not enough ram and not enough internal memory.  This tablet version is much better."}

EVERYTHING works perfectly on it.  And it's incredibly thin and light, AND FAST.  I considered buying the S3, but I actually prefer the micro-USB because I have so many cables and devices that use it.  I have a Note 4, and I have found little use for the stylus, so using this tablet without one (as opposed to the S3) is not a loss.  If you've bought your fill of four-year old refurbished stuff for cheap (and gotten junk)  Do yourself a favor and get a REAL tablet.\n\nI was careful to get the 2016-release model with Snapdragon.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B01DXVKQEW", "review": "I do like my Samsung Galaxy Tab s2. Its features are what you would want with any tablet. However, it has some glitches that are puzzling, even confounding.\nFirst, the good:\nIt is beautifully thin. I have never seen such a thin tablet. That makes it delightfully light to handle. I almost didn't want to put a cover on it. However, if you order one of the Fintie covers this does not add that much weight or bulk of it but still protects well. The tablet upgraded immediately to Android 7, Nougat and so it has the latest OS (although it will be antiquated by the time I post this). The tablet is not overloaded with bloatware that takes up a lot of the 32 gb space and so that is a plus. The 9.7 display is just right for reading and viewing. The display is sharp in definition and is very colorful and responsive to videos being played. The display has 4:3 aspect ratio so you can read digital publications in portrait orientation without it looking squashed. That aspect ratio may not fill the screen with photos that are taken in the landscape orientation and you will have black bars on top and bottom even in the landscape orientation.\nThe Bad:\nThe touch screen works well enough in most cases and responds to the touch adequately for web sites, applications and publications. However, inexplicably with some web pages and some electronic publications the touch screen is unresponsive. For example, every time I go to Google news and I want to open up a news item to read I have had to tap the article link up to 6 to 8 times before it responds and goes to that news report. Sometimes my taping causes the screen to jump sideways to an adjacent web news category instead of opening the news report. Additionally, if I am using my finger to scroll up or down there is a great tendency for the screen to jump sideways instead of scrolling up or down. If I try to deliberately scroll up/down by going slowly the screen will start wiggling sideways as if it is desperately trying to jump sideways to adjacent web pages. The screen will also do this with certain publication reading apps. I never had such a sideways sensitivity with a tablet. This certainly did not happen with my previous Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 loaded with Android 5.1 OS. I do not know if this is a glitch with Android 7 or with this tablet. Also, the battery life stinks. If I charge it overnight and use it on and off the whole day the battery will wind down to 15% between 6 to 8 PM.\nStill, for the reasons given in the good paragraph I am happy enough with this tablet and I hope it will serve me well for a couple of years before I have to replace it."}

Take a length of thread and slip in under the outside edge of the slot and work it back towards the hole. At that point, it should be possible to lever it open. Worked for us."}

I have a dual-band router, and I have several devices (3 tablets [two Samsungs and a Kindle Fire HDX 8.9], 3 Kindles [original, Paperwhite, Voyage], 2 phones [both Samsung], 2 laptops, even my desktop, which has wireless) that recognize one or both of these bands. Nothing was recognized with this thing. The toggle flipped on, then flipped back after about 5 seconds. Yeah, it may have a nice screen (my Galaxy S7 Edge has a nice screen, and my wife has a first-generation Samsung tablet which is still going; I even have the original Google Nexus 10, made by Samsung, and only gave up on it recently, after nearly 5 years, when the battery would barely hold a charge). Yeah, it may be fast. But I wouldn't know, because Samsung ships defective units that don't get past the set-up screen. This is an obvious, preventable error--the phone should not ship in this condition--and this may be the last Samsung tablet or phone I buy."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01DXVKQEW", "review": "This was one of my best buys ever.  I've had it now for about 18 months and am still totally impressed with the Tab S2.  Here are the things that impress me the most:\n\n1. Super high-resolution screen. Though I own the 8\" model I can see everything crisp and clear with vivid colors. The resolution here is the highest you will find for any tablet and it's worth it.\n\n2. Quick processor speed. This tablet is very fast in accessing apps, e-mail, calling up photos, music, etc. It's more like a computer than the typical tablet.\n\n3. Super slim design. This is about the thinnest tablet you will ever own. It's weight is negligible and it passes the \"back-pocket test.\" By that I mean that it fits in a man's pants back pocket. Though an 8\" screen the outside dimensions are about what you commonly find for 7\" tablets.\n\n4. Upgradeable Android. One shortcoming of many tablets is that they eventually become obsolete. You cannot upgrade Android and eventually the apps you have will not run on your old version of Android. I haven't needed to upgrade yet (I'm running Marshmellow) but like to know that I can.\n\n5. Superb integrated keyboard and leather case. No the keyboard/case is NOT included and NOT made by Samsung but by Fintie. For under $30 you can have a great leather case and keyboard (the case can be used and fits perfectly even if you do not tote the keyboard around with you). I am a touch typist and can use this keyboard for fast typing. Though small it's like a real keyboard with keys that depress and was made just for the S2.\n\nWhat don't I like:\n\n1. The cost. This is a very pricey tablet relative to others that are out there. Yet I think the investment is well worth it because this is NOT a typical tablet but much better."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B01DXVKQEW", "review": "First major problem occurred less than in a year. Orientation stopped working. We had to drive 40 miles to the nearest support. They just wiped out all our data and reset to firmware. After that, Android updates stopped working giving \"Update failed\" all the time and giving the suggestion to use \"Smart Switch\". I googled the issue and realized that this is a quite common problem. Installed Smart Switch on my Mac and tried to make an update. Update stopped in the middle with a failure notice and a suggestion to use the \"Emergency recovery\"!!! Don't need to say that Emergency Recovery failed as well, as well as \"Device Initialization\". Updating USB drivers in \"Smart Switch\" menu resulted in other error messages. Now the device is a useless brick.\nIn conclusion, you can use this tablet, if you don't care about security updates, and that somebody can steal your personal information, hack your email, bank account and so on. Don't try to use any of so called \"software\" from Samsung to fix the issue. It was my third and the last bad experience with Samsung devices.\n\nUpdate. I managed to make device working by flashing firmware by Linux open-source program Heimdall using the firmware from the third party web site. Still, don't think it is normal that to make an update you need such expertise or go to the service center in 100 miles."}

The third one is the charm!\n\nI bought this as a light-weight option to lugging along my 10\" Note and Kindle Paperwhite for travel. I will be using it for Internet (WiFi) access, backing up digital photos, and reading on the Kindle app. I added a 32 GB memory card for the photos. The beautiful screen is big enough for everything I need to do on the road. In fact, I think I won't be using that Note too much any more. It's got some wonderful features that I learned about by watching videos on YouTube. For example, if you want to conserve the battery life and don't need color, you can set it up to toggle from color to black and white by giving the main button a triple click. This is so well-suited to my purposes that I'm very happy with the purchase.\n\nINITIAL COMMENTS: I'm waiting for the post man to deliver the replacement for the tablet I got on Monday, and hoping I have better luck this time. Following the instructions that came with the tablet, I fully charged it before I even turned it on. It charged completely, so I turned it on and started using it. It has a beautiful screen and I was looking forward to having it as a light-weight travel device. On Wednesday, after light usage, the charge had only dropped to 66%, but I thought I'd go ahead and fill-er-up before I gave her a good work out later in the day. I noticed it had stalled out at 98% charge. Since I was charging with the tablet turned on, I turned it off and it did finally get 100% charge. I unplugged it and didn't use it. When I came back several hours later, it wouldn't start. It got to the \"SAMSUNG\" logo where it simple slowly flickered and didn't respond to any attempt to get it past that. I contacted Customer Support and tried everything they knew to revive it, but nothing worked. Hence, I wait and hope that I've not made a mistake in choosing this device."}

The MHL capabilities that let you output to a TV/Monitor via an USB to HDMI cable does not work. Even if you get the cable from Samsung that they themselves list as compatible on their website, it will not work. From what I've read in technical discussions, no one can tell if it is a hardware issue or something in the new version of Android. And this happens on the second generation of these but apparently not on the first. Hopefully it is the software because that can be fixed. Hardware, not so much.  Everything else is great.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01DXVKQEW", "review": "I ordered the newer SM-T713NZKEXAR Tab S2 8.0 in June 2017 and love it. I haven't bought a Samsung product in awhile (last time was the original Galaxy Nexus phone and didn't care for the build quality - plastic, etc. It worked fine but felt kind of cheap. This tablet, while also plastic is bolstered by aluminum side rail which makes it feel great. The back which is plastic is a warm rubber mat feel that isn't slippery like a smooth plastic case and feels great. So overall a 9.5 on the build quality and feel.\n\nThe form factor on this phone is amazing. Thin. Light (when compared to anything else out there, even after a year and a half since release). The screen is very nice, and I like the 8\" size, a lot bigger than my Nexus 6P 5.7\" phone but not so big and heavy I can read books and the web with it. Overall form factor a 10.\n\nA few nit picks.\n1) USB C please! Other tablets from late 2015 had USB C. Now my phone has USB C and this has the old microUSB port and I have to lug around two cables. On a flagship tablet this should be leading the pack not following.\n2) While this has small bezels, they could be smaller (but this thing is nice regardless).\n3) Ummm - did I mention this thing rocks?\n\nSamsung, you have upped your game, nicely done! Highly recommended.\n\nRecommend a Skinomi glass screen protector, it fits great and makes the screen flat with the slightly raised side rail, making it more comfortable to hold, not to mention the increased protection.

The battery is OK, I plug the charger in at night and so far one day of usage has only taken it down about 50%.  I probably use it 1-1.5 hours a day, maybe more.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01DXVKQEW", "review": "Just to get this out of the way, this is a 100% worthy purchase.\n\nPros:\n\n1.  Screen- the 8 inch super amoled is beautiful and bright.  I have no issue with viewing this indoors at 20% to 30% brightness even though most other tablets require at least 50% to be near as good (my Ipad Air 2).  As anyone who follows tech knows, Samsung makes the best screens in the business.\n\n2.  Speed/Performance- This tablet has a mid-range Snapdragon 652 octacore SOC and 3gb of ram.  I was not expecting this type of speed from this tablet.  It opens apps almost immediately and multitasking and switching between apps has been a breeze.\n\n3.  Speakers- This tablet comes with 2 bottom or side firing speakers that I was expecting much from but they are loud without distortion but they don't really provide much base.  Still, when in the shower playing music I have not issues hearing the songs.\n\n4.  Upgraded to Android 7.0 as soon as I turned it on.\n\n5.  Standby time is much improved in this android tablet or android version.  Not sure which is the reason.  I had a Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 and the standby time was horrible on android version 4.4.4.  I could charge it and leave it unplugged overnight and the tablet would lose 20% of its charge.  This tablet however has only lost 1 to 3 percent overnight.\n\n6.  Samsung's game mode- Samsung, once you take the android 7 upgrade, provides their game mode features which allows both performance boost for 60 FPS a second gaming and high quality resolution or you can choose other performance to help the game or conserve battery.  There also an option to lock the recent and back buttons on the tablet to keep you from accidentally hitting them while deeply immersed in a game.  I love this feature as I use to go nuts on my Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 from accidentally hitting buttons while deep in a game.\n\nThere are many more Pros to this device that I don't want to go into, it's android so it is very flexible.\n\nCons\n\n1.  4:3 aspect ratio when watching movies.  When viewing netflix and others you lose so much screen real estate unless you maximize the video which blows it up and then you lose detail.  This tablet is great for games, web browsing, reading and productivity but movies are a little bit of a miss.\n\n2.  32GB internal storage- Even though this tablet allows for expandable storage, keep in mind that Samsung's flavor of android as far as I can tell does not allow for adoptable storage (ability to turn you SD card into system internal storage by formatting it as such).  I installed all my games and social apps but had issues where I ran out of storage.  I went in and moved apps that allows for storage on the SD card which helps some but 32gb is still too small.  I bought the newest 32gb Samsung Pro SD card (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XWZ7L1Q/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_28) and have only been able to move roughly 6GBs of internal storage to it.  Also, this is a tablet coming straight from the manufacturer with no telecom carrier stipulations so why tie the buyers hands with putting apps on the tablet that cannot be uninstalled.  For instance, what if I don't use Microsoft Office or many of the Google Apps that come preinstalled?  Yes, they can be disabled but they cannot be uninstalled which takes up valuable limited storage space.  I looked for but could not find the mythical 64gb variant out in the wild.  If you want to tie the buyers hands why locked apps then please provide a 64GB or 128GB version of this tablet, at minimum.\n\n3.  Battery life: Standby time is exceptional as listed above but in usage this tablet really drops from 100 percent to the mid 80s rather quickly.  I may get 5 to 6 hours of screen on time but that's highly doubtful.  I am going to do further testing.  I might be spoiled by the Ipad and the fact of the larger battery capacity of the larger tablet."}

It has excellent resolution and display color.  Good WiFi performance  60Mbps on home 2.4GHz channel. It streams movies from my home network very well. Performance is very good with games and Office 365 apps  Word, Excel, etc. I expanded the memory with a 128GB uSD card and have ready access to cloud-based storage, e.g. Dropbox, OneDrive, and Google Drive. I loaded it up with apps, pictures, a few movies, and a ton of Kindle ebooks, Audible audiobooks, and music.  I was able to readily connect and use multiple Bluetooth devices: Microsoft foldable keyboard, Microsoft mouse, and Bose earbuds.\n\nSample workflow using this tablet in lieu of my laptop: While traveling, I can import RAW images from my Canon DSLRs SD card into the tablets uSD card using an OTG card reader and ES File Explorer. I create the same file structure on the uSD card that I would use in my home system. I can review and edit/convert the RAW images with Photo Mate R3 or Adobe Lightroom. Im particularly happy with how fast RAW images are rendered and viewable on the tablet. I can share the generated JPEGs by (as one example) copying them to a USB flash drive connected to the tablet with an OTG cable.  At home, I can transfer the whole lot to my PC network using WiFi, USB cable, or by removing the uSD card and using a USB 3.0 card reader (fastest). This workflow works very nicely for me and is almost as efficient as if I were using my laptop.\n\nThis is my fifth Android tablet and easily the very best and I am now using this more than my iPad Air 2.  Needless to say, I am very happy with this purchase."}

Most apps cannot be stored on the external card. After reading a review about whether or not upgrading was worth the additional money, I took the plunge. The Samsung S2 32gb tablet is the best tablet I have purchased. This is my fourth. I purchased the 8 inch because it is comfortable to hold for reading. The clarity is spectacular. After transferring my info, the tablet still has 20gb that are free. In addition, transferring the apps can be done automatically. My one complaint was the email setup. I have 5 email accounts and I had to set them up through Outlook, not the usual email app. I had to go through the setup procedure more than once. Other than that, this is one great tablet. Well worth the money."}

I purchased an IPad 2 ($710) at the end of March in 2011 and it still works today, although the battery doesn't last as long as it used to, and I get \"A problem has occurred on this web page\" on a lot of web pages that I look at. I have looked at the current IPad's that are offered today and am not really impressed with any of those. After a lot of research over several weeks, and Amazon offering of $399 instead of 499, I bought the Galaxy Tab S2. I purchased an Elemsy 9H screen protector, and a MoKo protective cover for the tablet to ensure that the bumps and occasional drops wouldn't destroy the tablet. The tablet has quite a few features that I didn't expect to see in the settings. Device Maintenance is a feature that allows you to clean up the cache and all of the other junk that's clogging your tablet up and you can also choose if you want to Optimize the tablet for longer battery life. I have found that the longest battery life on the ultimate power saving mode is 64 hours at 100% charge, but I find that I am charging the battery almost everyday. The Sound Quality and Effects can be customized using the included Equalizer that you can adjust manually or choose various settings such as \"Rock\" or \"Pop\".\nAnd playing Lady Gaga's \"Born this way\" video on YouTube sounds excellent. You can even choose the \"Concert Hall\" effect feature in the settings under \"Sound\". The display is not as sharp as I would like but I have changed the default picture to an abstract from the ZEdge app and all is now looking pretty darn good. BTW, as soon as you connect this tablet to WiFi, it updates to Android version 7.0 Nougat. From reading about the new OS, there are more enhancements going on in the background than the foreground of what you can see. I do like the \"Quick App Switching\" feature as well as the \"Split Screen\" feature. Hopefully it will last 3 or 4 years before I buy another one."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01DXVKQEW", "review": "I felt obligated to write this review as I had a difficult time trying to find a decent, small Android tablet since the Google Nexus 7 2nd version. Let's face it, from a user experience (UX) perspective, most Android tablets in the market, without sugar coating it, are just plain bad in comparison to iPad's. Scrolling is jittery, which basically makes everything else redundant. The Nexus 7 2 was in my opinion a very good Android tablet at an excellent price point. The Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8 was also fairly good but mine (which I had for 2 years) started to lag after about a year or so of use, despite not having very many apps. I believe the \"bloatware\" was the main problem (which seemed to get worse after the system upgrade to Marshmallow), so I was dead set against purchasing another Samsung tablet.\n\nI'd seen the Samsung Galaxy tab S2 8\" last year and baulked at the price, having not been completely satisfied with my current Samsung Tab S as already mentioned. But last week I smashed said tablet in frustration when it started lagging again, so needed to buy a replacement tablet. Again, Samsung was off the list, but when I did my research, there just weren't any 7\" - 8\" tablets in the market that I couldn't guarantee I wouldn't throw against the wall again. So while walking through an electronics store, I saw the Tab S2 8, at a very reasonable price point, as the Tab S3 being launched soon. A quick flip through some of the apps and a look at some web pages, I was surprised at just how smooth everything was. It's the closest Android tablet to an iPad that I've used and looks exactly like an iPad Mini.\n\nThe bloatware seems to have been reduced. I purchased a version with Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) out of the box and 7.0 (Nougat) was delivered a few days ago. I'm extremely pleased with this tablet. It's very light and comfortable to hold, and was surprised to find that it fit in my back pocket. Apps load quickly and the user experience is extremely smooth. The screen resolution is superb.\n\nMy only negative comment would be that the speakers are positioned at the bottom of the tablet (not on either side as with the original Tab S8) and the sound quality is not the best. It's certainly not bad, just not on a par with the previous version. And the output from the speakers is quite low, but youll probably be using headphones so this shouldn't be a problem.\n\nThere hasn't been any issues with the speed of the tablet since the upgrade to Nougat, in fact it seems smoother. Id highly recommend this device to anyone looking for a small Android tablet. I believe its currently the best device out there from a price / quality perspective.  4 out of 5."}

I use it to my trip to Montreal from Boston and it worked perfectly well, so it DOES HAVE a built in GPS unlike Apple tablets and it works. The map I have used is Here We go. I am planning to use it on my trip to France in a few days with a Sygic map that I have bought a few years ago and have used in many European countries with my old Nexus 7. Will update after the trip. You could of coarse use your smart phone, but the screen is too small for planning. Recommend as a tablet and with off line maps.\n\nWe are back from our trip to France. We were driving thru Burgundy, Alsace, and Champagne using GPS on this tablet and Sygic maps. All worked perfectly well.

However, I'm thinking of returning mine because I can't stand the yellow-tinted screen. It seems crisp and clear in store, when watching a 2 minute trailer or demo video, but when you have it in hand and watch an hour long programme, the blacks are not quite rich enough, the colours are either too yellow/blue/off and there's a constant green/yellow tint to people's skins that I can't get rid of. There is no way to change the colour on the screen via the device itself (except for 3 presets that don't help at all), so I downloaded an app from the Playstore to change the screen colour, but it's still not good enough. The green/yellow tint prevails.\n\nI've Googled the issue and apparently it's a common Samsung screen problem, apparently due to the AMOLED screen used by Samsung. It's not a swatch of massive green across the screen (that is an LCD issue), but rather that everything looks...too yellow or green. It's just annoying. Comparing that with my Nexus 5X phone (Google) or Moto X screen, and Fire HD 10, there's a world of difference in true-colour display. And seeing that I bought this primarily for media and entertainment consumption, I can't keep staring at a screen I can't stand.\n\nUnfortunately, at this price range, the options are limited. I tried the Samsung Tab A as well and that had such obvious pixelation that it also went back. I bought the Fire HD 8 from here, and the screen was even MORE yellow, so went back. I'm not a fan of iOS, either. So where does one go from here, unless willing to accept subpar electronics? The search continues..."}

As a matter of fact I have been using it for about 4 hours while charging.  When i started the battery was at 40%.  Now it is 36%.  Other than the battery it isn't a bad product but it seems slow sometimes.  Samsung is not as good as they used to be."}

Unfortunately, I've received a lemon on this twice (not from the same Seller), but I'm getting another replacement rather than a refund because I love its features so much. I know that the ones I received which had the screen freezing up on me were simply \"lemons\" which can be expected in any product line.  I am waiting for my replacement, and I am sure that I will be delighted with it the same as so many other customers are!  One of my nephews is a \"computer geek,\" and he assures me that this Tab S2 is one of the best Androids on the market.  I especially like its size - it's listed as an 8\" but is wider than my 8\" Samsung Galaxy Tab 4. They are measured on the diagonal, so these are just a bit wider and a little shorter then my 8\" Galaxy Tab 4."}

I'm a security consultant and I can tell you this is a MUST for all devices that has access to your email and browsing history.  My main point is this: It doesn't matter if you implement strong unique passwords for all your accounts if you leave just one device that can be used to reset all your passwords!\n\nFor my phone I have an iPhone and my wife has an iPad with Touch ID and they work at about 99.7% of the time.  With my S2 this is more like 50%.  Even when I dedicate recording all five fingers with just my right thumb (seriously Samsung, why limit it to just 5 fingers??) and I give it a full 360 degree run around, with quite possibly every range of touch I could apply it for it STILL fails me, locks me out having to wait 30 seconds or have to type the whole password... no thank you.\n\nIn recent weeks Samsung announced the \"face\" un-lockable S8 which it's in so many ways very cool and easy to use but now we're finding that S8's can be unlocked with a picture... this tells me how much QA Samsung puts into their stuff as well as how little they care about security implementations.  By all means a very speedy tablet that can do tons of things that my wife's iPad can't, but I won't risk my security for this guy."}

I've had it for eight months and don't regret the purchase for a moment. I highly recommend it, in fact. I've used it almost daily for a variety of things (writing, chatting, games, watching movies, listening to music. In fact, I'm writing my review on it, right now.) and haven't had a single issue. I've kept multiple apps running in the background and have yet to experience any lag. Same with keeping multiple tabs open on my internet browsers. Very sharp and clear display. Extremely thin and lightweight. Battery lasts me all day with periodic use, and most of the day with constant use. Since my phone is also a Galaxy, the connectivity between the two through my accounts saves me a lot of back and forth. Now that I have a reliable keyboard case for it, it's my go-to for on-the-go work or writing, as it's still small and light enough to fit inside a medium sized purse.\n\nIf I had to give a con, I would say it's the SD card slot. It requires a small tool (which comes with it) or a paper clip, if you don't have it handy, to eject the SD card tray. It makes it slightly inconvenient to switch between SD cards, but it's definitely not what I would consider a hardship."}

We keep the unit on the charger 100% of the time and use the tablet to watch Netflix in the kitchen.  Twice now our tablet has refused to boot up.  After checking on-line we see a great deal of posts with other people having the same problem with Samsung tablets.\n\nThe battery is fully charged.  We know our charger is working since I can test that it does indeed charge when I plug it into my phone.  We have tried many on-line recommendations of holding the power button on for 1 minute, to holding both the power and volume key, to.. sigh..... seriously... why don't you make us all perform a rain dance at the same time??\n\nIn December when this problem first appeared it took a couple of days of repeating the many listed steps you can find on-line before the unit would magically boot up.  Here we are in March 2017 and the unit has decided to not boot up again.  I am taking it back to the store.  I STRONGLY RECOMMEND DO NOT BUY, there are other options out there that actually work reliably!!!\n\nI am baffled why this Samsung product even has this problem in the year 2016/17, but for the price it is unacceptable that the tablet for some odd random reason decides it is going to be difficult to turn-on."}

When I contacted Samsung, I was told that they do not provide warranty for tablets sold in Amazon.  Then I contacted BLINQ to claim the problem I was having and they just washed their hands saying their warranty was only for 30 days.  Finally I decided to take my tablet to a Samsung Service Center a, when they opened the tablet they found that the problem was the charging port flex board, it was NOT a Samsung part.  I contacted again BLINQ claiming that they refurbished a tablet with cheap and non-original parts, they just said that they receive too many tablets per day and they do not have control on the repairs that are done.  I told them they should take ownership of this problem but they keep saying that they only cover the first 30 days.\n\nSo watch out if you buy a refurbished tablet form BLINQ, you may be getting a cheap repair on your tablet with no warranty but the fist 30 days. I ended up paying $185 for the original part, in the end way more than if I have purchased a brand new tablet with 1 year warranty form Samsung."}

Perfect for net surfing and the fingerprint sensor is incrredibly convenient for logging into sites. Chrome doesn't integrate with fingeprint readers, so I basically never use chrome on this tablet.

Not BETTER, just fashionable.\n\nMy Galaxy Tab had the better screen resolution, expandable memory, ability to switch between apps at a much faster pace, flawless multitasking while the iPad was limited in number of simultaneous apps, pre-installed Microsoft Office, and the ability to play videos without WiFi. These are just to name a few. I won't even get started on all the customization options at my fingertips while the iPad could do Nada.

Keep in mind that I have all Power Saving options turned on. I took it to work with me to see why it would do that (I've been in IT for 33 years). But first I had to charge it. I had it charging for 3 hours, and it was only at 10%, and there was a red X on the battery. I let it charge for a total of 17 hours, and it only made it to 56%. Anyway, I contacted Samsung, and sent it in for repair. I got it back last night (April 27th). It was back at Factory Default. It was at 68% a 9pm last night. This morning it was at 28%. I had nothing installed at all. No files or music copied. I took it to work with me this morning. I had it plugged in from 7am to noon. It went from 26% to 56% in 5 hours.\n\nI contacted Samsung. Spoke to a rep. Gave her my previous case#. I told her that I wanted a replacement. She said that she needed to transfer me to another dept. So 45 minutes on hold. Next thing I know, I had been disconnected. Luckily, she called me back on my cell phone. She wanted me to troubleshoot. I refused as I did troubleshooting on my last case, and that this is the exact same problem... so she got me in touch with a \"tech\". He wanted me to send it back in!!!! I said \"So that you can keep it another 2-3 weeks and send it back still broken\". He said YES. Let alone, I couldn't hardly understand him. I told him to send me a new one. NOPE!!! He said that they do extensive testing on these before sending them back. I told him that their test sucks because it came back in the same condition as when I sent it to them. He refused to send me another one even though this is a lemon. I told him to send me whatever he needed to and I hung up on him.\n\nI then called T-Mobile (where I bought it as I need Broadband). They are replacing it!!!\n\nI got a new tablet the other day... and I love it!!! I got so sick of Apple's proprietary crap. And that anything you want to add to the iPad, you had to use iTunes or buy a 3rd party software. And the iPad has no flexibility. You buy a 32gb iPad... you are stuck with a 32gb iPad. Cannot increase the storage capacity at all.\n\nSo... with an Apple, if I want to copy music over to the iPad, I have to make sure it is in the MP3 format otherwise, you can't even copy it over via iTunes. OK... not a big deal as most music files are this already. But what about video's?? Oh... let me tell you about that!! With an iPad, it has to be MP4 x264. Not all videos are this format. You have quite a few video formats (AVI, WMV, MP4, MKV). To watch a video on the iPad, you have to convert the file over to the MP4 format. Now... here's the real pain in the ass part of an iPad. Pictures!!! With music and video, you can just drag and drop the files over via iTunes. Pictures?? NOT EVEN. Here's what you have to do... create a folder, and copy the pictures you want on the iPad to the new folder. Then go into iTunes, and you have to Sync that particular folder.\n\nI got a new Galaxy Tab S2. It's 32gb... however, I can add an SD card to increase the storage. I happened to have a 64gb SD card lying around at work... I threw that in there. So now I have 96gb of storage. And the neat thing... I can copy my music or videos over, no matter what format they are in. I installed VLC media player from the Google store.... which was free, and this is what I use on my computers as well. VLC plays anything!!!  Pictures??? Just drag and drop!!! Easy!!! Oh... and now the really cool part. I bought a $5 dongle that plugs into the power port... and it allows me to attach my thumb drive to the tablet. Take the 96gb that I already have on the tablet... add in 128gb thumb drive... lots of space. I can put a bigger SD card in if I want. Oh... and with my thumb drive attached, I can watch movies directly from that instead of having to copy the file over to the tablet. How simple!!!"}

Android software works great.\n\nOriginally I gave this 5 stars until I found a serious flaw with the system.  There is an option on the Samsung device which allows you to create a \"guest\" account.  Awesome feature for those who want it, however there is no way to disable or turn this feature off without rooting your device and voiding the warranty.  So if you secure your account anyone can just create an guest account and use the device at their will. This is especially frustrating as my children have figured this out and create the \"guest\" account and use it to their hearts content without permission or supervision.  Even if you set up a password for the guest account you can just reset the account at will and start fresh without needing any password.  It is an extremely frustrating flaw in my opinion."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B01DXVKQEW", "review": "The Samsung Galaxy S2 is my first tablet and I like it. You can read all about its virtues elsewhere. I got it mainly to capture notes I make on the go. I absolutely hate having to transcribe my handwritten notes later into a computer. The handwriting analyzer is very good at accomplishing that task. However, there are some serious shortcomings I wasn't aware of as a first-time tablet buyer.\n\n1. You can only have one application open at a time!  Yes, they advertise split screen, multi-apps, but it's mostly not true. It only applies to certain \"selected\" apps, like email and google maps, not the apps I am interested in, such as Acrobat and Google Docs or Kindle Reader and Word.  This restriction makes it virtually impossible to read a document and write notes about it.  I might not have bought if I'd known that.\n\n2. Tons of bloatware come pre-loaded on the device and cannot be removed. This essentially means Samsung offers about 30% less available memory than you think you're getting.  Maybe it's their way of forcing you to buy supplemental SD memory. Be aware.\n\n3. Wifi-only tablets don't work in cars -- only where there's Wifi.  That's not a problem at home, but anywhere else, you are at the mercy of whatever Wifi is available -- slow and clunky at school and public places, unsafe in hotels, privacy-robbing in stores, unstable and unsafe in airports, none at all on the road.  If you get a 3G tablet you have a cellular microwave connection everywhere, but of course you then have to pay a monthly fee to a carrier like Verizon.\n\nConclusion: Despite many attractive features, a tablet is not anywhere close to being a substitute for a full-sized computer. I thought tablet  technology was more advanced than it actually is. A tablet is mainly for consumption of information (e.g.,movies, pictures, games, and shopping), but not for production of content, which typically involves synthesis of information from several sources.  Since you can only have one app open at a time, you can't even look up a reference while you're writing. I need to  make marginal notations even to  read a novel (and if you've ever tried to do that on Kindle reader, you know it's not practical). So this \"one app at a time\" restriction is a potentially dealbreaking constraint."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B01DXVKQEW", "review": "The T713 tablet is fantastic.  The display is bright, sharp and fast.  Making it an ideal choice for drone pilots (my requirement).  However be aware the tablet doesn't play well with the most widely used drone apps  DJI GO and DJI GO4.  When the USB cable is connected between the tablet and DJI remote control while everything is powered on,  the display starts flashing messages so fast you cant read them, basically locking up the tablet until your either reboot or unplug the cable.  Another issue i discovered about the T713 was it wouldn't connect to my AT&T Sierra Wireless hot spot, which I've owned for years and never once had a connection issue from hundreds of various devices.  As it turned out my hot spot was configured to allow both WPA and WPA2 wifi connections, for whatever reason the T713 didn't like that and i had to reconfigure my hot spot for only one of the two encryption methods.\nIn summary T713 appeared to be exactly what i wanted in a tablet but came up long in BUGS.  None of these problems existed on the earlier model T710, so I'm hoping they will be resolved in the near future or I'll just wait on the S3 due out Q3."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B01DXVKQEW", "review": "The screen is beautiful and hardware quality and performance is good.  But...it comes with a lot of software that can't be uninstalled.  Since you can't get rid of the programs, you have to do a lot of hunting through menus to turn off all their irritating notifications, clear away the screen space they waste, etc.  After a while the MS office software refuses to load if you don't sign up for their service, and it can't be removed either.  Battery life is also porr.\n\nThese aren't disasters, but the point of a tablet is convenience and this is supposed to be a premium product.

I purchased it from a different seller, a well known auction site that begins with E. The price was $50 lower than Amazon's and the seller provides a full 1 year parts and labor warranty, as well as 60 day no questions asked return.\n\nAnyhow, I LOVE this tablet. Though I have only owned it for one day, I think it has the most brilliant colors of any tablet I have ever used or tried out, bar none. It is fast and smooth with no lag whatsoever. I can't say enough good about it. The battery life seems fairly decent, though it is hard to say for sure at this point.\n\nUPDATE 12/11/2017 - Been running it for 11 months now and I am still loving it. Battery life is good and it is just as responsive as the first day I got it. If you are looking for a decent tablet for a reasonable price I highly recommend this one. The price is much lower than an Tab S3.\n\nI bought it to replace my 4 year old Asus TF300T and I find myself wishing I had done it several months ago when the SM-T813NZKEXAR was first released. Not that the Asus was a bad tablet. It served me well for as long as I owned it. But it was beginning to show its age and the display quality doesn't hold a candle to the Samsung.\n\nThe only con I have found is the need for a special tool to remove the SD-Card.

It is such a great small format tablet, I find I have left my laptop in my closet at home and haven't used it in months.  I made the investment to buy the Bluetooth keyboard for it and while small, it's a great add-on.  I can even print from it to my home printer and the screen and processors are awesome.  I was heartbroken when I thought it was dead.  It wasn't charging.  It kept rebooting.  I mournfully ordered the S2 8.0 hoping it could replace by S.  The S2 is a great small tablet.  Plenty of power.  Screen is amazing.  It's a great small tab.\n\nHowever, I just couldn't get past the change in the screen.  The widescreen format of the S 8.4 allows for streaming full screen.  The S2, with its 16:9 screen, shows streaming content with letterboxing.  It makes the viewing area noticeably smaller.  With today's world of Netflix, Amazon and other streaming trends, viewing area is important.\n\nThe rest of the specs are spot on.  It's fast and the screen is beautiful ... I just didn't like the 16:9 format.\n\nUnfortunately, it doesn't look like Samsung is going to make another tablet with the same screen shape specs as the S 8.4.  I know some folks don't like it, but I do.\n\nI'm happy to report I was able to fix my S 8.4.  Seems my Samsung OEM charger was bad, causing the tablet to struggle charging.  New charger, and a factory reset on the tablet, and we're good as new.  The S2 is a great tablet.  If that's your choice, it's not a bad one.

Last year's model, but very nice and everything works. While you still have to manually purge some of the RAM and storage space sometimes like with the Tab A, and there's only about 4000 mAh on the battery, this device does well to conserve memory, space, and energy.\n\nYou're not going to find a nicer tablet for less unless another on-brand competitor (LG) makes it.\n\nPersonally,  I don't like off brand tablets, and after my recent review with a budget tablet, I think it's sade to say you won't find anything better than this device at a lower price point.\n\nThere's no cellular network access on this device, but that's fine with me. I can use the mobile hotspot feature on my phone to connect to the Internet that way.\n\nGetting a micro SD card is always recommend even though there is 32GB of internal storage. 3GB of RAM is also modest.\n\nConsider this if you need an Android tablet that does everything from reading books on Amazon Kindle to playing Minecraft. Although, if you spend all day doing the latter, consider getting an Anker power pack or the Samsung power pack.\n\nAlso not included but highly recommend is the Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 8.0 Book Cover and one of those retractable pens with the soft rubber stylus on them."}

Customer assistance was responsive, shipped both ways on Samsung's dime .. came back repaired and no sign of any problems 4 months later ... of course no problem is the best, but if the company stands behind the product and repairs it then I am satisfied.\n\nUpdate:  Unfortunately I have to downgrade from 5 to 1 star .... perhaps temporarily as I am hopeful my issue will be resolved.\n\nAt about the 6th month mark the screen started acting up as 1 half of the screen would periodically malfunction and show a alternating pattern of light and dark grey lines or simply show half of the previous page.  At first infrequent and resolved by restart,  the problem progressed until a point where the device could no longer be used.  The device was very gently used.  To me a device of this price, from a respected manufacturer,  failing like this in so short a time is unacceptable.  Now the hopeful part.  Today, my first opportunity to contact Samsung support, went pretty smoothly as the device was verified as still under 1 year warranty and the tech advised me that as long as the device is not 'liquid or physically' damaged that they would repair it free of charge.  As the device looks like it just came out of the box and has never been near water I am hopeful this will work out.  Unlike many manufacturers, Samsung (to their credit)  provided free UPS to mail the device to their repair facility.  I was quoted 9-11 days turnaround.  Of course I wish that this had not occurred, but so far Samsung seems reasonable about their responsibility to the customer and as we all know 'stuff happens'.  At the end of this repair effort I will update again and if I have a working device I will return the review to 5 stars as I think post purchase support is very important and often lacking.\n\nA great tablet .. has everything most people would need in a tablet  .. the screen is excellent ..  bright and clear ... well equipped with the octa core processing and  3 GB of RAM .. wireless ac is a big plus and absent on most tablets.\n\n  I use this device primarily for web surfing ... video netflex and local files ... music stream and local files ... blu tooth to a headset .. email  ...  everything works ... performance is excellent.\n\n I grabbed it when it dropped to $250 a few weeks ago, but I see that it is no longer available from Amazon.  Look around as I see it is still available from other sellers and other sites."}

Today I am returning it to the local seller.\nWhy first it is slow. Deadly slow on internet site access and downloads  It is intermittently responsive to touch. .\n\nI loaded up my Office365 and kindle reader and go set for serious work. Just could not even read comfortably, because the touch screen did not respond. Hard to read.\n\nI have never owned a tablet. I have used iPhones for things most people use tablets for, such as reading books. I have a 6s.\n\nSo, I do hot have experience with Android. This computer is running, 6.0.1 Marshmallow. Pretty if a little garish. Confusing to me. I downloaded the 185 page manual, but since it was slow, it just was not going to do the job.\n\nThe processor runs at 1.4, not up to 2016-2017 specs. Also the WiFi is like a/b/c/g, not A/C. I did a little research and on reviewer on line who like the device, said, even though the processor was slow and the device uses some sort of Samsung interface puts an overhead on web interactions he was surprised at how well it worked. He also mentioned that compared to Apple, Samsung under powers their devices.\n\nSo two days ago I ordered an iPad pro from ATT. I needed to add a service, and I will pay over many months and I would have like the smaller size, and the beautiful screen, I have come to trust and rely on iOS. I am sorry I did not like this beautiful, truly inexpensive jewel. Unfortunately, it is not jewelry, but a machine with defined work tasks."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B01DXVKQEW", "review": "I bought this tablet to replace an iPad that is being reclaimed by my school.  It's similar in size and weight, but the battery is about 20% smaller, so I had to do some research on increasing battery life before I was happy with it.  I was able to either disable or delete many apps I'll never use, and, not being into games, the resulting battery time is turning out to be fine. I also make a point to close apps when I'm going to be done with them for the next few hours, rather than leave them running in the background. I read a lot on my tablet, view a few movies or TV shows, email and text via Chrome, and usually find I need to recharge about every day to day-and-a-half.  Charging seems to take about 4 hours.\n\nThe tablet is very much like a large version of my Galaxy J7 phone.  I really like my phone, so the tablet was a breeze to use, right off the bat.\n\nIf you tend to use a lot of battery-eating apps, you'd probably be unhappy with this tablet, but otherwise, I'd highly recommend it."}

Samsung is my favorite android device and after doing much research I decided to go with this tablet. I was looking for something that was compact and easy to carry around. 8\" is the perfect size along with the 32gb of storage space. Unlike may other tablets I've seen, they either come in 16g or 64gb. In my opinion, 16gb is too small to accommodate and 64gb is not very necessary unless you have a lot of things that you intend on storing. Before I actually started liking this tablet I actually ran into battery issues with my first two tablets. I was having issues with the battery not charging and battery staying at 0% or 1% for a very long time before  it would finally start charging, but even after it started charging the charging speed was quite slow. It would take up to 3-4 hours to fully charge the tablet to 100%. It didn't seem right. At that point I was almost thinking about getting an iPad because my boyfriend was convincing me to get it. I was reluctant to give up and decided that I was going to give it one more shot. Third time's a charm right? Well my third tablet is working great and no issues with the battery. It is charging quick like a regular phone. I also love the smooth matte back cover. I can finally say I am happy with my tablet."}

Initially when I first got it I was impressed with the looks and build of it. It's very thin and the display is sharp. After using it for 5 months a few things have really bothered me enough to give this only 2 stars.\n\nFirst, the WiFi loses connection repeatedly. It will lose connection, come back for 5 seconds, lose it again and reconnect. It does this ALL THE TIME. I thought maybe it was an issue with my router but none of my other 5 devices in house exhibit any issues at all.\n\nSecond, the battery life is horrendous. Seriously this thing is lucky to get about 5-6 hours of good use before it reaches 10% battery. This is coming from a full charge too.\n\nThird, the Samsung bloat. Way too many useless apps that you can't remove without rooting or the debloating tool. Why Samsung insists on doing this is beyond me. Very annoying.\n\nIf you're in the market for an Android tablet, my recommendation is to look elsewhere. Unfortunately, there aren't many options out there in the Android space which is sad because really there should be."}

Never owned an apple phone and never will. I had the note 7 it was an almost perfect phone. But we all know what happened there. So now I own a s7 edge. Almost as good.  I have a lot of Android movies so I figured I would get this tab s2 9.7 tablet to view them.  I was really let down.  I'm being as honest as I can.  The screen is to dark to see everything on the movies unless it's a bright scene. If it's one of movies mostly filmed at night well forget it.  No matter how much you turn up the brightness it don't help.  Doesn't matter what setting you use cinema ,photo, or adaptive the movies are dark. As far as the rest of the different programs great screen plenty of brightness. This tablet is fast and it comes Microsoft Office apps great tablet  !!!!!!!!! Update!!!!!!!!!  I was streaming the movies when I did the review.  I finally got around to downloading my movies to my tablet.  Oh my god what a difference. This screen is awesome.  I have to say yes samsung has caught up.  Put my Apple iPad pro 12 inch side by side with my tab s2 put the same movie on both.  The samsung totally blew the iPad away. No comparison not even close.  The iPad looked washed out compared to the s2. The blacks are black. Without true black you can't have a realistic screen. I'm very impressed. Note!  Don't look for good sound because it horrible.  Ear phones a must for movies.  IPad pro  kills the tab in the sound department."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B01DXVKQEW", "review": "Being very well satisfied with last years' model (SM-T810) I figured this would be the perfect gift for my significant other, and I fully believe I would have given a 5 (I love it!) rating.\nHowever, when the item arrived it was obvious the retail packaging had been opened, as well as the protective thin foam folder the tablet itself was in. And when I pulled out the tablet, I found a small dark brown smudge of foreign material on the back of the tablet and the serial number sticker appeared to have been tampered with.\nNow since this was a gift arriving the day it was to be given, I figured, let's see if all is ok and turned it on. Unlike my first Tab S2 the battery charge was very low (again telling me it likely was not 'new' as advertised.\nThen a message pops up stating 'An unauthorized factory reset has been attempted' which definitely wasn't something I expected. Then it asked for a Google username (email address) and password, so I attempted to log in with mine, only for it to pop me back out to the prior screen with the same message.\nThis is when I called Samsung Support to see if the tablet had been registered for warranty purposes. So far it had not been registered with Samsung, but was told to do a factory reset to 'as new' condition it would have to be sent to Samsung. Oh yeah... send it in and wait a few weeks before I could give my S.O. her gift? Nothing doing!\nSo I returned it immediately.\nNOTE: Credit where credit is due...\n1. Although this issue was beyond the control of Samsung as the manufacturer, Samsung Support was VERY patient, understanding and as helpful as possible under the circumstances.\n2. By return shipping the item the same day as I received it, based on my Amazon correspondence it appears the credit may be processed before the original charge hits my credit card account. (Hopefully!)\nHOWEVER... this does NOT absolve Amazon for the item not be 'New' as advertised condition, which is why I did NOT ask for a replacement item and will never buy any electronic device from Amazon again.\nNo, I wouldn't have decided that after only one issue, but two other electronics I purchased in the last 6 months were defective upon receipt so I figured 'three strikes and 'you're outta here!'"}

The dual quad core processors is lightning fast. It is very dependable. The tablet I used before this one was a 2nd gen nexxus. The nexus was the best of its kind. And it is lightning fast and it has perfect picture quality. But it is dated. It is 4 years old. After having a galaxy tablet crash on me a few years ago and a galaxy phone crash on me I said I would never own a galaxy again. This galaxy s2 was the last chance I was giving galaxy to redeem itself and it did. It has surprised me in a great way. But it, it is worth the money."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01DXVKQEW", "review": "This tablet has a very high-end feel, like all the other Samsung products I've owned since the S3. I'm glad I got the 9.7; I wanted this mainly for reading ebooks and surfing the web, and I was torn between the 8 inch and the 9.7 inch. For some technical books, the text is borderline too small. I mean, I could read even smaller text with the resolution this tablet has, but doing so would be uncomfortable. Yes I know I can adjust text size in reader apps, but I'm merely explaining how the 8 inch would definitely be too small for technical books. For such books, an 11 inch, with this same display ratio, or perhaps even the ratio of the Pixel C, would be excellent. This tablet is lightening fast. Apps install super fast, navigation is butter smooth with absolutely zero stutter or lag. And this is thin, really thin. These things are thinner than the tablets they used in Star Trek: The Next Generation. We're definitely in the future now. I had considered the Pixel C before buying this, but without an SD card slot, I really can't justify paying the amount of money Google wants for that tablet."}

I stand by my 5 star rating for the product but changed it to 1 based on my subsequent experience with the company. Briefly (to the extent possible), my unit froze and I returned it for repair in January after being told I would get it back in 10-14 business days. When I called in early February, I was told (on the 12th) that it couldn't be repaired and that I would receive a replacement in 24-48 hours. Wrong. I was to get a phone call for me to approve the model. That phone call never happened. From that point on I was told 3 times that a replacement would be sent in 10-14 days. I would estimate that I made 15  (more like 20) phone calls, exchanged several emails, wrote a letter to corporate office - I did get a call back - with assurances that the replacement was to be sent. I will skip the nightmare that dealing with tech support by phone was. Bottom line, I received the replacement during the week of April 9."}

It's pretty snappy performance-wise and even with less screen real estate, the size, to me, is perfect. The discussions about poor battery life in some of the other reviews hasn't been an issue for me, but will always depend on how you use your tablet. With a good screen protector (I use ArmorSuit), and a good case (using a Unicorn Beetle), I think this S2 will do the trick."}

So I contacted Samsung and they sent me a shipping label to have my tablet fixed, and in the email it states to include accessories such as charger and cable.  I did.  Two weeks later I receive my tablet...sans charger.  I contact Samsung and I am told it will be 10 business days...so a whole month without my tablet being able to be used.  I asked that my warranty be extended to compensate me for their mistake.  So far nothing.  I am not optimistic.  This most likely will be my last Samsung purchase after years of Samsung TVs, phones and tablets."}

It holds charge long enough that I simply can forget to charge one night and still be fine the next day. It may be pricier than other models, but if you actually compare this tablet to standard smartphones today it surpasses most smartphones when many tablets do not. Just because you have a big screen, doesn't mean it will work better unless you invest in the processor and ram that will improve performance. My only issues with it would have to be based on limitations of apps themselves, but if I try comparing a tablet to an actual desktop or laptop it will never live up to it's expectations. It is super light, and paired with a keyboard ( I bought the Logitech type S keyboard case) It becomes an invaluable piece of technology at your disposal for easy note taking in class when a laptop becomes too bulky, or a easy to carry and use tablet in a workplace you have to walk around a lot.\n\nPros\n- great Performance\n- good screen size\n- good battery life\nCons:\n- It doesn't have same functionality as a laptop"}

This is not a Prime item and I was told by Amazon to expect delivery in 7-10 days.  Instead, I got the tablet in ONE day, even before the accessories arrived via Prime!  As a Samsung phone owner, I loved this tablet from the moment it came out of the box.  Slightly smaller but MUCH lighter than my old eepad, smooth looking, VERY FAST, and easy to work with.  Marshmallow transfers accounts and apps from another device if you want, giving you a chance to uncheck any you don't.  That made \"moving in\" very fast since I have things the way I want them on my phone.  I've only had the thing a couple of days and I will update if I have any trouble in the weeks ahead, but if you are an Android user or you're sick of paying Apple prices, this is a really wonderful tablet.  With the bluetooth keyboard this will replace my laptop on travel, and it's so light it will also be my only e-reader."}

The picture quality improvement is very noticeable. I used the samsung switch app to slide everything over from my old tablet to my new one, worked like a breeze. There was no work or stress to move all my photos/apps/kindle/everything. The sound is so much better now that the speakers are on the bottom and not the back. I am trying to get familiar with the application management - it seems more complicated to move something to the sd card/device. It's definitely faster in every way than my old Tab 4 and that was pretty quick.\nI got the gold color - it's cool and also a gold samsung cover. Their cover is something to get used to, it's a bit floppy and seems backwards. I'll get over it.\nOh, and the omoton screen covers work perfectly!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01DXVKQEW", "review": "This tablet is the best I've owned to date which really doesn't say much since I've only owned one other tablet in my life which was a Asus Transformer running a Tegra 4. Obviously, this tablet is superior to that and even the iPad Air 2 in many ways.\n\nI am a medical student and was seeking a necessary tablet to use as a combination study tool I can take anywhere. I must say that this tablet has the functionality for studying medicine which is currently unmatched by Apple unless you spend a million dollars for upgrades or the iPad pro. I was between semesters and on a limited budget so I chose Samsung and here's why:\n\nCost for memory - Like I stated earlier the Tab S2 is superior to the iPad Air 2 in many ways, one being memory. At the same price point, you get literally double the memory (32GB vs 16) which is a major deal for me because I require tons of files, pdfs, and videos that use a bunch of space. Yes you can use cloud services like One Drive and Apples Cloud but they both are slow, touchy and not the most reliable. Either way, you get cloud services for both. Samsung comes with 100GB of space for One drive and more over, if you are a student, chances are you get some type of cloud service through your school for free anyway. I spent $16 for a Samsung Evo+ 64 GB micro SD card that brings my total space to about 96 GB. For Apple conversely, to just get a 64GB version of the iPad, you have to spend $100 extra dollars for the base model. Even still, the iPad is not expandable.\n\nScreen. The screen is brighter and more colorful than the iPad Air two although they both have the same resolution. However, this is the only area that the iPad has an edge over this Tab S2 which is that the iPad screen has built in Palm rejection similar to the surfaces. This means you can use a stylus on the screen without your Palm interfering with the input. This may seem like a possible deal breaker but Android OS has a counter to that; fact that iOS's most popular note taking app, Notability, isn't all that great. Plus Notability costs money and if you want to sync Notability notes between your iPad and Mac, you will have to pay for two separate licenses. Inkredible is available on Android exclusively and is completely awesome. It disables the part of the screen your palm touches which can also be customized. Perfect for my needs and combined with Samsung's split screen multitasking feature, can take notes from the lecture slides (use Xodo) while Jamming to music on Tidal (which is also superior to apple music) Best part is, Tidal Premium is 5 bucks a month if you are a student. Apple is also beginning to be shady with their billing. For instance, if you were to download Spotify, Netflix, or Tidal through the apple store, they will attach a monthly \"Apple Store Surcharge\" making your 9.99/mo Netflix cost 12.99/mo or whatever they decide to charge in addition.\n\nRAM: 3 GB is perfect for loading large files and moving them around. The iPad only has 2GB and I have seen people get a little annoyed when loading thier ipads while loading big files especially moments like class getting ready to start.\nProcessor: Fast. No lag period.\nMy colleagues often have Apple buyers remorse once they see how much better work flow is on this compared to their iPad. If you are in between the two, this one is better unless money is no object for you and want to get a iPad pro.\n\nOther thoughts: I recently obtained an Air 2 free through my school and I must say the Samsung screen is obviously superior to the Air 2. The blacks on the Tab look like it does when the device is powered off: Completely black. The blacks on the Air 2 glow with a maroonish tone. And actually the colors have a reddish hue to them on the iPad. And no it's not night mode. When I activate that, the screen turns SUPER red. Which i think the ipads \"reading mode\" may be easier on the eyes than the samsung but maybe its just visual preference. The screen is also not nearly as bright or colorful. With that being said, the cameras on the iPad are nicer on both the front and rear facing cameras and the speakers are louder than the Tab S2. I use a blue tooth portable speaker when I want to jam so this doesn't bother me. The iPad also is extremely heavy compared to the Samsung. The heavyness makes the Air feel more solidly built but I know the screen isn't as durable as the Samsung's gorilla glass. However, although the Tab S2 comes with a 2 AMP charger, it doesn't offer fast charging like it's cell phone counter parts. The Air actually has a 2.1 Amp charger but seems to charge at the same speed as the Samsung. I have an 813 version so it comes with a Snapdragon 652. It feels a lot faster than the A8X which I found leggy in comparison coming out of the box."}

After reading all the great reviews on the Samsung Galaxy S2, with trepidation I finally bought one and never regreted it. Since the day it arrived, I have been absolutely delighted with it. The screen resolution offers everything the iPads did, and it has performed flawlessly and without any glitches. Others have complained about the \"bloatware\" Samsung loads on these tablets, but honestly I don't agree with that at all, seems like just the right mix of apps for me, with tons of space still available. I especially like that I have the option of directly accessing files on my external flash drives without having to upload them somewhere first (although you do have to buy a USB adapter for that). All in all, I feel this tablet does everything iPad does as well or better, costs much less, and so far no sign of sign of any glitches.

If you research the Galaxy S2 you will find that there is a big difference between the old 2015, 710/810 version and 2016, 713/813 versions. The processors are completely different. In fact, I've read benchmarks that put the newer 713 tablet at about 25% faster than the 710 based on that major difference. (Although it is possible that some of the OS changes from 5.1 to 6.0 may optimize the speed more too). Also, I think the new processor draws less power increasing battery life a bit (but I'm not totally certain on that.)\nI saw people comment that they were getting the old model instead because of price. I thought people should know that paying a little less for the old 710 could be a bad idea because the 713 is much better.\nWe plan to buy the 713 S2 once my daughter has saved enough allowance to contribute.

Had this tablet been capable of being wirelessly (Qi) charged, it would have been nearly perfect! The micro USB port on other devices I've had seem so fickle ... not lasting nearly as long as the useful life of the rest of the device. Another complaint I have is that the USB port and the headphone outlet are both on the bottom of the device if it's held in portrait orientation. Consequently, I end up turning the device upside down (with the \"home\" button (hardware) and the \"back\" and \"all open app\" buttons (software) on the top). A little awkward. In landscape orientation, this is not a problem, but landscape is not always my preference.\n\nOther than those complaints, I really like the Tab S2 8\". It's larger than my last 7\" tablet, and it's amazing the difference the extra inch makes, yet it's very portable.

I looked at Ipads first because I really wanted FaceTime, Apple's cutting edge video chat app.  Then I heard about Hangouts, the Android answer to FaceTime. Hangouts is great and works well (you can even use it to video chat with Ipad owners) so I saved about $400.00 by purchasing this tablet.  FULL DISCLOSURE: My pricing was based on purchasing a IPad Pro 264GB 9.7\" version for $800.00.  Unlike Samsung tablets, IPads do not have SD card slots.

Screen quality is one of the best, very comfortable to read and can be bright enough with direct sunlight. Camera is average with enough light, otherwise it's useless as the software considerably over processes the pictures.\n\nThe screen ratio is great for reading and browsing, but you may not like it for any 16:9 videos as you will have black bars on top and bottom.\n\nI haven't experienced many lags as thats most likely due to better software optimization from touch wiz. It handles games quiet well, but might feel a little warm with power hungry games.\n\nIf you can get a good deal, I would definitely recommend it."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01DXVKQEW", "review": "I, typically, dislike using extreme exaggeration but I just had to let all of you Amazonians know that this is without a doubt the best tablet that I have ever owned and I've owned quite a few (i.e., iPad mini, iPad 2, iPad 4, Galaxy Tab 10.5, just to name a few). I went back and forth on whether or not to get the iPad mini 4 or this and I am soooo glad that I decided to go with the Tab S2 (don't get me wrong, the iPad mini 4 is a great device but the iOS ecosystem is just a bit too restricted and dependent on iTunes for my taste). No, the battery life is not as good as the iPad mini 4, but it, honestly, is pretty good and it charges much faster than any of the other Galaxy Tabs I have, previously, had. The Tab S2 is so thin and light that you forget that you are holding it sometimes. I primarily use it to catch up on the news (reddit, flipboard and espn), eBooks, and audio books and the processor handles everything that I throw at it. And yes, this is the model that came with Marshmallow pre-installed. Other than my cell phone, this is, definitely, my go to device. All of this said, if you are on the fence and trying to decide between this and an iPad mini, then get the iPad mini 4 if you are an iOS ecosystem person or get the Tab S2 if you are an Android ecosystem person. BUUUUT other than the battery, which I've stated is not an issue for me, the Tab S2 is the better all-around tablet, in my opinion."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B01DXVKQEW", "review": "I didn't buy this through amazon -- it was a gift. I use amazon A LOT, so I wanted to add my thoughts on this device.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Tab S2 (SM-T713) 8.0 inch Review:\n\nThis is truly a fantastic tablet and I am very satisfied with it!\nI am coming from a Google Nexus 7 2013 tablet, so this tablet has really been a breath of fresh air. The Nexus 7 was showing its age a bit with how slow it was getting (especially with YouTube) and also how unresponsive it was becoming in regards to recognizing touch inputs in the middle of the screen. Shame! I really loved that device.\nThe Tab S2, however, has been a terrific upgrade. It has taken some getting used to, but it has been worth it and I definitively recommend it for anyone looking for a smaller (8 inch or smaller) tablet.\nPros:\n- Its quick and very responsive. I primarily use this device to browse the internet, do some light research, use YouTube, Reddit, and do some light shopping. So, I am not running the latest graphically intense android games on this device and most apps I use are not as processor-intensive as others available, but for what I use this tablet for it has been responsive and very quick. Everything works really well and in terms of its processor, there is nothing I believe is lacking.\n- 3gb RAM. This is a lovely addition and allows more background apps and more chrome windows! Haha, the RAM pairs up nicely with the processors and adds to the general responsiveness of device\n- THE SCREEN! Oh my goodness. The Super AMOLED screen is gorgeous with rich and deep colors that make every image pop. Watching YouTube videos have never looked better and images, gifs, and memes on Reddit look great. It took a bit for me to get used to the 4:3 aspect ratio (coming from the Nexus 7s 6:9), but honestly it works great and makes reading articles, stories, posts, and internet pages a lot easier.\n- The battery is great. I don't have problems with how long it last. I can usually get by with 2-3 days of light use with it, with 2-3 hours each day. I charges quick as well (compared to the Nexus 7), so thats really nice.\n- Micro SD card expansion slot. This is really, REALLY nice. I know a lot of devices have this now, but Google is stuck in the Middle Ages and haven't really made the jump to allow this feature, so having a tablet have this is awesome. I put in a 64gb EVO+ in there and it works great and adds a whole lotta storage to the device.\n- The wireless range is MUCH better than my old Nexus 7. Im not sure if this is the standard now, but boy oh boy, its nice to be able to still get a good connection to our router from the furthest reaching spots in our house.\n- Its super thin and super light. Both things are great and both add to the general futuristicness (word) of the device.\n- The build quality is top notch.\nCons:\n- Bloatware. This is the BIGGEST con for me. I understood that there would be bloatware when buying this Samsung device, so I guess I knew what I was getting into. Its not terrible and horribly intrusive, but its there, it updates itself (the Samsung app store and all the pre-installed apps that come with it), and every so often it gets in the way. But honestly, after putting in a 64gb SD card in the device, installing an icon pack and a new launcher, the look and feel of the device can be tailored to your liking, and thus the bloatware is sort of hidden. Ill wait a year to root the device, so I can uninstall the bloats ma bloats.\n- The protruding camera on the back.  Now I don't use tablets to take pictures, never have and probably never really will. So the camera on the back protrudes a fair bit out of the back, and really just becomes this protruding (to use that word again) thing that I don't really use. Sort of mares the Tab S2s super thinness.\n- The speakers suck. Like really, really suck. Theyre poorly placed on the bottom of the Tab S2 and watching videos in a horizontal fashion really leaves a lot to be desired. I was spoiled by my Nexus 7s speakers  they weren't THAT much better, but the very fact that there were two speakers placed either side of the device meant sound was distributed much better.\nWell thats my two cents on this device. Overall its really a phenomenal device that is held back by a few shortcomings (hence the 4 stars). In many ways it is a HUGE step up from my Nexus 7. Samsung makes quality products and I might just be sticking with them for future tablet purchases. That screen. Hmmmm that screen. Its gorgeous."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B01DXVKQEW", "review": "Lovely tablet. Fast, lightweight, most everything an Android tablet should be. Strangely, I find the screen to be a little too \"warm\" and its colors unnatural compared to my old Google Nexus 10, although they are more saturated. But in daily use I don't notice it. All in all, a nice replacement for the Nexus 10 for me and a very good unit- especially for the price.\n\nI like the camera, a lot. I've had a Nexus 5 and 10 and this camera beats the pants off them. Colors are more natural than my aging Sony point-and-shoot digital camera, and low light performance is superior to all of them as well. Its picture quality looks roughly similar to my sister's old Galaxy S5 phone.\n\nReviewers online have complained about the battery life. I don't notice, really. I religiously plug it in at night, and it's basically good for a day of Spotify plus some gaming or what have you.\n\nPros: I put in a 128GB flash card. Nice! You have to manually move your apps to the external card, however, which is a bit of a pain but not too bad. Alrso, this is a very thin light, and powerful tablet. Cons: Speakers are weak, and they're all on the same side of the tablet. The Nexus 10 had better sound, but then again it wasn't stellar. It's a skinny little tablet, after all! There's also a good amount of bloatware on the device, of limited utility. I don't care too much but it was nice on the Nexus 10 knowing that its bloat was minimal."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01DXVKQEW", "review": "I read a lot of reviews, got way too many unsolicited, well-meaning opinions, and decided on this tablet.  I had a great one - but time did a number on it.  My five-year-old Toshiba just couldn't keep up.  I compliment myself on showing restraint.  I patiently waited, watched the tracking, and put it on charge within minutes of its arrival.  I carefully went through the set up and registration, and was then off on uploading apps.  My first impressions include - well, the fingerprint sensor is amazing.  What a way to lock/sign-on!  The overall response is great.  I ordered the tablet, the micro SD card, and case at the same time, and they all arrived in the same box.  Right now, my only gripe is the micro SD card.  It installed easily, but everything I have downloaded has gone directly to the internal storage.  I wish there was a way to choose where each download went.  I can't believe it would be that hard for the cpu to access the card.  Another con:  I once got a less expensive tablet, and within days after the warranty expired, the charging port stopped working, fell apart, beyond what my local tech could repair.  No charge, no computer.  Now I have the same type of mini-usb port/jack, and I'm looking for a short usb cord with an accessible plug.  I'll plug it in and tape it down for keeps, then  I can use the other end of the cord for charging, instead of in and out of the tablet every day."}

Also, the touch ID would not work 3 times out of 4, often leading to a 30 second block, before allowing to try again or input numerical pin. I was probably just unlucky with this particular machine, but while using it i noticed other design flaws that have left me generally unconvinced with this model. Speakers are located at the bottom, next to the control buttons, so most of the times you end up obstructing the speakers with your fingers. Additionally, the speakers themselves were super low. This means you tend to use them at full volume, thus distorting the quality of the sound. On a positive note, the aesthetic and feel of it was nice and sleek and the small weight made it very portable."}

I bought a Roku Streaming Stick to cast / stream my Tab S2 screen (apps, music, videos, etc.) to my Vizio Smart HDTV.

And, has much more storage, expecially with the optional micro memory card.\n\nI was a bit unhappy with the volume from the speakers, but that was resolved by downloading and installing the OS updates, and the Volume + app.\n\nAnd there's more... it comes with Microsoft Office - so, you can create and edit your Office docs right on your Tab S2... if... it's really necessary (easier with larger screen / keyboard of your notebook PC).\n\nThe rest is in all of the comparative reviews available online - which echo much of what I've noted here.\n\nWhile Apple has some great products... the competition has pretty much caught up and surpassed them in some respects.\n\nSo... there you have it - you won't be disappointed."}

It stands for organic.\n\nI went Into a bestbuy store today and started to do a web search with the tablet.  I went to CNN.com.  Just wanted to see how it performed.  I was surprised when I saw screen burn like we used to experience on crt monitors and in some cases on plasma tv's. It was probably more evident as CNN has a lot of white space on their pages.\n\nThis may not bother you but if your interested do a search on Amoled and be informed.\n\nAt the very least Samsung should be replacing these long standing display models so users like myself never get to see the rest of the story.\n\nI was totally shocked. The Samsung sales rep says that happens that this display model has been running day and night for months or longer so sooner or later the screen will start showing artifacts as the organic compounds break down."}

I will try to keep the review according to the generic view of the Galaxy S2 platform.\n\nThe bloat ware is horrible.  That is no slight on the tablet, just laying it out there.  I hate the fact that this potentially powerful device is load with superficial crap right out of the box.  The Andriod OS Marshmallow is genuine and has plenty of features.  I did find that the internal volume from the tablet seemed excessively low.  I frequently had to keep the volume loaded.  I usually keep my other tablets on mid-range in the volume department.  I found no issue with the volume if I used my wired headphones.\n\nI do not use any accessories for the device, but the camera functions well.  I use the tablet mainly to surf internet and connect to items in my house.  This is basic tablet usage.  I decided not to replace my existing iPad or iPad mini, since I am very concerned about the amount of software overhead on this tablet.  At a glance it appears that over 1/3 of the available memory is consumed by the bloat ware.\n\nThe screen on the 8\" tablet is gorgeous and clear.  I have no trouble watching news clips or media.  It is easy to clean the device as well.  There are a few spots that accumulate grime.  Easy to get it off.  I have no purchased a screen protector or a cover for the device, but so far no damage.\n\nI have not experimented with the device to fully use all of the incredible features, but it seems well built."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01DXVKQEW", "review": "I have been an iPhone and iPad user since the first iPhone and full-size iPad came out.  Over the years, however, I have come to enjoy Android side of the world more.  I have one primary reason for liking Android better, and that is the ability for my photo backup apps (or any app) to run in the background without having to open the app.  iOS limits background activity from occurring non-stop, even though some iOS apps have found a way around this limitation by basing the background activity on your GPS location changing.  With Android, apps can upload all the time.\n\nA couple of years ago, I switched my primary cellphone to Android, so I am quite familiar with Android. I always had an iPad as my primary tablet, because I never felt like the Android tablet offerings were good enough to match my iPad.\n\nSo, about this tablet:\n\nKeep in mind I am a long-time iPad user.\n\nOver the past month, this has been my go-to tablet.  I let my iPad Air sit on the shelf for the entire month.\n\nThis tablet does everything my iPad Air does. With the exception of my movies that were purchased in iTunes, I have been quite at home on this tablet.\n\nIt is sleek, lightweight, and looks great too.  It is very, very slippery though.  I have almost dropped it a few times.  The front is all glass, framed by metal sides.  The back is a plasticy feeling material, and is the cause of the slippery-ness.\n\nThe headphone jack is on the bottom, which is a minor annoyance.  For a tablet designed to usually be held in the portrait position, having the headphone jack on the bottom is an issue when you are lounging on the sofa, with the tablet resting on your chest.\n\nAnother minor annoyance, is that the volume of the internal speaker doesnt get very loud, even turned all the way up.\n\nAccording to my Geekbench testing, this tablet scored a single-core score of 1454 and a multi-core score of 4879.  For comparison, my 2014 iPad Air scored a single-core score of 1478 and a multi-core score of 2683.  Again, my iPad Air came out in 2014, while this tablet is the newest revision  (as of this writing in July 2016) of the Samsung Galaxy Tab S2.\n\nSo, heres the deal.  I am really picking at little things like the speaker volume and placement of the headphone jack.  This tablet is excellent and very iPad-like in terms of quality, performance, and build.  As someone who has been sitting on the fence about going all-Android and leaving my iOS devices behind, this tablet has pretty much sealed the deal.\n\nNote: The above review is for the white 8 inch Galaxy Tab S2, which I received for review instead of the 9.7 inch Galaxy Tab S2."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01DXVKQEW", "review": "Bought to replace an aging iPad Mini (1st Gen). The switch from Apple to Android was mostly painless (assuming you don't have most of your media with Apple). The screen is much sharper, the performance - though perhaps not in excess of the current Mini - is leaps and bounds ahead of the old Mini it replaced. Really enjoy the expandable memory, the larger base memory, the great price, and drag-and-drop file management without iTunes.\n\nIf you're in the market for a smaller tablet for media consumption and basic Internet/productivity tasks, I think this is an excellent choice. TouchWiz still is not my favorite in contrast with stock Android, and I'd love to see less factory-installed bloat, but this is a great machine nonetheless.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B01DXVKQEW", "review": "Great screen.  Very fast...but...Videos and Netflix just look odd watching on this tablet.  The speakers are located where one would naturally hold the device so you are constantly moving your hands to not muffle the sound.  I loaded music on the SD card and about every other song is messed up.  The song will play for about two seconds then go to a high pitched noise.  Plus the album art is all messed up.  Somehow the tablet thinks about 1,000 of my songs came off of the Fast Times at Ridgemont High soundtrack?  HUH?  Now I want to remove the SD card as I wanted to attempt to put the music on the SD card first then put it in the tablet to see if that solves the problem.  Of course, as I suspected the first time I used the key, I've lost the key.  Whose stupid idea was it to have a key for the SD card?

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B01DXVKQEW", "review": "We have a few tablets bouncing around our home at the moment.  These devices are primarily used to stream TV shows, check Facebook, and play games.  I personally use my phone, a Droid Turbo with 5.1 Android OS, for most of my activities.  These activities include those mentioned above, but I also use it for recording interviews, shooting video, and taking photographs.  I've never really used a tablet (I have a laptop) other than to help my kids out.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 might just change my mind about that, though, as I have fallen in love with this device.  It runs on the 6.0 Marshmallow Android OS, has a slim design, and includes both password and fingerprint protection (although you don't have to use the fingerprint if you don't want to).  The high resolution screen (up to 2048 x 1536 pixels) pops with color and makes webpages and social media sites look a lot nicer than they really are.  There are also some excellent tools available with this tablet like PowerPoint and Excel.\n\nPhoto quality is good, but I have seen better and actually prefer my Droid Turbo for photos than I do this tablet.  It does play video quite well, though, and I often use it to watch shows instead of watching on my small phone screen if I'm not at home to use my television.  The only other drawback is the speaker location, due to the fact that I often cover the speaker with my hands while using the tablet.  Other than these minor (and I mean really minor, hence four stars and not three), this tablet is great.\n\nI find myself using it at higher frequencies with each passing day, and I'm more and more impressed by it with each use.\n\nAs a hardcore laptop guy, I have to admit that I really like this device.  It's convenient, easy to use for all \"tech\" levels, and includes many more excellent tools than I can really list.  I recommend it."}

The overall size is nice as well, 8.0 inches, big enough to get a clear view of books or movies I like to read/watch on my tablet, but still small enough that I can fit it in my back pocket.

It's a different OS and setup than a comparison to Apple iPad Air 2, but it will allow you to consume media and multi-task with no issues.  I couldn't internet browse after 9.3 iOS update on my iPad 2, but with this Tab S2, it's a breeze. You have a battery optimizer built-in also that can allow you to fully utilize your available RAM. There are many nice additional features that this device has that you won't get w/ Apple such as swipe to capture screen image, face awareness screen awake, and the use of back and multiple tile buttons near the home key.  Marshmallow 6.0 runs flawlessly on this and I've had no issues since I've been using it.  Charge it properly your first time (charge full before use, drain, then charge fully again), turn off the lighted keys near the home button through a 3rd party app, and your battery will last you a good 7-8 hours.  At $400 now too, this is a better product to buy than the $600 iPad Air 2 or $700+ iPad Pro. You can pop a 128gb microSD in this or attach an external hard drive to this via adapter and add more memory than you could ever get w/ Apple. Plus, Android is a refreshing change to Apple iOS.

The SM-713 does not disappoint in any way."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B01DXVKQEW", "review": "***My review is the for 8 inch model***.  I requested the 9.7 inch as part of the Amazon Vine review program, but was sent the wrong one.  I already have a 9.7 inch iPad so I actually like the 8 inch for travel etc.  The Galaxy Tab S2 is my first Android device.  I have been using this tablet for web browsing, youtube, and basic email.  For those functions the Galaxy tab has worked well.  Setting up the device was easy and I was up an running in just a few minutes.\n\nThings I like\n\n1. Size- I actually like the 8 inch size for travel and easy of carrying around.  If I didn't already have a 9.7 inch tablet, I would prefer the larger size, but since I already do have one this size is nice.\n\n2. Ease of setup- the Android setup was easy and only took a minute or two and I was ready to go.\n\n3. Google Store- so far the Google app store is easy to use and my regular apps that I have used on my iPad are there.\n\n4. Camera- the camera on the Galaxy seems very good for the price point.  The zoom is clear and easy to use.\n\n5. Expandable storage- mine is a 32gb model so not sure if I will need more but it is a nice feature to be able to add a storage card.\n\n6.  Price- good price for a nice tablet.\n\nThings I don't care for\n\n1.  Edges- the edges of the table are not rounded and I find it not as comfortable as other tablets I have used.  The 8 inch model may contribute to this as there is no sizable border, requiring me to put my thumb on the size of the tablet.  Not the most comfortable when using for longer period.\n\n2. Screen- while the screen is very sharp and clear, I have noticed how white background turns a blue color when not viewed straight on.  Don't get me wrong, the screen is very nice but when holding the tablet at an angle, white background color fades to a blue color.\n\n3.  Multitask and back buttons- Samsung has next to the \"home\" button, a button for seeing multiple apps (to close) and a back button.  While very easy to use, Samsung decided to make the buttons light up and the lights turn on and off a lot.  I haven't found a way to disable that feature, so it can be distracting.\n\n4. Touch screen- maybe its just the Android version, or its the screen, but sometimes when closing out apps through the multitask it takes several times for the app to close when touching the \"X\" close button.\n\n5. Speakers- they are a bit weak but for everyday use they get the job done.\n\nOverall, I like the Galaxy Tab S2 and it is a worthy tablet for the price.  There are just some things that could be more refined to make it a great experience.  But, for the price it is expected that you are not going to get perfection."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B01DXVKQEW", "review": "EDIT:  After watching more videos in different lighting, I have noticed a persistent issue with the screen in dark settings.  For example, the dramatically lit scenes in The Walking Dead or Game of Thrones.  Rather than a consistent luminance across the screen, there are bands of brighter spots and darker spots.  The light bands seem to show where the screen is edge lit.  It's not terrible, but it makes certain types of shows difficult to see, since the already low contrast is exaggerated.  I have modified the score accordingly.\n\nHow do you choose the best tablet or phone, when there are so many similar models from different brands?  I struggle with that every time I choose a new one.  But, having used all sorts at this point, I have come to like this tablet more than most, and it is nearly perfect for reading or watching videos.\n\nBUILD\n\nThere is nothing interesting about the S2 design.  The front features the generic Samsung button and the back is a bland matte surface.  They are tacitly admitting that people are going to put a case on it anyway, so why bother?  Still, it feels solid and pleasantly lightweight, making it better for reading than I expected.  The screen can't beat an e-reader, but sometimes I need color and size.\n\nThe only ports are SD, which is under a flap, and micro SD.  I am disappointed that this 2016 tablet doesn't have a USB C port, but that probably isn't a deal breaker for most.  Having an SD card more than makes up for it.\n\nDISPLAY\n\nOne of the biggest differentiators between low and high end tablets is display quality.  The S2 doesn't disappoint in that area, with a 2048x1536 AMOLED panel that gives sharp text and detailed imagery.  That aspect ratio is more suited to PDFs and magazines than movies, so expect black bars with video.  The contrast is good for this price range, but certainly not the best I've seen.  Likewise, there is a bit of motion smearing that I wouldn't accept in a high cost tablet.\n\nCPU\n\nThe speed of this tablet was surprising to me.  My main experience with Android has been low end devices, while my experience with iOS has been the newer devices.  This tablet was faster and smoother than both.  It's great to use a tablet that I don't have to worry about weighing down.\n\nBATTERY\n\nThe battery life has been excellent so far, even with demanding tasks that tend to kill battery life.  As long as I charge it once a day, I usually have the bulk of the battery remaining.  It also charges quickly.  I will update the review if the battery doesn't hold up well over the next couple years.\n\nFINGERPRINT READER\n\nEarly fingerprint readers on phones were such a nuisance to use that they never gained much traction, but they seem to be popping up in a lot of devices now.  As with the new iOS devices, the reader is fast and almost always reliable.  While it makes unlocking the tablet easier than using a password, also keep in mind that fingerprints don't share the same legal protections as passwords and are relatively easy to \"hack.\"  Still, it's a nice feature when done right, and it is done right on the S2.\n\nCAMERA\n\nCameras on every tablet I've used have been mediocre, and the S2 front and rear cameras were no exception.  I have included a macro and distance shot with this review.  In short, they work for video chat or a quick snap, but lack the clarity or contrast you would expect in a good phone camera.\n\nSPEAKERS\n\nSpeaker quality on the better tablets tends to be the worst for some reason.  I guess placing them where they face the listener is seen as diminishing the style and it is just assumed that you will be using headphones or external speakers.  I recommend doing that, because the speakers are not loud, front facing, or good quality.  They do the job in a quiet area, but just barely.\n\nSOFTWARE\n\nIs Samsung software a detriment to the pure Android experience?  Probably, but it is not a big problem.  If you download the Google Now launcher, you can pretend that you are using stock Android and rarely will your fantasy be broken.  But, the included Samsung software such as the camera app is just not as polished or modern as the frequently-updated Google apps.  While Samsung apps can't be deleted, they can be ignored and replaced with others.  A mild annoyance for me was trying to figure out Miracast video streaming, since Samsung renamed it and moved it out of the display settings.  But, I eventually got it working.  Expect to run into minor frustrations like that if you are used to stock Android.\n\nA benefit of the S2 is that it is so popular that you can also find tutorials on loading more stripped down Android versions if you prefer.  If you just want the tablet to play movies, read books, and run apps, then you don't need to change anything.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThe Galaxy Tab S2's display, performance, and battery life make it a premium tablet at a good price.  If you don't mind working around some Samsung quirks and the soulless industrial design, I recommend it."}

I use it for many functions that I used to use my smartphone for; so now, hopefully, my phone will last longer (which will be a considerable savings in itself).\nI had been looking at this tablet for a while, but just couldn't bring myself to spend $399 on it.  So when I saw it at a reduced price of $299, I grabbed it up.  No regrets at all!\nI enjoy using it for Facebook, Amazon shopping, games, photos, etc because the screen is so much bigger than the screen on my phone..\nAlso, it is super fast turning on and seems to hold its battery charge fairly well.  It comes with a quick-charging cable, so that even if it does get low, it recharges really fast.\nThe screen is so pretty and bright; I just love looking at photos on it.\nI cannot comment on the camera as I have not used it since my smartphone has a really good camera.\nIf you are looking for a tablet, I would highly recommend taking a look at this one."}

As the tablet setup is the same as my phone, I was able to use this tablet immediately and with ease. However, I will always keep my 2nd Gen Kindle as I don't need Wi-Fi to download books while on vacation.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B01DXVKQEW", "review": "I helped my aunt select the older 810 variant as a replacement for her dropped tablet less then a month ago.  As a result I also helped set it up, for all apps, accounts, etc,. and got to know it fairly well.\n\nWhen Samsung released the 813 version, and had it available for a sale price, it was an impulse buy I could not resist.\n\nI have not used the two side by side, but based on memory the 813 feels a little snappier, and somehow the screen seems somewhat more matte vs what I remember from the very glossy 810.\n\nThis tablet is phenomenal for browsing, reading, video, and and generally any task that I have thrown at it so far.  It is the first of my 5 tablets, on which I can use \"desktop mode\" and really do not have any kind of low performance that I normally end up experiencing on other tablets.  (Tip, install Firefox, and add the Adblock plus plugin.)\n\nI also ran 3DMark, and other benchmark tests.  Overall this tablet is excellent, and even does OK, in gaming, though not great, due to high resolution.  Do not order this tablet to play games, get the Nvidia Shield K1 instead.  It was able to provide a far smoother experience specifically with games, and did nearly 3 times better in benchmarks.\n\nSo why the 3 star off rating?  Three reasons;\n-Wifi adapter could be better.  My shield tablet, Note 5 and laptops are able to send and receive data at a higher rate.  This tablet tops out at about 50mbps.  My speed fluctuates somewhat, but is usually 70-90mbps down, 35 up.\n\n-Speakers.  Why is Samsung always behind on speakers?  Due to being tiny, and on the bottom edge of the tablet, the results are disappointing.\n\n-Inability to remove \"Guest\" mode from lock screen.  It's actually a great feature to have available, to be able to say, turn on, hand the tablet to a friend, and they can use it without peeking at your private stuff.  The problem is the option is ALWAYS on from the lock screen, and even if a pin is added to the \"Guest\" account, the guest account can still be deleted from the lock screen!  This means that even without ANY technical knowledge, or ability, just about anyone can pickup the tablet, anytime, and make use of it immediately.\n\nMy main gripe is with the speakers, and the software.  The wifi adapter is definitely enough for just about any kind of use, so that is more of technical nitpick on my part, that my older cheaper hardware does better.\n\nOverall though, this is the BEST tablet to get as of June 2016.  Out of the box it is completely trouble free, exquisitely made, and easily the equal of the much higher priced ipads."}

For the past 3 years I've been using a Kindle Fire 7\" tablet, which I thought was cute at the time, but this is so much better I should have gotten one a long time ago.  I spent a whole lot of time and research on one particular issue so I thought I would take the time to share this information in case it might help someone else.  One of my requirements for a tablet was to be able to connect to my TV in some way to play the contents of the tablet onto the TV...you can't seem to find a tablet these days with an HDMI port (my Kindle Fire had one, but when I connected it to my TV the video would just freeze and I had to re-boot the tablet to recover).  Anyway, I thought I could use the USB/HDMI adapter made by Samsung (MHL adapter), but wasn't sure if it would work on this Galaxy S2.  I called Samsung and they told me it would work....they make 2 different ones, they told me to get the 2.0 version and it would work.  WRONG.  After a whole lot of time and research, I finally found some information that confirms this tablet does NOT support MHL, so you can't connect to your TV using that method.  I also have a Galaxy S5 phone which the adapter does work on beautifully, and a Galaxy S7 phone which it does not work on.  So I returned the adapter.  This S2 Tab has 2 alternative methods which you can use to connect it to your TV, however you must either have a \"smart\" TV or do what I did, and purchase the Fire TV stick, and then connect through that.  Select the \"mirroring\" option on your Fire TV stick, then on the Galaxy Tab turn on the \"Smart View\" option.  You can find that on one of the settings buttons on the pull-down buttons on the top of the screen where the Wifi, Bluetooth, and Auto Rotate options are located.  Once you make the connection you can view anything that is on your Galaxy Tab on your TV.  There is a second option to accomplish this called \"Quick Connect\", however that is limited as to which particular content you can share from your Tablet to your TV.  For example of you want to play a video from the Internet and then see it on the TV screen, the Quick Connect feature will not allow you to do that, so you have to use the Smart View option instead.  I hope this information is helpful to prevent someone else from going thru all of the effort I went thru to determine if I could use the MHL adapter with this device or not, which is extremely difficult to determine until you actually try it yourself.  If you research it, you will find conflicting information, where in some places it says that MHL will work on this Tab, and other places where they say it will NOT work on this Tab.  As I mentioned, Samsung customer support (on the phone), gave me the wrong answer to this question."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01DXVKQEW", "review": "All my previous tablets were eReaders, the latest being the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 Nook (10.1 screen), so this machine was a bit of a departure for me. Most of my comments will be in regards to how my experience with the Tab S2 compares to the Tab 4.\n\nTo start with the Tab S2 is noticeably lighter than the Tab 4. The S2 is 13.83 ounces to the Tab 4s 17.38 ounces. (Dont believe the number above. The S2 is NOT .3 ounces.)\n\nThe Tab S2 feels more responsive than the Tab 4, which it should since the S2 has twice the processors running at a faster speed. I don't feel like Im waiting for anything aside from whatever lag comes from my current internet connection.\n\nThe Tab S2 is smaller in both directions, but loses little in the way of screen real estate. The S2s screen is wider but shorter than the Tab 4, but I don't notice a real difference in display area, primarily because the S2 has twice the resolution of my previous machine2048 x 1546 versus 1280 x 800. Of any feature, the screen is where the Galaxy Tab S2 really shines. It is amazingly crisp and clear. It takes the work out of readingeven when my eyes are tired. Cant say enough about the AMOLED display. Wow.\n\nThe OS in the S2 is Android Lollipop and it was a bit of an adjustment from the KitKat Im used to. Nothing insurmountable. I was able to be productive right away, but there are some subtle differences. So far, I like Lollipop better. It seems a little easier to find what Im looking for.\n\nBattery life appears to be about the same with both machines, with the S2 maybe being a little better.  (Doubtless because it is a brand new battery.)\n\nOne of the nicest features of the S2 is in the setup. After answering a few initial questions, it located my Tab 4 (which I happened to have in the same room) and asked me if I wanted to upgrade / port from that. When I answered yes it proceeded to find all the apps I had on my prior machine and started downloading them. It also gave me the option to bring over all my files, as well. Very handy feature and will save most users a lot of time.\n\nOverall, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 is a great machine, and a worthy upgrade if youve had your previous tablet for a year or so. The price tag feels a little pricey to me, but Im sure it compares favorably with other tablets with similar specs. The screen, speed and expandability are top notch, and worth paying a little extra for."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01DXVKQEW", "review": "OS UPDATE (7 May 2017)  TAB S2 UPDATING TO ANDROID 7.0 Nougat\n\nThis review is for those contemplating upgrading from the old T710 or T810 to the new T713 or T813 versions.\n\nI am comparing the old Tab S2 (SM-T810) to the new Tab S2 (SM-T813). I have both the old an new versions with me, both with 64GB of internal storage, and I am comparing them side by side.  This comparison is also applicable for the T710 and T713 versions, and for the 32GB versions,\n\nPHYSICAL DIFFERENCES\nExternal appearance -- no difference between the old T810 and the new T-813 in physical dimensions, weight, appearance, or function.\n\nInternal processor - old T810 runs on Exynos chip set, while the new T813 runs on Snapdragon chip set.\n\nOS - old T810 runs on Android 5.1.1 Lollipop, while the new T813 runs on Android 6.01.\n\nEverything else on the spec sheets looks to be identical.\n\nPERFORMANCE\nThe old T810 puts out an Antutu score of 65,273, while the new T813 puts out an Antutu scor of 81,232\nThat is one huge gain in performance of the new over the old -- a 25% increase.\n\nIs that performance gain worth trading in the old for the new? -- maybe, depending on the price differential -- I figure its worth a minimum of $100 price differential. If you can get the new version for that or less, then you have a bargain you should probably jump on -- assuming you have someone worthy of passing the old machine on to (my wife in my case), or you can sell it for close to what you paid for it, less reasonable usage and any wear and tear you inflicted on it.\n\nIn my opinion, the performance increase is the real, and only legitimate reason to upgrade. And that is really only important for those who engage in 3D gaming.  If you just play board games, there is really little reason to upgrade.  Office apps are generally no going to noticeably run faster -- because they already run faster than you can discern.\n\nUSER INTERFACE\nThere is some visual differences from the native schemes between Lollipop and Marshmallow, which show up in Samsung's TouchWiz Interface. However, I run Nova Launcher on both machines, so for me there is very little visual difference between Lollipop and Marshmallow..\n\nSETTINGS\nThe settings are almost all the same in old or new version.  However, the location of the settings has been slightly revised  but not so much as you won't be able to find them close by.\n\nUSER MANUAL\nThe T-813 has a different User Manual than the T810.  I put the two manuals side by side and did a page by page comparison.  For the most part they both have the same information, just rearranged slightly different.\n\nNATIVE APPS\nMusic Player.  The new T813 does not have a native music player.  Not to worry, just go to the Galaxy App store and down load one, or go to the Play Store and download your favorite music player.\n\nCompass.  Neither the old or new Tab S2s have a compass app, but they both have a magnometer.  So download your favorite compass app.\n\nScreensaver / Daydream.  The T810 called it Daydream, the T813 calls it Screensaver  exact same function under SETTINGS >> DISPLAY\n\nFingerprint sensor.  The fingerprint sensor is much improved  more sensitive and faster on the new T813, over the T810.\n\nVIDEO\nTo test the video question of whether the new T813 played video slower or faster than the old T810, I ran several 4k videos simultaneously, side by side.  The 4k videos were taken by my cell phone, and the files were approximately 10Mbytes for a 1 minute video  so quite a lot of front-end processing would be required.  In just about every case the new T813 would start up faster, for about a 2-seond lead.  But once started, they both ran at the same frame rate per second.  So, it appears to me, according to my tests, the new T813 starts video faster in the real world.\n\nBATTERY\nTo test whether the battery on the T813 drained faster than on the T810, I set the screen brightness to 100% on both machines, set the screen timeout to max (10 minutes), loaded the same video in both machines, and then charged both batteries to 100%.  Every 10 minutes I noted the Battery level.  At first I had both sound levels at 100%, but I noticed the T810 at full volume was louder than the T813, so to keep that factor from muddying the results, I turned both sound volumes to zero.  So the results after hours of continuous video playing is:\n\n- - - - - - - - - AFTER 1 HOUR - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - AFTER 5 HOURS\nT810 -- 86% charge remaining (14% depletion) - - - - - - - 16% charge remaining (84% depletion)\nT813 -- 89% charge remaining (11% depletion) - - - - - - - 32% charge remaining (68% depletion)\n\nSo, it does look like the T813 has significantly better battery management than the T810  at least for this test.\n\nSo far, that is all I have found. And for me, it was worth the upgrade based on bragging rights and personal preference (but not necessarily based on logic).\n\nIf I find more differences that are noteworthy, I will add it to this review.\nI would recommend this upgrade to a friend!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01DXVKQEW", "review": "I just upgraded from a refurbished 2011 model of the nexus 7 android tablet, it was cheap and mid range quality but I usually like using my phone over it because it's faster and sharper.\n\nI read alot of ebooks, I like a pretty screen and I own lots of gear products so I bought the t713 s tab 2 which has been slightly upgraded (different processor and other things that probably aren't that important)\n\nI love it, I use my phone less, I read more books, I get things done faster than my phone on a Sexy screen.  as far as accessories I ended up getting one of those flexiglass like screen protectors, HD intelligent I think was the name, it did not noticeable reduce the screen brightness and responsiveness at all which was awesome, I got a case with a magnetic BT keyboard which is convenient because I'm not great with thumb typing, after a decade of world of war craft and steam, you probably won't be able to see my fingers.  I love that it had an SD card slot which is key, added in a high speed SanDisk MBPS micro SD card(I store alot of stuff for music and hi res photos, a 64gb would do justice)  I don't think in this day in age I would ever spend hundreds of dollars on any tablet without at least 32GB of internal storage.  Regardless of micro SD expandability, not all applications can be moved to your external drive without rooting the phone maybe.  the programs that can't be moved are usually the awesome professional application like MS Word, where regardless you do want them stored internally for better speed when talking to the device.  you will have to eventually pick and choose applications when you have a small 16gb internal memory.\n\nI also decided to get a big external battery for commuting and such.  they're handy, cheap, and work for  your tablet, phone, wireless Bluetooth headphones and various other devices.\n\nthe physical form factor feels nice,  the battery life isn't amazing but it's not below average.  the speakers on all of these devices more or less suck, get a wireless BT speaker or headphones for music.\n\nI pretty much checked every device in the price range and this seemed the best value without sacrifice the quality and features anyone would need.\n\nthe picture was taken with the tablet covered in bright sunlight, but I can still see it fine."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01DXVKQEW", "review": "The SM-T713NZKEXAR is the 2016 updated version, with Marshmallow 6.0.1 and a Snapdragon 652 CPU (versus the original SM-T710NZKEXAR model with Lollipop 5.1 and an Exynos 5433 CPU).\n\nThe display is great, it's very responsive, and picks up wifi signals well.\n\nMy only gripe is the 4000 mAh battery capacity, but that is a trade-off for having such a thin, light tablet.  Personally, I would have preferred a thicker, heavier tablet with a larger capacity battery, but this is a minor annoyance since I rarely take it away from home, and when I do I usually take a power bank for my phone anyway."}

I'm not going to go over specs and such since you can read those in a hundred other places.  Though I will say that the \"new\" version is preloaded with Marshmallow and now uses a Qualcomm octacore processor in place of the Exynos that shipped with the first gen.  I decided to make a quick video of my Tab S2 8 and the accesories I use with it (keyboard, mouse, otg adapter, and usb hub).  It is my hope that it will simplify the transiton for those of you that are not familiar with Android or haven't used a tablet before.  I've replaced my laptop and desktop with the 9.7 and 8 inch Tab S2's.  So far I've had no issue doing the things I used to do with my computer like: ms office, printing (wired and wireless), browsing the web, transferring documents etc to and from the device, and much more.  I even mirror my Note 5 on the tablet using SideSync so I don't have to switch to my phone for calls and texts.  Please watch the video to see how you can make a legitimit laptop/desktop replacement.  If you have any questions feel free to ask and if you found the review to be useful please indicate so.\n\nUpdate:  I noticed a post about the specific accessories I used in the review so I decided to list them out and you'll also see photos of each.  I used a Samsung branded otg adapter, HP bluetooth mouse, JellyComb universal bluetooth keyboard, and a generic 4 port usb powered hub.  I have used other otg adapters in the past without issue, but I still recommend the Samsung adapter.  It has a better \"feel\" to it than the generics.\n\nUpdate:  I recently received the Marshmallow update for my first gen 9.7 and now that I've had both tablets running the same OS for a while, I've noticed some minor differences.  The new version running the Qualcomm seems to be just a bit more smooth than the Exynos.  It also seems to have slightly better battery life, but that's a definite maybe since I'm comparing the new 8\" it to the original 9.7.  Other than that the two are virtually identical in terms of performance.  I'll continue to update this review if I notice any more differences in the future.\n\nUpdate:  I recently added a Samsung monochrome laser jet to my set up (model SL-M2835DW/XAA).  If you're looking for a versatile printing solution you should check it out.  I was able to print via otg adapter straight out of the box and I had wireless and cloud printing set up in a matter of minutes.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01DXVKQEW", "review": "I just got this version with Marshmallow already installed. Tested few apps and so far only had a problem with the Sony Playmemories not working with my RX100M4 camera. I guess it's because Marshmallow is new and Sony doesn't list the Tab S2 as a \"compatible\" device (yet). I am also using the KoGi cover/keyboard and it fits perfectly . As a long time Ipad user , I found this tablet to be as good or better . Screen is fantastic, it's light, microsd card is a must, interface with a PC is a breeze. No regrets, so far."}

The link didn't work, so then  I used the url, and I had to give them an authorization code, which I copied from their email and it  tells me it's not a valid authorization code.  Samsung......never again.  I gave it 1 star, only because I had to."}
