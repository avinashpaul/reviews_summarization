It freezes up,does not power up sometimes,the charger does not work,the touch screen is either too sensitive or not sensitive enough no middle ground. In my opinion Amazon should not allow this to be sold. It will be a grandkids toy. The grand kids did not want it either and they are 6 and 4. Just sending it back for a refund. Do not purchase this thing!"}

So far that's all we've used it for, but no problems.  The battery charge doesn't last all that long (I'm not sure how long, but only a few hours it seems), but overall it's fine for what I bought it for.  It has once-in-a-while gone to a black screen (shut off) in the middle of something, but if you hit the power button it goes right back to where it was with seemingly no inteference, so it's not a big deal.\nI have no other \"tablet\" experience (I own a Kindle fire which I much prefer to this) but overall I'm satisfied with this for our purposes (educational apps for a 1st grader)."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00B89NXME", "review": "I got this as a gift and don't know if this is the EXACT tablet I got, it was definitely a Chromo 7\" 4gb tablet in white.\nIt's not a bad tablet for the price. It works great, pretty good processing speed, but the screen resolution is pretty poor. Then the screen got cracked somehow and it wouldn't work at all, not like a phone with a busted screen and you can keep using it if you don't mind glass shards. No, it was just cracked, then the screen wouldn't respond at all. I couldn't turn it on or off since it's got no actually buttons and no way to remove the battery and I had alarms set on in I that I couldn't shut off so I had to wrap it in a towel and shove it in the back of a drawer and dampen the sound of the alarm until it finally died days later.\nOh, but check this out. My house flooded, all of my electronics were on the floor charging and were immersed in 3 ft of water. My laptop eventually got working again but the screen was never the same after that, it had horrible bright spots all over it. But the tablet was just fine, no issues at all.\nSo despite the issues I had later with the cracked screen it was definitely a pretty hearty product. I'm pretty hard on electronics, I drop them a lot because I have MS. Normally I buy cases and screen protectors right away, but it took me a long time before I got around to getting a case for this since it was a gift, and I must've dropped it dozens of times onto tile floors and concrete outside and it didn't even get scratched up. Because of this and the price, I think this tablet would be perfect for older kids. Just make sure they don't crack the screen. ;)"}

It is significantly more sluggish in comparison to the two, but you get what you pay for. Also, I was disappointed that it did not come with multiple profiles/users. On the Fire, it has a kids profile already preset, whereas the Chromo had one profile only, so we downloaded a kids app, which acted like a separate profile. I bought the Chromo, because it was recommended specifically for children and that it's even used in schools, but I found the lack of having a separate profile feature very disappointing, because how is a parent suppose to have control over what the child is accessing online? I will not buy this tablet again, I would rather wait until the Fire goes on sale again, because it's worth it. My daughter agrees."}

I bought this tablet as a gift for my 4 year old who has been a LOT more patient than I have been. I charged the tablet overnight and it showed a \"full battery\" meter. After 30 minutes of use trying to get it set up, the battery was already COMPLETELY drained!!! We installed a single small app on the device and it took several minutes per screen for it to load. We thought it may be the app so we tried others. Every app we tried caused the tablet to either crash or time out because it took so long between loading screens and on the rare occasions that this tablet did decide to load after ten minutes of waiting (a normal tablet would load in 2 seconds!) the images on the screen were rather unclear and blurry. I'd have given this tablet 0 stars if possible I was so disappointed. DO NOT BUY!"}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00B89NXME", "review": "Disappointed!\n\nI bought this item to use with my treadmill because I bore easily. I only want it to do one thing. Just ONE thing: I want to be able to stream the internet and watch k-drama and youtube while I work out. I'm not interested in filling it with aps or anything like that. I just want to have something to occupy my already busy mind.\n\nI've had this tablet a while. On day one the first thing I discovered is that it's incompatible with just about everything out there that fits my needs. That wouldn't be as much of a problem if websites weren't configured to sense if you're using a \"phone\" and I could just use a browser like I do on my computer. Of course not, no.\n\nSecondly, I can stream ONE music vidoe through youtube. ONE. Then it craps out. Maybe it's because it's memory is so small (I mean SMALL) and it can't handle it. I'm not sure. But I have to stop walking to hit refresh more than a dozen times per video on my workout routine to try to get it to play.\n\nMy husband, who does tech for a living, tried to upgrade the device's os and see about somehow increasing its memory. That was a complete waste of time.\n\nSo I have this device that's good for about three clicks on something and then slows down because it has no memory that won't even play a ###### four minute video.\n\nI hate this thing. And I'll never trust anything from this company again. About all its good for is making a video of me destroying it with fireworks and uploading THAT to youtube for other people to watch."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00B89NXME", "review": "We bought two, one for each child, for Christmas.  Such a disappointment. I know these are cheap tablets and certainly didn't expect anything fancy but this is disgraceful.  The first tablet became frozen on the Android screen upon startup after less than a week of owning it. I tried every possible reset according to the instruction manual to no avail.  It never fully turned on again. The chargers lasted less than a week as well.  The 4GB of memory is actually less than 1GB after the software required to run the device is accounted for. This wasn't a surprise; I knew 4GB was minuscule and I purchased micro SD cards to expand the memory. The problem is my children use the tablets primarily for apps, and you can't transfer apps to the SD card.  It only transfers apps partially, and not even to the SD card.. In external storage there was always a good 14GB of unusable wasted available space that no files would transfer to. The processor is slow beyond belief and causes games to lag and crash often.  These tablets can't even load a web page and the cameras are horrible.  I could live with some of these issues for the price, but the tablets both stopped working in less than a month.  On a side note, I personally was gifted two different brand tablets,one from my boyfriend and one from my parents.  The kids now have mine to replace theirs.  I had two tablets.. Now I have none.  I would like to add that one of the tablets was a $50 RCA Voyager with 16GB internal storage from Wal Mart.  It is exponentially better than the chromo tablets in every way for literally a few dollars more.  If you are getting a cheap tablet, get the RCA Voyager.  These chromo tablets are literally disposable."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00B89NXME", "review": "this is a perfect example of.. \"you get what you pay for\". I was very disappointed with this product. I bought 2, 1 for me and 1 for my mother-in-law. and if I hadn't bought them over a month before opening them I would have returned them. If you want a good quality tablet that is going to last I would suggest looking for a little pricier one. This one one worked good for my 2 yr old to watch Netflix and YouTube on and I wasn't upset at all when he threw it and shattered the screen. My mother-in-law still has her's and likes it enough. I would give it to my 10 or 9 year olds as a started tablet. But for me, and all I do on the tablet/computer it was very unimpressive."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00B89NXME", "review": "Have four kids, purchased 4 of these, so my review is not based on one bad experience but on 30 days of seeing four of these in action. Two of them are useless after 30 days or so, 24 hours after the last chance return, of course. The problem: the on/off button is cheaply made and breaks therefore rendering the device useless.\n\nThese tablets are as crappy as they come. The screen resolution is surprisingly poor. The cover comes off spitting out internal organs even after the most modest drop on the table. It is a $49 tablet and at that price about $40 too expensive. If the price is low, there is a reason for it. I know this, but somehow fell for it this time. My mistake - don't make it yours."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00B89NXME", "review": "I bought this for my son because he wanted to play google play apps and they were unavailable on his Kindle. My kids are very rough on electronic devices, so I don't like to spend a lot of money on the devices for my younger children. I purchase higher end electronics for my preteen and teen, but have learned that my youngest children will break devices regardless of the price so I now go with cheaper purchases. I bought this tablet and gave it to my son 2 months ago, and it is still working & hasn't broken yet. For my household, that is a good sign and I feel that I've already gotten my money's worth from this purchase.\nSo here are the basics on the hardware of this product:\nMemory--  This tablet has next to no available memory, but the purchase and installation of a memory card helped with that.\nSize/Weight--  It is lightweight and has a standard screen size of 7\".\nOperating System--  It runs on an Android operating system and is easy to use if you're used to Android products.\nBattery--  The battery life isn't great, so it needs to be charged often if you are using it for battery draining apps like watching videos.\n  Keeping the brightness of the display lowered helps to extend the battery life.\nColor/Case--  The color is bright and a nice shade of blue and stands out so it is easy to locate. The bright blue helps to distinguish it from\n  the other electronics hanging around my house.\nOverall Value--  For the price, it is a decent value and works as well as an electronic should at this price point.\n\nDon't expect the experience of a tablet at a higher price because you are guaranteed to be disappointed, but if you're looking for a good value tablet with the functionality that should be expected for this low of a price, then this is a product for you."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00B89NXME", "review": "The customer service from this seller was great. It was well packaged, and arrived quickly. The problem was with the quality of the tablets. Within two days, the power buttons became loose, and the frame on the tablet started to come apart. It also lagged, which could be my internet connection, but when I went on a laptop or a desktop the connection was fine. I was surprised because these seem to be geared towards kids, who use a lot of memory and bandwidth with their games in general. For an everyday tablet for reading, it should be ok. I would not fault the seller for this, however, and returning them was not a hassle at all. So great customer service, but unfortunately the product was cheaply made."}

In the time it takes to load a webpage on my tablet, I could have already did it several times on my laptop (even something as simple as a google search.)\n*The battery life is terrible.

Forget playing any type of game that you have to tilt the screen for.\n\nPros:\n*If you have patience, it will function for what you need.... eventually.\n\nIf for whatever reason you do get it (not everyone can afford an ipad, certainly not I), you will need the following additional items:\n1. A pack of styluses- The constant lagging and angrily dragging your finger across the screen to unfreeze it will get old and your finger will start to hurt.\n2.

The last 2 I just bought however were terrible. The first one never turned on. The power button was stuck so I returned it and bought another. It lasted 2 days and stopped working. It was sent back as well.\n\nI can't tell you how they're customer is because I've never actually talked to them. I had previously called customer service and left a message but was never called back. I sent an e mail and never received a reply.\n\n*my previous review\nI bought 3 of these tablets, all for my little kids so they wouldn't play with and break my more expensive tablets and iPad. they work great most of the time.  The biggest problem I run into is them not turning on even when they're charged. But if I plug them in again and wait for a bit I can usually get them to work.\n\nI just bought 3 more for my mother in law to give to my nieces for their birthdays. We both decided the benefits outweigh the frustration, especially for the price."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00B89NXME", "review": "Bought this as a Christmas gift for the grandson (5 years old).  He's very adept with an iPad so I was looking for something to stream NetFlix content as well as play appropriate games.  The first unit purchased would not turn on - the power button appeared to be broken.  That was returned and replaced with no problems, thank you Amazon.  The second unit works but there are two major flaws that are causing me to return this item and go with the Samsung tablet.\n\nFlaws:\n1)  The first problem is the speed.  It takes what seems like forever (especially to a 5-year old) just to boot up.  It honestly takes at least 45 seconds from turning the unit on to get to the user home screen.  After that the unit is just slow on everything.  Constant buffering when streaming videos makes for a poor user experience\n2)  The sound.  Like most of the inexpensive 7\" tablet designs the speaker output is on the back of the unit.  While system sounds like alerts come through pretty well, the sound during movie or video playback is horrible.  If you lay the unit flat on the floor or on a couch, you cover up the speaker and the sound goes from bad to almost non-existent.  Sure, you can use headphones or ear-buds but there aren't too many young kids that you can get to wear them."}

Knowing this, I was okay with these factors.\nHowever, when I got this, the speed was so incredibly slow, that is was basically unusable. It took an average of 15-20 secs for the tablet to finish processing 1 action (open the browser, swipe the screen, ect).\n\nLooking at the other reviews, I'm not entirely sure if the other tablets are as slow as mine.\nPerhaps it's just mine that is defective. The one I have is unusable is will be returned.\nUnfortunately, there is a shipping fee, so I basically lose ~20% of the cost."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00B89NXME", "review": "Bought this for a 3-year old, so keep that in mind. It works well and does what it says it will.\n\n- With wifi off but playing a game, the battery lasts 4 hours on the dot. Wifi uses quite a lot of battery as well.\n- The storage is small. The model we got was mostly OS and system files, which is normal with electronics like this. I had to give up my SD card just to fit all of my son's games (Angry Birds and Panda Pop and stuff) on at the same time. The tablet also seems to lose some storage off the SD card if you format using the tablet.\n\nBuy it with those things in mind and you'll be satisfied. For the price point I got pretty much what I expected. Buy an external battery (not removable) if you don't think you can keep it plugged to the wall more often than not, unless 4 hours of actual use is enough for you. The screen is good quality but I would recommend a case or at least screen protector for kids, the screen is not \"solid\" so it can smudge and probably scratch if you try hard enough. My only concern for the future is if he leans on the screen enough to compress it and leave marks on the inside of the screen, so a case would be wise.\n\nYou could deduce most of that by reading the product details carefully, I don't have any out of the ordinary use for it. The price is right for those specs for sure, especially for kids that want to play on adult's phones to excess. The only actual complaint I have that the storage advertised more than what was actually available (which is normal), but the product page says 4GB and only about 1GB (maybe less) is actually available and that is a pretty steep difference. And there are some bloatware \"speed booster\" or \"antivirus\" apps that cannot be removed but can be disabled (not intrusive, just taking up space now), which explains where more of the missing storage went to. So a micro-SD is pretty much going to be required at one point or the other. If only the storage came a little \"emptier\" or even if was advertised as being 1GB I would have a glowing 5-Star review."}

But for the price, and if it's for a kid that will probably drop it and break it at some point, it was well worth it.  It would be nice if it didn't come pre-loaded with so many apps that a kid won't ever use since the memory is so small."}

I am not getting any help from amazon or the company on returni g this product. I bought it on this lightning deal and didn't have time to read all reviews. I don't know how they are saying this tablet is originally $179.00. I am not happy paying $41.

When adding both types of internal storage together, this device has less than 3GB of storage even though it is advertised as having 4GB.\n\nAs a side note, if this is being purchased for a child (or anyone who will use it mostly for games), you may want to look at other options.  As a quick test, we tried playing Temple Run and Jetpack Joyride (two games we know will be played by the kiddos) and found both to be very slow and choppy...not quite unplayable...but close.\n\nWe also found that trying to stream video from PBSKids.org used up enough of the tablet's resources that taps were not being effectively recognized by the device.  It took quite a while to get back to the home screen just to move on to the next usability test.\n\nWe will be exchanging this for a slightly better, slightly more expensive option."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00B89NXME", "review": "I'm beyond impressed with this tablet. It's slow to start up and load webpages. The Google (Android) ecosystem is easy to set-up. I like - it's a phone too! Simple add a SIM Card. At this price point who could ask for anything more. It viewed a few movies the picture clear while not retina, but whose complaining. The sound is good and strong. I would suggest the use a Bluetooth speaker for better sound quality. It feels good in the hand and light. The touchscreen is responsive I hadn't taken off the protective cover and it worked just fine. This is intended as a gift for my sister who only has used of one hand. I think she'll able to manage this device without too much fuss. Lastly, I think this is a Chromebook at a steal of price. I own several tablets - Kindles, iPad and more...this one......holds its own against them."}

I called amazon (who were fantastic to deal with) and they could not do a replacement as it arrived to us without damage. Amazon located a customer service phone number for us to contact as the only thing on their website is a email (which they don't respond to). I called first time they said call amazon and hung up. Second time was a different story that is filled with a tech support individual informing me its not his job to chat when I asked a question for next steps. The call ended with me asking for a supervisor who also argued with me and closed with don't ever call again we will not help you. So, for a cheap kids tablet it is a good fit however, it is not durable and even though it comes with a 1 year warranty the company won't honor the warranty because they won't listen or answer questions."}

I was finally able to get it connected, but couldn't get it to stay connected. It would disconnect then say my Wi-Fi was out of range when in fact I was sitting right next to my modem and router. I contacted customer support and they were very helpful. They sent a replacement tablet, which works better, but still not the greatest. Now with both tablets I am having issues staying connected. Even when they are connected, it's still difficult to do anything such as watch Netflix or YouTube.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00B89NXME", "review": "Bought this to replace my daughter's RCA tablet that my husband sat on and broke (only because the RCA was out of stock and this was also baby blue and only a few dollars more).  I thought it arrived with a small crack in the screen, but it buffed out ok.  The graphic quality on this is much better than her old RCA, which is a plus.  Other than that everything else about it is quite disappointing.  The camera quality is a step below poor, though it is nice that it has front and rear cameras, even if they suck. Don't buy this if you want to take pictures of anything of even minor importance. If you would like your photos to look like your camera has severe cataracts, this is for you.  This tablet is SLOW and ran out of memory unbelievably quickly- she hadn't had it for an hour before I realized I was going to have to buy an SD card for additional storage.  Since this is a basically a cheap tablet (probably intended for children like mine), I didn't expect much, but I'd like her to at least be able to download Google Drive to type homework assignments, and it doesn't have sufficient storage. It's finicky about screen rotation, and I can't find a pattern to it. Basically, if you need something to keep a small child busy and only want to put a game or two on it, it should be tolerable, but don't expect any actual productive use out of this thing."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00B89NXME", "review": "My advice is to stay away from purchasing this product. I hope that this review will help other parents so they will not waste their money. We purchased three of these tablets as Christmas presents for our younger daughters thinking they would be a simple tablet for them to play some games and watch Netflix. We also invested in the extra sturdy, thick, child-proof covers. We did not have unrealistic expectations for these tablets. We were very excited, as were the girls, and the tablets worked just as we hoped... at first. As of today, less than 9 months later, all three machines have malfunctioned and stopped working. The first tablet stopped working less than 3 months after purchasing it. The second tablet stopped working within 5 months. The final tablet stopped working in August, a mere 8 months after purchasing it. I can assure you that these machines were not treated poorly; dropped; exposed to sunlight, liquid spills, heat; or in any manner that would cause them to stop working due to our fault. They simply would not function any longer. One day, each of them simply stopped working. They would appear to be charging and the Chromo logo would appear, but the machine would never actually move to the home screen. We have even purchased a generic charger, which fits, just in case it was the charger, but the tablets will still not work. The chargers do, in fact, charge our other electronics such as speakers, which are compatible with the charger, so we know it is not the charger. I thoroughly regret making this purchase and wish I had spent more money on tablets that would have worked. Now, I am out a good sum of money and have nothing in return. I highly advise you to stay away from purchasing these tablets. I truly believe that the positive reviews (the same ones I read when deciding to make this purchase) are published shortly after receiving the product before the machines mysteriously quit functioning.  As I stated before, for the first couple of months all the machines worked wonderfully and just as we had hoped for, but who wants to spend this much money for a few months worth of use. Spend more money for a tablet that will still be around in a few years; otherwise you will pay a lower amount of money, and get a short-lived, useless product. I wish I had spent more money on different tablets. Remember that I am not basing this experience on 1 tablet, but 3 tablets. We also have other tablets in our home, including Windows Surface and iPads, and we have had them for multiple years with no issues, so we know how to use and treat tablets. I also understand that I am comparing apples to oranges, but wanted to reassure you that we are pretty tech savvy at our home. I hope this review helps you make a financially sound decision. Best of luck in your tablet hunting!"}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00B89NXME", "review": "I let my daughter save her chore money and pick a tablet, and she picked this one I think because she liked the color. The main flaw with this device is it uses a thin diameter charger that is poorly made, and broke within a week. No problem, just use the micro-usb to charge like every other Android tablet, right? That doesn't seem to work on this tablet so it sits idle waiting to find a charger that matches up. For this reason alone I recommend you skip this tablet. Other cons: takes longer to charge than to use up the battery, screen resolution is noticeably low, the processor is barely up to running Android 4.2, and the build quality? An 18 inch drop will pop the case apart, causing you to carefully reposition the buttons and snap it back together. The screen hasn't broken, and all the buttons speaker camera etc are positioned exactly as the Z-pad so a bumper or case is easy enough to find for this. It's cheap, but not just in the inexpensive sense of the word"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00B89NXME", "review": "I've seen a lot of mixed reviews about this tablet. People complaining that's it's cheap. Well if you ask me that's the exact reason I purchased it. I purchased this tablet for my 5 year old son as a temporary tablet to see how he treats it and takes care of it. To teach him how to take care of nice things instead of destroy them. I will be buying him the nabi 10\" dream tab after this. But this tablet is a tester. One he can play games, and also have learning games and apps as well as watch Netflix. He's only had it since yesterday, and obviously he's 5 so it's bound to get broken. I am already expecting. So me spending $50.00 and free shipping was not a problem for me.\nThe battery does drain fast I've already noticed. And the sound isn't as loud as what I would like. But for $50 what do you really expect????? I'll just buy some little ear buds for my son. He doesn't know the difference. The tablet is true to color. A bright neon blue. He loves it. This tablet will come in handy on long trips in the car or waits in a appointment. And for another tool in teaching him reading and math. If it breaks, no biggie, I'll just buy another one for this cost.\nI definitely recommend this tablet for a child, or light use to anyone. Shipped fast, well worth my $50. If you are using this for business,work, or heavy use. You shouldn't be writing a scrappy review. If you want something for.heavy usage.then buy a more expensive tablet. And quit complaining about a $50 tablet that isn't doing what you expected."}

When it did finally download, the game could barely play for whatever reason. The other tablet totally and completely refused to check for any updates... said last update was in 1969. Huh. Neat huh. I couldn't get it to load the gmail account to even GET to the play store to download a game. The 3rd tablet was the charm... connects just fine, downloaded just fine, updated just fine...

The quality of this tablet is cheap although i do like the color. The resolution is wierd, almost 3D like and hurts my eyes.  Also the tablet won't stay charged all day. I charge for a little over an hour take off the charger and use for 2 hours and needs to be charged again.

If it would actually charge up all the way the tablet would be great its self I let my child play learning games on it mostly but with the battery being as it is I have to leave it on the charger almost all the time or it just dies like that. I really wouldn't have someone else get this one if it wasn't for the battery like I said it would be really great but the battery is the most important part of it. I could have just gotten a bad one as it is but still I guess you really do get what you paid for."}

It is low-end, which you should know by the price. But this is ultimately a disposable product. If anything goes wrong, just toss it and save yourself the hours of attempting to track the company down. They have a website with nothing more than a few product pages. No manual. No support. No contact info. My unit is stuck at the lock screen waiting for a PIN that doesn't exist. Most tablets could simply be reset to factory defaults but this tablet, along with a few other generic tablets, does not have a reset procedure. There is no combination of buttons that will work and there is no reset button. I even took it apart and desoldered the battery. Nothing worked. It is a brick. If you like bricks, I would recommend going to your local hardware store, they are much cheaper there."}

Keeps a toddler entertained when you need an hour to fold that laundry and empty/fill the dishwasher. its nice because with an affordable price like this I'm not afraid if he breaks it. It is also fair to mention that he constantly drops it and to my surprise he hasnt' been able to break it...yet.\nI wouldn't recommend this for an adult or even teen. I had ordered one for our 10 year old and returned it. The speed is very slow and it is limited in that it is not capability for some of the more popular apps.\n\nEdited review August 2016:\nI was contacted by the company asking if I'd give their improved tablet a chance. I was blown away by their offer so I agreed. Unfortunately I don't have anything better to say. This is a tablet for a toddler as long as you have a protective case. Again, the more popular apps such as Instagram or Snapchat would not download. Also, the battery life is poor on this version. After 30 mins the battery life is gone. I don't know, I would say this is a very conscientious company who is interested in making a good product for us that is affordable. They are making good efforts and look forward to seeing future improvements."}

Since \"damage\" occurred within 90 day warranty period, squaratrade referred me to CHROMO manufacture's Warranty.  I went to the CHROMO webiste side, it seems like they deliberately do not want to be contact for warranty claims.  There is no information on warranty claims, no information on returns and no contact number information. The only input for contact is via a web interface where you input your contact information and reason for contact.  When you do this, you cannot submit the information.

First, i did not receive two chargers, it is ungodly slow (im talking have been waiting for my facebook page to load for the last 7 min). I tried using the preinstalled Netflix app and i always get the same \"Netflix is unavailable\" message. I downloaded a few other apps that have worked when they want to it seems. I realize it was fairly cheap and i am not expecting it to run as an Ipad or Kindle, i just want it to run in general. Not at all happy."}

I am extremely upset because I order from Amazon ALL THE TIME and I never have had a problem like this. When I pay $60 for something I expect to be able to track it so I know exactly where it is and exactly when I am going to be receiving it. I work all day and need to make arrangements to have someone home to get the package. This is extremely poor customer service and I would like a refund if I cannot get an accurate tracking number. Today is the 18th and I still have no idea where this is. I will NEVER buy from this seller again. BUYER BEWARE!!"}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00B89NXME", "review": "I bought my daughter an RCA tablet for Christmas. A month later I pick her up from her moms house and ask her why she does not have her tablet. She tells me that her knee locked up going upstairs, she dropped it and the screen cracked. I  know it was an accident and I feel bad so I want to replace it but I am on a budget. I ordered this as a cheap replacement. I gave it to her on a Friday at 5pm when I picked her up and she said it was great. She loved the layout because it was more like her cell phone than the RCA was. By 3pm the next day she came to me and said \"Dad I didn't drop it but its broken. Its not working right.\" I had already read about this and knew the solution. I told her to hold down the power button for 15 or 20 seconds to reboot it. An hour later I asked her how it was working. She said that it was working the same as when she took it out of the box. Its nice that it is easy to use but needing a reboot after less than 24 hours concerns me about the future of this tablets performance.\n\nUPDATE: My daughter is only here 2 weekends a month. After just 3 weekends the charging plug inside the unit no longer works. We had to plug my cell phone charger into the micro-usb slot instead. The screen is made of plastic instead of glass so wiping it with a paper towel and glass cleaner scratched the screen horribly. I will NEVER buy this brand again! They should have called it Crappo instead of Chromo!"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00B89NXME", "review": "I really like this tab. For the price, it's definitely a good deal...well that's what I thought until it just stopped working. I've had it less than 2 months and it was fine just 20 mins ago. Anyway, I liked the fact that I could download free office apps to create and edit documents and it even allowed me to connect the tab to the computer, open and edit docs then print. I guess it could also connect directly to a printer as well. I'm so disappointed that it broke down especially since I just ordered one for a friend. I don't play any games and it never fell so I'm really confused about why it stopped working. Netflix works well on it but surfing can be a bit slow which is a little weird I guess. I really hope it turns back on cause sending it back will be a bit expensive for me since I live in the Caribbean and ordered it through my skybox address.\nUpdate (approx 4hrs after the shutdown): the tablet has finally cooled down (it was very hot in the area where I assume the battery is) so I decided to plug it in and voila, it started charging and is now on. I'm not sure why it blanked out in the first place but I did try charging it before but that proved to be useless while the back was hot. I'm still a bit disappointed and fearful that I won't be lucky the next time it shuts off but I do like how it works given the price. This is my first tablet and I opted for a cheap one since I wasn't sure if I'd really like or need it. Now I know for sure I love having a tablet but next time I'd get something much better."}

I opened it up and installed some games, watched Netflix, and surfed the internet. It is surprisingly fast, charges fine, and battery seems to last. I use my car charger to charge it without any issues. It is great and keeps my little one happy as she can watch Netflix on the way to the sitters(I have mobile hotspot on my cell phone). This thing doesn't lag with movies or games. My little one has even dropped it once or twice and it still works fine.\n\nI like that it is supported by google play store as there is a lot of free kids games that are put out for android devices making it ideal for my little one.\n\nI know some people complain as theirs arrived broken or not able to charge but I ordered one on Black Friday(2013) and its still going strong.\n\nLet me add it has been like a Christmas present to me as well as I have my smartphone back now LOL.\n\nIf anyone has any questions about it feel free to message me.

The tablet is ok since it is a backup for my other tab. A little slow but it streams netflix ok and loads Google Play ok. I got a keyboard case to protect it and make typing easier. Not bad for an entry level tab but don't expect it run like an iPad or a Samsung."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00B89NXME", "review": "while my son is quite smart, he forgot to write down the password on his new, 3-day old tablet. We tried emailing the company, took it to 3 different locations of computer repair/ sellers/ wiz-kids and no one could take it back to factory reset, by any means. There's usually a small hole on an electronic device that allows for slip-ups like this,  It's apparent this company couldn't be bothered to do this, so now we have a great door stop that cost me hard earned money and my son's fee for this equipment is feeling bad, and having no reward for straight A's in school.\n\nI will not be purchasing another tablet from you guys, that's for sure. Amazon couldn't help either - the From-another-country-\"tech\"-support-person couldn't understand why the Chromo doesn't have a reset button either and ended the call. I'm not kidding. He said, I'm sorry I can't be of any help without a reset button and then hung up on me.\n\nWe're moving on from Chromo simply because there's no reset button. It sounds ridiculous, but it's true. Regretfully, Brooke Webb"}

Based on the return/exchange policy of AMAZON, I had to do so by May 9th, 1 month after. Isn't there a warranty for 1 year on products like these? I would suggest checking before ordering it.\nThis was bought for my 2 and a half year old from my mother. It is an ok tablet. It is slow and freezes alot. But for her, it is fine. I would not recommend it for someone who really wants to use it for much more than entertaining a child though."}

Well now I have the answer! A-MA-ZING! It's so cheap and delicate and the battery stays on for 4 hours, and doesn't take much to charge! I'm so happy that I bought this product, the internet browser is VERY fast and has good touch, it doesn't freeze and the apps don't stay for 5 minutes it's a really good tablet and I hope you buy it!! I was nervous thinking it'd be horrible but totally changed my life! Don't hesitate to buy it! It actually came 2 days then the delivery estimate! It gives you 2 chargers a manual and the Chromo Inc itself...gosh I love it! I KNOW you will too!"}
