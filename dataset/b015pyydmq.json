The SSD was a tight fit and BIOS picked it up right away. When you 1st start the laptop, Windows will finish installing. If you added a 2nd SSD you need to right click THIS PC then click MANAGE then click disk management. You will see 2nd drive unformatted most likely. Click and follow prompts to do simple format (I made 1 partition of whole drive). Then you're in business.\n\n  I loaded Diablo 3 , Guild Wars 2, and World of Warcraft from a thumb drive. They all played flawlessly at full resolution will high frame rates. Guild wars 2 was in mid 50s. Other 2 were even higher with Diablo 3 being maxed graphics with no problems. Didn't even warm up playing it and WoW .Look forward to trying Fallout 4 on it in a couple of weeks. That should be a better test of the GPU and heat issues.\n\n  The screen does have some light bleed in lower edge of screen , but only on startup when screen is black. That is the only time I noticed. Not sure about visual  quality vs other computers, but looks better than my desktop monitor at work, and my 4 year old laptop I'm replacing. If they cut corners here, I'm not really noticing that much since I'm not doing any photoshop or pro stuff where color has to be spot on.\n\nThe keyboard is responsive and similar to many other laptop keyboards. Love the full size keys. Not jammed too close together so fewer typos. Sound is decent for a laptop. The laptop is whisper quiet unless you are pushing the graphics card a bit, then the fans wind up a bit. Still not too loud. You can go to sound settings and tweak equalizer to get sound you prefer.\n\n  The nice thing about this computer is you can sneak it past your wife as a business computer, but it runs like a much more expensive gaming laptop. Nice to be able to play a game while on a business trip. Will probably add 8Gb of compatible ram a little later so it will run dual channel. Highly recommend 2nd SSD in this unit. Runs games so well, you will want to install a ton on here. Can get another 256gb for $89 any day of the week with 512gb running around $150-160 for name brand.\n  All in all, very pleased with my purchase.\n\nUpdate: After a weekend of gaming and surfing the web, I've found that you really need to download the latest drivers for the Intel HD video card, and the Wireless driver as well. Fixes many little irritating freezes and glitches. Just go to device manager and update from there. I also updated the Nvidia 960M driver though I never had a moments problem with it. Still loving this laptop!\n\n2nd Update: Got Fallout 4 last week and have played more hours of it than I care to admit. The laptop has handled it perfectly with very little heat buildup. No glitches, crashes and lag whatsoever. I play it on Medium settings and get 40-50 FPS . The game  works on high but FPS dips into the low 20s at times which will ruin your aim a bit. Only use VATS for bosses. Gonna try Witcher 3 next which I hear is even more of a graphics challenge."}

I always opted for 'budget' computers, and this one is really strong. I'm able to play Starcraft 2 and Diablo on high settings. Still haven't tried LoL or Borderlands but I'm sure they'll be just as great. The laptop does get quite warm, but I already ordered a cooler and a vent cooler so I'll be set. I do recommend getting an external mouse and keyboard."}

Because of the GTX 960M and that 256GB SSD.\n\nIt also comes with a HDD bay (empty) where you can install an SSD or 2.5'' (9.6mm thick) HDD.\n\nYou can add another RAM (it comes with 8GB and it's capped at 16GB, nbd.)\n\nThe machine is also pretty quiet; even when I was cranking it up running GTA V, it barely made any sound. The hybrid cooling system is impressive.\n\nThe battery life is pretty good. With just internet browsing and word document actively being used, you will get around 6 - 7 hours easily, depending on your brightness settings.\n\nThe laptop is never hot, which is awesome. The bottom is barely warm, so you can totally lay it on your laps.\n\nDownside: the trackpad is not the best one I have used and the speaker could be better."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "I have always had fairly high end desktop computers - always with Intel (where I once worked) and Nvidia (with which I worked) processors.  I continually upgrade motherboards, CPU's and graphics boards, something that can't be done with laptops.  Recently I have been looking for a laptop computer that I would find useful with a limited budget and, at $800, it is difficult to imagine a better bargain than this Dell Inspiron i7559-763.  I made a leap of faith and ordered this computer before it was even released - something I have never before done.  So far it has been fast and reliable, and I am definitely happy with my decision.  It even runs cool and quiet.  Other high points for me are:\n\n- Intel i5-6300HQ processor\n- Nvidia GTX 960M GPU\n- Bright, sharp IPS screen\n- Backlit keyboard\n- SSD\n\nWhen I received this laptop I discovered another feature that I definitely appreciate.  There is a large hatch on the bottom of the computer that can be opened with a single screw (and without breaking any seals).  This hatch provides easy access to the memory and AN EMPTY SLOT FOR A DISK DRIVE WITH A CONNECTOR CABLE WAITING!  The only hesitancy I had about the features of this computer was the limited storage space on the included SSD (i.e. 256GB) but that is now a non-issue with the easy addition of another SSD in the future.  I even temporarily installed a 2.5 inch HD I had lying around and verified it would work.  There also appears to be an empty slot for another memory card but I did not test it.\n\nOne feature I didn't test well is the touchpad.  All touchpads are beneath contempt to me so I always use a mouse.\n\nSo far this is a great computer and I definitely recommend it."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "Just received this laptop today, 10/27/2015.\n\n***Summary***\nOverall, I am very pleased with this laptop. I think it's a fantastic value for the parts you are getting. The overall look and feel of the laptop is great, the red trim is not overbearing. Using the laptop feels fast and snappy. Boots Windows 10 in less than 20 seconds! The weight and size keeps it portable, but it's no Ultrabook. The laptop doesn't have a touchscreen, if that's a deal-breaker for you.\n\nMore details are below, wanted to keep the summary at the top for the folks who don't care to read the whole review.\n\n***Short review***\nBuild quality seems good to me. The unit is all plastic on the outside; however, I am okay with this. It is a very soft plastic that is nice to the touch. The unit does not feel flimsy and seems fairly durable. It also appears (at first glance) that access to the HDD and RAM won't be terrible, as opposed to some other new laptops on the market, there seems to be a removable plate/panel on the bottom of the laptop to access the bottom of the mainboard, picture attached.\n\nBoot time is rather fast. From the time I hit the power button it takes about 17 seconds until I am at my Windows 10 desktop environment. This is exactly what I was looking for. You will not achieve this in laptops without an SSD hard drive.\n\nWireless internet signal is pretty strong. I am fully able to receive a signal in the very back room of my house (35+ feet w/ walls), on par with iPhone 6 Plus.\n\nThe main storage drive is an SSD, it is a SanDisk Z400s M.2 2280 256GB. Read/Write speeds are fairly strong, I have attached a picture from a CrystalDiskMark speed test I ran. The SSD drive from Dell has (4) partitions, you are left with approximately 200GB free of 225GB available when you receive it. The Dell backup image takes up about 12GB. The fact that your operating system is installed on the M.2 drive would mean that you can add an additional HDD or SSD in the spare 2.5\" SATA bay for additional storage. I am not familiar with the spare bay yet.\n\nMemory/RAM is pre-installed 8GB of DDR3, installed in 1 of 2 available slots, according to CPUZ. This leaves spare slot open for future expansion. The RAM is PC3-12800 (800mHz) (PC3 1600) Hyundai Electronics P/N - HMT41GS6BFR8A-PB, with a CAS Latency of 11, according to CPUZ.\n\nBattery life is unknown at this point, I haven't had enough time to fully test this. While playing around with the laptop for the last 3-4 hours I still have about 87% left.\n\nKeyboard is comfortable to use, even with large hands. The 10-key pad is a little undersized, but this keeps the primary keyboard area nice and roomy. The CapsLock key does have a light on the key to indicate whether or not CapsLock is on; although, NumLock does not. The backlit keyboard features (2) brighness levels and is a nice blueish white color light output. The backlit keyboard seems to provide adequate light.\n\nSound quality seems very good thus far. I watched a couple music videos online and the vocals were clear. The bass was lacking, but this is a laptop, this is to be expected.\n\nI really like that the charger has an indication light on the cord, on the end that plug into the laptop port, that lets you know the charger is powered. The charger also features a built in strap to keep the cord neatly stowed while not using.\n\nNot an overly amount of bloatware installed. Mainly Dell proprietary applications for updates and registration.\n\n***For those who care...why I decided on this laptop.***\nI had been shopping for a laptop for everyday use that could also handle heavier tasks such as multi-tasking with multiple browser windows open, music playing, light duty photo editing etc.. I did want a laptop that was portable, but I was not willing to trade off the \"more affordable\" power you get by not shopping for an Ultrabook. I was also not as concerned with a touchscreen (don't care for a smudgy screen).\n\nMy criteria was:\nSub $1000\n256GB or greater SSD, I wanted something that would boot Windows fast!\n8GB Ram Minimum\n15\" Screen Minimum\n1920x1080 Resolution Minimum\nDecent dedicated GPU.\nWindows 10"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "Great value!  This is a deceptively powerful laptop for both the pre-order and listed price.  While it certainly does not have a premium look or feel, the plastic case feels sturdy enough and the keyboard and trackpad get the job done.  The 15.6 matte ips screen looks great, although there is definite screen bleed.  It doesn't bother me so much, but you will definitely notice it as you boot up, or if you are watching/playing something with darker colors along the edge.  The laptop has red flair on the logo, along the trackpad, and along the speaker, but it otherwise looks presentable and not overly gaudy like some gaming centric laptops.  This thing also runs relatively quiet and cool, which is another huge plus.  This laptop is a perfect budget gaming laptop, with solid specs and acceptable trade-offs in terms of build quality.  It doesn't feel like its going to fall apart or overheat, and it does not draw attention to the fact that is for \"gamers\".  Perfect for my needs!"}

Overall it is not a high end machine based on the case material, it is a lot of plastic, but the components should give better performance than about 99% of other notebooks that are sold.

The specs will definitely blow you away if you're coming from an old laptop like I am.\nThe hardwares in this Dell Inspiron 15 7000 are fast, not high-end fast but mid range fast and for it's price at $800 I would say its a steal. As you can see it packs a FHD screen 1920x1080 that looks good however there are minor backlight bleed near the bottom of the screen for my particular model. The Intel core i5 6300hq is a quad core and handles gaming really well; coupled with the new gtx 960m with 4gb of dedicated graphics handled Heroes of the Storm on Ultra with no sweat @60-70 frames (70 degrees average gpu temp.). Have not yet tested the 960m's full potential but I'm sure it can handle most 2015 games on High. The ssd is a sandisk with around 205gb of actual available memory. The backlit keyboard looks better than I thought. The build feels solid and the matte black looks great on this new design. It looks thin from afar but its actually bigger than Donald Trump's ego."}

It runs off of an Intel HD Graphics 530 integrated card, which certainly runs games just fine but don't expect to be playing on the highest resolutions with smooth and high FPS on those settings. The laptop has suited me just fine for a while now, but the build leaves much to be desired after the corner of the laptop chipped away after a very minor bump and now it has problems opening and closing. All-in-all a decent laptop, but leaves much to be desired for the price range and being called a gaming laptop."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "I've owned this machine for about two years now. It's been a solid laptop and I have yet to experience any major issues.\nI've used this throughout my undergrad as a computer science major doing small time software development. It is a bit slow when it comes to running a VM and some larger complexity learning models and algorithms, and the 256 GB of space runs out pretty quickly. Also, it is extremely heavy to carry back and forth and all around a large college campus every day...I had to find an especially large backpack to carry it and I can't tell you how many people's eyes bulge when they try to pick up my bag for me.\nHowever, I will say the topcase is quite sturdy. I've got a very pointy trophy that sits above my desk and I've accidentally knocked it over two times. It landed on my keyboard (and thankfully not my head) and created quite some dents in the Y key and the touchpad, but everything still works perfectly. (I have subsequently moved the trophy for the health of the computer and my skull). The charging cord is only just now starting to show signs of breaking on the computer plugin side. I've reinforced it with toothpicks and electrical tape, which works just fine, although is maybe not the most professional look. So if you play hard with your machines like I do, this is probably a decent bet. The speed and reliability overall is good...I have had very few frustrated moments in the last two years dealing with it, which is probably the best track record of any laptop I've ever owned."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "We are having the same issue as countless others, the left hinge came apart after 10 mos of gentle use and the laptop started having charging (and power related performance related) issues.  Dell refused to fix it claiming the issue was not under warranty (just google \"dell hinge issue\" and you'll see how widespread the problem is, I will not be surprised to see an eventual class action).  Dell then unethically tried to get me to purchase a $200+ extended warranty even though they had a statement right on their website that no warranty covered the hinge repair at that time. They now have an updated statement on their website that they will cover the repair if it's still under warranty, but now the computer is out of warranty (we've been dealing with the issue for 8 mos) so we are still stuck with a $800 brick. We also had issues with our warranty start date. Dell claimed our 1 year warranty ended 6 mos after we purchased because the laptop has \"originally been purchased by Microsoft\" 6 mos prior to that. Tried to get the issue resolved with Amazon (who knows when/where they get their laptops, it shouldn't change the fact that the warranty on a \"new\" machine starts for the consumer at the date of purchase), but Amazon just referred me back to Dell who said contact Amazon and around and around we go. Very disappointing experience all around. Will never buy another Dell and will never buy another computer from Amazon."}

This computer is great in the sense that it is powerful, especially for a laptop. The first thing you notice about this laptop is that its fans are going constantly. When plugged in, the computer will randomly go into overdrive, making me a nuisance in public spaces.\n\nBut the real doozy is what happened a year later. Like others have reported, the hinges are absolute garbage. My computer is completely separated at the left hinge, having broken a day after the warranty expired. I called Dell, hoping they would understand and fix the problem, but I was instead informed that even if I had a warranty, this problem is listed as \"Wear and Tear\", therefore exempting Dell from covering it. Apparently daily use is too much for this computer, which I'm guessing is made of toy plastic.\n\nThe computer has continued to deteriorate in quality: depending on where I am, I can't connect to wifi and the strength of signal is significantly weaker than it should be; I have to press down on the left side, which also happens to be the charging side, to get the computer to begin charging; and even the charging cord is beginning to fry. Dell's customer service is despicable, insulting, and infuriating. The lack of interest in my problem has negatively colored my perception of Dell forever.

It is being solely held together via packaging tape. I've never bought such a cheaply built laptop ever before and I never expected this is what would happen to it.  The hinges where the monitor portion meets the actual body of the laptop has completely cracked literally from carefully opening and closing the laptop. The trackpad is the worst I've ever used, by far. It often resets randomly or doesn't pick up on touch. Also, don't expect Dell or Amazon to do anything about this. I contacted both well within the limit of the included Warranty and both of them said \"tough luck.\"\n\nIt's not only issues with the exterior of the laptop. The Wi-Fi was the first thing to go about 6 months into the purchase forcing the use of a wired connection for any internet connection. Now, the Ethernet port is on its last limbs and the computer constantly drops connection every few minutes making any normal task impossible. I've troubleshooted both of these thoroughly and it's come down to shoddy hardware in both occasions.\n\nPlease understand that this is not a quality product.

Now that it has reached a stage when it's not usable anymore, I am leaving this feedback. For a $799 purchase, it didn't deliver the value that I expected. After about one year, the left hinge started coming apart along with a periodic flicker of the screen. For a few months, the flicker would go away when I open/close the display few times or adjust the display screen to certain angles. But the hinge problem kept on worsening and also the amount of time making screen adjustments to get a flickerless display also kept on increasing. Since it's already past the warranty period, I did some research myself and found that both these problems are inherent defects for this Dell model (7559) reported by many users. Anyone can google this model number along with \"hinge problem\" or \"screen flickering\" and find out reported issues. I followed several resolutions given by different users and Dell support staff to fix flickering issue, such as BIOS upgrade, correcting Power Options etc, but none of them helped.\nWhen I returned to write this review on Amazon, I am surprised that Amazon has marked this product with \"Amazon's Choice\" promotional callout - Despite of several consumer reports publicly documented about this product on web forums.

The machine runs well--I purchased the extras to upgrade the storage and memory--but it has a significant design flaw of which you may have already read. When you flip the screen into the up and down positions, it puts an immense about of force on the pivot points which are not designed well. Subsequently, your laptop will begin to pull itself apart from the corners. Your relatively expensive electronic device will quickly rend itself into scraps of junk.

The left hinge on my computer broke about 11 months in.  However, I was just careful opening and closing it and has lasted with no issues since then.  Eventually, my other hinge broke (My fault) and now I am getting it repaired.  I debated buying a new laptop but this one still works so well that I couldn't justify it.  Based on previous performance, I am hoping this laptop continues to last."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "I dropped this on plush carpet about 2 feet and the hinge broke along with the casing/housing, lcd bazel. Okay, my fault as I should have been more careful. After closer inspection I realized there was way way more damage than there should have been. Then I come here and read about the defective left hinge from multiple reviewers. That's where it hit. And it tore the entire casing apart. So now I have to shell out 200 bucks to repair it. Funny, my Sennheiser headphones (280) are built better than this and have dropped those and yet no damage. Maybe Dell should pay Sennheiser a visit to see them work their magic?\n\nNow for some other things I didn't like:\n\n1.) Limited portability. I had this for over a year and lugged it back/forth to the library where I do my work. It is not just heavy, but HEAVY. I'm a big guy and found it cumbersome to lug around. If all you're going to do is leave it on the kitchen table, great. But it's not ideal for travel at all, even down the street to say nothing about lan parties (do they still have those?)\n\n2.) Tiny arrow keys. Just a nitpick really, but since I'm an old-school gamer (I learned to play Doom and Ultima on arrow keys) it's a minus. Never liked using WASD or whatever it is nowadays. I've tried believe me. Maybe it works well for Witcher 3 but not for emulators. Probably not worth docking a star over, however.\n\n3.) Matte screen is almost too matte. Picture quality with 1080p episodes of ST:TNG were drab and colorless, bordering on old 480p TV quality. Go with 4k screen if you can afford it. Yes I know they are $250 or thereabout but if you're a film buff like me you will want one to begin with.\n\n4.) Poor Dell Customer Service. Won't honor any hinge replacement. Not their problem. Really? I barely had this two years and they can't give a poor Joe a break to make him a lifetime customer? Is 'going the extra mile' now verboten in the name of greed?\n\n5.) The fan is LOUD. Like standing behind an F-15 loud, and comes on an odd moments, sometimes when I'm NOT gaming or doing any kind of cpu-intensive stuff. Just strange.\n\n6.) Windows 10 forced updates that destroy desktop/taskbar customizations (Stardock, Start Menu, etc). Don't ask, don't tell seems to be the motto for Microsoft and Dell. Just update without asking or even thinking about getting any kind of permission. I asked a PC repair guy if I could install Windows 7 on this and he said flat out no way. At least with Windows 7 or Linux, I (you know, the OWNER) have the authority to say yea or nay to any and all updates. And why does Windows 10 HAVE to be sending info to Microsoft 24/7?\n\n7.) ONE screw apparently holds the entire back panel together. It broke very easily when I first got it. About 30 to replace."}

I now have to use an external usb or ethernet to connect to the internet at all. Two stars instead of one because it runs games decently for a low-end gaming laptop.

I read a lot of reviews, however, rating gaming laptops based on performance and price, and this laptop was very favorably reviewed.  I am typing this review on this particular computer as we speak and I am so happy I decided to buy this laptop.  It's fast, has good battery life, and has a dedicated graphics card so it actually plays PC games quite well.  It didn't come installed with a lot of junk software (bloatware) which was a huge plus.  This computer has been great for media streaming, word processing, video game playing, and general internet use.  It has 3 USB ports and an HDMI port so you can hook it up to a TV or secondary HD monitor.  I've had zero problems with this computer with the exception of one self-inflicted stupidity: I accidentally put an ethernet cable head into the ethernet port before I had clamped the gold connectors into the ethernet cable.  This, predictably, resulted in killing my ethernet port, but it hasn't been an issue as I normally use WIFI.  I bought a USB to ethernet adapter on the cheap so I can still hook up to wired connection if need be.  Since this review is a few years old at this point, this particular computer will not be \"cutting edge\" anymore.  It didn't have the latest core i7 processor at the time, but it's held up remarkably well and still lets me play current PC games on decent graphics settings.  If Dell has made a more modern version of this gaming unit, I will not hesitate to check it out when this laptop gets too old/slow.  It hasn't shown any signs of quitting or obsolescence yet, though."}

I have a desktop gaming rig and I've literally abandoned it altogether because this laptop is so much more of a joy to use than my desktop.

I absolutely adore this computer, even now a full year + later. My only \"complaint\" (and it isn't really even that much of a complaint) is that because I have fundamentally abandoned my desktop, I wanted to install even more games on this but the 256gb SSD it comes with just can't quite handle everything I want to install so I'll be ordering a replacement SSD with a full TB of space to accommodate what I want to have on here. Load times are fantastic, I don't dread rebooting my rig every time I install/update something as it takes only seconds to go from clicking \"Reboot\" to logging back into my system.

The laptop runs perfectly  fine but every time you go to use it, it feels like its open to tear apart into two pieces. I would absolutely not recommend this laptop!"}

I've sent it back to Dell and as soon as I got it back it was still broken.  You can reinstall the audio drivers and the card will sometimes start to work again, but there is something bigger here and I've wasted about a month of my life dealing with it.  They  recommended reformatting your hard drive - and so I did that reinstalled  everything and the issue came back.  No one knows what it is and I'm tire of being without a working computer.  The customer support for Dell is great, but I'm at the point where Dell just needs to replace the laptop to make me ever want to buy a dell again.  If the computer worked it was great for games and video editing, but as is I can only give it 2 stars."}

I have already had to replace the screen because it cracked merely from the force of closing it.  Also the plastic by the left hinge has broken away and is slowly causing the laptop to split into two halves. This has caused the wireless antenna in the laptop to break and I have to use an external USB adapter to connect to wifi.  I have contacted Dell about this and they have refused to fix it.  I never dropped or otherwise damaged this laptop, it is purely due to Dell's shoddy construction.  Doing research into the issue and it's a known problem with Dell going back, and they refuse to acknowledge or work to repair it.  It is embarrassing that my wife's $100 chromebook is better constructed than this.  Needless to say I will never be buying another Dell ever again.  A definite example of buyer beware."}

I searched for a long time to find a computer that has great specs and a fair price and I finally thought I had found one in the Dell Inspiron. The first Inspiron I bought from amazon had keys fallin of it from the very first day I had it, so I sent it back and received a new computer. The new computer started having speaker issues where the sound would randomly go out and become extremely muffled. After a few weeks of this I finally figured out that screws were not tight enough in the back of the computer. Once I tightened them the sound problem was mostly fixed. Then the next problem occurred. The hinges on these computers are so cheaply made that as you continue to open and close the screen throughout your normal use of the computer, it starts to pull its own casing apart at the hinges. Now, exactly 1 year since I bought the computer, I can no longer open the computer without the casing along the back completely pulling itself apart, almost cracking the computer in half. I have taken excellent care with this computer and am extremely disappointed in amazon.  Sure the specs of the computer are great, but the casing is so poorly designed you will be lucky for it to make it a whole year. You can google the problem I described and see that it's an extremely common problem with this computer. While the specs are great, the design is so bad your computer will quickly fall apart."}

Would recommend, especially with the new version that has the GTX 1050 instead of the 960M.\n\nI am serious shopper when it comes to computers, I spend a ton of time researching my purchases because I know what I want and I know what I am willing to pay. I was in the market for a 15.6\" laptop that had an SSD and a dedicated video card. This laptop meets my requirements, and I am very very happy.\n\nOverall the computer performs admirably. The processor and GPU work well and I am able to accomplish an abundance of school work while also being able to play many of my games. I have played PUBG, FTL, L4D2, Sins of a Solar Empire:Rebellion, SUPCOM2, BeamNG Drive, Unbox, Portal 2, and many others with almost no problems. (PUBG and BeamNG Drive are a little choppy sometimes but they are Early Access). It plays games well! (Not full spec of course but admirably for the hardware).\n\nIt looks good, the red is subtle but still a little showy, and the keyboard fells good to me, although I am not very picky. The screen looks nice and overall i've had no issues at all with it. The pre-applied software is there and it is not too bad. I can't stand Dell Audio, it has a sound setting that just messes the whole thing up (Maxx Audio i think). Other than that getting rid of the junk has not been a problem. I like the trackpad, it stays out of the way when playing and is fairly accurate and usable when you don't want to pull out your mouse. The backlit keyboard is great! The battery life is average, not amazing, but certainly not bad. I have not used the webcam or mic much, but im sure it is standard. The slightly rubbery texture is nice and grippy, although it does dirty easier than some things I guess, but its not bad, and easy to clean!\n\nAll in all I am incredibly pleased so far. I have had no software issues and no hardware issues. It was cheaper than the competition, and it still delivers! The 256 SSD is just about right for me (games & school files). Runs Visual Studio just fine. I can't think of much else. The speakers though, they are......laptop speakers, better than some that i've heard though!"}

Great for games and everyday tasks with enough horsepower to do both at the same time.\n\nOne drawback, however. Do NOT buy Dell Refurbished products. The casing around this laptop started to come apart after about 3 months of use. I found a flaw within its casing where some of the plastic had been warped and then, through light use, had cracked apart. I put in a new screw and sort of jimmy-rigged it the best I could. But, considering it is a plastic case and plastic piece that is holding screws in, my options were limited.\n\nThe screws came lose again while I was gone and my wife informed me that the wifi was not working very well. I take a look inside and, behold! Since it had come loose again, the laptop's metal piece of the casing had pinched and snipped the wire for the wifi card. Would have been simple if it was a simple part replacement, but dell won't just sell a replacement wire. They would take it, of course, and charge me the laptop's price to fix it I'm sure. But considering it was a refurbished product, there was no plan that would cover repairs.\n\nAgain, don't buy refurbished.

If I enable the graphics device in Device Manager I get a \"PC_WATCHDOG_VIOLATION\". After several days of troubleshooting I realized that if I turn the graphics card on my laptop blue screens. I bought this laptop in March of 2016 so unfortunately it's out of warranty. Supposedly this is a common issue and while my laptop is still usable, I can't play anymore of my favorite games.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nBought this around a year ago in March of 2016. Since than I've  had to send it back to Dell in order to fix screen bleed issues. This is my review of one year of moderate to heavy use almost every day. I got the i5-6500 processor with the 256gb ssd and 960M graphics card.\n\nPROS:\n-Quiet. Even under moderate use with Balanced power Settings It's extremely quiet. Fans spin up ever now and than but than quiet back down.\n-Feels nice. Smooth to the touch and quality is acceptable. Keep it my backpack.\n-Good for Gaming: the games you play are dependent on you but I've gotten solid 45-60 fps on Dragon Age Inquisition on High Settings, 60+ FPS on Killing Floor 2 on high settings, and around 45-70fps on Witcher 2 on low settings. The 960M is a great laptop card and so far I haven't had too much trouble running a game.\n-Temps: cooling on this thing is amazing. Never once broke past 70C and even than it stayed quiet. Generally surprised.\n-Battery: Depending on your power options, it lasts anywhere between 2.5-5.5 hours. When I'm at school and have it on balanced power settings with 30% screen brightness it lasts around 4 hours. WHen I'm gaming on High Performance with max screen brightness it lasts around 2 hours. Even after a year of charging and recharging it the battery still remains in excellent condition.\n-Simple Design: I don't want a gaming computer with fancy logos or designs. Just me but i wanted a simple laptop that could handle anything I throw at it.\n\nCons:\n-First Unit came with pretty bad screen bleeding. Had to send it to Dell and took a month to get it fixed and shipped back to me. It's okay now.\n-256gb SSD isn't enough storage if you want to game. Get a 1tb 7200rpm HD or a 500gb SSD as a second drive to store games and stuff. You'll need it.\n-Some bloatware. It came with mcafee and some other stuff  as well as dell proprietary software which I uninstalled. Didn't need it.\n-Trackpad and keyboard is not that great. I reccommend you get a mouse. It's not bad once you get used to it but the trackpad makes it hard to make right or left clicks. You will get frustrated.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nAfter a year of having this PC i don't regret it one bit. It was rough in the beginning with screen bleed issues and such but once that was resolved it proved its worth. I now wish that I spent the extra $100 and go for the i7 version, because now I realize that it might have given me extra FPS in my games. If I were you and looking for a decent laptop under $1000 than this Dell laptop is perfect."}

(I did the former and got a 2 TB one, runs fast enough for me. )\n+ comes with 8 GB of RAM, has a slot so you can upgrade to 16 GB (which I did)\n+ HDMI is good for 60 Hz (60 FPS) gaming.\n- screen is sensitive and must be babied. Even with a laptop sleeve I got some  marks around the center. After 11 months of use. They are minor and easily ignored.\n- No USB 2.0 AND no disk drive makes it difficult to install Win7. I still did it, you just have to have the MB's 3.0 root drivers. Ask me if you'd like me to elaborate"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "I bought this thing in February and wanted to give myself some time to use it before giving my opinion, so here it is.\n\nThis laptop is great for gamers on a budget, if your budget is around $800. I don't do any 3d modeling so I can't say anything on that, however I used this laptop for school and gaming, which it does marvelously. The 256 GB m. 2 ssd is so fast I still have trouble getting used to the 10 seconds it takes to get to the log in screen from start up. They keyboard honestly is an issue, but from my experience it's because I've either not moved my finger to the center of the key or I don't push down. There are times where it will show that I pushed a key twice even though I only clicked it once, but minor annoyances like that do not weigh my opinion down. An earlier review posted in May has mentioned this, but the casing is a HUGE fingerprint magnet. I've gotten into the habit of cleaning the whole thing once a week whenever I get the chance.\n\nNow to get into the details that gamers might want to know. 4gb vram and 8 gb ram will run Doom on high with an average fps of 50-60, Shadow of Mordor flawless 60 or higher, Deus Ex: Mankind Divided I just bought two days ago and tried out for an hour. Never got to check the frame rate there, but I didn't see any stuttering nor did the frames seem to drop below 45. Just keep in mind that you'll probably want to be plugged in when playing more recent games to really keep that high frame rate, but know that you will lose yourself playing whatever you choose because this laptop will run it."}

Overall, I am pleased with it and have no buyer's remorse.  There are some pros and cons that may deter other people from considering this product though.\n\nI bought this because it is difficult to get as much vRAM in a laptop under $1000 as this.  4gb is a still at the price.  Everything else is comparative to most $500+ laptops.  Standard 8gb ram and i5 are rather standard pats for quality laptops.  the 256gm ssd is nice, but leaves you a bit cramped for room.  Keep in mind the witcher 3 is about 60gb alone.  Below is a list of pros and cons.\n\nPros:\nGreat dedicated gpu for the price\nbacklit keyboard\nssd drive\npretty good battery for a gaming laptop\nexpandable storage and ram with an easy to remove back\n\nCons:\nMatt casing leaves lots of ugly fingerprints\nLackluster keys lead to many mistypes\nmore than a fair share of bloatware (as all pcs have now days)\nNot easily replaceable battery\n\nOverall, its a good mid level gaming laptop at an unbeatable value.  if you are not a gamer then skip this model.  Especially if you like to blog then you will be frustrated at the keyboard.  The keyboard is my main reason for docking a star.  That and the annoying bloatware.  If you are a web surfer, then you should go for the acer aspire and save a few hundred bucks, you won't get any extra value here.  This is built for entry level gamers on the move and on a budget"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "Amazing laptop for the price. Plays GTA V, D3, ARM3, Fallout 4, Wow, Skyrim, H1Z1 with ease. I have several other games I play but confident this will handle them with no problem. I usually have a cooling pad I use with my gaming laptop but this one seems to handle the cooling pretty good. I noticed the fans kicking in a lot more as I had longer sessions. I broke it down and thermal paste was dried out on both the CPU and GPU. It purred along after the thermal paste replacement. If you are able I recommend this as the system was released about two years ago. This isn't a simple task. You pretty much have to completely break it down to get to this point.\n\nI used a M17xR4 Alienware for the last 3 years. The $500 GPU died on it so I needed a replacement. I didn't want to spend $1500-2000+ this time so I tried out the Inspiron 15 7559 as a budget setup. I liked the newer version of the 7000 series but wanted to stay closer to the $700 range. This system is more than enough for what I use it for. It feels very light and fragile compared to my M17xR4. The screen is very, very thin and has a small amount of bleeding at the bottom bezel. It's not bad at all. I notice it during game start ups or boot. The inspiron is extremely lightweight vs my other laptop. Its nice for moving around but my M17xR4 had the feel of a very solid build. I didn't have to worry about it feeling so fragile lifting the screen up. I recommend gently lifting it in the middle with a finger around the camera. I would never lift open the screen using one of the corners. It would flex too much for me.\n\nBesides those few issues it's a great little system with a pretty good punch. I stream occasionally and record with OBS while I play most games. It handles this with no problem. Shadowplay works well too. I've used OBS with my Elgato HD on my Xbox and PS4. I use a headset, a mic, external gaming keyboard/mouse and a USB power block. It handled this all just about as good as my desktop if you need mobility or to save space."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "I purchased this laptop late April 2017. Only games I plan to run on it are Path of Exile and Dota 2, both relatively low demanding games. Everything was fine until yesterday when I played my first Dota game. Mid game, my keyboard stopped working, entirely. Alt-F4, Esc, Ctrl+Atl+Del, nothing worked. So, I solely used my mouse to exit the game, and restart the laptop. The laptop then hang at the restart screen, and NOTHING I do would work from then on. Holding down the power button for a minute did nothing because I figured it's part of the keyboard, and thus it wouldn't work. Basically, only way to force shut down is: 1: wait for the battery to drain out  2: take out the battery\n\nAfraid of voiding the warranty, I called Dell. After a bunch of troubleshooting, the technician finally told me to disconnect the battery, and as expected, it worked after that.\n\nHOWEVER, I highly doubt this solves the problem in the long run. I'm afraid this will happen again if I run Dota 2, and only way to figure out is to keep testing it out. I wish Dell would address this problem, and if it happened before and my laptop is one of the unlucky ones, I'd really like a replacement because I got this literally 2 weeks ago."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "I purchased this laptop in late December 2015 and have had multiple problems. The sound coming out of the speakers is bad and tweaking software does not seem to help (the sound is fine with headphones or external speakers). Within a couple of months of purchase, the screen would randomly blank out even though there was still power to the laptop, nothing would respond other than shutting it off. I was on the phone with Dell support for hours and the best they could do was tell me to do a system restore as they assumed it was a software conflict. It didn't help and never got fixed. The most recent is failure of the m. 2 SSD drive, it would not boot so I had to replace the hard drive and the m. 2 256 GB Sandisk SSD can't even be recognized as a regular drive. Because the laptop was 3 months out of warranty Dell would look at it via mail in service only if I prepaid for service and/or an extended warranty. I just did a complete clean reinstall of Windows, without all the extra Dell bloatware, and the computer is working again, though I did end up downloading some items and drivers from Dell, so who knows how long it will last this time. The form factor of the computer is nice and easy to use, it is a bit heavy, battery life is ok (knock on wood), but I cannot recommend this computer after all the problems I have had with it."}

Boot time is dang near instant and the fan rarely kicks on unless I'm pushing it, even then it's almost unnoticeable. Upgraded the RAM almost instantly after purchase so I can't really say how much of a difference there might be between having it 8gb or 16gb.\nThe reason this review is more gravitated towards production and industry use is because I couldn't find one on this unit during my decision to purchase so this is for others who may be looking at this laptop to do similar work.\nIt's not a beefed up desktop but it's worth it's weight in salt as a solid computer for professional use.\nSide Note: I read the quad core i5 model might be slightly more efficient (in some aspects) then the dual core i7, not sure if it's true but blown away regardless."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "Dell 15.6 Inch Gaming Laptop\n6th Gen Intel Quad-Core i-5 6300 HQ Processor up to 3.2 Ghz\n8 GB DDR3\n256 GB SSD\nNvidia GeForce GTX 960M\nWindows 10 OS\n\nHave been using this for 10 months.\n\nI was a bit worried because I could not preview it in-person at a local store, but this purchase has worked well.  Glad I purchased from Amazon seller Seeb Electronics, South Carolina.\n\nincredibly quiet: After the screen saver kicks in (dimming the screen), I need to look at the on-off light to determine if this is on.  With my other PCs generating so much fan noise, I cannot hear this thing at all.\n\nSeems to adapt well to my environment: This replaced an HP laptop what still works (in the winter) but cannot handle 110 degree days.  This Dell has zero problems with heat.  Cools itself well.\n\nkeyboard: I like the keyboard.  Nice feel, smooth, IMO.  I think you could describe it as chiclet style with regular size keys and adequate key separation.  I like the keyboard feel but if you generally do not like chiclet style keyboards, this is not for you.  Keyboard is backlit, so you can use it in pitch dark.  I have never used the touchpad, I turned touchpad off because I do not need it.\n\nI read all the problems experienced by the folks with one, two, and three star reviews - and I have not experienced any of those problems (except the sound thing, which is not an issue, see below).  This Dell has performed perfectly.\n\nScreen: bright, sharp, perfect colors, no yellowing, no bleed, no lines, no dead pixels, absolutely perfect.  Mostly, I extend the display and I use the built-in display in conjunction with an external Dell 25 inch monitor.  So I can run different programs on the two screens, works perfectly.\n\nI am 100% financial markets.  Mostly I use it to stream swim lessons from TD Ameritrade and stream the Tasty Trade Online Financial Network.  Also, use it to access my brokerage accounts.  I never use it for gaming so I cannot comment on use for playing games.\n\nThe wifi works perfectly on both the 2.4 Ghz and 5.0 Ghz bands.  I run it on 5 Ghz because I am the only one using the upper band in an area where there are 30 plus (very close) signals on the 2.4 Ghz band.\n\nMine features a 256 GB SSD.  Has room for additional 2.5 inch SATA SSD drive.  I have not added a second hard drive.  At the time I ordered this, it was not possible to order this exact configuration direct through the Dell web site (in this model).  I like this setup best.  This works for me now.  Nice to know I have the option of an easy upgrade if I need more storage.\n\nMy only negative: Windows 10 64 bit installed.  I do not like Windows 10 because it has silly extras which get in the way.  Would prefer Windows 7 which is superior to Windows 10 for those of us who have work to do.  Windows 8 and 10 are for people who play games on their PC, not for business people.\n\nAudio: Built in speakers are fine.  I have hooked up an external full-size Yamaha amp to drive full size speakers.  Everything works fine.  One thing that you should be aware of - although it is not really a problem - when Windows first fires up on this Dell, a loud audio pulse is sent to the speakers.  So you hear a loud pop at boot-up.  This happens once and only at boot-up.\n\nI have not telephoned Dell once.  I cannot comment on the quality of Dell support.  Actually, I have several Dell products and I have never contacted Dell for service.\n\nBattery Life: When constantly streaming video off the internet, and with the display on max brightness, the battery powers this laptop for about 3 hours.  If you dim the display and/or use this in stand-by mode, time on battery is nearly doubled.\n\nI have not cleaned out the dust yet.  But nice to know that the back cover can be removed easily so the user can clean dust out of the fans.  Never buy HP brand laptops because they must be completely dismantled (takes forever) to vacuum the dust out of the fans and heat sinks.\n\nWould I buy this again?  Yes, I would, in this exact configuration.  Of course, in a few years, my answer will be different as technology moves forward."}

These combined aren't noticeable when browsing or whatnot, but maybe a month after owning it the Battery went bad. I no longer can use the laptop unless it is plugged in, forcing me to leave whatever I had open and kind of ruining the idea of it being more than a lightweight desktop.

The warranty that comes with Amazon purchases is mail-in only, with 12 day wait times each go, and you pay out of pocket for shipping. They simply swapped the hard drive each time because it passed the cut-rate self diagnostic tool that Dell puts on your BIOS as bloatware. This machine was amazing when it ran for the first few weeks. But once it died, it got stuck in a fail to boot cycle, and I got stuck in a fail to fix cycle with Dell Support. Will never buy another Dell again. This was a terribly unreliable product. (Was purchased on Company Amazon account.)"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "I've owned this laptop for just under a week. I purchased it through Amazon Warehouse for $560. It was Used-Like New which means the packaging was damaged, but the product is still brand new. What a steal this was.\n\nI'll start off by saying that I purchased this laptop as I head back to school. I needed portability, a 15\" screen (non touch, I think touch screens are gimmicky, you may feel otherwise), and a discrete graphics card so I can play some games during any downtime. With my school and work schedule, it's probably not going to happen much. I do have a dedicated gaming PC with a 1070 so that gets most of my gaming attention.\n\nPros:\nI got this laptop for an amazing price. For under $600 on Amazon Warehouse, this is an absolute steal. If you compare it to other laptops in the $500-$600 price range, you won't get dedicated graphics nor will you get a true Quad Core processor. You'll get an Intel chip marked with a U at the end meaning it's designed to save power. Not good for gaming.\n\nThis laptop is portable. It fits in my backpack without issue. It adds very little in terms of weight. It feels very portable.\n\nThe Keyboard isn't great, but it's not terrible. Typing feels fine on it. The backlit keyboard is a really nice addition and can be cycled through Dim, Bright, or Off.\n\nGaming on it is really good. My last laptop was 10+ years ago. I paid nearly double for it and it didn't have dedicated graphics, it was massive, and it played my games like hot garbage. So far, I've only tested two games. World of Warcraft: Legion and Diablo 3. Diablo 3, as expected, was around 90FPS dipping to 70FPS in spell heavy areas. World of Warcraft was playable at 60FPS at default setting of 5. I haven't played around with the settings too much, but I was locked at the screen refresh rate of 60hz (fps) and didn't see a single dip. I upped the view distance and dropped shadows a bit.\n\nThe SSD is lightning fast. I've only recently been introduced to them on my gaming PC so it was a great addition to this laptop. Boot times are super fast, programs open very quickly and are responsive, and games load really well. The other benefit that I didn't realize until using it, is this laptop is dead silent. No clicking hard drive, no vibration from the platters spinning, nothing. Unless you are playing a game and the fans get going, you won't hear a thing from this laptop. I will likely add a 250-500 gigabyte hard drive as the 256SSD just isn't enough space to store all of my games and files. Luckily you can find HDD drive space for really cheap.\n\nCons:\nThe screen isn't great. I'm a little impressed as my expectations were low after reading reviews, but it's not an amazing screen. Luckily enough for me, I've had zero light bleed. Even in a dark room on boot, I don't notice any light bleed.\n\nBuild Quality. I don't know how it's going to hold up. It seems sturdy, but there is some screen flex in the bottom middle of the screen. The plastic guards on the fans seem like they would be easy to break too.\n\nSpeakers. Really nothing to write home about. I'm not an audiophile, so I can't describe exactly what is wrong with them, but they just sound...meh. Get headphones and you won't have to worry about it.\n\nTrackpad: It's pretty bad. Probably the worst thing about this laptop. It's not accurate, it's jumpy and doesn't feel good. Get a wireless mouse with it. I did. Luckily this is an issue that can be remedied for as little as $10 with a mouse. If you are planning on gaming, you won't want to use the track pad anyway.\n\nOverall:\nThis is insane bang for your buck. If you want a laptop that you could play games on for a good price, this is it. It's a \"sleeper\". I saw one top review mentioned that its easy to sneak it past the wife as a work laptop when really, it can easily handle most games. It also doesn't scream \"STEAL ME\" with flashy RGBs and gawdy accents. I was fortunate enough that this laptop dropped $100 in price the day I was going to buy it. That right there is enough for a cooling pad and a HDD to complete what is an amazing computer. Just buy it already!"}

It was frustrating and I couldn't find a solution online so I just turned off the ELAN software and disabled it's run on start up setting and haven't had to deal with it since.

They work great for gaming and regular use.  It has an exceptional battery life for everyday usage, and even while gaming I still get several hours of battery life.  An additional feature that I like about this laptop is that it doesn't really get hot.  There are large vents and a good fan, and it is very rare that the fan switches to high (even while gaming or watching movies).  This was a very pleasant change after using toasty laptops for years.\n\nI personally have not done so to my computer, but adding in an extra 1TB hard drive to my husband's laptop was very easy.  The laptop is actually very compact and not that heavy when you consider the extra large battery and other components that come with a gaming laptop.  After months of use I have no complaints or issues with either of our (identical) laptops."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "Well rounded spec-wise, however, this particular laptop model has its fair share of quirks. I purchased mine second hand from Amazon's warehouse deals some time ago. When I originally got it, I was aware of some quirks people were facing, however, as a tech enthusiast who enjoys tinkering and figuring things out I figured it wouldn't be an issue. Originally, I had little to no issues. A big issue at the time I had bought it had to do with the wireless card, however, I lucked out and no problems were present besides some mild backlight bleed that was abysmal. Jump forward a year after a number of BIOS updates, fixes, and other things, I can now say this laptop is an annoyance. The screen has become permanently dimmed and there's at least one location where there's a circle that's brighter than the rest of the screen. Another issue I've run into with the screen involves gaming. While gaming, I've had diagonal screen tearing while playing various games. It's extremely noticeable and annoying, however, I believe I have resolved the issue by turning off Vsync in the Nvidia Control Panel. In regards to game performance the card is pretty weak. It works for your basic games, however, if you're thinking of playing something like the recent DOOM even at lower settings and resolutions it's not even worth it. You may be able to pull off a steady framerate but the frame timing is horrendous and the gameplay will still feel choppy!\nFor school use, I've been using it daily for quite some time now. It has served me well for the most part, however, with the screen being so dim now I find it hard to multi-task on. I've played around the Intel control panel to calibrate the brightness and contrast but there's only so much you can do. I've also noticed more recently that this laptop gets incredibly hot, in the beginning I monitored temps and I was quite impressed but unfortunately that's no longer the case. It gets hot and the fans start blaring on and off during class while taking notes. Not only is it a distraction, it's also pretty annoying when everything's dead silent and suddenly you hear a plane take off.\n\nAt the moment there's really not much else for me to say, it has decent specs and still works... if I recall anything I'll be sure to update my review."}

After 2 months of owning this laptop I already have a patch of dead pixels across on the right side of my screen. I have done nothing but take the laptop between rooms and open and shut it but apparently that is too much for this poorly crafted piece of machinery. I tried contacting customer service to resolve the dead pixels issue but they were completely useless. They offered me the option to send my laptop to them for 2 weeks WITHOUT a temporary. This is not an option for students who want the best of both worlds both gaming and working because customer service will leave you high and dry when it comes to keeping you productive. Never in my life have i experience customer service that does not give you a temporary when they give you an inferior product. Additionally, customer service warned me that if i send it I should back up everything in case they have to wipe the thing clean. So not only would I be out of a computer for 2 weeks but also need to buy an external hard-drive if I don't already own one?? And there's no guarantee you'll fix it?? Umm yeah, no thanks.

I edit art and photos so I was attracted by the specs and promised good performance for what I need it for, but I can't even use the internet with it.\n\nRight out of the box it gave me an error screen that said \"no boot device found\". After adjusting the settings several times in BIOS I was able to get it to boot up, but it's agonizingly slow. I tried to download Firefox, but it was still at 9% after nearly an hour. I never could get it or anything else to download. Many webpages never open at all. It only loads blurry thumbnails or empty squares in image searches and takes a minute or more to load low resolution jpegs. I can't open Tumblr at all, and most images on deviantART won't load even the preview size. The whole system is sluggish, often not responding to clicks and taking too long to open menus. I tried both enabling and disabling Speedstep, optimizing the performance settings, manually changing the Paging File settings, everything that is suggested online to improve this, with no results. I tried completely restoring to factory settings and reinstalling Windows just in case I messed something up the first time, but the same problems persisted. I reset it to factory three times with the same results.\n\nI thought it had to be a lemon, but my partner bought the same one and had all of the exact same problems right out of the box. I can't express my disappointment and sadness that I spent almost a grand on something that is literally unusable. I've heard people rave about playing Bioshock Infinite on this thing, but if I can't even open a jpeg without a struggle, if I tried to install a game I think it would crash. I have no idea why this is happening to both of us, but I'm returning it tomorrow and never bothering with a Dell again.\n\nI don't know if it's a Windows 10 problem or a problem with the computer itself, but either way it's unacceptable."}

Recently, I've started having issues with the charger not being recognized despite me using a genuine charger that is completely functional (it still powers the laptop when I remove the battery). This is apparently a very common issue with Dell chargers and has to do with the communications between the charger and power management on the laptop. So, I can only assume based on the time that it failed, that the failure is engineered. How better to make someone go out and buy new hardware than to have it fail right after warranty? Lots of companies do this but that really doesn't make it okay. It's a disgusting practice that should be stopped. That being said, with the price of this laptop being as low as it is, I don't mind going out and buying a new charger.

I added the extra stick of memory bringing this laptop up to 16gb's. What I found was this computer with a quad core processor and a solid state hard drive handled the heavy demands of the programs I ran fast and without any slow behavior.\n\nUpgrading the memory was also easy with an access to the internals via a door on the bottom. No removal of keyboard or minor surgery to get to the important bits.\n\nThe solid state hard drive is on the small side however since this machine is dedicated to programming I had no need for large 1TB sized solid state drives for the simple purpose of having space. I can always add a drive for storage later as it's got space for that as well. I'll run my OS and major programs on the solid state hard drive and if needed use a second drive for storage. No need for it to run as fast as a solid state.\n\nIs it heavy on software loads??? Just about as clean of a software load as you can get. Pretty much Zero Bloatware to contend with. One exception: McAfee but I hardly call that bloat.\n\nAbout the Hardware:\nI had no need for touch screen so this fit my needs great, the mouse function works fine but I prefer a $12 wireless better. Screen resolution is great. There is a bit of flex to the screen top but I've not noticed any issues with it. I've yet to use the camera so no opinion on that. It  has 3 USB and an HDMI out.

The i5 configuration is more than adequate considering most games only utilize 25%-50% of the CPU. The display is awesome, 1080p doesn't bog down the GPU as much as a 4K display would and because it's an IPS display the colors are very vibrant. The computer runs fairly quiet under load and stays respectively warm. The overall build quality and design is why it doesn't have an alien logo on it, but it's pretty sharp for a budget PC.\n\nThe speakers...\nI was simply astounded by the sound quality. The speakers have never been over 80% and they have great bass thanks to the subwoofer.\n\nAll in all, best PC you can find under $800. All though a 1 TB hard drive is great for space, it doesn't compete with the SSD in the base configuration. The PC boots in under 5 seconds, and gives you a 2.5\" bay to expand and add another drive.

But, this rubberized whatever it is makes me want to change laptops.\n\nI can't bring myself to give it a poor review just because of one bad design decision. But, at the same time, I am literally shopping for alternatives because I dislike the finish that much. I've actually been considering having it wrapped in vinyl just so I don't have to deal with it. That's how much it bugs me. But, otherwise, it is a great little laptop."}

Do NOT waste your money on this garbage. A while ago, I contacted both Amazon and Dell about a clicking noise my laptop was making every time I opened and closed it. Amazon said Dell would be responsible, and Dell refuses to honor the warranty that came with it. That clicking noise progressed, and this is what my laptop now looks like. I literally have treated this laptop like a baby since the day I got it, and this is what it looks like. I have always owned Dells, so I thought I would be happy with this purchase, but NO! I will never buy from Dell again as long as I live. They refuse to honor their products, they are maufacturing complete garbage, and are absoutely horrible to deal with. I've spent 15+ hours talking to them, probably close to 8 different people, and NONE have been even somewhat decent to deal with. Go buy ANYTHING but this laptop, OR a Dell!! I cannot open my laptop any further, and I cannot close it either."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "I bought this primarily so I could do both gaming and video-editing when I'm traveling, and for the cost it definitely doesn't disappoint. I haven't actually done much editing with it (I have a high-end PC as well) but working with Premiere CS6 on this has been great. As for gaming, the only recent game that just doesn't run well enough on it regardless of settings is DOOM, which is a bit disappointing, but it is a very hardware-intensive game so it's not too surprising. Other games like GTA V however run like a dream, even on fairly high settings.\n\nAs pictured, I have added another stick of memory as well as a WD black performance hard drive. Some people had said that adding a hard drive such as this would have a significant impact on the battery life but I have seen very little. I can still get 2-3 hours of gaming (depending on the game) on this while on a plane, which is great. I'd also like to note that the hard drive bay is empty in this laptop, so if you get one like I did, it's super easy to install as you don't have to replace anything. One of the two memory slots is also open, so adding another stick of that is also very simple. Thankfully there's only one plate on the bottom of this that covers these areas and there's only one screw holding it in place. I especially loved this since my first 10+ year old laptop had like a thousand of them.\n\nMy only issues with this thing that are worth mentioning are Windows 10 (which I have far too many issues with but this isn't the place for that) and a certain part of the outside design of the laptop, which I have taken photos of. The little plastic pieces that guard the heatsinks on the back and side can break very easily. And I mean /very/ easily. On top of that, when they do break, the metal bits of the heaksink itself can bend and fold together. That's honestly an easy fix, you can use anything that is thin enough to get in there and bend them back, but the plastic pieces are obviously different. As you can see in my photos, I have super-glued a few of them back on, and I'm straight-up missing a couple others. It's not like it's a massive issue or anything, especially if you don't plan on moving this thing around a lot, but if you travel with it like me, it's something you need to keep in mind. Otherwise I think the overall build quality is pretty good.\n\nI guess the only other thing worth noting is the so-called sub-woofer. Technically it is a sub, but it's like the size of my thumb, and chances are you will rarely ever notice it. That being said, the speaker sound is still pretty good, just don't expect anything from the sub.\n\nOverall, it was totally worth the cost and I would recommend it for anybody wanting something that's both affordable and has the power to run /almost/ any game currently on the market."}

It seemed to be either no dedicated graphics or this beast. But its a great laptop. I use Ubuntu on it mostly, and that was a massive headache because I tried to install Ubuntu 14 and there was all sorts of issues with the Nvidia driver compatibility and what not. Because of this, the laptop would crash after sleeping, and often crash when shutting down. Even trying to install Ubuntu required me to disable secure boot, fast boot and add a nomodeset parameter to the grub (sourced from internet forums for this specific model).\n\nI then tried installing Ubuntu 16, and it didn't require any additional driver installs apart from what Ubuntu installs as part of its standard updater. I used the screenshot as attached to keep things running smoothly. I guess this config means that the Nvidia graphics is not being used, but I'm ok with that because I don't use any graphics intensive applications on Ubuntu anyway. On Windows, the graphics really kick in and the visuals on games are quite stunning."}

I wanted a medium weight 15 inch gaming laptop for travel and portable use at home. I already have a heavyweight 17 inch gaming laptop and I didn't want to haul it around. Considering performance, flexibility and maintainability the Dell i7559 seems to fit pretty well. I am on an extended trip at this time and the Dell was convenient to haul from transport in and out of hotels. Be warned, their is no internal optical drive. I just happen to have a nice portable optical drive but I have not yet needed to use it. Note, if you connect an optical drive you will need DVD player software. On the performance side the Dell does as well as my heavyweight on the games I have played lately. The 256 GB SSD boot drive makes for quick startup and overall performance. For flexibility I have not felt the need to add a second SODIMM to the open memory slot, the installed 8 GB is working for me. The laptop is delivered with an open slot for a 2nd hard drive. There is even the correct connection kit included. I installed a 7200 rpm 1 TB drive in there. This brings up maintainability. Flip the laptop over and the entire bottom panel is removable with one screw for access to most components. I discovered the real reason for this is the only way to access the battery, so if you delve into the innards always unplug the battery first. The 2nd drive is where I load the vast majority of applications and data to keep the boot drive less than full. I have not yet used it outside or on battery so I cannot comment on that. The keyboard is backlit, a major item for me with any laptop. It is possible to open the screen with one hand...slowly. Their are two USB 3.0 ports on the left and another USB 3.0 on the right.  Also on the right are ethernet and HDMI ports with an SD card slot. The Bluetooth works OK with a Bluetooth mouse. The WiFi and ethernet also work perfectly. I used the wireless in a half-dozen or so different environments with no connection or operation issues. I am now using it at 433 MB/sec speed. Dell support is OK. I had extensive experience with Dell support working with IT support and it is usually very dependable. See the photos for a view of the bottom and guts. I will answer any relevant questions."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "PLEASE READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW\n\nI Bought the Dell Inspiron 7559 from Amazon for $650 open-box deal. This one is with the 256gb Solid State Drive. Everything I wrote is based on that model and not the one with the 1 TB slow 5400 RPM mechanical drive. It's important to know that because a lot of video reviews online on this laptop are based on the 1 TB version.\n\nWithout a doubt the best feature of the Dell Inspiron 7559 is the hardware. With my config you get a 256 GB pcie ssd, quad-core i5 and a 4GB Geforce 960m graphics. You also can add a 2.5 inch drive, extra memory by removing one screw from the bottom. This allows you to do video editing, photoshop work, and medium to even high gaming. At this price point, that's almost impossible to beat from what I've seen. Most CPU's provided at this price point are dual-core CPU's, not quad. That, to me, is the first and foremost benefit of the 7995.\n\nMoving on to the rest..\n\nThe screen is good. Not spectacular, but good. I now prefer the 1080p screen to these ridiculously high resolutions which just require more scaling which just creates more problems. The screen could be brighter as it's a little on the dim side but it has good contrast levels and the color is what I would describe as solid. The screen itself is \"pleasing\" considering the price point. I find the laptop 100% usable without ANY SCALING! Scaling has proven to be a big problem with older applications and more and more laptops are coming with QHD and 4K Resolutions which create difficult to overcome scaling issues. You simply won't have that on this laptop and is one of the big reasons I can recommend it. You may want to increase the scaling to 125% which seems to work with most apps. It's when you have to scale it up ridiculously that you start getting some odd issues. That will depend though on the software/apps you use.\n\nThe speakers are loud and generally do sound good. When Dell's audio enhancement's are turned on you can have times where the audio sounds distorted but generally that's not an issue. You can disable it but then the speakers are more muted. I personally went in and set my own settings in the equilizer and now it sounds good after disabling dell audio's settings. There's a speaker on the bottom they claim is a subwoofer but honestly it just sounds like another speaker. Oddly enough, if you play music it sounds even better with the laptop upside down. LOL\n\nThe fans, when doing internet surfing, and web browsing is virtually unnoticable. When I updated the bios the fans roared, as they do on all laptops, but there's no annoying fan noise for simple things like Youtube, chrome being open, etc. Some of the dual-core CPU's throttle that fan on for basic tasks. This laptop seems to cool passively a lot, which helps tremendously for fan noise and battery life. Battery life for non-gaming seems really good. 8 hours or more is probably possible depending on tasks. But once GPU kicks in, I would imagine you may be able to get 2 hours or so.\n\nThe keyboard is good. Not great, but good. The trackpad kind of sucks. The surface isn't real smooth and it's kind of jittery. I always speed my mouse up all the way and it does not help. I mean it works for basic scrolling and web surfing but anything more than that and you'll be pining for a mouse.\n\nThe Bad: When I first powered it on, I kept getting errors installing updates and new programs like Chrome. Being the nerd that I am, I always prefer to just format the drive and do a fresh install of Windows 10. This turned out to be more difficult than I'd hoped. I first tried to just reset Windows 10, but that failed. Good thing I have Windows 10 installer on USB because I was able to format the 256 GB SSD and do a complete clean install of Windows 10. However, in order to do this I did have problems with the UEFI secure BIOS not letting me select the USB device for install. Long story made short, I was able to get Windows 10 fresh installed and that's when the laptop started working smoothly. I suspect the errors I had may have been why the laptop was \"open box\" to begin with? And with how tricky it was to get the BIOS settings figured out, this could be a big problem for buyers. I almost don't recommend it if you're not technically savvy or know someone who is.\n\nThe materials make the laptop feel cheap and plastic, because it is. This does not (to me) feel like a premium laptop and I suppose it shouldn't. Most of the money is in the hardware. But at the end of the day, I do not want to return this laptop. I love it's upgradability and I already plan on doubling the RAM and adding in a 2 TB mechanical drive because this laptop might be one of the most easy to upgrade of it's kind.\n\nSo in short, if you're looking for an affordable laptop to handle business and gaming I think this is worth a look. With this laptop you're sacrificing the premium materials on the outside for higher specs on the inside - and I am okay with that trade off. I have an ASUS UX305ca laptop which has a QHD screen. It's extremely light and has a very high resolution - yet it struggles with the color yellow! and the touch screen disables after sleep mode. The outside, however, feels so premium and smooth. My point is just to point out that ALL laptops have strengths and weaknesses. It looks good, just not high-end premium. I highly recommend this laptop provided you can install Windows 10 fresh should you need too. Maybe other people can comment on if they had problems with this laptop with it's stock O.S. installed."}

First thing I did when it came was open the bottom case and pop in an extra 8GB of ram and drop a 2.5\" drive in the open and waiting drive bay. Both installed with no drama. Then I removed the McAfee, DropBox, etc... and installed Chrome and Steam. Here are initial impressions:\n\nGaming:\nMy Steam library contains hundreds of games, but I basically play Rocket League and Borderlands 2. Both run at max settings with no problems. I also booted up GTA V for giggles and framerate remained steady. Fans kick on when you start playing, but it's not bad at all, and the system stays pretty cool.\n\nOffice:\nReviews of the keyboard were mixed, but I like it. It reminds me a little of the MacBook Air keyboard, but with springier keys. The trackpad is a little small and touchy, but I got used to it pretty quickly.\n\nChrome:\nObviously runs great.\n\nOther thoughts:\nBattery seems really solid, somewhere between 5-7 hours, maybe more. Screen is bright and easy to read. Speakers are loud (turn off MaxxAudio eq, they sound much better without it). It charges pretty quickly too.\n\nReally there's not much to complain about. I'm coming from a three year old MacBook Air so yeah, it's twice the weight and a good bit bigger but it's to the point where if I am bothering to do something on a laptop and not my iPhone I don't mind it being big. Getting a discrete Nvidia card, SSD, 1080P IPS for this coin... that's crazy. Thanks Dell and Amazon!"}

In short:\n1. CPU is not as promised\n2. Port speed is not as promised\n3. Software support from Dell is not as promised.\n\n1. CPU\nInstalling the Intel Processor Identification Utility from Intel (R), I found it recognized the chip is supposed to be an Intel (R) Core(TM) i6-6300HQ CPU @2.30GHz.  Thus, you, me and Intel's software expect 2.30 GHz performance. But only 2.19GHz is reported by Intel as the operating frequency. Long story short, this appears to be a Dell configuration issue and Intel recommended contacting Dell. Too late for me, I suggest you try this test on or before your next purchase.\n\n2. Port speed\nFound  that only one USB port (left side toward back) is high speed. The others are USB 3.0 compatible but not high speed. I have tested against a variety of drives.  Let me give you some examples:<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/SanDisk-Extreme-CZ80-64GB-USB-3-0-Flash-Drive-SDCZ80-064G-GAM46/dp/B00KT7DOSE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">SanDisk Extreme CZ80 64GB USB 3.0 Flash Drive - SDCZ80-064G-GAM46</a>&nbsp;I ran benchmarks on each of the USB ports on this laptop. Here's what I found.:\nRight side (next to Ethernet): The Flash drive benchmarks at 40 MB/sec write and 40 MB/sec read\nLeft side (toward front) The same Flash drive benchmarks at 40 MB/sec write and 40 MB/sec read\nLeft side (toward back) The same Flash drive benchmarks at 177 MB/Sec write and 204 MB/sec read\nThat's a 5x performance difference! I found similar differences in performance testing using WD Passport drives and other Western Digital external drives. (Actual values are different for each drive, but the HUGE performance difference on the ports is the same across all drives.)\n\nThe DELL laptops currently shipping are newer models than mine, but you need to be aware that DELL seems to do this on all their units, providing one decent high speed USB 3.0 and several low performance USB 3.0 \"compatible\" ports without telling you the difference.\n... cutoff review :("}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "Great overall experience from Amazon, fulfillment company, and Dell. I passed on some \"newer\" well-priced laptops which, after reading the specs and reviews, I realized had cut corners. This Dell got high marks for the screen (FHD with IPS & matte finish) and its internal layout. Opened up the laptop chassis by undoing a single screw. Motherboard well laid out, easy access to wireless card, SSD (if I want to upgrade), and empty 2.5\" drive bay. Night and day difference from the last 4 laptops (Gateway & HPs) which were an upgrading nightmare.\nFirst experience with an M.2 SSD, all my laptops for last 4 years have all had 2.5\" SSDs. Comparison ratings say it's middle of the pack but snappy enough for what I need. Included Dell software gave a smooth BIOS update and clean & quick Win10 update (laptop OS must have been from before the big update in 2016). So included software seems to be helpful and not bloat ware.\nKeyboard has good feedback and it's nice having a laptop big enough to have a numeric keypad.\nDisclaimer: I wanted a low- to mid-range gaming laptop. So this will has limitations - 256GB SSD; 8GB DDR3L (vs DDR4); Nvidia GTX 960M 4GB (good for medium game settings, not high); Core i5-6300HQ (on par with my 4th gen i7-4790); 1080p FHD vs. 4K; plastic chassis vs. thin sexy aluminum case; Intel wireless-ac/BT 3160 (vs. 7260 or serious gamer wifi - but's easy to replace). So not set up for, or capable of, an insane gaming experience. I got mine off Amazon warehouse, so for a laptop under $650 I'm very happy."}

Despite that their are new ones announced (as of Jan 2017) that add the new 1050 video card to it, for the price, this is a solid machine. I added a 500GB spinning drive and upped the memory to the 16GB limit, but otherwise this is a great laptop. My kids don't play hardcore high demanding video games, but this handles most games quite well. I bought 3 of these (2 from BH Photo as there was a limit of 1 here, and 2 there), and all 3 are fantastic. I did get this here for the six-fifty price, which is a bit lower than sold for now, so doubly worth it. Not much you can do on this machine. I also ended up getting a laptop fan cooler, just to be safe so when kids are gaming there are fans blowing underneath to help keep things cool.\n\nDo yourself a favor if interested in this, and look/wait for the new model announced in Jan 2017 to see the pricing. With a much faster video card, and possibly updated memory and such, it may be worth waiting a bit and getting that one."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "I got this to replace my MacBook because I was 1) tired of not being able to play decent games and 2) tired of Apple overall. I haven't used Windows in quite some time, as I prefer Linux, so there was a bit of a learning curve. Frankly speaking, Windows is still garbage. BUT... it's a necessity if you care about gaming, so that's that.\n\nThe laptop itself. I owned a Dell years ago and going from memory, this one seems MUCH nicer in terms of build quality and aesthetics. Sure, it's no MacBook, but it's a slick looking computer and I definitely don't have any complaints about the black/red combo, as those are my favorite colors.\n\nThe keyboard (the one I'm using to type this now) is perfectly fine, in my opinion. Would I use it for gaming? No. But for everyday use, I wouldn't change anything about it. It being backlit is a nice touch, though that should just be standard in today's laptops. The trackpad, however, is just... bad. There's no way around that. It's bad. If you're considering getting this laptop, you'll be much happier with a mouse. Trust me. The trackpad will work for when you're on the go, but I try to avoid it as much as possible.\n\nI know the 960m isn't new or top of the line by any means, but coming from computers that have only ever had Intel graphics, this was a huge step up for me. It's run every game I've thrown at it thus far. No, not at ultra high settings or anything crazy, but it will chug along just fine with high or medium quality on most games in my experience. I really have no complaints about that. This is an entry level gaming laptop, not a high end pro one. As long as you set your expectations accordingly, I don't think you'll be disappointed.\n\nThe display is okay. I opted for the non-touch FHD instead of the UHD. I didn't want to deal with upscaling, and I really don't have any use for a touch screen. I mostly have this laptop connected to an external display over HDMI for gaming. When browsing the web or doing spreadsheets, etc the display is good enough.\n\nSound... again, I usually have this hooked up to an external display and speakers, so I can't comment too much on the sound quality. It's... alright? I've never come across a laptop that I was blown away by the sound quality, so this isn't a mark against Dell or this laptop. It's just reality. Laptop speakers kinda suck and using a headset or external speakers will always be the better way to go. That said, they're not terrible by any means. The little subwoofer on the bottom does add some depth.\n\nI'd definitely recommend going with all SSD (and adding another SSD tbh) and adding at least another 8GB of RAM. Small investment to really round out this already solid laptop.\n\nOverall, I'm extremely happy with this laptop and its performance, especially for the price. There are better laptops out there. There are better looking laptops out there. But this one was perfect for me. Do your research, take your time comparing specs and things like upgradability. There IS a new version of this laptop coming out, so keep that in mind as well. Buy what makes you happy :)"}

Not sure why this happens, but now that I use Chrome I don't have that issue."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "PERFORMANCE\n(I own the i5 model with the base 8GB RAM)\nI have found this laptop's general performance quite good.\n8 GB RAM should not be a limiting factor for most usage cases. During normal use ( several LibreOffice documents open / 10 ~Chrome tabs / Music + PDF documents open) I rarely see the usage going over 4 GB. In gaming  8 GB is enough for everything; the bottleneck will be the GPU, not the RAM.\nI am considering adding another 8GB, but it is mostly because I code and the extra 8 GB would be useful in some niche cases (running Linux & IDEs on virtual machines), but the PC really works fine as is\nThe processor is overkill for most general tasks (browsing, word processing, etc) and I have rarely seen any lag - It handles  20+ plus Chrome tabs at once without causing the browser to hang. In gaming once again the processor is more than enough and the bottleneck will be the GPU.\nThe GPU (a gtx 960m) is pretty good compared to other laptops in the same price range. It will handle any game you desire (including recent AAA titles), but do not expect insane performance, it can compete toe-to-toe with a PS4 but will be outclassed by serious gaming PCs: you can expect to run the most demanding titles @ 1080p/Medium/30fps. Esport games will usually run at maximum settings with 60+ FPS. For reference, here are a few games I played:\n- Far Cry 4 @1080p/Very High/30fps\n- Deus Ex: Mankind Divided @1080p/Medium/30 fps (I switched to 900p to crank some of the settings up to high)\n- Deus Ex: Human revolution @ 1080/maximum settings/60+ fps\n- Overwatch, @1080p/Ultra/60+ fps\n- Bioshock Infinite @ 1080p/Ultra/45 fps\n- Mass Effect (all 3) @1080p/Maximum settings/60+ fps\n- Counter- Strike @ 1080/Ulra/60+ fps\n(Do note that now that the gtx 10xx series laptops are out the 960m's performance looks very middling compared to a 1060. If you are really serious about your laptop being your main gaming machine I would recommend investing a bit more and getting a laptop with a gtx 1060)\n\nI was agreeably surprised with this PC's thermal performance. During most tasks (I.E. when not gaming) the PC will remain entirely silent - unlike many other PCs of its caliber. When I did run games, fan noise stayed within very acceptable levels and the keyboard and trackpad remained cool - not a small feat compared to many other gaming laptops I have used. As a result I have not noticed any thermal throttling -even after hours of continuous play.\n\nThe SSD is fine. Windows will boot in ~12 seconds. Programs  and documents open relatively quickly, and I have never felt the computer to be truly slow. It is slower than the PCLI or NVMe SSDs found on higher-end laptops, but not to the point that it makes the experience unenjoyable, and for the price I cannot complain.\n\nKEYBOARD & TOUCHPAD\nThe keyboard was good enough. The keys are full-sized and well spaced out. The key travel is smaller compared to some other laptops (I found it akin to a macbook air), but it is more a matter of personal preference. I have had no difficulties typing on this laptop. The numpad is a niche touch (for those who code or do maths on their laptop - I do), and so is the backliting. I do not have any complaints about either.\n\nThe trackpad was another pleasant surprise. I came in expecting it to be pretty mediocre. Its huge size ended up being a non-issue: I feared the size would result in my palm accidentally pressing it all the time but the palm rejection works great in practice. I have not had any issues with the trackpad's precision. All your standard windows trackpad gestures work as expected. Admittedly I have used bettertrackpads (with smoother glass surfaces etc.. ) but this one was perfectly functional.\n\nSOUND & SCREEN\nThe speakers produce good enough sound. They can get loud, without too much distortion. The subwoofer helps with the bass. Overall I have no issues watching movies with the speakers. My (relatively high-end) headphones do produce far more detailed sound than the speakers when listening to music, but that is probably the case with most laptop's speakers.\n\nThe screen is OK. Its 1080p resolution means images look sharp enough, and its viewing angles are satisfying (as its an IPS panel). The color palette appears a bit muted compared to higher-end screens (it covers only about 72% of the RGB gamut). Wether it will be an issue depends on your use case: I you intend to do photo/video editing, web development or anything else that requires high color precision on this laptop you should go somewhere else. I mostly code and do schoolwork with the occasional games/movies thrown in so it has not proven a real sticking point for me. Additionnaly, I sometimes wish the screen could go a bit brighter, but this is not really problematic as the display is matte, making readable enough  in direct light / outdoors.\n\nBUILD\nThe laptop's design looks good enough, even sleek if black slabs are your thing - certainly not as ridiculous as some other gaming laptops out there.\nThe size and bulk are manageable. I have no real  issues carrying it around with me: it fits in most backpacks and the weight is OK,. Do not be mistaken -  this is no Surface or Macbook Air: you will feel its weight and it is best moved from one desk to the other rather than carried around with you all day. I personally do not mind the hefty dimensions as it means less thermal throttling and better battery life.\n\nThe build quality was my only legitimate issue with this laptop. The base is solid enough- with a metal frame and covered in hard plastic- . Genreally the construction doesn't feel seamless, there are very visblegaps between the different pieces (mostly an aesthetic issue)-  The keyboard fares decently, although the plastic definitely feels fragile. The soft-touch cover feels nice, but is easily dented when bumped into about anything (should not be a  major issue, it only detracts from the otherwise nice aesthetic, especially if you are carefyl) if you are careful). The biggest problem is with the screen: first, it is slightly wobbly (but not to the point that it moves while you type), and flexes very easily - caution is recommended. The hinge is the weakest point: it feels fragile, wobbly and will likely be the first part to break ( a common flaw on laptops).  After six months of ownership, the screen occasionally disconnects and go black when at its lowest positions  due to the wobbling in the hinge (probably a poor contact between the connection wire and the screen). It is nothing horrible as you just need to straighten up the screen to reestablish the connection, and only affects some precise usage scenarios, but this detract from an otherwise decent experience. (The 5th star was removed for the build quality)\n\nBATTERY LIFE & OTHERS\nThe battery life is excellent for a laptop in this category. Despite the relatively powerful CPU and GPU I am able to get at least 8 hours on normal use (browsing, video, text editing/coding @40% brightness). With more aggressive setting you can easily squeeze over ten hours out of it. Battery life while gaming is more variable but who games on battery anyway?. Overall, I was impressed by the battery life, esp compared to my friends' gaming laptops that struggled to get past 4 hours.\n\nAll the ports you expect are there (HDMI, jack, SD, Ethernet.) I particularly appreciate the presence of the  three USB-A ports. ( No USB-C, which will not be  a problem for most people). Note that there is no DVD drive. Nowadays most games can be installed without a DVD these days, but I have still bought an external drive to play my older early 2000s games. It has not bothered me.\nThe webcam & mic work. I did not see a difference compared to other mid-to-high-end laptops.\nThe Laptop is very easily opened up - 1 screw and you are done. Adding an extra SSD or RAM stick is very easy and so are repairs/ maintenance (even should you want to replace that hinge)\n\nCONCLUSION\nThis laptop offers extremely solid performance, and is easily expandable should you wish so. Input devices are good, but nothing to go home about. The screen and sound are normal for the price range. Even the battery life is good: this PC is well-suited to most tasks- just don'y play rough with it."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "This laptop was everything I was looking for and what it said it would be. I was in need of a serious laptop upgrade. As a graphic designer using mostly the Adobe sweet I needed something that could pull more than the average consumer laptop and I am also part of the quite group of designers who don't use Apple products. While they are brilliant they tend to be one trick ponies, I have no intention of buying a Macbook for graphics then buying another laptop for anything else. So are there laptops out there that meet good graphical requirements? Plenty. How many of them don't look terrible. Few. I play games. Many games. I am a gamer. Gaming laptops look horrible. No two ways around it. The exception being Razer, but I've not the money to pay their laptop tax and wasn't looking for something so powerful. I needed a Quadcore, discreet graphics ( 950m up), room for both an a 2.5\" and M.2 SSD and it has to look good. Then I found it, it was a lovely laptop by Asus. Then Dell came out with this lovely dear. The one difference was 2GB of VRAM and anyone whose spent a little time in Premiere Pro knows that can mean a lot of saved time. So I went with the Dell. She's not the thinnest or lightest, but she fits well in a bag. Her performance is topnotch for her price as a mobile unit and you can play most modern games at a mix of medium high to high settings with 60fps. On the design side she boots up in 4 seconds and all Adobe software are up and ready in 10 seconds or less. The screen is just okay, but LG has a screen for this laptop that is much better with the colour accuracy. So at the end of the day, do you want a beautiful, understated machine with good specs and good power for a great price? You can't go wrong with this laptop. As a side note I forgot to write this review for a while and Dell just announced their 2017 version of this laptop. Same price but with a 1050. More powerful, but ...lets just say it LOOKS like a gaming laptop. So with that in mind I'd buy the last gen version again."}

Got it today, opened it up, spent 5 minutes setting up windows, and BOOM, it was ready to go.  After ten minutes I had to reboot it for updates.  It shutdown and restarted within 30 seconds.  FAST!  I took the hard drive out of my old laptop, and plugged it infor additional storage space.  Also got an additional 8gb ram.  Installing both took all of 5 minutes.  Having the single panel on the bottom is ingenious.  Once I got my games downloaded, I gave it a test run with Battlefield.  Great gameplay.  Graphics were awesome, sound is good.  For the price, I cannot complain about what I got.  I would highly recommend this laptop.  From what I can see, get the larger SSD on the M2 board, and use that as your main drive.

I thought at first it was a great deal, and worth all the time I spent saving money too get it, but now I realize just how WRONG I was. The screen on the first computer I got developed a line of dead pixels the week I got it. I returned it to amazon, and so that was sorted out. The new one though, got a new dead pixel LESS THAN TWO MONTHS LATER. I sent it in for repair, and got it replaced under manufacturers warranty. Now, today I boot up my laptop and what do I see? I see ANOTHER SCREEN PROBLEM ON MY <1 MONTH OLD SCREEN. There are now pixelated lines of green running across the right side of my computer, when all it's done is sit on my desk! And, all this is not even to mention that the 3mm headphone jack recently stopped responding. Overall, I have to say that the terrible build quality of this computer makes it not worth even $500, much less the $800 I spent. Would not buy again, and WILL NOT recommend.\n***Original Review***\nI like this computer. It's a great budget deal, even cheaper now than when I bought, and it runs all of the games I wanted it to. While it isn't top of the line even now, it runs new games very well on medium or high settings. I would definitely recommend updating your drivers right away though, as that makes the computer run better. There was however was rather major problem. The first one that I got worked great for two days, and then I turned it on only to see 3 lines of dead pixels. Of course I returned it, and amazon sent a new one out. This one has been working great, up until a few days ago when I noticed a dead pixel on the new one as well. It is very distracting, especially when I am trying to play darker games like The Forest, or watch a movie or video. Unfortunately I am about a month outside of my return window, so I'm stuck with this for a couple years until I upgrade. I hope that this review helped you make an informed decision!"}

I use it sparingly (On average, 1 hour of gaming and then some light Excel work every day for the 20 some days I've had it) and when it leaves the house with me it is in a padded sleeve and the sleeve is in a shoulder bag.  Last night I was on it for 1.5 hours, and everything was fine.  This morning I turned it on to find an ugly black shadow in the bottom left corner of the screen (see photo.  That's not a lighting shadow.  The contrast is more pronounced in the photo, but it's still bad in person).  This is such a disappointment.  I live out of the country without Dell support, so this is extremely inconvenient.  There were warnings about the screen in other reviews, but I took a gamble.  Do yourself a favor and don't make the same mistake.  The rest of the machine has been impressive for the price point, BUT functionality of a laptop starts with its screen, so this one is garbage.  Do you really want to send this thing away or have to pay for a screen repair (or worse yet, live abroad without any such options)?  Pass.  Read about the cheap build.  I did, and like I said I still gambled.  But knowing what I did I took extra care with the hinges and screens and it still happened.  Why should a $700 purchase be a craps shoots?  Its not worth the nice specs inside for the price if it can't hold itself together for even a month.\n\nOn a side note, I'd appreciate any technical advice.  Thank you and happy shopping elsewhere."}

But, for the price and performance, this laptop could not be any better.  This is my first machine with an SSD and my first machine with a discrete GPU.  The only issue with this computer is that if you are downloading multiple games you will need to add an additional SSD or hard drive. Fortunately this is super easy.  I am technically illiterate and I managed to install an additional 8gb of RAM and an additional SSD.  They make it extremely easy.  One screw and you have access to the RAM and a 2.5 in drive slot.\n\nAlmost everyone says that upgrading to 16gb of RAM is unnecessary and that you won't notice a substantial difference unless you are doing heavy creative work or design or whatever-this is wrong.  I used this machine for about a week with the stock setup and then added the RAM.  I noticed an immediate difference in speed across all applications.  I highly recommend adding RAM as it is a cheap and easy way to upgrade.  Note-I bought this on sale a few weeks ago for $659.99. I still recommend this at the higher price and I wouldnt bet on the price lowering again while this is in stock.  It is really just unheard of to get this much in a laptop for this price.  The GPU is obviously what makes it special. If you've never had a gaming machine before, you will be blown away.  If you are a PC gamer who uses top of the line GPU's, you won't be blown away, but you will understand how much of a great deal this is."}

After my previous gaming tower died in 2010, I played exclusively on consoles for several years.

While it's not going to play modern games on Ultra settings at 4K resolutions, it does a very respectable job. It can handle The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and DOOM on high settings, plays FFXIV with everything maxed flawlessly, makes for a buttery smooth Overwatch and does it all with the added upside of portability and an understated, professional aesthetic. Unlike other gaming laptops with blinding, garish LEDs flashing from every orifice, this is easily mistaken for a simple work laptop.\n\nI've run into no stability or overheating issues. Battery life is decent for web browsing and video streaming (though you'll want to have your adapter with you while you're gaming, of course). Best of all, upgrades are ridiculously simple, with the entire bottom plate easily removable for access to ram and storage.\n\nSimply put, this performs as well as or better than a PS4, is portable, and has access to Steam.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "There once was a time not so long ago I swore never to buy a Dell again, but I've really been wanting a laptop with a descrete graphics and didn't need much more than a GTX 960 to run the games I wanted to play. These would be mostly \"on the go games\" that were starting to run pretty badly on my almost 4 year old laptop. My older laptop had an i7 processor but I didn't expect this one to perform worse considering it has its own graphics card.\n\nSo as for the games that I wanted to run better:\nPath of Exile - Much better on the Dell. I can have the graphics at around medium and don't get significant drops once the game is loaded and going. PoE runs a lot better on an SSD too so the Dell seems to be naturally set for it. Would be nice on a GTX 970M.\nOverwatch - Also much better. Graphics still have to be close to low to get 60FPS and I haven't played it all that much since it requires solid internet, but when my friend wants me to join them I now can.\nCities Skylines - Amazingly better. This one is mostly processor-bottlenecked but the newer i5 seems to do better than my aging i7 on my previous laptop, and the graphics card can only help. My cities aren't big enough to cause problems yet.\n\nThere's also a small list of other games that ran fine on my older laptop, and will obviously run even better on the Dell so I'm not worried about them. So far the upgrade was worth it.\n\nAs for the usability of the laptop, I like pretty much every part of it. The battery life is solid when you aren't gaming (I'm getting close to 4 hours when it's not intensive usage), the keyboard is responsive and so far hasn't missed a tap from what I can tell, and the mouse pad is pretty good when needed. I would still reocmmend a regular mouse over a mouse pad. My previous laptop was a touchscreen and it's taken some getting used to to remember this one isn't, but I don't really miss the touch screen the more I'm without it. The sound gets pretty loud and the speakers aren't total crap, they'll get you through a song and don't distort very much. The keyboard backlighting is great and not too bright, and the generally rubberized feel of the laptop helps with grip and overall feel. This feels like a quality machine.\n\nThen my favorite part is how deadly silent the laptop is when you're just browsing. When gaming the fan will kick on but the laptop still doesn't get very hot, which is probably in part due to the lack of a hard drive and (I'm assuming) better heat dissapation overall. My last laptop wasn't very good sitting on your lap because it got hot really quickly but so far I haven't had to take this one off even when playing something like Path of Exile on a couch (not that that's an extremely demanding game). I have yet to try anything like Fallout 4 or Doom on here but I'm so spoiled with my desktop that I doubt I'll taint my experience by dumbing it down for a 960M.\n\nI also am really glad to be back to 1080p resolution. My last laptop was 3200x1800 which, while sometimes bigger is better, I have absolutely no idea why the company didn't go with 2560x1440 instead. 3200x1800 is a pain to deal with: games hate it, my desktop barely knew what to do with it, and trying to organize windows was just a pain. Fullscreened images and videos, when supported, did look good, but that was about it. But even though I'm happier with 1080p, I wish the screen size was on the smaller side. Something closer to 14 inches would be better to me, but for how light and quit this thing is I'm not going to complain too much.\n\nOverall if you need a surprisingly good laptop with a discrete graphics card, then this is one I can definitely recommend."}

I use the Dell as a video editing machine.\n\nPROCESSING\nAlthough most of my video editing is very simple, my old PC took 50 minutes to process a 6 minute video. This machine can process a 6 minute HD video in under 10 minutes. I am very pleased with this laptop. I have edited videos, watched HD videos online and played games without any trouble.\n\nNOISE & HEAT\nIt's a very quiet laptop and I rarely heard the fan blowing. Heat isn't an issue, the machine doesn't get too warm.\n\nCONSTRUCTION\nThe construction is solid. The external construction consists of high quality plastics and rubber. If you are sensible, you shouldn't worry about breaking it. Keep in mind that it is a little heavy for a 5.6 laptop, but it wasn't a deal breaker for me.\n\nOVERALL\nThis is a solid gaming/video editing for moderate use. You will likely play high end games on graphic settings placed on medium to high. I recommend this laptop for multi-media playback, basic 1080p video editing and moderate gaming. This is one of the best laptops you'll find for under $750."}

This one is a different story. Four months after I bought this machine, I opened the screen one morning to find a crack in the display. There had been nothing to cause this, it just appeared. A couple of days later another crack appeared. And now there are several. All the while this computer has been sitting on my desk. I contacted Dell and told them this story.

There I found several people that had the same thing happen to them. The Dell reps are completely oblivious, they are continuing to say there was abuse. This amounts to calling me dishonest. So I went online to see about getting this fixed any way possible. I found a replacement screen for $105 with an instruction video tools and full support. Dell had quoted me $319 just for the screen. And of course since it was not under warranty, I would have to pay for labor and shipping as well. As you can see, this is a horror story. I could go on about the complete lack of support and how it now constantly hangs up requiring rebooting. But this is enough."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "So, my family member and I both bought gaming laptops. His arrived first and I loved it and didn't want to give it back when he asked for it. Very easy to transition to using it, etc. Then, I got mine. While it has some good features, the touchpad makes it almost unusable because so many of my clicks produce no result and I often get results I didn't want. The left and right clickers are not separate and you have to touch very precisely but not according to clear boundaries. So, it's very hard to know where to click to get the result you want. I sometimes have to click several times to get a result. Because Need a computer that can be used at home with a keyboard and mouse and at other locations such as coffee shops, on my lap in a cab, etc. I can't rely on a separate keyboard and mouse all the time. This is a huge problem. If it were just a matter of getting used to a new setup, that would be okay, I guess. But, having to click several times and guess where to click for left and right clicks because the designated areas are not uniformly sensitive is a deal breaker. I've also had problems with some of the keys suddenly being unresponsive and having to restart the computer to fix the problem. If these issues did not exist, I'd recommend the computer, but they are time wasting and concerning. I literally have to carry a mouse with me to client meetings to use this without distractions, redo's, and embarrrassment as it's difficult to use the trackpad without the screen resizing, tabs opening that I didn't want open etc. The issue is that your placement of your thumb for the left and right click is so particular that you can't simply click in the area where there are separate buttons on other laptops and the area where it seems indicated on this laptop. You literally have to click on a tiny area within those, not an area you an feel or see as defined but just a very particular unmarked area with no clearly defined boundaries. I would never have bought this computer if I'd known that was a possibility. I thought I'd get used to it, but I haven't even though I use this computer all day every day. It's absolutely a waste of time to use this without a separate mouse. The keys not working doesn't happen very often but it's disturbing when it does."}

I've had it a few weeks only so I can't comment yet on long term build quality etc (it does feel a little flimsy and doesn't inspire much confidence).\n\nCons:\n-The keyboard isn't my favorite, feels a little mushy, but I find myself getting used to it so thats OK.\n-The trackpad isn't very good as many have noted, the clicking and texture feel a little strange to me. That said this isn't an ultra portable or something, it's a gaming laptop and I would expect most users to have a mouse 75% off the time or more. As a stop gap for getting some work done having forgot your mouse at home I can live with it at this price point. I wouldn't want to game with a trackpad anyway, even a good one.\n-My biggest gripe, the screen doesn't get very bright. The color looks ok to me, and for productivity tasks the brightness is probably fine, however some games seem just a little too dark for my liking. It feels like my eyes are really straining to make out enemies at long ranges in cs:go, bf1 etc. when compared to my desktop monitor.\n-Compared to most laptops it's big and heavy, but was expected so no biggie.\n\nPros:\n- Plenty powerful with some to spare for all of my productivity aps. Matlab, mathematica and even solidworks seem to run great.\n- Runs CSGO, the only game that really matters to me, at 120+ FPS when settings are reduced.\n- Everything seems to run smooth, no driver issues etc, but I updated everything including bios right away when I received it.\n\nTLDR:\n I travel regularly for work and wanted a laptop that I could use to get work done and play the occasional CSGO pug while traveling. I also wanted something that looked professional enough to take to a conference and use to give a presentation etc. So far this seems to check all those boxes, so I'm happy."}

The connector is thick and heavy and the weight of the cord caused the insulation to split right at the end of the plug. Dell wouldn't replace the cord. I had to Liquid Weld it back together (electrical tape peeled off and got sticky). After another few months, the plastic casing just above the power port split - again, because the darn cord is so thick and heavy. And yup, Dell won't fix it.\n\nAll in all I'm happy with the computer's performance, but I would seriously reconsider buying another Dell unless there was a different type of power cord.

This is an amazing laptop, I've had it for 4 months now and it feels even better than when I first got it. I still need to add the extra RAM for a little more power but it is already powerful as it is. The negative reviews come from the people that received defective ones from the Amazon warehouses. Some are good and some are bad. Who knows how long they've been having the laptop you get in their warehouse. That's why I went with Dell.com because I know that they keep their products updated.

So I purchased the i5 6300HQ version with the extra 8GB RAM. When the laptop arrived, the RAM was in the same box, and I quickly got to work un-packaging and installing. When I removed the back panel, I was happy to find the most descriptive and easily accessible internals I have ever seen. Down to \"Remove the battery cable before touching components\". I installed the new RAM without any issues, and then installed the Samsung 850 Evo SSD I purchased. The SSD fit perfectly into the HD slot without any movement.\n\nI have attached two pictures of CrystalDiskMark tests, one shows the stock M.2 drive, and the other shows the 850 Evo - 500GB. The stock SSD did very well compared to the Evo in the Read tests, but fell behind a little in the Write tests. This is understandable considering the Evo is one of the top SATA SSDs on the market, and probably the best value. Regardless, the stock SSD outperforms most SATA SSDs you will find, especially pre-installed.\n\nThis laptop boots in about 8 seconds. The loading screens flash briefly, I'm impressed.\n\n*One caveat: When you first start up, you will need to change the default graphics setting to the NVidia card if you plan on gaming or video editing. The default setting is 'Auto', which basically means Integrated Intel graphics. Once you change that, you're good to go."}

I first installed without doing simultaneous upgrades but experienced some problems with gnome-software dying when i tried to install deb files when i just installed ubuntu straight up. After I did that I had a few misses with restarts but it is great now. I've actually never used any form of Linux on good hardware, it's fantastic!\n\nFor a developer, the matte screen leaves nothing to be desired.

It's close to desktop performance that you can theoretically bring to a coffee shop. The power block is just enormous and weighs about a pound.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "I'm known among my peers for being able to find the best electronics deals on the market, and after dozens of hours of research, I splurged and bought the Dell Inspiron 7559. My verdict after a couple weeks of use: if you want a laptop that can play all the latest games at medium settings or higher, and you don't wanna spend over $1,000, this is your best option at this point in time. Dell didn't cut corners in this laptop's design - there are no killer flaws or nuisances that detract from the experience, like a keyboard that can't keep up with fast typing, a sub-1080p screen, slow WiFi or a lack of USB 3.0 ports(the 7559 has three USB 3.0 ports, and the one on the right side can charge your devices while the system's in sleep mode). The only flaw I can think of is the relatively high price for a laptop, but it's far cheaper than competing devices with similar hardware; I can't even successfully nitpick about this thing.\n\nThe i5 model comes with a 256GB M.2 SSD, and there's a SATA port for a 2.5-inch hard drive. With the SSD as a boot drive, the laptop boots up in less than ten seconds and general computer usage is snappy and responsive. I installed Overwatch on the SSD and the quick load times spoil me. I've yet to try the Dark Souls games on the SSD, but hopefully I'll remember to update this review and report my findings - on a 7200RPM mechanical drive, Dark Souls 3 takes about a minute to load any time you teleport from one area to another or when you initially load the game. From what I've read, the SSD should cut that to closer to 15 seconds.\n\nThe i7 model comes with a higher-capacity mechanical drive connected to the SATA port, leaving the M.2 port empty. One point for the i5 model. A week after this laptop arrived, I installed a 2TB Seagate FireCuda hybrid drive for all my future game installs; this is the first laptop I've ever owned with two hard drives in it, and the difference in power usage and weight is absolutely negligible. Kudos to Dell for putting such an awesome feature in a mid-range laptop.\n\nOn laptops with a 1080p or higher display, I always play games with the anti-aliasing off. On a 15.6-inch 1080p display, jaggies aren't much of a bother, and I'd rather my system run cooler and the battery last longer than crush a couple jaggies here-and-there.\n\nWith its quad-core i5 and GTX 960M, the 7559 can play Overwatch at ultra settings at around 50-54 FPS, and at high it stays at a rock-solid 70. On the character selection screen the game drops closer to 35FPS, but as soon as you hop into the match, the framerate doubles; clearly more of an optimization issue on Blizzard's part than due to hardware. Civilization: Beyond Earth stayed at 60FPS at around medium settings, and I had the same experience with Starcraft 2: Heart of the Swarm. I tried a few other games like The Forest, Black Mesa and Dirt 3 and they all played like a charm. For some reason, though, when I tried to play the new Doom, the game was just as choppy at lowest possible settings, 720p + 50% render scale as it was between medium and high settings. My drivers are updated and the Nvidia control panel said that the game was set to run on the 960M and not the far-weaker Intel integrated GPU, but I'll troubleshoot some more and update my review if I can get it running in a playable form. Doom is the only game I've thrown at this machine that gave me any trouble, and I'm sure I can get it running like a champ on this beast of a laptop.\n\nIn the future I'll add benchmark results and what kinda gaming performance you can expect, but beyond Doom acting weird, I've had nothing but a positive experience with the Dell Inspiron 7559. I recommend it whole-heartedly.\n\nBonus: This was initially delivered the day before Thanksgiving, while I was at work. Unless the package grew wings, someone stole it from my porch. I was so depressed, I stayed home for Thanksgiving and waited by the door in case the delivery was merely a day late. Luckily, I was able to speak to an Amazon customer service rep and they sent a replacement at no charge to me - two-day shipping. Kudos to Amazon for being the best."}

The top and wrist rest area are a flat rubber finish, both collect finger prints. The keyboard is okay, but a bit shallow. The touchpad is my biggest dislike. There are physical right/left click buttons, however they are under the touchpad area and not separated. This causes issues with right-clicking mostly, as the physical right-click is under an area where you could accidentally left-click, and the area which physically clicks is a little vague and hard to find sometimes.\n\nThe SSD in mine was an M.2 drive, with nothing in the 2.5 inch bay, so if you are a little tech-savvy you could add your own. Removing the back is a matter of a couple screws, where you have access to the 2.5 inch bay, the M.2 slot, as well as the RAM slots.\n\nThe real draw for me is the graphics card. I haven't done any hardcore gaming but it is plenty for the 1-2 year games I've been playing."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "I bought this a few weeks ago, and so far I love it. I got it to play games that were a little more technologically demanding than my previous laptop could handle (right now, mostly Dragon's Dogma and Overwatch), and it's been performing admirably. Games run smoothly and at very attractive visual standards, as one should expect from a 960M. Startup is way faster than my (3ish years old) previous laptop, and the screen is a dramatic improvement - I've seen people complain about it, but besides a slight darkening at extreme angles, it's a very good display.\n\nTo bolster the memory, I added a Firecuda 2tb hybrid drive in the HDD slot, which was a little nerve wracking but overall painless (make sure you get the cover to sit right when you screw it back on, it's a little too forgiving). I cannibalized an old laptop for hard drive screws, so keep that in mind if you plan on adding memory. It's a great drive, I really recommend it, and I can guarantee that it fits (if you grab one, make sure it's the 2.5\" laptop drive, 7mm tall). There are a bunch of guides on how to do it, and how to move relevant files over (and how to make the new drive the \"default\" drive).\n\nThe only real problem is the GPU generates a lot of heat, so when I play games, the fans run pretty high. Keeps the laptop within acceptable temperature ranges though, so it's worth it. Standard use generates zero noise. I guess another problem is the chassis's tendency to accumulate smudges. It's a slick look, and feels good, but if you're a neat freak it might irritate. The touchpad doesn't have detached buttons either, so you mostly get around by tapping the pad, but I've already gotten used to it. Make sure you disable the setting that delays touchpad input for a second or so after touching keys - it's meant to keep your hand from accidentally hitting the pad while you type, but really it just makes the pad feel unresponsive. And while I'm dispensing advice, update all the drivers and the OS ASAP. Basically prepare for an hour of just updating your laptop after it's out of the box. This process is bog standard for laptops, but improved measurably by the fact that restarting this particular device only takes around 14 seconds.\n\nThe Obligatory List:\n\nPros\nGreat performance for the money (will play basically any game not released in late 2016, at medium to high standards)\nGood display\nStylish (YMMV)\nMinimal bloatware (I killed Mcafee and installed AVG, personally)\nFull keyboard (dunno if anyone cares about this but me)\nEasy upgrade (comparatively)\nSDD makes for rapid startup\n\nCons\nAudible fans under high load\nSurfaces require high maintenance\nNot a great touchpad (though far from unusable)\n\nComplaints I read about but have not experienced\nBroken touchpad\nLow feedback keyboard (it's fine)\nDark screen (it's not)\nBad audio (about as good as you can expect from a laptop, gets pretty loud)\nConstant fans\nCatastrophic hard/software failure (I did have an issue with an NVIDIA driver update, but it was an easy fix)\n\nFinal score: Not perfect, but a seriously good buy and more than capable of fulfilling most user needs with grace."}

Though additional SSD much larger than 250GB not \"supported by dell for this product\" because of power usage, I've had no problem with using a second 500GB Samsung 850evo (that manufacturer has the best efficiency that I've seen at an affordable price. This inspiron came with bracket and connector for 2.5\" SATA III (need to buy the screws though -- type: M3x 0.5P THD (Depth 3.5mm Minimum); these were not super easy to find, but they are out there -- looking back at my history I think this is the website I used [...]-- not sure if that link will remain unblocked, couldn't find them on AMZN.)\n\nAdded 8GB more RAM, easy installation -- Cannot install more than 16GB of DDR3 RAM total (so 8gb in each slot, comes with one).\n\nThe monitor brightness is easy to adjust, with a good range, ranging from very bright to fairly dim (I actually like to use really dim screen for its power-saving effect, and there's filter apps available with a quick search...didn't check to see if android apps work, I just assumed not.)  The monitor is a decent size, though not 4k, and perhaps feels a little flimsy if you're used to being able to move your laptop around by its screen.\n\nThe battery isn't the longest lasting, but I saw that coming, and settings can be adjusted to conserve power.  Practically, it runs about 4 hours on battery.\n\nThe one I bought came with Windows 10 pre-installed.  I suspect you couldn't get it any other way.  Many people hate Windows 10, but it seems mostly fine to me, with the exception of Cortana being pretty much impossible to remove (as of the last time I looked.)  Apparently one \"fix\" worked, (but MS has since removed that possibility) and the difficulty of making any browser other than Edge (the updated IE) the default browser.\n\nCan play a fairly recent games like Fallout 4 with no problem on medium settings.  Honestly, I haven't really tried them on higher settings.  Maybe I will do so and edit this review.  I also didn't actually test the FPS.  Maybe I will do so.  ONE BIG DRAWBACK is the Graphics card cannot be upgraded.  It is integrated with the CPU.  Upside: the hybrid graphics card (both NVIDIA and INTEL) works seemlessly and one can adjust which program uses which card.\n\nOne thing that is really annoying is the space bar on the keyboard.  I'm still adjusting to it.  It seems to be too easy to double-press it, because I often see spaces too big between words, though I was able to type this whole segment without double-spacing, paying particular attention to my typing style.  I used to be a very good typist, so I'm not sure if it's just a matter of being out of practice.  I honestly have not had the problem on any other keyboard ever, so I suspect its this computer (and maybe its specific to just my laptop.)\n\nI wish I had a good video editor so that I could inform you how well it performs rendering.  Perhaps Christmas will be good to me.  I will try to edit this review, if such a function exists, when I do have a chance to test this.\n\nSo, the limitations on upgradability is the major drawback of this laptop, otherwise it functions right now very well."}

I'm actually a more of a Macintosh person, having used them since around 1985, but I'm also comfortable with Windows. When it came time to get a laptop, I wanted something as a secondary computer that I only used occasionally, so I didn't want to spend what it would cost to get an adequate Macbook. But it also had to have the muscle to power through raw files from my Canon 5DSr, which can challenge more lightweight computers. And I wanted it to have at least full HD screen resolution to deal with the 50 megapixel images.\n\nThis fit the bill. The price is right, and it has no trouble whatsoever with performance.

Within ten months, the hinge holding the screen to the chassis began splitting apart. The computer had not been dropped or mistreated in any way, and a cursory internet search found that many people have had the same problem, and of course, Dell deemed it out-of-warranty damage over the phone before their technicians even examined it.\n  This is clearly poor manufacturing quality control; there was no physical damage done to the computer; no denting, scratches or scuffing that would indicate it had been dropped. In fact the unit had rarely been taken out of the house. Follow up with Dell conflict resolution was completely unhelpful. Their solution ?  \"Buy an extended warranty next time you buy Dell.\"  Well, there won't one a next time with Dell.  I am a committed Apple user and only bought my daughter a pc at her request. Clearly it was a waste of money; as not only did the unit physically fall apart, leaving tiny screws all across the house, but it also has a series of operating issues as well that required repair, including problems finding wireless networks and screen flickering that made the computer unusable.\n  Very poor experience and Dell was unresponsive to the problems."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "Let me start out by saying that the reason this isn't a one star review is that the majority of the hardware is good. The RAM is expandable, there's an extra drive slot, sound is good, and the overall form factor is nice. I'm not a huge fan of the mouse (there's no good way to middle click), but that's excusable.\n\nWhat's not excusable is the screen. For the first few months, it was fine. Then it started flickering. So I called support and went through a couple hours of turn it off and on again, let them access your system remotely, update the drivers, and finally acknowledge that there was a problem. Then it was off for a week and a half to the depot. And it came back without the problem fixed. So I sent it back again, this time for three weeks because they didn't have a replacement screen on hand. And finally, the black flickers were gone! Well, if gone is a codeword for replaced with a new kind of flicker. And I'm to the point where I don't want to have to deal with sending it back to the manufacturer to maybe get the issue resolved, but probably just lose access to it for a couple weeks.\n\nSo if you  plan on buying this, hooking it up to an HDMI port, and then forgetting about the screen, you won't be disappointed. Otherwise, you're spinning a roulette wheel when it comes to one of the most important parts of the system."}

Perfect for the person who is on the go or lacks the money, knowledge or will to build their own gaming PC. While it has several newer models it still holds its own.  I can run Mass Effect Andromeda on full medium settings with no lagging or bad frame rates (assuming 40-60 frames is acceptable.) The fan is not the quietest but it is manageable. It has really good speakers for a laptop, you will hear it.\n\nMy concerns with this laptop are as follows; if you want to stream to Twitch Youtube or another streaming service, this is not the laptop for you. It doesn't have the graphics power to stream without either causing severe game lag or out of sync audio in your stream. It can record fairly well, just not stream. Fragile casing, I haven't dropped or banged my laptop but I suspect it wouldn't take much effort to break the plastic casing and damage the internal components.\n\nAt the current pace of video game graphics, I would not consider this computer \"future proof\" at least not for more than another year.\nOh and if you want hardware protection, buy the SquareTrade at checkout, it is MUCH cheaper than Dell's customer support."}

All of these were completed fantastically by this laptop, especially the gaming bit. It far exceeded my expectations.\n\nPros:\n-Keyboard feels tactile and has good back lighting\n-Sounds fantastic for a laptop, a bit tinny but that's to be expected\n-Screen looks great, colors pop and the matte finish is much better than gloss. I only wish it would get a little brighter when plugged in and turned all the way up\n-Boot times were under 10 seconds most of the time on the SSD\n-Expandable for another hard drive and RAM stick\n-Finish on the laptop feels soft to the touch and nice to hold\n-Automatically switches to integrated graphics on battery to lower power consumption (can be changed in settings)\n-Runs games at over 100 FPS at medium settings most of the time (what more can you expect for a laptop the price of some video cards)\n\nCons:\n-The mouse pad could definitely be improved. The pre-installed drivers were horrendous so I got some Elantech drivers instead and its better, however still not as good as it should be. Love the multi-touch and the grainy feel though\n-Gets a bit hotter than i'd like, but this isn't a big deal as it stays under 80 at all times, and considering the price range its understandable\n\nWould 100% recommend this laptop for anywhere between the 800 and 1000 price range. I added an extra ram stick and hard drive so it drove the price up about another $100, but it was worth the extra space since the SSD is so small."}

I upgraded from a 6 years old PC so that could be the reason, but it is a joy to do thing you do every day with x2 speed, it boots instantly, downloads and games are definitely much faster. I tried Syrim on ultra and indoors it was 60fps solid whereas when you go out in a foggy day well around 20ish. On the other hand, I also play FF XIV no slowdowns, no fps drops, quite a smooth experience throughout. Even when I played demanding games for hours end it did not over heat, the fans are doing a great job but I live in Wisconsin so it is not really hot here. I think for summer some laptop fans are in order. I must add while not gaming it is extremely silent and handles surfing to light editing perfectly. I did not have wireless issues like others... yet.\n\nCons; the screen, the material that the laptop is built, the keyboard and the trackpad etc. everything is cheap and feels cheap. You can really see that Dell had to cut some corners here to reduce the overall price. I know it is not retina display, but some better screen would have been great considering you buy this for gaming i.e. to look at some eye candy.\n\nOverall; you get what you pay for, if you upgrade it with rams and a second hdd, it really rivals other overpriced gaming laptops."}

For $750.00 you are getting a nice looking machine that has some impressive internals that are easy to upgrade.\nI went with the Core i5, 256GB SSD model with the 8GB of Kingston RAM bundle. Immediately threw in a 275GB Crucial MX300 SSD for storage, and an Intel 7265 Wifi card. So the whole deal ran me about $850.00 + tax.\nFor that you get a damn nice computer that is by no means top of the line, but just rock solid. The non-gaming battery life is very good (I got almost 6 hours yesterday unplugged - loading up the machine with Stream and other games and other software while web browsing). I tested out an older game yesterday (Wargame: European Escalation) and the performance was awesome - no lag or stutters at maxed out settings. The screen is very good - crisp and clear with colors good enough for my eyes. Minor light-bleed at the bottom of the screen. One thing here tho, those fans kick in when gaming and they are not silent. Also, IMHO, the small sub does make the sound more \"full,\" and the speakers are pretty good, IMHO. But I'll be using headphones, so who really cares.\nDell has really cut back on the bloatware. Mcafee was the main culprit, and I got rid of it immediately. Other than that, just Dell's diagnostic stuff - which I kept for now until I get sick of it and wipe the machine for a fresh install.\nA few negatives: I broke off 2 small plastic securing pieces when opening the base-plate to get inside. I found a site online that sells a replacement for about $15.00, and will get one. In the meantime 2 small strips of clear packing tape and it is solid. Bottom line here is don't take a knife and pop the back up. You kinda have to bend it in from the bottom and then pop it up. Search online for a video explanation.\nSecond is the screen is great, but max brightness is a little dim compared to other machines. But the screen is matte, so there is little glare. It kinda balances out, but I do wish it was brighter.\nAnother negative is I got the bundle with the extra 8GB of RAM. Unfortunately, the RAM in the machine for me was not Kingston, but Hyundi. But the RAM looks identical, so it should be OK. The other thing with the RAM is it shows 15.9 GB available of 16GB. Never seen that before. Researched and no big deal apparently. Have not tested to see if it is one stick or the other or a system thing.\nSoooooooo bottom line: Good machine, not perfect, but well worth the money you will pay for it, IMHO. Fast, pretty clean software, easily upgradeable, nice screen, speakers and keyboard (I don't use a trackpad - can't tell you whether it sucks or not), but at the same time with a construction you would expect from a budget machine."}

This doesn't happen very often, but its worry-some when it does happen because it sounds like it's about to crash the whole computer.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "I got this laptop as I needed something to take to college, and I also wanted to be able to play some games.  I'm very happy to say that it has worked great for me so far!\n\n  The physical side of this laptop is great.  It is sleek and somewhat lightweight.  Now it's no macbook or chromebook or whatever in terms of size and weight, but I have no problem carrying it around in my bag all day.  It's also durable.  I was a little worried because I saw some reviews of the body breaking, but I've slung it around in my backpack for a couple of months and I've had no problems.  The material feels good but it is VERY easy to leave smudges on the top and it looks dirty..  I like that it has the red accents that make it look pretty cool, but at the same time it doesn't look like one of those ridiculous \"pro gamer\" laptops that look like they came off of an alien spaceship.  It has some heat fin things that do a great job of keeping it cool, but they also aren't too flashy.  I'm not embarrassed at all to pull it out at school or in public because it doesn't have flashing lights and crap like that.  The keyboard and trackpad work well, however you will not be playing games with the trackpad.  You will definitely need a mouse for that, but it works great for browsing the web. The keyboard is backlit white with three options: bright, dim, and off.  I keep it off because I don't like it.  The screen is good however when it is showing black you can see some light bleeding around the edges.  Not really a problem in my opinion but some people might care if they are doing color sensitive work or something like that.  On the bottom of the laptop there is a panel held on by one screw which gives access to the ram and ssd and also an extra slot for a second hard drive or ssd.  It took me about 5 minutes to take the panel off, install a second hard drive, and put the panel back on.  The ram is also easily accessible but I don't think upgrading the ram would accomplish much for gaming or general usage.  3 usb slots, sd card slot, ethernet port, headphone jack, power cable port, hdmi slot is all good.  I think that the speakers are good but the subwoofer on the bottom is a joke.  It might as well not even be there.  I would have preferred it not be there and save like 20 bucks off the cost of the computer.  Definitely a waste of space, weight, and money. This is my biggest complaint.\n\n  Now for the important stuff.  The battery is good.  I take it to school and do a couple of hours work and never have to worry about it.  It would probably last about 7-8 hours for light use.  You will have to plug it up while gaming though or it will only last a couple of hours or less. The ssd is fast and it boots up in about 30-40 seconds.  I actually like windows 10 a lot.  I installed skyrim on the ssd and load times are short, with the longest being the initial loadup which take about 25 seconds at most.  The cpu is great for all uses.  I'm not going to pretend to be all that tech savy but I don't believe the cpu will hold you back when gaming.  8 gigs of ram is plenty for anything the average person would need, and that's why I don't think upgrading it is necessary, but it is great to have the easy option.  Now for the best part: the graphics!!  The 960m graphics are very satisfying and I was surprised at how well it handles games.  I play skyrim on ultra and battlefied 4 on high with great framerates.  Any game before 2016 will work perfectly.  Games from 2016 onwards will start to need to be lowered to at least medium setting unfortunately.  I played the battlefield 1 beta on medium setting and got 45 fps.  Now some people might have a problem with that but I think it's great.  On low setting it was 60+.  High settings I didn't try but I would imagine 30 fps is what you would get.  The frame rate is very stable though.  The laptop also stays surprisingly cool throughout this.  I haven't tested the temperatures, but it does not get too hot to the touch.  If you want to play modern games on a laptop I think that this will do it awesomely.  You won't be maxing stuff out, but it does look great and you will get good fps.  Be warned though- once you get a taste of the glorious pc gaming you will only crave more and more!!!!\n\nPros- great gaming performance, upgradeable ram and storage, fast ssd and cpu,  good build quality, good fullsize keyboard, good ports(usb and hdmi, etc), good battery, looks great- cool and professional,\n\nNeurtral- decent trackpad, decent screen, backlight on keyboard, speakers (except subwoofer that's terrible),\n\nCons- Material smudges and gets dirty easily, subwoofer is just a waste and is terrible.  Like I would just like to say the sub is so bad it kind of makes me wonder why it is even there!  You cant hear it at all, it doesn't vibrate or anything!, limited storage space so you will definitely need to add another hard drive."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "Bought this laptop earlier this year (February or so I believe). It worked great for a while and I didn't have many issues. I used it to play Overwatch, League of Legends, as well as do video editing, audio editing, and photo editing using Premiere Pro, Photoshop, Lightroom, and Audition. I never had any real issues software-wise.\n\nThere is one very big con though that is forcing me to get a new laptop within 10 months of buying this one. The case cannot hold up the weight of this laptop. Back in July, I sat down in a chair while holding the laptop open on the right side with one hand. As soon as I sat down, the weight of the laptop and the lack of support on the left side caused the grating near the fan and the left screen hinge to crack and the case to permanently sit open exposing internals and the left hinge.  I made zero contact with anything, it didn't bump anything. All I did was sit down normally. Replacement parts for this model are incredibly difficult to find (I was unable to find any). As a result, the gap has only gotten wider, causing my mouse to have issues it wasn't having before. The left side of my keyboard from the edge of the case to the F3 key is permanently slanted upward and every time I open the laptop, I have to press down on the exposed part to keep it from getting worse. Unfortunately, for regular use, it's gotten worse. I actually can rarely get the trackpad to register an actual press. Only tapping the pad works regularly now. I can't tape the case closed because if I tape it, the fan vents are covered or the charger port is covered. This issue has convinced me never to get a plastic-cased laptop again. I've attached three photos: one of how I was holding it when the incident happened and two of the split casing.\n\nIt's a great laptop, but be very aware you are getting a plastic laptop casing and amazing for the price. I fully understand that sacrifices have to be made to keep great specs at a low cost. This is reality and I am not holding Dell at fault. The laptop is heavy, so the plastic, over time, may have the same outcome for someone else as it did for me. Had I realized sooner to make sure I was balancing it more intentionally when transporting it, this might not have happened, so I am warning everyone else!"}

At first, we experienced what many reviewers experienced with  the laptop going to a black screen.  My son has autism, so sending it back really wasn't an answer I wanted to deal with because it would've been a long period of meltdowns.  I made sure all of the drivers were updated and then finally ordered a laptop cooling fan from Amazon (Tree New Bee Cooling Pad for 15.6 - 17-Inch Laptops with Four 120mm Fans at 1200 RPM)  As soon as we plugged it in, the screen went black once again.  So we figured out that it must be an overheating or overpowered problem (excuse my non-technical terms.)  I plugged the laptop cooling fan into a USB outlet (instead of the laptop powering it), changed the laptop settings to go into sleep mode after a period of time (my son would never just close it when he was finished) and I can HAPPILY say that we have not had the blackout screen since (a couple of months)\n\nSo, if you want a cheap but well performing laptop, this will work.

The laptop has been great so far for what it is, a mid-level machine.  There are however some downsides to it.\n\nThe material on the outside has the rubbery feel associated with many device covers, which is nice but typically starts to look bad over time.\n\nThe screen is clear and the colors and viewing angles are nice, however the panel brightness leaves something to be desired.\n\nThe keyboard is okay, not great, but okay.  The touch pad is well its a touch pad.  Its not going to compare to macbook pro and it tends to require a bit more force than I like to get it to function properly, however it does work for tasks that do not require accuracy.  If you're going to be gaming though you're not going to be using a track pad so its forgivable to a point.\n\nAudio is okay.  I am somewhat spoiled with my MSI in that department but the audio on the Dell is not bad.  It could use some tweaking in order to sound better, however Ill leave that up to her.\n\nVentilation is great, the bottom of the machine is very well vented and the two small fans inside do a wonderful job keeping the machine cool and quiet under mid-level load.  More demanding tasks will cause the fans to kick on high and the machine to get warm, however the overall noise is still low when compared to my MSI GT70.  I would recommend a cooling pad to provide increased air flow when under heavy load.  When using my pad, we notice a huge decrease in heat and fan noise under load.\n\nPerformance is where this machine shines.  For the price this machine does a wonderful job as a mid-range gaming machine.  My wife has yet to try anything too intensive, however her most played games of Starcraft II and Diablo III run excellent and without problem.\n\nPros\n\n- Great performance for the money\n- Cooling is efficient\n- Display is nice\n- Overall appearance is good.\n- Audio is okay\n\nCons\n\n- Trackpad is awful\n- Keyboard is okay, could be a lot better\n- Case material could be problem over time"}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "I already own a powerful gaming desktop computer, and I bought this one as a work computer and occasional gaming machine for when I'm on the road or at a friend's place. For that function, it has served me very well and at a very reasonable price point. When considering buying this machine, think about what you want to get out of it.\n\nIf you want a gaming laptop, this is probably the best one for the price. It handles most games fairly well, you will probably only have to turn the settings down on the most triple-A graphic intensive titles. Even then, it will run fine on medium-high settings. If you want to add more RAM or storage, it is easy to remove the back panel and install new parts. I also do coding and data analysis on this laptop, and it handles data processing with minimal slowdown. It lacks all the pretentious frills, LEDs, and weird bits you often see on gaming laptops, having a simple black case with red trim. It runs super quiet with the built in SSD, has a nice, big, clear screen, backlit keyboard, and decently functional touch pad.\n\nIf you're looking for a primary high-powered-crush-everything gaming machine, this is not it. It is a mid-range, handle-most-things-just-fine laptop. Then again, if you want a top end gaming computer, you are far better off building a custom desktop PC than buying a laptop. High end laptops will cost you more than twice what a desktop of comparable power and quality will. Don't buy prebuilt desktops, either. They are never a good deal. Buy your own parts and assemble it yourself, you will save lots of money and get exactly the level of power and performance you need.\n\nIf you're looking for a work computer, this will handle just about everything but the most intensive graphics design. For everyday things like word processing and browsing the internet, this laptop is overkill. For someone like me, who does data analysis, algorithm building, some Overwatch on the side, and likes to have ten thousand browser windows open at the same time in Chrome, this laptop does very well.\n\nI recommend avoiding any of the optional upgrades. That i7 processor looks shiny and fancy, but it will not give you much benefit over the i5 processor for gaming. It will only really benefit you if you are an industry professional who needs the extra power for graphic design or other such activities. As for the extra RAM and storage space, you can easily find aftermarket parts for less than is offered here and install them yourself in about 5-10 minutes. The RAM uses the DDR3L slot and the hard drive slot uses 2.5\" drives. The backplate is held on by clips and only one screw, so it is easy to remove and add new parts.\n\nOverall, a reliable machine for a good price. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a backup gaming computer or work computer with a little more oomph than needed for just typing.\n\nEdit: After a year, I have to downgrade my review. The hinge on the laptop separated from the body, and threatened to damage internal components. After some research, this is an extremely common problem, but Dell refused to fix it, even though the laptop was still under warranty. I hesitate to recommend this laptop due to this shoddy construction."}

It's less than half the price of some of the top end machines I looked at and is still a huge improvement over the gaming desktop rig he's replacing.  With the SSD, it boots up very quickly and performance is excellent overall. I was pleasantly surprised at how nice the case was.  For what it's worth, this is a really slick-looking machine compared to most office laptops.  I really want one for myself.  The dual fans are quiet and work great to keep this machine running cooler than some less powerful machines I've used.  That's more important than some people realize if you want the laptop to last along time without problems.\n\nI'm afraid I can't comment on gaming performance at the moment.  My son would know more about that.  I'll update this review if I get any feedback from him one way or the other.\n\nI do have to mention that he began having issues less than 3 weeks after we received the laptop.  It wouldn't boot up or would freeze up while he was using it.  Fortunately, the built-in diagnostics helped me quickly narrow down the problem to the memory in Bank 0.  Dell used a \"SKhynix\" brand memory that I've never heard of before.  I had bought an extra 8GB of Kingston memory when I purchased the laptop, so I just pulled the bad memory and swapped it in.  The machine has worked perfectly since then.  I came really close to dropping my score to a 4 because of it, but despite that problem I'm still really happy with the machine and I think the price was good.  What really made the difference, though, was outstanding Amazon customer service.  I was afraid I'd have to hassle with sending the machine in for service so they could check the memory themselves.  Instead, Amazon just credited my account for the cost of the extra Kingston memory I had bought and it was a done deal.  I don't think I would have had the same experience if I had bought directly from Dell or a big box electronics store."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "This is a great deal for the price, but those who are less than tech savvy may have some difficulties.\n\nThe first thing you need to do when you get this laptop is update the drivers. I suggest going through the individual companies instead of Dell's driver hub. The wireless card is fine, but without the proper driver you will experience frequent disconnect/reconnect that can be incredibly annoying.\n\nMy laptop came with a 256gb M.2 Solid State Drive. That leaves a bay open for another 2.5\" SSD or HD. I got a cheap 1TB HD for my shows and movies. The SSD is reserved for my games.\n\nThis model also comes with an open spot to stick another RAM card in it. Make sure you get DDR3L, I put another 8GB stick in there because I'm a huge multitasker and I always have 10-15 chrome pages open even when I'm gaming,\n\nAdding both the extra HD and RAM was very simple. Literally anyone could figure it out.\n\nNow, performance is acceptable. I knew I wouldn't be getting the best of the best as far as gaming quality, but I still wanted a machine that I could play on. I am a hardcore gamer and I can easily play for 5+ hours without noticing the time pass. I wanted a laptop for on-the-go gaming. Sometimes I'll go to Denny's by myself and game while having some breakfast. I can play Black Ops 3, Fallout 4, Skyrim, and many other games without stutter. Ironically Starcraft 2 is the only game that lags on me, but I think that may be more caused by bad internet connections, not my laptop. Most games I get med/high graphics with at least 30fps. Putting a game on low will always get me a steady 60FPS experience. You're at least getting console quality gaming with this product. The gtx 960m isn't bad. You will have decent gaming laptop here. For under 900 bones(upgrades included) it's a deal you can't beat\n\nThe battery is a beast! I also use this laptop for work. One day I forgot my charger at home and I was able to go all day and even game during my lunch break. I usually spend 4-6 hours a day on my laptop at work. This guy hasn't died on me yet and I have definitely put it to the test. (hint- set your display to high contrast, you will save hours of battery life and save yourself lots of eye damage)\n\nEvery \"professional\" reviewer on youtube slammed the screen quality, keyboard, and the touchpad. The screen color is acceptable and the resolution is 1920x1080 -golden standard unless you want 4k, The keyboard is quiet and illuminated. The touchpad works perfectly for me. I can barely tap it and it registers the click.\n\nThis really is a great deal. I only have a couple critiques: The plastic attracts fingerprints. No USB type C conection.\n\nYou won't find a better laptop for the price. This is a wonderful deal and I look forward to keeping this laptop for at least 3 years before I will need an upgrade."}

It is blazing fast, runs games really well, is sold for cheap, has a fully removable bottom with removable RAM, M.2 SSD, 2.5inch HDD, WLAN card and battery, and has full fan access, and I can't think of a single negative for this Laptop. Well I would prefer if the charge cable slot was on the right side of the laptop (not the left) and there were more USB slots, but I can live with all that stuff. At a price point like this one, I expected SO MUCH less than what I got.\n\nPros:\n-Costs only $779.99\n-Blazing Fast\n-Nice looking screen with good viewing angles\n-2 Fans for great cooling. You won't ever burn your hand as you play video games\n-Ethernet compatibility. I have seen many laptops dropping this for some reason, but luckily this one has it :)\n-Good volume with sub woofer on the bottom of laptop\n-Back-lit keyboard\n-Removable back which leads to removable battery, HDD, m. 2 ssd, WLAN card, and RAM. You can also clean out your fans easily :D\n-For a gaming laptop, this laptop looks pretty damn sweet. It doesn't have that stupid \"gamer\" look to it. (yes I am looking at you Alienware. Please stop making stupid looking laptops we aren't going to buy them)\n-Wait why haven't you bought this yet? The pros outweigh the cons so much. Buy it already\n\nCons: (mostly only minor complaints that anyone (especially gamers) can live with\n-No noise cancellation microphones\n-Charge cable slot on left side of laptop (I would rather have it on right side)\n-Only 3 USB ports\n\nTLDR: Buy this now what are you waiting for?"}

Now that I've had a chance to try it I can say that this laptop as certainly met all of my expectations. It runs games very smoothly compared to many of the laptops in this price range. Also the design is quite nice. I have no problem with the limited amount of memory because I am not a person that requires too much memory as of the moment and once I do all I have to do is expand the memory since this laptop has a free slot. It boots up in seconds and loads fast. Whenever I am in a rush (as a college student) this laptop has saved me from so many time constraints. The battery life is fair(nothing over the top). Overall, I would recommend this laptop for anyone looking for a balance between regular use and gaming; it has a great value."}

After that, the poor construction shows.\n\nSo, don't trust the reviews of ecstatic buyers that just unwrapped their computer. There's a lot more to a computer than a few flashy features.\n\nBought it three months ago and has been sitting on a desk, being used lightly. I close the laptop and then open it, and the display has a crack (underneath the glass). Of course, Dell warranty does not cover this. The screen will cost $280 to fix. So much for a cheap gaming computer.\n\nDell customer service is a nightmare. They told me the part needed was in stock. Now they tell me they don't know when they'll get\nit. They don't even have an estimate for the part to arrive. However, I was already charged the $280 for the repair. Technical service is overseas and employees don't seem to care one way or the other...\n\nEssentially, my computer has been shipped half way around the world. Now  as part of 'customer loyalty program' they are willing to\noffer me a REFURBISHED computer... Of course, they keep the $280.\n\n--> UPDATE: After hours on the phone, being bounced from one department to another, Dell has agreed to exchange my 3-month old computer for a similar refurbished one (the specs are a bit better than mine, but I don't know whose troubles I'm taking on now). However,\nthey shipped to the wrong address and I'm still waiting for a solution. They send you these emails telling you to call them at a standard 1-800 number and when you call, you should expect at least 20-30 minutes of being bounced around departments. Half of the time you are disconnected and have to start all over again.\n\nSo, three months after buying this computer, I end up  (hopefully) with an $1100 refurbished computer (Dell is keeping the $280 for a repair they never did) ... I have 2 $400 Asus that I bought 4 years ago for my kids. They're badly banged up but they still work fine... The screens haven't lost a single pixel, and I had to duct tape the cover on one of those laptops!!\n\nUPDATE: The screen segment has come off the hinges!! I've been using computers for 20 years and never had any problems... The refurbished laptop is junk! Tech support is still Kafkian... they pass you from department to department like a hot potato!!"}

I paid $800 +tax on Amazon.\n\nPROS\nThe laptop has run well with only a couple of stutters.  Opening programs is fast and snappy. The screen is nice a bright, although I don't use it outside so I can't judge there.  The 15.6 inches is a plus for me since I often have a text editor and another web page open while programming. The sound is okay.  It's not the best, but it gets the job done.  I've only played Portal 2, Fallout 4 and Life is Strange on this device.  All run well, but the 7559 can definitely play more graphic intensive games. Just look it up on YouTube.\n\nCONS\nThis laptop is heavy. As a college student I've got to move around a lot so carrying this isn't fun. However, this was never advertise as ultra-portable.  Just keep in mind that if you want to use this in college you'll most likely be carrying other things and this by itself is about 5lb. Secondly, the light from the charger is INCREDIBLY bright, especially in my small dorm room when the lights are off.  The track pad isn't the most responsive when using multi-finger gesture, but I use a mouse often so it doesn't bother me too much.\n\nConclusion\nIf your on a budget and want to game on a portable machine, get it.  It works great, looks good, and it's budget friendly.  My only suggestion would be to buy another source of storage.  You only have about 146GB to use out of the box. I'm using a 2TB My Passport Ultra.  Gaming off of this has also been a pleasant experience, if that's a concern."}

Particularly on websites with a heavy load of content. The backlit keyboard is sharp, and not only did they fit an entire quick-hand key pad on there but the keys are still nicely spaced apart. The built in subwoofer makes the audio seem exceptionally more powerful, as it should. Overall it's just a sharp, amazing computer. It's also the first SSD hard drive I've ever owned and it just adds to the epic speed of the computer. The only thing I could possibly complain about it is when I first booted it up I had minor problems updating and installing drivers/updates. Since then however, it's been perfect.

Great computer, great price, and definitely would recommend to any casual (or serious) gamer who needs a practical everyday laptop."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "Overall this laptop is fine except for the plastic frame and keyboard being way worse than any other laptop I've used.  A key became loose simply because I had a game where I pressed it too much, no exceptional force applied.  I've replaced keys in other keyboards and this has the most tiny, hard to manipulate plastic hinges of all of them.  For other keyboards, either peeling off the key from the top or bottom is easy.  For this neither is, and if you risk it there's a very good chance you'll break the drips of plastic that hold the key to the hinge.\n\nto avoid damage to the power cord, i taped the end up so it wouldn't bend.  After that, just by lifting my laptop up and down in normal use, the laptop was literally pried apart at the corner, had to get it repaired.  The taped power cord was more stable than the chasis.  Now, I don't necessarily blame this on Dell, but it does speak to the build quality. In addition, simply inspecting the sides of the laptop and applying a little pressure with my FINGERNAILS (which should never harm a laptop) a bit of border plastic popped off and despite having connectors to snap back on, it would not.\n\nDell obviously cut corners or skimped when it came to this laptop's body to cut costs and have a more attractive sticker price.  I could rate it perhaps a 2 because it's good performance, but with all the laptops on the market, one that is so fragile that it may as well have been put together for a school project, with a keyboard that can be ruined just by pressing a key many times for a game, is not worth going for."}

I was worried that I would not be able to run the games I love to play such as ESO, and WoW on this computer because of the 960M graphics card. The processor is paired well with this computer (i5 quad). The games work great even on high settings. I recommend this computer to anyone looking to stay under 1,000 dollars and wants a great gaming experience. I do recommend buying the Kingston 8gb of Ram to go with it for 35 bucks! great deal!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "Great product for an unbeatable price. Needed a laptop for the last class in my degree plan, but also realized I could kill two birds with one stone by getting a gaming laptop as I have built myself a dual monitor i7, 960 based dektop that I've used for everything until I needed this. Traditionally I have not been a fan of gaming laptops as they're usually well overpriced for features that I don't find important like RGB lights and \"premium\" audio. And that's what I love about the 7559, it doesn't try to be something it's not. It's an appropriately priced budget oriented gaming laptop that prioritized the hardware and price point they wanted to achieve. An i5, 960m, and 256GB SSD are one hell of a steal for I think I paid 779..? Seeing as how they retail for 800 and come equipped with a 1TB HDD (eww). If you're a broke college kid like me, and can be a (smart) level headed shopper, forget about a steel series keyboard,  RoG features, or red accent OMEN lights, there is absolutely nothing wrong with this laptop. GRANTED, I do play mostly CSGO which is not at all a demanding game, and the class I needed it for had me install MS DOS in a virtual machine.. so the hardware this machine is equipped with was never in question. I realize there will be people who NEED something more because they'll work with some kind of 3D rendering and to them I know this machine will not be enough. But for anyone on a degree plan like me who is just doing something like software development and even plays modern AAA games (which this machine CAN handle) I implore you not to overlook a great product for an absolute steal. You WILL compromise some things, but I don't think you'll lose anything absolutely essential."}

I also noticed that battery life is 3+ hours on high performance, while watching Youtube, browsing the internet and downloading on the nice IPS 1080p display.. Thats amazing. The backplate is very easy to take off, and the laptop is very simple to upgrade. RAM, SATA BAY, and M.2 is very accessible. After gaming 2 hours or so on it playing Dark Souls 3, temps seem to get around 70C on both CPU and GPU. Very solid, cooling is very good.\n\nonly thing is the track pad is harder to get used too. and the keyboard is a bit mushy compared to my old laptop (couldnt even run games but keyboard was best laptop keyboard ever for some reason lol.)\n\nAll in all 5 star rating and 9/10 for this laptop."}

Here is what I just went through over the course of about a month. My computer started freezing on start up, it has not been a year so I knew Dell's warranty was still in tact but I did not know if it was something i did which would void it, like a virus. So i take this computer to geek squad and after a week, they could not fix it. They tell me its something wrong with the manufacturer and to contact them. Geek squad gives me this number, 800-624-9896. I call them, get the Dell menu and speak to a representative. He takes control of my computer and shows me that the drivers are not working and need to be repaired. For some reason, even though this is obviously a fault in manufacturing, it is not covered under warranty. He tells me that they can fix it but it will be $179.99. No way am I paying that to fix this. I hang up and tell my friend about it and she suggests trying to get some sort of refund so I call back. I get a different representative, tell him I just called and want to see about getting a refund. He gives me this number to call, 1-800-425-2067. It's a BS line to pay $59.99 to win a cruise to the Caribbean. I get extremely angry call back the exact number i just called twice, get the Dell menu, get the exact same representative tell him about the BS number he gave and he asks, what company amd I trying to reach? Dell obviously. He tells me this isn't Dell and hangs up on me. I could't make this up even if I wanted to. I suggest you don;t bother buying any sort of Dell."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "Overall, this is a great product for the money. The reason I am writing this review is because most of the top rated review are first impressions or don't voice any of the concerns I've had with this laptop and other Dells like it (most notably Inspirons in general).\n\nAfter 3-4 months of use, I had an issue with the upper left corner of the laptop starting to split apart from the casing. It was only cosmetic at first so I tried to ignore it, but eventually any time I opened or closed the laptop it would make very uncomfortable noises. It got to the point that it would sometimes split so far upon opening that the charger port fell in. So I sent it in for repair and when I got it back everything was fine. The issue now is that the same exact problem in the same exact spot is happening now, despite the very gentle usage it has gotten since the repair. Searching online, a lot of people have problems with their Dell Inspiron hinges and casements in those corners. So be wary of that ahead of time.\n\nOutside of that issue, this laptop is a great bang for the buck. It is a solid Windows 10 laptop that can run a lot of intensive games. It will run Skyrim with quite a few graphics mods, Battlefield 4, and many other popular PC games. It won't run newer games like Witcher 3 on higher graphics settings, but you should know getting a gaming PC is going to be less economic than building your own PC."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "This is a fantastic value and a great laptop overall for gaming and entertainment. It can run current titles and run them well. I'd say everything looks at least as good and normally better than a current gen console. For a lot of PC gamers that's not enough but I still say it's very impressive for a rather budget priced laptop. I have personally tested Fallout 4, Rocket League, The Witcher 3 and No Man's Sky along w/ some others. I typically use the NVidia recommend settings and it is mid range for most games w/ a nice, smooth framerate. I had a bit of trouble w/ No Man's Sky but that is No Man's Sky for you.\n\nI use this PC a lot for watching TV and Movies. The 15\" screen is a good size for sitting it on a coffee table and watching from the couch. The screen looks nice and the sound is pretty good for a laptop though it's nice to plug it into some real speakers for listening to music or watching movies. It has a little subwoofer built in but it's still pretty weak on bass frequencies. I almost always plug into my stereo or listen on headphones.\n\nAs far as feel, it's definitely solid. The keyboard is no mechanical keyboard but feels good enough to me and seems to  have a bit more life to it than most laptop keyboards. I use this thing a lot and haven't had any trouble w/ jacks or USB ports going bad. This is mostly a stationary laptop so I can't say how well it travels but it's a bit heavy so you want a backpack most likely as it's pretty big and heavy. It has taken a couple spilled glasses of water and a little beer here and there and has kept working like a champ.\n\nThe extra software on this is not too bad but there is some like you always find when purchasing basically any pre-built computer. I actually use the NVidea GeForce Experience app so I left it on there and the Dell software is relatively unobnoxious so no real complaints there. It is better in this regard than any make of laptop I've run across in the last few years and I work w/ computers for a living so I see a lot.\n\nOverall, I'm sold. I was skeptical of any laptop claiming to be a gaming laptop for this price but this is a more than capable machine. It is not pushing top specs but I'd imagine you are not going to run into many titles you can't play over the next few years."}

These \"gaming\" laptops need ISOLATED cooling solutions because when the gpu is stressed it cools ok, when the cpu is stressed it cools ok, but when both the cpu and gpu are stressed expect 95c degrees on the cpu and 89c degrees on the gpu.

Best laptop this poor old teacher ever had, even better than the used Dell Studio 1555 that I loved...\nAfter two months, though, the screen had a burned white spot. This was the beginning of May. Sent it in for replacement. Dell was all nice and efficient with that. Sent shipping box, free postage, etc. Got the unit back, but the screen had a white flickering. Dell Online Support ran diagnostic this and diagnostic that and finally agreed that they needed to look at it again. A week went by as there was a miss communication about packaging. I thought I was getting a new FedEx box overnight but Dell wanted me to use the same box the repaired unit came back in. I could be the one in the wrong on that as I have a hard time understanding the accents of some of the Dell Agents. It is now June-ish.\nGot the unit back. The flickering is still there and all the USB ports are not 3.0 but 2.0 and one is unresponsive and another possibly old 1.1 standard. Again round and round with online diagnostic this and diagnostic that. Unit sent in again. I live in a small town so overnight FedEx isn't real, because now between the delays of getting a new shipping box, using the unit to see if everything is okay (again) as per Dell Support it is now July.\nUnit comes back after long delay for out of stock part, I/O cable. The motherboard has been replaced again along with the daughterboard, and several cables this and that.\nHowever, the connection for the second bay drive is missing....\nI email my 'concerns' to Dell Technical Support. No response for 36 hours until a \"We're sorry due to heavy volume. Please email a time to call you direct.\" I emailed them then no call. I called Technical Support. The person on the other line can't do anything because my case is elevated above his 'responsibility' but go ahead and email another time for a direct phone call.\nI did, but there was no response nor confirmation like had happened previously over the course of the summer. Midway through waiting for the call, I got on Dell Chat to see if they would simply send me the missing cable. The online guy argued with me about the machine initially coming with a connection for the second drive. It did. I took the second drive out each time I sent it in for repairs because all my important file were on it but left the connecting cable because what the Hell would I do with it?\nFinally, the online guy named Mohammad Johnny relinquished and said he would simply send me the cable like he was doing me a favor. Thanks. It's now August. I'm waiting for a cable so my unit is fully functional like I want it to be and I swear, I see the screen flicker once in a while."}

The screen was black but the laptop was on, the fans were on but I could not turn it off even with the power button. It's either the laptop's fault or windows 10. Here I am now ranting in front of my broken laptop."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "TL;DR: just do it.\n\nI've been using this laptop for a couple days now and must say that I'm pretty impressed. At first I was skeptical due to some bad reviews on this product regarding the wi-fi, the trackpad, software and what not. How ever, after looking at many different options on Amazon and the internet I came to the conclussion that this was the best value you'd get money and performance wise.\n\nI'll go over the things I like and dislike about this machine and hopefully you'll be able to relate with me. I'm a college student majoring in Finance which means that I needed a machine capable of handling multiple excel sheets open at once, powerpoint, word, a web browser, and a coding GUI most of the time. How ever I also wanted something that I could use for entertainment on my free time. I was never big on computer gaming because I never had a decent machine, but this definitely allows me to both game and work magnificently.\n\nThe laptop is quick, snappy and responsive. The 15.6\" screen is good for the graphics in games and watching digital media, how ever it seems like words and letters look blurry. It's not a deal breaker for me but the blacks in words could be sharper.\n\nThe keyboard is nice, but it's taking me some time to get used to. I like to think my hands are regular sized and considering my last laptop was a 17\" one, I'm used to having more leg room between keys. You understand, right? Keys are somewhat cramped together for my taste, and so is the numeric key pad. I must add that the keys feel mushy, not the actual typing, but the keyboard keys themselves have a rubber finish. I'd say it feels like typing on semi-wet paint and I fear the keys will wear off eventually.\n\nThe trackpad is not an issue for me since I'll more likely than not use a mouse always. How ever I've played a bit with the trackpad and it's... not horrible. The trackpad has no texture so I've found myself trying to scroll on the laptop's casing and is also located oddly. It's way to the left and feels off to use when laying on a bed or handling the machine with one hand. I usually find myself hitting right click instead of left, given the position it's found in.\n\nSpeakers are decent. Don't expect high quality audio from them but they are good enough to play music for yourself or audio from a movie if you intend to netflix and chill on your own or with someone else. I've noticed that taking it to the highest volume makes the sound crackle, but I don't see why I would need to do so.\n\nGaming on this machine is out of this world. At least for me. Before this the most graphic intense game I had been able to play was probably Diablo 3, while running on low settings. With this I've been able to play Guild Wars 2 at ultra settings and have absolutely no FPS drops. I game mostly on my PS4 thus I've yet to try other titles on this laptop, but I'm pretty sure this will run all your favorite AAA games at high definition.\n\nThis is the first laptop I buy for myself (the previous ones being gifts from my father) and I must admit it feels nice knowing I made an excelent purchase. Like I said, I'm in college and needed something that can handle multiple tasks at once. Check. But also a machine that would allow me to play the games I always wanted to play. Check. I like it, I'm happy, I'm enjoying it. Whether you need to finish assignments, papers, codes or just game through the weekend, this laptop will most definitely get the job done."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "Great laptop. Had a couple of issues starting up, such as bios updates and speaker lag and popping, but those were easily remedied with driver updates. I can play project cars on optimized settings with invidia, and it runs really well. CPU temps stay under 80 degrees Celsius, and GPU temps stay under 75 degrees. Great if you want to game on a tight budget."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "Bought this laptop straight out from Dell.\nThis laptop is simply amazing for budget gamers. Granted quality wise, it will not be as you wanted it to be but it is not a push over laptop unless you litterally push it over and break it. Keyboard feels ok, and touchpad is just plain not good but since it's a gaming laptop, a mouse should already be there on ur desk. Screen color is super inaccurate; I suggest you try to calibrate the color to your own custom through Intel control pannel.\nGaming wise, it will not run everything at full on high graphic, but most games should run 60fps at 1080p low-mid graphics.\nPortability wise, well, it's a gaming laptop and not that heavy so I don't expect you'll have any problem bringing it around with you.\nThis is a budget laptop. So don't expect its quality to be like Razer 2016. For $800 + ~$100 for SSD and Ram, this is just perfect for casual gamers/college students.\nIf you use it right, this laptop can probably last you around 2-3 more years.\nVoting 4 stars for Dell's first good step toward budget gaming laptop."}

I play Fallout 4, on here with no problems at all. I don't really game that heavily, so this laptop was perfect. I play games like Starbound, Fallout 4, Terraria, Don't starve.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "For the price, you simply can't beat this laptop.\n\nI replaced my aging XPS 15 L502X (i7-2720QM, GT540M, 16 gigs RAM, 250 gig SSD) with this one, and couldn't be happier.\n\nPros:\n- Fast CPU. Wish I would have held out for the i7-6700HQ, but the i5 is plenty quick for everything right now.\n- Fast GPU. Plays everything I throw at it respectably. Not as fast as my gaming desktop but you have to make some sacrifices for portability.\n- Multiple drives. First thing I did when this arrived was pop a 1TB drive I had laying around in the empty bay.\n- Super easy to work on. One screw takes off the entire bottom panel, giving you access to everything. Reminds me of Precision mobile workstations.\n- Backlit keyboard. You never know how nice this can be until you have to use a system in a poorly lit room. I touchtype 100+ wpm and still find a backlit keyboard to be a necessity.\n- Single SoDIMM installed. Makes upgrading that much cheaper - don't have to replace two sticks.\n\nCons:\n- Sandisk z400s SSD is a bit sluggish compared to a higher-end SSD. Also, SATA instead of PCIe.\n- Touchpad is weedy. Buttons are part of the pad itself, not separate pieces.\n- Rubbery plastic is a finger print magnet, always looks smudged and greasy. I find myself cleaning it constantly.\n- Speakers are kind of weak, at least compared to the excellent sound my old XPS put out.\n- WiFi card is a 1x1, only connects at 433 Mbps.\n- CPU is soldered to the board. If I want to upgrade to the i7 later, I have to replace the entire system board.\n- Only 3 USB ports. Mouse in one, game controller in another... I'll have to get a hub to pack around.\n- DDR3 memory. This CPU and the HM170 chipset can use faster DDR4.\n\nAll of these cons aside from the CPU upgrade issue are easily dealt with or just gotten over - this is still the best laptop I've ever owned.\n\nSince purchase, I have upgraded to 16 gigs of RAM and replaced the WiFi card with a 2x2 for 867 Mbps. I have a 2TB drive arriving tomorrow, and will be replacing the Sandisk SSD with a 500 gig Samsung unit soon.\n\nFollow-up:\n\nStill very happy with this laptop. I've added the 2TB drive, a Logitech G700S wireless mouse, and a Steam controller, so I'm all set for gaming on the go. SSD upgrade is still planned, just hasn't happened yet.\n\nSecond follow-up:\n\nReplaced the 256GB Sandisk z400s with a 500GB Samsung 850 EVO m. 2 SSD. In addition to the extra space, it's noticeably faster.  I'm very happy with this system and recommend it whole-heartedly."}

I was wary of the negative reviews but had none of the problems that the bad reviews mention, though I guess there is always a chance that one can receive a defective product. Looking at amazon reviews every laptop, even macbooks have around 10% defective product rate ... apparently quality control is a thing of the past, now its pure luck.\n\nThe system is stable, Windows 10 is not as great as Windows 7 but it isn't as bad as 8 or Vista ... with time (updates) it might actually end up being the next decent Windows OS. The dell auto-update app didn't work for me, I had to go to the dell website, enter my Service Tag, download their system detect and install the recommended driver\\bios upgrades. Nvidia drivers upgraded fine through its own application.\n\nThe Graphics card is very decent for a laptop. Playing Witcher 3 with HBAO+ shader and Nvidia's recommended settings(most things on Ultra, HairWorks on Low)  I get consistent 30+ FPS, including in Novigrad.\n\nThe keyboard is satisfactory, keys seem to be full size and typing produces satisfactory auditory response(its not a silent keyboard). The back-light is white and that doesn't look cool. The touchpad is barely acceptable: the clicking keys on the touchpad are flimsy and there is no separation between them, so sometimes left-click engages the right-click and vice versa. Sensitivity and feel is alright, I've seen much worse, but for gaming a mouse is essential.\n\nThe SSD is low on space (only 256 GB) but there is an additional port for adding an additional drive, and though small, the SSD is naturally lightning fast (boots in seconds, loads witcher levels in seconds ... both took minutes on my last machine with a HDD).\n\nThe screen is crisp, back-lit and has a wide viewing angle. The only problem is that the machine comes with (and suggests) a 1920 x 1080 resolution which is perhaps too high for such a small screen, everything looks unnaturally tiny. Windows 10 has a zooming option that helps a little but its doen't fix everything. Currently I've set chrome to zoom text by 125% and Windows to zoom stuff by 150% and now it feels somewhat reasonable."}

I was looking for months to find a computer for college and i just couldn't find one like this for cheaper, everything else was at least $850. I got this because it has all the features i would need to play modern games and i can upgrade it if need be. It works great, boots up fast, keyboard is very nice (although the backspace is a little small for my taste but thats just me), the touchpad is a little big but not hard to adjust to and it works very well. I also like having the calculator number pad as i really don't like using the top keys if i done have to. All in all its great. Also the speakers are WAY better than i imagined. I had to turn them down to 23% when i got the computer they were so good, they have nice bass and surround, no problem if you don't have a headset (i do but in any case these speakers are awesome). I would definitely recommend this to someone on a budget but they want the most out of their money."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "By far the best bang for your buck in terms of laptop performance.\n\nPros:\n-Skylake Core i5 HQ processor (quad-core hyper-threaded). This processor is significantly more powerful than the Core i5 \"U\" processors you'll find in most new laptops. It eats more power, of course, but it's worth it if you're just after performance.\n-A respectable video card. Many comparable laptops are using the 940M instead of the 960M, which is a very significant difference. I wouldn't consider anything running a 940M when you can get a device with a 960M for this kind of money.\n-Inside components are fairly accessible, making me confident that this thing would be serviceable if there was a hardware problem.\n\nCons:\n-Red case highlights, while more subtle than some gaming laptops out there, still screams \"I'm an uber h4x0r gaming laptop!\" This annoys me greatly. I hate that OEM's feel the need to add a bunch of flare on the case. I'd rather my laptops simply look classy on the outside so they can be used in both professional and personal environments.\n-Very heavy.\n-Very thick.\n-Case made of plastic. Feels flimsy. This is, of course, a trade off for the price point.\n\nConclusion:\nAgain, in terms of raw power, this is presently the best deal out there. However, considering how heavy this thing is, how bulky, and how fragile the plastic feels, I would imagine some might be inclined to reconsider whether or not they'd really just be better off building a desktop, and using Steam in-home streaming to a more lightweight, lap-friendly laptop. Still, this laptop will fit the bill for someone who doesn't want to have to lug their desktop PC to a LAN party."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "Came with the privacy nightmare that is Windows 10, and I had a hell of a time getting Windows 7 installed on this laptop. I had to modify a Windows 7 installer to include USB 3.0 drivers because this laptop only has USB 3.0 ports and no true USB 2.0 emulation mode in the BIOS, and once the Windows 7 installer booted up it could no longer detect the installation medium it was on and therefore could not complete the installation.\n\nIt was also a struggle to find drivers for this laptop since the OEM's no longer provide drivers. I basically I had to look up hardware ID's in device manager and mix and match drivers from other manufacturers to get all the drivers installed. The video card has issues when you bring the laptop out of sleep, it's as though the NVIDIA graphics chip never wakes back up, and I have to reboot otherwise games try to use the integrated Intel graphics. It would have been nice to have a motherboard option to disable the Intel graphics, but unfortunately this laptop didn't come with one.  The subwoofer also doesn't work on Windows 7 because I couldn't find a recent DELL sound driver that supported it. The speakers make some weird crackling noises every so often when it first starts playing any kind of sound. The laptop also only comes with a single channel 8 GB RAM stick, which affects performance by about 20% according to some of my own measurements; I ended up upgrading to a 16 GB dual channel configuration.\n\nI do like the charger , the keyboard layout, keyboard backlight, and the expandable hard drive bay they included. Opening the bottom and installing RAM and hard drives was a breeze, as well as cleaning out dust from the fans. The screen looks pretty nice, the colors are vivid and everything seems crisp.\n\nIf anyone knows of a OEM Windows 7 version for this specific laptop let me know."}

The laptop came in a well packed box. I did not want to write a review immediately. I thought I would write it somewhere in March or April but kept procrastinating and writing it very late.\n\nPros:\nThe laptop has a great configuration. It is very fast even when running ram intensive applications like Photoshop, Informatica, Oracle etc. It is because of the SSD. The graphic card is not a high end one but relatively one of the best in this laptop price range.  Overall the performance was definitely great and I had no problem running any application for that matter\n\nCons:\nThe touch pad feels like very low quality plastic and the sound it makes (tak tak) every time I use it...Awww feels so irritating and cheap. I shouldnt say it feels cheap. It is definitely built out of cheap quality plastic. The display is IPS but it does not deliver great contrast and colors compared to its competitors. I use photoshop a lot for my photography stuff during those times I feel I could have got something better but it isn't very bad on a scale of 10 I would rate the display 6.5/10. The WIFI when connecting to 5GHZ connections creates problems. It kept disconnecting intermittently which was annoying when I work from home.

I've read other reviewers say the keyboard and the trackpad are some of the cons but I actually like the keyboard, and the trackpad works great. I can see how the trackpad can get a little annoying at times because you can click on the left and right buttons just fine, but they both just happen to be touch sensitive also, so if I hesitate on pressing one of them, the touch sensitivity tends to kick in and clicks it unintentionally. The screen is great, love the resolution but it's nothing to gawk over. This one came with a 256GB M.2 SSD which works great, I didn't know Windows could load that fast. I Also bought another 8 GB stick of ram to max it out at 16GB and added a 500GB HDD that I had lying around for extra storage. The GTX 960m also works pretty damn good. I wouldn't consider myself a gamer but I have a few on Steam that I have no issues playing on this.\n\nThe 802.11AC wireless adapter works just fine, getting pretty fast connection speed compared to N. Overall I think I made a good decision buying this laptop. I got it for $739 used, but when I received it, it was practically brand new, no finger prints, and came in the original box just re-taped shut. I think Dell is a pretty reliable manufacturer also.

But when you boot up games and software it's sweet.\n\nI highly recommend this laptop to anyone looking to play games at below the 1k price point."}

It runs hot while gaming but nothing that an aftermarket cooler can't fix. It has a nice, clean design that says \"hey this is a gaming laptop\" without being way too flamboyant. My biggest gripe so far is that the track pad just plain sucks. The buttons are indistinguishable from the rest of the pad so I lose track of my fingers all the time. The speakers are also pretty disappointing but they had to skimp somewhere to jam that much power into a laptop this cheap. Overall I'm satisfied with the purchase and I'm confident it's the best deal you'll find in terms of pure power/cost ratio."}

Some newer games you will need to tweet the settings. Grim dawn runs a little shaky on this rig.\n\nFirst , I had some issues with my order but the Amazon staff was amazing and can't thank them enough.\n\nBefore you order this , it's good to have computer knowledge. There are some very major flaws with this laptop out the box. I hope the steps below help you if you decide to purchase.\n\n1. Download the wifi driver from Intel not dell. The card has issues with dropping connection and the dell driver does not fix this.\n\n2. Download bios driver and install. From dell.\n\n3. Update ssd firmware driver from dell.\n\n4. Update nvidia driver. It will do it automatically by either going to your task bar or right clicking on your desktop and opening the nvidia control panel.\n\n5. Sound card pops there is a registry fix. Google your model and sound pop for solution.\n\nIt will take about an hour but do the steps above before gaming.\n\nFan can kick on a lot , improvements like disabling cortana, one drive help with this and overall performance.\n\nI'm happy so far with the laptop. The specs can't be beat for the price tag. It needs a little attention out of the box though.\n\nThe track pad sucks to high hell but I knew that going in.\n\nYou may want another hard drive down the road , you are left with under 200g pretty quick.\n\nAnyways, so far it's a solid buy. I'll update if I run into any problems."}

I wanted a laptop that would enable me to sit on the couch and play games, instead of having to use my desktop all of the time.  I am absolutely blown away by how good this thing is.  The games I have tried so far are: Skyrim, GTA 5, FIFA 16, Fallout 4, Elite Dangerous, WoW, Diablo 3, Overwatch. MGS 5, Far Cary 4, and BF 4.  I can run all of these games at 1920 x 1080 at very high detail, and with so many pixels crammed into a 15\" screen, the games look gorgeous and play very smoothly.  I haven't checked the FPS but the gameplay is so smooth it doesn't matter.  It came with a 256GB SSD and I added a 700GB regular hard drive because there was an spare drive bay.  The screen is nice.  It claims to have a subwoofer but you can't really tell - it sounds like any other laptop, so use headphones if you want good bass.  The keyboard is fine, and the trackpad is ok but I use an external wireless mouse so that's irrelevant.  I am VERY pleased with the performance of this laptop and would recommend it to anyone."}

I'm typically an HP guy but they didn't have anything close to this for the price. My 2015 HP Spectre 360 is a great machine but has no dedicated graphics and struggles with screen artifacts while gaming, whereas the dedicated 4GB graphics controller in this Dell make that a non-issue.\n\nValue-wise, a standard SSD and the aforementioned 4GB of dedicated graphics in a laptop at this price is unheard of, at least at the time I bought this earlier in 2016. The extra HDD slot, with cable ready for you to connect a new SSD, is very handy too - it's a five minute job at most and requires no skill (except the ability to operate a screwdriver).\n\nIn actual use, this thing plays World of Tanks at 60fps with full graphics with absolutely no problems. In fact, it plays it so well I'm thoroughly addicted to that %^&$'ing game!\n\nThe days of the monstrous dedicated gaming towers is rapidly coming to a close, at least for the gaming I do. Buy it!"}

I wanted to play dark souls 3 and this notebook runs it smoothly which is all i wanted in the first place. I also bought another 8 gb ram (the one amazon sugests) and it is stupid easy to install because of the one screw mechanism at the bottom, i don't know if its useful or necessary (defenitely not necessary i guess) to have 16gb intead of 8gb but who cares, for $30 i didn't think it  that much anyway. Also, i recomend buying or salvaging from an old notebook a 2.5'' HDD because the 250gb SSD will probably fall short in the long run (it's also super easy to install).\nThere are some bad things  with this computer i guess, although i haven't really experienced it by myself because i use a wireless mouse, it seems like the mousepad is a bit s***ty, also, because there isn't a light for the NUM LOCK key (like the one the caps lock key has) so there is no way of knowing beforehand if im really typing numbers or not. Also, and this one is for people with greasy hands like me, because of the matte finish the computer has, the grease smudges you leave are noticeable.\nIn conclusion im really happy with Dark Souls 3, it's a must buy *.\n\nI think it's a must buy now (July 2016) but i guess that in around 2-3 months a newer version with the 10xxm gtx Nvidia card will be released so maybe it's better to wait for a newer version."}

This would happen every 20-40 minutes on average.\n\nI called dell support and went through troubleshooting. They said it could be a motherboard issue and mailed me a bit to ship it to them.\n\n7-10 days later I receive an email that the fixes needed for the computer are outside warranty. I was told by the tech \"The chassis has a crack in it, the lcd and the motherboard are completely ruined and we cannot fix it.\"\n\nBecause this laptop sat on my desk, having never been moved except the day it arrived and the day I shipped it to dell support, having never received ant physical damage, I can only surmise that they:\n\n1)  Shipped to me with a faulty motherboard\n\n2) The laptop was damaged either in transit or at their facilty.\n\nThe tech told me all they can do is ship it back and I can take it to a local tech not covered by warranty.\n\nThis is one of the worst experiences I've ever had with any electronic.

I live in Nigeria(Africa), and with the constant lack of power supply, having a laptop with a good battery is a MUST. I get more than 5 hours watching movies while running on battery power and in 'power saver' mode; much more hours when I'm doing light work like typing ; but I get less than an hour when I'm doing demanding tasks like gaming...\nAll in all, it's awesome. the only complaints I have are:\n1. The track pad. it's not terrible, but it could have been better. its not very sensitive ; sometimes, I have to click it twice-or even thrice-for it to respond, but it's still ok.\n2 The rubber finish. it looks very simple and nice, but the rubber tends to scratch easily ; so if you're conscious about how clean your laptop looks, you might want to get an extra layer of protection for the body. I'm someone like that, so I added a sticker for decoration and slight protection, lol\nOnce you upgrade the RAM to 16 gig, everything is all the more better. you get 15.9 gig worth of usable RAM, which is awesome ; because most computers of the same RAM size give you much less usable memory.\nSo yeah, this will be a good purchase for anyone.

Keep in mind, your paying $800 for a gaming laptop so don't expect to pull this thing out and see the performance of an Alienware or a gaming desktop.

I have yet to try and run high demanding games (such as Overwatch and The Witcher) but I have no doubt that this laptop can run it at a medium setting.\nTHE PROS:\n- The hardware your getting for the price.\n- Looks super sleek.\n- Big screen.\n- Run most games with no struggle and they look good at that.\n- Usually hate most laptop keyboards, LOVE this one.\n- Impressed with the WiFi. Heard bad things before I purchased but I have had no problems.\n- The dual fans are nice and the laptop stays cool for the most part.\n- Having a solid state drive is almost a requirement for me now-a-days, glad this came with one.\n- Windows 10 is excellent.\n\nCONS:\n- My goodness the trackpad is awful. I WILL NOT use this laptop without a mouse.\n- The speakers won't blow you away by any means. I suggest using headphones for the best sound quality.\n- The color rendering isn't that great on this screen. I wouldn't suggest this PC for Photoshop/Web Graphic work.\n- Have had for a week and have had a few bugs:\n  - The chargers sometimes says its not compatible and won't charge. The quick fix is just unplug and replug it in.\n  - Some games I need to CTRL + ALT + DEL when the game launches (or else screen stays black, this is only one a FEW games)\n\nI am usually a Mac user but I wanted a PC for gaming, which this was perfect for me. I am a full time web developer and I honestly wouldn't use this for my Front End work or photoshop work, I will continue to use the Mac for these tasks.

It is a 15.6 in laptop, with this comes the extra size of the laptop and it is of course a bit heavy, but overall maintains a slim profile when closed, and the case has a nice finish that provides enough grip and doesn't show fingerprints for days like many gloss finishes do.\n2. Laptop comes equipped with a SSD drive off the bat which is great, but even better. This laptop has a SECOND hard drive bay. Simply pop open the single screw that holds the back on and there is a SECOND hard drive bay. I purchased a 250 GB Crucial SSD and threw it in there, go ahead and format the drive, 5 minutes later I had doubled the storage capacity for approximately $90.\n3. Laptop comes with 8GB of ram stock but wanting a bit more I purchased a 16gb kit of Crucial ram, and popped that in.\nTotal modification time ~10 minutes. And $200.\n4. Graphics are pretty solid on this machine, will it run games at the same level that a gaming desktop will, of course not. But it is great for casual gaming paired with a Xbox 360 controller it is a pretty good gaming rig.\n5. So cost, I purchased the laptop and the second hard drive and extra ram and it was under a $1k total, its great!\n\nOverall I really like the laptop, one or two things that aren't perfect.\n1. Touchpad isn't as sensitive as that of a MacBook, but what is? I use a external mouse usually so not a huge issue.\n2. Be prepared to have to update the WiFi drivers when you receive it, I had to as it had issues staying connected to a Wifi network.

I immediately call Dell customer support, who has me on there for three hours, then smugly announces it's a software issue and proceeds to reinstall Windows, as I'm told this is a mandatory step before we can move forward.  OK, except for the fact that I've been a technician for a decade and this was clearly a hardware issue.  This laptop was earmarked to be used for school (as well as some gaming), and now I'm afraid to use it for anything remotely intensive.  10-14 days for repair just isn't acceptable for a laptop I've had less than three months.  Plus, how am I supposed to have the slightest bit of faith in them?  I'm posting this here in the hopes that someone with Amazon can potentially help me out as a customer.  I'm not looking for something for nothing, I'd just like a replacement that isn't faulty."}

I will say that most graphic consuming games do set me to \"low\" by default, but... I get the feeling that is not quite due to this Laptops Specs. At times, the game will read the wrong graphics card ( Intel HD, yes there are 2 graphics cards on this laptop ). I have played with the Settings some, but really, I see no difference from \"low\" to \"high\", the Laptop performs the same either way, no issues. Overall, just a solid Gaming Laptop, perhaps \"Gamers\" will have holes to poke in it, but for me, I have everything I want for an amazing price. Ill list the good and bad ( for me ):\n\nThe Good! -\n- Never Lags, Freezes or Crashes ( Ok, I lied, it did crash ONCE, and only one time )\n- Well built, hinges are good, power cord still in tact, nothing has fallen apart! ( Love that )\n- Ive played all the top games with no issues!\n- SSD is very easy to upgrade, there is a hatch on the underside of the Laptop to add more!\n- Very Quiet, ive heard no noises\nThe Bad:\n- Yes, the Track Pad is just garbage. Poorly built. It seems to work, but i use a USB Mouse instead, so i never touch it\n- I hear complaints about \"Screen Bleed\"... yes there is a little, however, when would you ever notice unless the screen is black?\n- Sound is terrible... just really bad! I've got external speakers instead.\n- SSD Memory is LOW, but luckily very easy to upgrade! I can only have 2-3 games installed at once."}

I use it almost daily to play WoW, Hearthstone, and Fallout 4, and I have yet to have any problems. Old laptops would frequently overheat, but this one barely gets warm.

It's a great machine, blazing fast, runs all the latest games at 60FPS. The build quality isn't perfect, but good, very solid. It is a bit of a fingerprint magnet but I lived with it. The speakers are great - very loud, decent bass. The only complaint I have is the touch pad isn't wonderful but it works.\n\nUnfortunately my computer had an issue where it would lock up on a black screen and wouldn't respond to anything but holding down the power button to turn it off. After several phone calls with Dell support they agreed to repair it. Great! Repairs went fine, and I was happy to be up and running again.... Except the problem returned. This time I had a Dell rep confirm to me that it's a known hardware issue and the solution is to disable the integrated Intel graphics. I was okay with this until I discovered this means I can no longer suspend my pc! When I called back I had no less that four dell reps hang up on me after I gave them my pc's serial number. When I finally got someone willing to help I sent the pc in for repairs again. Upon getting it back I found they had only reinstalled windows, and the problem showed up again within ten minutes of booting it up! Dell didn't even bother letting it run for ten minutes after I explained many times its an intermittent issue that may take an hour or two to show up. AND it's a known hardware issue, but their solution was to reinstall windows, which I tried quite a few times (and told them I had done so as well).\n\nFortunately Amazon agreed to refund me even though I'm well outside the return window. I will never buy a Dell again, I love the hardware but God help you if you have any sort of issue with it."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "Just played Overwatch for 3 hours straight.  Brilliant.  With a mix of Medium, High and a low (shadows, fog).  It never dips below 60 fps and runs at native resolution with great detail.  After reading pretty much all of the reviews.  The consensus is pretty accurate.  Great laptop for the money but with my short time with it, I can see the drawbacks that make this thing truly great.  I'll address some of the major pros and cons based on my first impressions.\n\nCons:\n\n-Screen\nQuite dull and not very colorful.  Something seems off.  Viewing angles are pretty decent and I like the matte finish.  But the screen won't wow you.  It works quite well while gaming so can't complain there.:\n\n**Keyboard and Trackpad**\nKeyboard flex is not an issue unless you push really hard.  Keys are definitely mushy.  Easy to type but lifeless.  Benefit of that is that it's very quite since the strikes deaden due to the clunkiness.  The trackpad however, is abysmal.  Worst trackpad I've ever used period.  So if your thinking productivity and not always using a mouse, think again.\n\n**Speakers**\nSpeakers are strange, like sometimes it seems like the sound comes from the  left only, or its coming from another computer elsewhere.  Quite poorly designed.  Iphone seems more adequate.\n\nPros:\n\n**Upgradeability**\nPut in an extra 8GB stick and my old 128GB in litterally about 10 seconds flat (took a minute to get the backplate off as it was a little troublesome, screw got stuck)\n\n**Battery**\nI game when plugged in, but as I sit here and type this, after being on battery for about 30 minutes.  It's at 94% with 9 hours left.  I expect 6-7 hours from this with web-browsing.\n\n**Graphics**\nI wanted to play Overwatch without many compromises and it delivers.  It can play most games at medium settings at 40fps.  Perfectly fine for the price.\n\nOverall:\n\nFor the price, I can't complain.  Really love the overall build and the fact that you can easily upgrade ram and hard drives in seconds.  Doesn't get very warm and while a bit heavy, feels very sturdy.  The trackpad is by far the most disappointing, followed closely by the keyboard.  I would give it 3 stars since it is a laptop and these should be better, but the price, gaming prowess, battery and design get it up to a 4.\n\nIf you're like me and need a cheap laptop that can game, then this is it.  This will be great to tide you over until next gen graphics come out on mobile or if you're looking for a mac, when apple decides to make computers again."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "Handles all of the games I play great (BF4 and WoW) at 1080p 60fps! I'm only running them low/medium settings since I want 60fps consistently. Boots up quick thanks to the SSD. Temps are pretty good, usually never goes past 60 C when gaming so fans are still pretty quiet. Touch pad is a pain to use so I always just use a mouse which isn't a big deal for me since I prefer a mouse anyway. The screen looks great since I prefer to have matte finished monitors since glare completely kills the experience of playing on a computer for me and I also do not care about color accuracy. First thing I did after testing it to see if it works and I liked it was reinstall Windows since Dell puts all the garbage programs on there that just take up space and run in the background.  Since I reinstalled Windows I also reinstalled and updated lots of drivers which fixes the speaker crackling and WiFi dripping I and lots of other reviewers have mentioned. The keyboard and the outer areas of the laptop get fingerprints incredibly easily, I've tried isopropyl alcohol since it's what I use for my desktop and keyboard which work great but not this laptop so if anyone has any suggestions please let me know.\n\nTL;DR\nGreat laptop.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "Awesome bargain! It's not often that you find such good specs in such a cheap machine. It's well-designed and, so far, reliable as well.\n\nThe dedicated graphics card is great for gaming. If you've been gaming on a crappy Intel card you're missing out. It won't run the most high end games but it runs mid-range games with good settings. It speeds up web browsing a little too because most browsers are hardware-accelerated these days.\n\nThe SSD is amazing; I never want to go back to an old-style HDD. It boots up in seconds, loads programs quickly, and does so at low power without making a peep. The 256GB may not be enough, but there's even a second drive slot: just pop the back cover off and slid in another drive if you run out of space. I added the 1TB HDD from my old machine for big files. It's obviously designed for upgrades: it opens up with just one screw.\n\nBattery life is stellar, at least according to the estimate on the screen. It says about 9 hours, which is incredible for such a powerful machine. I suspect this is due in part to the SSD, and also a pretty colossal battery.\n\nThe screen's not quite as stellar. It has a matte finish so colors may seem a little washed out. But it's acceptable, for me at least. The keyboard's no Cherry MX but works well; the dedicated numpad is nice for those who use certain software (i.e. Blender).\n\nI have a couple more tiny gripes. The touchpad is loose, mushy and a little unreliable. I use an external mouse, so I don't care, but others might. The charger plug also glows bright blue even when it's not plugged into the laptop, which is slightly annoying but not a big deal. If you put too much of a load on the hardware, the fan suddenly clicks on to full power and it's pretty loud. Fortunately it cools things back down pretty quick, but I wish it had a more linear response to keep from heating up in the first place. My biggest gripe is that the body has a slightly rubbery finish that feels nice but is very prone to smudging. The case has an attractive, angular look and stylish red accents; it's a shame that such a nice-looking case is so tarnished by slightly oily fingers. Still, this is a small issue and not a deal-breaker unless you really care about having the absolute most fancy-looking computer on the block.\n\nOverall, this laptop has been VERY reliable in the few months I've had it. I've used it daily for weeks without rebooting with very few issues. This looks like the best laptop option for gamers and power users on a budget. Highly recommended!"}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "Update: I know this laptop is aging but i thought id give an update to anyone still interested in it. Now approaching 5 months use i can attest to the following changes in my original review. On the plus side the touchpad seems to be more responsive now that its broken in and has a \"polished\" surface. The battery still holds up very well (4+hrs) if you do not game with it. Every part of the keyboard is still functioning correctly. Sound has a nice tone to it, which it did not when first purchased. The computer has occasional errors which crash the computer but it always seems to get back on its feet. I would say its crashed about 3 times since owning it. With all this being said the computer still performs quite well for its pricepoint. I run Dark souls 3, Fallout 4, Tomb Raider, Witcher 3 all in high settings. Some of the more graphic intensive games run at around 45-50fps but still perform quite well.\n\nThe one major complaint is the build quality. Upon first few months of owning it i noticed the rear left corner of the laptop kept unlatching. I relatched the clips that hold the two halves of the case but once i moved the screen up or down it tended to pop the clips back open. I don't know if the problem with the corner unlatching might have been caused by me handling the laptop with one hand only instead of two. Or perharps its because the hinges are stiff and they put alot of stress on the plastic/tin chassis base. Regardless of what couldve caused it i think the chassis shouldve held up. There is two screws that hold each side of the screen hinges. Upon closer inspection i noticed that the inserts that are molded in and hold down the screen hinge screws have broken off completely. This in turn caused the rest of the chassis to split open in the rear corner whenever i tilted the screen. I have opened the computer up and remedied the problem by epoxying the hinge inserts in place. Ive attached some new photos.\n\n2ND update: Now the right hinge is doing the same thing. Epoxying the inserts back into place only holds on for so long. Im going to buy a new base for it since its redundant to keep gluing these parts back together. Shouldnt be doing this on a 6month old laptop... Still good laptop hardware but the build quality is poor. If you look at customer photos you will see that i am not the only one experiencing this issue. I will invest in an aluminum chassis laptop in the future. Previous plastic chassis laptops ive owned have never had this issue.\n\nI have gone ahead and adjusted my rating from an inital 4/5 stars down to 2 stars because of these issues.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\n\nThe screen: Matte IPS 1080p screen. No complaints here everything looks really crisp. Not 4k good but still great. Has great viewing angles and the low reflection makes it great for viewing outdoors.\n\nKeyboard/Touchpad: All keys work as they should. Keyboard is backlit with a high/low off setting. I thought this would be a necessity but it's really not. The screen lights up the keyboard on its own. I find myself not using the backlit keyboard the majority of the time. Keyboard layout is good and doesn't have that funky half an up/down arrow on the arrow keys.\n\nTouchpad: To be honest it's pretty bad. You have to apply a \"more than featherlight\" amount of pressure and even then it's pretty bad at tracking. There is also no software to customize the touchpad settings like a synaptics touchpad can, such as changing finger gestures and all that.\n\nSpeakers: Sound was terrible to start with. Its an exaggeration but it sounded like one of those cheap speakers they put on hallmark cards. The driver updates actually improved overall sound. Speakers sound ok now.\n\nHardware: Obviously this is the department this laptop shines in. Great gaming performance. The included video card is on the higher end. 6th gen i5 processor keeps up with gaming but starts to show its weakness once you start opening other programs while gaming. If you don't have a game running then it handles everything else great. Included SSD is a 256gb beast, boots Windows in a matter if seconds, read/write speeds are greater than a HDD. There is an open bay if you want to add an additional HDD. 8 GB RAM is plenty but can be upgraded to 16gigs for under $40. 3 USB ports, an HDMI port, wired Ethernet connection are standard. There is no CD drive but it's not even necessary nowadays. There is an SD slot.\n\nBuild quality: I'll rate it at 4/5 stars. It is a plastic build but it's nice and ridgid. Not much creaking if any. Exterior is covered in a rubberized coating that looks nice and stealthy but is also prone to smudging.\n\nOverall it is a great budget gaming laptop. For the performance you get it is pretty cheap. I've owned it for 30 days now and have had no real issues. Any issues you have will probably be from drivers. I do notice little quirks here and there still but asking this much performance with x amount of dollars can only go so far. I would recommend this product."}

Undo a single screw to remove bottom panel and it's right there in plain sight, could be easier.\n\nPrior laptops and desktops I had used to play games on and run photoshop cs6 on took forever to do anything with. My prior laptops and desk top computers would barely touch 40 fps in several of the games I entertain myself with, but not this laptop, during some of the most graphic intense situations it was producing a consistent 97 fps. My game are much more enjoyable now.\n\nMy prior computer systems would typically take several minutes to fully load into Windows, this laptop does this in just mere seconds literally. The only thing I don't much care for is the sound quality. I feel that Dell has really dropped the ball on that considering the price point of this laptop. But it's not bad enough to be a deal killer in my opinion, but it could definitely be improved on.\n\nAnyone that purchases this laptop won't be disappointed. It's a powerhouse that's well worth the cost."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "Love this laptop. You can even uninstall the bloatware on the laptop easily. Unfortunately, there is the problem with the fact that you need some Dell software to diagnose any problems. I've had a problem with the sound in that it is a little robotic. I can deal with it, but it gets a little annoying when my favorite characters don't sound like themselves. The mousepad is also a little annoying. While typing, my left hand is resting on the mousepad. Wish that they hadn't made it like this.\n\nThe build quality can be a little better. When I'm typing, I can see the local area of the keyboard depress down with every keystroke. I would have thought that there would at least be support there, but apparently not. But at least the keyboard is very quiet, which is nice. I do have a problem on the keyboard in that the period key is broken. If it is pressed a few times on the top portion, the bottom half pops off. I've adjusted my typing style a little to compensate. However, I'm still a little annoyed. The only way to replace the key is to buy a full replacement keyboard, which I do not need."}

I recently typed this up and sent it to a co-worker and several friends so I thought I would put it in a review for everyone to view. :) Please look past any typos and grammar mistakes!\n\nQuick Description & Personal Thoughts:\n\nThis laptop can easily be upgraded by anyone. There are youtube guides if needed. Upgrading is simple by removing one screw on the bottom of the laptop and popping off the plastic plate. You can simply(and optionally) upgrade the Memory with an additional 8GB stick(<$30) or add another storage drive by plugging in a 2.5\"  storage drive(HDD or SSD). These are the quick highlights below with some of my opinions on why I chose this laptop over the Dell XPS 13 which was more expensive and had similar but not nearly as good specs. Although less powerful XPS 13 is slimmer and has more of a mac book feel because it is an \"ultra-book\".\n\nSpecs & Personal Thoughts:\n\nBattery - 6-cell 74Whr battery\n6-8+ hours with normal, non-gaming use, marketing doc says 10+ but I don't see it.\n\nCPU - i5 6300HQ,\nTrue quad core mobile processor, which is especially rare at this price point.\n\nMemory - 1 x 8GB DDR3 Stick\n8GB is good for most users, you can optionally add more later for cheap.\nEasily pop in another 8GB stick for a total of 16GB.\nI bought this memory-stick and it has been working great.\nCrucial 8GB Single DDR3/DDR3L 1600 MT/s (PC3-12800) CL11 SODIMM 204-Pin 1.35V/1.5V Memory for Mac CT8G3S160BM\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Crucial-8GB-Single-DDR3-DDR3L-1600-MT-s-PC3-12800-CL11-SODIMM-204-Pin-1-35V-1-5V-Memory-for-Mac-CT8G3S160BM/dp/B008LTBLLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Crucial 8GB Single DDR3/DDR3L 1600 MT/s (PC3-12800) CL11 SODIMM 204-Pin 1.35V/1.5V Memory for Mac CT8G3S160BM</a>\n\nStorage - M.2 Solid State Drive 256GB\nMine has SanDisk Z400s M.2 - your mileage may vary.\nBoots to login screen in about 6-7 seconds.\nNote - these drives sell with a 5 year warranty, so they should last a while.\nEmpty SATA drive slot for a 2.5\" drive if you want to add more storage later. (optional)\nI personally bought a 500GB SSD for around $100.\nAny of these Solid State Drives with good reviews on newegg/amazon should work fine. If you want the very best, go Samsung 850 Evo/Pro.\nhttp://pcpartpicker.com/products/internal-hard-drive/#t=0&S=240000,512000&f=3&qq=1&sort=a10&page=1\n\nGraphics Card - Nvidia GTX 960M 4GB GDDR5\nGood for light to mid-range gaming & light to mid-range photo/video editing\nFor reference I can run Witcher 3 with about 45 FPS without tweaking the graphics quality too much.\nI also play overwatch, diablo 3, and other \"light weight\" games like these should run great on this machine.\nI bought this machine for the other specs, the Graphics Card was an added bonus.\n\nWindows 10 Home (64 bit)\nMinimal bloatware, I uninstalled a few apps but no major bloatware. Normally, I re-install the OS as soon as I get a new laptop, but this one I just kept the stock installation.\n\nScreen - A nice 1080p IPS display with a matte finish.\n\nKeyboard - Chiclets style keyboard\nFull-Sized with number pad\nI'm not a fan of any laptop keyboard. This one gets the job done and I have no complaints.\nNon-back-lit keyboard, not an issue for me but I thought I should mention.\n\nPorts -  USB, HDMI, SD, 3.5 mm Headset/Microphone\nplenty of ports for most users see the specs for more on these."}

Nvidia allows you to choose which applications use the built in Intel graphics  and which applications use the GeForce card. Everything was defaulted to intel so I wasn't getting the video quality/speed I wanted. I went into the Nvidia settings and switched my Adobe applications over and now they run perfectly.\n\n-----------------------------\nPROS -\n>Nice loud speakers. Not a whole lot of bass, but they sound great for just sharing video clips and listening to music.\n\n>Good power. Obviously not gonna compete with my $2,000 desktop workstation, but for a laptop, this thing is nice. Especially after upgrading the RAM to 16GB and adding an additional SSD (which was super easy to install, Just a single screw and it was obvious where to install them. Just make sure you reboot a few times for the computer to detect them.\n\n>Display - The display has a resolution of 1920x1080. Now, it's not 4K, but honestly I have pretty good eyes and the normal viewing distance from my monitor, you can't really see a pixels. To me it's a nice screen, and you don't want to waste that processing power on uselessly higher resolutions.\n\n--------------------------------------\nCONS -\n>The touchpad is a little finicky. It works, but it takes some getting used to. It seems that it takes about half a second for it to realize you're trying to move it somewhere, and then it works fine. If you keep your finger on it, it detects movement just fine. If you let the mouse sit in the same spot without touching it for about 20 seconds though, it has a slight lag before it starts moving again. Not a big deal, but if you do gaming or something, you're definitely gonna want a mouse to go with this.\n\n>UPDATE: Still running great, but one thing I've definitely noticed is that the material that the laptop is made out of is very prone to getting greasy if you're hands are resting on it all day. It's not too bad, and maybe my skin is just more oily than other people's or something, but after I've used it for a little bit there is definitely a noticeable darker spot where my hands were resting below the keyboard and on the spacebar in particular. This hasn't happened to me with other laptops, or at least not as bad as this. Again, this a minor issue, but it's an issue nonetheless.\n\nOverall a great laptop so far! If I have a problems down the road, I'll make sure to come back here and edit my review."}

Updates to drivers and OS didn't take long and I was able to connect to my router straight out of the box. The problems stated about the pad are simply that it allows you to either tap or click down to left click something. So if you push it all the way down, you feel a very light resistance before getting to the main spring, which can feel somewhat \"cheap\" but is the intended design.\n\nSpeed is excellent and transfer speed is great. Boot up and ready to go in approximately 20 seconds, which is plenty fast for me. A little heavy but it is a spec laptop and designed for performance. The quietest performance laptop I have ever had. Nice and cool when running. For the price, this is an excellent buy."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "All i can say is wow!! Dell really thought of everything! Excellent cooling although it can get very loud when gaming but who cares, while the fans are always off when doing normal work so you don't hear any noise*(follow the star at the end), performance is out of the roof, tried many games and they run full res, with almost full details very smoothly; built in SSD is not top of the line but still waaay better than any HDD, so if you are a performance enthusiast, you can leave the built in since it is an m. 2 sata (it is a sandisk z400s) SSD and add a top performance SSD like the hyperX savage or the samsung 850 evo and move the OS to it; also i recommend to add a 8GB Ram module for a total of 16GB so they run in dual channel mode. The screen has excellent viewing angles and very nice colors.\n\nThe rason i gave it a 4 star rating is the following: remember that * i put after noise, yeah well when the fans are silent, you can hear a noise as if a hard disk is reading and writing inside the laptop but there is no hard disk, turns out this is an audio related issue where the speakers keep producing this noise. But you will get over it, it was not a deal breaker for me.\n\nI would recommend this laptop for any gamer."}

I'm not wild about the keyboard but you adjust to it after a while. It's thin, light. doesn't get too hot. It rocks. It also has an extra slot for a slim HDD to install as it's d: drive. I purchased a 1TB drive and installed it. Now all my music, movies, and apps and games that don't need the faster Solid state drive performance are installed there. In short, I love this system."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "I'll begin with a review up to day five, that is today, June 5th.\nI did NOT heed the warnings in the reviews. I have yet to regret it! It strikes me very badly, that there are so many difficulties, and reviews still give four stars, and YET only 55% reviews are 5 stars. I'm scared, as although I've only just experienced any issues, I have been told my fortune, and this computer will likely flop on me.\nAnyhow, ive tinkered with dozens of computers. I build them, sell them, repair them. I've taken networking courses, and I consider myself rather savvy, but never aspired to certify. Computers are gross, I think.\nSo, I didn't want to deal with tower computing anymore, and went mobile. I'm going back to school, and needed something reliable- hence my scare that I took this gamble. READ THE REVIEWS. I didn't, and it might just haunt me.\nI spent two weeks looking around online for a new lappy. Naturally going on Newegg, TigerDirect, etc. But one on AMAZON caught my eye. It was this one, the Dell Inspiron 15 7000 series, whatever model this one I'm reviewing is. Then I spent another week meditating and sleeping over my splurge. It's still 800 monies, and that's a lot for an average risk taker like myself :I\nDay one was really exciting. Nervous me, carefully unpacking the hastily boxed computer Amazon just sent me. No damage, this time. (Amazon is always spot on.) I bought this new, and oh boy was it new! Every detail on this computer is crisp and careful. All but one sticker,  which was askew. That's been the worst issue, until now, and you'll agree, that's minor. This computer boots in seconds! 4.7, overall, to be exact. SSD is great, but you should know that already. The screen is very high resolution, but that isn't complimented by the cheap generic monitor. No big deal, it's only a laptop, right? I severely underestimated mobile capabilities! This computer is blazing quick! I constantly check the computer's temperature, because I expect it to melt. It's cold. Always cold. It's unusual, and I'm concerned, because even when I push it for hours non-stop playing Steam games like Skyrim on \"ultra-high\" and it's still cool enough to keep on my lap, I'm sure something's wrong. I can also play new gen games at above medium graphics, which many report to be impossible. The computer came with almost zero bloatware. It asked you to install McAfee, and came with Microsoft office pre-installed, which blows me away, it took 10 minutes to straighten out, carefully. I wanted to treat this new, very impressive, baby of mine. I put Chrome on, I'd never use an Internet Explorer browser, and recommend anyone switch, for safety purposes. Chrome had to be uninstalled, and reinstalled immediately, due to issues not like any I found online. But now it runs great, so I didn't think about it long. I was focused on personalization, then. And getting stupid Cortana to mind her own business, which is an impossible task, was priority. I turned her off, removed the programs, yet she is still always on my task list, hogging memory. Eff. Alas, there's plenty to spare, and I won't risk deleting process files yet, until I'm comfortable and backed up. Day two was crazy. I expected to be confronted with the usual barriers and general hassles of PC gaming. But my network was perfectly connected. I downloaded a 7 GB application in 9 minutes flat- On the nose, and quickest download I've ever gotten in my small town. I was gaming in no time, expecting to spend days figuring the details, but going before I got dinner figured out. So skipping dinner, I took my new light box on a joy ride! I felt like a child, enchanted by beautiful graphics and 60 fps. I swear, you can not expect that from this, I must be lucky. Day two went into day three, I'm sleep deprived, but still, I'm overjoyed by it's performance. I still can't say I'd recommend it, and that stings. Sometimes there are little things that go on in the background that I know is happening, but I can't put my finger on it. Or cursor, if you will. :) I get the sense that although I want so badly this computer to feel stable, I'm fooling myself to look past what might be a bit obvious; this computer just feels cheap.\nIt's gotta be the interface part. Human touch senses it all. The keyboard, although nicely lit, is thin, and doesn't give good tactile sensation. The touchpad is huge and is left and right buttons entirely, so you're always clicking links and ads online, and highlighting words, then maybe accidentally erasing them. The power button doesn't click, and makes me question pushing it again, or pressing harder. The screen feels like it'll crackle and ruin itself. The charging port, although fancy looking cables lead up to it, is overly cheap, and not at all standardized; definitely hinting at future troubles. Things like the USB ports, including the HDMI input/output and even your network ports all feel.. Wrong. I notice if I'm not exact and careful putting my wireless dongle in, it'll likely break. All things included as such, I don't mind. I'll be particularly choosy about how is handled, and it's in good hands. But it's not a kid's computer, or very sturdy for much contact. Maybe not so good for traveling with, or lugging around to school every other day. For day five, I just let it run, and watched it carefully. I finally just now carefully went through the device manager and individually checked for driver updates- found a few important ones needing it. Definitely should've been more thorough, earlier.\nI anticipate, but don't expect, breakdown in a week. I'll be very pleased when this lasts me a year. And that's when I'll edit this review, and give it a full recommend.\nIt took two weeks for Dell to email me! My product is registered! Weird, that one seems. I've had literally no issues with this computer, and I give it my recommendation for sure. For this price, I'd say take the leap! Send it back, if you hate it."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "This computer is a diamond in the rough. It's not the sleekest, but it's a well-bred workhorse that runs Windows without breaking a sweat. I very carefully considered similar 15.6\" notebooks from HP, Lenovo, and ASUS, and also other configurations of the i7559, but this one won the day for me. I would actually suggest getting this configuration over the more expensive i7 and 4K configurations for the following reasons: 1) The i5 is snappy but stays cool - the fans seldom seem to come on and then are barely audible; 2) Battery life is longer with the i5 (I can get 6-9 hours with basic use); 3) unlike the configurations that have glossy 4K touch screens, this model's non-touch HD screen is matte and therefore quite good at shielding reflections and making the screen easy to read even if it isn't 4K (which also saves battery, of course); and 4) this configuration has an SSD that's fast and won't be a bottleneck. Other configs are saddled with slow 5400RPM drives that, I think, defeat the purpose of having a fast processor.  Yes, the SSD is on the small side but if you use the cloud, you can store there, and if not or if you have larger files, it's very easy to expand storage by adding relatively inexpensive m. 2 SSDs (though I haven't done this yet).\n\nMy only complaint about this computer is that, as others have mentioned, the trackpad is mediocre at best. It has a strange \"rattly\" feel to it when you tap on it, which belies the otherwise nice build quality of the computer, and it's not entirely reliable at registering clicks.  It's still usable enough and I'm not too bothered by the flaw since I usually use a mouse anyway. This is probably the best computer I've ever owned, and it's certainly the best value."}

I've had this since January and it's been great for gaming and video editing. Game streaming is fine with Shadowplay, though OBS is very CPU intensive and may not work as desired. With my durability concern, the left hinge area is snapping in and out and won't stay intact. It's also starting to disconnect the speaker housing and back ventilation area the more I try popping the hinge back in place. The right side is still perfectly fine. What puzzled me more is that this has always been in a thick neoprene sleeve in my Jansport backpack when traveling (college student) and has not been dropped at all. I went on the Dell website and have not seen anyone report this issue, nor did anyone make videos on YouTube for it. Maybe I have a defective laptop?

I was especially happy about the look of the laptop. It's boxy from the pictures online, but its stylish when you actually look at it in person.

The 7559 caught my eye because of:\n1 - Skylake i5 quad core (this may be the first time an i5 quad core has been in a laptop format)\n2 - Allowed for a dual drive setup (m. 2 & 2.5\")\n3 - 4GB dedicated video (rare on sub $1K laptops)\n4 - Nontouch 1080p matte screen (great for battery life)\n\nI love the increased real estate over a 13 inch screen; even if the pixel density is lower its more comfortable to work on). The speed is on par with my i5-3540s desktop, and the graphics are close on performance to its R9 270 card. Games play at the same settings as my desktop with frame rates >30.\n\nI love the customization options. I changed out the consumer grade wifi card for a business 7265 without much problem, changed out the single sodimm for 16GB pair of g.skill ripjaws (CAS 9 DDR3L) and added a 1tb 2.5\" HDD.\n\nThe keyboard is a little soft but less flex than on the lower end Inspiron models. Not quite at MacBook Pro level but my typing speed is equivalent. The trackpad is garbage, my only real issue with this laptop. Fortunately I use a mouse so not a big issue, but I feel Dell cut corners with it - a cheap Alps plastic unit.\n\nBattery life is decent for a laptop of this size; I get about 4-5 hours of business use on a charge. The adapter is a 90W and you'll need to take it with you if you want to work a full day on it.\n\nOther than the trackpad, I wish there were a few more ports. A mini DP or thunderbolt 3 port would have been awesome and made this  true 5 star laptop. Unfortunately I can't give this the 4.5 I feel it deserves so I'll up it to 5 to balance out the negative reviews that are more about W10 then the laptop itself.\n\nIn summary, the best sub-$1k gaming laptop currently out there IMHO, even if you add a $120 for additional memory and HDD.\n\nCaveat: I bought directly from Dell; took longer (1 week to ship from local Dell distribution point in Atlanta)."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "I am really enjoying this product. I have run Total War: Warhammer (high), Starcraft 2 (ultra), Overwatch (high), Diablo III (ultra), Heroes of the Storm (ultra), and Pillars of Eternity (high). No problem on any of those games. I know that the 960m won't be able to run games at high settings that come out in the next few years, but it can certainly stand up to most of the games that are out right now. And, for the price, you really can't beat this configuration. Dell did a tremendous job.\n\nI like the styling on the laptop. It has some character but isn't ostentatious like so many gaming laptops (looking at you Alienware). You can use this in an office setting without looking like you are using a child's toy. It has some heft to it, but it's definitely portable. It also stays pretty cool even after hours of use. There is great ventilation.\n\nIt also looks super easy to upgrade. You can open it up with just a single screw and upgrade your RAM or add a HDD for more space. I am loving the SSD that it comes with. Boots up in a flash. Total War is able to load the battles very quickly, which is also a delight.\n\nI'd be happy to answer questions regarding this laptop. I'm very pleased.\n\nThe touch pad is bad, no question there. It doesn't always register clicks correctly, or distinguish between a left or right click. It's pretty miserable. That is probably the weakest part of this laptop. But, as I use a mouse 90% of the time, this isn't an issue."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "I've had this for nearly a week now and so far it has performed terrifically. Plays all the games I've tried on it (Stellaris, Shogun 2, FFXIV, etc.) on high settings no problem. I haven't tried a more recent AAA title yet but I mostly play strategy games and older RPGs so this is the perfect system for playing those on the go without breaking the bank. Computer boots up and runs fast in general. I've also tried running a couple Linux VMs on it simultaneously for when I do programming projects and have had no problems. Definitely glad I got the version with the SSD and not the standard hard drive.\n\nFit and finish is fine. Some people may find it a little heavy and bulky but after using a Mac Book Pro before this and being irrationally terrified of somehow breaking it its nice to have this heavy chunky beast that I'm not as worried about destroying accidentally. I like the rubberized grips over everything. Makes it easier to hold and keeps fingerprints at bay.\n\nOnly complaints are that the screen can see a little dim even at max settings if you're in a really bright area. I knew about this going in after reading reviews of it so I was expecting this. Also Dell has a custom recovery installed on here so even if you choose to do a full reset right after buying in the hopes of clearing out all of Dells extra programs, they'll be right back on there when its finished. Luckily there aren't very many of them installed to begin with. I just tend to like a nice clean install to start out with so it was a bit annoying having to go in and manually uninstall the programs instead. I'm sure most people won't even consider this a problem, I'm just kind of picky like that."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "After playing with this laptop for a few weeks I gotta say i'm very impressed. For the price this laptop delivers solid gaming performance! I feel this laptop is the best in the under $1000 gaming laptop price range due to its nice quad core i5 6th gen processor and the 960m with 4 GB vram! I did a ton of research on ther laptops similar to this ones price and none of them I could find with the 4 gb of vram. Gaming is a blast on this laptop! This laptop will smash older titles like CSGO at over 100fps and Skrim at 60fps both maxed out! Also this thing can play Fallout 4 at 45-60 fps on medium settings and even the new DOOM on medium from 35-45fps! I did play overwatch as well during the beta and it was running it great on medium but I was not able to get what fps at the time, I do feel it was at least 40+ but im not entirely sure. Also the customization is great on this laptop! Just one screw on the back panel and you're in! I just put in a 500gb 7200rpm hdd to store most of my games and it was very easy.  Lastly, the noise under load. You can hear the fans ramp up a bit on more demanding games but I was quite surprised with how quiet they are under heavy load! Just put on a pair of headphones and you won't be able yo hear them! I highly recommend this laptop to someone who wants a gaming laptop for this price point all the way! Excellent work by Dell!"}

I didn't purchase this for gaming, but primarily for photo editing and it has exceeded my expectations.\n\nWhile many photographers prefer using a Mac, I have always used Windows based machines and didn't want to make the transition to a Mac. Using the SSD and the Hybrid makes this a quick and very efficient machine. Average boot time is around 10 seconds, and Adobe Lightroom opens nearly instantly. Even when I export out of Lightroom to other software such as Nik Collection, photoshop or photomatix it is seamless and fast.\n\nThe only concession I would give to a mac over this for photo editing is the Mac has a far superior monitor.\n\nFor under $900 INCLUDING adding a 1tb hybrid drive to this system I have a dream system for my needs...all I can say is wow!"}

Note to self: Don't eat Cheetos's and then touch the cover.\n\nI got this mainly to run my Adobe Creative Suite and to play games like Portal, Doom and Quake. It does everything without a hiccup.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "The seller advertises that the laptop is very good, yet it was anything but good. I'd like to list it in a diary format with the four short days that I have been using this product.\n\nDay 1:\nPackage arrived late, but no problem, it came in at least. I was extremely excited as this was my first high quality gaming laptop. I set it up, transferred some files, and generally had zero problems playing games like Dark Souls 3. Called it a night, and prepared myself to lose myself to laziness and obesity.\n\nDay 2:\nThe laptop was still working fine! Got to play it for hours on end, and customized it even more to match my preferences. It was like a beautiful lady that was willing to do everything for me. And I was ready to commit to this lady for as long as the video game industry doesn't leave me in the dust!\n\nDay 3:\nAnd the beautiful lady had a beautiful body, but her face began to freaking melt. To clarify, the screen essentially bugged the hell out. It flickered very often and would just sometimes show static. I treated this laptop right, I didn't do anything to damage it. It began to become so bad, I had to connect it to a different monitor just to see what I was doing. It was hard to write an email to a professor or talk to my friends when the screen flickers like the TV from \"The Ring\". However, I decided to tough it out. Turned off the computer, put the screen down, and then caledl it a night,\n\nDay 4:\nThe screen flickering only got worse. Instead this time, the screen had to be kept at certain angles so the flickering was kept calm. The unfortunate thing was that the screen had to be pushed way back or I had to just put it out of view so I have the monitor to use. It's like you discovered that the beautiful lady's face had stopped melting below her chin so you had to talk to her with her head flung back. If you wanted to see her face, you needed her to play the worst game of Limbo. At this point, I primarily used my wonderful monitor. But then, I decided to turn off the laptop as I wouldn't be using it for a couple of hours. Then it didn't turn on. The screen didn't turn on. The face of the lady completely melted off. The monitor could not connect as the computer didn't display anything anymore. The laptop was as good as dead, the lady was dead. I had a faceless lady with a beautiful body. I didn't have a responding partner, I had a mannequin.\n\nOverall, I could understand why a used laptop would have some problems. But to label it as \"Very Good,\" is misleading since the one problem I had should have been in a laptop labeled \"Very Bad; Don't Buy\". I wish that more testing would have been done, since I feel like all the seller had done was just hard reset the laptop and considered it good enough. As of now, I thought I could be saving money buying used and trusting what seemed like a good alternative. However, I learned from this experience to only buy new. A new partner will be less likely to disappoint you than a used partner."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "Edit #1: Updated for Doom 4 playtest (as promised) It actually played well! Even at 1920x1080, although it does better at 1600x900.\n\nEdit #2: Titanfall 2 plays nicely on this device at 1920x1080 (installed on the 2nd SSD I put in) - just like with with Doom 4, I turned off Anti-aliasing, anisotropic filtering, occlusion, and blur, but it's really up to you - I'm sure you can still get it to run decently with some combination of these turned on.\n\nReview: The laptop starts in a flash & works as advertised, but oh, lordy. It initially crashed often (& for some reason the Intel display drivers were initially constantly crashing & restarting - but not the OS itself, just the drivers. Windows 10 would report that the drivers had crashed, & keep going), and stuttered due to the bloatware & the default settings. If you have these issues, Update the graphics drivers, & uninstall/remove all the Dell services & products & McAffee (get BitDefender - but be careful with the BD firewall! It'll sometimes block even allowed software!). After I did that, it was stable & fast, but the default graphics processor was still set to the Intel integrated graphics rather than the nvidia processor! So you have to change the default if you plan on playing games regularly & don't want to set the processor for each game you play. Also, even after I removed the Dell software, every few weeks a random command line script whose title starts with \"Dell\" flashes briefly on my screen & disappears.  On top of that, you will want a decent USB hub, as this thing doesn't have too many USB ports. And be sure to set your power profile to high performance if you're worried about games! And either set all your games to run as administrator by default (in the properties window), or create a gaming account with the user/administrator role-switching deactivated - that's a pain (but I keep it on, anyway).  And don't forget setting up the firewall. But, after all that is said & done, it runs games very well for the price (You'll have to turn off all Anti-Aliasing & Anisotropic Filtering & image processing in general for the newer games - that's where the majority of the frames per second go for modern games - this can be done globally through the nvidia configuration tool so you won't have to think about it every time) -  You're definitely not going to get 1080 Doom 4 on ultra detail-(2016-11-11 UPDATE: Well, that's not entirely true - I finally installed an extra chip of 8 GB DDR3L RAM, and an extra 1 TB solid state, and installed the Doom 4 demo on it. I turned off occlusion, depth of field, motion blur, lowered the anti-aliasing and lowered the anisotropic filtering down to triliniear, and then put all the other settings on Ultra, and it's running smooth as butter.  So the moral of the story is do your research! My previous beta playtest of Doom 4 apparently failed because it took up almost all my remaining hard drive space - that sucker is huge, almost 100 GB), but it can play Dark Souls 3 just fine (with the AA & AF off & no processing & with latest graphics drivers to halt the microstutter). Pretty much any of the games out right now, so long as you turn off AA & AF & occlusion. Due to the great differences in performance I noticed in playing Doom 4, I fully recommend installing another SSD in the second drive bay, especially if you play games, & I also recommend getting an external BD/DVD player.  And FYI I unscrewed only ONE screw to release the panel on the back in order to install the new SSD & RAM. I was finished and loading Windows in about 5 minutes.\n\nTL;DR - It's amazing, stable, fast, plays all of the latest games (if you get the space for it and be sure to set the default video card to nVidia) & is easy to maintain, but ONLY if you're prepared to do a lot of the initial configuration."}

Just get it, you won't regret it and if there's an issue just ask for a new one and in 2 days you'll have a replacement. Not worth whining over, not everything can be manufactured perfect everytime. Just handle it like you should handle something that costs this much and you'll be fine. People throwing it in their backpack or holding onto it with one hand while walking around when this thing weighs 9.8 pounds then complaining it broke when the shell is plastic is rediculous, feel like I need to stand up for this laptop for the stupid people who down rate it because of their own carelessness. People need to grow up and live in the real world where you treat your stuff right and don't blame someone else for your mistakes. Sorry to those of you that had issues past warranty that is not your fault, but mine is great and I treat it like I would treat something that cost nearly a thousand dollars...\nFirst laptop they sent me had a black screen that could appear at any time and lock up the computer forcing a hard reset... It could happen within seconds of rebooting or take a couple hours but it would consistently happen. After about the 8th time black screening I contacted amazon for a replacement and they shipped out a new one right away. Really like the new replacement now. Have only tried a couple games but they are running very well. I left the laptop on overnight to see if it would black screen and was still working fine in the morning. Overall I would recommend this laptop, great bang for the buck. We have 5 laptops in this household and one computer and this is the fastest of them all. Mine doesn't seem to have the bleeding issue that others have complained about, just thought I would include that as well."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "I grabbed this as a refurb from Amazon after returning an XPS 13 9350. I really liked the portability of the XPS 13, but it was so buggy as to be unusable. So I decided to give up the portability for a lower price and some more power, and I'm extremely happy with the trade. The 7559 is an amazing laptop that completely lives up to its specs. I've got Win10 and Ubuntu 16.04 loaded on it, and both work without glitches. A single screw is all it takes to remove the bottom cover, revealing an incredibly smartly designed layout with all the parts you'd want to replace/upgrade right in front of you.\n\nThe only downsides are lack of a touchscreen and that the spacebar doesn't always register when I hit it on the right side (which is what I usually do, using my right hand). But I've gotten used to hitting the spacebar a little more firmly, and touchscreen will have to wait until my next laptop.\n\nOtherwise, this thing was a steal at $700. If you're wondering whether Dell actually managed to cram all these specs in at that price, then the answer is yes."}

I opened up the bottom of the computer and noticed the battery cable was not quite connected all the way.  so somehow it dislodged itself.  I fixed that and my problem went away.  So maybe I don't have a bum laptop after all.  upgraded my review to 3 stars, I'll update it again if anything else happens."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "I am writing this from the perspective of a relatively hardcore gamer, and occasional web-surfer, in the Spring of 2016. Expect this to be mostly relevant for the next year or so. Would this computer be better if it had better specs? Obviously. This is for what you're looking at this item for: A budget laptop that can function as a desktop replacement.\n\nI primarily purchased this laptop as a gaming rig. It is not splendid, by any stretch, but it is competent and functional. I purchased mine from the Amazon Warehouse for the discount (I got it for $700), and in that price range (<$1000) it is just about the best machine you could expect. The best point, to me, was that while it only has 8gb of RAM, it can be upgraded, quite easily, to 16gb, to extend its life when that becomes the expected norm.\n\nThe SSD is fast, with not a lot of bloatware. This is my first SSD-only machine, and I fully expect to use the second bay on an HDD as I do a lot of media files and shuffling in the course of my day. But for the moment it services well, even if I'm not saving as many memes or doing a lot of video editing in the interim. Boot time has been, on average, under ten seconds.\n\nGamers: the video card. The 960M is a serviceable, mid-level card.  My library is relatively-current, including games like Heroes of the Storm and Wildstar. These games will perform perfectly fine at a medium-high custom setting. You are sub-$1000, you will not be playing on ultra-intensive settings, so you must accept that. But you can enjoy a pretty crisp gaming experience. Older games such as Civ5 run on max settings without issue. When I first got mine, I did need to run a slight gamma-adjustment (its natural setting was quite dark), but beyond that the display is great.\n\nThe sound card is the only drawback, in my eyes. It can get a little scratched and \"chamber-y\" on headphones. The speakers do have sufficient volume, though, without any feedback that I have yet noticed.\n\nThe casing is plastic, but quite firm, with a quasi-alloy texture to it that doesn't make it feel too cheap. The only \"cheapness\" you'll feel is if you try to bend the screen by the corner, it will give a little, and make it feel delicate.\n\nBattery life is extensive, or at least more than what I expected. While gaming it lasts around 4-5 hours, though very intense games may push that down to 3/3.5.  Heat has not been a noticeable problem, but if you plan to keep it completely stationary, a cooling pad of some sort might be a good investment.\n\nIn all, as a budget gaming laptop this fits perfectly, and will probably have another 4-5 years of solid gaming life in it before you'll notice games becoming unplayable."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "I've owned for about six months at this point and not only don't have a complaint, I couldn't be more pleased with the purchase. I've been using laptops since the days before the touchpad, and this Dell has completely changed how I will view them from now on.\n\nI use it all day every day for work and the always reliable and seemingly instant response to commands adds up to just that much less stress at the end of the day. From startup I can have a dense presentation opened and be editing within 20 seconds. The fact that I can simply close my Outlook/Adobe/whatever productive and in seconds be playing the 30GB+ game I just downloaded from Steam way too fast, on settings that should be way too high, still seems a bit uncanny to me. This is an $800 laptop?\n\nGets through a full work day, usually more, on battery. Good keyboard and back light. Touchpad takes some getting used to but offers simple and functional gesture controls once acclimated (two finger scroll, pinch zoom, etc.). I enjoy every aspect of the design as well. The black and red is not over the top and gives it some character. It's plastic, but it feels very solid, and I have yet to see any scratches or wear and tear. Shows smudges but easily wiped clean with micro fiber.\n\nI've filled the SSD (con: too easy to download and play memory hog games) and will be adding a second SSD soon. By all counts it will be a breeze."}

I love the built quality, materials and understated style. It feels very solid and durable. I used to love Dell, then became disenchanted by a string of poor products, but this one has restored my trust. Only gripe is an issue with the display driver, which has an occasional hiccup and flickers the screen, with a message that it crashed and recovered. (Once it completely crashed the system.) That said, I have not had the problem since a recent BIOS upgrade that was automatically prompted and that I accepted. I am hopeful that it is fixed, and that is why I give 4 stars instead of 3."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "I have finally gotten most of my new laptop set up. Microsoft's tech support has been shockingly helpful in getting my old Office installed, and I've been using it for several days now to play my games (which are of the gentle card-game, HOP, or match-3 variety, not the resource-intense shoot-everything-spatter-blood-everywhere-type games that most people think of when they say \"gaming\").\n\nJust a few cons so far:\n  I don't care much for the graphics in terms of the screen resolution. Even at max resolution, the screen looks fuzzy compared to my old computer. I may have to buy a graphics card if this keeps up, alas!\\\n  It's really big for a 15-inch laptop. And really heavy. Which I'm personally fine with, but not everybody will be thrilled. It's almost as heavy and almost as large as the 17-inch laptop it is replacing, which is kind of shocking.\n  Most of my other issues relate to a few Windows 10 \"features\", like the \"I Will Update When I Feel Like It, No You Cannot Leave The House Or Shut Me Down Right Now, I Don't Care If You Miss Your Flight\" feature, or the \"Cortana wants permission to broadcast the contents of your computer, a complete keystroke log, and your bank account to a group of total strangers at Microsoft, who have crossed their fingers and hoped to die and stuck a needle in their eyes that it will remain safe\" feature. Not Dell's fault, so I cannot ding the computer for it. Plus, I kinda secretly like Windows 10 otherwise, now that I figured out how to ensure Cortana remains firmly wedged under a rock.\n  Oh, I do wish there were more USB ports. I will take up all 3 pretty quickly, and will probably have to buy something that splits them into more. Also on that subject: HDMI-type cables or USB ONLY for your monitor, so this might not hook up to older monitors. That's not a ding, because I think the world is phasing out the big blue monitor plug with the two little blue screw pieces, just a side note.\n\nPros:\n  It's pretty. Sorry, I know that's not exactly a critical feature, but it looks nice anyway.\n  It has a useable NUMBER PAD! This feature makes it worth the size alone, in my opinion. It's only going to get accounting geeks like me excited, but there you are. I didn't even realize that when I bought it, wasn't paying the slightest bit of attention.\n  As and added bonus, the keyboard is actually usable. I had to type on it yesterday, and it went really well, almost as easy and comfortable as my old 17-inch laptop, and nearly as good as a full-size keyboard. I don't have large fingers or anything (and before you start Trumping, I'm a girl person so hush), but I usually find that 15-inch keyboards or smaller are frustrating. This one seems well-designed.\n  It's pretty fast. Now, bear in mind I'm comparing it to a model that I bought in 2012 or something like that, so it might just be the fact that it's a new computer. But it's pretty fast anyway. I opted for the 256 Solid State drive, because I don't need more than that and wanted the speed. Happy I did!\n  It's easy to set up. Really easy, so much that they don't even ship instructions with it. Just a thin piece of paper telling you to plug it in, turn it on, and follow the directions. Which are easy. I was VERY pleased.\n  It is often so quiet it's hard to tell that it is running. This was one of the first things I noticed about the computer, how QUIET it usually is. It does not even hum slightly most of the time. It only makes noise when you force it to work hard, and then it's not as noisy as most I've heard. Impressive.\n  I doesn't seem to get hot; the fan technology has come a long way.\n\nSo in short, I like it and maybe even love it. It has been a good computer so far."}

Used it for about 6 hours of browsing and installations and music playing yesterday before it reached 10%.\nGreat value for money.\n\nCons:\nScreen is a bit glossy so if the screen is black it's not very nice. Horror movies won't be fun. The HD is great however, if you're into watching bright HD movies.\nTrackpad is weird. I blame that on the mouse buttons being part of the touch area, so if you are used to leaving your finger on the mouse buttons you will be annoyed. I'm already getting used to it though, so I'm guessing in a few weeks it'll be fine.\nAudio: at first I really loved it, it has this 3D effect to it, but when I tried to play music I noticed that the audio is not as good as I'd want it to be.\nThe power button is a little clingy, usually need to press it twice to get the laptop to boot up.\nThe keyboard is not anti-ghosting, realized it while playing NFS Most Wanted.\n\nThe cons are all -except for the audio maybe- non essential, the laptop has magnificent performance and I am very satisfied with the purchase.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "Dell basically released a beta product. The specs are great for the price, but you can also tell why it's cheap. Dell really dropped the ball on testing and drivers. The issues were worse upon initial release and have improved with driver and bios updates that have come out, but they're still not all the way there to where this is a trouble free/fluid to use product.\n\nOther complaints:\n-The screen is pretty low quality. It's straining on the eyes and simply not enjoyable to look at.\n-Fans are noisy. It's hard to find a gaming laptop without relatively loud fans, but there is a ton of room for improvement on the 7559.\n\nOverall, the this laptop is still decent for the price. I don't regret buying it, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone either. If someone stole it from me I wouldn't be all that upset and would replace it with something else. Try harder Dell."}

Unfortunately, I fell victim not only to the lack of quality control on Dell's end that frustrates reviewers here, but also the lack of care on Amazon's behalf. I received both my laptops in much larger boxes 'padded' with paper. The laptops weren't even surrounded in it, so they were floating around these giant boxes, susceptible to every movement by the carrier.\n\nOn the laptop's end, my first laptop had a broken sound card. There was a loud hissing coming out of the speakers, even when they were muted. The second laptop's track pad was non-functional, and its network card seemed to have issues as well - networks would disappear and reappear like a rotating door.\n\nIf you can score a functional version of this laptop, it's worth every penny.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "I've had this computer for a couple weeks now.  The previous reviews helped me decide so hopefully this one helps anybody reading it.\n\nLet's go with CON's first. And really they are minimal\n\n1) The touch pad can be a little annoying.  It is not centered like it was in previous Dell Laptops.  Therefore a lot of the times when I am trying to left click I end up right clicking.  I ended up using the Razor mouse I bought with it only. This is a gaming laptop though so more than likely you won't use the touchpad much.  I use it for games and writing reports.\n\n2) There is no NUM LOCK indicator.  On my previous Inspiron there was a light that indicated when NUM LOCK was on.\n\n3) Every once in while I get an error saying there was a graphical error and my applications terminate.  It has happened maybe 3 times since I've had this new laptop.  I'm guessing it's only a driver problem but I wouldn't expect this issue from a new laptop.\n\nPROs:\n\n1) This system boots up extremely fast and operates fast.  My old laptop would literally take 5-10 minutes to get into Windows 7. This new laptop has Windows 10 which is a fast OS even if you have a normal HDD. This laptop has an SSD which adds to the speed.  This computer literally boots faster than my cellphone starts up.  Apps load fast and the games I've played have very short load times.\n\n2) The backlit keyboard is great for night time usage.  I've used some laptops that are backlit and you still can't see the keys.  This laptop allows three levels of backlighting.  Not sure if I'm naming them right but there is soft light, full light, and off.  Even the soft lighting is bright enough at night.\n\n3) Light weight.  The laptop is not too bulky but at the same time is seems durable.  So I don't think it will break the first time I drop it.  Not that I will try that but it does happen.\n\n4) The sound.  Even without earphones the sound on this laptop is incredible.  I believe it has subwoofers which make a slight difference when compared to other laptops.\n\n5) Easy to add a second HD.  Just one screw to remove and replace.  Attaching the second HD took less than 10 minutes.\n\nOverall:\n\n4 out of 5 but if they gave us a choice I would give it 9 out of 10.  Are there better gaming computers?  Yes.  But for this price you won't find a better one.  I recommend it to people who do light gaming like myself.\n\nI moved a 1TB HDD from my previous laptop (which stopped charging) into this one as a backup drive"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "I am very pleased by the performance and appearance of this laptop. I noticed that there are a lot of negative reviews for this product, but most of these people just gave up too easily. I have been able to fix every problem I've encountered (crashes, black screens) with a quick Google search and software tweak. A little work, and this is a great deal. I've actually had more problems from Windows 10 than the computer itself. Thanks to these experiences I've learned a lot more about computers in general. EDIT: After the Windows 10 and Dell bios updates, the system runs smoothly.\n\nPros:\n* Plastic exterior, but durable and well-constructed, with a feel-good matte finish. I love the way it looks with the slanted front and rounded back.\n* Red trim is not excessive, and you feel like you can take it out in public (unlike most gaming laptops).\n* Backlit keyboard is pleasant to use and the keys are nicely spaced to prevent typos.\n* Loud speakers, so you don't strain your ears watching stuff with friends.\n* Quite powerful for the price and uses it well; no lag with multiple programs and games. You can play any older game (Skyrim, Minecraft, Crysis Series) on max graphics, and many new games nearly so. Starcraft 2 is super fast.\n* Very easy to install extra RAM and SSD; a single screw on the back panel is all that's in the way.\n* Battery life is pretty good. When not gaming it lasts for over thirteen hours. Graphics heavy games will drain it in little more than two, but light games can last for four and more.\n* I've used laptops that get so hot I can't touch them, but this stays quite cool.\n\nCons:\n* Poor network card. I've only noticed this during downloads, which are very slow compared to my 2009 netbook. In fact, I downloaded some new games on that netbook and transferred them by flash drive, as this was much quicker. However, web browsing is totally different; very fast, thanks to it's processing power, and it has good reception at far distances.\n* Screen is somewhat dull and unexciting, though this can be helped in the graphics properties. The anti-glare feature helps to make up for this too. The screen does bleed a little bit, but this is only noticeable when it's pitch black, and doesn't interfere with usage.\n* The touchpad is terrible, though this isn't a terrible problem for me, as I rarely use it. EDIT: It works more smoothly after the software update.\n* USB ports are so tight that they scratch the plugs. I guess this helps things from coming out accidentally (a potential disaster for a flash drive), but it's a little overkill.\n* Lacks the common function key to toggle the touchpad, requiring me to unplug my tiny wireless mouse adapter to turn it on (by Win10 settings, it is either on, off, or turns on when no mouse is present).\n* Power cord is a little on the short side for me.\n\nOverall, it's been a lot of fun. I highly recommend it.\n\nEDIT: I've had this laptop for nearly six months now, and I love it more every day. It has the abilities of machines of much higher cost, and somehow avoids the glitches and difficulties my friends have on their rigs. It has seized up in SC2 twice and HotS twice, but I don't know if that is more a problem with the game or the computer. Overall, it's a pleasure to have."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "I've had this laptop for the better part of a weekend. I really got it for developing Android apps as it allows me to upgrade the RAM which is essentially necessary for Android Studio. Though I have decided to keep Windows on it, my primary OS is Linux and most of my review will be about the Linux capabilities of this machine.\n\nFor my Linux Distro, I installed Linux Mint 17.3. At first, I wanted to install the new and beautiful Cinnamon DE but discovered the NVidia drivers aren't suited well out of the box for this machine and Linux compatibility. It is a known bug for the Linux Mint/Cinnamon teams and the fix for it is discussed in another review on here. I essentially walked right through Kris's review on this very laptop for how they were able to install Ubuntu on this machine. My install went very similarly - same issues with needing to adjust the boot script to boot with \"nomodeset\" and then swapping to NVidia drivers once the OS was loaded up.\n\nThe other issue with Linux has been the wireless card support. I will say that it appears Dell/Intel had a little goof-up with wireless connectivity on this card as the card seems to sporadically work and not work when coming out of sleep mode. In my Windows OS, I haven't had any problems after installing the latest Intel Dual Band WiFi driver for the 3165 model directly from the Dell Drivers and Downloads page. Linux does seem to have issues with the wireless card as well, but I think that stemmed from a problem with the old kernel that Linux Mint uses (3.19 or something). I upgraded the kernel to 4.5 and I can't necessarily say that it fixed the problem because I went through a bunch of hoops to get WiFi working on 3.19 kernel, but at the very least it didn't make the driver behave any worse.\n\nAnother important feature of this laptop was battery life for me. On Windows - its outstanding. I'm at 85% right now as I write this and my expected battery life remaining is around 12 hours. This is obviously while under very light usage and I've got the Power Saver feature from Windows 10 on, but it is still very useful and the computer is still performing smoothly. Linux, again, quite another story. With the experience I had with the graphics drivers and the WiFi, I ended up switching from Cinnamon DE to MATE, and now I think I'll be reinstalling again to put on XFCE. The battery life on Linux after a full charge was estimated to be around 5-8 hours, depending on usage. This is stock battery performance with no tweaks to power settings or 3rd party power apps. I have not tweaked the power settings myself much because for my Linux needs, 8 hours would be plenty. However I reckon with the proper tweaking and knowledge the Linux OS should be easily able to deliver 10-12 hours of battery life.\n\nI'll also comment briefly about the gaming performance. For me, I'm an Elder Scrolls guy. So the first games that went on this machine were Elder Scrolls Online and Skyrim. Elder Scrolls Online plays very smoothly on Low to Medium settings, though frames are locked at 30 fps when on battery - probably a good thing, and also probably adjustable as well. Skyrim also played smoothly at 60 fps on Ultra settings with no mods (haven't had time to get much else on yet). The temperatures according to MSI Afterburner for both Skyrim and Elder Scrolls Online stayed right around 60-65 degrees for both the CPU and GPU. I don't have much experience with laptop temperatures during gaming but considering my NVIDIA 970 desktop GPU runs these games at around 60 degrees and my 6th gen i5 6500 runs them around 30 degrees, I'd say those temperatures are pretty good. The fan noise, as many have mentioned already, is extremely quiet.\n\nI'll try to update more as my trials with Linux expands and especially as the new Linux Mint 18 and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS versions are released with updated kernels."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "At first I was quite skeptical of a Dell Insipiron being able to transform itself into a gaming laptop, but, after a few hours, all doubts were cleared.\nIt is fast, reponsive, reasonably light, and  has a great battery life. It can easily and without any effort perform daily tasks such as Microsoft Office or web browsing. The real value comes when you want to play videogames (or watch movies at high quality), and it does not fall short in any way. I can play Bioshock Infinite 1080p Ultra, 60fps, COD Advanced Warfare, most settings on High, 60 fps and The Witcher 3 720p, all utra 40-60fps. The best thing is that overheating is not an issue due to its great ventilating system.\nThere are a few downsides, that are quite trivial for me, but maybe not for other users. The CPU may become a bottleneck for the GPU, providing an unbalanced sensation while performing demanding tasks, (gaming, rendering ...etc), the Mousepad is quite lousy and slow, and it is computer that gets dirty pretty easily due to fingerprints.\nOverall, I LOVE this computer and in terms of price/worth ratio I think is the best option available."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "I am coming from a macbook pro and i am very impressed with this laptop.  This laptop has been awesome so far!  It plays everything on high to ultra.  I love playing war thunder, it will play on max graphics at about 60fps.  I usually play it on high just because i like to have the 40-50 frame buffer for smooth game play.  World of tanks runs great even though it is a more cpu intensive game.  I runs at about 50 fps at high.  Metro last light plays at a constant 70fps at very high.  plays 7 days to die at high with 60 fps.  Never overheats on a flat surface because of the dual fans.  screen looks beautiful with good viewing angles.  track pad is decent and comparable to any macbook pro.  boots up from cold start to desktop in 4 seconds.  I got this laptop for gaming and school work (word processing) and it is perfect for both.  Right now, it's the best you can get for the money, looks sleek, doesn't feel cheap, and performs fantastically.  has room for upgrades.\n\nCons: rarely i will get a message that the drivers have crashed (display) but since updating the drivers on the dell website that hasn't occured again.  Sometimes when copying and pasting by using the right click menu, the menu will be artifacted....which makes me nervous but it only happens for a second and doesnt affect performance at all.  wifi and internet is kinda picky but it will work after a few minutes of playing with it.\n\nAll in all I am very happy with my purchase and as long as it keeps on working I will continue to be happy with it.  I will also report back here if or when this laptop fails and a description as to why it failed."}

There is no reason for spending extra money on that I7 that you can't even fully use the power of it with 960m. i5 is really the way to go on 960m machine that is designed for gaming. i7 is just a bit of wasting money unless gpu is a 970m which is 60to70% faster than 960m."}

It can play the latest games on Medium settings while on a resolution of 1920x1080 while still getting 40-60 FPS. Games that I run include: The Division, Ryse: Son of Rome, Far Cry 4, and GTA V.\n\nThe actual build material feels really solid. Though it is plastic, it still feels like a quality laptop when you handle it. The display is crisp, and the back-lighting for the screen is sufficient. If you can, opt for the 256 GB SSD. It uses an M.2 slot which gives you the liberty of adding a 2.5 SATA HDD in the empty HDD slot. I have the 256 GB SSD in the M.2 slot, and then I added a 512 GB HDD disk. You can also upgrade the RAM, as it does come with 8 GB stock. However, you will need to buy the low voltage ram, (I think 1.35 V, since I tried adding a 1.5 V 8 GB Crucial stick, and it didn't recognize it. )\n\nIt comes pre-loaded with Windows 10, and some standard Dell Software.\n\nThe keyboard takes some getting used to especially since they added a number pad on the right side. But the keys are nice, and they come with three backlight settings which is a really nice touch. The battery has good capacity, and on idle the laptop can last you 7-8 hours. Battery life will take a dip of course if you are running games on it. (maybe 2-3 hours max)\n\nThe trackpad however, could be improved. At best, its decent, and multi-touch does work on it, however its not as responsive as one who may be used to the Apple trackpads, would like.\n\nThe design is pretty simple, but pleasing to the eye. At first glance, you wouldn't recognize it as a Dell. The red accents, including the Dell logo, and speaker grille, as well as the exhaust vents, give it a gaming notebook look.\n\nThe sound on the laptop itself is solid, however it does get a bit tinny at full volume.\n\nThere are 3 USB ports, HDMI output, Ethernet, and SD card slot.\n\nThe charger comes with a glowing blue tip, which helps you see it in the dark, and the power brick itself is not too bulky.\n\nNot only do I recommend this laptop to those who want an affordable platform for mid-level gaming, but also for those who need the extra computing power, and graphics power, in a productivity machine."}

I have yet to play any games due to the computer not being able to produce an image (BF4, FO4) instead, the game will launch and it will be nothing but a black screen -- the sounds are there, and you can control the player and navigate the menus.. but you can't see anything. Tried everything to fix the issue, and i'm still at square 1. PLUS, the intel graphics drivers crash constantly despite updating them to the latest driver when once comes out. Very disappointing, since I returned the first one hoping that the problems would be fixed with the replacement.  Definitely wished I bought a better laptop, or a cheaper one because all I do on it is school work and browsing the web."}

I got the i5 version with a 256GB SSD (SanDisk for those interested), 4GB Nvidia GTX 960M, with 8GB RAM (bought an additional 8GB with purchase). So far, I have tested GTA 5, Witcher 3, Metro Last Night, Tomb Raider (2013), Skyrim, and Cities:Skylines. Coming from a machine with *shudder* AMD Radeon R2 Graphics I have forgotten what playing a game actually feels or looks like. After letting the Nvidia control panel \"optimize\" all of my games, each of the aforementioned were able to maintain 45-60fps on mostly high and very high settings. While playing on my lap, it got warm but not hot with the exception of GTA 5 which was using a mix of high and very high settings...reducing to a mix of normal and high brought the heat down considerably. While the screen is great and better than most I wish the brightness would go up another 10-20%, You will not be disappointed with the same specs I have."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "I got the laptop today and so far it's pretty amazing. It took all of about half an hour to get setup and up and running. I updated the drivers for the built in Intel video card and the Nvidia card right away for good measure. After uninstalling Mcafee the laptop was ready to go. I haven't had a chance to test it with any real games yet, but for everything else it's blazing fast. From completely turned off to on my desktop it takes about 8 seconds. If it's in hibernate mode and I open it up it takes about 1 second to get to my desktop. Also so far the battery life is phenomenal. I configured it around 4:45 this afternoon and messed around on it until 6 or so and the battery dropped to 90%. I closed the lid and went to dinner and came back a couple hours later and it was at 89%. Since using it the last few hours it's only dropped to 71%. Granted that's not doing any gaming or anything to intense, it's still great battery life overall. At this point there's nothing to complain about with this laptop. The screen is plenty bright, and I didn't notice any screen bleed like in some of the negative comments. I actually think the keyboard and trackpad work pretty well, not as good as a traditional mouse and keyboard, but much better than most people were leaving in reviews. Overall I couldn't recommend this laptop more to anyone looking for a moderately priced laptop that can get a lot of things done."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "I have owned this laptop for about a month now and I will post a follow up at about a half year.\n\nPros:\n- Great Price. Can't beat the price on this laptop for what you get. Very decent graphics card that plays new games like The Division on low and older games on med/high\n\n- SSD. Can never go wrong with an SSD. I have all my games installed on here that I need faster load times or higher data stream rates. I installed a 1tb HD for files and other none essential storage.\n\n- Fan Noise. It gets decently loud when working at full speed trying to cool your graphics card, but it's nowhere near the sound of the old Dell I used to use.\n\n- Matte Finish. Kind of a personal thing but I love matte finish on laptops. Looks so much cleaner than gloss.\n\nCons:\n- Wireless card. Very strange when a newer released laptop has a sub par wireless card. This thing gets 6 MB/s under my hardwired desktop and 5 MB/s under what my cell phone gets at an equal range. Kind of disappointing as the laptop main function for me is to use it for some couch gaming.\n\n- Mouse Pad. Very shoddy mouse pad, but like every other gamer out there I use an external mouse so it's not a huge issue. Can get a little annoying if I try to play some turn based games with my mouse pad.\n\nOverall:\nGiving it a 4 star review based mainly on the value of the laptop for the price. It is not a high end gaming machine and if you are considering buying this for that purpose than think again. You'll probably have to dip quite a bit further into your wallet for something like that. For my purpose, I love this thing and I'm glad I bought it. It's a bit of a shame about the wireless card, but if you have a high enough base internet speed it probably won't be noticable."}

All of the drivers that I tested (sound, video, mouse, etc.) are up to date, so that no longer seems to be an issue.\n\nI ran into one minor issue with the built-in mic.  You need to set it up before it works. You can't just jump into Discord, Mumble, or whatever out of the box.  There also seemed to be limited info on how to set it up.  I expected it to be more obvious, coming from a Win7 machine.  You need to go to Control Panel -> Sound -> Recording.  Pick the Microphone, right click on it, and select Configure Speech Recognition. Pick Set Up Microphone, then Other at the bottom of the next window.  Hit next a couple of times, read most of the prompt, and click next again to finish.

I did have a few of those problems myself and if you get this you will probably have some similar issues getting it set up perfectly however if you are willing to spend the time and the google searches to overcome those minor issues this laptop is an incredible machine for the price. The processor and the SSD create an incredibly efficient machine when it comes to almost any task and the graphics card has handled every game I've thrown at it in beautiful high settings better than either console.(I swear I'm not a pc gaming elitist I just feel it is important to note if you are a new PC gamer to note that this will be on par or better than those consoles at most of the same games)\n\nIf you are getting this for PC specific games such as MOBA's most of those are relatively simple to run and this played Heroes of the Storm and League of Legends on max settings at 60 frames no problem. As for MMO's I haven't actually tried any of those yet but my desktop handles those fairly well and this laptop is more powerful than it so it should be no problem.\n\nBasically if you are wiling to deal with some minor nuisances you really can't find another machine as good as this for under 1000. Really the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because someone not really tech savvy might struggle with it and I'm surprised they haven't updated or fixed some of these minor issues."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "This is by no means the highest level gaming laptop you can get, nor even in that tier. However, for a fraction of the cost of those big boys you actually get a highly capable and highly portable machine. After all, what good is a laptop if it weighs a ton and doesn't fit in a bacpack (or you wouldn't want to carry it around in a backpack due to weight). By basic laptop standards, the i7559 is by now means compact, but travelling with it is doable. It is also a snap to expand the RAM and drop in an additional hard drive. So for like a little over $100 more, I know have a full 16GB RAM and an additional 500GB storage space. More than enough to keep most of my games, and all of my photos and Adobe Lightroom installed.\nI primarily got this for long trips so I'd have access to games and be able to edit some vacation photos on the fly. The one problem with the latter, and the only reason I dropped to four stars, is because the screen's color representation is...sub-par. One of my two primary reasons for getting this laptop is hindered seriously by my distrust in the color accuracy. The more I use it, the more I know what to expect in terms of difference in how photos look on this screen vs. most others, but I still always check on another (even my phone is a good litmus test) before calling it done. Most people probably wouldn't be that picky though.\nAs for games, I am not playing the absolute latest cutting edge games on ultra settings, but I can play games like Far Cry 4 and Wolfenstein New Order on high settings with no lag nor any problems whatsoever and still get decent frame rates. The laptop remains whisper quiet most of the time, partially due to SSD, but even when the fan kicks in it is relatively quiet compared to most.  I thought I would hate Windows 10 but it's growing on me and doesn't seem to be as buggy as other windows versions were at this stage in their life cycles. Maybe Microsoft is figuring this development stuff out after....what, 30 yrs?\nThere is some, but not a lot, of Dell bloatware. No big deal really. The few times I had to call Dell support they were on the line quickly and were helpful.  Most of he minor issues I've had stem from the rest of the world catching up with Win 10. No hardware issues or serious software issues. I've been using this for 3 months now and seems to be a rock-solid performer, and an unbeatable deal. I think Dell has created a new genre here: a low-frills yet very capable gaming laptop for the 90% of us who don't need the extra edge of something like an ASUS ROG, and who aren't willing to pay an additional major chunk of cash to achieve that disproportionately-priced edge. If that sounds like a good tradeoff to you, I  highly recommend this laptop"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "Pros: For the price, this laptop is absolutely outstanding. From experience, it can handle most current gen games (Fallout 4, Witcher 3, Just Cause 3, GTA 5) at medium-high settings, running at full 1080p resolution, while providing a relatively consistent 40-45 FPS. Using Windows 10 is a pleasure, and the snappy interface is the perfect complement to the outstandingly fast 6th generation Quad-Core Intel Core i5, especially when paired with the thoroughly speedy 8GB of RAM and 256GB M.2 solid state drive. Apps open quickly, nothing ever lags (even with several resource-hogging applications going simultaneously), and best of all, there is an empty SATA bay inside (with cable included!), perfectly poised to accept any 2.5\" secondary storage drive that you can throw at it. Add that with the additional empty RAM slot, outstanding battery life (5-7 hours on a single charge) and wonderfully effective cooling system, and you have yourself one of the best budget gaming/performance laptops that money can buy.\n\nAs you might have inferred from my glowing list of pros, this laptop, as it happens, has very few significant drawbacks, but nonetheless:\n\nCons: Although the matte display has outstanding viewing angles and fairly accurate color representation, I do often find myself wishing that it were just a bit brighter. I'd say it feels close to using a laptop with a \"normal\" brightness range at around 7.5-8/10 (brightness level). Also, the plastic grills covering the two rear heatsink vents are rather brittle, and I have already managed to inadvertently snap two off (partly my fault, as I was careless with putting it into my ragged-zipper bookbag). The keyboard on the machine is pretty decent, and the presses have pretty good travel and tactility, but the touchpad on the thing is absolutely atrocious. Honestly, I have never encountered a touch-based input device that is as utterly frustrating and uncomfortable to use as this one. I would say, at its best, it is decently usable, and at its worst, I'd rather be using a damn tracking stick.\n\nFinal notes: Some reviews seem to take an unfairly negative stance towards the quality and tonal depth of the audio system. From my usage, it is very satisfactory; it gets quite loud, is not tinny, and is apt at pushing the lower ranges. Also, the webcam is amazing (as far as webcams go). Best I've ever seen on a laptop, save for a Macbook Pro.\n\nVerdict: If you're considering the purchase of this laptop, I highly recommend that you do."}

The GPU has disconnected itself and is no longer detected or usable.\n\nInitial review:\n\nThe hardware works as expected. There is minimal bloatware, which is a huge plus.\n\nThe build quality is very iffy. Most of the frame and monitor frame are snap-together clamshell plastic.

Changing the angle on the monitor applies a lot of force on the body and causes the two parts to split apart, both on the monitor half and the keyboard/computer half.\n\nAfter a while, they won't snap together neatly and there will be a loose separation between the top and bottom half of the computer, particularly by the charger port."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "I will start off by saying I shopped around for a long time looking for a laptop to replace my 5 year old Toshiba Portege. My primary requirements were a solid state drive, a mid-upper range processor and a dedicated video card. Most of what I found fitting that profile was over 1000 dollars. I finally stumbled across this laptop on Amazon and decided it fit my needs and then some.\n\nLook and Feel:\nThe laptop looks and feels great. It has a matte finish with a nice grip on it. It is heavier than my portege was but I knew that would be the case. I am a little worried about stuff getting into the heat sink fins on the outside of the laptop since they are partially exposed. Power cord is bulky like all of dells, but this allows a faster charge.\n\nComputing;\nProcessor handles both MATLAB and AutoCAD without much difficulty, SSD loads windows quickly and comes out of standby without hesitation. I have not had the pleasure of any large file transfers but on small ones it is very quick. Moving files from my USB 3.0 external portable drive was faster than any other PC I have used it on. I installed an old laptop drive in the spare 2.5\" hard drive bay and it doesn't seem to slow down.\n\nDisplay:\nI was very skeptical of the IPS screen on this laptop, but now that I have it in my hand I can definitely see the difference. I am not a video editor, but I can see and understand the desirability of the IPS monitor. The video card handles Inventor very well, I cannot attest to high end graphics programs though. Watching a streamed movie is absolutely no issue for this laptop. My only concern is the only external video is HDMI and no Display Port.\n\nBattery:\nWith the screen at home, I only need 25% brightness to see it well, so the battery life exceeds the specs that are shown on Dell's website.

I do not believe you will find a laptop with these specs below 800.00 which makes this a great value for any budget gamer on the road (im currently writing this review while in a hotel on business trip :). with a full quad core (not dual core with hypertherading like most companies try to push off as \"gaming laptops\" nowadays) and a GTX 960M, you will be able to handle most all games on high settings with ease\n\n2.) light up keys, nothing fancy but again at this price point, fantastic value\n\n3. I love the red accents on the case, it gives abit of flare.\n\n4) battery life is good thanks to the optimus switching between the the GTX 960M and thed on-board intel 530 chipset, on battery you can get around 4 to 6 hours of casual use and about 2 hours gaming on battery (note the performance will not be as great on the Intel onboard but is about equal to the old GT 8800 series cards. you can enable the GTX 960M on battery but do not expect great battery life if you do.\n\nThe bad:\n\n1) because of the price point, the case does feel abit cheap, but not as bad as other products i have used, i keep feeling like im gonna break it but that could be me being over cautious due to this being a 800.00 laptop.\n\n2: No disk drive? not really a con giving today's standards''\n\n3: im abit cautious about the speakers, i heard some static come from them in the morning from time to time but not often, I will be watching this\n\nAll in all this is a great product that I feel anyone who buys it will get their money worth from it."}

I am A+ certified... and sadly Dell certified.  Don't buy this computer what ever you do. Sound issues, Graphics driver issues, Ships with Single channel memory requiring an upgrade to get performance.  Advertised with wrong specs.  Certainly these issues play into the fact this only has a 55% 5 star (sad for amazon).  But it is the touch-pad that makes it completely unusable.\n\nI give up, I can't even type. I give up with 3 or more errant clicks. It would be one thing if I was brushing on the touch-pad, but my hands are nearly a half inch above it and it still registered errant clicks.

They said I might want to try Best Buy.\n\nUPDATE: 12/20/2016 - Just had one of the hinges break under normal use. Not looking forward to the return process. Besides the weak hinge design, I've enjoyed the computer! Certainly not the build quality of a macbook but also not the price.\n\nI'm a notebook power user and am accustom to the build quality of a macbook pro, yes a bit of notebook snob - hey I have my standards!  However, my son needed a notebook and I didn't need another mortgage payment, so after lots of searching this is the notebook that I decided to buy for him.  He loves to game but also is a serious student.  I added 8 GB of RAM and added a 480 GB drive to the empty bad after removing just one screw on the back of the notebook.  This is the only notebook computer that I could imagine talking my mother through doing the upgrade, let's just say it is CRAZY EASY to do RAM & SSD addition.\nLinks to what I bought are below:\nRAM:\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CQ35HBQ?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00\n\n480 GB SSD:\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00M8ABFX6?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00\n\nThe keyboard has a nice feel and the backlight is reserved for premium notebooks but much appreciated for the price.  The keyboard layout is fine for my son and me.  Normal use of this notebook is very cool (thanks to the 6th generation intel smaller die processor that uses less battery).  The i5 processor is more than fast enough for just about anything you'd throw at it!  When playing games computer will heat up but not enough to cause burns or melt through plastic table cloths. The 15.6 inch screen is good, just the right size and the 1080p resolution is well balanced for the size screen.\n\nWARNING:  Do not think this is an i7 chipset as the model number has \"i7\" in it but it is really an i5.  Funny thing is the 6th generation i5 (latest tech from intel) is MORE THAN powerful enough for nearly all users.\n\nMy second warning is to be prepared to be so impressed with this notebook that a few months later you will order another one of these to replace your wife's 5 year old shuttle computer.  Good news is my wife is now all smiles as she's never had such a fast computer before...  There are worse things than a happy son and wife..."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "When it comes to gaming, I normally wouldn't buy anything from Dell because, well, it's Dell. However, I was in need of a replacement laptop and someone recommended me this. I was a bit hesitant at first, but decided to give it a shot anyway because the value was better than the other option I was looking at. Lo and behold, I was surprised by how well it performed when it finally arrived at my door!\n\nWhile I haven't tested every game in my library, I decided to throw Fallout 4 at it just because I already loaded Steam and it was my second benchmarking game behind Witcher 3, and didn't feel like redownloading Witcher 3 through GOG. I was initially worried at first because the FO4 launcher auto configured to Low settings, but I decided to push the envelope and set everything to Ultra anyway, minus God Rays. While it's no 60fps, I was still averaging between 30-40fps or so when I wasn't in terrible loading zones like the Goodneighbor area (haven't actually been there yet now that I think about it). For $810, you can't really get a better deal on a gaming laptop with similar specs.\n\nNot sure what is causing this, but my only real complaint with this laptop is that the text in certain programs and even the web are pretty inconsistent with the rest of my computer. I mean, sometimes letters are clear to read, sometimes it's a little blurry in one program or another, and then there are sites where the text is just outright bolded. At first I thought maybe it was the website I'm viewing, but switching between my desktop and laptop (both are running Windows 10), I can definitely say it's an issue with the laptop, as my desktop shows that text clarity is the same across all the websites and programs that I had on my laptop. I've also tried enabling Clear Text as well, but that doesn't remedy the issue unfortunately.\n\nOverall though, this laptop is pretty solid and I'm satisfied with what I paid for. Now if only I can somehow fix the text clarity issue...\n\nUPDATE: I have recently discovered that the text issue was a result of Windows 10 auto-adjusting text size to 125% in the Display settings. If you change it back to 100%, this will make all the text more consistent and not blurry/bolded."}

The 3 things I'm more impressed with about this laptop are it's weight (I love how light this thing is), it's battery time (played Starcraft 2 at max settings for at least 2 and 1/2 hours before battery died), and finally it's keyboard (great travel on the keys and just enough click).\n\nThe only real minor issue I have with the laptop is it's touch pad.  It's a bit annoying to click on things and have it register when you're pressing down on it.  But, since I'm using a wireless MX mouse 99% of the time I just don't think this warrants a huge knock in it's overall rating.\n\nOne of the most impressive things about this laptop is how well it does with just about every program/game I have.  Everything runs fast and snappy and I'm playing most/all games on max settings with great frame rates.  Granted I do have to turn down SOME things in Battlefront but that's to be expected for a AAA state-of-the-art game that max's out desktop's 5x as powerful as this laptop.

The plastic case is a bit flimsy feeling, but you can't expect a premium feel for this price.  The hardware is what you're pay for and it's what you're getting.  Great CPU, nice crisp display, upper mid range graphics card.  Just grab another 8GB of memory for $30, and perhaps another SSD/HDD for more storage and you've got pretty much the same thing as a high end machine at half the price.  Upgrading this machine is pure Joy.  Just remove 1 screw and the SDD/RAM is easily accessible.  You don't have to take half the machine apart just to put in some memory.  Awesome.\n\nI like that this machine is stylish without being childish. (opting out of crazy colors and over-the-top design)  Yes, i'm a gamer.  But i'm also an adult.  I need a gaming/business hybrid and this computer hits that mark.  I also like the keyboard.  It's good for typing and keys are responsive.

The touchpad takes some getting used to, and I'm not a huge fan, although I do like the iPad-esque scrolling.\n\nMy unit became defective after one day of gentle use.  I opened the screen up after I had spent 12 hours installing apps and playing with it and found that the bottom two-thirds were covered in dark-grey lines.  Upon restarting, it was a singular green line running across the top of this display anomaly.  I attempted trouble-shooting aimed at the display drivers, but I could not fix the issue.

It still runs impressively fast, and I have not had many issues with it. However, I'd like to add a few shortcomings I've noticed as time went on.\n\n- The \"bleeding\" effect of the backlight mentioned in some reviews has become more apparent to me, especially in dimly lit settings. While I don't find this particularly perturbing, I felt it was worth mentioning for those who would be bothered by it.\n- The laptop, while easy to disassemble, and add additional hardware to the interior, has become a bit.. easy to come apart. On the left side of the case of the laptop, near the folding latch that connects to the screen, the plastic interlocking pieces has seem to come apart in a non repairable manner. This is particularly a problem if you accidentally spill something nearby or face humid conditions in your workspace. Needless to say, the quality of the plastic encasement itself isn't built to last. Or perhaps, it was a special case for me, but I digress; this is something you should consider before buying this laptop.\n- The charger cord becomes easily frayed near the connection to the charging port on the laptop. It hasn't ceased functioning, but it has brought about concerns that it may need to be replaced by a sturdier charging cable in the future.\n- The backlit keyboard is a godsend, and the chiclet-style keys feel very nice on your fingers, even during long gaming sessions. However, I've come to notice that the spacebar easily wears out, as mentioned in other reviews, which often leaves me going back to add a space into what I type. Pressing the space bar in the middle seems to circumvent this issue, but it is a minor annoyance all the same, yet again, referring to the cheaper build quality.\n\nI also should add, that I am very aware and careful of caring for my technology, and do everything in my power to ensure its longevity. That being said, I noticed these issues popping up in the first few months, regardless of the careful measures I've taken. For a (at the time) 650 dollar laptop, it is still definitely worth the price at even 750, in my opinion, but I want to spread this information to help those on the fence and seeking feedback on this product. I still highly recommend it for its hardware specs and its overall performance, design, and appearance. The only lacking factor appears to be the material quality/durability."}

So I was pretty happy I took the chance. This is my first used purchase from Amazon.\n\nBut I think I know why my unit was returned. I noticed it as soon as windows loaded up. The colors on the display are terrible. This has to be the worst display I've seen out of the box. White was pee-yellow, and the colors were horrible and washed out. Fortunately, I worked as a tech when I was in college. After re-calibrating and creating a custom profile for each color channel with Intel's controls, I have a fantastic gaming laptop with a gorgeous display.\n\nOther fixes I've made have just been tweaks to power options and installing new drivers. I highly recommend going to Dell's website and updating your Bios right away. It'll fix the popping sound from the speakers and the scary blank flashing screen when the computer wakes from sleep. The other drivers I updated through device manager and I haven't had any more problems.\n\nUsed or new, this computer is a fantastic deal. If you're comfortable solving software issues, I recommend this purchase. I would have loved a rainbow colored keyboard, but the extra $400 doesn't really seem worth it. This computer is FAST. And easily upgradable. I think I'm going to be very happy with this for the next 2 or 3 years when I replace it with a desktop.

First off I would like to say to anybody who may be have any doubts about purchasing this computer, do not. I understand there are some negative reviews but, I believe these were individual circumstances not the product as a whole. I purchased this laptop from the Amazon warehouse with the description of the individual packaging as damaged only. When it was shipped I was very much surprised that this computer was brand new with no blemishes or damage. I saved so much money with the purchase from Amazon warehouse and still having the Dell one year warranty as well.\nThe components that are included within this laptop for this price is nearly unheard of. The screen is a 1080 resolution with a matte finish and is absolutely beautiful when watching movies, gaming, or just surfing the web. The boot up time from start up is about 9-10 seconds and is all because of the SSD included. The track pad in my opinion is very responsive though I understand this has been a grievance with others. The audio is crisp and clear but, the subwoofer is pretty much irrelevant as base is pretty much nonexistent. A decent pair of external speakers will remedy this problem lol. The i7559 does come with Dell audio Max which pairs nicely with the external speakers for quality sound. The laptop is also nicely upgradable with just one screw removed from the back panel. You can upgrade your Ram and there is another bay open for another hard drive as well.\nOne thing I will suggest is that when you do get this computer upgrade all your drivers manually as this will solve a lot of little bugs you may encounter. I would first upgrade your Wifi drivers and the RealTEK audio as well. This will prevent any audio popping from your speakers that has been reported in other reviews. Another issue I would like to comment about is the dreaded Intel HD driver windows 8 has failed and recovered. I contacted dell technical support about this issue and pretty much stated I need to purchase a 263 dollar software 1 year warranty to fix this issue. I was not very pleased that this being a new laptop and all they want is to sell you more stuff. Well after much research this is a very common problem many people have incurred with many other brands of laptops with windows 10. The problem is a direct conflict between Intel and Windows 10. The Intel HD 530 needs to be upgraded to 20.19.15.4380 series driver as this includes a mutch needed patch to help resolve this issue. I will suggest to download the Intel driver utility and manually install the update as Windows 10 will not update the driver to the most recent.\nOne issue I do have is the infamous finger print smudges. What I did was purchase some skins and a keyboard cover and the issue is pretty much resolved lol. The laptop is exceptional and for anyone just wanting to game to general internet surfing will love it as well. Oh yes and for the Dedicated 960GTX and I5 6th generation skylake, I have thrown just about every game I play on ultra at this laptop and never has a hiccup. One final feature I will comment on is the excellent cooling this laptop has as well. So all in all purchase and enjoy."}

The laptop is clean, I use it while I travel and it presents like a business laptop. It's the subtle accents of red that hint at the hardware inside. The things a beast in a small package. I can play my few games I use including Cites Skylines (which is a demanding game) and Minecraft with over 124 FPS! It also renders in my 3D modeling software Solidworks with no issues. The battery life on this thing is also a feat, I can get a solid 4 hours out of it with light gaming and surfing the web. The screen is more than bright enough and crystal clear. I've heard the grips about the screen bleeding light which mine appears to have some of but honestly I only notice it when it's starting up. Speaking of start up, under 10 seconds and she's booted up, it's insane!\n\nMy only grip is the audio, it's a tad muffled like the trebled turned down and there is a small vibrations when I watch some YouTube videos with people speaking. Otherwise I'm glad I purchased this machine!"}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "A good high-performance laptop for the budget minded, but not without some annoying quirks.\n\nI paired it with an additional 8GB ram stick, to bring it up to 16GB. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CQ35HBQ\nCPU-Z Does not report the memory operating at 1600MHz though, which could be either 1) a limitation on the motherboard in a 2 SODIMM configuration, 2) I messed up and got the wrong RAM, or 3) CPU-Z isn't right or not accounting for power saving. The BIOS claims the RAM is 1600MHz, so who knows. Not really important, except if you're a technophile I guess.\n\nIt's light, and has great battery life, but the battery is not removable without unscrewing some things. The \"skin\" on it is pretty nice too.\n\nThe touchpad is OK. Two finger scrolling, awesome, pinch zooming, and other expected gestures work, however--and this might be a Windows 10 Driver thing--I could not configure 2-finger-tap for middle click. I tried generic drivers from all the major touchpad manufacturers and nothing works. There is no indication *who* made the touchpad.\n\nThe nVidia graphics card in this laptop sort of switches with the integrated Intel graphics when you're not doing things that demand the performance (and power cost) of the GPU. This is especially annoying because it means your hardware accelerated browser or any sort of H.264 playback is still processed through the questionable Intel graphics chip. Similarly terrible, the graphics drivers from Intel direct are not compatible! DELL is responsible for customizing and re-packaging the Intel graphics drivers, so... a year from now good luck trying to get any updates for that. That being said, I haven't actually tried to do any sort of full screen gaming on this. I just wanted a cheap, well rounded laptop with headroom, and that's what I got.\n\nI got some BSODs when using Adobe CS5.5 applications (Premiere, Audition, Photoshop), which mostly went away after getting updates from Adobe, but the system still crashes occasionally when browsing. I think this is being caused by the Flash player plugin. Each time it initializes the sound card, I hear a \"pop\" or \"click\" through the speakers, which just sounds really really bad. (Though, I've seen similar behavior in a Lenovo work laptop. I think non-soundblaster soundcard quality has just gone down the toilet in the last 5 years).\n\nAccessing the upgradable/removable components is super easy. One screw, and a giant panel on the bottom comes off and gives you access to everything you can customize. Very nice touch, DELL. What I especially appreciated was the 256GB SSD was actually in the M.2 port, so there is a free 2.5\" SATA connector and slot, if I ever need to put another storage device in.\n\nThe case itself is all plastic; but I'm OK with that. It will flex a bit when you handle it, but the design is good and exhausts heat mostly out the back, making it OK for your lap, heat-wise.\n\nAs for the headline, this is a pretty solid laptop if you're not looking for ultra cutting edge and high quality everything. It's glitchy, but reliable. And about half the cost of an equally-marketed laptop from 6 years ago. I'd recommend this assuming you're fine with the things I've listed here."}

The big name being an Alienware M18Rx2 and this laptop has really made me wish I never spent that much on that Alienware laptop because this laptop runs just as good and it's a good 15 lbs lighter. The screen is a bit smaller 15inches down from 18.2 inches but the images on the games I play are fantastic and run really amazing. Some games I have played at high settings with no issue is ARK, Witcher 3, World of Warcraft, Xcom 1, Rocket League, Civ V, and Final Fantasy Realm Reborn just to list a few.\n\nThe only downside I could think of is memory but I just went and bought another one to install since in this laptop you get an extra spot and problem solved.\n\nI have read a lot of reviews about the keyboard not being good. Honestly though for it being $800.00 it's not bad. Are they the best quality no but I have not had any issue with it and I actually like the feel of the keys. The other complaint I read a lot of was the bleeding from the bottom of the screen. The only time I see that honestly is when I move the screen up and down which is very rarely. Other than that no issue with the bleeding.\n\nThis has been a really nice purchase and probably one of the best I have made in my life. I really did not want to buy this laptop because Dell has screwed me in the past but they really have opened my eyes and regained my trust with this very nice laptop. I trusted the reviews with this laptop and it paid off so thank you all for the honest reviews as well. It really helped me made this decision. :)"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "I was very nervous as this was my 1st laptop purchase and i decide on the Dell Inspiron i7559-763BLK. I would like to reassure everyone that this laptop is very very good. Very good for gaming and web browsing and most likely anything else one would use a laptop for. I love the design, the keyboard on which I am typing now feels great not flimsy at all and i have rather large hands(not sure how hard people are pushing on it). The track pad works wonderfully I have not had any issues, as for the clicking you have two options a touch click(silent) or a push click(makes audible click noise I find rather nice). I have yet to have the Wifi disconnect on me in fact I can get connected rather far away(I have a acre of land and i can get connected on the hammock far outside). Nividia Geforce driver will automatically prompt you if you need to update and it only takes about 5 minutes. Battery life is about 2.5 hour while gaming and 6 hour web browsing, however the thing takes a full charge in about hour. Power cord and very nice with a built in way to secure the cord during travel. After experiencing what a SSD does i cannot imagine going back to a HHD, there is literally no noise and everything is near instant. The cooling fan only seems to kick in during gaming and it is very quite that sometimes i fear it is work working at all but it is. The back lit keyboard is very nice as well it turns on with the slightest touch on the keys or trackpad and after about 30 seconds of non-use it fades back to black.\n  I guess if there is any complaint it is the finger smudging which only happens i assume cause your all eating Doritos, not really a issue. Also it is a bit warm on the lap which i think is just normal for laptops.\n  This is totally worth 800$, I understand there is better but you must be a real computer snob to pay 2 grand for a laptop that might only work 10% better than this one and have a crazy lighting scheme."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "I previously posted about having received a DOA laptop, and rated the product a one-star as a result. I think that still stands, because receiving a broken product is a terrible experience no one should ever have. However, now that I have received a working product I wanted to give another review. In short, this is one of the best laptops you can purchase for under $1000. My only real complaint with it is the rather limited SSD installed. While it is incredibly fast, booting up in less than 10 seconds, and loading Fallout in seconds, it is only 256GB, so you should prepare to spend an additional $60 to purchase at least a 1TB HDD to install. Luckily, it is a very simply install.\n\nI use a keyboard and wireless mouse, so the keypad and mouse pad on the laptop really don't matter. I also don't have a problem with the screen's brightness, as some people have stated. The laptop also has surprisingly good sound. I used to use external speakers, but I don't feel like I need to with this machine. It is also dead silent, even when playing games at max settings at 60fps. The only time I experienced some minor slowdown was when I (accidentally) had a 1080p 60fps video playing on Youtube, while also playing Dark Souls with HD textures at 60fps. I can't imagine too many games you will not be able to play on this machine.\n\nThe battery life is fantastic as well, as long as you don't upgrade to the (kind of pointless) UHD touchscreen. I also don't think you need the i7 upgrade, unless you want to do some heavy video editing, etc. The i5 is more than enough power for any task that I've used so far. You might be better off spending money on that HDD I talked about, or maybe even an extra 8GB of RAM, which also feels a bit unnecessary to me.\n\nSimply put, you cannot purchase this product soon enough."}

Don't be tricked like me! You might say \"well if you can overclock from 2.3 to 3.2 whats the big deal?\" True, but I wanted to overclock at a BASE 3.2  to something like 3.7-4.0 not 2.3!!! This laptop also comes with a lot of bloatware (McAfee being the worst of them all, funny thing is that when you first boot the laptop on and start installation, it asks if you want to subscribe to McAfee, a big fat NO was pressed, but for some reason Dell doesn't care about your opinion in that matter and installs it anyways.) It can all be deleted, but its a tedious and time consuming hour of doing so.\n\nAnyways, I would rate the laptop much lower than 3 but since Dell \"TECHNICALLY\" told me the processor goes UP TO 3.2 and i just didn't catch it, I won't down a star. Shame on you Dell for tricking people like that! Performance wise, its what you would expect from a measely 2.3 quad core and a nicer 4gb Video Card. It'll run all modern games but not at its highest quality settings at 1080p@60fps, for games like the new Rise of the Tomb Raider, it won't even come close to that."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "Update 2: The screen on the Dell flickers intermittently both when it's on battery power and when it's plugged in.  I've tried dozens of fixes to try and get it sorted, but nothing seems to work. I've decided to give up on this laptop and return it in exchange for something else. I read a ton of information about the flickering screen online and it's an extremely common problem and no one seems to have a fix for it. I suggest you look elsewhere if you need a reliable laptop. This Dell is a mess.\n\nUpdate: I nearly had to return the laptop this week due to a problem with the screen flickering intermittently. Initially, I thought that the screen may have been damaged or come partially unplugged from the motherboard, but I did some research online and found a solution. It turns out that there is a conflict between the Dell power settings and Windows 10. I solved the issue by going to control panel > hardware and sound > power options. Then you click on the blue link for change plan settings and then click the blue link for restore default settings for this plan. I had to go through and change the settings on all of the power plan. I restarted the computer and flickering screen was gone.\n\nGoing through some of the other negative reviews, I highly suspect that employees from the marketing team at Dell have been downvoting the negative reviews to get them pushed to the end of the list. It's pretty obvious when every single negative review has exactly 3 downvotes.\n\nThis laptop is fast and handles games relatively well, but Windows 10 is a real drag. I've been using Windows 7 for several years. After using this laptop for a week, I can tell you that Windows 10 is truly the only thing about it that I don't like. The first thing I wanted to do when I bought this ws load Skyrim to test the frame rate. I had to go to Microsoft's website and download direct X. Then I spent an hour in the bios trying to figure out how to fix my F keys which were disabled by default in Windows 10. Next problem I ran into is that my wireless mouse which works flawlessly in Windows 7 does not work properly in Windows 10. The next problem I ran into was trying to add a second hard drive. Windows 10 changed the name of the disk management tool and decided not to post any information about it on their website. Windows no longer comes with a disk zip utility, so you'll need to download one. They've also changed the default picture viewer to one which will not allow you to zoom in on a photo you've opened, so you'll need to find a new one of those. They've also deleted windows media center, so you'll need to download that. Microsoft office is no longer included with the operating system, so you'll need to pay or download open office. The \"my computer\" icon has been renamed to \"this pc\" for no reason. My documents are now just documents, also for no reason. The support articles on Microsoft's website for any problems you might have are typically one grammatically incorrect sentence which contains zero helpful information. All of the bios functions have been renamed and put into separate sections, so good luck with that. The search button on the start menu will include results from bing by default. So if you need to find a document on your laptop for work, you may also see ads for dick pills (not kidding, that happened).  The start button is back, but it's cluttered with bloatware from microsoft and apps that you won't use, not to mention everything has been renamed. And boy, you're going to love all the questions you'll read when you first boot this thing up. Things like \"Microsoft would like to collect your browsing data and search queries and sell this information to our advertising partners so they can customize your ad experience, yes or no?\" Not kidding. They really ask you that while you're setting it up. I seriously considered putting a piece of tape over my webcam.\n\nNow about the laptop:\n\nIt runs pretty pretty smooth and quiet, but I can hear a low-volume, high-pitched squeak when it's under load. It doesn't seem to heat up. It plays skyrim on ultra and dragon age inquisition on high. it renders in Adobe pretty fast. It boots up in less than twenty seconds. battery life is over 6 hours while web browsing. The Matte screen kind of sucks for clarity, but it's easy on the eyes if you're using it for extended periods at work. The wireless network card seems to connect just fine. The USB ports all work. it doesn't have a cd/dvd drive. It has an open slot for a hard drive. It also has an open slot to add another stick of ram. The processor seems really fast. You can open a ton of programs all once and it never lags. The keyboard is pretty comfortable. It has sort of a rubbery finish to it. The laptop actually feels lighter than I expected. It's definitely not a monster. If I were rating the laptop by itself, I would says its a 4/5. If I were ranking Windows 10, I would says 0/5.\n\nThis is a nice intro gaming laptop. It's not cheap, but it's the best I've seen for under a 1000. I'm not unhappy I bought it, but Windows 10 is going to take some adjusting to. There are a TON of kinks to work out. I run into software problems nearly every day since I bought it. If you're looking for something a bit more trouble free, best to look elsewhere."}

As with any computer make sure you do all of the Dell and Windows updates.  As other reviews have stated there is a little backlight bleed which is not uncommon with lower end IPS displays.  Have two of these laptops and each exhibited the same amount of bleed.  Only really noticeable on dark screens.  Not enough to make me want to return it.  If this was a higher end display I am sure the price point would have been much higher.  Great colors and clear display none-the-less."}

The name of the game is Quality Control, though.\n\nI ordered one of these machines and received it yesterday. After a careful unboxing, I hit the power button. The power light came on and the screen flickered. Then it went off. Then it flickered again. Rinse and repeat. I'm not sure if this is a problem with the memory, graphics card, screen or the connection from the screen to the motherboard but something is seriously wrong.\n\nSo, I sent in a request for replacement. We'll see how this goes on take 2 and I'll update my review.\n\nUpdate: 2 weeks later\nThe second laptop made it here and it worked fine. The performance is great. The design is nice. This is a really nice gaming laptop for someone on a budget. Windows 10 fits the device well. I'm a fan. Still, fix your QC, Dell."}

Honestly the only quirs i have with it are that the ttackpad is a bit more difficult to use than other laptop trackpads but it works well enough and i use my mouse most of the time anyway. The other thing is its a bit on the heavier side but still managable. Everything else seems great so far. I love the screen its actually really nice in my opinion then it has an m. 2 ssd which ia amazing honestly what yoy are getting for this price is crazy. Plus it has a space to put in another ssd and another ram stick whixh are easily accesed. My previous laptop was a lenovo y50 andi paid 1400 dollars for it. Horrible experience as the hinges on it started failing so quickly making my laptop bend out of place until it messed up both my screen and laptop covers which cost almost 500 bucks to fix so i said no and gor this instead. The build here is much stronger and the hinges seem like a rock right now we will see with time. Plus dell support is amazing, while lenovo support leaves something to be desired. They shipped latops with faulty hinges and don't even take responsebility. Anyway I highly reccomend this laptop, this the absolute best value for the price."}

The i5 6300HQ is a step up from what I found in most other Skylake i5 laptops (most commonly the 6200U)\n\nThe best feature in my opinion is the ability to access the internals via the bottom panel for upgrades.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "Prior to ordering, I read all of the reviews on Amazon and knew that there would be some issues with the WiFi, the screen, the trackpad, etc... and they would/could be fixed by updating drivers.\n\nI am pleased to say that I had absolutely no issues with the laptop. Once booted up (which took a whole 9 seconds thanks to the SSD) I first ran the system update, and to my surprise, everything was up to date. I have had no issues with wifi dropping out at all like others have reported.\n\nAnother thing people were having issues with was the trackpad. I have used laptops all my life and this trackpad is no worse than any other ones I have used, and better than some. Besides, I use a mouse instead of trackpads unless the situation doesn't allow it.\n\nThe sound on this the best I've seen (heard) on a laptop. Period.\n\nLooking for a laptop,  I told myself that a SSD was a priority and I'm glad I stuck to my guns. Like I wrote before, the computer boots up in under ten seconds. While it's not the largest hard drive in the world, the laptop does have an open slot just waiting for and additional drive. I took a 500gb hard drive out of an older laptop I had, and after removing one screw, not 10 like some other laptops I've worked on (I'm looking at you MacBook Pro) I removed the bottom and attached the spare drive. Windows 10 immediately recognized it and I was good to go. All was done in under two minutes.\n\nOne thing I would have preferred this system to have was a metal case instead of plastic, but after using the laptop its a non issue. The plastic does not feel cheap at all and is rather sturdy.\n\nSince my experience was so good right out of the box, I can only speculate that they are shipping out updated systems."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "I've been using this laptop for about three weeks as of this writing, and while it's certainly a decent machine for the price, I do have a few reservations about it.\n\nFirst the good:\n- Boot times are fast. I would wager it takes about 10-12 seconds from waking up until you're ready to do with it what you will. The solid-state hard drive also ensures your programs will load near instantly. Battery life is also incredible. It will of course vary with what you do, but if you're just using the machine to surf the web at moderate brightness settings, you can probably get 10 hours use out of it with a full charge. Speaking of the screen, it's bright, the colors are vibrant, and it displays a native 1080p signal. Text is crisp and easy to read. This laptop is also pretty powerful for its price range. You won't be able to run new games at ultra settings and 60fps, but it will probably run most games well enough if you're willing to make a few compromises here and there.\n\nNow the not-so good:\n- It's a bulky machine. This was needed to house the hardware inside, but the trade-off is a laptop that's not as portable or comfortable to use as some of its competitors. The spacebar on the keyboard also doesn't register a press all the time. It's annoying to peck something out and look up only to find a bunch o fwordsstrungtogether. My biggest gripe by far, however, is the rubberized texture that covers everything. It feels fine, but it smudges and smears like nothing I've ever seen before. You'll get visible fingerprints on it in no time, and nothing seems to get them off. My laptop is three weeks old, but from outside appearances, it could easily pass for three years. Coming from a sleek aluminum build on my last laptop, this is a huge detractor. Also, while this is no longer an issue, setting it up for the first time was a real hassle. The wi-fi wouldn't stay connected to my router for more than a few minutes at a time, and once it disconnected, that was it. It wouldn't right itself until I rebooted it completely. I eventually had to plug it into an ethernet cable to allow it to download some critical updates, but after that, it's been working fine. Just something to keep in mind.\n\nAnyway, that's my review. I still think it's one of the better laptops out there for the price, but it's not everything it could be."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "I've had this laptop for about three months now. I bought it off of the Dell website itself, for a little under $800. Given that price point, it's a rather beefy laptop. If you're playing anything older than a couple years, it will easily run at 1080p at high settings without many frame rate hiccups. Even brand new games can run at 1080p with moderate settings without going too low on FPS.\n\nPros:\n-Great price/performance ratio. Aside from building your own desktop, you're unlikely to see this level of performance at this point elsewhere, especially on a laptop\n-The screen looks crisp and clear and has great color balance. Maxes out at 1920x1080 resolution, fairly standard for a good laptop\n-Very speedy load times. I had the model with the hybrid 1TB HDD and it boots up for me within a minute, typically.\n-The speaker bar has great volume and sound quality. Not as good as buying a nice pair of headphones or expensive speakers, but better than most mid-range laptop speakers\n-The keyboard and mousepad feel good to the touch and look great as well\n\nCons:\n-Like other reviewers have said, quality control on this machine is a definite flag. Thankfully, my issues have been minor, but there's always some sort of bug going on. I'll list a few below.\n-When I first purchased the laptop, getting Windows fully set up was very problematic. It was bad enough on my end to make me decide to make a recovery disk and just reformat from the start. Which, given Dell's crapware, might not have been a bad idea regardless\n-When coming out of sleep mode, it bugs out and often just hangs in some weird semi-powered mode. Hard resets solve the problem, but it's a nuisance that would be even worse if the boot times were slow.\n-The fan, when this laptop is under heavy load (like during a game) is fairly noisy. It's not unbearably loud, but headphones would be the preferred option for a clear listening experience.\n-This might have been a one-time issue, but it was rather infuriating for me when I came across it. When the laptop freezes, it's possible to not have it respond to the power button. Obviously, removing the battery is the next best step, but the battery on this device is hidden beneath a screwed in panel. It requires a fairly small philips screwdriver to open, a size I did not have handy when the issue came to my attention.\n\nIf you get lucky with a well-built machine, count yourself lucky. QA issues are by far the biggest problems on this machine, and if you can avoid them, it's a great laptop for the price."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "It is a great gaming laptop considering the price. Again It is a great laptop but not a perfect one. As like everything cheap, it has its own flaws. The screen is somehow disappointing. The key board is not of gaming quality and the backlit light is white where i think red would've been perfect as the whole laptop has a red accent. Although the laptop is sturdy but the material is not the best I've seen. But it doesn't feel cheap at all. It is also bit a heavy and on the bulky side. Aside from the outside, in terms of performance this laptop is a beast at this price range. Mine is the base model with core-i5 and 8gb ram. I've upgrade it to 16gb and added a 7200 rpm hdd. The boot time is surprisingly very fast for the ssd. I would suggest not to fill your ssd. The gtx 960M is just awesome is exactly the thing that makes this laptop a beast. I know it is inferior comparing to Desktop graphics but as a laptop graphics it steals the show. Only the Gtx 970m and 980m is better than this. Honestly they are way better than 960m but still it performs really well on the latest games like Battlefield 4, Fallout 4 and very demanding Witcher 3. It delivers an average of 40 fps at a medium setting with 1080p res at Wtcher 3. I even played the Division beta on it and I was amazed how well future game perform on this Beast. I absolutely love this after using it for 1 month and I didn't have single problem. So, I would absolutely recommend this laptop to those who are finding a budget gaming laptop."}

I wasn't really looking for a gaming computer, as such, but the combination of the 6th-gen i5, 8GB, SSD, and IPS panel as well as the ease of access to the components pushed me to this one and I'm not disappointed. The 4GB GTX960M is icing on the cake. Very fast and runs the heck out of anything, including my (admittedly aging) Steam library. This is my first SSD and there is no going back.\n\n After reading reviews I knew what to expect so updated all drivers right away.\n\n The display is somewhat dim, but angles are still far better than a typical TN panel so I'll deal with it - not an issue in my application really.

I couldn't believe what all this came with for $800.\nA dedicated 960m GPU, SSD(256GB), IPS 1080p screen, and a Quad Core i5. I thought surely the build quality would be cheap, but I was wrong. It feels sturdy and well built. It has a nice matte/soft feel to it. I do not like glossy laptops or monitors so this is a big plus for me.\nIt is definitely a gaming laptop, but it's not over the top. It says, I like to play games, but I'm also an adult with a career. Personally, I wouldn't want to play games like GTA V on this computer, but that doesn't mean it can't handle it. This laptop is more ideal for games like Diablo, WoW, etc. You will want a mouse to go with it though for obvious reasons.\nFor the price I can overlook the fact that it only came with one stick of 8 gb ram, but it would've been nice to have two 4gb sticks rather than one 8 gb stick. That way you would at least get access to dual channel speeds. It's not a huge deal and by no means a deal breaker since you probably wouldn't notice much of a difference. I just like to get the most out of my computers. I did add a 500 gb hard drive for game storage. 256 gb will fill up fast with modern day games reaching 20-50 gb.\nAnother great thing about this laptop was that it came with minimal pre-installed software (bloatware). It came with McAfee and some basic dell software. This means a lot to me since I do not like spending a lot of time uninstalling bloatware or worse, re-installing windows. Thank you Dell for listening to the consumer and keeping the bloatware to a minimum. I am looking at you HP.\nThis is my third laptop. I have owned an HP laptop from 2009. A Macbook Pro Retina, and now the Dell Inspiron. I would say this laptop is by far the best value laptop I have owned. It gives me the feel of my high end desktop, but is half the cost (My gaming desktop cost around $2K). I actually prefer this over my old Macbook. I am just not a fan of Mac OS.\nFor the price you can't go wrong. I highly recommend this laptop if you want a gaming laptop under $1,000. As of this writing it is around $800.\nIf you want something that will run every modern game at ultra settings you will have to pay a lot more, but I don't think its necessary. This laptop provides a very playable and enjoyable experience and it does so with ease. 10/10, would buy again."}

The red mark signifies where tension becomes too great for the display cable and causes the monitor to lose signal. Otherwise, the laptop is phenomenal minus a few nitpicky issues.\n\nThese are:\n- Staticy/crappy sound on battery due to power saving mechanisms that make audio suffer\n- Very low audio quality unless speaker enhancements are used\n- A really wonky touch pad. Yes, it does make a thud sound when your finger hits it, and it also feels really rough and lacks any sort of response sometimes, whereas other times loves to jump around the screen and randomly decides to miss what you are aiming for, whether it be an X button or minimize button or what not. (Use a mouse for gaming of course)\n- A finish that attracts fingerprints that look greasy and smudge\n\nEDIT: Got the new laptop replacement, it had major screen bleed, but oh well, what can you do.\nAlso, the mentioned audio problems can be fixed with a registry change where you turn off power management specifically for the realtek driver in the registry.\n\nLaptop plays games fine, and boots up really quickly, just wish it didn't have the monitor issues I've been having so far involving the bad connector and screen bleed."}

I updated all the drivers and installed Windows updates, as well as added a second SSD. I've had no problems at ALL. None. Runs super fast, thanks to the SSD. Coming from an old Asus with a hard drive, I can honestly I'm completely in love. Haven't tested out the battery life much yet, but it seems to get maybe 6 hours... with heavy heavy usage (not gaming). Touchpad is... well, horrible. But if you fiddle with the mouse & touchpad settings some, it gets a tad better and you'll find yourself getting used to it. Speakers are FANTASTIC to my ears. Really loud and not tinny when turning it up to 100% like some say.\n\n2/6/2016\nInstalled all updates and updated the GeForce driver and everything is still golden! However, the battery life isn't living up to it's 10+ hours, even with simple, light browsing of the internet. I see some slight screen bleed when turning the computer on and off, but you don't notice it otherwise. Startup and shutdown is a piece of cake! Super fast, just like the programs. Just for fun, I tried to batch load over 700 images into Photoshop layers using Bridge with both this laptop and my old Asus. It took the Asus about 3-4 hours and the Dell Inspirion took MAYBE thirty minutes! This SSD is FANTASTIC. The only con I can really think of is the resolution; it's really high, so everything looks small. If you mess with the settings a bit, it can be changed, but changing it makes everything look a little strange to me. So I just use the zoom function on Chrome and everything is perfect.\n\nGreat great buy! If you're hesitant, don't be! Go for it. Really, it's a wonderful laptop and for the price, you really can't beat it."}

The speed and performance is great as the specs tell it to be. The only thing I was somewhat mad about was the setting it came in. The wi-fi kept on turning off to 'save battery' which I had to mess around for almost 2 days to find out and change. the battery saving feature is just awesome. it even extends the laptop life to 13+ hrs. (i use it on 20% brightness with battery saver. sound @ about 20-50% which is still plenty in my case; not a lot of video watching, although I do watch a handful of short clips like the ones uploaded on Facebook; even with high spec gaming for 1hr the battery is quite well off in its charges)\nthe best bang for the buck I have spend in a long time. I am confident this will last me for next 3 years (if I abuse it) or 5yrs (with minor cautions).\nScreen specs, the glare isn't so bad. if the brightness is increased to 40+% then for sure in almost any day time the screen is visible enough at a compfy level (note it's just a personal opinion).\nThe Keyboard is quite nice, it doesn't have that \"tac-tac\" sound but rather a muffled sound which is really nice. very quiet in typing, and yet the feel is still very rich.\nThe dual fans are super quiet. haven't had any excessive rotation of the fans making ridiculously loud noises. the laptop has been remaining 'cool' if not 'cold' all the time.\n\nif there is a con, then it'd be the touch pad. I would have liked it if it had \"on/off\" feature as part of the touch pad like my older laptop. (still controllable by going to the settings, just bothersome for me).\nalso the headphone port, usb ports... they were EXTREMELY tough to plug into...

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "Was in the market looking for a cheap laptop to use at home for work, and if ever needed, some light gaming. I already have a powerful desktop configuration, but figured that if I wanted to game on the go I could carry this somewhat barely portable laptop with me and it could do the trick. Turns out that it works well. Let's keep this short and sweet.\n\nWhat I liked:\n- Aesthetically pleasing to me. Soft black plastic looks good and feels good. The red accents are a nice touch.\n- Performs really well for everyday tasks and can game too obviously. I was able to play the witcher 3 and it performed on par with my PS4. I also was able to run Just Cause 3 and it worked moderately well as well. I think both games can run at 30fps (so like a PS4) with medium setttings. These are two relatively demanding games, so I was impressed by the performance. I am sure that less demanding games will perform much better.\n- Stays quiet and cool pretty much at all times. I haven't gamed enough to know if it gets hot, or if there are throttling issues.\n- Love that it has a number pad. The Keyboard feels nice. Not as good as my Thinkpad obvi, but it works well.\n- The screen is bright and matte 1080p. It's crisp enough for my liking. I personally do not want anything above 1080p on a laptop, so this was perfect.\n- Battery life is pretty good for what it does. I haven't really run any tests, but I feel like I am getting anywhere between 6hrs to 9hrs per charge.\n\nWhat I do not like:\n- Touchpad: It works, but is not very responsive. You should probably get a mouse.\n- Not sure if it is durable. When the screen is down (laptop is down), the left side does not rest perfectly...not sure what long term implications there are with this.\n\nConclusion: I like this laptop quite a bit. It feels nice and works really well (minus the trackpad). I would argue that you could even make it a desktop replacement if you buy another 8 gb of ram and a larger SSD - the upgrading process is pretty straight forward. Oh and its arguably the best bang for the buck you can get for a gaming laptop.\n\nCheers."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "I like it, but I definitely don't love it. The screen quality is not very good, has a slight blur to it. The mousepad is off-center to the left, which is annoying as a right-handed person; I find myself accidentally right-clicking occasionally because the left area is too far left. I didn't realize there isn't a DVI port, which isn't a big deal as my monitor has HDMI capacity. The first time that I turned it on, the screen was 95% dark and I thought the screen was broken. It started working normally after an hour or two of trying various things, none of which had any effect. It did this 'going dark' thing one other time and I couldn't 'get a hold of Dell support to try and fix it, but it hasn't done it since and hopefully doesn't again. I can probably figure out where to change this, but I am also annoyed that hitting F5 doesn't actually use the F5 function by default if i want to use it to refresh a webpage etc.\n\nSlightly disappointed overall, but it's still decent.

The plastic has degraded the insulation and cut into the conductor. Not happy.\n\n1) The power cord has become loose at the docker that goes into the laptop. Cheap design with visual flair is not preferable to a solid robust connection.\n2) The bleeding around the edges of the screen is becoming worse.

It seemed to turn off the wifi on its own after 10-30 minutes. What I mean by turn off is that the computer would lose connection to the Internet, then lose the ability to find wifi connections. Sometimes if I disabled the connection and turned it back on it would work. Sometimes it would disable itself and required restart. It seemed to work fine while plugged in. I spent a couple of hours downloading and installing windows updates, hardware drivers and Dell drivers on a wired connection to see if it fixed the issue but, it didn't. I tried reformatting the drive (keep in mind this machine doesn't even have personal software on it yet), then going through the entire process 1 driver at a time to see if anything made it better or worse. I tried testing my wifi on 3 different devices including another Dell laptop to see if the issue was related to the router.\n\nEventually, I came to the conclusion that it was either a wifi specific hardware issue or a weird software bug that wasn't worth my time to test for. The computer was fast and responsive and the solid state drive made restarting the computer a dream during the driver updating process. I just can't afford to spend that much money on a laptop that I can't take anywhere.\n\nI sent it back and am waiting on a refund so I can weigh my options. On a side note, I did look at the other reviews before buying this and it seems like a majority of people are enjoying this laptop. It may be just a lemon. Also, the self signing root issues that were mentioned some other comments have been patched out and are no longer an issue.\n\nI would suggest doing your own research before buying this laptop.

I had some problems with the Intel HD graphics driver sporadically crashing and then recovering, but after I completely upgraded to the latest version of Windows 10 I had no problems.\n\nThe fan hardly ever comes on, this computer is mostly silent. The battery lasts for a long time and when you reach 20%, it goes into battery saver mode. It's not a touchscreen, but the screen is crystal clear and easy on the eyes. I read some complaints about the speakers, but they're really great and the subwoofer is a fantastic add-on to it. I was watching a video in HD without earbuds in fullscreen mode; everything was simply beautiful. Windows 10 may need some getting used to, and definitely good Internet, but once you have it all fully customized to your preferences, it is a wonderful operating system to use. It feels clean and light as opposed to previous versions of Windows. The keyboard is like velvet, and you don't feel a need to slam any buttons. The build is not brushed aluminum or anything like that, but it's a very soft plastic that actually doesn't catch fingerprints as much as the other reviews say. I wouldn't recommend eating greasy food and then going directly to this computer, but it still isn't a messy build. The webcam is really good as well and handles bright colors efficiently.\n\nMy only few cons are that the touchpad feels a little cheap and the keyboard depresses slightly. But that's it. This is the best computer I've ever had the pleasure of owning. I run a lot of Photoshop and heavy web browsing and this computer is more than capable of handling it. I was scared I was going to regret this buy, but it was totally worth what little I had to pay. Seriously. Buy this machine."}

I play FIFA 16 and Battlefield 4, and run very well. The trackpad is a little different than the other laptops that I have, but it is a matter of habit. I have this Laptop for 2 months and I still love it as the first day."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "Absolutely love this laptop. This is my first laptop, and when I went in, I wanted something that could handle gaming, but was below the $1000 price point and wasn't too bulky or obnoxious looking. My experience with it has been great so far.\n\nThe packaging was very minimal (probably where some of the budget was cut), arriving in a box with just the basic necessities - charging cord and a few booklets. Right off the bat, though, I was really digging the look and feel of the laptop. The matte surface, though a fingerprint magnet, is preferable to a glossy surface, and the backlit keyboard types nicely and feels pretty natural. The red accents are minor as well, but I like those.\n\nI went ahead and installed Google Chrome, since I've got bookmarks synced to there, and web browsing has been snappy, with the SSD instead of the hard drive. I also downloaded LibreOffice 5.0, which is a free alternative to Microsoft Office, and it gets the job done.\n\nThis works great as a gaming laptop as well, running more demanding games like GTA V, even with maxed out graphics settings. It can also handle whatever you throw at it for casual gaming, running smoothly overall.\n\nI would highly recommend this laptop to those who are willing to spend $800 on a great laptop that gets the job done, for both gaming and working."}

I'm glad I did.\n\nUnlike previous Dells I've dealt with, this one is fast and isn't bloated with software. Yes, it installed McAffee which I uninstalled immediately. But otherwise there's just a Dell Update and Dropbox. So I don't feel cluttered with uselessness.\n\nAs for speed, wow! I'm happy about that. I rebooted after uninstalling McAffee in 15 seconds. The SSD is quite nice. Quad core is great.\n\nAs for durability, it seems like it will hold up. The hinge design looks strong enough to last. Most of my laptops break in that spot..\n\nOverall I'm pretty happy with this!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "This is an absolutely fantastic product. Instead of making long speech about it I'll just leave some pros and cons underneath.\n\nPROs\n - Very fast, overall (the only lag I've ever gotten is wi-fi latency which I was expecting anyway considering I've only been playing games through wi-fi)\n - Clear, high resolution\n - Good speakers.. for a lap top (does not quite compare to my iPod dock but much better than I expected nonetheless; can also get VERY loud if you really want it to)\n - Once you have set it up, the boot time is quite literally only a few seconds (haven't timed it but I'm going to say about 10 seconds or less)\n - Extra SSD slot (enables you to cap your disk space from 256gb to 512gb)\n - Keyboard is very satisfying to the touch. Almost feels like a mechanical keyboard, just without the excessive noise. The vertical and horizontal dimensions of the keyboard/keys are also very nice. I can glide while typing (and know what key I'm pressing) and not have to worry about overextending to reach a key.\n - The  track pad is a good mix between smooth and gritty. Allows you're finger to glide easily without sticking but also lets you know you're actually touching it and not next to it.\n - Battery life is very long. I tested it by playing Need for Speed: Most Wanted at the start of it being fully charged. Played for about 2-3 hours and was only about half way dead.\n - Lit keyboard is always nice if you need some extra light when you're typing. (two brightness settings)\n - Windows 10 is much more similar to Windows 7 in terms of familiarity.\n - Easily finds and connects to your desired connection (assuming you're putting in the password exactly as it is).\n\nCONs\n - Keyboard problems. For some reason (sometimes) when I switch between lets say from Chrome, to Steam, then back my keyboard just completely stops working for like 10-15 seconds. Doesn't happen very often but it's still frustrating when it does.\n - Low disk space. This computer's SSD only comes with 256gb so don't plan on downloading a lot of huge games (the extra SSD  slot will, of course, help with that).\n - High resolution for relatively small screen. This might just be me but my last lap top's res cap was 1440 x 900 with a 15\" screen. This lap top's res caps at 1920 x 1200 with an increase of only 0.6\". Everything on the screen seems a little too small (yes, I know you can change it) but still, this is a minor draw back nevertheless.\n - Only having 3 USB ports can be somewhat constricting depending on what you want to use them for or how many things you want plugged  in at  one time.\n\nOverall, I am more than pleased with this product. I have never had a more pleasurable experience with a computer. Definitely worth the money. Also, please forgive me if I left anything out of the review. I did my best with what I could remember offhand."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "Let me preface with I rarely ever leave reviews for products but this product deserved a review. I purchased this laptop with the intention of using as a primary laptop for school and web browsing but also for playing games. I'm a firefighter and work 24 hour shifts so being able to take this from home to work was a must have. I'm happy to say this laptop is a bit bigger than most other 15 inch notebooks but not too much. I find it to be a very good size for typing, doing laptop work and extended gaming sessions comfortably. The keyboard is very good and don't think i'll have any problems typing papers. The keyboard back lighting is white and in my opinion good with 2 brightness settings and an additional setting to turn it off. I don't really use the track pad and thus can't really report anything on it.\n\nThe screen is 1920x1080p and very good. It has good viewing angels and have not had any problems with light bleeding or any other screen defects. Its very easy to read and bright enough to see anywhere I'm at. Now the performance of the laptop is top notch. The Core i5, 8gb RAM, and 256gb SSD have delivered superb performance for the light load I've put it through. In 2 weeks 1 program closed and that has been the only problem with the laptop I've had.\n\nNow for the gaming performance, while CONNECTED to the power supply its amazing. for only $800 you are getting the most up to date Skyline i5, 8gb DDR3 1633 RAM, 256gb SSD which is in m. 2 format, and a dedicated 960m graphics card all presented with a great 1080p panel. This is an amazing deal. You can spend $1000+ and probably still not get as good hardware as you can with this. I can run Fallout 4 at stock medium settings at 40fps+, Witcher 3 at medium settings at 30fps+, CS GO maxed at 60fps+, SWTOR Ultra settings at 50fps+. Now I can run Fallout 4 at a steady 60fps if I tweak the settings a bit at 1080p, and Witcher 3 at 40fps+ again if I tweak it at 1080p. I would not expect to buy this and think you can max out every game at 1080p, however if you are willing to tweak the settings a bit you can have a great laptop running the latest games at good frame rates. As for old games this is great and would not worry about performance. Now I specify while its connected because while its disconnected the intel integrated graphics take over thus the gaming performance takes a big hit. I have not found a way to turn off the intel graphics but this isn't an issue for me anyway so its up to you to decide if this will be an issue for you. Also, the fans can be loud while running intensive games like Witcher 3 but I don't mind as I expect for the fans to be a bit loud. Its not distracting but you will hear it if you pay attention to it.\n\nOverall my computer has had no problems and would highly recommend this to anyone who wants a good budget gaming laptop. 10/10 would buy again."}

However it is a replacement for an Ultrabook Lenovo 2 Pro that even though I treated it with kid gloves died in less than 24 months.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "I did an exorbitant amount of research looking for a new laptop. I had extremely high standards: I wanted something overly powerful, functional and some ability to be upgraded without being required to be the subject of medical experiments (aka not too damn expensive).\nThis laptop is all that in a sleek package.\nI'm not a computer gamer per se but the ability to play some Gamecube emulators is quite lovely xD The touchpad is a bit strange to be fair, but any decent bluetooth mouse resolves that issue simply and cheaply.\nThe keypad is fantastic, responsive, fluid (I'm typing on it currently) and it feels quite good compared to any other keyboards I've used, especially Macs.\nIf you're a journalist or student like me, it's a salient aspect to consider. It isn't a small laptop but it in no means cannot be easily transported -- in the sense that if you're not too dainty, it's not at a real burden to carry this marvelous machine around. Some reviews I've seen slammed it's lack of portability but c'mon folks, people used to lug around MUCH heavier laptops not too long ago. The specs are spectacular and the portability is quite manageable.\nThe screen is a real treat. Beautiful, no glare at all, stunning. Great graphics.\nSpeakers are quite good, nothing of any auditory exuberance but more than acceptable bass and mids and are better at 65% volume rather than max.\nThe solid state drive makes the computer incredibly fast, start up takes about 10 seconds to access an up, shut down and restart are also very fast. But here's the kicker of all kickers: you can EASILY upgrade this bad boy. I'm talking one screw to open it up.\nI have ZERO computer building experience and I pretty much managed to install a 1TB internal hard drive(has to be 2.5 inches and up to 9.5 mm) in the conveniently empty SATA drive with some googling and helpful tips from other Amazon buyers. And to pass back that favor: unscrew the hard drive bay, keep an eye on the teeny screws, buy some screws and a HD from the lovely Amazon and screw your HDD in to the bay, screw the bay back in, plug in the SATA cable and voila-- SSD speed and an extra TB of memory for all of your media."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "I bought this laptop beginning of this year, and it has exceeded my expectations. After looking at the mixed reviews here on Amazon, I still thought this laptop was perfect for what I'm going to use it for. Although, the 250 SSD was not enough space for all the video and media I was going to be downloading, and I wanted the i7 processor instead of the i5. So, I signed up for an account at Dell.com, and ordered what I needed specs wise from there. The only complaint I have for Dell is that their processing and shipping is slow, as it took 1 week for the custom specs, and almost 5 more days to ship. Anyway, when I got the laptop, it was already installed with Windows 10, all I had to do was sign in and I was shown the desktop screen, in just a few seconds! I made sure to update everything so I got no problems with audio or anything else and it still works perfectly with no glitches.\nI would highly suggest buying directly from the company instead of from here on Amazon. Dell customer service will make sure your order is in check, and my laptop has no significant problems that have been stated in the comments here. For the price, you are getting a very good deal. And it looks awesome too, so you can show it off to your friends!"}

I'd be happy to answer any questions people have for this laptop, just leave a comment.\n\nPros:\n\n* This thing is fast, you can have 2 video games open and a handful of tabs and it will still run at the speed you'd normally get.  Browsing the web and downloading are quick and easy tasks.\n\n* Gaming is great on here, it can play just about any game that's on the market.\n\n* Lots of storage room, I have a ton of games and movies on here along with just normal files that pile up, but it doesn't slow down performance at all.\n\n* Keyboard is nice and smooth and the backlit feature is gorgeous.\n\n* Really that's about it for pros, almost everything with this laptop is fantastic.\n\nCons:\n\n* Touchpad works fine, but the clicking is a bit noisy (a hollow noisy almost), just a tad bit more volume than a normal mouse click.\n\n* Not sure if this is just me, but for some reason having any type of headphones in the volume is loud enough at 2/100 volume.  Sometimes when watching youtube I have to play with the sound bar because 1/100 volume is just too low.  Might be a laptop thing, might be a windows 10 thing, or might just be a me thing i'm not sure.  Certainly nothing to not buy this laptop over."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "I still can't believe I found something this decent as a laptop, for this price. I'm honestly shocked. I've built 4 desktop computers, so I'm not about to say that this will play games at an amazing settings/frames per second. However, this computer is certainly better than most things you will find at this price range.\n\nThe key features that I need for a computer before it's worth it is:\n-Best Graphics card for the price\n-At least 8gb of RAM (more doesn't really matter. 8gb is a very good spot)\n-SSD (120gb is good, more is fantastic!)\n-Quad Core\n-Runs Windows (for programs and games)\n\n[This laptop has all of this.]\n\nThe graphics card for this is a 960m. It's average 3d benchmark is almost 1700 (all posted Benchmarks can be found on the same website if you google it), which isn't all that wonderful when you compare it to a GTX 980 (which in comparison, has the average benchmark somewhere around 9700). This is a micro graphics card, because you just can't install a full-size graphics card into a laptop for a number of reasons. If you want the best graphics, build your own PC. However, this is certainly better than Integrated Graphics (Intel HD 5000 has the average 3d benchmark around 600 - NEVER buy something with Integrated Graphics if you want to play video games).\n\nLet's get realistic, a 970m is going to be much better (average 3d benchmarks around 4200), but wasn't worth the extra money spent for me. A 950m isn't going to be as good (average 3d benchmarks around 1400) as the 960m, but I have seen a lot of laptops offer the 950m for this same price range. Overall, if you are buying laptop for gaming you need to understand this. The 960m, which this laptop has, is a great deal. Heck, looking at some of the other laptops on Amazon, I'm seeing people buy a laptop with a 960m for $1100+. To push this point even further, I'm seeing people buy laptops at $1000+ and they still have Integrated Graphics (which sucks!!!).\n\nIn summary, don't be a sucker and buy a laptop with a 950m, 940m, ANY FORM OF INTEGRATED GRAPHICS (Intel HD 5000). This is a great machine, and it's super quick because of the SSD (I'm not exaggerating. Once you get a SSD, you will never go back to a Hard-Disk Drive). It may not be the very best on the market, but that's actually a good thing for a number of reasons.\n\nThink about it this way: Laptops don't have the longest life span. It's not like a desktop PC, where I can just install a new Graphics Card and re-use my old parts. As technology advances, we tend the previous \"better versions\" of the product become cheaper. Objectively, this laptop is nearly as good as the other $1200+ laptops minus the CPU (which doesn't really need to be the best. You won't ever feel the difference unless you are doing a lot of CPU intensive things) and GPU (which this GPU, or graphics card, is more than capable of running a lot of games at decent settings. The 970m alone is several times better than this but typically is NOT worth paying $300+ more for me). In 5-10 years when you have to upgrade your laptop, you will be glad that you didn't buy that you didn't waste a crap ton of money over a laptop that wasn't that objectively better. Realistically, in the next 5 years, Graphics Cards will be SEVERAL times better than this current generation. Wait, and save that money for something else.\n\nFinal notes: The laptop has pretty good battery life, doesn't come with a whole lot of crap software, doesn't have a glossy case finish (I'm not a a fan of glossy), and has a pretty decent touch-pad. It looks pretty attractive if you like black/red, and it has another slot to add in more Storage. Overall, I'm super happy I purchased this. I have literally no complaints as of yet. It's no desktop, but it's a good laptop for the price."}

I use a wireless mouse because thats what I prefer, but Dell needs to work on the touchpad issue.  It is also a finger print magnet, but I guess that is to be expected because of the matte finish.

I really just play CS:GO, but I've fired up some AAA games like TW3, GTA5 and BF4 and it handles them perfectly fine at a mix of medium- high settings, with ultra sometimes.\n\n- The rubber coating around the laptop feels really nice, although it is prone to showing fingerprints.\n\n- Battery life is pretty good actually. I don't really see why people are complaining about it. It's a gaming laptop, they aren't really supposed to last long anyways. I can get through a 7 hour day of high school with note taking, video watching, and the occasional video editing with a decent amount of battery left over.\n\n- I was worried about getting the I5 one over the I7 because I believed that it wouldn't perform well in more CPU intensive games, but I was wrong. Saved myself $100 this way.\n\n- The build for the most part feels pretty solid, however the area around the lower screen and the area where the screen magnetizes to the laptop feel a little flimsy\n\n- Thank god for SSDs. That's all I have to say about that\n\nCons:\n\n- First, foremost, and most obvious: The track pad sucks. I normally wouldn't be using the laptop without a mouse anyways, but sometimes, especially at school, I just don't have that choice. It feels cheap (But what the heck, it's $800 for a a gaming laptop that actually does well in games), it registers finger gestures pretty poorly, and looks ugly, in my opinion.\n\n- I personally am not a huge fan of the keyboard. Nothing functionally wrong with it, I just don't like the mushy feel, although some may like it.\n\n- The screen doesn't get that bright\n\n- Not a fan of windows 10, but that's just a downgrade away\n\nNot a personal complaint, but I've heard Sandisk, the company that makes this SSD is known for unreliability.

There is a small amount of bleed when booting up but this become unnoticeable once this laptop is at the home screen.\nResolution is crisp and bright but not exactly 4K quality. Adding another memory card to double the capacity makes this laptop lightning fast to go along with the hard drive.\nOverall a very impressive package. I did a lot of research at this price point and could not find a better cost to hardware comparison.\nI would not hesitate to buy this laptop if you are looking to stay under $1000."}

Had a bunch of kernel security check errors and sometimes multiple times a day I would get errors for onboard intel graphics has failed and has to restart. Ran diagnostics on Intel, Microsoft and Dell websites and all came up showing nothing wrong but the reliability log was full of resets and hardware errors. Finally Dell said to reload Windows so I did and the errors continue. Then on the Dell diagnostic help chat I was disconnected 2 times from the service technician and each time another Dell technician would enter and start the chat and diagnostics all over again. Finally they said their diagnostics they had run said the Motherboard was bad and needed to be replaced. This computer is going back and I will think about if I want to take a chance on another one or something different. The online Dell repair technicians I dealt with were friendly and helpful."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "**EDIT 12/28/2016** Nearly a year later, all of the below comments still apply. It still boots in 5 secs on average. It still runs smoothly. All is well and I'm still happy with the purchase.\n\nReading these reviews I was a little nervous about throwing down $800+$100(2 yr protection)+taxes. But I'm glad I made this purchase, and I hope you read on, because you will be too. The long and short of it is that I've had, quite literally, zero issues after 2 weeks.\n\nI game. And when it comes to computers, I usually just seem to have lousy luck. 4+ years ago, I bought an Alienware M15x that at the time was around where this thing is now from a gaming standpoint, not top-of-the-line, but no slouch either. I threw down like $1200 for that dang laptop and it performed like a champ 90% of the time, but from day 1 I would get my screen going black and saying \"video driver disconnected but recovered\" and other scary messages like that.\n\nSeeing other reviews, I knew I had a chance of getting an iffy laptop, but I took a leap of faith anyway, and I'm really glad I did. I unboxed this thing as if it was about to get hung up in the Louvre, handling with exaggerated caution. I plugged it in to a new surge protector I bought to go with it. Hooked in my new wireless mouse that I also bought to pair with it. And booted it up. It starts up like a monster. A very quiet. Very sleek. Monster. The very first time you turn it on it leads into the computer set up screen so you can tell it the date/time/etc. Then every other time it boots to windows or to your user login screen within 6-7 seconds, every time. I turn my computer off and unplug it every time I'm done using it, because getting back to your home screen takes so little time, I'd rather protect against random surges than save 6 seconds.\n\nUpon first getting into windows I recommend doing the following: Go into add/remove programs, and delete McAfee immediately. Then, go to your setting and the device manager, and update your drivers. I updated my speaker drivers and my wifi drivers, immediately, and I have had zero issues with either since. Your AMD video card will prompt you to update it's driver too in it's own little AMD window. That was it. That was all I've had to do and my computer has been running like Angelina Jolie in the mediocre film Salt. I also went into settings>security and got Windows Defender up and running and doing it's own thing.\n\nPROS:\n- Quiet - my Alienware M15x was roughly 5X as loud when running games - I never hear this thing\n- Runs every game like a boss - this thing D-slaps EU4, League of Legends, and most steam games\n- Sound (except the bass) is good for most uses, though I mostly use headphones\n\nCONS:\n-If this is a subwoofer my wife's chihuahua is a direwolf - don't expect bass, but the rest of the sound is really fine for everything else.\n\nReally the subwoofer is the only downside, and if that's it, you know you should get this bad boy. Browses and streams perfectly that I've seen. WiFi works great.\n\nAlso, I don't give a hoot about finger prints. I bought this thing to donkey-stomp games at an insanely good price, not to care about finger prints. But because I don't like junk building up on my keys I wash my hands between eating and using the laptop, I recommend you do the same with any computer. I haven't seen any finger prints on it, especially on the case, I don't know what kind of Dorito binges some of these people are on, but the outside/casing really doesn't get my finger prints on it very easily.\n\nAfter all this, I have to say this is a good buy. I think it's worth maybe having to chance getting a defective one to get a good one, because the good ones go beast-mode."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "The keyboard is very soft, so when I type it kinda sinks. I dislike that.\n\nThe touchpad is so big that to keep my hands on the wasd keys, my wrist gets an uncomfortable position on the edge of the laptop. That may be due to my big hands. Maybe someone with regular hands can place it comfortably on the laptop.\n\nAlso, yesterday was my first day of usage, and it already freezed a couple of time (when changing video configurations on game). Lets hope this doesn't keep going.\n\nI know these are only bad things, but the thing is there is no reason for me to repeat what other already discussed. The laptop is great, and there are only a couple of other options for the same price/benefit. So, far, it's a solid 4 star for me."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "For the price of only $799, there's a lot of things this laptop does right. I will review every aspect and part of this laptop to ensure you make the proper decision when considering laptops.\n\nThe Display.\n- It is bright at max, but I prefer it at halfway brightness because it doesn't hurt my eyes. The colors are accurate and good, the contrast is also well-done for a laptop display. The blacks are black. I noticed people complaining about light bleeding, if you fullscreen display a black image on your screen, you can see a little bit of light-bleeding near the bottom and the top. It's not noticeable otherwise. When playing games the screen looks super sharp, colorful and great.\n\nThe Keyboard.\n- The keys are a little bit too small for my taste, but after typing a number of sentences, I got used to the keyboard and now it doesn't hinder my typing performance. I also like the back-lighting on the keyboard as it makes it easy to see the keys.\n\nThe touch pad.\n- The touch pad is nothing to be proud of for this laptop. It's uncomfortable to use, so I just set up a mouse. The clicks on it are good though.\n\nThe graphics power.\n- This laptop has a lot of graphics power. I ran Battlefield 4 at 1080p high-ultra settings and it ran around 50-60fps.\n- This laptop can run pretty much every game at 1080p.\n- There's the option to limit the framerate in your games to save power. That option is in the GeForce Experience panel.\n\nThe processing power.\n- The i5 6300HQ  is a very good processor. It turbo-boosts up to 3.2GHz. It can handle pretty much every task you throw at it.\n\nBattery life.\n- When gaming, you can get roughly 2-4 hours of battery, depending on the game you're playing.\n- If you're just sitting in a coffee shop, you can expect to get 8+ hours of battery if you turn on battery-saving mode. (At 3/10th brightness)\n- When battery-saving mode is turned on, I saw no performance issues when browsing the web.\nI really appreciate that Dell put a good battery in this laptop. In many gaming laptops the companies put cheap batteries in their gaming laptops which make it difficult to use it at school or other settings because it's always dieing all the time. This laptop can make it throughout the entire day, unless you go gaming of course.\n\nThe hard-drive.\n- The 256GB SSD is very fast. It took my computer 4.5 seconds to turn on after turning it off. That is extremely quick.\n- There is an empty m. 2 slot if you want to add a m. 2 ssd. There is also an empty hard drive bay if you want to add a sata SSD or HDD.\n\nBuild quality.\n- People mentioned the screen flexing. I noticed when I'm on the computer, there's no screen flexing unless I somehow oddly decide to start pressing on my screen to make it purrrrrr. In reality, I don't see why people like pressing on their screens so much, it's quite perverted.\n- Soft-touch plastic feels good, It makes me want to pet my laptop sometimes.\n- The dell logo in the back is red, but doesn't light up unfortunately, but it still looks good.\n- This laptop looks like a mix of badass with gamer with professional business. It does a great job of creating a new mix.\n\nLaptop cooling.\n- The fans turn on once every 1.5-2 hours to cool down the processor, otherwise the laptop is completely silent when browsing the web.\n- When doing productivity like word processing, the laptop is completely silent.\n- When gaming, if you limit the FPS to 35ish the fans rarely turn on depending on the game your playing, or they're very low rpm.\n- When gaming, if you don't limit the FPS the fans do turn on and you can definitely hear them, but they're not annoying.\n\nThe speakers.\n- They are not good, but they are not bad also. After letting them break in, I noticed they sounded a bit better than before.\n- Sometimes there is a popping sound when the speakers turn on for applications.\n\nUpgrading.\n- Very easy to upgrade, just remove one screw underneath the laptop then you can add another stick of ram, another HDD, and another SSD.\n\nFor the price.\n- For the price you cannot go wrong with this laptop. It's a hybrid because gaming and business.\n\nConclusion.\nIf you need a laptop for productivity, work, hanging out at coffee shops, school and when you game; this is the laptop for you. It is so because it offers plenty of battery life with also the ability to game when you're bored. So, it can basically be used in all different work settings. I hope I helped you make a decision when purchasing a laptop. It's all about what features are important to you."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "Edit: After 2 months of using this daily, I really have to say It's a great Laptop for the price, the sound software that comes with it is fun to mess around with to change music and whatever you're listening to to the right levels and sound. The battery easily lasts my 4 class 6 hour days with 40-50% left after constant use. With the extra hard drive and big battery in it it does have some heft, but it's very thin so it fits into a backpack nicely. The large screen makes taking notes and doing other things at the same time is very easy.\n\nOverall this is a very good laptop for the price. The screen is very nice, though the backlight could get brighter. The hardware side is fantastic, the i5 is powerfull and the 960m tackles any game you throw at it.\nThe screen has a nice balance of holding itself open without wobbling, while also being easy to open. The trackpad, while not exactly feeling high quality, registers taps and touches better than some of the nicer feeling touchpads on lenovos.\n\n Now the downsides, the soft plastic she'll feels very nice to the touch but fingerprints show up on it very clearly. The screen part honestly feels like I can punch through it with a pencil it's so flimsy. There's some light bleed along the bottom of the screen, i think this is just the shell pushing against the screen a little. Battery life is OK, not as good as others have said. It also runs pretty warm, even at idle.\n\nOverall this is a good laptop for the price, you get really good components in an ok shell.\n\nI would also recommend getting a 2.5\" hard drive to go with it, since the SSD fills up really fast."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "So I have had this thing for almost a week. I got to tell you I like this labtop. Very sleek looking design, the black with red accent colors looks pretty sweet. The feel of it is good. Feels like good quality for sure. This thing boots up in seconds with the SSD, super fast! The new skylake i5 is damn fast and this thing is super quiet. The 1080p screen is prefect, just as good as my Samsung LED in my living room. The backlit keyboard is really nice, works well. Has 3 cooling vents, which keeps this thing nice and cool. The one thing I do like is that is comes with a m2 SSD so I just purchased a 750gb HD to put in the extra 2.5 in slot. I purchased actually another SSD(EVO) but returning that, would rather run the HD for more storage. SSD's are spendy! Recommend just using the SSD for your OS and programs and HD for your storage. Anyways, I really like this labtop, I like it better than the Asus ROG or just as good. Some People say the touchpad is horrible, but it's fine. I'm just a light gamer and basic Internet user and it works good with me. Unless your on the go is the only time you'll use it since you will be using a mouse anyway but the touchpad is good enough for me. I will be installing the extra HD and Ram this weekend. Haven't played any games on it yet but by running the graphics driver test at 60 plus FPS looks like it can game good. For the price of $799 can't beat it."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "Positives:\nNice build, good graphics- tested with 3D Mark and scored a 3917 on the Firestrike demo/benchmark... According to Notebookcheck.net, that is on the higher end of the range of scores from notebooks equipped with a GeForce GTX 960m graphics card.\n\nNegatives: I just noticed a brightdot on the middle of the screen while resetting the laptop to factory defaults.\nTPM chip didn't work at all until I updated BIOS, chipset drivers, and other Intel board-related drivers.\nI had to call tech support to help, but initially, the lady who answered the phone transferred me to a software tech who wanted to charge me... I assume it was because I upgraded the machine to 10 Pro? He transferred me over to hardware support and ironically, that tech walked me through narrowing down the issues and stayed on the line until all the drivers were installed. (Guess that was a positive)\n\nAfter all this, come to find out that bitlocker would only work intermittently as the TPM management console kept throwing an exception error. It did work after a reboot, but I can't deal with that, as I am an IT professional- it has to stay functional without rebooting... Not a fan of intermittent functionality- bad sign of impending hardware failure.\n\nAnother issue is when the computer was on battery, the graphics under load (video game) would stutter every 10 seconds due to not enough constant voltage to support the demand from the GPU I assume. Another deal breaker.\nI am sending it back for a full refund from Amazon and getting an ASUS ROG laptop... See my review in a week to see if I have issue with that one."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "//Update (1/16/16): AC Power Adapter cord must be handled with care as using too much force to disconnect it will create a \"Unable to recognize AC Adapter...\" message on next startup (only if you reconnect it).

Highly recommend downloading the previous version from Dell updates & drivers page: (http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/19/product-support/product/inspiron-15-7559-laptop/drivers).

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "This laptop is an amazing value!  The ssd is fast and smooth.  The screen is crisp with great viewing angles.  The casing has a soft feel to it, which is nice, but will scuff if not taken care of.  The speakers are as good as can be for a laptop.  The keyboard is nice and comfortable, and yes the back light does shine through the letters.  From pictures and videos it seemed it only shown around the edges of the keys.  The track pad however is a bit cheap and lags at times, but I've used worse.\n\nI've heard the graphics card, geforce gtx 960m, is a mid range at best.  However, so far I've had a great experience with it.  It is 4g, so maybe some of the more negative reviews are referring to the 2g.  All I know is that I was able to play Skyrim on ultra setting, maxed out everything, and it was smooth as butter!  Coupled with skylake, 2 fans and the ssd, I never had to wait more than two seconds on a load screen and have yet to have and issues with heat.  Note - Skylake in and of itself isn't going to help much with gaming, but since they removed the FIVR (fully integrated voltage regulator) the cpu is considerably cooler, as in not as much heat.\n\nThis laptop has upgrade potential as well.  Only one RAM slot is taken by a stick of 8gb, so you can add more.  And there is an empty hdd slot, or an empty ssd if you purchase this model stock with the hdd.  On Dell's website this laptop is customizable if you have the extra cash and no interest in upgrading it yourself.\n\nFurther about the speakers.  I've heard some mixed reviews and thought I'd clear that up.  As I said, these are laptop speakers, I don't know why people are expecting too much from them.  Yes the tiny little subwoofer is a joke, but better than nothing I suppose.  These speakers are a lot nicer than others I've had, they are loud and at low to mid levels the quality is nice and crisp.  **NOTE** what I really wanted to mention is the popping sound you may hear.  I saw a review video on YouTube that suggests doing a registry edit.  Before you go messing around with that!  Just make sure the driver is up to date.  That's all I had to do and it fixed the issue.\n\nSidenote* when it comes to updates, found on Windows or manufacturer website, in this case Dell.  I found that some of them, on the Dell website, we're actually dated earlier than what this pc had stock.  So, what you're going to want to do is check in your Device Manager.  You can look up how to do this and what to do on your own.  It takes hours to do this manually for every driver, but well worth it!!  I didn't notice anything wrong with this laptop to begin with other than the speakers, but after doing all the updates this thing was running even better and I didn't come across any hiccups nor did I have to wait very long for any of them to install.  No crashes upon restarts, even with the windows 10 updates that I've had trouble with on other computers.\n\nIn conclusion, I am extremely pleased with this laptop especially considering the price.  In my opinion this is on par with almost any $1,000 laptop out there.  Dell was able to keep the price down by going with plastic instead of aluminum, not adding an optical drive, keeping the ports at somewhat of a minimum and of course the cheapish trackpad.  When on a budget and without building one yourself, you're always going to find yourself in the predicament of weighing your options.  Better cpu vs better graphics card, better hard drive vs more ram, etc.  At $800 and with the options left open for upgrades, in my opinion there are only two laptops I found that are comparable.  I give this laptop 5 stars for sure and would recommend it to anyone!  I hope this review was helpful."}

I looked at computers across the gamut pricing wise, but the features that I was looking for were: (1) 16gb RAM, (2) 512GB SSD hard drive, and current generation processor (I was still open between i5 and i7).  After researching, a lot, I decided on this.  Since it doesn't meet items (1) and (2) on my list, I bet you're wondering why I did buy this.  The reason is simple: This laptop is very easy to upgrade.  To get those two items, I can easily buy 8GB RAM and put in and for the HD, the laptop has a space for a second hard drive, so I can put in 256GB or even a 512GB, and now this computer comes out to a lot less than I was preparing to spend.  I haven't done any of this yet - I have decided to wait until I see how much I really need these items.\n\nNow, all this said, how is the computer?  Well, it runs great.  I installed very few programs since purchasing (basically, just MS Office, Google Chrome, PDF software, and software for my Epson all in one printer).  I did have to turn off a few auto start items because I just don't need them and I did notice that it took longer to boot up with certain items starting up.  While this computer is certainly thicker than my wife's MacBook Pro, this computer was also less than half the cost.\n\nI do have (as of now) two gripes.  The touchpad isn't quite as good as my old one, and with that, I like having a physical button so I know I'm pressing the right button (I don't always look down).  The other item is why is there no light for the Number Pad Lock?  Dell provides one for Caps Lock but not for the number pad.  This is a shame.\n\nWhile not a gripe, this is a worry.  I like that it has USB 3 ports, but it does not have USB-C ports.  As of now, that's ok, but I don't know how quickly USB-C will catch on.  Ultimately, I hope it catches on quickly but that there are adapters to be compatible with older computers such as this.  Right now I only have one device running USB-C (my Nexus 6P), and I have a USB-A to USB-C cord so no worries on that.  Hopefully this will keep up for the next few years so I don't feel that my computer is outdated.\n\nNo regrets.  Highly recommend."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "Must have gotten one of the lemons (returned within 4 hrs).  Right out of the box the screen would flicker constantly.  Updated all drivers (and I mean all drivers) and still had the issue with the screen flickering.  Started losing WIFI connection for no reason (having to reboot to get WIFI back).  System crashed 3 times while trying to fix issues.\nSince updating the drivers didn't correct the problem I started thinking it must be a hardware problem.  I will note that the packaging/shipping could have played a part to the problems as the box containing the computer was able to move freely inside the shipping box (the computer was secured inside the dell box). Got me thinking that maybe the computer had a rough shipping experience and didn't want to take any chances, so the item was returned.\nWish I would have gotten one of the 5 star machines others have received."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "I've owned my Dell Inspiron 15 for about a year now.  Wish I'd gotten something else.  While I liked it to begin with, certain patterns emerged, and checking over the negative reviews I found that I'm not alone.  The touchpad is inconsistent, sometimes you only have to breathe on it, other times you have to jump up and down on it to get it to read.  Also I miss the touchpad on my old HP because it was easier to feel when you were on or off it.  Dell has made such an effort to make the pad flush, and the keyboard all black, that it's hard for the edge of your thumb to feel where it is on the pad.  Since my product, it appears they have now rimmed the pad in red, but I don't look at the keys when I work and the lack of feel makes my work inconsistent.\n\nSpeaking of inconsistent, the SPACE BAR of all things only works some of the time.  I'll be typing away furiously then look at the screen and see that numerous words lack a space between them.  At first I thought I was careless, but then I stared at the space bar and tapped it, and would only get a space most of the time.  In 2015, that could be an issue is discouraging.\n\nFinally there's the Wifi.  It get's interrupted constantly (while other devices off the same router do not).  Reading others' comments I checked that my drivers were up to date and they are.  I WILL say that while it did this from the get go, when it came with Windows 8, I've now upgraded to Windows 10 and that has only made it worse.\n\nI'm so deep into the project that I bought this computer for that I can't afford the interruption to send it back.  Luckily a friend advised me to buy the extended warranty, so I still have time.  I had my last laptop for 7 years; this one I can't wait to be done with."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "I just got this laptop last week with the i5-6300HQ and 256GB SSD. My plan was to use it for simple internet browsing around home, some light Microsoft Office use for work and evening classes, and occasional light gaming. My desktop is a custom PC with an i7-2600K (4 years old, overclocked to 4.6GHz) and GTX 970, which I use for most of my gaming.\n\nFirst, let me talk about price. I bought this laptop as a warehouse deal for $660 before tax and shipping. It was marked as \"Condition: Used - Good - Item is in original packaging, but packaging has damage. Cosmetic damage (Less than 5% ) on the top of the item. Missing manual.\" The laptop arrived with a hairline scratch on the top of the laptop and, as expected, with no manual. Basically a brand new laptop for $140 less than the usual price, or 17% off. $800 is already the lowest price I could find for a laptop with Intel's most recent i5, a discrete GPU, and SSD so the extra $140 below that made this an easy choice.\n\nMy first step after receiving the laptop was to format and reinstall Windows 10. Note that this is not required and probably pointless for average users. Anyway, this was an easy process - I had pre-loaded a USB drive with the correct version of W10 (Home, 64-bit) and all of the most recent drivers from Dell and OEM companies before the laptop arrived so I was ready to go. Installation was a breeze.\n\nThe computer is great for my planned uses. The SSD is an incredibly important part of making a laptop feel \"snappy.\" Many laptops today are still sold with slow 5400 RPM hard drives, so I knew a SSD was one of my must-haves when I was looking and I am so glad I didn't compromise. Simple applications like Chrome load instantly. Larger programs like Civilization 5 load just as quick as my desktop which runs off a performance-oriented SSD. Windows boots in under 10 seconds, which is just as fast or maybe even faster than my desktop. My guess would be that the i7/1TB variant of this laptop would actually feel slower in everyday use than the i5/256GB thanks to the difference in storage medium. If you can make do with the limited storage, go with the SSD variant.\n\nI did encounter one problem with the laptop, but was really my fault and was easily resolved. After reinstalling Windows I noticed that every few minutes the laptop would freeze for 20-30 seconds. Doing some further investigation I found that the SSD was registering as being at 100% usage with no explanation. I resolved the issue by installing Dell's recommended Intel chipset driver, which I had neglected earlier. You likely won't have this problem if you don't do a clean installation of Windows.\n\nAs for build quality, the laptop is superb. The biggest reason I held off on this purchase was because I feared this laptop would be like my old Inspiron from 2010 - cheap and plasticy. Luckily, that isn't the case. This laptop feels like it cost a lot more than it did. The soft-touch plastic and hefty weight make it feel premium, not like the cheapest laptop that just ticked all my requirement boxes. The IPS screen is phenomenal for a laptop. My desktop monitor is also an IPS and I knew I couldn't switch back to TN like my older Inspiron had. The 15.6\" 1080p screen is perfect for anything short of color-sensitive tasks like photo editing.\n\nAs for light gaming, I haven't done much beyond Civilization 5, which it runs well when plugged in. The GTX 960m isn't going to cut it if you want to play Fallout 4 at 1080p/60fps, but at $800 or the $660 I paid for the laptop I don't expect it to. Civ 5 runs at a solid 60fps with all the settings on high and AAx2. When unplugged these same settings get me about 25-30fps. The 6300HQ processor handles turns almost as well as my desktop's 2600k, but Civ 5 probably isn't the best measure of CPU ability. The massive heatsink lets me run the GTX 960m with the maximum overclock allowed through the software, +135MHz, without concern for heat. I wish there was a simple way to overclock the CPU as well because there is definitely room to work with. Again, though, this is a mid-range laptop and I know this won't matter to most people.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this laptop at $800 and especially if you can get it lower. If you don't mind a scratch or an open box, check out the \"used\" section for deals from Amazon Warehouse Deals which regularly has this laptop for $699 and, if you're lucky, $659."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "So far, I love it.\nIt's fast. Startup, shutdown, and wake up are all almost instant.\nI got another 8GB of RAM, which is easy to install. I also installed a 1TB HDD for extra storage (tip: the new HDD won't just show up as a usable drive, so remember to initialize it, which is also easy. Just search for \"initialize HDD\" and it takes about a minute).\n\nKeyboard layout is nice, not cramped like other laptops I've owned.\n\nThe only thing I don't like so far is how flimsy the top half/screen feels. You MUST lift it from the center, which I guess is something you deal with, with one of these thin laptops. Definitely NOT a dealbreaker for me.\n\nOverall, I'm happy with it."}

I will update again, so far i love it!!!\n\nUpdate-----------------------------\nI've owned the laptop for about 3 weeks now. I am still rating this product to a 5 star. Most of the negative comments have been about quality issue from a defective product. So really, they aren't real reviews of this laptop. Although since I was moving to Japan I was worried about getting a defective product because of a QA issue, but all was well with mine.\n\nHaving said that, here is an updated review for 3 weeks of use. Also I think most people cover the Pros really well, and frankly I don't think we need any more reassurance about how good this laptop is and cost performance etc etc, but rather I will write the cons I found and hopefully it will illustrate a little more about this laptop\n\nCons-\n- The touch pad is indeed a week point in this laptop. But really if you will mostly be using a mouse then its not even a problem\n- Easy to get dirty. This laptop can get dirty real fast from oil from your hands and fingers. Its also kind of hard to rub off. Make sure to get a decent cleaner or wiping material to clean the laptop, in other wards take care of your laptop and you won't even see this as a problem\n\nThats all I got for cons really, just two things after using it daily for 3 weeks. People complain about the sound quality but I mostly use headphones so its not even an issue. And when im not using headphones its still not an issue anyway. If you want real good sound, then I would not rely on laptop speakers anyway. Get your own sound system for that?\n\nI will update again"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "My use case for this laptop is as follows: a somewhat light laptop to use around the house that can also play today's games with some of the graphics turned up.  I have a dedicated gaming machine so this laptop doesn't have to return the highest FPS I've ever seen but it has to play the games with some of the bells and whistles turned on.  So far, I'm happy with my purchase.\n\nI was hesitant to purchase this laptop based off of the negative reviews, I've had it < 24 hours, so perhaps my own review is worth a grain of salt, but here are my items of note to help the next potential buyer:\n- Update the drivers and perform all OS updates - Dell, nVidia and Windows.  Every computer, regardless of make or OS requires it, yes even a Mac needs updates.  If you're not tech savvy and feel this is something you shouldn't have to do with an out-of-the-box solution, a $3,000 Mac needs it as much as this $800 Dell, as much as a $35 Raspberry Pi.  The Dell website does a decent job of directing you to the correct location to download all the updates, and there are 11 or 12 driver updates and a BIOS update.\n- Out of the box some of the text looked fuzzy, I found that the Windows text size is set to 125% by default, I changed it to the \"normal\" 100% and it looks fine to me.  To fix this, right click on the desktop and click on \"Display Settings\", you'll now see a bar, a drop down box, another bar and the ubiquitous \"Apply\" and \"Cancel\" buttons, the first bar controls the text size, click and drag it to the left and you'll see the percentage drop, click \"Apply\" and you're done.\n- Before turning the laptop on I opened the bottom cover and found that I do in fact have the SATA connector for an extra drive (some folks had said their connector was missing), so I installed a 5400rpm WD Blue 7mm 500GB HDD, I also installed 4GB of RAM.  The system properly shows both drives and 12.0 GB of RAM.\n- The 'bloatware\" that would normally come on a laptop is minimal, some Dell \"utilities\" as well as McAfee, but that's all.  I removed McAfee because I prefer Avast, removed all of the Dell \"utilities\" and added Malwarebytes, so far the laptop is performing admirably.\n- Trackpad seems to be a little loose - it'll doesn't wiggle around but it does make a small \"thud\" sound when clicking on anything.  Otherwise it's serviceable, not the best trackpad, but not the worst either.\n- I like the keyboard, the backlight is white and there are two brightness levels, which is just about perfect for playing at night or during the day.  The key travel feels natural and it has a solid feel.\n- Power cable attaches on the left side, so those of us who use a mouse with their right hand will enjoy not having the power cable to contend with for proper mouse usage.\n\nOverall I like the laptop, it's fast and powerful, I'm able to play Fallout 4 on medium settings and get frame rates in the mid 40's, which is certainly playable.  I play World of Warcraft on Ultra settings and it's just fine for most outdoor/world things but raids tend to slow it down a bit, if I change the settings from Ultra to High then everything is smooth and >= 60 fps.  I have't been able to play anything else yet, but I will update this review as I play more games.  Web browsing, general usage and coding are all fine with no slow downs or problems, I'll install Unreal Engine 4 this evening and see how it works building and playing a level, but I anticipate it will be fine.\n\n**Update 01-06-2016**\nI was able to get GTA V running 1920x1080 @ mostly Very High settings and achieved mid 40's FPS, which is fine, turning some settings (like AA) will improve frame rates.  Dying Light was perfectly playable in the mid 40's FPS with a few settings turned down (AA again).  The Long Dark was pushing 30's to 40's FPS on Ultra, but when turned down to High it was in the 50's to 60's FPS, which is fantastic.  UE4 editor ran perfectly well and it built a test level in a few minutes - the 1920x1080 resolution on a small screen makes using the editor a chore, so I wouldn't recommend it unless you're going to use an external display.  Feel free to ask questions in the comments if there's something that you would like me to check for you.\n\n**Update 01-16-2016**\nI decided to return the laptop because the color accuracy was so far off and the lightbleed around the bottom edge of the screen was very apparent during games where the screen is very dark or black.  I knew the color accuracy would be bad going into it, and it didn't bother me at first, but the last straw was when I played Far Cry 3 and instead of a lush green jungle island, I was presented with off-green/greenish tan foliage.  Other games, such as World of Warcraft and GTA V exhibited the same behavior.  I thought I could just look past it at first, but I couldn't.  The rest of the laptop review stands as-is, I don't know if this is a defect in workmanship because I've seen this mentioned in a number of reviews, so I think this is just how the screen behaves, so I haven't deducted a star from it.  However, prospective buyers should be aware of the color accuracy and light bleed, as well as the positive aspects of it."}

I just ordered myself a thin 500GB 7200 rpm drive along with and extra 8GB of RAM.

I've been downloading the games, such as Battlefield 4 and I immediately notice that the battery life is awesome. (Main reason I bought this). Overall, took about 30 minutes to set up. However, it is a blank slate, so you got to download and install everything you need. Seems very fast to me and backlit keyboard is automatic (meaning if you type, it lights on). I'll do another review after half a year to see how it is running.\n\nMarch, 2018 Update: Alright, so the laptop is still running fine after a little over one year. The screen problem did occur after about 1.5 years. I had to replace the screen, large yellowish hues appeared on the sides of the screen. The laptop doesn't freeze anymore, so it seems it was some problem with windows before. I As for running games, the laptop is still great. I can run BF4 at medium settings: 60 fps+, or high: 30 fps+. Same for battlefield 1. For running regular programs: excel, matlab, and etc. It works great. Wifi reception is still going strong. The only thing is that the battery has significantly deteriorated. It now charges to only a max of 38000 mWh. The rating at the beginning was 74000 mWh. Which means about a 50% battery deterioration over 2.5 years. On battery, just typing documents and researching, gives still about 4 hrs. If you use battery saver, it can extend to 5-6 hrs. On battery for games is about 1 hr, but I suggest you plug it in for gaming, since it does not run games very well on battery.\n\nI also added 4 gb of RAM + and HDD. It was very easy. The laptop is very consumer friendly.\n\nI would recommend you get the newer model, since they changed to an IPS screen instead of the TN panel.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "Overall, I think this laptop is a great buy for the price.  I wanted a 15-inch computer so if I wanted to stick with a mac I'd be looking at $1,999 for the base macbook pro (which does not have a discrete grahics chip) or $2,499 for the model with a 2gb graphic chip.  This computer has all of the features I really want in a laptop for $799:\n1) Good screen resolution on a 15-inch screen (I can't see any pixels at a standard working distance and I have better than 20/20 vision) and the screen is bright\n2) Solid state drive.  It's on the smaller side, but the performance is well worth it.  I haven't timed it precisely, but its maybe 20 to 25 seconds from when I press the power button to when chrome is loaded and I'm browsing a web page.\n3) Newer i5 processor, 8gb ram, an ok discrete graphics chip\n4) extra hard drive slot & extra ram slot\n5) back-lit keyboard\n\nOn the neutral side of things:\n1) It doesn't have a optical disk drive, but I rarely use those and bought a ~$20 USB drive for those few times when I do need one.\n2) The track-pad is ok.  Useable, but not excellent  It supports multi-touch gestures which is nice and overall is useable and better than other windows track-pads I've used.  However, coming from a 6-yr old macbook pro it is definitely a step down.  The response is slow which may be the result of a sensitivity setting to discount accidental input - I haven't looked into that yet.  Another problem is that the set of gestures is limited.  I would *REALLY* like to set three finger swipes left/right to be internet back/forward. However, there is no option for this in the trackpad settings.  Apparently others have been able to solve this with updates, but I haven't gotten around to trying that.\n3) other reviewers have noted that the track-pad is off-center on the laptop and called this out as a problem.  I don't agree.  The pad is centered on the QWERTY keyboard, so it's centered between your hands while you're typing to minimize accidental input.  It is off-center because the keyboard has a full number pad\n\nThere ARE some issues however:\n1) As others have noted, there is light bleed along the bottom of the screen.  It isn't terrible and is not noticeable under most conditions.  However, it is visible when the screen is displaying a very dark image.\n2) The build quality definitely seems to be somewhat on the budget end of things.  In particular, the frame around the screen is somewhat flimsy compared to my old macbook pro and I'm a bit concerned about durability.  I'm also concerned that any pressure on the outside of the case would cause the keys to rub on the screen which would eventually leave marks.  I saved the foam sheet the computer shipped with and will use that to protect the screen when I travel with it."}

This laptop exceeds my expectations at this price point.\n\nIdeally, I would purchase&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/MSI-Computer-15-6-Inch-Laptop-GS60-GHOST-607-9S7-16H515-607/dp/B00YQNSEQ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">MSI Computer 15.6-Inch Laptop GS60 GHOST-607;9S7-16H515-607</a>, but for half the price, this laptop is nearly as good performance wise.  Dell really nailed it with regard to offering performance components in a laptop that is considerably less expensive than comparable configurations.  An SSD, NVIDIA GTX 960M w/4GB memory, an IPS screen, and a quality backlit keyboard, packed into a sturdy, portable build makes this an excellent bang for the buck.\n\nI ordered a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Samsung-850-EVO-250GB-2-5-Inch-SATA-III-Internal-SSD-MZ-75E250B-AM/dp/B00OAJ412U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Samsung 850 EVO 250GB 2.5-Inch SATA III Internal SSD (MZ-75E250B/AM)</a>&nbsp;and a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Kingston-Technology-8GB-1600MHz-DDR3L-PC3-12800-1-35V-Non-ECC-CL11-SODIMM-Intel-Laptop-Memory-KVR16LS11-8/dp/B00CQ35HBQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Kingston Technology 8GB 1600MHz DDR3L (PC3-12800) 1.35V Non-ECC CL11 SODIMM Intel Laptop Memory KVR16LS11/8</a>&nbsp;as well as a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Microsoft-Xbox-One-Controller-Wireless-Adapter-for-Windows-10/dp/B015IX3X3E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Microsoft Xbox One Controller + Wireless Adapter for Windows 10</a>&nbsp;to complete the gaming assembly.\n\nThe design of this laptop case makes it really easy to upgrade the components.  There is literally a single screw that holds the bottom cover on, and removing it allows you access to the battery, the drive bays, the wireless card, and the RAM.  I've never taken apart a laptop and added memory or an SSD before, but with this laptop I was able to put them both in within 5-10 minutes and have the cover back on.  So for about an extra $120 bucks, I was able to double my RAM and my storage capacity.\n\nI performed a fresh install of Windows 10, as I like to reclaim the drive space from Dell utilities/bloatware/back up partitions, downloaded the drivers from Dell's website, and I've been up and running with no issues since Christmas.  The Xbox One controller and wireless adapter work natively with Windows 10 without any driver downloads or installations, and my daughter has been lighting it up with goals in Rocket League on Steam.\n\nThe laptop stays cool, isn't too loud, and has yet to crash or give me problems.  The display is beautiful with great viewing angles, and I have no dead pixels.  There is slight backlight bleed across the bottom of the screen, but it's hardly noticeable, and it's not an issue for me.\n\nI would definitely recommend.  For under $900, I have a premium CPU (6th Gen Quad Core I5), a premium GPU that is capable of handling all modern day games (GTX 960M w/4GB video memory), a premium display (beautiful IPS panel), 16GB RAM, and two 250GB SSDs.  You will not find a similar or comparable configuration for less than a thousand bucks."}

But I've had at least half-a-dozen times where the screen (and with some relatively undemanding pdf or photo--I'm not using this computer for gaming) goes totally black and white, and I get some congratulatory message about how the graphics driver (I think?) has had an error and \"recovered.\" Also, it might be that I'm just not used to Dell trackpads, but the mouse reliably fails to select/highlight and delete/copy/cut/paste text in the way I've experienced it on all other Windows, and for that matter Macs. It highlights things, but doesn't respond to any command, one has to switch tabs and try again--irritating for a laptop this expensive.  (I keep wondering if the Function key is being held down or something, but no, the laptop just has a weird little way of handing text.)"}

The people who have left bad reviews must have had a defective item and they should return it asap, because the product I received works as intended-blazing fast.\n\nThe screen looks amazing. The back lit keys in the keyboard looks amazing for night use in dark areas of the house. The case of the laptop gets fingerprint marks left in it very easily which isn't attractive, but that's a small con. The mouse pad being located left of center works fine for me, although I'm not a big fan of the mousepad itself. The clicking actuation of it to left click and right click aren't as smooth and easy to perform as I'm use to. Also the mouse pad itself takes some getting use to, to get accurate with the mouse cursor on the monitor. The laptop runs very cool and even more silent, very very quiet! I love it. It handles PS cs6 with ease, especially since I upgraded the RAM to 16gb total with Kingston DDR3L RAM(which was very very easy). This isn't the lightest laptop but it is what it is. This is the best notebook you can buy right now for under $800!"}

It's been almost 3 months of usage.\nThe body is still solid, lovely access to internals with 1 screw only.\nBut .. here goes why the 3 stars.\n\nEverything was awesome in first month.\n1star down due to:\nNow I have a nice warm laptop in upper middle section (F5 to F12 area), but strangly the fans are not kicking in.  I guess I am few degrees off the limit.  Would be nice if there is Fan Always On option in BIOS, I have it on my HP. Yes its very quiet due to SSD and no Fans usage but it really gets warm like this. No need to be so passive with cooling.\nWhile gaming they kick in, never reached full blast and temp never went over 75C for both CPU and GPU. Nice.\nI know how the maxed fan sounds like. When you update the BIOS they kick in max just in case. While gaming .. not even close.  Tested with WoW, Borderlands 2, GTA 5 and few other smaller not so intensive games.\n\n2nd star down:\nThe speakers started to crackle on volumes above 50, really noticeable on vocals / covers songs. Not so much on music rich songs.\nBut REAAALLLYYY noticeable on movies since its mostly speech.\n\nand the biggest star down, but i won't take anymore just because its rated as \"I don't like it\". I do like it but quality is beyond poor.\nI have samsung evo 850 500gb sitting in my drawer for 2 MONTHS. why?  because i cannot plug it in.  my laptop was delivered without the tray/cradle and the connector cable to plug the 2.5inch drive. see attached pic.\n\nBeen contacting Dell many times. no parts can be found. don't care if its chargeable, i need the extra storage space to be used.\nso far i ordered 3 cables that fit the connector and that are from dell laptops, older inspirons. none of them work. but all 3 work on my brothers dell. how about that. one time i got lucky with dell rep. gave me part numbers but said they don't have it in stock, instead gave me link to order from 3rd party. I did. 29.99$. what happens? nada. zip. on top the part numbers that the rep. gave me, do not exist anywhere. tried with another rep. they said I have something wrong with the part number as they do not have that. oh well ...\n\nI would return it, but its way over return period. and not sure if I even want a replacement. with the comments i read about quality and screen bleed and other issues ...\n\nLast 3 days started to be fun.  Borderlands 2 is giving me artifacts ingame, object would just glow yellow/red/green with no texture. Had the same sign on my desktop before the GTX 860 died. looks like the memory for the GTX960 starts to fail.\n\nLets see how it will go in future ...\n\nUPDATE on 4th Month:\nas time passed i did some upgrades and fixes\n--added +8 GB Kingston Hyper X Black ram. no issues there, its all fine.\n--replaced the wifi card with Intel 7625 (2x2, AC, with 4.0 bluetooth). smooth as butter.  holding same signal strength but waaaaaay faster.\n--Had issue with the laptop with missing cradle + cable to connect the hard drive in 2.5inch bay.\n\nAs i got help from another user that also had it missing but returned and received new one with the cable, i managed to get the part number. Every other cable i tried it doesnt work even if its same connector. the laptop won't even power up.\n\nnow to get the correct cable in case yours is also missing but u like the laptop its Dell Part number HW01M. note its only the cable not the cradle. As I added another 500GB samsung evo 850 SSD there, i just fixed in in place with some 3Ms :)\n\nAfrifacts disapeared after upgrading from bios version 1.1.3 to 1.1.5. not sure how its related. but meh, worth mentioning.\n\nAlso, if u use samsung ssd evo or pro, PLEASE do yourself a favor and clone the windows on that drive, or even better just reinstall everything.  the performance (IOPS) for the samsung vs the sandisk are more than double with even faster data rates. the laptop is even faster since i did that.\n\nLets see how it will go now that i consider to be the final build."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "So I have owned this laptop for almost 5 months now and wanted to give my long term review for it.\n\nThe build quality of this laptop has been holding up really good thus far, with the rubberized coating not wearing off, but it still retains oils from fingerprints. It hasn't shown any signs of scratching or anything like that, which is good (although since this laptop is black, it might hide scratches and nicks better than white.)\n\nThe specs have still held up very well, and the ssd still making this thing ridiculously fast. The graphics card is still holding up good, it will still play games really well (haven't tried any big name games but older ones like TF2 play like a charm.) All while still staying silent, not while gaming, but when doing normal everyday tasks.\n\nThe keyboard is still just OK, the space bar doesn't have the double space nearly as often anymore after being worn in after a while, the touchpad is alright, it isn't the best but far from the worst, and just thought I throw this in there, after a while, the hinge isn't as stiff to open or close.\n\nI still recommend this laptop to someone who needs a decent gaming laptop but doesn't want to break the bank with something like an Alienware or an Asus ROG, I don't know about everyone elses laptop, but mine has a 2 year warranty out of the box also.\n\nI just got this laptop and set it up, and so far it's excellent. It boots up quickly and runs all my programs fast. The only minor thing is that you can see some backlight bleed around the edge of the display, but it's only noticeable when I boot it up. I will update the review on the weeks to come.\n\nUpdate #1: I have been using this laptop for about 8 hours, and I want to add my first impression.\nThe SSD in this laptop make this thing lightning quick to start up and to launch programs. The screen does appear to be IPS, it does have good colors and the blacks are decent, but like I mentioned above, does have some backlight  but this is no big issue for me.  What I do notice that worries me is that when I open and close the screen I can see some stress occur on the panel. I don't know if this is my unit or if this is a common problem, my concern is that with enough bending I feel like I can break the screen, but that might just be me.\n\nThe keyboard is excellent, most people say it's OK, but I love it,  and it's backlit. So for people that type in the dark don't have to rely on another light source for the keyboard.\n\nThe trackpad is OK. It does have a slight texture on it, but my unit has a slight rattle to it. Although it isn't horrible to use, the one thing that  baffles me is that when you scroll, it's inverted. When you go down, it goes up and vice versa. I don't get why Dell did that.\n\nThe processor is excellent and will get most task done with relative ease. I haven't had it stump on me when doing regular task like watching videos or typing this review to things like gaming.\n\nSpeaking of gaming, it does it a treat. Although I only really have 2 games on it at the moment, I have used them as a benchmark to test out the GPU.\n\nOne of those games if Minecraft, something that is pretty popular. This one is interesting, as when I went into the game and put on the information screen that tells me what version the game is etc etc. The graphics driver it was using was the integrated graphics. It still ran at a solid 60 fps, and forcing the dedicated card didn't do much better.\n\nAnother game that I used and is less well known, is Euro Truck Simulator 2. And paying that on ultra settings was doable at around 40-50 fps, but I left it in high settings and easily pulled a solid 60 fps.\n\nIt's too early to comment on the battery life of this laptop, and I will comment on it later.\n\nAnd just a few side notes on this laptop are the speakers get really loud, although at high volumes, there is some noticeable distortion going on. And this thing is really quiet!!!! When doing normal work loads like watching a video, the  fans don't even turn on. And when gaming, they will but there not that loud unless you are in a library.\n\nSo far, this is an excellent laptop for the $800, and I will keep the 5 start rating for now unless something starts to bother me, this review should be updated in the days to come.\n\nUpdate #2: I have had some more time with this laptop and want to share some more thoughts about it\n\n-There is a minor annoyance with the space bar if my unit. When hitting it from the right side, it will respond when I am typing, but it will insert a double space, which if you have to do writing and you don't have the time to correct it, than it could really annoy you. But this could be only my unit.\n\n-The performance of this is still excellent, it boots up quickly and running programs is still a breeze\n\n-The battery life is really good so far, still can't comment on the time, and the system still runs very quiet\n\nI am still giving the laptop 5 stars"}

I have owned three lenovo thinkpads and they never leave finger prints.  It does make it look kind of messy on the outside and they are very difficult to wipe off.  It runs all the games I have tried without any problem and it is very fast .....I recommend it.  Very nice lighted keyboard.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "It's too early to tell, but we had to request a replacement computer because of what appears to be a motherboard/power supply failure (my first review gave this laptop one star, since been updated to five).  I plugged the external power supply in the wall and then the round connector into the computer case and immediately heard two small pops (like small firecrackers), at which time the external power supply overloaded and shut down.  I unplugged the external supply from the wall (to reset it) and plugged it back in. I re-inserted the round plug into the computer and again, the external supply shut down. I do not understand why this happened and wonder if this unit was ever QA tested. The replacement has been shipped and I hope there are no issues.\n\nUpdate on this order:  We received the replacement and it functions without any issue. The return process was great - Amazon sent the replacement immediately upon me submitting a return order, so the new one and the replacement crossed in the mail.  This laptop is a good one and I would buy it again.  I added another 8GB of RAM without problems and will add another hard drive (there is a nice little bay for a 2.5 drive under the cover on the bottom). The experience started out kind of stressful, but in the end everything was fine for which I give Amazon a lot of credit.  I don't suppose I would have gotten the same replacement and service had I bought this from a local box store."}

This machine performs better (thanks to the quad core, ssd, and discrete NVIDIA gfx) than the Core i7 6500u units I tested; honestly, the SSD makes a big difference. It was a trade off as the 2-in-1 and laptops failed to impress. If you want to go that direction, you're better off looking into the Surface/Surface Pro lineup.\n\n*Note that I received my laptop from the Amazon Warehouse deals and I got lucky receiving a unit that was untouched and still in original packaging."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "I received this laptop just this week and I have had a mixed bag of thoughts on this. Overall, for the price, I will say that I thoroughly enjoy this laptop. I find it to be a little cheap in quality and it seems to be a little glitchy but definitely worth the price.\n\nI am switching from a 2012 15\" Retina Macbook Pro. My last laptop had great specs but one thing that I feel is that my last laptop was extremely responsive, where this one is not as responsive. The total system startup is very nice but background processes continue to run making programs upon the initial screen slightly slow to startup (even with the SSD). This is not problematic but this is my review to the best of my experience.\n\nStartup and Programs - The laptop is extremely snappy once it has been booted. There is sometimes a tad bit of system lag but that does not stop the laptop from running nicely. Overall I would say that most of the programs I have run have been very smooth once they have been started. Just the initial startup of each program can take a few seconds. 8/10\n\nThe Body - The body is made of a cheaper rubberized plastic material. There is a point in the middle of the screen that from the lid of the laptop, you feel as if it is definitely flimsier and I do appear to have some points where the light is bleeding from the bottom of the screen. The feel is nice though. It definitely looks like a gaming laptop with the red accents. I overall, really like the look and feel though. The underside of the laptop is easily accessible with one screw that opens the door to the back access of the laptop. 7/10\n\nInside - Upon opening the laptop you are greeted with a M.2 SSD 256GB stick (average read/write speeds of 512-540). As well there is a single 8GB ram stick that is set in the dual opening slot leaving it accessible for another 8GB stick. The laptop also has a tiny sub woofer that really.... does not sound good. It comes with a 74 WHr battery that I have gotten the Dell quoted 10 hours out of (with some system tweaking). This model also has an extra slot for a full 2.5\" HD/SSD which I quickly placed a 7200 RPM 500GB in (Works perfectly after the drive was formatted). 9/10\n\nScreen - The screen just doesn't do it for me. I find myself gaming on my tv like its a console because the matte screen (though full HD) just doesn't do it for me. It does a very nice job removing glare but the colors all seem kinda dark and faded out from what they should be. Overall the screen is not that great. 7/10\n\nTrackpad - This is another area where the laptop suffers. The trackpad is just not that responsive. I have fixed this a little by tweaking some settings but its still fairly unresponsive. The other part is that it has a slight bounce that feels cheap and flimsy. The buttons are also weird to use because of the positioning of the mousepad on the laptop. I find myself typing with my left hand and moving the mouse with my right and hitting the left mouse button a lot when im trying to hit the right (and vice versa). Definitely would be nicer with a mouse. 3/10\n\nSound - This laptop comes with a sub-woofer mounted on the bottom. I will say.... I am not impressed with what Dell has done. These speakers are actually really nice but out of the box I found my speakers crackling from music. Another weird thing is that when I fullscreen videos, I find it crackles more. The stock Dell software thats included.... A definite no go. It makes the music much louder than the original Microsoft sound drivers but its not a good louder. 5/10\n\nGaming - So, I do not game as hardcore as some people do. My attempts are at GTA 5 and Fallout (New Vegas) so far. In GTA 5 with the settings maxed, I have found myself getting 42-47 frames per second staying closer to 47. In older games like New Vegas, I have not dropped from 60. It remains at the absolute highest settings and has not gone below it once. As well the system does such a nice job keeping it cool that I can hardly ever recognize that the fans went on. In most of my experience so far, they haven't had to turn on which is nice too. The ventilation in the bottom panel leaves plenty of room for air to flow through keeping it nice and cool. Though I am not a huge gamer..... I find this laptop to totally exceed my expectations. 9/10\n\nWhile it may sound like I do not like this laptop and I will admit, I do find some flaws with this laptop..... I absolutely love the design and look of it. Its very sleek and it is spec'd out GREAT with what it has to offer for the price. It is flimsier than I would like but im surprised that they would include a quad core i5 (totally makes this laptop amazing with the Skylake Processor) but this computer is totally worth the $800 that Dell is selling it for. If you can find it for under $700, I would strongly suggest you get one. I was afraid of my switch to PC (after 10 years) that I was not going to like it but I frickin love this laptop. Overall on a rating I would give this laptop with cost and everything added in a 8/10. Seriously thought I was going to be hesitant but this will be my primary laptop for the next few years. :)"}

The touchpad was loose which was an annoying start, but I was able to quickly look past it until the wireless card just stopped working. I had already gotten onto the internet when it cut off. At first I thought I had accidentally pressed the Wi-Fi button but that was not the case. The wireless card was disabled, and I tried everything to re-enable it but to no avail. Not to mention, there was no audio.\n\nI used to be a HUGE fan of Dell, but after this purchase (which will no doubt be returned) I am going to have to find a new brand.\n\nThere is a reason that this laptop is relatively cheap for the specs it has. Spare yourself and don't get it."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "I purchased the i7559 after looking at several options. I'm not a gamer, but I loved the specs.  Before I fired it up, I added and additional 8GB's of RAM for a total of 16GB. I also added an additional 250GB SSD Drive. Both upgrades were easy. Remove one screw on the back of the unit and everything is there for you! There was even a cable connector for the additional drive bay. The memory popped in without a hitch. Finally I added the external Dell optical drive.\n\nThe speed at which this machine boots up at is astounding! I've had it for a couple of weeks now and I can't think of ONE thing that has been an issue. TOTALLY HAPPY with the machine. BTW, the backlit keyboard is one feature I'm glad is included. I was going to choose another machine that did not have the backlit keyboard and I'm glad I didn't.\n\nI don't think ANYONE can go wrong with this laptop given the features it comes with and then if you kick it up a notch...it's even better! Buy it and you won't regret it. I did research for a month before deciding on this one and again, I'd buy it again."}

Very fancy red and black.\n\nThe 960m graphics chip it has in it is not very good concerning price performance. It's good for laptops, however if you want to play games you should just buy a desktop.\n\nThe SSD is deceptively small. I had it for 2 weeks and already filled it up 60%  You definitely need an external harddrive.\n\nThe keyboard and back lighting and touch pad are all nice.\n\nThe screen is 1080p it looks great.\n\nGreat battery life.\n\nThe processor is rather weak and mine never turbod to 3.2 ghz like the description says. The max was 2.7 ghz. Dont expect amazing speed when running applications.\n\nWindows 10 is really cool I don't think I'll ever go back to windows 7.\n\nOverall I Recommend this product for someone who is looking for a portable gaming machine. If you really want a gaming laptop then this is probably the best purchase. However, overall I reccomend a gaming pc because its much better price/performance and why would you want to leave the house and game anyway?"}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "Pros:\n1) Powerful graphics. The laptop will handle almost any game at, or near, maximum settings.\n2) Easy to upgrade. From the factory, the laptop has an extra RAM slot and hard drive bay. Only one screw must be removed to access them.\n3) Very strong battery life. With just web browsing and some light video watching, you can get 7-8 hours out of the battery. Mix in some gaming, and you can still push 5 hours. Really impressive battery life.\n4) Speakers. The speakers and sub are excellent for a laptop - it even has something close to real bass. Movies and games sound great, I don't feel a need to wear my headphones.\n5) Cooling system. The laptop does not heat up much at all. In fact, compared to older gaming laptops that I have had, this one is positively cool. Also, it's almost entirely silent. Even when gaming. Really excellent heat control system.\n\nCons:\n1) Problems with the network card and drivers. The network card drops signal, and sometimes throttles bandwidth. It's finicky and I don't like it. It's so bad that I'm considering returning the laptop. I'm going to give it a few more days and see how it holds up before I get a replacement or just buy a different brand.\n2) Screen. It's not a bad screen, but it could be a lot better. There is some bleeding at the bottom when the screen is black and, because of the ratio, some text and images can appear blurry. That said, it is an IPS panel so viewing angles are excellent and games look good and clean.\n3) Bugs. For starters - the computer likes to freeze intermittently after it is woken from hibernation. This is very annoying. However, because the SSD is so quick, it's not too much of a pain to shut the computer down every time you are finished using it. Still, though - it's a blatant problem that Dell should have ironed out in QA testing before this machine was ever put on the market.\n\nOverall:\n\nThe laptop is very fast, has great specs, and can handling borderline hardcore gaming. It's a good size and feels relatively well built. I really like the battery life and the cooling system. It has some issues, the network card particularly, that make me worry. That said, I am still happy with the purchase. I feel like I did get my money's worth, and then some. I hope that this computer helps set the trend for affordable gaming laptops in the future.\n\nI hope this review helps!\n\nCheers,\nRd"}

The only problem that I've seen (which does not both me) is that I can see a little light bleed on the bottom of the screen, though this is only when the screen is completely black, such as in start up.

I went to the Intel site and downloaded the most current drivers from there and it is now stable and functional.\n\nIt is great having a very fast booting system with the SSD.. As others have also pointed out, it is nice having the ability to mount a drive in the second bay.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "Works very well, running most games at 1080p with med/high graphics, not too much bloatware compared to companies like HP but I would still prefer it to have none.  Other users mentioned that there were frequent connectivity issues due to a driver issue, I haven't encountered any but my purchase was an amazon warehouse deal so maybe the previous owner already went through the trouble of updating everything.  Other users also mentioned the audio being a little strange and I noticed that there was an audible echo when I was listening to people speak over skype, I checked dell audio and sure enough there was some sort of audio \"enhancement\" that was the culprit.  Screen brightness  is adequate for indoor use and there is some visible bleedthrough on the bottom portion of the screen but nothing deal breaking.  I prefer a glossy type screen but the matte anti-glare screen on this seems fine, color reproduction seems mostly accurate, nothing too washed out nor over saturated to death.  Keyboard feels a little mushy compared to what I'm used to, but it's functional.  As most other users have noted the touchpad seems to be the weakest part of the deal, I fiddled around a little with the driver's software and got something mostly useful out of it."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "Absolutely incredible computer for the price. I would strongly recommend this computer to anyone interested in gaming or in just having a super fast computer. The SSD makes everything run incredibly fast; I updated from an 8 year old Dell Vostro 1700, so the change in speed and quality was dramatic to say the least.\n\nAs far as gaming goes, I downloaded the Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, and this little laptop handled the game on Ultra settings, with only one or two barely noticeable dips in the frame rate on some of the more graphically taxing cut scenes. I switched to High settings, and since I am not really a PC gaming snob, I honestly can't tell a difference in the visual quality of the game, and the computer is able to run it no problem. If it can handle a new game like Witcher 3 so well, I would trust this laptop to handle any game on the market right now.\n\nI cannot stress enough how impressed I am with the speed and quality of this laptop, but I was also wowed by how quiet the thing is. The fan on it does a great job of keeping the whole thing cool, even during extended gaming sessions, and yet it is so quiet, I actually held my hand underneath to feel if the fan was even running.\n\nNo computer is perfect, however. I did encounter a small problem in the initial setup where I was unable to download any files at all. I was trying to download the current drivers, as well as download Chrome, and I kept receiving an error that said something like \"Unable to complete action, contact app distributor\" (I don't remember the exact wording). I was very frustrated and scared that I had gotten a lemon. Then, I tried again later, and just like that, the error was gone and everything downloaded perfectly fine. I still don't know what that was all about, and it did make me a little concerned. But whatever it was seems not to be a problem anymore, and the computer has performed so well with not a single problem since that first day that I am not worried.\n\nThe biggest problem with the computer is the trackpad. It is horrible. This is the absolute WORST trackpad I have ever used in my life. A complete waste of space on an otherwise amazing computer. If you buy this computer, make sure to pick up a wireless mouse. I got this one for $9, and it works great.&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/TeckNet-reg-Pro-2-4G-Wireless-Mouse-2400-DPI-3-Adjustment-Levels-24-Month-Battery-Life-6-Buttons-Nano-Receiver/dp/B013WJRG5C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">TeckNet&reg; Pro 2.4G Wireless Mouse, 2400 DPI, 3 Adjustment Levels, 24 Month Battery Life, 6 Buttons,Nano Receiver</a>\n\nYou probably also want to pick up a cheap Xbox 360 controller for Windows if you are planning to play games on here. I am not a fan of the keyboard and mouse setup anyway, but it seems like this keyboard especially would not lend itself well to playing games.\n\nThe only other \"complaint\" (and I can't even really complain about this considering the price of this computer) is that the SSD at 256 GB is pretty small, especially if you want to play a lot of games. The Witcher 3 alone ate up 35 GB! I am only interested in playing a couple of games, so it's no problem for me, but if you are a hardcore gamer, you will want to invest in some more storage space. But if you are a hardcore gamer, you probably already know that.\n\nIn conclusion, I would definitely recommend this computer if you want a relatively cheap, but SUPER FAST computer capable of playing the latest graphically advanced games. The SSD on this thing makes every program open right up and run efficiently; boot-up times are lightning fast. The minor flaws mentioned here are nothing compared to the overall quality of this computer. Especially if you are looking to upgrade from an old computer like I was, this is a great one to buy!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "I wanted a 1080p Skylake laptop with a 4GB video card and an SSD. There are very few available for under $1000, let alone one for $699 (I purchased a returned model from Amazon Warehouse). My expectations for fit and finish were very low.\n\nThat said, it's a well built machine with high quality components. It arrived in pristine shape. True to the other reviews, the trackpad was not great (it feels wobbly and tracks poorly) and there were wireless issues. I also had a system crash that had me on the phone with customer service for an hour.\n\nLong story short, I used the Windows Media Creation Tool to create an image on a USB stick and loaded a clean version of Windows. I updated the necessary drivers and updated the BIOS. Everything seemed fine, but I had the reported problem of the computer screen getting stuck coming out of sleep, but was able to fix it by updating the Intel 530 graphics driver from the Device Manager.\n\nAfter a few hours of headache, I now have a solid gaming machine.\n\nPROS:\nGreat graphics card - can run Tomb Raider and Skyrim smoothly on max settings\nSolid speakers - easily the loudest laptop speakers I've ever had. Not a substitute for external speakers, but they fill a room\nGood screen - I like matte screens. I don't think the colors are super accurate, but they are pleasing\nQuiet - I was worried that the fans would be noisy, but when they kick on during gaming, they aren't at all intrusive\nDecent keyboard - I was worried after reading a couple reviews, but I can type quickly on it and it's very quiet\nEasy upgrades - It took 45 seconds to double the RAM. One-screw access to upgrade memory or add a 2.5\" SSD\nSSD - Boots in seconds, completely silent\nDecent design - I like the understated looks of it. It doesn't have crazy cooling vents or wild color schemes.\nBattery life - I haven't pushed it, but as far as I can tell, it lasts a lot longer than my work Macbook Pro.\n\nCONS:\nPain in the butt setup - It took a modicum of technical know-how and a few hours to get it working smoothly\nHeavy-ish - It's to be expected with this class of video card. It's not gargantuan; only compared to the recent trend in skinny notebooks\nText display - Text displays a bit fuzzy. A minor annoyance.\nScreen brightness - Only average.\nAverage build quality - It's solidly built, but the screen hinge has some give and the bottom accessory panel feels flimsy. Otherwise great.\n\nSUMMARY:\nOnce you get it set up correctly, it's a fantastic machine for a great price. I wanted a solid work computer that had some gaming horsepower, and this model delivers. If you buy one, before you do anything, install a clean version of Windows and all the Dell driver/BIOS updates. Had I done that first, I'd have saved two hours of cursing and dealing with (slow, but helpful) customer service."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "The last time I bought a new computer was in May of 2010 so I figured that it was time to get a new one. I wanted one that would last me for another ~5 years or so and also be decent for gaming. I searched all the budget gaming laptops and this one by far has the best specs for the price. Quad core SKYLAKE processor, 8GB ram (easily and cheaply upgradable), 256GB SSD (also easily and cheaply upgradable), IPS 15\" screen, solid video card with 4GB of GDDR5 ram, NO optical drive and it has all the latest USB 3.0 and bluetooth ports on it.\n\nIt's fast, it's quiet (in the limited gaming I have done), the build quality is solid, it works great.\n\nThere are a few niggling issues though:\n\n1 - Built in drivers are out of date. You have to go into the device manager and manually update all the drivers for everything on the computer. A pain in the butt but it didn't take that long.\n2 - Touchpad is garbage. Seriously this is the worst touchpad I've ever used. Luckily I use an external mouse all the time but I would not be happy if I was using that touchpad on a regular basis.\n3 - Ugly colors. The red color scheme that they use is really ugly IMO. I guess they were going after that Alienware market?\n4 - Windows 10 is a mixed bag. It's faster than 7 but still kind of buggy. Cortana is also kind of dumb.\n5 - Dell installs some bloatware. Not a huge deal but there is some bloatware installed on the computer, some from Dell and some from Microsoft so you have to go and uninstall all of that too.\n6 - It's a bit big and heavy but this can't be helped really since it is a 15\" laptop with a QUAD core processor and good video car, so this is more of an observation than a negative. However it is lighter and thinner than my old 15\" laptop from 5 years ago.\n\nOverall though it is a great computer and I would recommend it for anyone who wants a new 15\" laptop with medium-high specs and doesn't want to break the bank."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "My Dell Inspiron i7559-763BLK arrived on Tuesday, December 15th. Its a Christmas present for my son who will be going off to college next year and wanted a PC for school work and light gaming (Hearthstone mostly). The price, hardware, and reviews were what sold me on this laptop.\nIm very PC savvy so I took control of unboxing it and prepping it for use.\n\nAfter turning on, the first thing that I noticed is that the wifi was connected but continued to show as being disabled. Enabling did not change the status. Having read the reviews on here, I went to device manager and did an internet search to update the driver. Problem solved. Wi-fi works as it should.\n\nI added some software that I like such as Classic Shell to give the classic windows start menu and CCleaner so I could delete some of the bloatware apps and programs that came pre-installed. I didn't want to install too many programs right now due to adding a SSD data drive (more on that coming up). Once complete, I turned off and removed the one screw on the bottom of the unit and opened it up.\n\nIts almost too easy to get inside. I almost wish it had 4 screws at each corner rather than the 1 screw and clips securing the panel. 1 screw for the entire bottom panel seems to be too little. I added 8 GB of RAM that I bought with the laptop that was listed as part of the package that Amazon sold together. Its the Kingston Technology 8GB 1600MHz DDR3L (PC3-12800) 1.35V Non-ECC CL11 SODIMM Intel Laptop Memory KVR16LS11/8. Its not identical to the pre-installed stick but that won't matter. That went easily enough and, upon restart, a BIOS message did come up saying that the amount of installed memory had changed and if I did not install more memory that I needed to reseed the memory stick.  Just ignored that and the laptop now shows 16 GB of installed RAM.\n\nI also had a 960 GB SanDisk Ultra II 2.5 7mm SSD that I installed in the spare drive bay that I will use as a data drive. This isn't so easy to do manly due to my man hands. The good thing is that there already is a screwed-in bracket waiting for you to use. Just unscrew the 4 extremely tiny screws then remove the bracket, use 4 screws that you must have already to secure the SSD to the bracket, connect the SATA cable then screw the bracket onto the SSD, pop back in and re-install the 4 tiny screws. The issue here, however, is twofold: First, you are not provided with the 4 screws to secure the SSD to the bracket. Im lucky to have a ton of screws from prior purchases but most people wont. Secondly, the space for the SSD is sooo tight that one of the 4 screws securing the SSD to the bracket was bumping up against the side panel and not allowing the SSD to seed flush any longer. I had to remove 1 screw and go with just 3 screws holding the SSD to the bracket. This shouldnt pose any future issues as its secure enough. Even just securing 2 of the 4 screws at a diagonal is enough to keep the SSD secure.\n\nOnce you turn on the laptop after the SSD install you will not be able to see the SSD listed as a storage device. You must first go into disk management (simply do a search for disk management in the search box). There you can click on the storage device and assign a letter to the drive (I chose D as my 960 GB SSD data drive but you can assign a different drive letter). Click OK and now your extra storage device is ready to go. It was already TRIM enabled by default so no need to manually turn that on.\n\nInstalling a typical HDD will be identical to the install of my SDD.\n\nAfter the SDD install, I installed IOBit Driver Booster 3 and was surprised to see that 17 drivers were outdated. Most of the new drivers had been released in September 2015. I updated those and also used the Dell System Detect to direct me to the most current BIOS update (dated November 2015) and updated the BIOS. I then proceeded to do a Windows Update and install the big November Windows 10 update. That went smoothly.\n\nI installed Diablo 3 and was very surprised at how well it ran on max settings. It looked gorgeous. The sound is tinny as you might expect from limited laptop speakers but the graphics are awesome. No stutter. I didn't check the FPS but it was so smooth.\n\nI also installed ChrisPC Win Experience Index and it computed the following after the RAM upgrade and SSD install (on a scale from 1 to 9.9):\nProcessor:  7.8\nMemory (RAM):  7.8\nGraphics (built in): 6.2\nGraphics (Nvidia): 9.9\nPrimary Hard Drive: 8.2\n\nIn comparison my desktop gaming PC scored 8.0, 8.0, 8.5, 9.9 and 8.1 in those categories. Specs are i7 4th gen processor, 24 GB RAM, 2 Nvidia 760 GTX GPUs in SLI,  SSD OS primary drive and SSD secondary data drive.\n\nThe keyboard is adequate and comparable to other laptops I have used. I use a mouse so no comments that I can give regarding the touchpad.\n\nThe construction is my only concern as my son will be mobile with this laptop and hauling it around at school in his backpack. A lot of plastic on this baby. Only time will tell if it will hold up to a beating but I did buy the extended 3 year warranty that Amazon was selling with the laptop through Canopy.\n\nI think that for the price this is a great purchase and, with the upgrades I made, will be future-proof for until it breaks."}

It's not overly noticable once you reduce the red and green intensity when calibrating the screen though)\n\nThings I'm iffy about:\nThese speakers don't sound terrible, but never ever use the stock presets on MaxxAudio. They just make the laptop sound terrible.\nThe backlit keyboard. It's not terrible, but I wish they paid more attention to where they're putting the lights so that it doesn't shine through the corners of the keys. It's weird to look at, but definitely better than having no backlight at all.\n\nThings I love:\ni5 quad core is very efficient and powerful, leaps and bounds better than it's dual core hyperthreaded variant (i5 6300U)\nGTX 960M handles the games I play very nicely with v-sync turned on in some games like StarCraft 2\nThe battery is HUGE and lasts a very long time doing web browsing and non intensive things. I haven't managed to kill it as yet.\nThe cooling system. 2 fans. I was used to hitting 90+ degrees per core on my old laptop, but this one only gets to about 70 per core, and it NEVER gets hot to the hand, so the cooling has to be the #1 thing I love about this laptop.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "Amazing laptop and wonderful upgrade from my previous Toshiba. Perfect if you're a college student on a budget like I am.\n\nThe laptop boots up in under 10 seconds. It runs Fallout 4 at a very smooth 60 FPS on medium settings, godrays off and textures on ultra. It also runs Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege without a stutter. It doesn't get hot when running these games either.\n\nOne thing: Make sure that you update all of the drivers out of the box for optimal performance. I had to directly go to the Dell website and manually type in my model number because it couldn't detect my software, but once I downloaded all of the drivers it worked well.\nI had a temporary problem with Skype because it couldn't detect my microphone, but updating the audio driver again fixed the problem.\n\nAs for the track pad, it is not ideal, but it's not the worst one I've ever used. It's definitely usable but I would recommend using a mouse if you have access to one. The keyboard is very comfortable and easy to type on, so if you need to use it for school for writing essays or the like then it would be a good choice.\nCurrently I have not added another SSD, but I plan to in the future. Other reviews have said that installation is easy and that the back only has one screw holding it, so I don't expect that to be an issue.\nThe laptop is made of plastic and other reviews have said that they don't think it's built very well, but I disagree. I like that it's made of soft, matte plastic. It does gather prints, but it's fairly easy to clean. It does have a bit of heft to it, but I find that this makes it feel more solid and durable, and it's not even very heavy. I also like the fact that it doesn't look like a gaming laptop. The red accents look very nice, and although the back lit keyboard is white, not red, it looks very sleek. The charger, when plugged in, glows blue. I have to say it would've been nice if it glowed white to match the keyboard, but this is in no way a deal breaker.\n\nI highly recommend this laptop to anyone looking for a good gaming laptop, or a good laptop in general, and is on a budget. I was looking for gaming laptops and I researched for over a month before deciding on this one. These are great specs for the price. At $800, this can't be beat."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "I would say I'm above average when it comes to understanding computers and the laptop is nice for the price. Reading a lot of the reviews before purchasing, I already expected some of the downsides that others have posted and calculated those into whether or not I still wanted to buy the laptop. I choose to go ahead and make the purchase and I would be lying if I said i didn't kind of regret my purchase.\n\nPros: It looks nice (got a lot of compliments at the college I attend), doesn't get to hot, the feel of the keys are not bad rubbery though (I own a mechanical keyboard and it's not as good but for a laptop not bad),\n\nCons: the \"i\" key comes loose all the time after 2 months and it isn't even my primary computer(i don't type on the keys a lot). The other keys feel good though so it could just be bad luck on my part. The screen crashes pretty frequently, but I expect this to be fixed by an update ( not really a big deal yet. I just reload the pages and they comeback but definitely an annoyance.\n\nOverall it was an okay purchase. The biggest thing that made me take off a star was the \"i\" key constantly coming off (I can just push the key back in but it will still come loose after a couple of presses.) I would recommend it to someone else, just wouldn't recommend the laptop in my possession to someone else."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "I've owned the laptop for several weeks, and I'm not disappointed in a single thing regarding the hardware.\nThe Display is CRISP, colorful, anti-glare. The processor's performance is negligible from an i7. It had an extra RAM slot and empty sata slot for an extra hard drive (which is easily accessible with removing one screw). The built in SSD is FAST which means fast booting, and fast program launching. The keyboard and trackpad are both very premium, especially coming from using other laptops and macbooks, be sure to look in the settings for built in gestures. The speakers are....great for a laptop, obviously nothing special, gets very loud and has a ton of neat features with Dell Audio if you're nitpicky about sound and plan on using headphones. The laptop itself is gorgeous, soft touch, black/red grills & accents look sweet.\n I give it an extra point for having a solid display hinge that DOESN'T lift the laptop when bringing it up like most value PC's do.\nThe lack of a DVD drive/vga port is AWESOME, I literally never use either of those, and glad the laptop saved some space ridding those.\nThe battery life is FANTASTIC for a gaming PC, easily pull 5-10 hours depending on the use.\n\nI use this laptop for gaming AND Adobe Creative Cloud. This laptop breezes through programs like Photoshop, Premeire, After Effects, Muse, Illustrator, and Lightroom.\n\nIronically the only issue I've been having is with Nvidias latest driver, it causes issues with Rocket league and sometimes freezes up for several seconds in normal use. These can all be fixed by rolling back to the Driver originally shipped with the laptop.\n\nObviously I Highly recommend this laptop for gaming as it pulls off higher graphical settings and resolutions on par with the PS4 with frame rates equivalent if not higher than the PS4.\nEG. 30fps on Fallout 4 Max Settings at 1080P\nRocket League 1080P Max Settings solid 60FPS\nMortal Kombat X 1080p High Settings 60FPS\nBatman Arkham Knight 1080P High settings w/Enhanced Rain+Light shafts 30FPS\n\nThe laptop has yet to exceed 70C also, which is phenomenal for a gaming laptop this size. This may have to do with the 2 built in rubber stands under the laptop that elevate it, increasing airflow.\n\nI recommend setting your Nvidia card to \"Maximum Performance\" in the Nvidia Control panel and charging while gaming for the best results."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "This is a review as well as an opportunity for me to ask some questions, which I hope would get better answers in the comments section than in \"Customer Questions & Answers\".\n\nI've had it for two weeks now.  Overall it's a very solid laptop.  I don't really game, and mainly got this to do office work, so in a sense it's an overkill, but the deal is good, and the specs are spectacular.  I'll keep it simple, and divide the reviews to pros, cons, neutrals / undecided, and questions.\n\nPros:\n- Speed:  It's a fast computer.  Startup is in seconds, and waking up is almost instantaneous.  Basic everyday work a normal person performs on a laptop, e.g. browsing, viewing videos, office work, etc. happens with blazing speed.  Very occasionally there's a slight lag (with \"program not responding\" notification in the title bar) when opening HWMonitor, which tracks stuff like temp, but I suspect that's a one off.\n- Value:  I think it goes without saying, but you can't find a better laptop for the money.\n- Upgrading Ease:  The back panels opens by unscrewing only one screw, and even a novice like me was able to add 8 GB of RAM easily.  I plan to add a second SSD soon.\n- Speaker:  I'm no laptop audiophile, but the speaker has good volume to say the least.\n- Lack of Bloatware:  I think only some Dell stuff and McAfee come with.  I did a clean install with Windows 10 Enterprise, and I suggest a clean install for everyone, just to be safe.\n- Lack of Dell Root Cert:  Unless I got a used laptop, and someone else already removed it... No Dell Root Cert found on this machine.\n\nCons:\n- Weight:  It's on the heavy - side for a 15.6\" laptop.  Not sure if the specs warrant the heaviness, but don't buy the laptop for portability.\n- Fingerprints:  Honestly, I think most laptops show fingerprints easily, so maybe it's symptomatic to all laptops.\n- Slight Imperfection on Top Panel:  Upon arrival, on the top panel (back of LCD), there is a very slight nick, as if someone used a very thin needle and poked the panel at one spot.  It's very noticeable to the touch, but mot much so to the eye (although you can see it.  I might upload a photo later, at work right now).  Doesn't bother me too much though, and it's obviously just my machine that has the issue.\n\nNeutrals / Undecided:\n- Track Pad:  I see why some may find the texture and location of the track pad bothersome, but I personally have used it without issues.  Occasionally I feel like it doesn't register a tap as a left - click, but that could be me rather than the track pad.\n- Keyboard:  It's okay.  I'm not too particular on keyboards.  No sounds when you type.\n- Build:  It's plastic, so just know what you're getting, but overall it looks / feels more sturdy than not, in part due to the heft.\n- Battery life:  I haven't done a comprehensive testing, but I'm getting about 1 hr per 10% battery drain (100% to 90%, etc.) from basic browsing with lowish (but not lowest) dimness.  However, even when playing a very basic game like Dominion online, battery life is under 3 hours.  So I suspect you can get 8+ hours from very basic use, but not much at all when gaming.  I will say, I did a test against my girlfriend's newly bought ASUS K501UX with a lower - capacity battery, where we turned off the screen and continuously played YouTube videos without volume.  In about 3 hours, this Dell drained to 77%, however her Asus only drained to 81%.  That did cause me some concern, so if anyone has any comments on that, I'd appreciate it very much!\n- Heat:  I've never had it get \"hot\", but it does get noticeably warm even from basic use on the table.  I think it's more than lukewarm, but it's not \"hot\" by anyone's standards I don't think.  Again, my girlfriend's Asus does MUCH better in this sense, where the Asus never gets more than lukewarm.  From HWMonitor, the CPU temp hovers from 40 - 50 Celsius from basic usage (sometimes lower, and occasionally higher), and can get above 50 from basic gaming like Dominion online (although it doesn't necessarily stay above 50).  I think with heavier gaming, it has the \"potential\" to get \"hot\", but that's just my conjecture.\n\nQuestions:\n- As previously mentioned, are my concerns regarding battery life and heat warranted?\n- If my concerns regarding battery life and heat are warranted, is that a problem with the model, or a problem with my machine only?  So should I try to get it exchanged for a different machine?\n\nThank you for reading!"}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "Features that wow:\nPrice vs value equation due to discrete Nvidia GTX 960 graphics processor\n256 G SSD hard drive with ease of adding another\nBacklit full size keyboard with number pad\nUnderstated styling (low bling)\nBright IPS screen (although)\nRelatively solid build\nLow fan noise even under load\nRelatively low weight at 5 lbs\n\nFeatures that are less impressive:\nLight leakage around bottom of screen\nPlastic everywhere\nKeyboard flex depending on location\nIntegrated offset and one piece touchpad/mouse\nSound is average\n\nDell is not known for making its own Dell branded computers gaming powerhousesfor that you have to jump up in price and bling to Alienware.  With Dells dedicated gaming brand you get lots of bells and whistles, including molded style cases, very solid builds, full lighting controls, generally nice specs and higher prices.  Now, try finding this current Inspiron 7550 build on Dells site. Dell seems to have made a slew of them to drop into third party vendors like Amazon while not providing the same on their own site. Certainly, Amazon customers benefit from this offering.  Styling wise the Inspiron is not Alienware, but with some nice red accents on the rear facing under screen grill and a red Dell logo on the lid, the Inspiron distinguishes itself as not your fathers Dell.  [Full disclosure, having owned and upgraded from the prior Alienware M11X R3 laptop to this 7559, I do love Alienware laptops.]\n\nMaybe things are changing with the release of Intels Skylake chips?  Skylake means the same computing power as the prior Haswell generation with reduced power consumption, along with lower heat loads.  This means that a gaming laptop can be built without it being a vacuum cleaner or jet engine for heat control at load.  The current Skylake i5 chip is highly acceptable and powerful enough to run just about anything you can toss.\n\nThe 256 G SSD comes loaded with Windows 10 and it is suggested to jump immediately to updates at Microsoft and Dell for the latest drivers.  [Having done that from the get-go I did not have any driver issues that others have expressed over wi-fi connections].  Upon initial startup and confirmation of same, and after updates, I installed a second 256 G SSD (Samsung 850 EVO).  Dell makes it easy.  One screw, and a couple of snaps later to remove a single plastic back cover piece, reveals a compartment with a connection cord ready to hook up. Restart did not immediately reveal the new drive, but Windows 10 itself has a setup utility that is in settings and hardwareand no issues after that!  Startup is quick, at less than 30 seconds under normal circumstances.\n\nAdditionally, for the 7559, the GTX 960M is a perfect lower cost, lower heat alternative and partner to Skylake than higher end 970 and 980 graphics.  Gamers should and would question if the 960M will play the games they want to playas the 960M certainly has limits depending on the game.  For the games I play the most, I can report full functionality with high settings and Physix running full out for all the Borderlands series games and Fallout 4 on the Dell Inspiron.  While I cannot report on actual FPS, there is no obvious slowdowns in full action movement for either game.  Strangely GEforce Experience does not optimize Fallout 4 at High settings, but rather medium with multiple features turned off.  Be assured you can jump to High and turn the video bling up on effects and physix.  The other advantages of the 960 is lower cost, and also surprisingly low heat output at load.  This Dell runs quiet with no audible fan noise at normal loads and tasks.  When pushed during gaming the fan is audible but is very quiet so you would not necessarily need headphones during game play.\n\nThe keyboard itself has some noticeable flex, but still comes across as solid and very friendly to gaming and touch typing with full size keys and a nice number pad.  Once you have a back lit keyboard it is hard to go back, especially if you use your laptop in less than optimal lighting conditions.  The Inspiron has simple white lighting with brightness adjustments.\n\nThe 15.6-Inch FHD IPS screen has wide viewing angles, is very bright, and good color representation.  On the downside, under darker conditions and depending on what is being displayed you can see some light leakage on the very bottom border of the screen.\n\nMouse pads are a sore point with many.  The use of single surface pads is happening more and more, and often a source of issues.  Having a work based ThinkPad, with a mostly unusable integrated pad, I always jump to a dedicated mouse.  The Dell Inspirons pad is a bit better with mostly positive and separated sections for right/left buttonsalthough the offset may not appeal to all.  Of course, if you are buying this laptop for gaming, you are already going to use a dedicated mouse.\n\nSound quality is acceptable with good stereo separation, although the subwoofer is certainly not earthshaking.\n\nSo, should you buy this laptop?  Personally, for the games I play and the tasks I do, this is a great laptop for the price, albeit not perfect .  You should consider what games you may play and read additional reviews regarding the suitability of the Nvidia 960 for your own uses prior to jumping to any system that has similar specs. Ease of memory upgrade is certainly a huge positive.  The IPS screeen while bright and mostly pleasing does have some leakage.  Perfect? No.  Praise worthy for value? YES!"}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "First confession - I am not a gamer, but I jumped at the opportunity to test and review this laptop for production purposes.  Be aware that my thoughts will be slanted in that direction.  My use is creating documents, spreadsheets, mailings, articles, and the usual web activity and blogging.  The laptop feels solid, but light.  There is a numeric keypad, a plus for spreadsheets.  The screen is great, the sound better than most, but not great.  I had no issues during set up.  Wifi was easy to connect.  There is no optical drive.  I attached a portable drive to download some software from cd with no problem.  This is NOT a touchscreen.  At first, I was shocked at the lack of touchscreen at this cost, but then again, this pc is targeted to gamers.  Multi tasking is great.  Multiple browsers, each with several programs open caused no problems.  Start up is almost immediate.  Video plays smoothly.  For people like me, who use this for work, as opposed to play, it fills the bill.  I find myself using the desktop format more than the Windows 10 \"tiles\" because of the lack of touchscreen, but that just comes down to a personal preference. All in all, this is a solid pc for my use, but the cost more than likely isn't justified for my purposes.  In the four weeks I've used it, I have had no issues or problems. The pc doesn't appear to overheat, and I like the feel of it."}

I really wanted Asus, but the closest comparable Asus laptop is: http://www.amazon.com/K501UX-Discrete-Gaming-Laptop-Windows/dp/B0146DD02G?tag=tbpre-20.  It has a slightly \"better\" processor (dual core skylake i7 6500) and a noticeable inferior 950m (with only 2 gb of graphics ram).  For the price and performance, nothing else comes close to this Dell Inspiron i7559, as of 12/15/2015.\n\nI can't believe how fast this thing is. I'm also very impressed with the 960m graphics card.

Yes it behaves differently from a Macbook, or HP laptop. Different brands are... different.\n--The matte screen is perfect.  If you like glossy screens, then you may hate it.  Personally, I don't like reflective, glossy screens -- they make sunlight and bright lights your greatest enemy.\n--Windows 10 has wonky scaling issues.  Win10 defaults are set to 125% scale in settings, which makes some text look really, really bad (particularly my browser).  I set the scale down to 100%, and it's much better. (Users must be smarter than Windows)\n--If you have problems with the graphics switching, or poor performance, remember to go into \"Power Options\" and switch the laptop to \"High Performance\" mode.

Based on the Amazon reviews and the numerous positive reviews on techie websites, I went with this one. It definitely provides the most bang for your buck. I couldn't find anything with similar specs under $1,000. This PC is super fast and the display is outstanding. I love the design, the feel, and most importantly the performance!\n\nMinor gripes would be that you will definitely see fingerprints everywhere. My other more minor gripe is the trackpad could be smoother. The material is a little textured, so the finger movement isn't the smoothest.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "Review 12/11/15: Ordered this laptop over Thanksgiving. First thing you notice is the nice aesthetics on the exterior which carries over inside. Feels slightly rugged, like a rubber texture, though plastic. Other people were complaining about the give of the plastic, but I haven't encountered much, if any, issues with my laptop. Maybe I'm more conscious of how I use the laptop and not try to beat the crap out of it, but so far all I've ever done with it has been putting it into my backpack, and using it at coffee shops, the office, and at home.\n\nWeight: it is heft, but this is not as an ultra-portable device like a MacBook Air, or HP Spectre, or even the Dell XPS 13. You can definitely feel the heft, but it's not super heavy like a desktop replacement laptop would be. Honestly, if you're looking for something lightweight that you can carry everywhere, you should be looking for an ultraportable laptop, not this. They're smaller so they're easier to carry around, and they are more efficient with their battery use. Speaking of which...\n\nBattery: This is a good laptop for a 15.6\" model with a longer battery life than expected thanks to its massive 74 WHr, 6 cell battery. Most other batteries that I've seen (Lenovo) come with 4-cell battery. Here's what I was able to figure out after some testing: if I was playing computer games at medium settings, such as Planetside 2, Starpoint Gemini 2, CS:GO, even CoD: World at War, I'm getting around 3 hours of battery life, give or take a half hour depending on how you set the screen brightness and any programs running in the background. Not bad! When it came to simple document work and website searching, I'm getting closer to the estimated 10 hour battery life. When watching youtube videos, and streaming, battery life again varies to at least 5 hours, in some cases, longer than that. This has been a huge improvement from my old Lenovo Y40 that I got about 5 years ago where battery life would at best last 1.5 hours with just youtube videos and MS Word/Excel. The only issue is the battery dongle; it is DEFINITELY LARGE. The one saving grace is that it comes with a nice rubber strap so you can neatly pack the cordage into a smaller space than let it overwhelm your backpack like an octopus. I will say that the power plug is on the LEFT side of the laptop, if that concerns anyone. ,\n\nLCD: Nothing spectacular, but definitely fine for most people. You can mess with the graphic settings to adjust your brightness and zoom (which I did to increase battery life and size of screen available to read) so it varies by a person's preference. I think the screen is fine for most likely over 90% of all laptop users. Gaming on this laptop hasn't been an issue; colors look fine and pop. Dark game moments aren't an issue, again, depending on how you like things to appear.\n\nSound: Sound is never a laptop's strong point. However, these had a little more robustness to it than I expected. I'll be using headphones or headset to game with this laptop, but for fun, I decided to play Planetside 2 on this laptop and I definitely didn't have an issue with my situational awareness in the game. Definitely was able to separate sound location of enemies coming from behind me or to my left and right. They're not going to be so amazing compared to a 5.1, or even 7.1, surround sound system, but for a gamer on the go, these work very well.\n\nBuilt-In Webcam and Mic work perfectly fine. Did a few test Skype calls and my friends were able to see me perfectly well. Not quite up to the level as my Logitech 920 webcam, but better than the 501 I was using before. Mic worked fine as well; no major issues or delay according to the test calls I did.\n\nSSD: 256GB is small for a gaming laptop. Every gamer knows that and if you buy this laptop and take a point away for that fact, then you don't know how to read product specs. If you buy something knowing it's small, then the issue is on you, not the laptop. The speed of the SSD is fine to me. Takes under 10 secs to boot up Windows, typically around 6-7 seconds to get this laptop booted. Compared to my desktop that has a 128GB SSD from years ago, it beats it by a good 10 seconds or more. There is a spare SATA bay for another Hard Drive or SATA SSD. Between a 1TB HDD or a 500GB SSD, I went with the 500GB (Samsung 850 EVO 500GB 2.5-Inch SATA III Internal SSD (MZ-75E500B/AM))  as I figured the battery would last longer with an SSD vs the HDD. Plus, I didn't need a full TB of extra space. I installed the following games: Minecraft, Entropia Universe, Starpoint Gemini 2, Planetside 2, CS:GO, Witcher 3, Trackmania Stadium, ARK Survival, Tomb Raider, CoD: WaW, CoD: MW3, Deus Ex Human Revolution, Mount & Blade Warband, Age of Empires 3. That's about 155GB of space used for 14 games. Granted, some of them are older and smaller, but I got some games that take up a lot of space and they are the games I play consistently. I still have 150GB on the main hard drive, and that's after putting in 10GB worth of pictures and videos I took over a weekend; another 310GB left on the data SSD. If I need more space, I'll most likely get a 1 or 2TB external HDD for about $100 and move files onto that. Note: The bay itself had no screws to secure the drive to, but I simply slid the SSD in and it was a perfect fit, didn't hear any rattling or shaking when I put the cover/laptop back on.\n\nRAM: Comes with 8GB DDR3L of RAM. Essentially it's just like DDR3 RAM like a desktop, just made for laptops (smaller factor). There's a single screw that holds the bottom of the laptop and covers it. Very secure; took a moment to unscrew it and get access to the components. Besides the SATA bay that's available, you can see the lone RAM card in place. Looking back now, I can't believe how easy it was to install more RAM. I thought I had to release the clips, but no, you simply align the RAM in with the socket and slide it into the slot. The clips on the slide will lock into place once you insert the RAM fully. No pulling them apart or unhooking them, unless you're taking out the RAM. But to put a new stick of RAM in, just slide it in. I bought Kingston Technology 8GB 1600MHz DDR3L (PC3-12800) 1.35V Non-ECC CL11 SODIMM Intel Laptop Memory KVR16LS11/8 just to double the RAM for an easy $37.\n\nUSB ports: (Correction) 3 USB 3.0 ports (previously I said only one, where I honestly meant at least one. Sorry for the confusion). It would have been nice if it included the new USB-C port, but that's me being greedy. SD card available on the slide; no cover for it however. Not sure if that will be an issue or not in the future, but so long as you're not shoving this laptop into dirt or sand, or purposefully trying to put dust into it, shouldn't be an issue.. Looks like a full-size HDMI port to me, but I'm not 100% sure on that. I'm sure other reviewers have stated what it is.\n\nKeyboard: Keyboard is chiclet style. Takes a little getting used to for me, but that's mainly because I prefer full size keyboards. But I do like how this has a 10 key numpad and it has a double-wide 0 button, whereas some laptops will make the 0 the size of any other number, with the other half being occupied by the right arrow key. The arrow keys themselves are smaller, which can take some getting used to, but isn't a major issue and I was able to see what they were going to be on the laptop's photos. I also appreciated that they put the CTRL key on the far bottom, left corner and not the FN key (I'm looking at you Lenovo!) The function keys are shared with the F-buttons, such as volume control, backlit keyboard, and wifi.\n\nTrackpad: It sucks. No getting around that. I went to Best Buy and tried out several different laptops, HP spectres, ASUS ROG, Apple MacbOok, Lenovo Yogas. All of them had better trackpads than this. Even Dell's other models had better, superior trackpads than this annoying piece of crap. I would gladly trade this trackpad in for Lenovo's Thinkpad trackpoint button (the little red dot in the middle of their keyboard). In some ways, I wonder if this laptop would have been better served with using the Thinkpad trackpoint button and switching out the trackpad for a slim DVD drive instead. Still, it's usable and at least works. Definitely get a wireless mouse with this. I got an old $20 wireless Logitech mouse from years ago that worked fine instead of the trackpad. However, I did just buy a new Logitech Wireless M510 gaming mouse and I would definitely recommend that (or your own preferred wire/wireless mouse) for use. Also make sure you disable the trackpad when using the mouse so you don't have mis-clicks when typing and end up using the trackpad (like I did when typing this review!)\n\nOther: Surprisingly, Dell didn't put a lot of bloatware on this laptop. The only thing that I noticed as \"bloatware\" was some utility programs and McAfee pre-installed. You definitely will want to go through your device manager and updated EVERYTHING on this laptop. I would say a good 70% of the stuff that's on here are up-to-date and fine, but there were a few things that were not quite there and could cause issues (#1 Wifi card). With me installing games, installing the RAM and SSD, and updating all the stuff on this, and using only the trackpad, it took me about 3 hours to get everything done. Most likely you will be able to get everything updated in under 90 minutes, and that includes running Windows Update, but I was being very thorough with extra attention paid to provide a PC gamer's perspective on the hardware.\n\nCost: There was another Dell laptop available for about $750-$780. Notable difference was that it include an i7 Skylake CPU (whereas this is a i5 Skylake), a SSHDD drive (1TB vs this laptop's 256 SSD), and 2GB Geforce 960M whereas this is a 4GB 960M. However, the price on that has changed to now being over $1000 so that laptop is not quite the awesome buy it once was. Difference in 4GB vs 2GB on the 960M isn't a huge deal. Slightly better, but not significant enough to make you choose one laptop over another that's similar except in price and GPU. As I mentioned earlier, I bought an SSD and another stick of RAM for another $175 at the time. So this laptop cost me $935 in total, a nice buy still. If you don't need a large SSD and go with a HDD, you could cut the price down to about $880 or less, depending on whether you go with a 1TB or smaller HDD.\n\nWill Update this review if anything else comes to mind or something else occurs.\n\n12/12/15: Someone was asking how well this laptop performs on Witcher 3. I got graphic settings all over the place, but majority is around medium. I'm getting between 30-45 fps depending on the environment and cutscenes. Game looks beautiful, and I'm not noticing any chugging or lag effects while I was running some of the early missions. So far, so good.\n\n12/22/15: Update on the review. The touchpad is VERY, VERY atrocious. I actually had it working fine where it would be enabled until I have a USB mouse attached, where it would then disable. Well, my mouse is attached and the touchpad is still working. Annoyed beyond compare, I clicked to disable the touchpad fully. Guess what? The touchpad still works!! Dell really needs to get its act together as that's some horrible drivers they got. I'm currently looking for a fix, without a lot of success. Dell really has dropped the ball on this to the point that this laptop royally sucks with the touchpad behaving as erratic as it is. It's such a simple, small issue but it's surprising how often an erratic touchpad can ruin the laptop user's experience. Reducing the review from 5 stars down to 4, and am not afraid of reducing it more if I have to if more issues pop up. I'll post a fix (if I find one)\n\n1/4/16: Okay, I found a fix for the laptop's mouse issues. It's the mouse for the most part, though the laptop can behave strangely for not deactivating properly (rebooting will correct it, SOMETIMES). If you're using a Logitech M510 wireless mouse like I am, the optical sensor will lose contact at random. The way I got it working is to remove the batteries, leave it in the ON position, and then hold down the right-mouse button, and then click the left-mouse button five times (or more). Put the batteries back in, and then the sensor should work again. If that doesn't work, try flipping the switch off, or even doing the reverse with the mouse buttons. It will eventually reset itself; the universal adapter works fine; it's just the mouse."}

System arrived this morning, had my developer's setup installed and running without a hitch in a few hours, fastest laptop setup ever. Very little bloatware, almost no tweaking. I've been buying and using laptops since they were invented, and this one quite nice. Great screen, usable keyboard, fast enough Visual Studio and my Python work. Runs Guild Wars 2 fast with graphics all the way up. Good work, Dell.\n\n** UPDATE **\nI added 8GB RAM and a 512GB high-end SSD. System is still operating excellently. Good performance, plays games well, great for development purposes. Runs cool even when gaming. Have a 2560x1440 monitor running off the HDMI port for extra screen space. Both wired and wireless networking running fine, no problems.\n\n** Another update **\nBeen doing extensive work on this machine, still happy. Only bugaboo is an odd \"double keypress\" that happens only in certain applications like Chrome, very rarely.\n\nOne nice feature: an idiot cat yanked a key top off, scared the crap outa me, but it snapped right back on fine.\n\nDoing a lot of Visual Studio 2015 and Word 2016.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "I was concerned with the amount of people experiencing driver problems. Right when I opened it up I made sure to go to device manager and update everything. There were a few drivers that needed updating, graphics controllers/cards etc. The BIOS was already up to date which surprised me. I noticed the wifi was connected but seemed to always say \"identifying\" until I did a windows update and now it just says connected and hasn't dropped at all.\n\nSkyrim runs great on high quality. I also played Path of Exile for an hour it crashed at first but haven't had any issues since. The battery seems to tell me it will only last 3 hours on balanced. When I set it to battery saver mode it says I have 7 hours left. Overall I'm very happy with this laptop, it opens and runs programs extremely fast, and is a massive upgrade from my old hp laptop. I don't have a need to upgrade the RAM but it looks pretty easy to install more, there's only one screw on the bottom.\n\nI did extensive research over Black Friday and found this one to have the best components for the price. I actually got it for $665 from amazon's warehouse deals. It is my opinion that this is probably your best bet on a budget gaming laptop."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "For starters, I am a college student so I use my laptop almost daily. I'm also a casual gamer so during my hunt for a new laptop I had some key features in mind that I knew I needed in a machine. I don't normally shop around for \"gaming\" laptops since often times companies will glorify the whole gaming aspect and charge more for s***ty parts..etc. I did however, know what specs I was looking for and I was surprised to find this deal because it fit right into my budget.\n\nI've had this laptop for almost 2 weeks and I'm pretty happy with the performance among other things. These pros/cons are based on my preferences, as other people's opinions are, so some things may not appeal to others like they did to me. Hope this review helps though!\n\nPros:\nChiclet keyboard - this keyboard is incredibly comfortable to use. Also a bonus for back lit keys. I like that despite being a 15.6 inch, it comes with the number pad as well.\n\nFans/Heating - So far I haven't had any issues with the laptop heating up and I've been running fallout 4 on 60fps. I'm impressed at how cool it stays during gameplay.\n\nSSD - 256gb of ssd was something I felt like I could benefit from having as I had been looking to replace my old laptop's hd with an ssd. Powers to the loading screen in less than 15 seconds. (not to mention there is an extra slot to put in an internal HD, which I did right away)\n\nStyle - While not as important as key specs, aesthetics can be enjoyable. Sleek red & minimalist design has everyone commenting on how cool it looks.\n\nGeforce GTX 960 - with my previous laptop I was barely able to run any games without various crashes and that was running on an AMD Radeon. Considering my previous laptop was almost 6 years old, it was definitely time for an upgrade. I had been eyeing the gtx 960 for some time and knew it was a staple feature I was looking for.\n\nIntel core i5 - My previous laptop had an i7 quad core but I was happy to have an i5 quad core in this considering the combination of other specs.\n\n***Overall, I'd consider this laptop a pretty damn good deal for someone who wants a sleek machine that runs well - from your every day user to a gamer, this laptop is a silent beast!"}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "Disappointed. While the laptop arrived quickly and worked great for a few days, the two USBs on the left side of the machine died for no apparent reason. One minute they were fine, with an iPhone 6 connected and charging away. The next, they were dead.\n\nI called Dell support and their tech told me to send it back to them for repair. I did. They had it one day and sent it back. I opened up the box, set the machine on my kitchen table, fired it up, and....\n\nThe USBs still don't work. It was returned to me in exactly the same broken condition as when I boxed it up, except for the included Resolution Center System Repaired letter that states, \"Your system has been thoroughly tested and run through full system diagnostics by a certified technician based on the reported symptoms.\" Clearly they did not. They repaired exactly nothing. Seems like they took it out the box I sent it to them in, added the letter, stuck it into another box and sent it back. How in the world Dell can claim, IN WRITING no less, that \"Prior to shipment your system was tested for full functionality\" I cannot understand.\n\nEdit: Just to be clear -- Yes, I tried all the ports with a known-to-work USB device. The broken ports were still broken, and the functioning port on the right of the keyboard still worked just fine.\n\nAnd now, it's back into the box and back for \"repairs.\" Again. Really disappointed. This is my first Dell product, and it is very likely my last."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "UPDATE:  After using the computer for a while now I recently had the misfortune of having my graphics card die.  It's 5 months past the 1 year warranty so they will no longer do anything about the hardware issue.  I can't help but feel ripped off because of it's short lifespan.  I called dell and after 30 minutes of trying I was told I cannot buy a replacement graphics card as they don't sell them.  So essentially I have an $800 paperweight now. GG\n\nBelow is my original review.\n\nBought this as a laptop for travel and light gaming and it certainly performs well.  I can get over 120fps with csgo steadily enough and over 100 in smoke.  While gaming this laptop is great.  However while doing simple things like writing this review, I've had over 5 freezes already.  It appears that the graphics switch from nvidia to intel HD graphics when not gaming.  The intel graphics are about as good as a turd on as tick at rendering even the simplest things.  Want to look something up on google maps?  Best do it on a different computer.  Want to write an essay? this is not your pick.  Want to game?  This one works well.  I'm sure there's a setting that I'll find and be able to change it.  I've already tried making nvidia my primary 3d rendering but it didn't work.  I can probably figure it out but if you're a normal parent with kids I wouldn't recommend or you will be taking it to the shop.\n\nAlso, there is no touch screen on this laptop, regardless of what the little movie clip they show may imply so don't be fooled by false advertising."}

The first day I spent a few hours updating drivers, which can be found on the Dell website, as well as using the Intel update app. Call DELL customer support because they know what to update. Make sure you have your express service number ready (It can be found on the bottom of your laptop).\n\nI test ran Metro 2033, Diablo III, Skyrim, and Far Cry 3, and they all run great! They get good fps, diablo III can run on max graphics with no real frame dropping.\nI was debating whether or not to buy this laptop or the Lenovo Y700, but I decided on this one, because the NVIDIA 960M will become outdated soon, and I would rather drop $800 on this than $1100 on the Lenovo.\n\nThe build quality is alright. I am a fan of the keys, though they are a bit shallow. The touchpad is not that good, the material feels a bit rough, and it doesn't register too well. But after a while I actually got used to it and it's ok. The touchpad is obsolete if you use a mouse though.\n\nThe laptop isn't too heavy, at around 5-6 pounds, and works well for school. I've already written a lab report and a few homeworks on it.\n\nThe main issue I have is that the driver randomly crashes every now and then. In a week it has crashed about 4 times, but it reboots quickly and its no issue. However I feel like this could become an issue in the future.\n\nOverall I think it is a great laptop, and I would give it 5 stars if it weren't for the crashes."}

So I had to find the usb 3.0 extensible host controller for windows 7.\n\nThe laptop's performance is pretty good. I played Titanfall at 1080p on medium settings and got decent framerates.\n\nHowever, the touchpad is pretty horribly vomit. The detection is sometimes erratic and for some reason the touchpad's detection area extends to over the left and right clickers.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "Laptop itself was pretty great. There are a few minor things that caught my eye though, and it may or may not bother you.\n\n1) the laptop's keypad's 0 butten has the number 0 written on the bottom left corner, instead of in the center like the other numbers (will attach a picture when I get home). Nothing wrong functionally, it just irritates me I guess.\n2) the keyboard isn't as good as it could be. It just feels really flat and dull when I type anything. Also, when I press the space bar (I use space bar to scroll down a website, instead of using a mouse), about once in three times, it will register as double space bars, sending me way down the webpage.\n3) Touchpad as well is really not the best it could have been.\n4) The laptop doesn't seem to be built very well, the right part of my laptop, upper right of the power button, has had the part kind of become loose, after one week of use.\n\nAnd I had several other problems, but these may not apply to you.\na) When I use my laptop, about once every other day, the laptop will freeze for about 2 seconds, and then work again. It will freeze every 4-6 seconds, including the 2 seconds of freezing, so the laptop becomes kind of unusable. It works again, if it's restarted again. I've tried to figure out why, but I have been unable to, perhaps because I'm not the most tech savvy, but doing a factory reset did not fix it.\n\nb) When my laptop runs out of battery and turns off (I don't connect the charger from about 11 at night, so that I go to sleep when the laptop runs out of juice, it works for me), when I restart it, the resolution is all wonky. Started up a game (binding of isaac, its not too hard to run), and it lagged very much, unplayably. Crusader Kings 2 had its resolution broken when I started it, and I couldn't even access the menu since it was lagging so much that the menu wouldn't open. I clicked on the nvidia icon on the bottom right, and then it said something along the lines of, the graphics card does not recognize the monitor. And nvidia control panel wouldn't start. A couple of days later, I found out the solution, and that was to go to the device manager, and disable then enable the intel graphics, not the nvidia, then the graphics card starts running again. Weird.\n\nAnyways, because of these issues, I'm going to return this laptop for a replacement, since I actually quite like the laptop a bit, especially for the price. I hope the next one won't have such issues."}

I knew with the battery size and two fans I wasn't getting an ultra book, but it's still thinner than both of my old ones (14in and 15in). I've had no driver issues either or wifi troubles like some. I turned it on, did all the setup stuff, ran windows update, let those install, added a second was, and was good to go. Even bought a newly released game off of steam to see how the graphics were. I could run a 2015 October released game just slightly below ultra settings. Just a few small tweaks and I could run it with zero problems. Looked way, way better than ib expected after reading reviews. Speakers and screen are great also.

My wife has an alienware 15 from 2012 and this feels and looks very similar in terms of build quality.\n\nI bought this under the guise of doing onsite renders but the first program I installed was steam and games look great and smooth on it.\n\nIt's very easy to open (one screw and some plastic tabs) and there is a connection taped in the bay right there for the 2.5 along with the open ram slot.\n\nThis does shows finger prints quite easily and the trackpad has taken a bit of learning to get used to so I give this a 4.8/5."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "I recently had an opportunity to review the new Dell gaming laptop, the  Dell Inspiron i7559-763BLK 15.6\" Full-HD Gaming Laptop. I will attempt to write a review that rightfully praises the machine without too much jargon, acronyms or computer-ese (all which I barely speak but cannot seem to talk about with computers without).  I should point out that I am not an expert userif I am an expert anything, Im an expert consumer.  I do my research and spread what I find for anyone else, just trying to make the decision path easier.\n\nFirst of all, this is not just a laptop, its a pretty laptop.  Ordinarily, I couldn't care less about that it looks like (looks like a laptop!) but this one is trimmed out in red and looks great.  About time someone tried to make a nicer looking laptop.  I will add pictures so you can see shortly.\n\nBut looks aside, the computer itself is very solid.  When you order a gaming machine, that usually means beefed up graphics and memory capability, something that can quickly process complexity, parse interfaces, etc.  The machine is a quad-core which means that although it is a single computing component, it has four units independently reading and executing processes. Multicore processes were developed for embedded, network, digital signal processes and graphics, pretty much everything you would expect from a gaming machine. In theory (its a good theory), that means it will be lighting fast as you have four units thinking about whatever challenges you are throwing at them.  In reality, parallel related issues may limit the speed gains, but not so as you would notice on this computer.\n\nThis one is fast, really fast.  Although designed for game graphics, I have more mundane uses in mind: internet, occasional games, Microsoft Office documents and some other applications.  What I want is reasonably fast, reproducible processing and a nice long runway before I have to start thinking about upgrading to a new computer (3-5 years would be nice!) I do play video games, but this one is mostly for home office work and I believe it is an excellent computer and a great value for its cost.  For those with upgrades in mind, the computer has an internal slot for an extra disk drive if you want to install it. RAM can also be upgraded.\n\nSo, the computer comes on, boots up fast.  You have to run the normal Windows 10 set up but I had the unit up and running in about 10 minutes. Boot up time was about 25 seconds (saw another reviewer mention 17 seconds, I couldn't get to desktop quite that fast, but 25 seconds is certainly fast enough).  I confirmed the drivers and BIOs and Windows were all properly up to date and had no issues connecting to internet.  While not thrilled with Microsoft Edge as default browser, thats not the computers fault; its a Microsoft issue.  I switched over to IE and ran into the usual recent incompatibility/freezes/crash issues, but Ive seen that on a lot of computers now.  Also not the computers fault.  In fact, this laptop handled most of those issues better than any other computer Ive seen, but that may be a function of being new.\n\nThe computer is QUIET.  There are times when Im opening the top that I need to see if its actually on; its that quiet.  The screen is sharp and lovely and the keys are backlit, which is a lot cooler and more useful that I might have guessed. Ive never had the backlit keyboard before, now Im not sure how Id live without it.\n\nSo, a few cons, nothing that really removes stars:\n- The exterior casing of the computer seems prone to show every time a finger touches it.  You can wipe the oils from your hands off it, but they will come back.  Not sure what a good solution is, but Id taken to giving it a quick wipe whenever Im done using the computer.\n- The mouse pad, by which I mean the finger-field by which you manipulate the virtual mouse takes up a fair amount of room.  I don't know many game players that use one of those pads to play games (Im sure there are some who will swear by them and curse at me for suggesting otherwise) but I use a mouse attached through the USB.  Which means theres a lot of wasted space between edge of casing and actual keyboard.\n- At 8 GB of memory, it seems a little light, but you can upgrade to your own specs, easy to do, the slot opens right up.\n\nAll in all, a great computer at a very good price, very strong recommend!"}

Rating Changed from 4 stars, to 5 stars. Thanks Dell!\n\nUPDATE (1/22/2016): I have been in contact with Dell support and they say a lot of other customers are experiencing the Intel HD Graphics driver crashing and recovering on certain actions. Yes I have updated the drivers to the latest one, here is a video of it: [...]\n\nVery nice looking laptop, great specs as well. I added an 8GB Kingston Ram stick (16GB total). I might add a second SSD down the road, but no need for one right now.\n\nInitial thoughts:\nCONS:\n1. WOW this thing is HEAVY! I was not expecting it to be as heavy as my 6 year old HP laptop with an optical drive AND a huge aftermarket battery (anker) that sticks out from the back.\n2. I hated the trackpad, first couple of hours I could not use it. My finger kept getting stuck because it's textured a bit.\n3. Huge screen bleed at the bottom center (2 spots) one on the slight right is very bad during boot up.\n\nI did all the driver updates, bios update, and windows update right away, so I am not experiencing any issues other reviewers are reporting. But time will tell, I've only used it for about 4-5 hours.\n\nBesides the 3 issues above, the laptop is a great buy."}

However, I would not recommend it to any friend, since it can be too risky.\n\nGood:\n1) for the price (got it for $759 from amazon) it has great specifications - new processor, good graphics card and SSD\n2) screen is good, IPS\n3) easy to expand - I bought 8 GB memory - http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CQ35HBQ  (same type as was preinstalled, you can get faster one, but probably not worth it , since will need to upgrade both slots).\nand 2 TB hard drive - http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00I8O6OQ4  (since already had SSD, was no real need to get hybrid)\nMemory is standard, 8GB was taking one slot, so easy to upgrade it.\nHard disk installation was very easy too - caddy and just one cable to connect already were waiting.\nAnd it is was easy to access. So, for about $900 dollars all together (including tax), I got upgraded laptop with 16 gb memory and 256+2TB drives.\n4) not too much bloatware (most of bloatware actually is included in Windows 10 already - but, you are getting almost all new computers with this system anyway).\n\nSo for me this laptop is good.\n\nHowever, there are some bad things which will prevent me from recommending it to other people\n1) not so big deal, but only 3 USB ports, only HDMI for video out, Was expecting better at this price.\n2) and too much space wasted around screen.\n3) very BETA with drivers - had problems with\n - graphics display driver (INTEL)  - periodically, it is giving me message that driver crashed but was restored.\n - power adapter driver - some strange messages that power adapter not recognized\n - WiFi adapter - just stopping working and not seeing any network\n  - touchpad driver - was unable to turn it off (used standard mouse option to turn it off when external mouse is connected, then just turned it off completely - but it still worked.\n\nProblems are partially solved (becoming not so often) by installing new drivers. Also, computer restarts helping... (unfortunately battery is non-removable, so hard restart is more complicated). I feel myself confident enough to be able to deal with all this stuff myself (but, I did some computer programming for about 20 years). However, can easily see people getting stuck with this computer, so would not recommend it to other.\n\nActually I was surprised that respected company as Dell would not make sure that laptop working from start without these problems."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "I've had this laptop for roughly three weeks now and so far so good. Its clearly one of the best laptops currently out there in this price range especially if your looking for one with a dedicated graphics card. In case you guys didn't know, this is Dell's attempt at countering Lenovo's Y series and they managed to do one fine job without the excessive gamer look.\n\nAs others have mentioned beforehand, the hardware in this thing is fantastic, but the software drivers included are outdated. Right after creating your user account for this laptop, you should immediately go to the dell's support webpage and download/install all the new drivers, esp the network ones. Hopefully your wifi holds up during this time, if it does, you should be problem free after doing a windows update. I would recommend downloading driver booster 3 to further update the drivers since not everything is up to date on dell's webpage.\n\nFor someone whose upgrading from an old 5 year old laptop, this machine is a beast. It boots up within like 3 seconds and can play most current games at least on medium settings. But for others that are constantly upgrading and comparing, people have mentioned that the screen is inferior to others in this price range with some back-light bleeding. The keyboard will take some time to get used to, and the touch pad is considered to be horrible by most users, but I use a mouse so it doesn't affect me.\n\nOne of the best design aspect of this laptop is that you can access the back by unscrewing a single screw. This allows one to easily add a secondary HD or another stick of ram."}

No sound from the speakers and no output through the headphone jack. Uninstalled and reinstalled the drives many times but it was no use. Dell support was very nice and responsive, but ultimately could not fix the problem and suggested I do a return. I did.\n\nThe second laptop arrived and it all seemed well, until the keyboard froze up and started going absolutely bananas. It did this a couple of times in two hours of use, then returned to normal. I thought it was a firmware bug so I got the latest drivers from Dell's website. It all seemed well. I left a Word document open and went to take the dog for a walk. When I came back about 20 minutes later, the document was chock full of random characters going all the way down. I rebooted, opened an notepad and started typing away. It started freaking out. Again. See my video.\n\nOnce again, a return was suggested and at this point, I will not be getting a third one. The quality control isn't filling me with confidence. If the third laptop manages to work, I don't expect it will stay functional for very long and do not want to risk being left out in the cold without a warranty.\n\nIt's a shame because it is a beautiful device that performs admirably for the price point. It managed to score ~3950 in 3DMark Firestrike which is actually really good. Boot times are amazingly fast (I would know, I had to reboot both devices at least 50 times between all the troubleshooting). I briefly loaded Skyrim and it was running pretty solid at 1080p with the HD textures pack installed. Color me impressed.\n\nFor those who are looking to buying this laptop, I say do so at your own peril. It is a fantastic deal, performs amazingly well and looks stunning but from my perspective seems to have serious quality control problems."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "Excellent laptop for the money.\n\nPros:\nI followed the advice of everyone here and got an additional SSD and 8GB ramstick. *DO THAT* It literally took me four minutes to install both and pop the back back on. The cable is there ready to plug in. Slight downside: I did have to open the disk manager and format the SSD in order for windows to recognize it. At first I thought I'd gotten a bad unit, but the BIOS was seeing it. A quick google got me squared up on that. So four minutes to install and about another 5 to get the laptop to recognize the drive, and I got 10 minutes into an upgrade to double the storage and ram.\nSounds system is pretty good for a laptop.\nMine does not have any light bleed that I can detect, I must have gotten lucky in that regard.\nVERY snappy. Once I got through the initial setup rigmarole I tested the startup from a hard power off: 17 seconds from the time I pressed the button to the time I was able to log in. About another half second after I punched in my credentials. Also, on restart, from power up to log in was down to about 7 seconds or so.\nA lot of people are complaining about the keyboard and trackpad, I like both of them. The offset doesn't bother me. I think this is a lot of personal opinion.\n\nCons:\nA LOT of the drivers are outdated. I didn't have the WiFi problem, but the first thing I did when I opened the box is hook it up to a LAN cable and start downloading drivers. Between deleting bloatware and updating drivers I put about 3 hours into getting it set up.\nThe bloatware isn't the worst I've seen, but it exists and it sucks to have to hunt it down and crush it.\nI have experienced the 'screen flicker' that people mention when it's on battery power. It's not bad, but randomly the screen does the slightest little flicker. Nothing disruptive, but I have seen it. A little googling and I find that it's a Dell Power Management thing gauging the brightness of the screen. It didn't bother me enough to make it stop, but it might drive some people crazy.\nProprietary charger. I know this is normal in today's day and age, but that doesn't mean I have to like it.\n\nNot a pro or a con, but I downloaded a firmware update via the device manager and it called for a restart (no big deal right? super quick restarts). I hit the \"restart\" button and I resumed work on my other computer, the next thing I know the damned thing sounds like it's about to lift off my desk and startled me a little bit. Turns out, when it's updating the firmware it maxes out the fans just in case.\n\nI've not played any games on it, but I've done some processor intensive stuff, it handles it like a champ."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "This machine is easily one of the best machines money can buy in its price range. Sure you can go and spend $1000+ on a different machine but you will get similar specs for only a few \"better\" options. Most of the $1000+ machines have a better touchpad or better ram upgrade ability, or maybe even an Nvidia 965 card but mostly they aren't really any better. This machine has everything I wanted and more. I am not a major gamer, but I mainly bought the device to replace my old gaming machine (Lenovo Y480) and I am not disappointed. Here are my thoughts:\n\nPROS:\n\n1. Screen - you get a 15.6 inch, 1080p, IPS, Matte finish display that is absolutely killer. Its colors, viewing angles, and overall quality shines. I adjusted my color saturation and contrast (cause I prefer it more saturated) from the Intel control panel and love it even more. You will not be disappointed with this screen in those respects.\n\n2. Keyboard - I cannot say enough good things about the keyboard. I love the ways the keys feel, look, and perform. They have a smaller distance to travel when pushing the keys which I really like plus I like how they are spaced out as well. The backlight is awesome (I prefer the white/blue type lighting) and it does have the timeout feature that can be customized via Windows Mobility Center. I personally turn the auto-off feature to \"never\" cause I don't like the backlights timing out but that is just me.\n\n3. CPU - For the price range, you simply cannot beat the Intel Core I5-6300HQ found in this machine. Its super quick, consumes less power than previous chips and I haven't experienced a single hiccup. No it isn't hyperthreaded, but I don't use a single application that even takes advantage of such a feature (mainly games; which don't use it) plus I have done some (light) photoshopping and it processes so fast so I guess it would really only be advantageous to those who work heavily with photoshop or CAD or video encoding (none of which I do and have no plans to ever do).\n\n4. GPU - the Nvidia GTX 960 4GB model in this machine absolutely blows my mind! I bought the game mainly to play Fallout 4 and Assassins Creed games and let me tell you, it doesn't disappoint. I run Fallout 4 on High to Ultra settings and never, I repeat, NEVER drop below 35 FPS. On just the High settings, I hit 45-50 on average. So this device is great for gaming. Don't necessarily believe everything you read about game requirements cause Fallout 4 initially put me to \"low\" settings but it will easily do much better. Keep in mind that consoles typically run games on \"medium\" settings at best and lock the framerate at 30FPS (boring). With PC gaming, you have so much control over your performance so its the way to go (for me at least).\n\n5. RAM - It comes with 8GB of DDR3L ram at 1600Mhz. Its expandable to 16gb; but no further. Personally, I cannot see within the next 5+ years or so that it will ever be remotely necessary to have more than 16gb so its fine for me. Also, it doesn't support DDR4 ram but that's okay with me cause all DDR4 really brought to the table is power efficiency. No real performance changes (not yet anyway) plus DDR4 is more expensive. I have already ordered the popular Kingston 8gb ram from Amazon and installed it. It runs like a dream.\n\n6. Ports - It has a satisfactory amount of ports. Its got 3 USB 3.0 ports (all very quick and one of them will charge when laptop is asleep) and it has an SD card slot along with HDMI. The HDMI is version 1.4 which supports up to 5 external monitors so its quite expandable. I am pleased with it.\n\n7. Body - I actually really like the soft, rubber-like plastic of the device. Its very soft to the touch but still feel premium and sturdy. The hinges on my screen are so tight that they make a slight popping sound from time to time when opening and closing the laptop (which is good, means they won't break anytime soon). Overall, I like the body.\n\n8. Customization - On laptops, there are really only a few things a user can customize, the RAM and the Hardrive(s) were the only ones I care about. This machine is by far, the easiest laptop to customize that I've ever owned. On the underside of laptop, there is one (that's right one) screw that holds the plastic cover/shield on and with a few simply snaps (the cover is snapped on but the cover is super simple to remove and replace) you can remove it to reveal the ram (all you need is one 8gb ram stick to max it out) and an empty 2.5 inch bay for a new hard drive. I scavenged a 2.5 inch, 500GB Western Digital 7200 RPM HDD from an old laptop and put it in there. Booted my machine up, formatted the new hard drive and it works like a charm. Took me maybe 15 minutes to add ram and the hard drive. Couldn't be more simple. Also, there are no screws to hold in the new hard drive but they aren't needed as it is designed to fit snug (and it does). Any 2.5 inch drive should work (I plan on adding another 250SSD before long, but don't have the cash at the moment).\n\n9. Hard Drive - who doesn't love their OS to come installed on an SSD? The SSD performs super fast and is quite solid. I had exactly 200GB of usable space when I pulled it out of the box and I am completely fine with that. I have several (and you probably do too) external drives plus the new drive I added so space isn't an issue. I know you can buy other laptops with larger drives but they are HDD's and you would have to go through the lengthy process of cloning your OS and that takes time I simply don't have. Plus, there is a margin of error so do yourself a favor and buy a laptop with the OS already installed on the SSD. Solid slate is the way to go!\n\n10. Speakers - the speakers are quite loud and sound amazing. I know some reviewers have said they are just okay or subpar but I disagree. They sound full and quite nice. Plus the subwoofer does make a difference (it isn't a huge difference, but its there). I do have a slight popping sound that happens only when the speakers haven't been active for about one minute. As soon as they play a sound, the first thing they do is pop, but it isn't loud and is actually more noticeable at lower volumes. To fix this, simply use the generic Windows sound drivers and the popping will stop. However, you will lose the richness of the speakers and you won't be able to use the Dell equalizer software it comes with (which is pretty good). Plus it doesn't get as loud with the generic driver. The popping never happens so long as the speakers stay active. So, in other words, I only hear it once while playing a game and then never again. I know some people have said it pops constantly for them, but I haven't experienced this. I updated the RealTek driver from Dell's website but it doesn't stop the popping. I don't really care as they sound amazing and the pop only happens once so I'm good with it. The red speaker grille is a nice touch too.\n\n10. Touchpad - now I know what you are thinking, why is the touchpad in the \"Pros\" section, well that is because once you get it working right, its a fantastic touch pad. I actually love the feel of the pad. I like that grainy texture and the size is nice. I know some people don't like that it isn't centered but that doesn't bother me because my work laptop is like that so I'm used to it. It has a nice click to it as well (even though I use mainly tapping as opposed to pressing). Now....Dell really needed to do a better job and preparing this touchpad before shipping this device. It has A MAJOR DRIVER conflict with Windows drivers. It is an ELAN compatible touchpad; but mine didn't come with any ELAN software installed. I had to go and find it (only to discover that I didn't like their version of the software so I downloaded a better one [download below]).\n\n[...]\n\nThat version of software is much better and provides ALL the features of the touchpad (unlike the Dell one they provide which only provides some of the features). You will have to load it in through Device manager (the installed doesn't work right) so keep that in mind. Now, to get it work properly, I had to follow these steps:\n\n1. Open Device manager\n2. Under \"Human interface devices\" find the \"I2C HID\" driver and disable it. It won't say anything about a touchpad on it; but if you don't do this, then the touchpad will take the standard Windows 10 driver and use that instead of your custom ELAN software (which is far more flexible).\n3. Reboot\n4. Open Device manager again\n5. Go to \"Mice and other pointing devices\" and you should find something called \"Dell touchpad\" or PS/2 Device\"\n6. Right-click and select \"update driver software\"\n7. Choose \"browse my computer for driver software\"\n8. Choose \"Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer\"\n9. Choose the \"have disk\" option and paste in the path from the drivers folder (see below on how to do that)\n10. It will pop up a window saying these drivers are unsigned and might cause problems, ignore it, and continue (I've done this 50 times, it works)\n11. Reboot\n12. Upon boot, in the lower right side of your task bar, open the mouse properties by right clicking and hitting the properties option.\n13. Customize away!\n\nIn order to obtain the path for step 9 above, download the driver via the link I provided, then EXTRACT the files using an extraction tool (I use Winrar but the built in Windows one will work too). Then go to the path on top the explorer and copy the path (its next to the arrow navigation). Once copied, you can paste it in for step 9.\n\nSo you might be wondering what the downsides are to disabling that \"I2C HID\" driver. Well here is what I have found. It will disable the touchscreen (which the machine doesn't have anyway so no big deal) and that auto timeout feature for the keyboard backlight will no longer work (I couldn't care less; the backlight still works, its just all manual now). That's all I've found! My game controller, keyboard, ports, screen, speakers, blah blah all work perfectly fine. The touchpad is buttery smooth with no jankiness or weird scrolling issues that others are reporting. It isn't the touchpad that is causing those issues; its the driver conflicts.\n\n11. Battery- this comes with a rather beefy 74W battery. I easily get 6-7 hours on normal usage with half brightness. I bet I could get 10 with lower brightness. I haven't tried gaming on the battery yet so I couldn't say the life but I am thinking around 3 hours or so. Its one of the reasons the laptop is kinda heavy and a bit thicker than similar laptops (along with the 2.5'' bay for a new hard driver).\n\nCONS:\n\n1. Screen - I do have the light bleed that many are reporting on the bottom of the screen. However, you can only see it on a black screen and if the brightness is cranked to 100%. I can't even see it on 90%; only at 100%. I rarely ever use 100% because its plenty bright at 60-70% so its not an issue for me.\n\n2. Ports - No VGA or Optical drive - this is purely subjective but I don't care about either personally. Not really a con for me, but might be for some.\n\n3. RAM - No DDR4 support and cannot go above 16GB (again, not a big deal).\n\n4. Body - It is a fingerprint magnet. Not a horrible issue, but still one worth mentioning.\n\n5. Speakers - they will pop once after they have been inactive for a least one minute. Otherwise, no popping or cracking. Easy fix is to change driver over to generic sound driver built into Windows.\n\n6. Touchpad - really Dell, why did I have to waste 8 hours of my life trying to figure out why the features my touchpad should have weren't working? Horrible QA process apparently on their part. Once you get it working, its great but its a shame that process wasn't listed anywhere or that you even have to go through it.\n\nSUMMARY:\n\nThis machine is an excellent buy for the money. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great laptop for really anything. It should be future proof for at least 5 years or so (graphics card will get old first, but what else is new...). Also, I never had any freezing or bootup issues (I've installed the latest BIOS too).\n\nTL/DR....buy this machine."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "I got this yesterday and spent A LOT of time on it.  It seems Dell is updating the installed drivers as my laptop had no issues described in the previous reviews.  I did install all the latest ones just to be sure.\n\nThe laptop is fantastic.  It is smaller, slimmer and lighter than the Dell Lattitude e6540 I use for work.  This is my first machine with an SSD and I really underestimated its value.  Its not just that it goes from cold start to a desktop in less then 20 seconds.  Everything you do is impacted by the SSD.  Programs install way faster, open faster, everything just works better.  I am not a hard core gamer.  I do play CS:GO, which worked great last night at ultra settings.  The keyboard is super nice.  The trackpad works fine.  I'm not sure what folks are complaining about...or maybe all my other laptop have crappy trackpads and I am used to it!  Battery life was good until I cranked up the video settings and set the lap to run on the GTX 960M all the time.  I might undo that.\n\nI do wish the screen was a bit brighter.  This is not a Dell issue.  This is a common complaint about IPS screens."}

The battery is great (5-6 hours simple stuff, 3 hours playing), if you are using it for playing and is not plugged in it does get hot but I believe that is normal due the draining of the battery.

I've played games like Tera and Blade & Soul on it without any lag or fps drops on decent settings. I can't say much for battery life because most of the time I use it plugged in but I'm sure its good. There's nothing I can say that's really bad about the laptop for the $799 I spent. I honestly can't believe it got as many bad reviews as it did. Some people may just have bad luck I guess. I'd recommend this laptop to anyone. Oh and 1 tip would be to remove the eDellRoot Certficate by either using Windows Defender to do a full scan OR google eDellRoot Certificate removal tool and you're all set. I hope everyone that buys it enjoys it as much as I do. Happy Holidays ~"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "I've had this for a few days, and I'm very impressed so far. In my job, I've used a high-end Macbook Pro for three years, and I'm very impressed with both the hardware and software, but put off by the price, proprietary everything, and Apple community snobbishness. I'm not a Windows fan, so mainly I was looking for a laptop I could turn into a Linux powerhouse with the ability to run whatever other operating systems I needed/wanted as virtual machines. My basic requirements were: 16 GB RAM, 500+ GB SSD, long battery life, multi-core CPU, excellent graphics, nice fit and finish, and finally,and good value for a total price tag under $1,000.\n\nThis laptop was able to meet all of those requirements. About $40 got me another 8 GB stick of RAM. About $140 got me an excellent 500GB SSD Since there is space/interface for another SATA drive in the system, this brings the total to 756 GB. Add an USB 3 DVD R/W drive and a couple of small accessories, and I still came in under budget (barely). The SquareTrade 3 year warranty will bump me over, but for some types of electronic gear, I think the insurance is worth it.\n\nMy first task upon receiving the laptop and getting logged in was to create Windows 10 installation media so I could install a clean copy of Windows. As a security geek, my best advice is to do this as soon as possible. Most new Windows computers are a security nightmare due to crapware and OEM-induced security issues (deliberate or accidental). In Dell's case, around the time frame of my buying this computer, it was revealed that they had created a nightmare security issue in most of their laptops and were doing the usual non-apologies/backpedaling/\"we take security seriously\" dance. Again, the best way to avoid all of this cruft is just to reinstall Windows from scratch as soon as you get the computer.\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10\n\nAfter doing a clean Windows install and getting online, visit the Dell site, enter your express service code and download/reinstall any recommended drivers. There were minor glitches with a couple of these, but upon review, they weren't critical and generally Microsoft does a good job of integrating new drivers anyway. Be sure to purchase/install good Antivirus software (you would have had to do that anyway after your sample AV subscription expired) and ideally avoid IE/Edge like the plague. Also, if you use the Chrome or Firefox browser, definitely add an add blocker extension, and consider adding script blocking as well (YMMV since script blocking can be a bit of a pain to learn and use). These things alone will put you way ahead of most users security-wise. One other free tip: Forego Microsoft Office and download/use LibreOffice. For all but the most die-hard Office fans, this excellent suite is a hallmark of open source software. Personally, I'm moving more toward the cloud with Google drive/apps (and local backups), but old habits die hard.\n\nAs I mentioned, I wanted to run Linux -- ideally Linux Mint. A couple of other reviewers did an excellent job of covering some of the tips and tricks of getting Linux running on this hardware. (For those not familiar with Linux, it is extremely powerful, but often lags a few months behind on the latest drivers since in most cases, the Linux community and kernel developers are reverse engineering these.) When I got ready to install Linux as a dual-boot, I happened to catch that the latest version of Ubuntu was needed in order for the kernel to support the wireless chipset. <sigh> OK... Ubuntu is good, too.\n\nAfter following the instructions for installing Ubuntu (resizing the Windows partition with GParted to free up 60 GB for Linux on the 256 GB SSD), I formatted the 500 GB SSD as ext4, and changed my home directory to that partition. Everything was proceeding smoothly when I noticed that the fans on the laptop were coming on occasionally and that my projected battery life was about 3-4 hours. Further testing showed that the kworker and ksoftirqd processes were maxing out one core. A little research showed that this is a known bug. https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1488426 I may play around with the kernel patch later, but for now, I installed VirtualBox in Windows and created a Linux Mint virtual machine. This works great. The only problem I need to solve is mounting the ext4 partition on the SSD. There are several possible approaches to this, so Ill just have to see what works best.\n\nThe funny thing is that in a few months, most/all of these problems will go away and Ill be fully back in Linux Nirvana. For now, these workarounds still leave me a happy camper because the hardware Im using is very well done. Hopefully I won't have to retract that statement later as a few other reviewers have -- QC seems to have been a bit of an issue so far. Here is a hardware impressions summary:\n\n1. Fit and finish are excellent. The unit is a bit heavier and thicker than Ive become spoiled by with my MBP, but nothing to quibble about, given all the other ameneties.\n2. Screen is bright and beautiful.\n3. Power brick is truly a brick, with a cord from brick to computer that looks like a car jumper cable. There is no excuse for huge, clunky power supplies in this day and age. Im looking at you, Dell! Also, Apples magnetic charging port that removes the possibility of breaking a laptop because of stress on that one little jack is an enlightened approach. Surely there is a way to invent something similar without having to pay tribute to the patent gods?\n4. Keyboard is very nice. The offset due to the numeric keypad is a little jarring as I move back-and-forth between systems, but Im getting used to it.\n5. All ports seem to work fine. Id love to have a mini display port in addition to the DVI port, mainly because the mini display ports have become so useful for other accessories that need high-speed interfaces. However, the DVI port seems to work just fine and the three USB 3 ports can still handle quite a bit of I/O.\n6. The long battery life (Im getting estimates under a clean Windows install of 12+ hours) is quite welcome. For someone mostly doing writing and web research while on battery, this is Chromebook territory! On the down side, the trend toward non-removable batteries in devices is disturbing. I'm pretty sure I'll be able to get a replacement battery and install it when the time comes, but for many folks, this is just forcing premature obsolescence.\n7. Even when the CPU/GPU were stressed somewhat, the unit remained relatively cool and the fans were not obnoxious.\n\nAs a general-purpose laptop, the biggest benefit of getting something like this, instead of a low end laptop is more years of useful service. Ive gotten almost ten years out of my last laptop because I didn't cheap out when I bought it, and my daughter is still using it at school for programming and research. (However, Linux helped my in that life extension, otherwise indows upgrades would have retired that one at around 4-5 years.)  If you're looking for a laptop in the $300-400 range, don't count on more than three years of useful service before you are seriously wanting something more. Overall, I think this is an excellent buy for someone who wants a very powerful laptop for general purposes, or even as a budget gaming rig."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "This Dell Inspiron 15\" laptop was purchased about 2 weeks ago (mid-Nov 2015) after my other laptop died (mostly- graphic card fail).  Previous laptop was a Dell 1520 with 1 hdd (7200rpm- replaced a few times), m8600gt card, 5gb ram (upgraded from 2gb) and a bunch of other details.\n\nI was looking at other brands and even some options at XoticPC.  They offer numerous versions and upgrades, which is great, but can easily double or triple your budget in a build if one isn't careful  lol .  Anyway, back to the prebuilt -\n\nThis was ready to go out of the box.  Battery was mostly full.\n\nRuns quiet with the ssd vs the 7200rpm drive I used to have and that part is cooler as well.\n\nBattery - as noted is was near full charge and ran for a number of hours before it got down to low levels.  At this time I plugged in the 130w charger (brick).  No response.  Actually an error stating that this wasn't recognized and not charging.  huh?? Everything was in order, no cracks, dents, etc...  I plugged in my older 90w from other computer, same error but it charged. ...  Well, skip some time for research, talk with dell rep and update. It's working  It seems that has happened with other units.  There is a bios update that addresses that.  I didn't flash this machine, yet.  I did have to push the end in the computer and held it there for a few seconds after I did some update and all errors went away.  I mention this in case others have a similar issue.  My concern for the future is that the connector on my previous computer got loose after a few years.  The connector on this 130w charger seems to have a thicker and stronger sheathing.  Hopefully the insides are better as well.\n\nTouchpad - meh.  This is why I took off 1 star, that and some other \"nickel-and-dime\" issues.  The problem I am having is some \"coasting\" of the cursor and pausing (or intermittent movement).  Add to that, the buttons are underneath the touchpad.  This does add to some cool features but try to click on some tab and the cursor moves.  I would prefer dedicated buttons like many other units have.  I have looked for adjustments, thinking maybe the sensitivity could be lowered.  I have adjusted the speed to where I'm comfortable with.  ... This touchpad is larger (a plus) and there are many cool features and gestures that can be customized (a big plus), but the core of moving cursor around and have it stop on a tab or slider and this thing just coasts off. So I'm finding myself often micro adjusting the cursor, which I've never done on other units.  I think some setting where one could turn off the pad on the area above the 'buttons' might be an answer.  Meanwhile - workaround - use a mouse and all of the above problems go away.  ... Technique(?)  perhaps, and maybe this touchpad is just supersensitive to my movements, so when I think I've stopped moving it keeps moving to edge of finger tip(?) .  Still, I'd prefer dedicated buttons.\n\nKeypad -  it's OK.  The keys feel fine and are quieter than my other unit, but the other unit was better to type on and more comfortable.  True, nothing beats a good keyboard and most laptops aren't known for that.  The frame of the 1520 was curved down on the edge - where the wrists are - and this one is a corner.  It just feels like poor posture.  I'm using it now to type this review.  Is this a big deal?, probably not.  If I was going to be consistently writing I might consider a wrist pad or something.  One big Plus - in the whole time of typing, not once has the cursor jumped around, unlike the other unit. This in part due to placement of touchpad to keyboard and adjusting settings.\n\nBacklit Keys - This option has been around for a while.  It's standard here.  White light in color and brightness is adjustable, 3 settings ( On, Off, middle).  They do fade out or on, so that's cool\n\nSpeakers - a little better than what I had.  Any music or movies I would plug in to stereo, headphones, or work radio.  Let's be fair here, some others have complained, but there's not much room in a laptop for a great sound system and for the price, it's good.\n\nMonitor - I got the FHD 1920x1068 res.  There is a 4k touchscreen option.  While movies and some apps would benefit, others not so much.  Battery life may be shortened and expect the screen to be constantly full of smudges.  I have a tablet and smart phone, although they have screen protectors on them.  Overall, I'm pleased.  Again, I know there are better, brighter screens out there.  I have not used a calibration tool here (recommended for working on photos or videos).\n\nMemory - 8 gb.  Take note, those interested in expanding.  There are 2 memory slots, only 1 is filled with an 8gb, as compared to 2 4gb.  So adding on doesn't require selling parts online.  What's in it is Hynix DDR3L (note the 'L', it's also marked inside next to memory).  I just bought an 8gb stick from Kingston - ( KTD-L3CL-8g for those interested).  This will not take DDR4 mem.  You can get that in other gaming units, but expect to may more.  I'm pleased.\n\nSSD storage- This is great. It's cool, quiet, and faster than previous 7200rpm drive (which is faster than 5400rpm).  Also take note - this is in mSata slot, thus freeing the hd bay for a 2nd drive, be it another ssd or disk.  I was able to add a 1tb hybrid 5400rpm from another computer last night.  It took, basically plug & play.  I adjusted partitions and did a format, then moved photos and such over.  Yes, I realize that it adds to weight (slightly) and noise (low) and may be a drain to battery (not sure how much). Yes, I'm at risk of losing lots of data if computer goes swimming or something.  That's why and external drive or 2 is a great idea.  Also,  I do have the option of removing it and storing it, if the need arises\n\nGraphic card -  I'm not a real gamer.  If I was,  there are better units with much faster processors and dual cards.  For that matter, get a desktop version.  You get more room, better cooling, better components, etc...  Still, some apps perform smoother and there is the occasional game.  Some reviews have mentioned that they could have added the 970 or 980.  Perhaps, but keep in mind they use more energy and run warmer and cost more.  There is a 965 that has better performance and is more in line with the 960.  Whatever, this unit is above average and can hold it's own and then some and for under $800, that's hard to beat.  Plus, from a company perspective, they order in large batches and they are 'hard-wired' in. Hence pre-builds.  That's partly why they may direct customers to their gaming units, which have the better components and such.\n\nWeight - This is lighter than the 1520 with 12cell battery, heavier than the Kindle Fire, and is very light compared to some tools I carry around.  My take - we are talking about a few pounds total and ounces of differences between other 15\" laptops. Lift some weights or carry some cameras with large lenses and all of a sudden this laptop seems like air  LoL.  If that's a concern, then do without the 2nd drive, graphic card and consider a 13\" or a tablet.  Actually, if bulk is a problem, then I'd do what I could with my smart phone (sorry, but my Kindle seems slow even though I like it)\n\nOne minor irritant with Microsoft Edge (windows) is that they reset to minimum size after a video is played or a reboot.  I've installed Chrome and that seems to be stable in that respect.  I tend to open lots of tabs when reading news articles, Edge seems multiple times better than IE ever was, hence I used Chrome, but Chrome tends to suck up memory when multiple tabs are open.  Edge is slightly better so far.  This computer is notably faster when scrolling through sites than old one, even on a slow network. For office, I installed LibreOffice.  It's open source, some friends use it in their business.  I'm a newbie with this, but just thought I'd mention it.\n\nWireless- Works, sort of... There have been a few times, when it appears connected, but isn't.  Phone and tablet are on.  Check settings, turn off/on wireless and it's good, but slow.  Plug in with cable and all is fine.  I've read some, and others have mentioned similar in reviews.  Might do an update soon, I've been busy...  Older one could get weak signals in back rooms, this one detects them, but... yah, that's it.\n\nSince I bought this, the price dropped $40.  Amazon adjusted.  That basically paid for extra memory.  :)  I ordered on a Saturday and it was delivered end of next Tuesday (2 business days).  Short of going to some big box store and getting one off the shelf, this was faster than other places that would take a week or so.\n\nAll in all, I'm pleased with this setup, save for those kinks.  It had the core of what I was looking for -- a 15\" monitor, ssd with room for a 2nd drive, graphic card that wasn't a room heater, enough memory, and fast processor (newer intel i5 or i7).  It met this at a good price."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "This laptop has been in my possession for about a week. I can't say much more than this product really does meet my expectations. I've played Payday 2, Minecraft, Warhammer Vermintide, Rust, and a few other games on Steam. I've installed a text editor and some GNU tools to do school projects and it really outperforms the iMacs at my school and my Work i7 Intel Machine (i7, 8GB RAM, Ubuntu). If you are looking for an everyday workhorse, this is too over powered. If you're tired of waiting for your machine to respond, get the recommended 8GB 12800 speed Extra stick of RAM and you'll be PLENTY happy. The only complaint I have is the touchpad which judging by the other reviewers is about the same issue with too sensitive or not sensitive enough. I really just decided to use a external mouse instead and it doesnt bug me. The rubberized casing is a nice touch but my hands get greasy and you can see where I've held the unit.\n\nAside from one slight touchpad issue (which I REALLY HONESTLY don't care to use anyway) and cosmetics cause of my hands getting greasy. This unit is definitely worth every penny. (bought black friday 2015 for ~$759)\n\n********************** ORIGINAL REVIEW: ****************************\nAs a owner of the device all of six hours, I've gotten the machine setup to my liking. The rubberized wrist rests are a step up from my ASUS K52Dr. This system can handle Dying Light no problem on High for a solid 45 FPS. Payday 2 sat at an easy 75 FPS. The speakers blew me away and the built in subwoofer makes gunshots reverberate through the casing.\n\nVideo quality is absolutely amazing and everything is very crisp. I've loaded in Sublime Text 3 and got my development area setup nicely with a few steam games and WinSCP. I bumped the RAM to 16 GB which was SO simple I cannot recommend it enough. I can see where people were complaining about the mousepad, but get a cheap wireless mouse and you will never need to work with it, not that it isn't workable at all.\n\nThe keyboard feels nice and keeps my buttons silent. The backlight is a nice plus from my six year old laptop. I went in for a gaming laptop and definitely found one inside this Dell Laptop. Plus, it doesnt look bad at all.\n\nBattery Life is substantial. I've only turned it off for about an hour where I installed the RAM and moved the unit from one house to another. I had a full charge as of 8:45 PM and it is currenly 1:30 AM with 38% (Windows is registering 2hr 38mins remaining)"}

Considering that I think little over a month should do just fine.\nFor starters before buying any performance centered laptop the most important point to keep in mind is display. It's imperative that the display is good because isn't that the point after all. The final outcome is to be displayed so displays gotta be good and this one fits the bill just fine. It's a full HD display and the bleed at the bottom that everyone's talking about. Please don't bother. You'll notice it only when you boot and that's about it. I wouldn't call it flawless but the display sure is nice especially from the gaming and watching videos prospective. Now coming to the performance. This thing's a beast in every sense. Let's say you aren't a hardcore gaming but use you laptop for the casual use and the ocassional performance intensive stuff. You'll notice how swift this laptop irrespective of anything. So the specs provided by dell will be more than sufficient for all kinds of work. For those gamers out there who care about it the fps they get at full settings. Bumping up the ram will do the trick. The ssd is swiftsofteares. For those who watch TV shows, multiple games nothing to worry. There's a slot to bump up the memory too.\nNow I was wondering how dell managed to reach such a competitive price point for such a good specs laptop. They might have compromised with the built quality. Yes the compromise is definitely there but well you'll live with it. The plastic feels flimsy and cheap at times but the laptop as a whole is definitely sturdy. The feel of the keyboard is nice and the backlight feature will come in handy and sure adds a nice touch. Now this laptop runs surprisingly cool. Even with hours of gaming or graphic intensive softwares like adobe Photoshop or AutoCAD this things runs cool as a cucumber. This might be a little far fetched but it's not. I've used quite a few laptops and I'll tell you this. Cooling on this laptop is astonishing. Better cooling means longer battery life. Lastly the battery life. This thing has a huge 74wh battery under it's chassis. With normal usage you'll get around 7-8 hours of usage and with intensive performance oriented work little over three an a half hours.\nLastly all those ppl wining about the WiFi issues. Common guys it's simple to fix at what you are getting for the price point is a steal anyway. So I'd just say\nBuy this one without thinking I'll too much"}

This enables you to upgrade the storage and memory quite easily. I have already popped in an extra 500gb SSD for gaming's sake and can upgrade the memory at any time if needed.\n\nThis computer does have a backlit keyboard and you should also update all your drivers through device manager the moment you begin using this laptop.\n\nI am now satisfied with my purchase! :) I just wish I hadn't had to go through a faulty product first.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI really do like this computer.\n\nIt is strong enough to give me consistent performance on all the games that I've been playing (Fallout 4, etc.) and it has been working splendidly for all my web browsing needs.\n\nI have one major gripe though, and I am pretty sure it is a defect in the hardware itself. It is also a deal breaker unfortunately, and I am now looking to either replace or return this laptop. Within the screen, there is a habitual diagonal line from the top left corner to the bottom right corner that tears the monitor's image. It appears when I am moving images on the screen and it happens when I am playing games, watching movies, or even just scrolling a web page. Granted, it doesn't happen all the time, but that just makes it more confusing as to what could be causing it.\n\nI've included a video of this phenomenon. I also used a screen recorder to record it, but it doesn't show up on the recording so I'm even more sure that it is a hardware defect.\n\nAs the entire interface is based around the monitor, I really can't stand it. How would I go about contacting the seller?"}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "The laptop seems to be decently powerful, but I guess the piece that I got was defective. Returend it to Amazon as its screen was bleeding in dark pictures on the upper and lower edges. Also the Backlit keyboard light was not working at all. When contacted Dell the representative asked me if i was comfortable fixing the new keyboard myself, that they will send to me through mail. SERIOUSLY? Does Dell think that I spent >$800 for defective laptop? What a poor DELL customer service.\n\nI was wondering how come Dell has started give such high config laptop in such competitive range? The answer is the very cheap quality of plastic used for body of the laptop. The outer cover of the screen is not at all sturdy. It feels very weak. Even if I try to adjust your screen angle by holding/pushing the bezel of the screen, I could see the changes of color/more bleeding on the screen. Horrible and cheap quality material used. Same is true for Screen quality. While adjusting the screen sometime I felt I may damage it permanently/or atleast some pixels/ columns will go dead.  Mouse pad is below average, my current Dell Studio 1558 has much better mouse pad than this.\nSpeakers are ok, but its subwoofer is seriously a joke. My current Dell Studio which is 5 years old has better sound quality.\n\nPerformance wise I have not tested this laptop much, as I was very much disappointed with the build quality of the laptop and had to drop it at UPS store same day when I opened return case with Amazon. Dell just ruined my Black Friday. Although the Amazon service is great and they do stand by their words. That was the reason i bought it from Amazon."}

For the price, you get a laptop that can handle the latest games like Star Wars:Battlefront as well as an SSD Hard Drive which can be upgraded with the second open hard drive slot. However, the criticism that I have with the laptop is not the build quality itself (except for the trackpad, its pretty bad but I use a mouse) but the Windows 10 OS that comes with the laptop. As of November 2015, Windows 10 has numerous issues relating to wifi connectivity as well as freezing at intervals of 10-15 seconds whenever you put the computer into sleep mode. For these issues, I don't blame the laptop but, I would love it they offered earlier versions of Windows which do not have these stability issues. Otherwise, the laptop would receive 5 stars but these annoyances are enough to merit criticism."}

The track pad/touch pad on this thing is just pure awful.

The light bleed happens at the bottom slightly, but it is noticeable only during boot time and I can live with it.\n\nI'm thinking adding a 256 Gb SSD in the future, in addition to the present one.\n\nBattery lasts for about 7-8 hours on slight-moderate usage(browsing and watching videos).

I have the basic model from dell website with 1tb hybrid hard drive, and it's still pretty fast when you turn it on or off. It might slow compared with SSD version when you try to load games, but it's still fast enough for me. The issue I encounter just like other commenters have pointed out 1. wifi issue 2. when you surf on some graphic intense website, an error message will pop up when I use I.E.

Long battery life.  Very minimal bloatware. Decent speakers. Serviceable trackpad.\n\nCouldn't ask for anything more honestly.  I bought this for my wife because her old Toshiba Satellite A505-S6004 began to go out and cause her trouble every day. She isn't a hardcore gamer but she does enjoy playing Hearthstone.  That being said, I wanted to get her something that would could play most anything (at variable settings) should she decide to branch out and try more games.  Apart from gaming, I wanted her to have something that was going to let her perform all of the general day-to-day computing that anyone may do: email, streaming music/video, browsing the web, etc.  Of course this laptop is able to do it all with ease.  I also like that there is room to add more memory and another hard drive.\n\nMy wife and I are extremely happy with this laptop.  I would highly recommend it to anyone.\n\n*****************************************************************************************************************\n**** UPDATE: 9 MONTHS AFTER PURCHASE -- PLEASE READ UPDATED REVIEW BELOW ****\n*****************************************************************************************************************\n\nI had to come back here to update my review on this Dell 15.6\" Inspiron 15 7559-763BLK laptop because this thing died fast.\n\nThis laptop started off appearing to be of high quality but as time went on it failed big time.  As some others have point at, the left screen hinge is defective and broke on our unit which causes the entire left side of the laptop to open up several inches, exposing the motherboard and other internal components.  Unless you forcefully push the left side back down it remains exposed -- and good luck keeping it there.  My wife had to take some panty hose and use it to attempt to keep the thing together.  If the hinge breaking wasn't bad enough, the Wifi antenna is on the left side of the machine so apparently the stress of the hinge break and the entire left side of the machine opening up has caused the WifI antenna to get a maximum range of about 6 feet from the access point.  Additionally, the bluetooth has failed.\n\nApartment from the hardware issues, Windows 10 will randomly freeze for anywhere from 15 seconds to sometimes so long that you just have to hold in the power button to forcefully shut it down.  I'm a tech guy -- have my A+, Network+, MCP and several other old MS certs --  I've updated the BIOS to the very latest revision, completely wiped the SSD and done a fresh install of Windows 10 and updated all drivers to the latest version including the latest Geforce drivers which, as of today, 9/16/16 is at 372.70 (which was released on 8/29/16).\n\nI've been working on computers for the better part of 30 years -- our unit is a total lemon and from the reports I've read from others, this entire skew is essentially garbage.  Just take a look at the 1 and 2 star reviews.  This laptop has MAJOR quality control issues.  I bought this as a gift for my wife and we're both extremely dissappointed.  I don't have any experience with this type of thing, but we are seriously considering contacting a lawyer to see if there is any possibility of legal action considering that there appears to be a high failure rate with this laptop.\n\nI'm serious folks, stay far away from this laptop.  We're out $820 dollars, but you don't have to be."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "Well, here are my thoughts on the laptop after several day having it. I will probably end up keeping the laptop. I haven't seem anything at this price point with these specs. I mainly use the laptop while on the couch. I use it to surf the web and have been playing Fallout 4 on it. So, here are my impressions on the different components.\n\n1. Screen - I think this is my biggest gripe.  I believe I have the  LG panel in this laptop. Its a decent screen. From what I know there are two panels that come with this laptop. I did have to create two different profiles because of the screen. I created a web surfing and a game profile. The web surfing profile is turned down(brightness) with good color. I find this profile very acceptable. If I try to run FO4 with this profile, I cant see a thing when it is night. This is is the reason for a game profile with full brightness with everything turned up. If I leave this profile active when web surfing everything is washed out and unbearable, but again this profile is suitable for games. It could also be FO4 too. I cant turn up brightness ingame. Hey, maybe order a better panel in the future...\n\n2. Keyboard - I think its fine maybe because I use chicklet type keyboards. I do have a mechanical keyboard that I use with my gaming rig, but the keyboard on the laptop is fine. I do use a Dell work laptop which I dislike because the amount of flex involved with the keyboard. The back-lit keys are a bonus too.\n\n3. Speakers - I find the speakers lackluster on the laptop. Again, they are laptop speakers, so I wasn't expecting anything great. I will get a pop/distortion every now and then when watching youtube. I have messed with the Dell audio settings and that seems to help somewhat. I do use a lower profile bluetooth speaker, it sits on the laptop when I play games. Bluetooth speaker is 10x better.\n\n4. Battery - The battery is great! If you are just surfing the web with about 75 percent brightness, it will last 6-8 hours on the battery. For a laptop this big, I was expecting 3-4 hours. That big battery helps! Of course, if I'm are playing games I always have the power cord plugged in.\n\n5. Trackpad - I'm indifferent here. I never use trackpads on laptops. I have always used a mouse and will still use a mouse. For the couple of times I have used it, its works ok. I haven't had any issues with it. I guess if I used it exclusively, I would have more comments on it.\n\n6. Gameplay - The gpu just chugs along. I've only played FO4 on it and it does a pretty good job. I think I'm playing with the majority of setting on high. I get around 40-45 fps which is fine with me.\n\nI think that's all the major components. I have also added another SSD and different wifi card. I will be ordering another stick of memory this week. I have updated all drivers and the bios too. Overall, for what you get and pay for, it was a great value for me. I'm still looking at other gaming laptop, but I cant seem to find anything better at the moment. thanks..."}

I pulled the trigger when the price dropped from $799 to $759. However, I've had a simply awesome experience! since this arrived about a week ago. I had a 2007 Latitude E6400 as my only laptop till I bought this, so this has been a joy to use in comparison.\n\nIf you're on the fence because of concerns about drivers/updates, I can only say that I have had zero issues in this regard. The other complaint is that the trackpad is bad. I personally don't like ANY trackpads, but this one seems fine. It's responsive, had a nice matte feel to it, and just works. Get a usb or wireless mouse if you don't like the trackpad and don't let that stop you from owning this really excellent machine.\n\nI'm a very casual gamer, so running games at max settings wasn't super important. I just wanted to be able to run newer games for the occasions when I have time to play. Far Cry 4 and StarCraft II both run great using the GEForce optimized settings, and Fallout 4 runs great at 1080p though the settings have to be set to \"low\". Sadly, the GEForce Experience lets you know that the system hardware just can't handle the optimized settings for Fallout 4.\n\nAlso, it's lightweight, slim enough, and quiet enough that my wife doesn't feel like she's hauling around a giant gaming laptop, so thankfully I'm in the clear there. :)"}

Fuzzy speakers seems to be an issue reported by other reviewers; hopefully mine don't end up crapping out.\n\nWhy keep this laptop if I'm worried some components might fail anyway? I honestly think it's a gamble. This computer has great specs for the price, but it seems clear that Dell did cut some corners to bring down the price so much. That being said, here are the things below that I like:\n\n- The screen. It does have some backlight bleed near the bottom, but it doesn't affect my daily operation at all. I love that the screen is matte and I think the colors look great. At work, I'm on an enormous iMac with a retina screen all day. I got a much cheaper laptop recently with a dull screen and horrible viewing angles and I seriously couldn't handle it. With this screen, however, I'm not bothered at all. Considering what I'm used to, I would say it's good. The only annoyance is that the text in the general Windows UI (like Device Manager, and installers, not the sleek-looking Windows 10 embellishments) is fuzzy; this is because it is automatically upscaled to 125% and thus looks a bit pixelated. Clear-type doesn't seem to work in this case. Text in other apps and games looks great, even though it is also at 125%. I tried bringing it down to 100%. All text is clear in this case, but way too small for me to read.\n\n- Battery lasts long enough for me to chill in my favorite chair for several hours browsing reddit without getting up to plug the computer in, so I love it. I plan on keeping it plugged in to play video games, so I can't speak to how long the battery will last when the computer is used for more intense tasks.\n\n- I haven't actually played any games on it, though if I run into any issues I'll be sure to report. I HAVE worked on some intense Illustrator files that are slow on my $2000 computer at work. With the SSD, which was probably the #1 reason I bought this computer, working on the files was like slicing through butter. It's awesome.\n\n- I like the keyboard. The keys are a bit spaced out and I have small hands, but I don't seem to be bothered by it.\n\n- I like that accessing the back of the laptop to upgrade the RAM and storage is so simple. It's great. The cheaper laptop I bought a while ago would really benefit from an SSD, but just taking the back off is an arduous task, not to mention even getting to the hard drive. With this laptop, it is super simple.\n\nThings I don't like:\n\n- Speakers, due to the popping as noted earlier. Otherwise they are pretty robust, but they clearly have some issues.\n\n- Touchpad is awful, as others have noted. They aren't lying.\n\nIf it weren't for the speakers, and the fact that I worry this product suffers from some quality control issues, I'd rate it 5 stars.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPREVIOUS REVIEW: Right now my review is 1 star because the sound didn't work right out of the box. I updated all of the drivers and BIOS, etc., but still no audio devices were detected. I uninstalled and reinstalled drivers. The Realtek audio driver that came installed and then the Realtek audio driver that I reinstalled from Dell's support website both were never once detected by the Device Manager. I even reset the computer to Factor Settings, concerned I had messed something while initially updating the drivers. The sound still didn't work. My guess is a bad sound card or some other hardware issue. I've read the negative reviews, and it seems this otherwise impressive laptop suffers from poor quality control on Dell's part.\n\nBut due to the largely favorable reviews, I'm returning this one for a replacement in the hopes I'll get one of the good ones. This laptop is indeed good. I couldn't test any games I wished to test, as there was no audio device detected and they wouldn't run. But I did try out some usually taxing and slow files in Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop, and the laptop's performance is as smooth as butter.\n\nI will modify my review once the replacement arrives. Amazon customer service was awesome. I emailed them detailing my issue, and they sent a replacement right away."}

The new Skylake, 6th generation i5 processor coupled with 8GB of RAM and SSD booted Windows 10 very quickly. However I unfortunately landed some hardware problems with my unit.\n\nI quickly replaced Windows with Xubuntu (Linux distribution) as most of my work is done on Linux. It worked for a few hours, but then, when I restarted the computer, a Dell BIOS alert quickly popped up saying that some hardware was going to fail soon. I pressed continue, and then Linux started reporting hardware failures. Finally, when I booted into the actual operating system, I ran a disk assessment check using gnome-disk-utility and it too reported that the SSD would soon fail.\n\nThe moral of this story: run a SMART test on your SSD when you get your laptop to make sure everything is really OK, otherwise you may run into problems as well down the line.\n\nI will update my review when I get my new unit."}

I always expect a few software issues to fix just because I'm sure they are dated as soon as the computer is manufactured and shipped.  I pre-ordered this and wasn't sure what I was going to get, but I didn't want to spend over $1000 to have a serious machine.

Its been playing both Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas at Ultra High Definition graphics and runs phenomenally.  I have yet to feel the heat under my left hand while playing, unlike my older laptop which used to get pretty hot.  It boots up very fast still, and while connected to Wi-Fi (Comcast) here in Utah its blazing speeds.  \"Impressive... most impressive...\"\n\nQUESTION:  Has anyone tried to connect any Bluetooth devices to this yet?  I am considering using some wireless headphones but would appreciate someone's experience on this subject.  Thanks!\n\nLike \"Spaceballs\" once said,  it takes me to Ludicrous Speed.\n\nI added another 240GB SSD in the open area, which was plug and play basically and another 8GB RAM which was just as simple, it's amazing.  For the price, I honestly cannot find anything that comes close.  Windows 10.1 has been phenomenal,  beautiful IPS display, bluetooth,  very fast wireless with an ethernet port for options, USB 3.0, HDMI, Backlit keyboard (I wish it was colored red instead of white), subwoofer and speakers are better than I thought, two fans help to easily mitigate heat problems but I still have it sitting on a laptop fan mat just in case (old habit), and the rubbery feeling coating is nice and comfortable.  I wish it had a quick click on and off button to deactivate and reactivate  the touch pad.\n\nSo far, I'm extremely pleased with this product and would shout from the rooftops to also purchase one.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "I really like this laptop.  It is fast, quiet, and cool.  It starts up in around 5 seconds.  If it has a fan, I have never heard it.  Unlike previous gaming laptops I have owned, this one makes no noise, and it puts out very little heat.  If I am playing a GPU intensive game, then it is slightly warm to the touch, but I have never had it get hot. I looked up the GPU before I bought it and it is one of the best rated GPUs for the money.  I have used a HDMI cable to watch stuff on my big screen TV, and it looks great.  The performance is really good.  I play Civ V and the computer turns complete almost instantly in the beginning of the game, and take around 10 seconds per player towards the end of the game on a huge map That is about 1/3 of the time that my previous computer took.  I am attaching a scan of the paper that came with the laptop that shows the various ports.  The laptop is matte black with red trim.  The only down side is that the black matte shows fingerprints really easily.  They come off with Windex and a paper towel.  I recommend this laptop for casual game players.  If you are only web browsing, it is more than you need.  If you are a competitive game player, you should save your money for a Dell Alien-ware."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "At this point Amazon customer service gets 6 stars out of 5, but Dell customer service was very disappointing.  Based on all the positive reviews that I read before ordering, I took a chance on returning my order for a replacement.\n\nHere's what went wrong at Dell -- the cable that came for the brick provided kept falling out of the brick and couldn't be pushed on far enough to be secure while the other end would less frequently fall out of the laptop.  Though it had a blue light at the laptop end showing that it was live, it did not charge the computer and resulted in a message that said \"The AC power adapter is not recognized.  System performance will be impacted.  Please connect the correct Dell AC power adapter for best system operation.\"\n\nAfter being told the estimated wait time to talk to customer service was 15 min, I spent more than 40 min on hold waiting to talk to a Dell rep before I got, \"Sorry, customer support is now closed, call back tomorrow.\"  After about 20 min on hold, I'd also tried to initiate a chat.  After being lured into thinking that would work by seeing a countdown of the number ahead of me in the queue, the door was slammed shut with me and 50 or so other folks still in line.\n\nSo this AM, I wasted all morning trying to get to someone to tell me what they could do and to get a pdf of the warranty that had to be agreed to but couldn't be printed or saved when setting up the computer.  The last Dell rep I spoke with suggested returning the system -- at last, an honest attempt to help.\n\nAnother problem was that the Wifi I'd turned off randomly decided to turn itself back on.  (I'd turned off Wifi to use an Ethernet cable as I was too lazy to dig out the password for my router and a connected cable was right at hand.)  Then, the computer suddenly decided that it couldn't see the Ethernet cable that was plugged in and that had been used all along for web access.  ???\n\nAnd then again, the name change for the computer that was supposed to take on reboot didn't take after 2 or 3 cold boots.\n\nOn the positive side, I found the touchpad much more manageable than I'd expected based on other reviews here, until that is, every program in the world decided to try to update itself, then it became a total mess, even though windows Task Manager showed memory use never over 39% and only periodic spikes up to about 80% in CPU use.  Not sure what may be Windows 10 problems rather than hardware problems.\n\nI will update after I receive the replacement box.  I appreciate everyone who has posted reviews here.  I found all of them most helpful in my buying decision.\n\nUPDATE:  12/10/2015\nI received the replacement several days ago and it came with a brick that plugs into and recharges the computer.  However, the cord from the outlet to the brick(A/C adapter) still falls out all the time.  The touchpad goes haywire when some program sucks up most of the computer resources, but its been hard to pin down which of the pre-loaded programs tend to cause the problems. WiFi now working fine, haven't tried Ethernet yet.  Haven't put any other software on the system yet as am still evaluating the computer itself, but so far, seems Ok aside from the problems noted. Upping the rating to three stars for now from previous one star."}

This laptop was able to get me through a couple of game of league of legends perfectly but afterwards returned to freezing. The only reason I gave it three stars and not four or five was due to it freezing. I have returned and order a replacement.  Hopefully it comes out perfect and I will change to score.\nEdit 2: So I received the replacement laptop and I am still having freezing issues. Although after much research I have discovered it is not due to the laptop but due to Windows 10. W10 has a ton of issues and although the laptop is perfect the Window 10 ruins the experience. I might keep it and deal with the freezing but if you are in the market for a laptop make sure you get one without windows 10 to have a better experience."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "I bought this laptop from Amazon (used wife's account since she has Prime) because it was basically exactly what I was looking for: at least a quad Core Intel processor, at least 8gb RAM, at least a 256gb SSD, at least a 950M, all with a price tag under $1000. I'd been looking for a while, but most laptops I found were missing one thing or another and were often far more expensive all things considered. For the money ($759.99 as I write this), I really don't believe there is a better price for performance gaming laptop available.\n\nPros:\n-Price. I really don't see any other laptop coming close to this machine in terms of value and price for performance. This laptop has everything on my wish list at $200 below what I was expecting to pay. Yeah, that's a pro.\n-This machine has a quad core i5 rather than a dual core, so you get that added performance compared to a dual core i5 (that would be an i5 that doesn't have \"HQ\" at the end). A quad core i7 would be even better, but is the addition of hyper threading (the real difference between an i5 and i7), which really isn't all that helpful for games, worth another $200?  I don't think so. In my experience over the last week, this laptop delivers the speed I need and I barely notice the difference between it and my custom desktop with a Core i5 3750k.\n-The GPU, a 960m, is a really solid performer. You will not be maxing out the latest first person shooters on this GPU, but you shouldn't be expecting that in any laptop under $1300. I got this laptop to play slightly older and/or slightly less demanding games, like Smite, Divinity Original Sin: Enhanced Edition and other similar games. It plays the games I want at a consistent and smooth 60+ frames per second with the graphics settings turned way up. I'll have to test it with games like GTA V and Crysis to see what it can deliver, but I think it will do fine as long as I adjust the graphics a bit.  Sure, a 970m would perform better, but again, is that worth another $150-200? 4GB of VRAM is overkill though. I can't imagine any game that would need 4GB of VRAM at settings the 960m is capable of delivering at 1080P. Would have liked to see them drop it down to 2GB VRAM and maybe increase the size of the SSD or drop the price even more.\n-The Solid State Drive.  SSDs are basically an essential component of any computer for me these days. I just can't imagine waiting for a regular old hard drive to boot or load things anymore. Based on benchmarks, this isn't a top end SSD, but, again, you shouldn't be expecting that in a sub $800 laptop. That said, the SSD in this computer is going to blow away any 1TB hard drive you get in most competitors in this price range. The computer also has an easily accessible slot for another SSD, making upgrades a cinch. I'll keep my eye out for a mid-range SSD in the 500gb-1TB range for under $150 or $200 and be completely set on this machine.\n-8GB RAM - this is just the right amount of RAM at the moment and probably for the near future. 16GB is nicer, but, in my opinion, not worth the up charge since you aren't likely to need it if you run things this computer is best suited to run.\n-Look and feel - I personally really like the way this laptop feels. It has a rubberized exterior that feels nice to the touch and doesn't get instantly covered in finger prints. It is heavy, but its a gaming laptop, so that's to be expected - this is not an ultra-portable machine, so don't come in expecting that. In a backpack, you won't really notice the difference.\n-Screen (but see cons) - People have knocked the screen a bit (and I will too down below), but for a sub $800 laptop, the screen is really solid. It is an IPS screen and to my non-professional eyes, the colors look fine. The pixels are generally sharp and you don't have to be sitting dead center to get a good picture. I could seriously understand Dell tossing in a cheap TN panel to make the sub $800 price point, but they didn't, so I'll list this as (mostly) a pro.\n\nMiddle ground -\n-Keyboard and trackpad. The keyboard is just fine for me. I have absolutely no issues typing on it. I'm used to all kinds of keyboards and am not terribly picky. The trackpad is also fine, if not amazing. I haven't had a ton of issues with it. I think the biggest adjustment is not keeping my finger on the left click part of the track pad since that seems to throw off the tracking.\n-Thickness - this laptop is a teeny bit chunky. Definitely an understandable result of Dell trying to hit the low price point since they didn't have the budget to engineer a slightly smaller build. Generally, this really isn't an issue since this isn't an ultra portable. I only really noticed it when I tried to fit it into a Case Logic laptop sleeve for a generic 15.6 inch laptop. It fit, but rather snuggly. As with some of the other items in this review, this is a compromise I will gladly make to get a laptop this powerful under $800.\n\nCons\n-Issues out of the box. This is pretty straightforward - the Wifi does not work well out of the box. You will need to plug in an Ethernet cable and be sure to download the latest Wifi and other drivers to get the best experience. Once I updated the drivers I had zero issues playing hour of multiplayer online games this past weekend - not one wifi issue once I updated the drivers. The built-in wifi card maxed out my home's 50mbs internet on downloads from Steam, so yeah, it works well. Just wish it worked well out of the box.\n-Screen backlight bleed. This is where it becomes evident that Dell made a few compromises to hit this aggressive price point. On booting the machine up, which shows a black screen with a Dell logo in the middle, there is basically backlight bleed all around the screen. This would be distracting if I were watching a lot of letterboxed movies, but I never noticed it once I started playing games and using the computer generally.\n\nI took off one star since it is bad to ship a laptop with bad drivers (though the problem is easily fixed), and the backlight bleed is disappointing (but not that distracting in normal use). I can't let Dell get away for free with two issues like that. This is really a 4.5 star review, but there's no option for that.\n\nOverall, I hope you see why I think this is a really solid computer at $800. I think it would easily still be a good value at even $900 or $1000 - it just feels like a steal at $759. You just can't get this processor, GPU, 8gb RAM and a solid state drive at less than $800. If an SSD isn't a big deal for you, you may be able to get something in this price range, but I really think the SSD is worth it. I have no regrets on this laptop. I know I have a capable machine that will last me for years based on how I will use it.\n\nPlease send me any questions. Happy to answer them if I can."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "After about 2 weeks of use, I can say that this is a very well built machine and that it is a very smart purchase if you compare the quality and components you are getting and the price you are paying. Being honest with you, I was considering a laptop twice the price (the ASUS ROG G751) to be able to do some gaming. The ASUS would have been a Porsche 911, but I decided to get a reliable Lexus or Acura instead. I'm glad I only paid $759 for a very capable machine at the time of my purchase. It is lightweight. The screen looks very good from all angles and the images are very vivid. I think the screen hinge looks pretty well built too. Please consider that you are getting an Intel i5 processor, 8GBs of DDR3L RAM with an empty RAM slot available for expansion, a 256GB Solid State Drive (SSD) in an M.2 form factor which is even faster and lighter weight than the most popular 2.5 inches cousin. This means that you still have a slot for a 2.5 inch drive for future expansion. You also get an NVidia GTX 960M graphics processor which allows to play a very good range of modern games with ease, but I haven't used it for gaming yet. The keyboard is good and I think the mousepad is very good, but like most laptops, you will enjoy driving your Dell i7559 with a quality wireless mouse like the Logitech MX Performance which is a very good investment if you buy it for $30s-$40s, even if used in good condition. The sound is very good too. I was actually surprised for how loud it can go, but you will notice \"speaker vibration\" in some occasions if the volume is too high on some specific types of sounds. Overall, I think the sound is pretty powerful. Regarding fan noise, I still haven't heard this laptop running at all after using it for 2 weeks in normal use without gaming. I have it on a memory foam lap desk without blocking its ventilation.\n\nFriendly advice --- Update all your hardware drivers through \"Device Manager\" just after you are done with all the initial setup of your laptop including the access to an Internet connection. This will ensure you have the latest software that controls each hardware component of your laptop.\n\nI do it manually like this --- Write \"Device Manager\" in the \"Ask Me Anything\" toolbar of Windows 10, or tell Cortana to look it up for you. This will open a window showing you groups of all the hardware components of your new laptop. Open these groups by clicking on the arrows to show all the devices in each group. For example, the first group is called \"Audio inputs and outputs\". Once you open it, right click on each device, like \"Microphone\", and select \"Update Driver Software...\". Select \"Search automatically for updated driver software\" and Windows 10 will do the work for you when you tell it to go ahead and update the driver. It will take you some time, but you will be certain that your new machine is operating the best way possible.\n\nEnjoy your Dell i7559!"}

Best backpack IMO, check out Targus GRID.\n\nMany other have have put up great reviews of this laptop already so I'm going to start with something I haven't seen addressed yet which is a good bag to protect your investment. My biggest problem was finding a well-fitting backpack for this laptop. I had a really hard time matching up a good bag. The problem is most bags are designed now a days for MacBooks. So when a retailer says, \"Sure your 15.6\" laptop will fit in this 15\" bag\", it won't. You may be able to squeeze the laptop into the bag but when the laptop is butting up against  the corners of the bag pushing  zippers out, there's obviously no protection there. 17\" packs are usually too loose.\n\nMessenger bags are really uncomfortable for me so I only looked for backpacks. I went to BestBuy, Walmart, Target, Office Depot, REI, BC Surf & Sport and several luggage stores finding very few acceptable packs for this laptop.  Most of the North Face packs fit way too tight. Dakine packs offered little to no padding. Ogio bags didn't fit except the loose fitting \"17 Axle model. Victorinox bags were too expensive and Tumi prices were just plain insulting. Oakley was rugged but a bit too Mad Max for my taste. Timbuk2 Command or Uptown looked great but were too small.\n\nWhat did I end up with? Targus GRID 16\" Premium http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/s/ref=is_s?k=The+Targus+16%22+Grid+Premium+32L+Backpack+ This bag fits like a glove and is totally bomb proof. It looks cool but still professional enough for the office. I absolutely love this bag. Runner up in best fitting pack for this laptop? Check out anything in the Samsonite perfect fit line. Although, I'm not confident in Samsonite quality anymore.\n-------------------------------------\n\nLaptop Review:\n\nThis is the second laptop I received as I had to return the first due to backlight bleed. I've heard other reviewers say, \"This is common. I can deal with it\", etc. Not me. It bugged the heck out of me so I returned the laptop and thanks to Amazon's awesome exchange policy, I had a problem-free replacement two days later. You do not have to settle for a screen with backlight bleed. While for some this may be a common occurrence that they deal with, IMO this is not \"normal\" it is a defect and quality control issue.\n\nWork use. I'm only 11 days in with the new laptop but it runs almost flawless. I'm primarily using this for graphic design as a cheaper alternative to a MacBook and so far so good, running Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop CC. Fast saves no lags or stutter swapping back and forth between programs. I did notice a bit of lag while using my Wacom tablet but the file was extremely large and I don't think it was the fault of the laptop. One negative I have is the trackpad feels cheap and is difficult to use. Much more so than my Dell Latitude's pad. I really think it's because the pad is too large. I have a $13 Bluetooth mouse that solved this issue.\n\nGaming. I'm a casual gamer but so far I've ran DOTA2, Hearthstone, Banner Saga and LOTRO for over a few hours at a time with no issues. Fans run very quiet. I did have an issue with LOTRO running extremely hot and loud on DX11 but I updated the Nvidia driver and it runs fine now.\n\nNegatives. The screen could be a bit brighter I suppose but not a big deal for me. I love that the keyboard lights up but because the light shine through in between the keys the characters can appear blurry at certain angles. The rubberized finish is a grease magnet even with clean hands. The screen is large and heavy but so thin that it flexes a bit too much for my taste and makes me nervous when opening or closing the lid. Honestly though, these are all irks more than issues. For the money I can't really see a better value than this unit."}

Anything else close to this is at least $200 more so this was a steal.  boots for me in 12-15 seconds(timed both plugged in and unplugged).  For regular light duty like web browsing, music, or videos I get 4-6 hours off a single charge.  For gaming it's 60-100 minutes depending on the game.  Sound volume, quality and range are decent for a laptop, not as good as my actual sound systems but better than my hp chromebook or cheaper ($30) speakers.  There is some light on the bottom of the screen but it's only visible at boot. I purchased this laptop primarily for fallout 4 and while recommended settings are low it's still completely playable at high and 15-30 fps on ultra It's not perfect and won't run anything current on max settings without occasional lag but for the price and the completeness of the package it's well worth it.\n\ntldr 10/10 would buy again.\n\nUPDATE less than a year later:  The screen on the laptop stopped responding or showing any signs of life.  after about 45 minutes on the phone with the nice support lady running through all the required tests before sending it in for warranty we deduced that the screen that was dead was dead.  I sent it in for a warranty fix, received it back aprox. 2 weeks later and it appeared to be working.  A couple days later after zero movement or heavy useage the same problem has occurred again.  For a laptop that will last a couple years this was a great deal... but it didn't.  I'm certainly going to try the warranty process again in the hopes of getting it fixed but I'm beginning to get the feeling I now own an $800 paper weight.\n\nSo finally got the warranty replacement.  Between the two times my original laptop went down I spent about a month without a laptop.  On the upside I got a pretty decent upgrade on the replacement ([...]).  That said, knowing how this all went down if I could go back and buy something else, even given the great upgrade, I would.  Over a month of down time on a product less than a year old is just unacceptable.  If this had been my business machine I would have had to buy another one or spend a month not doing my business."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "I was really ecstatic to get a brand new gaming laptop.\n\nFirst impressions were good:\n* Nice keyboard (for a laptop).  Keys have a nice, substantial feel to them.\n* The sound is also pretty decent for a laptop\n* The monitor is beautiful.  They have a very nice graphics card in this model.  It easily does 1920x1080 (1080p) and the colors look great.\n* Some games play nicely:  I've tried Dragon Age Inquisition, and Star Wars The Old Republic, and both of those play really well, and look great.\n* Because of the SSD, it also boots lightning fast, which is awesome\n* It has the expected modern features, like USB 3.0 and an HDMI video out, and you can network with either wi-fi or ethernet.\n\nOn the downside though:\n*  The disk storage, as configured, is ridiculously insufficient, especially for gaming.  If you install a few of the larger games, and nothing else, your boot disk will be full pretty much immediately.  Fortunately there is a separate internal bus for a second drive, where I installed a 1TB SSD (which was thankfully very easy to install), but still, having such a small boot drive is certainly not ideal.  Some apps just really really want to install and store data on the C drive, even when you have a second drive.\n\n*  Like others, I too have been plagued by Wi-fi problems (and it didn't exactly work brilliantly with ethernet either).  I took a bunch of time to download all the latest drivers (as per Dell), and things seem to be a bit improved, but I'm annoyed that they were so broken as shipped, and I'm not convinced the problems are completely gone either.  By comparison my dell desktop came with all the latest drivers up-to-date and has had no such problems.\n\n*  It refuses to play Fallout 4.  Immediately crashes on startup.  Owch. That hurts, as that is the game I was most looking forward to playing with the new \"gaming\" laptop.\n*  The fonts on some of my apps are really screwed up.  I'm not sure if this is more attributable to Windows 10 or the laptop itself, but it's a real annoyance.  I'm not having this problem on my Windows 10 desktop for reference.\n*  At times, the overall performance of the machine has been really slow, even while doing very mundane things, like while downloading software from Steam while reading email.  I feel like in 2015 a laptop really ought to have more than 8GB RAM.  I will have to fix that after-market.\n\nSo I dunno.  You could do worse I suppose, and this laptop is pretty inexpensive when compared to other options.  But I think for people expecting it to actually be a gaming laptop, you should probably at the very least get it with a bigger boot drive, and more RAM, and even then it won't exactly be a high performance gaming experience.  In this configuration, as shipped on Amazon, it's nearly useless imo."}

I'm now having the problems he's describing. 24hours of seemingly good working order has come to an end.  I thought the mouse was acting up, but it's not - it is freezing every 3-5 seconds as if there is an interrupt conflict (I'm sure it's a driver of some sort) and I just got the black screen and a message saying the Intel HD Graphics card recovered from an error - the machine is crap...I will return and get this one I found a bit ago: ASUS K501UX 15-inch Gaming Laptop (Intel Core i7 Processor, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD Hard Drive, Windows 10 (64 bit)), Black/Silver Metal $759.00  (virtually the same, but will check the GPU) Happy Holidays and stay away from Dell's laptop until Dell gets it right. I now believe this one was a refurbished because the battery was not seal in its plastic bag as the original laptop was last Friday.\n\nUPDATE 25NOV15:  Okay, last Friday, received this model and it was a lemon (see below) - I contacted Amazon for easy return/replacement.  They shipped and I received it yesterday (Tues - 4 days total).  I returned the lemon via local UPS store - this replacement was not w/o it problems; however, after hours of updates, removal of Macafee ((which corrupted my Netgear Wi Fi - which caused reload of its drivers and re-associating 3 other computers and my phone back to Netgear - because as soon as I Uninstalled Macafee from this laptop, it caused firewall issues on the router, caused my other systems to not \"see\" my home network; it was a pain, but going direct connect to the router LAN and going to the Netgear support site, ran diagnostics, it found the Macafee deliberate errors, reloaded the drivers and viola)), updates to NVida & wifi card drivers, creating associations to OneDrive and Dropbox - and associating Office365 - and now downloading the 28GB digital download for WoW - and having the Dell Support App run a full diagnostics - after all this - I have a few pointers:\n\n- the NumLock key (which is mentioned in other reviews) you won't know it's activated, so be careful if you use PKI/CAC smartcards and not lock your cards\n\n-  as w/ 1 other review, before I booted it, I removed the back (one screw - easy off back lid) - I installed a SanDisk 256GB SSD 2.5 (easy install) and added an 8GB stick of RAM - straight forward install - replaced back and then the moment of truth - BIOS recognized the 2nd SDD, but not Windows 10\n\n- this next point is made in another review:  what is up with the ESC/FN key vs the traditional Fn key?  what is the logic with this?  it's a crazy mindless mish-mash of pressing this one or that one to get a Function key to operate - it's insane - not an easy thing to do to adjust volume, maybe they want a \"set it and forget it\" situation...?\n\n- Use this Youtube video to get Windows to see your 2nd SDD https://youtu.be/vCjpbgivnps  if you go the long way, as I did, and simply Google \"how to get Win 10 to see your SDD\" you will get tons of forums explaining in great tech speak about this or that, a real hassle, but this vid is buried about 15-20 links below all the top links, just go here - one reviewer on Amazon tried to explained (very limited though) how to Manage your Discs, but use the Youtube vid, trust me (although you will see a dated Win OS on the vid, the actions are the same with the same click actions/texts), 2mins and you're G2G - don't struggle with MS or SanDisk sites or tech forums - this vid will correct the problem.\n\n- So, what more can I say?  I do like the soft press chiclet styled keyboard - I do like the speakers - I do like the screen - I do like the serious speed at which this laptop moves - the SSD's are amazing - as evidenced by boot ups and restarts - and during the march forward to get this laptop up & with some protection:  I installed Malwarebytes Anti-Malware Premium edition - and the download speeds were amazing and the full scan afterwards, amazingly fast.\n\n- It's lighter than the 10lb Behemoth Asus G74SX I have had for years, Which it's worked faithfully, without error since the day of purchase 15OCT2011.  If there are glitches, it's related to Windows and it's recent upgrade to 10.  The hardware has been solid. Great gaming laptop. And I get the chiclet keys and the Numlock indicator (it doesn't exist on the Asus because the number keys are always on - there is no NumLock) - I cannot give it DELL any higher than a 3, because out of the box with a build of mixed hardware with dates between this JUN and OCT - why oh why is this New laptop seemingly so error prone?  Maybe I didn't understand the SDD recognition, maybe I don't get the ESC/FN key vs the Fn key, maybe it wasn't the Macafee (but what a striking coincidence as my ISP/Wi Fi is solid), maybe I'm just a newb about all this - but I've never, ever had this many issues between 2 \"new\" laptops with one manufacturer and one model.  I want it to succeed, it has great spec's - so far I am holding my breath, rubbing my rabbit's foot, and crossing my fingers.  Below is my first experience. Thanks for reading along.\n\n20NOV15:  Well that's Great...Order this Dell a few days ago, arrived very quickly to Alaska - looked forward to getting it up and going tonight, and Viola !\n\nUnboxed, placed on table, plugged in power (the blue light lit on power cord), opened the lid, removed the protective foamy thin thingy, and pressed the power-on button, it lights up...and back light for keys lit bright, but screen remains black.\n\nNada, nothing, Zilch...and get this - It's now very late Friday night and no one at Dell Support until Monday morning....great...not sure if a great product, but by the looks of it, something's really amiss...have been w/ ASUS for years and took the chance to go back to Dell for this seemingly great spec'd product and Nada...I don't blame Amazon at All of course...maybe someone has some insight?

This is the FIRST DAY REVIEW. Will be updating as I use it more.\n\nPROS:\n-HOLY CRAP FAST GAMING!!! This laptop will run Black Ops 3 and GTA 5 in full 1080p high settings @60fps (with less than occasional drops). Not the best in graphics, but I'm not sure which games I COULDN'T run on this beast.\n\n-Super fast load times, wake/sleep is split-second fast (thanks to Intel's new Skylake processor). My Thinkpad had a i7-5500u, and this i5-6300HQ blows it out of the water. I launched a game the second that the setup was finished on first boot. Worked right out of the box.\n\n-Decent display, very sharp and crazy good viewing angles, but you get what you pay for. Nothing beyond the price.\n\n-Keyboard has a nice soft-touch feeling and is nicely spaced. Though the build quality is no where near a Thinkpad keyboard, I am very happy using this for all my typing needs.\n\n-Nice finish on the materials, almost like a soft touch rubber, but it is still plastic.\n\n-Speaker is nice and loud without distortion. Cannot distinguish the subwoofer though, almost like its not even there.\n\nCONS:\n-HORRIBLE TRACKPAD. This trackpad is big, but is inaccurate, delayed, and just makes you work harder to do simple tasks. For someone that uses a USB mouse, I always have specific tasks that are easier to use the trackpad and keyboard with, but not anymore! Wish I could magically transfer over my Thinkpad trackpad.\n-SCREEN BLEED is pretty bad, but only on totally black images like the booting screen. It is NOT a problem in any other case\n-AC cord fits loosely in the port. Not the best designed fit.\n-Heavy and bulky. This thing is NOT for use lugging around to school, work, or even the house. The AC cable is thick and heavy also.\n-Loose display hinges. Not that they are flapping every which way, but the hinges on my 6 year old HP G62 hold better to movement\n\nUPDATE 11/23:\nAfter a clean install of windows and installing all the drivers:\n-Mouse pad seems to be working a little more rationally. Started to notice how uneven the trackpad surface it, very crappy quality.\n-Display hinges seem to have tightened a bit, and are much more stable\n-Still crazy fast. Read/writing, gaming, anything you throw at this laptop it will gladly take.\n-Although there is an empty HDD bay, there are no screws included to secure the drive inside.\n\nUPADTE 12/3:\n-Getting plenty of static sounds from the speaker and sub\n-Display hinges loosened up a bit, are more wobbly\n-Mousepad is much easier to work with\n-Graphic card got an update, now is even better at playing GTA V and Black Ops 3 @1080p\n\nGot any questions? Please ask me! I will be updating Pros and Cons..."}

The display driver would occasionally crash and I'd get BSoD's seemingly for no reason. I tried everything I could to fix it, but not even factory resets helped. I returned it for a refund as I didn't want to bother trying my luck with getting a working one after reading several other reviews saying the same thing.\n\nThis is my first day with it, and so far, I haven't had any problems at all. I made sure to update all my drivers before doing anything else. It runs games beautifully, and I'm very pleased with its performance. I've tried Killing Floor 2 and Warframe so far with no problems at all on high/ ultra settings. It also runs Project M/ Super Smash Bros. Brawl with the Dolphin emulator very smoothly at the hard capped 60 fps. The GPU tends to stay in the 60s (celsius) while gaming, and reached a maximum of 72 at one point. When doing anything else that isn't intensive, it stays pretty cool.\n\nThe touchpad is just okay, not too bad. But I've been using my mouse anyways, so it wasn't really a problem or anything for me. I haven't had any issues with the keyboard, and my spacebar seems to be working fine. The screen is very nice and clear. My wireless adapter hasn't had any problems. For those of you that are having problems and have updated all your drivers, try going to device manager -> network adapters -> properties for your adapter -> power management tab and making sure the box that says \"Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power\" isn't checked.

It was pretty much everything I wanted in a laptop when it comes to specs and pricing. The screen is great, nice soft feel to the laptop, many USB ports, great backlight keyboard, loud speakers and subwoofer. There is a slight backlight bleed at the bottom when you are viewing a black screen. Comes with very little \"bloatware\", not as much as Dell used to include. 6 cell battery lasts for a very long time and it charges extremely quickly. The cooling system is amazing, it has two fans and 3 vents. It stays really cool while gaming that the fan barely has to kick it up. The weight and bulk are a bit on the hefty side but it was expected for a gaming laptop with a dedicated video card. Don't get this if you want portability.\n\nThe keyboard and touchpad will take some time to get used to. This type of keyboard has pretty large spacing between the keys like they do in Macbooks and I'm not a fan of the touchpad. The keys have a low profile, soft touch and have low feedback.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "I have nothing but good things to say about this laptop. I haven't had any of the wireless problems others have reported, where the wireless connection is continually lost. Other thoughts:\n\n1) I added a 2TB HDD for $90. It was absolutely painless; as others have reported, it was as simple as removing the back panel (held in by a single phillips screw) and plugging the new HDD in. The HDD needs to be the 2.5\" type and 9.5mm thick. After replacing the cover, I can detect no movement or rattling from the HDD - it appears to fit quite snugly.\n\n2) The back panel also provides access to the battery (it is replaceable) and the memory, which has a slot for an extra stick.\n\n3) After a lot of research, I did not add a second stick of memory. From what I've read it is overkill for most users. From both of the benchmarks I found, going from 8GB single channel to 16GB dual-channel provides only a small increase in performance UNLESS you do rigorous video encoding. The choice is up to you of course - the option is there.\n\n4) I was able to get Ubuntu 15.10 up and running after a lot of troubleshooting. The way to get it to work (as described by another user review here) is to start Ubuntu with the \"nomodeset\" command line option. Then update to the proprietary Nvidia drivers (\"sudo apt-get update\", then \"sudo apt-get install nvidia-352\"). Then make sure it is setup to use the proprietary Nvidia drivers (*NOT* the Nouveau drivers) by checking in Ubuntu's \"Additional Drivers\" utility. Do yourself a favor and use Ubuntu 15.10 for this, as it uses kernel 4.2, which avoids a problem where the wireless card on this computer not being recognized. Otherwise you have to update the kernel yourself, and I went through several hours of troubleshooting crashes/freezes before I ditched the latest LTS release for 15.10, which solved all my problems.\n\n5) I use this computer for work (on my Linux partition), and for fun/gaming (on the Windows partition). It plays even modern games quite well. Most of the time I play older games though (3-5 years old) and, as you'd expect, it plays those at max settings without even needing to turn on the fan.\n\n6) Speaking of the fans, this computer is very quiet. There is *zero* noticeable sound from the computer under most use. Only when I am running the most modern games do the fans get louder, or when I have it sitting on the bed and the ventilation is blocked. When the fans do turn on high, they are noticeable - but what else would you expect?\n\n7) The default setting of the touchpad is so sensitive that my palms passing near it while typing activates it. This is an easy fix however. In the bottom right, right-click the icon \"ELAN Pointing Device\" and select \"Property of Touch-Pad.\" On the new window that pops up, go to the \"ELAN\" tab, select the the Elan Smart-Pad device, and click Options. On the \"Additional\" tab in the new window, move the palm tracking sensitivity down to your preference (for me, this is one step above the minimum). Make sure that if you're doing all this with your touchpad, as opposed to an external mouse, that you don't turn it down so low that you can't use your touchpad anymore!"}

Gave it 5 stars because I think is unfair that most of the 1 star reviews are because people simply don't read these reviews to learn that you need to update the drivers to fix all  the issues. Here I give specific instructions.\n\nPros\n-Great Value for Price. Best you will find probably.\n  -Intel i5-6300HQ quad core 2.3 GHz is the best feature of this laptop together with the GTX 960. (SImply better than the ASUS specs)\n-You can open it ridiculously easy with just one screw in your way.\n-Expandable RAM memory up to 16 GB\n-Expandable SSD drive\n-Very quiet\n-Performs amazing against the toughest engineering softwares I have\n-I used 3DMarks and PCMarks and it  compared at least 3 times better than the Asus and better than some gaming laptops.\n-The two fans keep the laptop very cool except for one spot over the f8 but you don't really feel it.\n-The screen color and definition is great! Specially in comparison with the ASUS\n\nCons\n-IT  REQUIRES TO DOWNLOAD ALL THE DRIVERS UPDATE FROM THE DELL WEBSITE (I put instructions below)\n-Material is plastic so it feels a bit cheap in comparison with the ASUS K501UX\n-Heavier than the ASUS K501\n-It requires a bit more work to keep it clean from the oily  finger prints\n-It has this annoying thing for me that the space bar sometimes puts two spaces instead of one. I still haven't figured it out yet why it does that\n-Bulky charger as expected\n-Screen had some bleed at first but after the drivers updates I don't see it anymore\n\nFor whom is in between this and the ASUS: If looks are more important to you and you don't mind that the trackpad is bulging a bit on the corner then go with the ASUS. If you care more for hardware and performance this is definitely your laptop. I had both and I have to say that the perfect computer for me would be this laptop with the aluminum built of the ASUS. But, otherwise, the ASUS had a lot more issues than this one to be honest. The trackpad on this one is a lot better. The screen and keyboard on this one is a lot more comfortable to me (except for the double space thing).\n\nInstructions for those people who don't feel like researching (-.-):\n\nGo to this link:\nhttp://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/19/product-support/ServiceTag/819NB62/drivers\n\nDownload all the drivers and then install them one by one and restart the laptop after each installation.\n\nTHAT'S IT!! THAT IS ALL YOU HAVE TO DO TO NO ISSUES WITH THE COMPUTER!"}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "I just returned mine today because windows installed an update while my computer was asleep and I kept getting a CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED blue screen that I couldn't recover from (even in safe mode). So I called windows and their only advice was make an appointment at your nearest windows store, so I did that and they told me it'll take about a week to get it back. Forget that. I've had it for 2 weeks, this shouldn't be happening. Also had issues with the wi-fi and graphics card drivers interfering with one another such that if I put my screen to sleep, I couldn't use my wi-fi adaptor. However, I updated the drivers and that was fixed for the short amount of time I had it until I got the aforementioned blue screen.\n\nAside from software, the TRACKPAD IS AWFUL. Couldn't even consider using this computer without having a place for a mouse which sucks because I still thought I was buying a laptop. Lastly, the screen isn't as great as you would have expected but good enough."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "I love this computer! I just bought a Dell Inspiron 15 #7547 several months ago and was never completely happy with it. This Dell i7559 Full HD is hands down, wonderful!!! This computer is fast, works wonderfully (despite the worries over Windows 10), and I am 100 percent blown away by the performance and graphics. I've played games for hours on this PC and have had no heating issues at all. Others have reported over heating, but I've not experienced it with this unit.\n\nI had the wifi drop off problem that many have complained about and while it was annoying before I knew what was causing it, once I read the previous reviews and realized it was a Windows problem, I went to Dell.com and downloaded the current drivers for this computer. I have had no wifi connection problems since I upgraded the system and it took only a few minutes to fix the problem.\n\nI installed my Sims 3 games and I can't believe how great the graphics are for such a hoggy game. On my last laptop much of the content was not shown due to the memory and graphics. On this computer, I can see the people drive in their cars through the town. Before, they got in the car and just arrived at their destination, now I can see everything on the game that I couldn't see before and it is very cool.\n\nMy last Dell had some kind of weird keyboard issues but this computer works flawlessly and I really recommend it. This computer is a little heavy and it's plastic where the casing on my other Dell is metal. I don't really like the plastic, but in this case, I cannot complain because the computer is awesome. I am so happy with this Dell compared with my past Dell purchases.\n\nOther people have commented that this has room for easy expansion-which is a huge plus as well. I did uninstall MacAfee which I don't like and installed my Norton for which I have a subscription-I had no trouble with this. The only trouble I've had is with Windows 10-seems it wasn't quite ready for Primetime, but in time the wifi glitches and browser problems will be addressed.\n\nFor laptop gaming, I find this computer perfect!! It's crisp, fast and has great graphics for a laptop-for the price, this laptop is really, really great!"}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "Quite a nice laptop.  I like the design with the matte black and the red.  Light-up keyboard is great and even though I prefer a separate mouse (i am using a wireless one) I found the track pad to work very well.  Images are crisp and clear, set-up was easy.  Speakers are fine, but again I tend to use separate ones.  This did not get hot at all after prolonged use which was great.  Overall a very solid laptop.  Miss having an optical drive, but that's a minor point."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "Amazing computer. It's fast, effective and comfortable to use. The image quality is a huge plus. No regrets in buying this laptop."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "5 days in and I really am liking this laptop. Excellent value for the money if you don't need fancy aluminum, carbon fiber or the latest super-thin tech. I don't mind the plastic and like the soft-touch areas. They will need some extra effort to keep clean though.\n\nBut there were certainly some issues out of the box!\n\nThe first thing I did was update all the drivers from the Dell Help & Support site. Since doing so, I have had absolutely no issues with the video drivers or the Wi-Fi so far.\n\nThe touchpad is a different story however. There seems to be a \"conflict\" between Windows 10 and the Elan driver/setup app and out of the box, the touchpad was virtually unusable. Why these manufacturers can't get this right on PC laptops is beyond me. It really seems to help keep MacBook sales strong :-)\n\nAnyway, the touchpad is working pretty well for me now. This is what I had to do:\n\nIt seems that the Windows 10 settings in All Settings / Devices / Mouse & Touchpad override the Elan settings from the ELAN tab in the Mouse control panel!\n\nFirst I updated the driver manually from this link:\n\nhttp://drivers.softpedia.com/get/KEYBOARD-and-MOUSE/Elantech/ELAN-PS-2-Port-Input-Device-Driver-15701-for-Windows-10-64-bit.shtml\n\nThis includes a full installer with what looks to be a much nicer control panel setup app, but running setup.exe does not seem to work. The control panel app is the same old default one. Well, the settings in there really don't work anyway so what I did was run the manual driver setup using dpinst.exe from the unzipped ELAN folder.\n\nOnce the new driver was installed, I used the settings in windows 10 from All Settings / Devices / Mouse & Touchpad to adjust to my liking.\n\nThe touchpad is working well for me now with smooth and precise pointer movement and two-finger scrolling.\n\nAs for the screen, it blows away the crappy, glossy lower-res TN panel on my 6-year old Dell Studio laptop this is replacing. It had a yellowish, warm cast out of the box but very good color once I calibrated it using my X-Rite i1Display with the i1Profiler software. It is bright enough for me and I really appreciate the matte surface.\n\nPerformance-wise I couldn't be happier. It boots to the desktop in under 20 seconds from cold off the included Sandisk SSD and the battery life is great when working/surfing (8 hours or so). I also added a WD 7200RPM 500GB hard drive to the empty 2.5\" bay for games/photo/video storage. Before that, the computer was pretty much perfectly silent during normal work. The fans only come on when there's some heavy CPU usage. Now there is just the faint sound of the WD drive in the background but I do kinda miss the complete silence :-).\n\nI have downloaded Steam and tried playing Project Cars (I like racing games primarily) and the graphics were smooth for the few minutes I have played so far. More than adequate for me.\n\nFor me, this is a keeper for sure! Saved me hundreds over anything else I could find with similar performance."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "More than ever, it is increasingly difficult for the average consumer to pick the differences between current laptop offerings without running all sorts of benchmark tests. With this laptop being marketed as a gaming laptop, despite still being suitable for all other computing tasks, it will likely only attract the interest of gamers or those looking for a performance laptop. Gamers looking at this product will likely completely understand the specs listed in the product listing, and not need further performance indicators to assess the laptop's suitability for their requirements.\n\nWithout running benchmark tests, I will keep my Dell XPS 15 9530 in mind for this review. That system's specs are Intel i7 4702hq 2.20ghz - 16gig  ram - Nvidia GeForce GT 750m video card - 3200 x 1800 touchscreen. One additional piece of background as it pertains to my review is that I worked for Dell for 18 years and am very familiar with their products.\n\nSummary - super fast laptop, nice aesthetics, not the highest quality of materials used - I  wouldn't say it feels cheap, but it feels nowhere as solid as my XPS.\n\nPros\nBoots up in a ridiculously short amount of time, and restores from suspend super fast\nLightening fast to use. As I am writing this review and alt tabbing between applications it is super fast. Granted, nothing I am using yet is putting any major strain on the system.\nExcellent cooling - with the laptop on my lap, the only temperature I can detect could only be classified as warm not hot.  My XPS gets a good deal warmer. Every once in a while, the fans come on and I can feel the warmer air being blown out the sides.\nIt has a network socket for a cat 5 cable (my XPS does not and requires a USB network adapter).\nSuper nice, quiet keyboard\nBacklit keyboard\n3 USB ports\n1 HDMI port\n1 SD socket\n1 headphone socket\n1 security lock provision\nSlot for a second standard or SSD drive to add to the existing SSD\nNice screen\n\nCons\nThe system loses WiFi functionality every time the system goes into suspend or after about an hour of use. I sit right next to my $299 Linksys WRT 1900 AC router that no other computer or mobile device (12 total) in my house has a problem with. When it fails, a red x appears over the WiFi logo in the system tray and when you mouse over it, it states \"Not Connected - No connections available.\" When you click on it, the Network Settings dialog appears with \"Not Available\" under the WiFi logo. All attempts to locate the WiFi network to re-connect were futile, and the only way to get back online was to reboot and the problem resurfaced again at the next suspend or idle time longer than 1 hour.\nThere is no battery level indicator to use to check battery level.\nThe lid lacks structural integrity - if you open from one corner, there will be a minor twist visible in the screen.\nThe keyboard area is not 100% solid and various areas of it dip slightly when I am typing.\nThe matte finish is nice but it gathers skin oil and fingerprints fairly rapidly, thus making it appear dirty after a few days use.\nNot a big fan of the keyboard being centered under the typing portion of the keyboard instead in the actual center of the product.\nNot a fan of the thick border around the screen.\nUPDATE - the Matt finish is absolutely terrible for hoarding oil from your skin or anything else from any other source - not a proud moment as an owner to walk into a meeting with palm prints on the lid...\n\nTHE BIGGIE - I'm not a gamer (anymore), but this laptop is supposed to be a gamer machine. While the standard computing tasks appeared to display the power and speed promised, I felt this review would be somewhat incomplete if I didn't at least play a game. Simply downloading a game demo is not as easy as it used to be back in the day when I played Medal of Honor. Once I logged into my son's Steam account, I got the demo for Dying Light.\n\nFrom the moment the demo was installed, the lag, just in the menu, was horrific and I thought this was likely to not be much better in actual game play. Unfortunately I was right  - the appearance of the game was bad in respect to how smooth the graphics were and the lag between mouse movements. It was unlike anything I have seen in many years. I think Medal of Honor was a lot smoother on my PC some 12 or so years ago. To give this a fair comparison, I then loaded the same game on my Alienware Alpha ASM100-4980 Console, which is roughly an $700 box. There, the game performed completely smoothly and the output was to a 46\" TV, far better than the laptop lag on its own 15\" LCD.\n\nI re-booted and I had the same experience - THEN\n\nI switched to a different game - TOXIKK\n\nCompletely different experience - lightening fast - no lag anywhere - everything was as one would expect - loved it - wish that was the first game I picked.\n\nI plugged in a network cable because I was tired of losing the network connection, only to discover that after about an hour, it lost that connection too! Removing and replacing the network cable does nothing to reestablish the connection. For whatever reason, this laptop does not want to remain online or on any network after about an hour. There is likely a fix for this (maybe), but it's pretty rotten to have a laptop ship in this condition,\n\nSometimes it doesn't lose the connection for a few hours - maybe there was a driver that needed updating and that happened in the background while I was finishing up this review.\n\nIn closing: I would have to say using this has not been a great experience. Other reviews also mentioned the loss of WiFi signal, but the biggest disappointment would have to be how it performed while playing a game. From that perspective, while there are many aspects of the system that I really I like, I would struggle to give this a very high recommendation as a gaming system because of my mixed results.\n\n12/3/2015 UPDATE - In the two weeks and two days since I reviewed the product, I have noticed a few more problems. These are both intermittent and not constant. All drivers are up to date and I have run diagnostics which yielded nothing.\n\n#1 The system will start to lag every 5-8 seconds as if its trying really hard to solve an impossible math problem - streaming video will pause while the audio continues, then the audio will continue pause and the video will 'fast forward' to catch up with the video.  While this is happening, the mouse will freeze on screen.\n\n#2 The system in coming back from sleep will have a Support Assist message telling me that \"The AC power adapter wattage and type cannot be determined. The battery may not charge. The system will adjust performance to match the power available. Please connect a Dell 130C AC adapter or greater for the best performance.\" This is the AC adapter that came with the product so either it or the laptop is failing.\n\n#3 While watching a 2 hour movie on Netflix using headphones (brand new Bose Quiet Comfort 25 noise cancelling) for Audio, a popup kept popping up telling me I had just plugged in headphones.  After about 15 seconds, the audio would return to the laptop speakers and shortly after again return to the headphones. Incredibly frustrating...\n\nYes, I could go to support and spend ages on the phone (and at some point I will) but for a system to have these issues straight out of the box I guess the dell of old (each product is tested before it is shipped) is truly gone for good.  There is no way this system was tested.\n\nWith the issues I am seeing, its almost like I have a prototype (I know I don't) but all is not well with this system - seems like it shipped early.\n\nSO ANNOYING... I have to keep re-starting the product - every few hours it goes into this mode of freezing every 20 seconds for about 3 seconds.  and the only solution is to re-start.  I love Dell products - just not this one."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "I waited a week to review this laptop, to be as informative as possible. Also as a disclosure, I will be asking for a refund or a new pc (maybe I got a lemon) shortly after writing this review. CONS:\n- First, when any of the laptop lags (even when a video has to pause for loading) the keypad and mouse courser stop functioning. This drives me crazy, causing me to shake the mouse courser wildly. It causes this beautiful pc to feel like it was made in 2002.\n-When any lag occurs while playing a video or audio the laptop does not pause load and buffer the audio. It plays the audio lagging the whole time. Choppy and annoying.\n-You most likely will NEED to use a mouse\n-Another con is that if the computer shuts or goes into sleep then hibernate the Ethernet port stops recognizing that the Ethernet cable is plugged in and requires a restart if you want your PC to pick up on any ethernet cable to plug in.\n-Ethernet cable is located on right side of computer near where I like to use my mouse. This can get in the way.\nThat about sums it up for the cons. However the first con about the computer freezing during any lagging is so annoying, I would only recommend this product if you are calm and collected and okay with your computer freezing while it loads anything.\n\nPROS: great hardware for the price.\n-Runs Dota 2 on maximum quality\n-good Wifi connection\n-Great eye appeal\n-reboots in no time."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "EDIT: The mouse issue can be easily resolved by upgrading your drivers on the dell.com website, or at least that worked for me.\nGo to dell.com, find drivers and downloads under the support section. Auto-detect your product and then a list of downloads should come up. I recommend that you set the list by importance and download and restart, download and restart. Yes, it is time consuming, but totally worth it to make your laptop work fine. I didn't have to download all of them either way, so you should be fine downloading the first five or so. Hope this helped to anyone facing this issue!\n\nArrived early afternoon, tried it and worked great... for the first few minutes at least.\n\nISSUE 1:Soon after I used it constantly had freezes time to time. It just stops moving your mouse and freezes your screen but then suddenly speeds up to get where you're supposed to be.\n\nMouse pad is okay, not too great but not horrible like some other reviews said. I will try to return and get a new one to see if this is just a unit issue, wonder if anyone else is having this freeze issue. In fact, this review probably took and extra five minutes because of the constant in-between freezes.\n\nISSUE 2:In addition, it has this strange bug where sometimes screen turns black and pops up after and saying this Intel Graphics issue.\n\nOver all it was a good computer and is if it didn't have this bugs, 5 stars for great performance, -1 for freezes, -1 for graphics issue. Hopefully it may stop the constant freezes after a while and then it would be a great computer. Until then, I'll see what happens and return if it continues."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "\"Based on extensive use over 1 weekend. Will update if any problems happen further along.\"\n\nGreat laptop, loads everything quickly and runs buttery smooth. Had to download drivers (video, bios, wifi, etc.) to get everything right but didn't take more than an hour to have everything good.\n\nPros:\n~ Quick as a bunny. the M.2 256GB SSD is amazing at this price and there is an empty slot for a 2.5\" SATA HDD/SSD drive. Just pop the back cover and plug it a 2.5\" in. The screw for the back cover might need a little elbow grease to get off though.\n~ 8GB ram is only 1 slot so its easy to add another if you feel like you need 16.\n~ Gaming is great so far. Running above 30fps on 1080p with a mix of high to medium settings in the Witcher 3. If you aren't familiar with it, the Witcher 3 is a 2015 game with high demands if you want to run it on high or ultra settings. You won't run 4k or Maxed out settings on this laptop but honestly, no laptop within this price range can. (quick testing, GTAV: 1080p high settings at 44fps, MGSV: 1080p ultra at 35 fps, COD: BO3: ultra 1080p 30fps, Fallout 4: ultra 1080p 26 fps)\n~ Best bang for your buck. At 800$, I doubt you'll find another laptop with these specs. At least not at this moment (November 2015).\n~ Rubberish coat on the laptop feels very nice. However, I've had this same feeling on other rubber coatings and those materials often get chipped with scratch marks on it. I am somewhat expecting to see marks on the topside of the laptop sooner or later but have not seen any so far.\n~ Aesthetically pleasing. From the front, the laptop is subtle with some red to catch your eye but the backside and side vents give this laptop a more gamer feel. The speakers look nice with red underneath as well.\n\nCons:\n~ Update those drivers ASAP. Some people haven't had problems but you would be a fool not to update just in case. I wish they would have shipped this out without the issues\n~ Display is not amazing. The colors are a bit drab and it overall feels just ok. Also, when I start it up I see a dead pixel. It disappears when I get to my home screen but I'm not completely sure if this isn't going to be an issue later on.\n~ Gaming problems. Before I updated my drivers, my games had an issue recognizing the gtx 960m and instead ran on the integrated gpu. This meant the games were unplayably slow. 1 hour after updates and restarts, the games ran fine but I was quite worried for a moment.\n~ Hefty. This may not be a con to some people because it does make it seem a bit more sturdy but don't expect this laptop to be lightweight.\n~ Oil marks. Don't have pizza and type on this keyboard, although you really shouldn't do that with any keyboard. This keyboard seems to collect oil very easily but can be cleaned with little trouble. Not too big of a deal so far.\n~ Get a mouse. Yes the trackpad is usable but any extended time clicking and dragging and your wrist will hate you. Not the worst trackpad I've ever used but not that much better.\n~ Don't expect amazing speakers. This isn't a big con to me at all because I don't expect very loud and clear speakers from a laptop but just in case this matters to you, don't expect to have a party with these speakers.\n\nOverall I am very pleased with the laptop. My main concerns were that the laptop be speedy to handle professional work well, handle skype smoothly and clearly, and be able to play new games well. This laptop fulfills all of that at a very reasonable price."}

It is going to be difficult to keep this device out of the hands of my teen-ager -- I think he may be in love with it already. It could use another hard drive for storage and if you look at the features it does have bluetooth 4 and USB 3 but it does not have a DVD or CD drive, so you will either have to get an external drive or stick with downloaded applications and games. With this hardware and Win 10, they kind of do want you to go to doing more with cloud services. Again, an excellent device - very sturdy - full size keyboard and display. The device I tested does not have a touch screen."}

I've not needed to download any new drivers, etc. Maybe there was a bad batch that shipped out first.\n\nI like Dell. I currently have a year-old Dell desktop that I was using for PlayOn----this new Dell is the first laptop I've owned that was robust enough to act as the \"server\"...others weren't.\n\nThings I love:\n>> The matte screen is beautiful, the sharpest screen I've ever seen\n>> Fast start-up, fast multi-tasking, the regular speakers sound great for a laptop\n>> Back-lit keyboard - yeah! Looks like LED lighting but I'm not positive\n>> Full-size numerical keyboard\n>> Well-built, even though plastic, I love the rubbery finish and the red logo\n>> Excellent battery life, 6-7 hours for me but I was using Word, emailing, surfing; 10% of the time gaming\n\nThings I don't particularly care for:\n>> The touch pad, at least it has a L/R clickable area though (I prefer to use a wireless mouse anyway)\n>> No CD/DVD drive, you can plug in an external drive if you need one\n>> I don't know why they bothered including a sub-woofer, it doesn't sound all that great\n\nI'm not much of a gamer, the extent of my game collection is Wolfenstein and The Walking Dead. If you aren't a gamer either, don't let gaming laptop in the description scare you away. You're getting better graphics, better-sounding speakers, and a robust processor to do whatever else on other than gaming. (BTW, the 2 games I *do* have look extraordinary when played on this Dell)."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "This laptop is such a steal at $800. You are getting a significant amount of pc hardware that easily can cost upwards of $1k.\n\nPros:\n+INSANELY quiet when not doing intensive tasks such as web browsing and watching video.\n+Amazing graphics card with 4GB of VRAM that can handle a ton of new games. Games I frequently play and get at least 60fps at max settings: League of Legends, CSGO. Fallout 4 runs at 60fps on medium settings but it still looks good.\n+Great IPS 1080p anti-glare screen. (Put my brightness to around 30% and it's still bright)\n+The keyboard is perfect and the backlight is comfortable even in the dark.\n+Start-up time is around 6 seconds. (+/- password input time)\n+Acceptably thin for a gaming laptop but a tad bit heavy.\n+Great speakers for listening to audio without headphones.\n+The battery is honestly the best I've ever seen. I did a project that involved researching videos which took me over 10 hours and I still was left with around 60-70% left.\n+Expandability for more storage in the future with either the option for another SSD or an HDD.\n\nCons (Don't let the long text scare you):\n-Personally I don't fancy the matte finish all around the laptop because you can see smudges when you rest your palm or when you are carrying it somewhere. Thankfully if you haven't dipped your fingers into a bag of Doritos then you should be able to wipe the smudges clean with a shirt.\n-The trackpad is defiantly not a 10/10. I had the misfortune of receiving my laptop with a slightly sagging trackpad. If I just lightly tap on the two bottom corners of the laptop, the trackpad itself sinks a bit. I'd rather not RMA the laptop anyway since it would just be too much of a hassle and the computer is honestly just too good to send in for a new one. It's really not the end of the world since I can just get a mouse (which you should be using as well anyway) to replace using the trackpad. But hey, if you are on the go, I'd rate it a 7/10 and it performs how a trackpad should.\n-Bulky-ish charger.\n\nThoughts:\nTo those that are complaining about backlight bleed at the bottom, I have it too. Honestly, it's not a big deal. Even when you're watching a video/movie, generally you tend to look at the actual video/movie and not the backlight bleed. It's not even noticeable unless you squint your eyes and look closely.\nThe fans overall cooling start to kick in once you start doing intensive tasks like gaming or when the system just generates a little heat. I did notice however it gets sort of warm at the very top of the keyboard below the Dell logo but I can understand because heat pipes run directly under that area. Most of the time my hands are on the keyboard anyway so it's really no big deal.\n\nBeing a college student, I picked this up for myself because I have to do on-the-go CAD design and this looked like the perfect laptop. I was so pleased with this laptop and I would totally recommend this to anyone out there looking for a gaming/productivity laptop. It's certainly a top tier contender among other $1k priced laptops."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "I just got one of these directly from Dell for a client and it's been really good so far. It's fast and has worked flawlessly. It does have some pros and  cons.\n\nPros:\n-pretty cheap for all you get!\n-fast, fast video, fast gaming--you get a lot for what you pay for!\n-second hard drive slot. You can add a second hard drive for more storage (but that will eat at battery life if you play unplugged). Mine had the cable and bracket sitting inside, but I hear from others that some don't have the bracket and cable included (be careful when looking online because last year's inspiron 7000 series bracket is different).\n-nice 1080p IPS screen--a little backlight bleed when screen is on and black but that's expected for ips. IPS means better viewing angles and colors but it also means a bit of blacklight bleed on very dark scenes.\n-I like the keyboard and the backlight.\n-feels well built and durable.\n-the 8GB of memory is a single chip so you can add another 8GB of memory easily!\n\nCons:\n-touchpad is bawls. You can press down and it clicks, but there are no separate physical buttons for left and right click. If you turn off all the gestures and crap it works ok, but it's not great. We use an external mouse anyway, but still, it's not the best.\n-it's pretty big. It has to be to get all the processor and graphical power it has, but don't expect and ultralight.\n-battery is not user replaceable. You have to unscrew the bottom cover to get to it. You can replace it when it dies without too much trouble if you're techy, but you can't bring an extra battery with you to get a longer life!\n-warranty is only one year and is a mail-in warranty (Dell pays shipping both ways). If you want a longer warranty or in-home service, order the laptop directly from Dell. You can raise the warranty to 3 years and get Dell to send a tech to your house for warranty repairs for $120. They also offer accidental damage warranties when you order directly from Dell (Dell's accidental damage warranty terms are the best). But at the moment the price on Amazon is much better than the price on Dell.\n\nEverything else:\n-it looks fine, but there's nothing special about it. The design is boring, but that does mean it can be both a gaming laptop and a business laptop. Some gaming laptops pile on the schtick, but this one piles on the unassuming... It's up to you if that's good or bad.\n\nIn the end, we love it. It's fast, cheap, and runs great! I would definitely buy it again, and will probably buy others for other clients."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "I have upgraded my long overdue MSI GT683 with Nvidia GTX560M. To get to the point about performance, I have no issues running at high settings with the latest titles, The Witcher 3, Shadow Of Mordor etc. If you are talking about 4K resolution at high settings you should not even consider the bargin you are presently getting from Dell. Look for the Nvidia 980M or higher for a quality experience across the board at those resolutions. Others have brought up issues with WIFI connectivity that randomly disconnects after about 20min. in some cases. I have had this laptop only 3 days now and my adapter is still working without a problem. This PC is actually half the size of my MSI and performance is what you would expect from the specs listed.\nThere is also a very small delay on the trackpad before the cursor starts to move which others did not appreciate. I do not find this an annoyance in any way for me. The trackpad is multi touch and integrates with the operating system nicely. There is also a setting for cursor delay in windows which was brought to my attention while reading about the problem prior to purchasing. I use an external mouse at home and like I've said, it's not a problem for me. I have also ordered another 8gb of memory to give it a total of 16. I've also installed a 1TB drive in the extra slot for my media.\nThe matte screen is is perfect for gaming. It's quiet and the battery life is great. There is only one screw at the bottom and the everything that you need access to is right there. The craftsmanship on this unit is wonderful, everything is put together soo neatly and is really asthetically pleasing. Dell really has their house in order in that respect! Great value and quality, Thank You Dell!!!"}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "Nice larger screen. Comparable in performance to the Acer Aspire E5-573G which I also have and have written a review of. The aspect ratio of this screen is closer to 16:9 (this screen is about the same width, but shorter than the screen on the Aspire E5. Overall I found this screen to be sharper, but at the same time not as smooth. The keyboard here is less than a full size keyboard in size, but does have a numeric keypad (very helpful for gaming). Even with the huge real-estate of the size of this laptop (if you have a huge lap) -- let's call it \"portable\", the keyboard manages to be a circa 1980's style keyboard which i don't like. I have laptops that are literally 1/4 the size (much smaller) which have WAY more comfortable keyboards. Travel is fine, but the feel is just off. Part of it seems to be the huge gaping spaces between the keys. It is pretty easy for me to adjust keyboards (I use many different computer during the day), but not so here.\n\nOn performance, I found the W10 performance to be reliable and fast (didn't crash). I'd say it was similar in CPU performance to any other i5 (I have four other i5s). Boot time was fast, but not nearly as fast as my Surface Pro 3. That said it was faster than the Acer Aspire E and a comparably equipped Lenovo Thinkpad (all of which are i5 with SSDs). So this came in #2 boot time.\n\nIn terms of sound, I prefer the sound (less echo ?) on the Dell vs. the Acer. Overall the Dell is a bit smaller with less space from the front back to the keyboard and a shorter screen. WiFi performance was solid with AC, N, and G routers that I tested with. I did have to upgrade NVIDIA Gforce driver immediately (11/9/15 was new driver release date). That took a while, but went smoothly.\n\nAnother oddity besides the keyboard is that the trackpad is off center. The trackpad is actually in the center of the keyboard (where it should be), but because this laptop has a numeric keypad, this places the trackpad off center on the laptop. The location is correct and comfortable when typing and then switching to the trackpad, but it takes a bit of getting used to if you are switching from another task to trackpad.\n\nAt the time I got the Acer the price was higher -- and prices are always changing, but currently the Acer is lower cost."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "<div id=\"video-block-R22M3DYHPACU91\" class=\"a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block\"></div><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"\" value=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/D12KwGncL7S.mp4\" class=\"video-url\"><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"\" value=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/01huQF6pkOS.png\" class=\"video-slate-img-url\">&nbsp;For a laptop computer, any laptop made by any brand, to cost almost $1000 at the end of 2015 it better be one of the best computers on the planet. PC laptops have generally fallen to the $200-300 range for a good one from a brand name.  If you read the news reports it has been said that laptops are already dead along with their desktop brothers  replaced by smartphones and tablets, and there is already talk that tablet sales have peaked and are on a downward spiral.\n\nSo what makes this laptop from Dell worth anywhere near its champagne & caviar selling price? Quality of construction? Is it crafted from an exotic ultra-lightweight metal?  Nope, its just ordinary plastic. How about power?  Well, it takes a techies eye to recognize it as at first glance any computer with only an Intel i5 chip, 8GB RAM and a 256GB hard drive sounds downright puny in todays competitive world.  (More on this later).\n\nHow about the screen image quality and graphics?  Well, now were on to something. No it doesnt have a 17 screen, but for me, that size is massive overkill in a portable computer.  No matter how you slice it the 15 screen was, is and will be the sweet size that strikes the perfect balance between viewability and portability.\n\nWhile not a large screen, especially for a gaming machine, the screen and graphics card verge on being close to the best you can get in a PC laptop.  The GeFocce GTX 960M (4GB GDDR5) graphics card will cut through most games like butter at high settings and 1080p and receive 30 frames per second.  Yes, this is a gaming machine.\n\nThe keyboard is the familiar chiclets-style that is found on almost every laptop computer made these days. It is not bad nor is it great. A saving grace is that it is nicely illuminated, although it doesnt light up like Vegas like on a fancy gaming keyboard. The keyboard also has a full numeric keypad, something business users will love. It also has a HUGE trackpad with clickable left and right mouse buttons. I've heard some people don't like it being centered below the text keys rather than centered on the machine but I almost never use trackpads anyway. I prefer a mouse because I tend to do a lot of scrolling, plus I like extra programmable buttons.\n\nNot having an optical drive (i.e. CD/DVD) is something lacking on a unit as expensive as this is, although it certainly is no longer a necessity anymore.  The battery pack is more capable yet smaller and lighter than most laptops were only a few years ago, which is a plus, but WHY do laptops still require a charging pack as large and heavy as this one?  There is no lack of connectivity, with all three of the USB ports being 3.0 capable (backward compatible).  DisplayPort is not present which might tweak some hardcore gamers. And a subtle but appreciated touch is that there is a lower bay door that opens easily to snap in up to 8GB more RAM or another larger hard drive. I should note that when I say hard drive Im using the term interchangeably with the 256GB SSD (solid-state drive) that actually comes preinstalled in the computer. SSDs offer faster boot times, quieter/cooler operation, better battery life, faster data access and less chance to be damaged by sudden jolts to the unit.\n\nI was initially disappointed to find the CPU being only an Intel i5, being under the belief that the i7 was a more powerful chip. Generally that may be true in the classic sense of power but this chip is no slouch. It uses the newest 6th Generation Skylake architecture based processors that were just introduced a few weeks ago in late 2015. Specifically it is an Intel Core i5-6300HQ. The processor contains four cores, a 2.3GHz clock speed and up to 3.2GHz turbo boost mode. It benchmarks a similar performance to processors such as the i7-4712HQ which gets around 7500 CPU Mark points which is excellent. The i5-6300HQ performs about the same but in a cooler and more power-efficient package. In other words, this processor is absolute top drawer in performance.\n\nIn todays world of cloud computing the 256GB storage drive isn't as small as it sounds.  I found it adequate for my needs. But it is comforting to know that it would only take seconds to snap a larger storage drive into place. Ditto with the RAM which is 8GB DDR3L 1600MHz. I am used to a little more and 8GB is borderline for me, but RAM is cheap and that is one of the first improvements I will be making.\n\nInternet connectivity is 802.11 A/C  plus a Bluetooth 4.0 adapter. Theres also an  integrated 1000Mbps controller with RJ-45 port in case you want to connect using hard-wire.  I like that it has a built-in SD card slot, something I will use often but my happy face went away when I saw it lacked a touch screen, something that seems like it should be standard equipment now that Windows 10 has figured out how to give us the best of traditional keyboard AND touchscreen interactivity.  For the price I for one will miss it.\n\nWhile Im not an IT person, I have a lot of experience with computers  desktop, laptop and tablet.  Somehow Ive been able to make it through my adult life never owning a Dell product. Thats not a reflection on Dell, but honestly Ive never even considered one  my opportunities always lead me to purchase brands like HP, IBM/Lenovo, ASUS and a few others.  So if you're like me and have never owned a Dell you may be interested in my overall gut first impression and overall satisfaction with this one, knowing that it certainly represents one of their most expensive laptop products.\n\nUnlike some of the hard-core gaming laptops, this one is not a beast  in design or handling. It is, in fact, quite svelte in its slim profile and lack of garish trim that is often associated with gaming laptops.\n\nSUMMARY:\n\nWe have many choices these days and so far, nothing has come along that can do everything.  Our smartphones are incredible but no matter how big a smartphones screen is it just doesnt cut it for serious gaming, graphics work or everyday business work.  Tablets do so much today they can almost replace a traditional computer but if you add on a keyboard and mouse (if possible) and USB hub, etc. you're carrying around pretty much the weight and volume of a laptop.  There are ultra-slim laptops that are gorgeous (and expensive) and there are cheap Chromebooks that lack full compatibility with the entire range of games and business software.  So, yes, there is still a need for an authentic genuine laptop like this one and if you are performance hungry and not used to compromise this one actually begins to not look so expensive after all.  True, its not super-lightweight. True its kind of a monster to carry around. True even with its advanced battery it still won't get you through an entire day without a recharge.  Those are the trade-offs for blazing speed and an image quality that will knock your socks off.  If you are in the market for a business machine this one has your number. If you are a gamer on a budget who is looking for the best you can afford, Dell knows who you are.  For what it is, and how it does what it is intended to do, I believe Dell has a winner and my out-of-the-gate rating is 5-stars.  Lets see how it survives real-life everyday use for a few months and Ill report back as necessary."}

There are gaps around the keys which plays into what you would\nexpect at this price point but includes a cool back lighting effect.

There are 3 USB ports an HDMI port, a card reader, and an Ethernet port. The touchpad works well and is a little larger than usual. The onboard wifi Bluetooth adapter prodived AC wifi speeds and Bluetooth 4.0 connectivity.\n\nThe built in speakers, lined up as a stylish bar in front of the lid hinge, are surprisingly good quality with a subwoofer inbuilt on the underside. There was some distortion when running at 100% but overall while playing music the speakers sounded quite rich.\n\nUninstall McAfee bloatware after you start the machine and then proceed with enjoying a fine quality laptop from Dell."}

This is most likely the cheapest gaming laptop on the market right now, but lets talk about what it is good and what is bad about this PC. You can either read on or watch my YouTube video.\n\nPros:\nThe GTX 960M is no 4K gaming GPU but it will play all the latest games without issue. 4Gb's of Video Ram gives you a lot more versatility though this would matter more at 4K. The i5 6300HQ CPU is very snappy and responsive, while it wouldn't be good for editing it will handle everything you can throw at it. A 256Gb SSD, wow when do you get 256gb's on any model PC without it being over 1K. Having the SSD makes the expereince better all around. The design is very appealing and definitely is an eye catcher but at the same time it is not flamboyant. The cooling system works very well and will make sure you never over heat, usually a laptop with a discrete GPU will overheat a lot.\n\nPros Recap:\n-Powerful Discrete Graphics Card\n-High performance i5 CPU\n-A spacious CPU\n-The Design\n-Cooling System\n\nCons:\nThe keyboard feels very cheap and there is not much for back-light customization either. The touch-pad is not very responsive and it also misses some clicks. The display is IPS but the color accuracy and saturation are quite off and it looks just a bit washed. Though it will do just fine for gaming if you are ok with 60Hz. Driver issues have been a cause for some concern, lots of WiFi dropping in and out though this can be fixed. Also with all this performance it is quite heavy. Lastly is Audio- Very cheap quality audio and the subwoofer might as well just be removed, it simply serves its purpose but no where close to professional level, the dell audio software tweaks make it sound a bit better but it does cause some pops and distortion sometimes.\n\nCons:\n-Cheap Keyboard\n-Terrible Touch-Pad\n-IPS Panel is quite ugly for Color Accuracy\n-Driver issues/Wifi Drop\n-Bad Audio"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "I wasn't really looking for a pure gaming laptop but did want something better than the usual low spec, under performing laptops out there.  I think I found exactly the perfect laptop.  It has terrific hardware and is built well.  It runs Windows 10 and everything I've thrown at it smoothly and quickly.  The screen is excellent although not perfect.  The trackpad on mine works just fine although some people have complained about it.  I use a mouse 99% of the time anyways.  The keyboard is sensitive and took some getting used to but it does the job.  As for games, it plays them very well and even though I'm into mostly older games I'm able to run them with MAX settings and this laptop runs them perfectly.  There are 3 USB ports and and SD card reader.  The chassis is reasonably thin and the overall weight is not that bad for such a strong performer.  I haven't run it on battery much yet but I suppose it will be average for a laptop like this.  I also love how upgrading will be simple with such easy access to the innards of the laptop.  I'll add ram and an extra SSD very soon since they aren't expensive.  Not much else to say....this is a great buy and IMO it's a better value than similar laptops from MSI and various other mfgers.  The Dell gives you hardware that compares with laptops costing $1100 bucks or more for $800.  There is no optical drive but I added a Dell unit for about $35 bucks through Amazon which will do the trick.  Highly recommended.  Unless you are a hardcore, all day gamer that needs insane hardware, this laptop will meet or exceed your expectations."}

It has been seen on many other new laptops and upgrades from Win 7 and 8.\nYou can google Microsoft and find the forum that reviews this problem.  MS posted two useless notes and no definite fix was found.\nI ran into the Dell site looking for drivers.\nThis was helpful.\nDownload a small program from Dell that looks at what new drivers and BIOS are available for your machine.\nRun the program and a list of recommended upgrades is listed.\nCheck all (maybe 10 or so on my machine) and download.  Hopefully your machine will stay connected long enough for this to complete.\nThen 1 by 1 add the upgrades.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "This is an evolving review. (11/6).\n\nOut of the box, this thing is fantastic. It's not TOO heavy, the matte black with accents really looks nice and feels good. Typing is fine on this.\nI installed a second 250GB SSD, and have an extra stick of RAM coming, for a total of ~$125, which is too good to pass up.\n\nRunning Witcher 3...At highest settings, it is still a bit slow and choppy. That wasn't too important, but at low/med it is flying. To me, I'd rather it be smooth than to see each blade of grass. The fans are pretty quiet...and the laptop did not get hot at all. Good stuff.\n\nRemoving the bloatware: There isn't much, but I get confused with the Dell support stuff and Windows 10. I didn't do a 'clean install', not sure how or if I need to. I updated Wifi, Nvidia and Intel drivers. I don't have too many issues with the trackpad. Seems ok for me, but I use a mouse 90% of the time.\n\nI am getting an issue when I put this in sleep/hibernation, then wake up. CPU idles at 50% up to 100%...and system freezes / lags / chokes about a second or two every 10 seconds. I'm not sure what is going on, but it is probably some process I have yet to identify. Restart solves the problem. I need to play around with this a bit more as I just got it yesterday, but so far - it's good. I just have some problem adjusting to Windows 10 right now.\n\nUPDATE: This machine is great. I installed two more updates (below in comments) that other users said helped with sleep. But I recommend not using sleep at all. Change your power button to ShutDown. This machine takes 10 seconds to boot up, there is no point to put it into Sleep mode.  Seeing a bit of screen bleed when the machine is booting up, but can't tell even when I'm looking at a rendered black screen. So far, really happy with purchase...though, not sure I like Windows 10!  Playing Witcher 3 is really smooth and nice at Medium settings, and I could probably go higher.\n\nThe sounds is pretty crappy, but that is true of most laptops. I bumped it up a star, to 5 - because even with lackluster sound, some updating, and a less then precise trackpad....this is an awesome machine, and you can't beat the price."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "Update: 12/7/2015\n\nBad -  Have had this laptop for 32 days and today received an CRC error when trying to copy files off the C: drive. Had to run CHKDSK to deal with bad sector.\n\nGood - since I bought this in October 2015, I expected the warranty to expire in October 2016. Logged in to support and warranty is through January 2017. That is already better than I ever got from ASUS.\n\nUpdate 12/3/2015\n\nDell has done the right thing and rolled out an update to its software that automatically remove the self-signed root certificate. If you buy this laptop, make absolutely certain the root certificate is removed before doing any serious work with it.\n\nIMO, this issue was the only thing keeping this from a 5 star rating based on the price.\n\nUpdate: 11/26/2015\n\nChanged my rating to 3-star. From a hardware perspective, this is a great bargain at the price that lets me play most of the games I want at decent FPS/graphics settings.\n\nHOWEVER, don't buy this if you are not technically astute enough to track down Dell's root cert removal tool and run as soon as you unpack it. This is a serious security hole Dell has punched into the OS, and should not be taken lightly. That Dell thought this was a good idea, especially after the Superfish debacle that Lenovo just went through, suggests that whoever is responsible for things like this at Dell has extremely questionable judgment and does not bode well for the possibility that there are other security problems Dell has introduced.\n\nUpdate: 11/24/2015\n\nThis is one of its laptops that Dell elected to install a self-signed root cert. Downgraded my rating to one-star. Not recommended.\n\nFor more info: http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/11/dell-apologizes-for-https-certificate-fiasco-provides-removal-tool/\n\n-------------------\n\nIf you'd told me a couple years ago that I'd be singing the praises of a Dell gaming laptop, I'd have laughed you out of my office. But I'd be shocked if there is a better $800 laptop that packs everything this has to offer.\n\nPositives\n\n1. The 960M is obviously not the fastest mobile graphics around, but it achieved acceptable (50-60 FPS) framerates in pretty much every game I threw at it. Yes, you'll have to dial down the graphic settings in some games, but you'll get a playable experience from pretty much any game you can buy today.\n\n2. The Dell does a good job of keeping heat under control. I installed 100+ Steam games and spent several hours playing/benchmarking various games. According to Open Hardware Monitor, the hottest the GPU ever got was 67 celsius.\n\n3. With the SSD, this boots into Windows very quickly (I have a Lenovo ultrabook that takes twice as long as the Dell to boot to desktop). Of course, it is booting into the privacy nightmare that is Windows 10, but you could also install Ubuntu or one of the Ubuntu variants instead.\n\n4. The ability to expand storage/RAM without voiding the warranty is very much appreciated. I ordered a Crucial 250gb SSD and an 8gb RAM stick with the laptop and installed those immediately. The laptop recognized both immediately on boot and I was on my way.\n\n5. One of the things I can't emphasize enough is that when you remove the bottom plate on the laptop, it reveals pretty much all of the interior. This is crucial from my experience as I have had several laptops where it is almost impossible to effectively clean dust out of them because there are areas that are almost impossible to access for cleaning. That will not be a problem at all on this laptop.\n\n5. Three USB 3.0 ports and an SD card reader. This shouldn't be a point of pride, but so many laptops that cost twice as much as this ship with fewer USB ports and no SD card readers. Thank you, Dell.\n\n6. Matte screen. When every manufacturer seems to be going for eyestrain-inducing glossy screens, it is nice to have a usable matte screen.\n\nNegatives\n\n1. Screen bleed. I almost never notice this sort of thing, but it was apparent from the very first boot that there was significant screen bleed on the lower part of the laptop. Honestly, this doesn't bother me, but if you are the sort of person whom this would drive crazy, you might have to do a few returns or send to Dell to resolve this issue.\n\n2. The function keys default to carrying out multimedia functions. So when I hit F5 to refresh my browser, instead Spotify starts playing. Stupid, stupid, stupid. You have to boot into the BIOS and change the function key settings to fix this, but you shouldn't have to.\n\n3. I'd say the trackpad sucks, but I hate trackpads in general. There's a number pad on the machine, so the trackpad is offset  to the left which just looks goofy aesthetically.\n\nThe keyboard itself is usable, but barely. It appears they made the keys relatively small in order to have a larger trackpad. What Dell should have done is ditch the number pad, shrink the trackpad a bit and increase the size of the keys. I can hit 100wpm on my Lenovo, but I'd be surprised if I could get 60wpm on this.\n\nI was getting ready to purchase a $1200 gaming laptop this week before happening across this, and am very glad I did. Amazing that Dell, of all companies, delivers such a high quality/low price gaming laptop."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "I had my eye on this laptop for a few weeks before it came out.  I've had it for about a week now; so this is more of a first impressions type review.\n\nThis is a very good value for your money.  It is advertised as a gaming laptop, and while it doesn't match the high end features of my previous laptop (Qosmio), it makes up for them in other ways.\n\nPros:\n\n-Nice size/weight.\n-Great \"bang for yer buck\"\n-No bloatware (accept McAffe)\n-6th gen quad core i5\n***it can be difficult to know just what you are getting due to intel's pathetic CPU naming scheme.  This particular i5 is very similar to a standard i7.  Pretty much, the only difference is that you don't get hyperthreading with this CPU.  It really depends on what kind of software you are running if this matters much.  Lots of games depend more on the GPU, and maybe aren't even multi-threaded.  You will only see a performance hit on multi-threaded software.***\n\n-decent video card (Nvidia 960 with 4GB)\n-switch between Intel and Nvidia gfx\n***you can choose (per application) which video card to use.  Intel for light-duty (saves a good deal of battery)  Nvidia for heavy-duty.  See the pictures below.  You right-click on the desktop and select \"NVidia Control Panel.\"  Then per-application, you can choose if which card that you want to use.  In this case, I want to use the NVidia card for Unity 3D.  So, I select it from the dropdown, and make sure to hit \"apply.\"  If you don't see your application, you can add it to the list by pressing the \"Add\" button.***\n\n-8GB system memory on one stick\n***this could be a pro or a con, if you plan to upgrade to 16 GB, you can find a matching 8GB and you don't have to \"re-buy\" ram you already have.  OTOH, you don't get dual channel memory as you would with a 4x2 configuration***\n\n-open hard drive bay\n\nCONS:\n\n-The screen is not nearly as pretty as the ads from Dell would have you believe.  The luminous glory of the screen on my Qosmio  would have made this screen impossible to see if you put them side by side (just kidding).  Even my phone's screen is MUCH NICER (Note 4).  Also, some other people pointed out that the color gamut is highly inaccurate, and there is some screen bleed around the edges in low-light situations and black screens.  Honestly, it's not the worst but it's not the greatest either.\n\nIf you buy the laptop on Dell's website, you can get a 4k touchscreen.  no idea what that is like... prolly slaughters the GPU, though...\n\n-The subwoofer is a COMPLETE JOKE.  It has a 1 inch diameter.  you can barely even tell it is there.  I'm not even sure why they bothered.  There is an included \"DELL Audio\" app which allows you to add compression and equallization to your system sound.  It  succeeds is making the laptop sound MUCH LOUDER (it is on by default), but at the expense of adding some noticeable distortion when playing certain audio programs.  (Final Fantasy 13-2 is a noticeable offender).  I use headphones, often, so that helps... some\n\n-The headphone jack... has problems.  it definitely sounds muddy through decent headphones (Sennhieser HD280).  Also, it doubles as a mic input, so you have to choose what you just inserted from a pop-up menu, and you have to have a special adapter to use a separate mic.  You definitely won't be doing any high-quality recording with this input (it is relegated to 16 bit/48khz).  Of course, you wouldn't expect that from a laptop anyway.  if you need good sound, you should think about an external solution.\n\n-The overall port scene is somewhat lacking.  There are 3 USB ports (all 3.0), an HDMI port, the aforementioned headphone/mic port, ethernet, a card reader...  that's it.  I would like to see a VGA or a displayport (or 2 HDMI, at least) and more USB ports (at least one more)  oh well, get what ya pay for in this instance."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "Really loving this laptop so far. The build quality feels sturdy and well-made. The red and black colors look good and are actually darker than in the pictures listed above so it looks even better in person. The screen is the highlight of this machine for me. After going into the Intel graphics and setting the saturation to the highest setting the color is bright and vivid. The screen does not get as bright as other laptops but it's more than enough for me. Besides being IPS the screen also has an anti-glare covering which really helps a lot with reflections and the viewing angles are excellent (no weird color changes or anything like that when viewing from the side or top). There is a bit of bleeding in the lower screen as others have stated but that is only when the screen is black at the bottoms which is usually never so it's not really even noticeable. The keypad also feels sturdy and the click of the keys is a pleasing sound to anyone who types a lot. I have been running games that don't require too much energy (i.e. Baldur's Gate II) with the settings on the highest and the laptop on regular balanced mode and everything runs perfectly. Can't wait to try more games on this! The color is so good it really brings the games, movies, and pictures alive. The only issue, as others have already stated, is the trackpad is not the best, it being unresponsive at times and having to slide my finger over it several times to get the pointer where I need it to be, but I prefer using a wireless mouse anyway so for me it's not too much of a problem at all. With all of the other great qualities about this machine, not to mention its amazing price point, it is well worth the money and definitely worth purchasing."}

It's loose by much less than 1mm, but when you tap it, you feel it. This makes right click frustrating. Also the trackpad isn't sensitive enough, even setting sensitivity to maximum, scrolling requires repeated movement across the huge trackpad. On the other side, the trackpad makes movements quite accurate.\n2. KEYBOARD IS HEATING. Even when you power on and do nothing. The area with the highest temperature is around F12. Fan policy is too conservative. To my observation, it seems that fan will only spin when you play games. Also, backspace and enter keys are too small.\n3. Windows 10 issues. I have to manually update ethernet controller's driver at realtek's website. Otherwise it keeps losing connection beyond 30 minutes of use and cause a stutter per 10 seconds. I also turned off the quick boot. Not sure which is the real solution here, but you may want to try both.

Specs are fantastic, price is right, screen is excellent (outside of some backlight bleed at the bottom on a pure black screen).\n\nSo, given all that, why did i return it after just a few days?\n\nThe touchpad/trackpad is atrocious.\n\nThe main flaw with the touchpad is the deadzone when making small movements. Lets say your cursor is on the maximize window button, and you want to go just slightly to the right to close the window instead. You begin moving your finger across the trackpad, and for approximately 1cm, nothing will occur on the screen. Suddenly, the driver will decide \"alright, you've moved far enough\" and then jump your cursor to where it would have been if it were moving the whole time, way past the close button. You can then circle back to wherever you were trying to click.\n\nThis occurs because of a driver dispute between Dell and Microsoft on the new precision trackpads. Search the web a bit for the issue, as it's happening on new xps laptops, new inspirons, as well as some Acer ones and even the new surfacebook.\n\nIf you never plan on using the touchpad, this is a great machine, 5/5 stars, completely recommend it. But if you do plan on using the touchpad, stay far far away, as it's completely unusable, with no sign of a fix in sight (Microsoft says it's Dell's fault, and vice versa)."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "The laptop is a nice quality machine. However, there are some issues:\n\nThe touchpad is not great. It's something you have to get used to. I tried to adjust it, turned off all the gestures except the very necessary. It helped somehow, but still it could be better.\n\nThe sound is not clear, it comes out as if the speakers are inside the computer.\n\nFrom small issues to larger: the machine is not as fast as I thought it will be. Even playing Path of Exile, which is not a most demanding game, sometimes the screen freezes for half of the second and then speeds the animation up. I bought this laptop because comparing to other similar priced computers, it had better processor. Maybe I just expect too much, and there's not much you can get out of a laptop in general.\n\nMy biggest worry is overheating. Even when performing simple tasks, the laptop is warm. As measured by CPUID HWMonitor, constant temperature is around 50C (125F). When playing games, it goes up, so that I can feel heat even under the keyboard. The fan system is huge, you can see it on the images in other reviews, but still... I wonder why no other review mentions heating.\n\nEdit:\nIt seems that the cooling system lets the CPU heat until 70C (160F), and then the fan starts working loudly until the temperature goes down. The temperature doesn't disturb me and doesn't make using the laptop less comfortable.\nI played other games (again, not very demanding): Mafia II, Team Fortress 2, Dota 2, NFS Carbon, and there was no problem with these games at all. I increase my rating from 3 to 4 stars."}

I have been gaming (Starcraft2, Skyrim, Sims3, Minecraft, Bioshock series) with it since I got it and have had no issues.  It stays fairly quiet, the only time it had made noise was during extended gaming sessions (3+hours), but that's just the fan keeping things cool.  It multitasks wonderfully, I have had 0 issues with it so far but it is brand new so that remains to be seen.\n\nAesthetically it is very well rounded.  The keys feel nice and solid, the backlighting feature is awesome and it's great to have a num pad on it for math homework and programming. It's made of a soft-ish feeling plastic but it does not feel cheap. It does tend to get smudgy pretty quick but it's also really easy to just wipe the smudges off with a cloth or even a shirt sleeve.  The only thing I don't really like is the touchpad.  It's awkward and clunky.  It's not really sensitive enough IMHO, scrolling and clicking can be kind of annoying and it is noisier than I would like. My cheap chromebook has a much better touchpad than this thing, I was kinda bummed Dell couldn't do better in that regard. I usually carry a wireless mouse with me though so it's rarely an issue and I wouldn't ding it a star just for that."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "Ordered this laptop with high hopes for it as the parts in it looked really good for the price. I must say, you're getting a lot for your money. I'm not the biggest gamer in the world but there is one game I play and that is Borderlands 2. I can run at max settings (Physx on low because that drops frames for even some of the best gaming pc's) at 55-60 fps while not charging. When it's charging it just about always runs 60 fps even when I turn Physx up to medium. It does get a little warm in the top left corner of the laptop about where the speaker is when running Borderlands but it's not too bad. Sometimes I can hear the fan decently loud, but it's a really smooth sound. Borderlands 2 is not an easy game to run at max settings by any means. I'm actually in college right now so I didn't even get this totally for gaming, like I said, only thing in gaming is that I just wanted to run BL2 smoothly. This thing is FAST. Very quick start up, obviously having an SSD. Has an empty slot which I plan to plug the 1tb hdd from my last laptop in to. I personally am not sure why everyone is talking about screen bleed because I don't see any and that was the one thing that scared me when reading the reviews. The screen is BEAUTIFUL and the colors look amazing. The keyboard is pretty decent and I like how quiet it is. I usually type pretty hard, but I don't hear much out of this keyboard other than the spacebar but that's normal because it's such a big key. The backlighting of the keyboard is amazing. It doesn't just stay on, the light actually fades out after about 30 seconds (haven't timed it) and turns back on as soon as you hit a key. For a laptop, the speakers are actually great quality and can get pretty loud for laptop speakers without losing quality. I never really used my pc/laptop speakers before this, I have just used my Bose headphones but I can actually stand the speakers in this. The battery lasts about 6+ hours with moderate use with it leaning more towards performance so I know if you set it to longer battery life you would get more than 7 hours out of it. But heavy gaming drains the battery real quick as in about 3 and a half hours from full down to 10%. The build quality is really nice, I love the way it feels and looks. It doesn't LOOK like a gaming laptop. No one else even knows I bought what Dell considered a gaming laptop, they just think it's a really good laptop (Which it is.). But I didn't buy it to be a gaming laptop, and before I bought it I thought of it as just a great laptop, with great parts, that will run fast. Especially for the money. But now that I've had it for a few days, I know that you could call it a dedicated mid-range gaming laptop. It seems to compete with gaming laptops priced at about 1100-1300 from what I've tested of them (Never really owned them so I can't say anything about long term. I've only tested some out.). I honestly don't have an complaints about this purchase so far. As far as laptops go I've had an Asus and an HP, both of which I had to send in within a month after I got them for having issues that were noticeable within a days. If I run into any issues I'll update but as of now, this thing is a very reasonably, maybe even under-priced, beast that is definitely worth taking a look at and comparing to other options. The other laptop I was looking at was the ASUS K501UX (which is a little cheaper as of right now, but not by much.) because I really did like my last ASUS, but I'm glad I bought this as it is MILES better than my last rig. I chose this one because it was newer, and it is quad-core instead of dual. Also, I don't need an i7 especially with these 6th gen cores, and this is a really good i5 core. Not worth getting an i7. Plus the ASUS looks like my last one and the build quality on that didn't feel nearly as nice as this. Anyways, I think that's enough praise for now. Good luck with your shopping and again, make sure to take this laptop into consideration."}

Most if the others will be more expensive and if you want something at the same price, like an hp envy, you won't be getting the sheer processing power and graphics that this has. The SSD is a nice addition and the 8gb of RAM and 4gb of Graphics are more than enough for almost anyone. Unless you're a hard core gamer, this computer won't even be phased. The matte black looks really cool, but oil shows up on it very easily."}

For the display driver crashing issues, search on Google \"Intel HD Graphics 530 Driver\" and install the beta version. The beta has seemed to solve most of my issues, especially with Firefox. To install that driver, uninstall the current driver on the laptop, otherwise you will get an error during install.\nEDIT 9/9/17: The laptop is still working great 2 years after I purchased it. However, the frame is starting to come apart, even with careful handling. Many other reviewers have also posted about this issue. Would recommend staying away if looking to purchase this at a discount somewhere."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "It runs Linux! More on that later in the review!\n\nUPDATE 2: Added pics of the screen light bleed and of the display in bright sunlight compared with my Toshiba Chromebook 2's glossy IPS display. Note that while the Chromebook's display looks pretty hard to read in the picture, it was easily usable in that lighting condition and I had no trouble seeing what I was doing on it as I sat in that exact spot and browsed the web for an hour or so. The Inspiron's display, however, looks even better than the Chromebook's in the pictures, and looked fantastic in real life. The matte finish really helped glare, and the screen was plenty bright enough to read everything perfectly.\n\nUPDATE: I put TF2 on my linux install, and it plays goregously at maxed settings native resolution. This is the game I play most often so the fact that this laptop maxes it out handily reinforces my very good impression of the hardware. Again, temps stayed below 75 CPU and below 70 GPU. Fan noise was definitely audible, but fairly reasonable and quiet.\n\nSHORT REVIEW:\nBuild Quality: 7/10\nPerformance: 9/10\nScreen: 8/10\nKeyboard/Trackpad: 8/10\nConnectivity: 9/10 (no VGA)\nMaintainability: 10/10\n\nThese specs for this price are a no brainer assuming nothing else big is wrong, and I haven't found a problem yet (in Windows, Linux has had a couple issues). Plays modern games on high settings 60fps and will do so for a couple more years. I really love it so far, and I should have pics of the only issue I've found, a small light bleed on the bottom of the screen when the entire screen is black. Overall, I highly recommend.\n\nLONG REVIEW:\n I just got this laptop today. Build quality is good, but unimpressive. The laptop feels quite solid and does not flex when force is applied to anywhere on the chassis or keyboard. It is plastic, but feels rather nice and does not appear to retain smudges. With the Windows setup out of the way, the laptop is already very snappy. Programs execute extremely fast between the 45W i5 and the SSD Windows is installed on. I ran a few browser benchmarks preliminarily for fun in Chrome. Sunspider1.0.2 gave a score of 205 ms, BrowserMark returned 3700, and Octane 29000.\n\nNot only is the SSD that comes with the laptop quite fast (Windows boots in approximately 15 seconds from the time you press the power button), it has an easily accessible 2.5\" SATA bay (lacking screws to secure the drives, sadly) open for another drive. A hatch secured with 1 screw covers about 7/8ths of the laptop's bottom, so accessibility for drive swaps and RAM upgrades and cooling system maintenance will be excellent. I installed a Samsung Series 840 SSD in the 2.5\" bay and it worked immediately. The keyboard and trackpad are good in my opinion, but I am not a connoisseur of such things. The screen is big, bright and sharp. I can't say how it fares in sun yet because today has been rather cloudy, but I'll update my review with that information, as well as usage info and potentially pictures, once I've had the laptop for longer. Speakers are good for a laptop, they sound ok. The touchpad is responsive and relatively accurate. It's good, but it's no MacBook touchpad. The keyboard backlight is quite nice, pleasantly bright.\n\nHeat and noise are only a bit more noticeable on this than my fanless chromebook, a 2014 Toshiba Chromebook 2. Even when under load in Windows playing Viscera Cleanup Detail Shadow Warrior on nearly maxed settings, the device was relatively quiet, and temps stayed under 75 for CPU and under 70 GPU. I did not feel heat then because it was on the table, but now writing this review the laptop has a 58 degree CPU temp and the laptop feels slightly warm in my lap but in no way uncomfortable. The system is pretty big in length and width, barely fitting in my backpack, but despite this it is pretty thin, about the same as my chromebook in a hard plastic shell case. I don't think the laptop is heavy in particular, but I am a poor judge of weight. Wireless signal has been strong and consistent since I first entered the password, so I have great faith in the wireless chip in this unit. I will update with Ethernet connection quality when I've tested it. USB connections are very fast, as I found when making my Linux bootable to install my dual boot.\n\nMy luck with Linux has been good! This is a crucial section of the review because Linux functionality is very important to me, so I took a big risk in preordering this unit in terms of potential device issues that would force me to use Windows exclusively. I burned an Ubuntu MATE 15.10 iso in windows 10 using the Pendrivelinux universal USB installer tool onto my flash drive, and when tested on my desktop the live USB worked flawlessly. On my laptop, I inserted the USB into my right USB port (this is likely of no significance, only stated for reference), rebooted and pressed f12 repeatedly before the Dell logo pops up and when the Dell logo appears, a small box will be in the bottom of the screen with words about \" F12 = BootMenu\" and was brought to the menu for UEFI secure boot options. One of them was my USB drive, so I booted it. I got to a GRUB menu that let me select \"Try ubuntu without installing\" and \"Install ubuntu\", among other options. I tried both of these, and the computer would get to the Ubuntu MATE splash screen and then freeze. I fixed this by pressing \"e\" over the \"Try ubuntu without installing\" option and adding \"nomodeset\" to the boot arguments right after \"splash\" and finally pressing f10. This allowed me to boot to the Ubuntu desktop and use the install client. Install went without a hitch, everything downloaded and installed very quickly, and web browsing system performance over the live USB was very snappy and responsive despite the install loads in the background. I partitioned the SSD I inserted, which mounted as \"sdb\", into 20gb ext4 to mount as \"/\" and 90gb ext4 to mount as \"/home\", then the rest as a swap partition. Install was a breeze, but when I rebooted and selected Ubuntu in the GRUB boot loader menu, I had similar video issues as the splash screen issue from the live USB. I fixed this the same way but without accessing the UEFI boot menu: by rebooting the laptop and waiting for the GRUB boot loader to appear, hovering over \"Ubuntu\", and adding \"nomodeset\" again after \"splash\" in the text that appeared and once again pressing f10. I got a login screen! First things first, install the NVIDIA drivers you need to make this annoying boot argument unnecessary and allow your laptop to function and boot normally. \"sudo apt-get install nvidia-352\" in terminal, enter your password, and follow instructions, if any appear. After this, reboot normally and verify that the driver being used by the system is the proprietary NVIDIA 352 driver and not the opensource Nouveau driver. If you encounter display problems one last time on this reboot, again press \"e\" over Ubuntu and append \"nomodeset\" to your boot arguments and you'll be fine. If on reboot the system is using a driver other than the proprietary NVIDIA 352 driver, change it to that. You now have a fully functioning Linux system! The only really noticeable bug is an occasional freeze on wakeup from sleep when you close the laptop, which is supposedly related to the Intel integrated graphics driver I believe and likely will be fixed. Otherwise, the laptop has been great. In practice the battery lasts about 6 hours of web browsing with high display brightness. Not great, but at least decent for a gaming laptop. Windows appears to do markedly better than Linux for battery life, sadly."}

Super fast and quiet, beautiful screen, (I don't think there is any bleed on my screen. If I have, it is really not noticeable) great sound overall.\n\nI'm a graduate student and consider myself a gamer, although I don't have much time for it anymore. This laptop is perfect for my needs, bc it has a great cpu and gpu, so I can throw all kinds of programs and games in there, and it shouldn't be a problem. I didn't have time to install any games yet, but I'm soon gonna be able to do it. (I can't wait to play The Witcher, Far Cry, Skyrim, Fallout 4 in some weeks, and a few others)\n\nThose are the features that are standing out for me on the first day:\n+ Beautiful IPS screen\n+ Super fast (it takes 15 to 20 seconds to boot up, which is ages ahead of my 5 year old Toshiba Satellite)\n+ Good battery ( I have been using this for 4 hours and a half setting up the laptop, watching videos and listening to music, and I still have 50% of the battery left)\n+ Great sound (Although I use my headphones almost always, I was impressed by how loud the speakers are. But have in mind that the bass is not  gonna be very strong, this is still a laptop we are talking about)\n+ I like how the audio jack and the charger goes to the left side of it, so I have my right side free to have a mouse and play my games\n+ I love how easy it is to open the back of the laptop and install another SSD and/or Memory. I haven't done it myself, but will be upgrading it soon.\n+ It doesn't look like a gaming laptop, so I could take it to work or classes and people wouldn't be looking any different (as they would if I show up with an Alienware or MSI for example lol)\n\nNow there are a few things that could be done differently, but they are very small annoyances, nothing to be worried about.\n- I use a mouse always, but I wasn't impressed by the touch pad. I have found better ones on cheaper laptops. But hey, if you are using the touch pad to play games, you are not a serious gamer lol. Another thing is that I think the touch pad should be more on the right side. I still have space for the left hand to press W,A,S,D while playing, but its not very much.\n- Although the backlit keyboard works wonderfully, I was't impressed by the keyboard itself. It's not bad, really! But it's not amazing also. It's an OK keyboard.\n- The laptop is a little bit on the heavy side, but again its not too bad. I'm still gonna be able to put it in my backpack and go to work and classes just fine. I just wish it would be lighter. The battery charger is very heavy, I had never seen one so bulky before, but I'm still OK with that.\n\nOverall, I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase, I searched a lot for a good gaming laptop under $1000, and this was the best one you could find. If you consider everything this baby has to offer, $800 is really cheap. If you are not sure about getting it, I would say yes, go ahead! I don't think you will regret it! Way to go Dell!!!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "I'll echo some of the sentiments already posted here and say this is a very nice laptop, especially for the price. It handles light gaming quite well (I have a fondness for older(ish) games, so I haven't really pressed it yet) and that is to be expected with the GTX 960m.\n\nPros:\n-The SSD is an m. 2 and so the SATA drive bay is empty. That is a good thing, because I've used up most of the 256GB downloading steam games...\n-The screen is very nice, though there does seem to be a bit of screen bleed. As others have mentioned it is really only noticeable when the screen is black.\n-I LOVE the chassis access panel. One screw, a couple of small pops and you have access to most anything you may need (m. 2, SATA, memory...)\n-The keyboard is passable, if not compliant. I don't mind it, and the backlight is nice.\n\nCons:\n-Some don't like the soft plastic feel, but it seems sturdy and, at the very least, pleasant enough.\n-Slight screen bleed at the bottom (as mentioned in pros).\n-While portable this laptop is definitely not an ultrabook, and it does have some heft to it. (Honestly Im reaching hereits not terribly heavy).\n\nOther:\n-The RAM is only one chip (in one of two slots), and rather than just purchase an additional 8GB I decided to upgrade to CAS 9 memory, so I went with a 2x 8GB set of DDR3L running @ 1600 (PC3L 12800). While this isn't necessary to go with a whole new set, I would at least recommend buying a second 8GB chip, so the memory can run in dual channel. And at least now I have a 8GB chip I can sell\n-Windows 10 is taking some getting used to, but familiar enough and Ive enjoyed it so far.\n-I haven't been able to properly test the battery, but it seems good, as long as you aren't pushing the system too hard. I cant stand the thought of gaming on battery power anyways\n\nThis laptop had all that I needed and it was a no-brainer @ the pre-sale price (eight hundred). $80 for the RAM upgrade and waiting for a good SATA SSD sale to really up the storage! Very happy with this purchase!\n\n<update>\nAlmost 2 weeks in and I'm still very satisfied with this purchase, and I'd like to mention that Dell did things correctly by not filling this thing with bloatware out of the gate. McAfee is all you need to really ditch right away (and maybe a couple of Dell Assistance programs). I've got several hours in with a number of games and the hardest I've pressed the system has probably been Borderlands 2, which runs very near 60 fps on very high settings. I know this is an old(ish) game, but I was feeling nostalgic...\n\nTwo things continue to vex me:\n-The fingerprints...oh, the fingerprints!! The left side of the chassis looks almost comically smudged and the right side is pristine =)\n-Num Lock is set to off by default and I can't seem to get it to boot to on. Not seeing the option in the BIOS, but if anyone wants to clue me in on how to change the default status I'd be very grateful. This is made especially frustrating due to the fact that one of the first thing windows asks you to do is set up a pin for logging in!\n</update>\n\n<update_2>\nI wanted to get some answers regarding the capability of the m. 2 slot (PCIe vs SATA based) and after putting in my service tag information Dell's website shows \"Our records show that your Dell product support warranty has expired.\"\n\nUH-OH!!\n\nWell I have contacted Dell support via the phone and they have assured me that the warranty is valid for this laptop, however it is a new product, so the warranty information has not been successfully added to their system as of yet! They confirmed my \"Depot Repair Warranty\" expires as of 10/30/2016. If you have any concerns about the warranty I suggest you call them.\n\nAlso Dell support confirmed that the m. 2 slot is only capable of utilizing SATA drives, so no PCIe...Hope this helps!\n</update_2>"}

That in turn cause cracking around the rear left edge of the case.

The unit was carefully handled, never abused and never dropped.  Some queries for Dell broken hinge found numerous threads about owners experiencing similar issues to my own.  The problem is 100% due to either a design or manufacturing defect yet this is not covered under warranty since Dell considers it normal wear.

It might be OK for someone who leaves the lid open permanently to avoid any use of the hinges at all, but for owners like myself that need to be able to open and close it multiple times per day, you're better off looking for something more reliable.. I can't recommend buying this model due to the quality being this poor."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B015PYYDMQ", "review": "At first, I loved this laptop. I bought it two years ago as a present to myself, since I'd never had a gaming laptop before and was just starting to really get into video games. (The irony I suppose is that, apart from a couple of games which really do need a good graphics card and processor, most of what I play . . . doesn't. But I digress.)\n\nOf course, as soon as the year warranty wore off, I started having issues. The computer will get caught in a cycle where the keyboard is frozen, the screen is black, but it can't be shut off, period, until the battery dies. Then when I reboot it, it's fine. The repair technicians I took it to suggested it was a hardware issue, but I wasn't able at the time to spend the money needed to repair it . . . so I just deal with it. The screen has started to flicker. A keycap has come off and refuses to stay on. And two out of the three USB ports are already not working properly, with intermittent connectivity.\n\nAnd then, of course, there's the lack of a disc drive. I have an external one now, and it was my fault for not realizing this computer doesn't have one, but . . . it's kind of a pain in the butt to have to spend money on something else, just to be able to play a DVD or hypothetically install a game from a CD (because not all of it's on Steam :P).\n\nLittle stuff like that makes it hard to like this computer, given its price and relative age. I had an HP which lasted forever and was tough as nails. I think that once this finishes dying its slow death, I'm going to go back to one of those. I certainly didn't have to take it in for service--ever--and I'm constantly debating with myself if it's worth sinking the extra money into my Dell to get it fixed up. It's two years old! I shouldn't be having to have that debate."}

I bought this 1.5 years ago and it literally came apart at the left hinge. Dell will not cover it or take responsibility for faulty hinges. It's a manufacturing issue that you should be aware of before purchasing."}
