And it's one of the few laptops these days that still comes with a built in disc drive making it a great computer for games as well as office work..

But the tabs are almost too small to see! and the skype is just fuzzy enough to be annoying. If I try zooming in  just a bit its way too huge.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "I pre-ordered 2 in mid August and they arrived last week after they were released. That being said, I cannot speak about long term use, however the pros and cons I've found so far:\n\nFirst the cons:\n- I had to submit a claim for a replacement only a few hours after opening 1 of the laptops. The touch pad completely stopped working while setting up the computer. No food or drinks were involved, it just started to get spotty then stop working all together.  A mouse could fix this, however if a problem happened within the first few hours, I was worried it could happen again to another feature. Overall the touch pad feels a little cheap.\n- (This is my personal mistake) I should have went with a laptop with a faster processor. There's no doubt in your mind that it's an i3 processor. I don't know if they should use \"powerful\" in the description as it could be misleading.\n\nThe pros:\n- It's very sleek looking. You really can't leave fingerprint marks on it. When you open it up, the keyboard is very nice and the buttons are spaced evenly apart so you don't have to worry about clicking other keys when typing.\n- It comes with 10 key. Very helpful for those who are used to using a regular keyboard.\n- The screen is a good size for the price. For this price, the 11\" screens are more often seen.\n- Quality of resolution is great when you're watching movies or looking at photos.\n- Relatively quick setup.\n- Comes with Windows 10, which seems to have gone back to making it look more like you're using a PC rather than a phone or tablet.\n- Memory is higher than other laptops that are normally the same price. If you can find one that has a good size memory in this price range, they'll lack some of the features you can find with this computer.\n- Upon first glance, the RAM looks easy enough to upgrade.\n- It actually comes a DVD-RW/CD-RW drive. We still use this a lot so I wanted something that had it built in.\n- Battery life is decent. Maybe about 3 hours, you could maybe push 4 if you're conservative on usage.\n\nI think there are more pros than cons for this computer, however if you're going to be doing some real gaming or using some high powered programs, than I'd look into something else. It's a really nice computer for casual use though."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "A nice solid laptop. For the price you can't expect much, the pre-order price made a it a no brainer, you would be hard pressed to find another laptop sub $400 with a full 1080p display. Battery life seems to be about 3 hours from my experience, that's a combo of installing application, web browsing and writing code.\n\nIf you don't have any intention of gaming, you will find this to be a wonderful laptop. The integrated Intel, while they are progressing, can't hold a candle to a real dedicated GPU. Battery life isn't as great as I was hoping, but not bad. It can still be mobile, but not the 5-6 hours I've had in a nice quad core i7 mac book pro from way back in 2011. The hard drive does seem fast enough for normal use. Keyboard is okay, not great but seems to work for what I need.\n\nPros\n1080p <-- this is what pushes it to the top of the budget laptops in my book. (developer)\nPretty thin and lite.\nEnough processing power.\nEnough memory.\n\nCons, not really cons just really considerations.\nIt's a mobile i3, not for heavy processing.\n4gb of memory, I routinely see 60-70% usage\n5,400rpm drive, not a deal breaker but in the world of SSD's, its pretty slow.\nTrackpad feels pretty cheap.\n\nThere is some extra junk installed, but it wasn't hard to remove. I have since ordered another 4gb stick of memory and a SSD but have not installed it yet. From what I've found out the upgrade process is a lot more work than it should be. Also I have not been able to find any real specs or manual online or in the box for this specific model to tell you things like, the max memory supported etc.\n\nThis is all subjective to my experience, your mileage will vary.\n\nAfter having read my review, it's pretty indecisive. I want to say that for normal day to day use, it will serve you well. Just no gaming or heavy processing."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "Main takeaway: I'm very pleased with the purchase overall and highly recommend it to anyone who needs a laptop for everyday usage.  Remember especially that many people over-buy or get talked into things they don't need.  The i3 in this system is more than capable of performing the majority of tasks most users will require of it.  Gamers who need a video card capable of running the latest and greatest new releases will need to look elsewhere, but this laptop should be fine for anyone who will be mostly surfing the internet, watching streaming videos, listening to music, writing emails, working with word processing, etc.\n\nRemember that buying it with certain credit cards (American Express, Visa Signature, others?) will automatically double the manufacturer's 12 month warranty.\n\nPros:\n\n- At $350 shipped, it's essentially a $300 laptop with specs appropriate to the price and a $50 full-HD 1080p screen.  Maybe the market is moving to HD at this price point, but I doubt there are many systems out there with these specs/screen at this price.  I was considering a Chromebook or the like, but for $100 (or less) I got a fully functional PC with a full HD screen.  Wow.\n\n- Battery life after unpacking and charging overnight shows 4.5 hours on the battery  saver setting.  I suspect 3-4 hours is probably realistic once it's being used.\n\n- The screen looks great with a bit of light bleeding on the bottom edge of mine.  It's only noticeable in a dark room while watching a dark movie, so I'm possibly being overly critical.  Again, $350, and wow.  The viewing angles are okay but I'm sure they'd look horrible if placed next to a $2000 laptop.\n\n- Not a touch screen.  That may be in the \"con\" section for some, but I've got an ultrabook that I never, ever use the touchscreen on.  I'm sort of glad this one doesn't have it in order to minimize failures and faults that could potentially be associated with it.\n\n- Touchpad - Most importantly, it doesn't appear to interfere with or affect typing.  The left and right buttons are incorporated into the design and there is no edge between them.  The buttons have a fairly loud click when used, although the touchpad can be used when a bit more silence is desired or required.\n\n- Keyboard feels good even though it doesn't have the tactile feedback I prefer.  It's positioned well overall and is responsive.\n\n- Windows 10 will take some adjusting to, but I am fairly impressed with how quickly it boots even with the factory 5400RPM hard drive.\n\n- RAM has a hatch for easy upgrading (see photo), and there's an empty slot available to add another stick.  Remove the little circular plug cover to expose a screw, then you can remove the cover.  I've attached CPU-Z info and screengrabs of the RAM and SSD upgrades recommended by Crucial using their scanner.  I'm not recommending or endorsing them, just offering the data in case anyone needs it or wants to cross reference with other drives/RAM that may fit.\n\n- The lid is plastic and textured very subtly, so no fingerprints.\n\nCons:\n\n- Bare bones 4GB RAM and 500GB 5400RPM HDD, although I'm certain that's a large part of the reason they can sell at this price.\n\n- HDD is not easy to replace.  There is a video on youtube titled \"Asus F555L Disassembly for Hard Disk Replacement\" that shows how, but it's not as easy as it could be, unfortunately.  It appears that the lower cover is structural now, so be careful when you take it apart.\n\n- A bit of flex in the keyboard, but I don't think it's inappropriate for a laptop in this price range.\n\n- No discs for factory restore or option to create them with Asus software that I could find, so be sure to use the Windows backup option as soon as you receive the system.  Search for \"file history\" and Backup and Restore (Windows 7)."}

This last time, ASUS claimed the warranty is out so they won't do anything, even though its been an ongoing problem. Fortunately I bought squaretrade's replacement plan so I will get it fixed again, but I'll only have it as a back-up computer from now on. I used this computer to run windows office, web browsers, and a couple of small engineering programs such as HEC-RAS. When this computer does work, it manages these things fine, but it really craps out a lot. Also ASUS customer service is abysmal. The first time it broke down they had it for two weeks, then sent it back to me saying they fixed the LED screen. There was never a problem with the screen, and they didn't fix the boot problems so I had to send it right back to them, getting charged for shipping both times. I ended up not having my computer for a month, which is extremely inconvenient for a student like myself. I will never buy an ASUS product again, and you shouldn't either."}

The initial boot-up was phenomenal and everything worked beautifully!\nThen, about 6 months into regular use, my hard drive crashed and never recovered. Upon calling Asus tech support, I realized that because my \"6\" key on my number pad was missing and I had a few surface scratches, that they would not repair my laptop at their closest repair center to me, which is in Georgia, but instead, required me to ship it out to California to their main repair branch. So what looked like a 4 day max operation turned into an almost 2 week long wait to get something as simple as a hard drive replaced (which also took them 2 days to do, on top of the 10 TOTAL day shipping).\nNot to mention, the laptop as is will not be a gaming machine unless you like running all your games on low settings due to the motherboard having Intel 5500 integrated HD graphics. And the hard drive is dated, and I mean DATED! The hard drive itself isn't even running at 7,200 RPM and is instead a 500 GB HGST hard drive from around 2013 operating at 5,400 RPM. The processor is weak, but gets most tasks done. The screen is phenomenal. The sound on the laptop is pretty nice as well, so I would say there are some good sides to this machine.\nAlso, if you want more RAM, just buy a 4GB or 8GB 204 pin DDR3L stick and this computer will be able to handle a heavier load considering that Windows 10 on this machine uses about 3.5 GB of the 4GB you're given at purchase. There is a compartment on the back that you have to unscrew and open to add in the new RAM as well, but there are YouTube videos for that kind of thing!"}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "~330$ for a full-sized Asus laptop seemed like a good deal. But, comparing with my last Asus (purchased 2009, ~$700, still runs, I eventually had to replace because I dropped it and plastic cracked, exposing wires), I feel like I should have saved up for something that might last a bit longer.\n\nThis computer is only a year old, and I took about 6 months to get around to using it. I've never dropped it or spilled anything on it, so it should run perfectly. However:\na) three screws have come loose from the bottom of the computer. I tried screwing them back in but they wouldn't stay. So I examined them and found they'd all been undermined by a line of blue paint, which is also in the computer. Poor manufacturing! If I lose one more screw the base will come apart :)\nb) there's something wrong with the sound (issue began after only 3 months of use). it seems to be a driver problem -- while any type of audio is playing through any speakers/headphones, I periodically get a bluescreen which says \"dpc watchdog violation.\" Supposedly easy to correct: update drivers, or uninstall/reinstall. But the problem persists despite my efforts. Based on a number of random audio symptoms, and the ineffectiveness of software fixes, I'm beginning to wonder whether the problem isn't hardware-related\nc) The other day I got an orange (!) screen for the first time ever. Apparently this means an issue with graphics card, too? Whatever!\nd) The computer has always run relatively slowly. This may be a result of Windows' bloatware, but that's part of what you're buying here. (You have to jump through a ton of hoops to delete programs as an administrator these days.)\n\nMy point is, I've wasted a lot of time coddling this stupid machine. It's very young to be having so many problems. It runs, but at what cost...\n\nIf you want a quickly disposable computer, this is the way to go. Not worth 300+ imho"}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "When I first got it, i experiences all the positive reviews and really loved what I got for the price. However, it started running slowly sometimes after six months. I uninstalled some programs and reinstalled windows multiple times, until one day it started crashing constantly (blue screen). I've had two RMAs with Asus. The first one was the laptop's HDD not being recognized; whenever I turned it on it would stay on the Aptio Setup Utility as if there was no hard drive to boot from. They sent it back saying a keyboard component was replaced; which was obviously wrong since it crashed 30 minutes after I turned it back on. I sent it back the second time and they replaced the motherboard; it was working fine for a couple of days and now it's back to crashing. After the second RMA, I had already ran out of my one-year warranty and could not afford to send it back to the repair shop so now I'm currently saving up for a new laptop.\n\nIt's possible that I was unlucky and received a bad model, and I will say that Asus has very fast customer support. Unfortunately, mines was not worth all the trouble."}

I contacted customer support and they advised me to reset the computer. I did that but the problem persisted. So I will have to contact them again. However, I do regret buying this laptop and I feel like next time, I should have bought a more expensive laptop that was more reputable instead of saving on this one. And don't tell me that this is a random issue because now Ive seen other customers issues and there is no way its random if so many customers are experiencing problems as well! Ive noticed that the reviews are a lot less positive than a year ago, which says a lot about how this laptop functions long-term. It must be some defect in the computer/poor quality control which may disturbingly be intentional. Either way, I will not buy from this brand again!"}

I needed it to browse internet, stream shows via my cable company website and for sites like Cricut, a design space for crafting. I don't use it frequently. I had one repair done within the first year due to the fact that the chord stopped charging the laptop, tech support was okay and mailing it in to get it fixed within the warranty time was pretty painless. However, now it freezes and makes a grinding sound so that I have to hard reboot it. This tends to happen while watching videos or streaming. Also the mouse icon will fail to show up when I turn it on, and I have to keep hard rebooting it until the mouse icon appears AND actually works, since sometimes it appears but won't move when I try to use the touch pad. Thought about buying a mouse but aggravated that I have to. I'm not even sure I want to deal with tech support again simply b/c it's time consuming and I'm aggravated that a gently used device is so much trouble. Bought this in April 2016, it's 13 months later, and just never felt the laptop was able to handle what I do which doesn't seem like much and it has not been used frequently by any means."}

Not this time. From the first day I noticed that the computer was particularly slow especially when it came to surfing the internet. At first I thought that maybe there was a lot of traffic on the web so I thought nothing of it. The next time the same thing happened. It took ages buffering before it could open any page. So out of curiosity I whipped out my older ASUS laptop/tablet and logged onto the same site I had been waiting eons for this new laptop to open. Presto it opened in an instant. I surfed to my hearts content and when i was finished and had shut down that older laptop this new horrible contraption still had not loaded the page! Still not wanting to draw any firm conclusion yet I decided that perhaps because I had not updated somethings that may be the cause. Ergo i dutifully upgraded everything it prompted me to do. No improvement! This still takes looooooooooooooooooooooong to load anything and I have given up using it. Right now it is a rather expensive paperweight on my desk! What a waste of money!"}

As well, one side of the flip-up screen has started to make a cracking noise when I open or close it, apparently it has become misaligned. I use this 99% at home, so it hasn't been handled roughly. My last laptop (a Dell) has lasted over 8 years and looks and feels just as solid and sturdy as it did the day I got it, so this feels cheap to me. (OTOH, my Dell cost 3x as much!

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "I've had this laptop for over 6 months now and figured that is enough time for a review. This laptop gets me through the day for basic needs: web browsing, streaming and downloading music/videos via Youtube/ Spotify/ \"new movie\" websites, working on Word, Excel and Photoshop (not included). I find I can like do some work in those programs or browse the web while streaming music and downloading a video at the same time and it won't slow down the computer too much. However, if I put the laptop into \"sleep\" mode (while my programs are still opened) and turn it back on later, the laptop is super slow and I have to close all my programs and restart the laptop.\n\nThis laptop has a good screen size where I can do work or watch movies. The screen is 1080p so movies are pretty sharp. Weight depends on what you're used to, but I think it has an average weight where I don't mind carrying it in a backpack. Battery life is average (5 1/2 hours browsing using wi-fi).\n\nOverall, very good bang for my buck. I'm a mid-20's professional who just needed a basic laptop for browsing, streaming/downloading and working from home sometimes without spending lots of money. If you fall into that category, this laptop is for you."}

Its an HGST brand hard drive running at 5400rpm, while I'm sure that there are plenty of people that have not had any issues out of this disk I personally would like to throw it in the trash and never look back. It is insanely loud when it kicks on and it kicks on and off ALL THE TIME.  After having it a little over a year the hard drive has taken a turn for the worse. The speed of the disk will make you pull your hair out. I attatched an image of a benchmark I ran on the drive before replacing it with a SSD.\n\nIt needs more RAM. You really only need 4gb extra here, I mean... what are you going to be doing on THIS laptop that will require 12gb total RAM? Save the $20 and buy a 4gb stick.\n\nNow the good news.\n\nIt is a fantastic laptop all around for the value. I have always trusted Asus to deliver great and reliable laptops and computer components and this one has not disappointed. Keyboard feels great and the touchpad is responsive. My only gripe about the keyboard is that there are no lights indicating caps lock or num pad is on... little bit frustrating but not a deal breaker.\nThe screen is great and not something you see usually in this price range. (yep...that's it about the screen.)\nThe outside of the laptop is great, it looks wonderful closed and open. It doesn't get hot where your wrists will settle and doesn't cut into your wrists like some laptops I have had in the past.\n\nAll in all it is a good laptop and I gave it 4 stars because in all honesty if I wanted to buy a laptop and swap out the HDD for a SSD and add some RAM to make it faster... this would have been one I would have gone for. It is a great price range and has a great processor and a wonderful screen. Did I buy this one thinking that I would replace and upgrade these things? No... I did not."}

At first, it was hands down the best laptop I ever owned; it was a nice size, great resolution, high speed, portable, and extremely functional. Unfortunately, about 6 months passed and I was no longer able to use the sound. I reinstalled drivers, tried different software, and numerous other methods. Nothing worked. No big deal, I only used it for a few study videos for class and Netflix in my down time. Not a problem. Another 6 or so weeks passed and my computer has been randomly crashing ever since. More times than I can count I've lost documents, powerpoints, excel spreadsheets and more due to random systemic failures. From time to time, it'll have a period of good sportsmanship and I'm able to knock out copious amounts of work and I assume all is well and whatever problem I had before must have resolved itself. Moments later, I'm sitting in front of the screen, mouth open, desperately trying to recover work or prevent the PC from restarting itself at this immensely inconvenient time.

The wireless connection is horrible, and even upgrading to the latest RealTek drivers from Asus have not fixed it.  You have to try to connect to a network 3-4 times before a connection goes though (even though you have an IP, proper netmask, DNS servers, and a gateway).

When I asked for a supervisor I would have hold times longer than 40 mins and just gave up. This is an Indian-owned company, they hire people in India. They do not invest in their support staff and IF you have a problem you are going to be speaking to someone with HORRIBLE English. I am all for companies only investing in the country they are in, but if you have international customers you need to invest in being able to communicate with them.

Screen hinge a bit stiff. When had case open to replace drive, toughed up both sides with bicycle lube. A little better; open & close slowly not to over stress the chassis. Read several reviews about screen color washed out. With HD resolution and satisfactory sharpness, there was a lot to work with. Brought it up to very nice color with the following process.

Pleased to say after installing a Samsung EVO 840 the laptop is running much better. I suspect if I even swapped in a faster HDD or Hybrid HDD the improvement would be noticeable.\n\nNot sure whom to blame here Asus for installing such a slow drive or Microsoft for releasing an OS that thrashed the disk so much?\n\nOriginal Review below:\nPrice is good but does run slow and the display is awful."}

I sent it there, the only location in the United States and that is in California. I used UPS to send it, I got the delivery receipt from UPS and the signature that it was received. It was received on September 29, 2016. I was assured when I called to get the case identity number to include with the computer, it would be in their hands 3-5 business days. I have called the service number 7 times. Each time I have been on the phone for more than 1 hour. The last 3 times I've asked to be given to a Supervisor and after significant time I am finally connected to one. They always tell me it is in the their hand for 3 - 5 days and then it is on the way back to the customer. When I spoke with them yesterday they had it in their hands for 51 days. Not a soul can tell me it is really there EXCEPT the fact I have signature that it was signed for at the service center from UPS on 9/29/16. Every brand will have problems on some units. This was an exceptionally nice laptop, but sometimes while under warranty customers need service. This company does not know the definition of service or customer satisfaction.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "So I was in the market for a 15 inch laptop since my Acer laptop went K.O for no reason. I stumbled upon this laptop and really tempted to purchase it right away, but instead I spent couple days reading all the amazon review, the good, the bad, tutorial how to upgrade the SSD and the RAM, etc.\nSo I pulled the trigger and bought this Asus laptop with the Crucial 8GB Ram, and used Samsung 850 EVO 250GB from ebay total investment about $440ish. Initial first impression without all the upgrade, the laptop is alright. Boot up was pretty slow, browsing the internet, and doing some work was ok not the fastest. The screen is alright for 1080p, I wish it wasn't matte finish. Speaker is pretty awesome on this laptop and even though this laptop is big, its actually pretty light weight. Battery was ok about 3-4 hours. The laptop looks good from a far but feels kind of cheap IMO.\nAfter I installed all the upgrades, the difference is night and day. It boot up like less than 5 seconds now, battery improved a lot, the whole performance improving significantly as well makes this laptop enjoyable to use. Now I'm not a tech savvy at all, I just followed youtube direction and fellow amazon review from here. The SSD upgrade was a little bit challenging, but you just have to be patient and don't yank anything too hard.\nShould you buy this laptop for $340 without all the upgrades? it depends on your daily usage. If you the type a person just need this laptop to do some work, youtube, Netflix, internet, I would say this laptop will do the job. If you care about performance, speed, battery (it improves a lot after the upgrade) then you should buy this laptop plus all the upgrades it's totally worth it."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "Great all around laptop for watching movies and browsing the web.  I looked at this as a great platform to enhance for less than $100 of investment and a bit of my time.\nOut of the box it boots very slowly for Windows 10 due to a super slow conventional Toshiba MQ01ABF050 500GB hard drive and only 4GB of ram.  This hamstrings an otherwise great platform.  A simple addition of a bit of ram and an SSD transform this laptop into a 2-3 second booting pleasure to live with.\n\nHere is why I'm giving this 5 stars:\nThe 4GB of hynix memory is soldered onboard so you can simply buy a small 4-8GB module and 1 screw you have the memory issues sorted: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LTV2BBK is what I used.\nThe HDD replacement is quite easy if you are tech savvy, plenty of youtube videos to explain how to do it if you are not.  Throwing in the most basic SDD drive will transform this laptop from ~20-30 seconds booting up to 2-3 seconds.  I used an old Crucial 80GB SSD I had laying around but you can find plenty for ~$40.  So for a total of ~$100 additional investment and a bit of wrenching time you get a $600 laptop for $300.\n\nI'd love to hold 1/4 of a star for the off/center keyboard due to the number pad but some folks like the number pad.  On a small laptop I'd prefer they give you an option to have a normal keyboard that is centered."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "i had this computer for almost a month and so far so good. the screen to me seems huge. applications and text seem quite small. it took me forever to figure out how to change the small text. it could be because the screen resolution is different from my last computer. i hate that the speakers are on the bottom of the computer. who puts speakers underneath a laptop??? im always propping the laptop with something to hear the sound better. The sound quality is pretty good despite there location. Everytime i tilt the screen theres a popping sound maybe something is wrong with the hinge im not for sure but it does nothing to hinder the function of the laptop. i opted to upgrade the ram to 8gb. I see a slight change in how fast it works but not much. before upgrading I installed and played the sims and autocad and it worked fine and wasn't sluggish or slow. the keyboard is a chiclet style, meaning there is a small space between each key. it seems to stay pretty cool when using it. The screen is a matte screen so theres no reflection, which i actually quite like. The Battery life is around 4-5 hours. The power key and the escape key are right on top of one another and that can be a problem sometimes. i also don't like that i have to use the fn key to get the function keys to work. overall its a good run of the mill computer. i haven't had any serious issues so far."}

Have to watch carefully for every key press, and in subdued light very difficult to see.  I had to add a paper strip along the top to identify the special keys (speaker volume, Prt Scrn etc) more clearly.\n3) Track Pad.  I should have researched Asus computers before buying - now realize this is their great Achilles Heel - very troublesome, over sensitive, have to disable all the 'multifinger swipe functions' and still the cursor can bounce around the screen.\n4) 'Mouse buttons' (in touchpad) VERY 'clicky' (noisy) - gets annoying playing a game sitting next to someone (and even to myself).  They are also very spaced apart, hard to reach right-click while holding down ctrl key for example.\n5) USB ports seem 'iffy' - had to jiggle my memory sticks around sometimes to get connected, (didn't have that in my Dell).\n6) Win 10 is a pain in many ways. I know this isn't an Asus fault but the combination was enough for me to decide to return it within 30 days (pain-free, thanks Amazon!) and go back to my old Dell D820 with WinXP and Win7!!"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "Overall, it's a good deal for a basic laptop and does exactly what I ordered it to do.\n\nPros:\n1) Screen resolution is great, which makes it possible to use the Window10 split-screen functionality and still read small text.\n2) Despite the larger size, it's surprisingly light.\n3) There are plenty of ports for connecting just about anything you'd want (HDMI, USB, another monitor).\n4) Personally, I like that the trackpad buttons are flush with the palm rest (which does, at it advertises, keep cool).\n5) The battery life is pretty decent, and charges relatively quickly.\n\nCons:\n1) The hard drive (5400rpm) and processor are definitely on the slow side; they're good for general internet use, using office products and what I've purchased it for - running and programming in Eclipse. It's definitely not capable of some of the more resource-intense programs that I use (Adobe Creative Suite products, for example) but that's fine because I knew that prior to purchasing.\n2) The keyboard area has a lot of bubble/flex in it - it doesn't really affect performance but it's definitely not solid when typing.\n3) When you close the laptop, the keyboard does make some slight imprints on the screen - I've only had it for a week, so at this point I can't determine whether this would pose an actual issue (you can see these prints when the screen brightness is turned down/off)."}

I tried looking for newer drivers for the wifi card but there are none. I also tried seeing if I can google a common adjustment or repair but could not find any as well. I got to say that I am very dissappointed with asus, my previous 3 year laptop was an asus but I can't say that will be the case for my next laptop purchase. My previous laptop was in the same budget price range of $300 and I had no wifi speed issues with it what so ever. You would think that the same standard would be upheld or slightly surpassed after 3 years, but that did not happen with this asus laptop. And just to put it out there, the internet speed on my phone, tv and laptop are still running fast like they always have.

I've never been able to figure out why it does this. It's not updating software when it does it, it just starts shutting down. When you turn it back on, nothing is lost. It's just super annoying. 2) The mouse pad is too sensitive. When I'm using my left hand to click and my right hand to scroll. Oftentimes, I click on something unintentional because the cursor will move when my right hand moves, even though my right hand is not actually touching the pad. It senses my movement if I'm just near the pad. 3) This is not another annoyance, but just another point to make. I had to replace the charger after appx 6 months of use.

Tried some solutions, none worked. I then read something about maybe bluetooth or \"location\" having something to do with it. I changed the location from off to on and back, didn't help. I tried disabling bluetooth and immediately speedtest jumped up. So I thought I figured out the problem. But the probelm arose again a few minutes later when I was watching youtube.

What makes the purchase such a regret is so how terribly piss poor their customer service is. The time on hold, what they recommend to troubleshoot, and ultimately sending the computer back for repair was remarkably frustrating, timely, and expensive\n\nThey're not going to pay for shipping so you're out at least $60 bucks - so yes, repairs even under warranty will cost you.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "**1 day of use***\n\nHaving owned several laptops and desktops, here is what I think of this computer so far: it's good, not great. There are some hollow places, like under the keys, that make it seem cheap--in my mind, at least. The weight is spread so far out and I know they're trying to make it seem lighter than it is, which works with small things like phones and tablets, but not so much with laptops. I feel like I'm holding this gigantic empty shell of a computer and it's weird.\n\nI do plan to play a few games on this--Sims 4, Neverwinter (maybe), Witcher 3, etc. I do expect a few issues with MMORPGs obviously but I'm going to try it anyway.\n\nPROS\n1. Fast: I spent all of yesterday downloading applications--Origin, Sims 4 game and expansions, Arc, and Photoshop are the big ones--and could still browse the web or do whatever. I haven't upgraded the RAM yet so I was pleasantly surprised that it could manage so much with only 4GB. Played the Sims and ran a Mud at the same time without any issue. I haven't actually used Photoshop yet but when I do, I'll update this review if I run into any problems.\n\n2. Matte screen: A minor pro. I just prefer matte to glossy.\n\n3. Lack of bloatware: I was pleasantly surprised with the number of pre-installed apps on this computer. Almost all memory was free when I booted up the first time. The few games and apps that were already on the computer were uninstalled with a few clicks and that was it.\n\nCONS\n1. Touchpad: Two-finger scrolling is my favorite way to scroll, but it's hard to do on this computer. The touchpad is too far to the left (I'm righthanded; if I was lefthanded I'd be happy) and scrolling is way too inconsistent. It will decide to jump across the screen and click on something when I'm just trying to scroll down a page and I feel like I'm assaulting the touchpad because it takes so much pressure. There has to be a way to change this but if there is, it's not under the \"Mouse & Touchpad\" section of Settings.\n\n2. Size: It's really not fair for me to put this under cons because I knew what I was getting into, but there's just something awkward about this computer. It seems like it should be about an inch or two smaller; there's a disconnect between size and weight that bothers me.\n\n3. No lights: It's impossible to tell if you have CAPS LOCK on because there is no indicator light. I have to just type and figure it out for myself. Obviously not a big deal but still annoying.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf I run into any problems or find any huge changes once the RAM is upgraded, I'll update this review. For now, I don't regret the purchase. Just hope it can handle Photoshop and Premiere Pro being run."}

I just wanted something lightweight that I could take with me to meetings and use Word, Excel and Power Point with, and view videos.  Nothing like gaming or anything elaborate.  It came loaded with Windows 10 Operating system.  The notebook is light and very cheaply made.  After an unsuccessful Windows 10 update I tried to remove the battery and restart the system.  That's when I discovered how difficult it is to just access the battery and the S/N (under the motherboard).  By doing so (I watched a YouTube video to find out how - support is non existent for ASUS) I disconnected the keyboard cable and have never been able to replace it so that the entire keyboard works.  This is such a poorly constructed notebook.  Light yes.  Crap yes.  And support ... well good luck with that.  I ended up buying a wireless keyboard and mouse rather than fight the ongoing battle with ASUS over fixing the system.  Buyer beware."}

I have had the computer for a few months now and I definitiely liked my old Toshiba better.  I don't know if I just got a \"dud\" or if all of these laptops are like this but the mouse pad is EXTREMELY sensitive.  I have gotten used to it but every time my significant other tries to use my computer he goes crazy and always says \"I don't know how you put up with this\".  It also seems a bit slow.  It takes several minutes before I can connect to the internet when I turn it on or when it wakes from sleep modes.  It also took some time to get used to the on/off key, in the beginning I often accidently hit the key when trying to hit the escape button and the computer would shut off.  Maybe they could add in an extra step to truning the computer off that asks if you are sure so you don't have to boot the whole thing back up because of a simple mistake.  Based on my experience I would probably try a different brand next time I purchase a laptop."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "Maybe I'm stretching a little by giving this laptop a five star rating, but I have my reasons:\nMy wife and I purchased this laptop for my senior citizen mom who lives with us. She's fairly tech-savvy and has been talking about wanting to get more involved online since she recently retired. First, I have a gaming PC by Asus, the verified purchase review is in my review history. I've had zero issues with my Asus. Which leads to the first good thing about this laptop ... there's no bloatware whatsoever on this laptop. Once I had set up the Windows 10 account and MS went through their \"we're getting it ready\" screens, the laptop screen opened up with only one icon on it ... the recycling bin.\n\nThis does mean there's no security software outside of Windows Defender/Security that comes with Windows 10, but I have a Webroot subscription with extra machines left on it. The closest you'll come to bloatware on this laptop is the pre-installed Office software. Unlike previous versions of Windows, it's not as easy to remove those, but in our case, I already had a multi-license use for Office 2016 and entered the product key. It's sort of a good/bad point there since I really don't know how to remove it if you don't have a key. Still, there's nothing on this laptop to pop up and say, \"Would you like to play (name) games?\" or any unknown, unheard of photo software.\n\nI tested the battery life out while setting it up. I used it for four hours and still had about 1/3rd of the battery left. I'm sure different tasks use up the battery faster, but it's a decent battery for the price of this laptop. The AC Wifi connection is very good. We have an AC router in our kitchen. Going to the far end of the house didn't show any drop in speedtests. Mom loves the Bluetooth 4.0, she has a little Bluetooth speaker in her room. It connected easily. There's two USB 3.0 ports and one USB 2.0 port. There's also an HDMI port.\n\nOne thing I especially liked about was the ease of upgrading the RAM. While I honestly believe 4 GB of RAM will be enough for her uses, I still opted to buy 8 GB more thanks to one of the answers in the questions area. I installed it in less than a minute and required no dismantling of the laptop. The build of this laptop feels of better quality than our teenage daughter's laptop, which was similarly-priced. I'll keep updating as it's used more, but I'll mainly say I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of it when considering the price. Oh and almost forgot, this does have a DVDRW/CDRW/playback disc drive as well, which is becoming increasingly hard to find on laptops. Mom wanted that to watch DVDs on. Very impressed overall."}

I'd if I just got a bad make of it, and that's what caused the problem, or if this is the case with everyone. I have just ordered extra RAM for this as well, which should definitely help. I am thinking about replacing the hard drive in this with a SSD, but I have not taken the time to try and take the laptop apart to see how difficult that task would be.\n\nHave I mentioned that this thing is beautiful? Ever since I got this I have been getting compliments about how good this laptop looks. Today, I even had a guy ask me how much I paid for it, and was surprised when I told him the price. He figured it was around the $700 range based on the look and build quality. Besides this laptop looking super nice, it's extremely slim!

I did however upgraded the memory to 12GB by just adding another 8GB. I like how it has easy access to the memory slot and not having to open the whole laptop."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "Haven't used the laptop a lot yet. Works fine but my main objection is not having software already installed on the laptop such as Windows Microsoft Word so you can start working right away. Most of the software that came with PCs and laptops in the past is missing. Also getting use to Windows 10 with the file name changes was a learning experience to begin with. Once you figure out where things are, the new format will work. Very slim laptop and nice screen and keyboard. I still use a mouse instead of the pad but that's just a personal preference. It has a CD player and plugins for extra hardware. Also has a card slot so I don't have to download from the camera which is always slower than using the card. With the large hard drive and RAM, it will have plenty of memory and speed for my use."}

When I began using it i tried watching YouTube and twitter at the same time. It crashed and said something went wrong and then blue screened.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "PROS: price\nCONS: Abysmal wifi performance\nResult: most likely going to be returning this laptop in the next few days because of very poor wifi performance.\n\nI bought this laptop to be a family computer for general purpose use. Writing letters/school papers, surfing, cat videos, light gaming. The price was right, which offset my concerns about only 4GB of ram (easily upgradable) and a slow 5400 rpm hard drive (not too difficult to upgrade).\n\nI've had it for 2 days now, and I'm very disappointed. From the start, the wifi has been unreliable and slow. Web pages taking minutes to load, if they loaded at all. I followed some recommendations found while googling (turning off bluetooth, updating the wifi driver), but results are still pretty bad. This evening, I finally did some more thorough testing.\n\n- Ethernet works great. Downloaded 2 gb of data, averaging 25-32 Mbps.\n- 5G wifi starts downloads at around 25 Mbps, but after a few seconds, drops down to 6-8 Mbps\n- 2.5G wifi is useless, starting at around 11 Mbps, but then dropping down to 0.4 Mbs\n\nDownloading the same file on my wife's laptop with 2.4G wifi is almost as fast as ethernet - 25 Mbps. All testing (wired and wifi) were done on the same router."}

Aesthetics:\n-The entire body of this laptop is plastic.\n-There is an \"anti-fingerprint/anti-smudge\" texture to the top of the lid which I find tends to trap dust.\n-The form factor is pretty slim and the entire machine is nice and light\n\n2. Function\n-This computer has a i3 2.1 GHz processor, which is fine for most computing use. However if you are a gamer or someone that codes more than just websites, find a different machine\n-There is a full 10-key pad\n-The computer utilizes the chicle style keyboard, with the key coming up through the body of the machine\n-There is a fair amount of keyboard flex due to the design of the board and the plastic body\n-The computer has on-board Intel HD 5500 graphics which will play most videos in HD without bogging down the system\n-The HS is not an SSD, although you cannot really hear it spin\n- The exhaust for the fan is in an odd location making it hard to clean. It is dead center in the gap for the monitor hinge. Personally I think the actually hinders airflow through the chassis.\n-The computer claim to have cool touch but you can feel the warmth to the right of the trackpad under heavy use.\n-The hard drive is not actually 500GB as claimed, (this is due to manufactures being allowed to market a GB as 1000MB when it is actually 1024MB meaning this system really only has about 488GB storage.)\n-There is only one user serviceable bay on the the bottom of the machine and that is to upgrade the memory, which this machine can only take 8GB\n-It has a clickable trackpad which can only be disabled via the BIOS menus, so if you want to use a mouse and not run the risk of random bumps on the trackpad you'll need to access the BIOS setting and disable the internal pointing device\n-There is a webcam for video chatting, but the quality isn't that great.\n-There are 2 USB 3 port, 1 USB 2.0\n-Ethernet port\n-Wi-Fi\n-Kensington slot (for securing your laptop with a Kensington Cable Lock)\n-SD card slot that accepts standard SD cards. A word of Warning the card does not fit fully into the slot and hangs about 2/3 the way out of the machine which could lead to damage to the card or the slot is something is dropped close to the card.\n-There is an optical drive, but honestly I have used it 2 times in the year I have owned the machine.\n\nOverall the ASUS F555LA-AB31 is a decent entry level machine. It would be great for doing homework, browsing the net, email, light gaming, social media, and sending with your child to college.\n\nIf you're an enthusiast or a power user, this is not the machine for you."}

Good for everyday use, streaming videos, playing some low requirement games like terraria, minecraft, etc. Here are some pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n- Nice and light\n- Doesn't get hot\n- Easy to upgrade ram with a compartment on the bottom with one screw. Make sure you find the correct compatible ram for this. Any DDR3L ram for laptops won't work.\n- Good battery life get around 4-5 hours using it continuously without gaming, 2-3 while gaming.\n- Full keyboard (15.6 in laptops I've seen in the past never had one unless I'm just crazy)\n\nCons:\n- Center on the keyboard is not supported very well. Don't press crazy hard on it cause it will feel like you will snap the keyboard in half.\n- Touchpad is a little bit of a pain. Doesn't respond well some of the time when clicking and dragging on the screen.\n- Dedicated vram from the processor is locked at 32 MB. Need to go into the bios on startup to set it to 512 MB. That was annoying and didn't know that without looking online.\n- 4 GB of ram but I knew it when I bought it. Cheap to upgrade to 12 GB with a 8GB stick.\n\nNon of the cons warrant a star removal just annoying but not ever laptop is perfect. Highly recommend when I got it for 350$ at the time.

I haven't even needed to add in the extra RAM I bought because the computer has been running smoothly. It's lightweight and I've noticed doesn't run hot. Love the keyboard. The screen resolution is great. I'm not a high tech computer user, so it looks great to me. I do have an issue with the text in the Google Chrome browser. The text is really small. I've tried to fix it, but nothing has worked yet. I think it's an issue with Chrome though, because I've used Mozilla and Microsoft Edge and neither of those browsers have that problem. As some of the reviews say, it doesn't have a light that indicates when CAPS lock and Num lock is enabled. A minor issue. All an all, a great buy for me. With the extra RAM, I only spent $394. A steal!"}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "I have been using the laptop since December of 2015. First, the installed bloatware isn't bad at all. You'll be able to remove most of it in Control Panel.\n\nThe keyboard is TERRIBLE. This is the most unresponsive, cheap keyboard I have ever used. In fact, I bought a wired keyboard just to make this laptop usable. Maybe I got a bad keyboard on mine, but it's required to use a wired keyboard in order to type with any speed on this laptop.\n\nTrackpad is alright. Nothing great, but not bad either. Considering the price of this laptop, it's nothing to complain about.\n\nScreen has bad viewing angles and average colors. Sure it's 1080p but looks worse than my old Macbook. Much worse. But it's okay, once again, considering this laptop goes for less than $400. Some of the pixels will go black but a reboot fixes it.\n\nThis laptop often has problems connecting to 5ghz networks. Every other computer and device I own has no issue connecting to my wifi, but this laptop often disconnects itself. I have tried multiple router brands, doesn't seem to help. No issues on 2.4ghz networks. Maybe this is just an issue with my laptop..\n\nFeels very plastic-y but that makes it lightweight and easy to hold.\n\nIt can play games like CS:GO, minecraft, garry's mod, etc. @30fps or greater on 1080p medium/high settings. Note that the laptop was elevated and had external fans cooling it. Also I am not a \"gamer\" by any means, so your results will vary. And this isn't a gaming laptop, so you shouldn't expect great results. I am mentioning just to show that it could play these games at decent settings if you wanted to do so.\n\nIn my opinion, this is a great secondary computer. I require a bit more out of my primary computer, and using this one for more than a couple of days makes me miss my mac. But if you are only browsing the web and doing homework, this is a perfect laptop. Would recommend to those looking for a budget laptop or secondary computer. Just understand it's limitations.\n\nShould you buy this over a chromebook? Maybe. If you are in college then I would stick to a Windows laptop. If you are a person who is only browsing facebook, answering emails, and watching youtube- I would suggest a chromebook. It is a much more secure operating system, but on the flip side it can't run Windows programs.\n\n[Update november 2017]\nDon't buy this in 2017 - old 5th gen intel CPU, slow hard drive, slow RAM, potato screen, cheap plastic everywhere. My battery hardly lasts 2 hours. There are many better options in the price range! 8th generation Intel CPU's will be entering laptops in early 2018! 7th gen is still a good purchase though, you probably won't find the latest and greatest in the $400 category anyways"}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "Let me preface this by saying that while I'm no IT professional, I have an above average handle over general computer maintenance and repair. Hardware is not really my thing, but if I've successfully built a desktop in the past, I shouldn't have problems doing minor hardware repairs. All of that said, this a good laptop with a few major problems.\n\nPros:\n\n-1080p screen\n-i3 processor is powerful enough to handle average use (I previously only owned i5 processors)\n-Good keyboard (Some years ago, I owned an ASUS K53E which was nearly impossible to type accurately on)\n-Solid construction (My previous laptop was a Lenovo G580, which had a very cheap build quality and which totally fell apart after some time)\n-Dual-band WiFi\n-Better-than-expected battery life (I'd say it can easily last 4 hours or longer and it charges quickly)\n-Touchpad (It's similar to the Mac trackpads that don't actually include separate buttons for left and right click)\n-Lightweight and relatively thin\n-Great price\n\nCons:\n\n-Difficult to modify/repair/replace hardware (I'll get into this later)\n-WiFi constantly loses connection (I'll get into this later)\n-Haven't had success upgrading RAM (Up to this point, I thought it was a product defect, but I now suspect that I've not had success because I've been trying to put a 1.5v chip in, and this laptop takes 1.35v)\n-Touchpad (I'll get into this later)\n-Windows 7 is not supported (This is probably not a major issue for anyone, but if you want to run Windows 7 on this laptop, you'll have to find drivers from other manufacturers because Asus does not provide them. If you know what you're doing, this shouldn't be a problem, but I'm not positive you'll find a touchpad driver)\n\nNow, onto the two largest issues:\n\nUnless you're an expert, you're going to have a tough time modifying or replacing hardware. Something as simple as replacing the hard drive with a SSD requires removing 10 screws to open the laptop. Except removing those 10 screws won't actually open the laptop because first, you'll have to remove all of the plastic clips keeping it together. For this, you'll need something like an old credit card, a lot of time, and even more patience. The first time probably took me half-an-hour. After the first time, it gets easier, but it's still not easy. Once you manage to get the laptop open and disconnect the keyboard and trackpad cables, you'll need to unscrew and remove a little board that has the card reader, headphone input, and a USB port. Finally, you can unscrew the hard drive cage and replace the HDD with an SSD.\n\nThis illustrates the problem. Users are not meant to open this laptop for any reason. The RAM that's included is soldered in. The battery is not removable (unless, perhaps, you're a pro), and in general, it is difficult to access any parts. This takes me to the next major problem I'd like to discuss: WiFi.\n\nWhen the WiFi works, it works wonderfully. Connected to the 5gz network, I typically get 125mbps DL and 20mbps UL. The problem is, the WiFi card DOESN'T always work as it should. It randomly disconnects, and I have to troubleshoot the connection to get it to work again. This can happen multiple times a day or even multiple times within an hour. I've tried installing driver updates from both Asus and other manufacturers, but none seem to fix the problem. I suspect that the card is bad, and it should be simple to replace cheaply, but I can only imagine how hard it will be to access and remove the wireless card. I may be able to do it myself, but I can't even find instructions online about how to disassemble the laptop past replacing the hard drive. I may tinker with it a bit and see what I can do, but I'm not hopeful. Given how much I rely on my laptop, I can't imagine parting with it for weeks for Asus to repair it under warranty, so I'll probably have to take it to a shop (something that someone with my IT skills shouldn't ordinarily have to do) in order to get it replaced, and I'll probably have to pay an exorbitant amount of money to do so.\n\nOne other (more minor) problem:\n\nThe included touchpad software offers no way to assign the middle mouse button click to a gesture. The previous two laptops I've owned allowed the user to assign a two-finger or three-finger tap to middle click, which I use extensively to open new browser tabs, to close tabs, and to scroll up and down webpages. Often times, even when the manufacturer's software doesn't include the options, various registry settings can be tweaked in order to allow this functionality. As far as I can tell, even that cannot be done with this laptop. The only solution I've found is a freeware program someone much more knowledgeable than myself wrote in order to rectify the problem on his own laptop. The solution basically hijacks the command that would ordinarily happen when tapping three fingers (ordinarily, it would open Cortana), and instead, sends the middle mouse button click. This software has made the computer usable, but it's got some major inconveniences. The first is that it only works about 85% of the time. At seemingly random times and frequencies, Cortana will still open up. This gets annoying pretty quickly. The other issue is that it does not work when controlling another computer using Remote Desktop Connection, which is something I do all the time. Frustrating.\n\nAnyway, it's a good computer, but if you're considering buying it, just hope that you never have to repair or replace any hardware. Otherwise, you're in deep trouble."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "I originally bought this as a light-use travel computer, as part of replacing my old clunky laptop with a high-powered desktop and a cheapo notebook for the relatively rare occasions I need to travel.  But I like it so much I don't feel the need to get the desktop.  I replaced the hard drive with an SSD and it blazes, even without a memory boost (might do that later).  This is really a necessary thing, because for some reason the hard drive gets quite hot under the palm rest.  Without that, the computer itself never does, and in fact it's virtually silent, another big plus.  Replacing the hard drive is a little nerve-wracking, but ultimately not that difficult.  The youtube video shows you how to open the case with a plastic card like a credit card.  It runs Photoshop and Google Earth just fine; the speakers sound tinny on the default settings, but tweak it just a little and even they sound decent.\n\nAnother advantage of putting in an SSD is that it seems to extend the battery life.  People have said the regular battery life is 3-5 hours, but I get 7+ hours easily.  This is my first time having a laptop with a real usable battery (all my earlier ones claimed 4-5 hours and usually got 2 hour of the box, dropping to 1.5 after a year or so), and I'm loving it.\n\nThe screen is very bright, a nice difference from most of the other cheap laptops that have very dim screens even on full brightness.  It's so bright I have to turn it down a bit so the whites don't hurt my eyes when I'm indoors!  It's also great that it has an ethernet port and CD drive, rare items on computers this small and light, let alone at this price point.  It does seem odd though that they crammed in a VGA port as the external display, instead of going with the much smaller DisplayPort or HDMI.\n\nThe one thing I have issues with is the keyboard.  I actually liked it better at first, because the keys are closer together than on all the others I tried (HP, Acer, Lenovo, Dell), so it fits better with my hands.  But for some reason I keep missing letters when I'm typing (that is, I hit the key but no letter shows up).  I think it's due to not hitting straight down or with enough force, as I'm not used to using any of these chiclet-style keyboards (even my previous laptop had a long-travel keyboard).  It's not super strongly built - you can't expect that for under $350 - but it only flexes a little in the keyboard and on the bottom near the CD drive door, otherwise it's fairly solid.\n\nAll things considered, the cons are pretty minor.  This is a great computer!"}

The hdmi, vga, disk drive, and ethernet port are a real plus and make it extra functional. Build quality is what you'd expect for an inexpensive laptop -- hinges aren't the smoothest and the keyboard's got some bounce but what do you expect for 300ish bucks. Very happy so far.\n\nEdit: Just wanted to note that I used this laptop for a while before making the upgrades and it was still a decent unit for the price. Not the fastest, especially if you're used to fast computers, but still very functional.

In general this laptop is pretty good;  you get a lot for the money, including a webcam, a CD\\DVD drive, and excellent speakers.  There are a couple of things I'm not crazy about: 1)  the monitor color is muted.  No matter what I do, I can't get the vivid colors I got from my last computer, and 2) the keyboard has a cheap feel to it.  The number pad is especially bad; the whole area \"sinks\" when you press on one number.  There are other issues that are more related to Windows 10 and I can't blame Asus for these problems.  I would certainly recommend this computer as a lower end option for someone who is going to use Microsoft Office, stream music, and surf the Internet.  It might not have enough power for intense game play.  Not bad at all."}

I'm an IT guy, this is what I do for a living.  And the first thing I did was yank the 5400RPM garbage drive out of it and slap in a Samsung 850 EVO 500gb SSD and install Windows 10 fresh.  RAM at 4gb is a little light for the use case I have in mind, so I'll likely get another 4gb module for it, but even before that the unit cranks up in 4 seconds and everything launches at a click.  Disassembly is rather easy for a laptop, if a bit odd having to remove a daughter board to get the hard disk out.  All in all, for the price this thing cannot be beat."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "This is an okay computer. I bought it because of the screen. I'm a grad-student and spend a lot of time writing, and watching youtube videos when I should be writing, so I have come to appreciate crisp resolution. The Full HD resolution on this Asus hits the spot. The 1080p is noticeable right off the bat (not only because all of the icons and print are smaller), and I have not had any eye pains or headaches like I used to get after a couple hours on my 2013 Toshiba satellite. However the viewing angles are far worse compared to my old laptop, and the screen brightness is kind of a bummer. For example I'm in a naturally lit room on full brightness and the background whites still have a bluish hue. Also the bezel is huge, especially at the top, making this the biggest, albeit lightest 15.6 laptop I've ever had. (I always get 15.6 inch screens because I like having two tabs open on either side of the screen, unfortunately the screen is not as wide as my last computer, and the dual windows are a little narrow for my liking).\nThe computer is also a little sluggish for what I was expecting, definitely slower than my last computer when it was fresh out of the box. They have the same specs, both 4gb of ram, Intel core 3 (of course the Toshiba was 3rd gen I believe), and a big ol' harddrive. Maybe it's windows 10 that requires more ram, slowing this Asus down, or maybe it was the Geek Squad that tuned my old computer up just right...I don't know, but my 2013 toshiba was faster (before the windows 10 upgrade).\nThe keyboard also leaves something to be desired. The keys are squeky and the keyboard is the only part of the computer that really feels cheap. There is no capslock light anywhere on the keyboard, and there is no way to lock the function keys. Finally, the keyboard appears cramped with an unused 3/4\" space on both sides.\nThe track pad works fine for a trackpad, it is big, but manages to stay out of the way while typing.\nThe battery lasts about 4-5 hours of average work. I figure this will decrease with time, but  I don't move around too much so it's no problem.\nAll in all, if you need to have a 15.6 inch computer and are tired of staring at 720p this is the way to go. If you don't spend a lot of time on your computer, however, you might want to look into getting more ram or an SSD to speed things up. I heard asus motherboards are the best around, but this laptop just lacks spunk.\nI'm moving in a couple weeks and will be taking the ram out of my old computer to put in here, from what I've read that gives this computer the edge it needs. I may look into the SSD later on as well.\nPros:\n1080p Full Hd Screen\nIntel Core 3\n\nCons:\nSpeakers are subpar, even for a budget computer\nkeyboard is cheap\nbezels are huge\nscreen brightness is lacking\nno funciton lock (have to push two buttons to change volumes)"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "It's a pretty darn good laptop for the money.\n\nBuild quality is pretty good. Doesn't feel overly flimsy or weak at any point. Keyboard is responsive as well, and the touchpad is decent enough.\n\nThe screen, which is probably why most of you are looking at this laptop.... well, it IS a 1080p screen. You can't really find a laptop in this pricepoint that had a 1080p screen, so good on Asus for making this affordable.\n\nWhy do I sound hesitant? It's a 1080p screen, but it's a TN panel. And a very, very bad TN panel at that. Any amount of angle to your viewing and blacks become so washed out they're basically white. Contrast is also quite horrible viewing from the front as well. I've tried attempting to fix it by calibrating the display but it doesn't seem to be fixable, rather just inherent to the lower quality display.\n\nOther than the screen problems, it's a solid buy. It is a little difficult to get apart to change out the hard drive (get an SSD for this, it makes it 100% faster. They're using a 5400 RPM hard disk in this so it's slow.)\n\nThere are videos out there detailing how to take similar models apart, so just follow those if you want."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "Nice laptop for the price. Seems to perform well during the short time in use.\nHOWEVER, after about 8 hours of use and after getting most of Win10 set up and applications loaded, the screen colors went bad. Everything had a very greenish tint. Contacted ASUS support and received very good response - quick confirmation of the problem and issuance of a RMA for repair including a shipping label via FedEx Ground. Repair time was stated as being a three day turn-around after receipt. This was accomplished and about a week later the laptop was returned with a note of LCD replacement. Turned it on and was very disappointed to see that the problem had NOT been corrected. The software configuration was untouched so that was a plus. Another call to the support folks. First time call got routed to never-land, return call was good. Once again a RMA was issued but I had to specifically ask for a return shipping label (rep said they usually only supply one for the first incident - does that mean if it fails again during the one year warranty they expect you to cover the shipping?) They did cover it this time since it was a repeat problem. Received the laptop back a week later. Only note was that there was an \"error message\". Looks like whatever was done fixed the problem this time. This time the hard disk had apparently been replaced because all my Win10 setup and applications/data were gone. So a good couple of weeks of unavailability and redo. Hopefully that was an isolated incident.\n\nHave noted that when using the system for presentations using an external large screen TV monitor the colors are somewhat over-saturated. I have not been able to immediately resolve this but it might be better with a bit of tweaking. Need more experimenting time with this.\n\nAnother minor issue is that there is no keyboard or status light(s) to indicate when Caps Lock or Num Lock is turned on. All that would take is a small LED embedded in the key(s)."}

I spent a lot of time saving and researching before deciding on the F Series Asus laptop. And, overall it has lived up to my expectations. It is a great size for watching video/movies on and the DVD drive is a definite plus with great playback. The sound is decent & crisp, but if there is a lot of background noise, I prefer using my headphones for better volume. I got mine with Windows 10. Took me a bit of getting used to, but overall I like it. I did end up creating folders on my desktop for my photos and videos as it was taking forever to try and arrange them on this set up. And, I am a bit bummed that I can't save to my One Drive cloud without having it take up space on my laptop as well, but there are plenty of other cloud services, so this wasn't too big of an issue for me. I am a multi-tasker and often running 3 - 5 windows at a time including video and have been very please with how well the laptop keeps up with me. The speed is great until the battery gets low. Once you are just above 10%, it slows down dramatically and at 7%...well...it's not really 7%, it is time to plug in. lol But, I can do my multi-tasking and still get a good 3 - 4 hours on the battery. When I first got it, the built in mousepad and keyboard were the one thing I didn't care for. The mousepad takes up nearly half of the space and was a bit sensitive. However, you can adjust how the mousepad works or even have it disabled when using a wired/wireless mouse. I have adjusted to the set up now and barely notice. So, are there some little things that may bother people? Sure. But, what you get for the asking price on this is amazing and I am so happy with this purchase and look forward to using this laptop for a good long time."}

Keyboard design causes trouble finding some keys when typing:  By squeezing a separate number pad in on the right, the keyboard squishes 4 stand alone arrow keys in under the RETURN key, thus shifting the SHIFT and CNTL keys left towards middle.  And 4 of the number pad keys also have arrow keys ...?  not sure why two sets.  Also have trouble mastering the sensitivity of the touchpad.  No issues with chip performance, but I avoid using it and my wife uses a usb connected keyboard and mouse, defeating the purpose.  I have been using laptops regularly since 1997 for work and home."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "I cannot believe how great this notebook is for $339!!!  My old HP notebook was dying and over the last few months I had spent hours reviewing other placements at budget prices as that is all I can afford.  However, nothing really seemed to fit the bill.  Then the HP notebook took another nosedive so one night, I just took to Amazon and this was the first notebook to appear.  I quickly read a couple of reviews, saw the number of stars and reviewers and just ordered it before I changed my mind.  Afterwards, I was concerned about having buyers' remorse (as I did with the HP), but I'd been looking for a while.  In the morning, I spent more time looking at reviews for this and nobody but the persnickety were saying anything bad.\n\nIt has arrived and I am delighted with it.  I cannot believe I got this for $339.  The mouse track is great, very much like Apple's, the display is phenomenal (full HD), I do see what one reviewer said about the keyboard being a little bouncy (I can live with that esp. after HP which had a keyboard that jumped on the screen on you), love the DVD read/write, HDMI port, and speakers.  Again, can't believe what I've got for $339.  I am upgrading the RAM (no brainer) and will replace the hard drive with an SSD when the warranty runs out as that performance improvement is noticeable even by someone like me who is not measuring performance by the nanoseconds.  Now I hope this computer can go the distance (i.e. everything still works at the end of 2 years)."}

I spend quite a bit of time using Microsoft Office, Quickbooks, Blackboard, grading papers, writing papers, performing internet research, creating lecture videos, posting content, and communicating with overseas clients on video conferencing and webinars.  I usually have ALL of these programs open at one time.  This computer is more than enough for any and all of those tasks.  I also watch TV on the computer and training videos, from time to time.  If you are a gamer, perform high-end design or graphic functions, or require large amounts of operating memory to get through your day, this computer may NOT be for you.  All I can say, is that I work it hard all day, everyday, and it is terrific.\n\nI also owned its predecessor of the same model and I will admit that the construction is quite a bit \"cheaper\" feeling than the one I bought before.  My original unit was more sturdy and of significant weight.  This unit is much lighter, but also uses cheaper materials in construction.  Well, listen, if you want a cheaper/lighter unit, then you have to expect cheaper/lighter materials.  My old unit is still going strong after 4 years.  This unit stays at my office and is my primary computer while I am there!  I am also thinking about replacing my employee's computers with this laptop, as well.\n\nKnow thyself and check the specifications to match them with your usage patterns and you should be fine purchasing this unit!"}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "As was noted in other reviews, this laptop lives up to its low price and not much more. The keyboard, especially, feels thin and plasticky, as well as the surrounding area. Yes, I know it's plastic, but it feels cheap and hollow to the touch. Also, the keys themselves seem larger than most other boards I've used - larger means the keys are also farther apart which, if you're used to typing fast, is a bit of a learning curve adjustment.\n\nThe one other negative observation is that the touch pad is, well, not great. They've made a decent effort to match the touch and gestures in Mac products, but it's just not there yet. For instance, when sliding two fingers up or down (to scroll), the monitor image often expands as if I were spreading my fingers diagonally to accomplish that task. I've tried it every which-way with my fingers, but it still happens. I'm hoping to find some settings adjustments to stop this from happening, as it's very annoying. The outer plastic has a rather odd radial texture to it. Again, feels cheap and hollow. Monitor screen is nice; the computer itself is fast enough. (I did add 8GB of memory to it, though.)\n\nI do feel it's worth the price. Since I'm intending to use it only for the rare Windows task (I've now converted completely over to Apple/Mac) it should fill my needs adequately."}

The laptop is about $47.00 cheaper than the Acer I had previously and so far I'm impressed. I really like that fact that it's very quiet, and runs very cool. After using it for a couple hours I was able to power it off and put it in my case. I was never able to do that before since the Acer was very warm after using it even for a short time. I have a blue tooth Logitech mouse that looks like it was made for this laptop and I can use the same case as my Acer so I just saved even more money. It runs very well and I have had no issues so far but I only just received this yesterday but so far, so good. It works and I'm happy so I'll see how it operates over the next couple weeks. And of course I received this in about 1 1/2 days since I ordered it Friday night and got it Sunday morning.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "While not perfect, this is still one of my favorite machines. The only reason I haven't given it five stars is that the touchpad is a little \"floaty\"-feeling, and the case feels a little cheap, though it's actually surprisingly sturdy. There's also a bit of keyboard bounce, though nothing seriously annoying.\n\nNow, the good parts: the Broadwell Core i3-5010U CPU is amazingly zippy for something that's sold as middle of the road at best, and very efficient. It doesn't turbo, but its base clock is plenty and it does more in its 15-watt TDP than equivalently-clocked Sandybridge and Ivybridge (i3-2xxxM and 3xxxM) CPUs do in 35W, not to mention its graphics are better. Intel's really nailed its process architecture; Broadwell may only be a 14nm Haswell shrink, but it does everything right.\n\nThe screen. Ohhhhh mercy, the screen. Full HD at this price point is unheard of. Yes, it's a TN panel with narrow viewing angles, it's a bit pale and washed-out, and it doesn't have very high contrast. But it's good enough, and the difference 1920x1080 makes over 1366x768 is like night and day. Asus deserves major, major praise for this and I hope they continue the trend of putting better-than-1366 panels in budget models. The screen is my main draw to this model, and the main reason I recommend it to clients and customers.\n\nThe keyboard is a bit better than expected at this price point. For a budget machine, it feels good, if a little bit unstable. There's some flex if you hit the keys hard like I do; it's not a Thinkpad. But it's good enough even for long typing sessions, and Asus is the only company that still makes more or less full-height arrow keys. The touchpad, again, feels a bit floaty and spacey, but nothing majorly wrong.\n\nMaintenance: thre's no maintenance hatch, which is becoming more and more common these days, sadly. Luckily, it's not *too* horribly difficult to maintain: undo all the bottom panel screws and carefully prise the panel up with a spudger or other thin plastic tool. Don't yank it up; the keyboard is ribbon-cable'd to the bottom and needs to be released. Once done, you can access the hard drive bay easily. I *highly* recommend replacing the HDD with an SSD, which is what I do for all my customers; this machine absolutely screams with an SSD.\n\nOS: Windows is Windows. My opinions on Windows are not printable in polite company, so I will leave it at that, with a side note commending Asus for keeping its bloatware levels down, especially compared to HP and Lenovo. This machine also takes Linux like a champ, and I have had success running Arch with XFCE and some heavy tweaks to make it look like a Mac. This is where the FHD screen shines; combine this machine with an SSD and Linux, and you can make something massively faster and more pleasant to use than the price would seem to indicate.\n\nOverall, this is an excellent machine with a few flaws that are entirely forgivable at this price. It's an extremely well-balanced package and offers amazing value for the money, plus if you know what you're doing you can get the kind of experience that normally costs twice as much out of it. Bravo, Asus; this is yet another reason you're my favorite!"}

I paid an additional $25 for an 8GM memory chip to upgrade memory from 4GB to 12GB.\n\nNeutral\n* The laptop includes features expected for this price range: 500GB hard drive, 5th generation Intel I3 processor, 4GM memory, DVD player, 80211c WIFI.\n\nMinuses\n* Screen is not easily readable at an angle.  So two people watching a movie should be friends and three would soooooo need to be budsies.\n\nOverall\n* Excellent buy at this price point.  It is a smart choice for most of what most people want to do most of the time on a laptop.\n\nSubjective Remarks\n* I purchased this laptop for my son who is about to begin as a college freshman.  I anticipate that it will serve him well thru college.\n* I like the feel of this keyboard better than the keyboard feel of my own Dell laptop.\n* Color is silver on black.  Black on black is more common and I prefer that, but only slightly, and you may see it differently."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "I had assumed this would be a decent laptop for regular desktop work, web browsing, and some minimal gaming. But for such a seemingly simple premise, it certainly had its issues.\n\nThe start up time for windows ever so slightely became longer each time, and while I do not know if it was due to software or hardware, I did my best to keep everything protected and up to date. I can say for sure that this computer has a decent amount of \"bloatware\" from asus that you may wish to uninstall.\n\nThe intel video card is unimpressive evem for a budget laptop, and struggles to play low intensity games; for example I played Age of Decadence on mostly low settings/resolution in order to have an acceptable fps. The onboard sound card also had problems, especially when multiple sounds had to be processed and played at the same time.\n\nThe grande finale of this laptop's short lifespan was the hard disk, which did not seat well and consistently ran at nearly 100% capacity until it broke entirely. This happened in the span of 3-5 days, and I had the computer for only three months total. Some say this is a windows 10 issue, and while i did try a whole array of fixes to prevent it, I could say its a combination of driver issues specific to this computer and windows 10.\n\nYes, this is a longwinded two star review, but all in all I really do wish for you to at least spend an extra hundred dollars or two on a more mainstream brand with a decent graphics processor. Or if you're looking for pure web browsing and word processing, spend your money on a netbook or some such. This Asus tries to straddle the awkward line of mainstream laptops and budget notebooks and ends up doing nothing well."}

Window's boots up so fast i wonder if it really even shuts off. Web browsing, videos even 1080 runs smooth and the laptop remains quiet.\n\nMy huge problem is how the colors are on the monitor. from first boot I knew it wasn't good. while looking at text and most webpages everything looks okay, once I started looking at photos the problem stood out immediately. I'd like to start to say i'm not some perfectionist who needs perfect crystal coloring, but no other TV, Laptop, or monitor has ever looked this bad in my life. Everything was cool and cold, and pictures all looked like the contrast was turned down, washing the colors away giving everything a sickly grey look. Turning up the contrast didn't help as saturaded hues become more so giving an \"Instagram filter\" like look to the photo. My only fix was slightly brightening up the Red hue to give everything a warmer tone, but even that doesn't bring it up to the basic standards of what i'm use to.\n\nFor the price and what I use it for I'll deal with it, but I'm a little disappointed in it."}

That's to be expected and I reluctantly accepted that since this was to be no more than a backup laptop that I could take home and do some light work. Also consider the low price point, what can you expect for $329? But what got me is the large amount of bloatware that ASUS loaded onto this puppy. I have nothing good to say about ASUS Live Update, what is that anyway?  And then the coup de grace: I purchased this laptop in Sept 2015, it died mid-June 2016.  9 whole months of s-l-o-w computing.

It is difficult to even type a whole sentence without something triggering the tab key or whatever it may be. I have disabled the touch pad so it cannot be that either.

The keyboard has a fairly cheap plastic feeling, and bends/deforms under the pressure of light typing. The trackpad is pretty glitchy - sometimes I can scroll with two fingers, sometimes I can't - and also feels cheap, with the buttons sometimes sticking when clicking.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "This machine can be used in more ways than just \"simple everyday applications\" the companies advertise this computer to do. I'm a gamer, and I wanted to run a selection of games on this laptop. Of course, I know that this machine could not run the latest and greatest games, or even the games before that. I have a gaming rig for that, but I needed this laptop to play more casual games. I'll list a few of the games I've tested. Note that I've upgraded the RAM to 8 gb because 4 will just not cut it these days. I have also upped the dedicated video RAM to 512 mb in the BIOS.\n\nPortal/TeamFortress2/Garry'sMod - This laptop will run any source game very fluently on high settings with anti aliasing turned off. Resolution can be turned down to 1600x900 for better performance.\n\nCounter Strike: Global Offensive - Again, game runs nicely on medium/high settings. Again, playing on 1600x900 resolution.\n\nWarframe - Has a bit of trouble with this game. 30-50 fps with low settings and at 1368x768 resolution with most settings turned off.\n\nMinecraft - Runs a clean 40-60 on high settings, although render distance has been turned down a bit to avoid studdering from loading chunks.\n\nTerraria - Runs perfect 60+ fps on 1920x1080 on highest settings.\n\nLeague of Legends - Runs 80 fps on medium/high settings at 1920x1080. Very fluent.\n\nThose are some of the games I tested and played around with. Overall this laptop is a great buy, good design, great price, great screen, and decent performance. The only gripe I have with this machine is the display colors, which slightly muddles up gloomy and dark colors, while bright and vibrant colors are saturated."}

I haven't noticed any lag, but I've mostly used the internet, Skype, and a few games on Steam so far. Windows 10 can take some getting used to.. It's a sturdy seeming thing, not too heavy. Surprisingly big laptop, even though I knew it would be 15\".. Doesn't slow down for my games yet, seems to be fairly durable.\n\nI'll be dual booting in a week or two, so I'll update sometime after about Linux performance and programming. For now, here's the first glance:\n\nHardware:\n- keyboard: all of the keys tilted ever so slightly to the right, not a big deal; small keys in height, easy to type on; nice clicking per touch, if you like that.\n- screen: nice and big, good graphics resolution.\n- mouse: good clicking, both right and left click capable; double tap to click as well, which is good to save it from wearing down.\n- case: plastic, but good texture, seems professional\n- Camera: a bit pixelly, tbh. Don't expect very much.\n- Microphone: quiet. Very quiet. People have the volume up high on Skype with me to hear me. Also lots of static. Well, unless you talk really loudly anyhow.\n- NOT A TOUCHSCREEN. so don't expect it. fyi\nTwo really good things: it hasn't yet gotten really hot (yay!) and the battery life is like 6 hours so long as you're not doing heavy duty stuff (and you may say \"just internet\" but if you use Chrome, it just ticks away with your CPU and power... I've tested Firefox and Chrome with battery life, both are good).\n\nSoftware:\n- Windows 10, can be a pro or con.. runs quickly so far.\nI can talk about Linux after installing and playing.\n\nOverall:\n-Really, really good for the price. :D\n- Not the best camera or mic but those who care too much will buy external ones.\n- Good speed. battery life, cooling.\n- Looks pricier than it actually is - good if you want to sneak and impress people haha!\n- I personally like the feel of it."}

I purchased it to be a portable workhorse for mostly professional use (I'm a university prof). I've had it about a week and it has exceeded my expectations.\nPROS:\nWide HD screen at a really decent price\nNumeric keypad is a godsend for folks like me who use spreadsheets every day\nEasily expanded it to 12GB of RAM (many thanks to the awesome reviewers who recommended this and even posted videos about how to do it)\nWith the extra RAM, the laptop effortlessly handles intense data analysis (I run multivariate stats and permutation-based analyses that require RAM). It also handles big files in Illustrator well. In this regard the laptop has exceeded my expectations.\nWifi DL rates are super\nRuns very cool\nLightweight, portable\n3 USB, 1 SD, VGA and HDMI outputs\nArrived with absolutely zero bloat. Clean slate. Fantastic\nOverall, surprisingly high end features for a laptop at this price point.\n\nCONS (none of which I consider major)\nVideo card simply cannot handle intensive work- for example, it can't handle the live feed from the 10MP microscope camera in my lab, not even close. I haven't even bothered to try gaming on it. To be clear: at this price point, I was expecting this. Just putting this here so potential buyers are fully aware.\nThe keyboard that comes with this chassis is a bit weird- the keys are densely packed and are quite high off the keyboard, so I find myself often hitting the wrong keys- many typos. But I'm getting used to it. The only key placement I can't really get past is that the right arrow key is displaced to the right and sandwiched between the 1 and 0 on the numerical keypad, which means I am constantly deleting 1's and 0's when editing documents. The arrow keys also feel very small (maybe my fingers are too fat?).\nThe laptop is light, but this translates to a build that feels somewhat flimsy- the screen flexes alarmingly unless you open/close it by pressing/lifting it from exactly in the middle, for example. I wouldn't put this chassis through the same take-it-anywhere hell I put my ASUS N81, which was bulletproof.\n\nAll in all, I am very satisfied with this product after a week or so of intensive use."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "After much research, I purchased this as a replacement to my Dell Inspiron 1525 which had Vista.  My Dell actually worked great until about a year ago, and then Windows 10 came out and Microsoft didn't offer automatic update for Vista.  Then my Dell really started having issues, but it was at least 7 years old by then.  We have always purchased Dell and my 'research' disclosed that both Dell and Asus were the top brands for laptops for 2016, and that was confirmed by a few people I spoke with.  This laptop had good reviews and the price seemed right.  Set-up was easy, including connection to our Wi-Fi, setting up my email, photo transfer, everything.  I have not had one issue with it.  The keyboard has the number pad (right side) which my Dell did not, so that's a plus.  Typing is easy, key response is excellent as is the touch pad; however, I have never adjusted to using a touch pad so use a mouse most often.  The keyboard panel is larger than my Dell and I have small hands so that is an adjustment.  My ONLY complaint is that it only has one USB 2.0 port and most of my flash drives and devices (including my mouse) use that port.

Its the same thing if you plug in headphones or external speakers. Those same speakers that played at a good volume and quality sound when used with another laptop, when used with this laptop simply had no power at all. And its not just the volume, the speakers seem to be capable of protruding treble alone. Not only will never get even a hint of bass, its incapable of playing the mid-rage either.

After looking around and realizing I really didn't need that much (today's PCs have more power than most normal tasks really ever use and this one is no exception) I settled on the Asus F555L from Amazon. As always it arrived promptly in in great condition. I know from experience that 4 GB of RAM is a bit anemic for me (but probably fine for most light tasks like web browsing, email, office tasks, etc.) so I picked-up an 8 GB memory module at the same time. Installing the memory was a breeze and only required the removal of one screw (and a sticker over that screw). Anyone with basic mechanical aptitude shoul dbe able to upgrade the RAM in this laptop.\n\nI had every intention of replacing the hard disk with an SSD but I have yet to do so. Honestly I barely notice the slower spindle-based disk though I will get around to doing this one day in the future--it just hasn't been that important to me yet. Unfortunately replacing the hard disk is not as easy as adding RAM and while it doesn't seem too difficult I wouldn't proceed if this is the first time you've ever attempted such a feat. It's certainly doable for a beginner with moderate technical aptitude but will require the removal of around 10+ screws and unplugging (and re-seating) a small ribbon cable inside the guts of the machine. There are videos on YouTube that show this process and I Recommend watching one of these before attempting the upgrade regardless of skill level.\n\nIt's been over a month since I acquired the laptop and I use it everyday. It has easily been able to handle 4 small VMs running under Oracle's Virtualbox with not performance degradation noticed.\n\nI'm very happy with the purchase and would gladly recommend this to anyone seeking a budget-friendly but still competent laptop. I do recommend the memory upgrade as the module is only around $30 and takes less than 5 minutes to install. Odds are the memory, while not strictly needed, will be required at some point and should help extend the happiness factor of this purchase over the longer term.

I especially like being able to use either the LAN port or the WIFI option. It's sturdy, (I've already flown with it). For basic computing no matter where you are, I highly recommend this laptop."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "It is an okay laptop for the price. It has its quirks. The mouse touchpad is okay for the most part. You need to make sure you are hitting the \"clicker\" all the way to the left or the right, if you hit it any where towards the middle it just assumes you are right clicking. Not sure if it is just specific to this laptop or an Asus thing in general but it is annoying that it is setup as a 2 finger scroll. You can't change it to one finger. You also can't turn off the 3 finger gestures which is a pain especially seeing as you have to use 2 to scroll, its very easy to acidentally hit it with 3 fingers. I am sure there is a way to switch drivers but I don't trust my computer skills enough to switch. The screen often dims on its own while watching videos. It does not do this all the time just when it feels like it. I have checked, adaptive brightness is turned off so not really sure why it does this. Quirks"}

First, they put the headphone jack near the USB port and when I was putting in my headphones without being careful I shoved it into the USB port which caused my laptop to shut off. Thankfully, there was no lasting damage (so far), but I read online that you can actually kill your laptop by accidentally plugging your headphones into your USB port! They could've put the USB port and headphone jack in a better spot. Also, the headphone jack is kind of touchy. I've had it disconnect on me a few times just picking my laptop up or moving it to a new spot. Other than these minor issues, this laptop is quite a good laptop for those on a budget who just want to do everyday things on it."}

For me the text size in the Windows settings was set at 125% by default, so if text seems abnormally large or blurry, check that setting.\nDecent build quality, with no major faults.\n\nThere are only a few minor annoyances-\nComes bundled with ASUS bloatware, but is easily removed.\nIf you ever fiddle with the keyboard keys like I do, they can be hard to put back in place if taken out.\n\nThis is the best in its price range, but of course this price range will not give you the best quality hardware. Its 5400 RPM hard drive and 4 gigabytes of RAM will bottleneck the system, but the hard drive can be replaced with a much faster SSD and there is a slot for adding RAM."}

Also, at least for me, shipping is great. All of my products have come about a day early of when they say. If there was one store on Earth, I would hope it would be Amazon!!\n\nNow, back to the laptop. This machine is very fast. The 4GB RAM lets it loads pages very quickly if you're surfing the internet of if you're doing homework. I've had this for a few months now, and it hasn't failed me once yet! The 500GB storage is helpful for storing a file of any size.\n\nThe webcam on this performs exceptionally well, as does the sound system. Gaming works well on this, though I haven't tried very many.\n\nWindows 10 is very easy to get used to. I can navigate it easily, and the laptop boots up in less than a minute, so I can get on it quickly.\n\nWhen opening it from delivery, you will have to charge it for 3 hours before use. The battery can last up to about 8 hours if you're just surfing the internet. This laptop does not heat up at all and the fan is barely audible. It does have a disc drive, a webcam, and three USB ports (2 third generations and 1 second generation). It comes with a charger and battery, though the battery is hard to remove (I don't see why anyone would want to though). The one and only downside is that the keyboard does not light up for night use.\n\nThis laptop is an amazing score for me and I hope to use it for years to come. PLEASE BUY!!!!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "I just purchased this laptop from Amazon Fulfillment center.  I absolutely love this laptop.  Like many others have stated on here, you can't beat the price of this laptop for a Full HD screen.  I am into technology and I even got the Dell laptop from Best Buy for $299.99 on sale but it has a 1366 x 768 screen resolution.  The 1920 x 1080 is way better and the way to go.  You can't beat the price of this laptop to get full HD.  I also upgraded the RAM to 12GB.  The RAM I chose was http://www.amazon.com/Crucial-PC3-12800-204-Pin-Notebook-CT102464BF160B/dp/B006YG8X9Y?ie=UTF8&psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00.  It is very easy to install this RAM.  There is a slot on the bottom of the laptop.  It has a sticker over the actual screen so you have to peel the sticker off then it will expose the screw.  Simply unscrew the screw, and pull on the tab.  Then insert the RAM at a 45 degree angle and push down and it will snap into place.  I also upgraded the hard drive to a Samsung 250GB SSD (http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-2-5-Inch-Internal-MZ-75E250B-AM/dp/B00OAJ412U?ie=UTF8&keywords=samsung%20ssd&qid=1461283530&ref_=sr_1_2&s=pc&sr=1-2).  This was a little more challenging than other laptops.  You actually have to take all of the screws out on the bottom (please keep them in order because there are 4 different sizes of screws).  Once you have all the screws out, take a credit card around the seam to prop it open.  Then you will need to disconnect a couple of connections.  There is a really good YouTube video.  Just type Asus F555 hard drive and it will come up.  This laptop is running flawlessly and is so quick.  You can't beat having this good of a laptop for the price (less than $500) with a full HD screen!  I highly recommend it.  I don't know why so many people have given bad reviews on this laptop.  I'm a Packaging Engineer and understand that during manufacturing, you can't have 100% quality so some units just may have been duds.  I love this laptop.  The only complaint I can come up with is I wish it had a backlit keyboard.  I know it is cheap, but I think backlit keyboards should come as a standard, but I'll live."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "There are several good, accurate helpful, reviews about this laptop written already.  Read them.  If you're a serious gamer, if you do extensive video or photo editing or if you just got to have the latest and greatest then move on. This laptop is not for you.  But if you want a great laptop at a great price.  This is for you.\n\nI've had the Asus F555L for a week now.  I installed Office 2016, Vuepro, FireFox and Chrome.  I haven't tried to stress it out but the laptop has no problems with any of these.  My main reason for getting it was to VPN/RDP for work.  I had trouble getting the RDP to connect but that was about W10 and had nothing to do with the Asus.  I'm also using it for email and casual surfing when I'm sitting in front of the TV instead of firing up my main system in the home office.  The laptop is lightweight and hasn't overheated yet, even when I'm playing my game.\n\nEven though it doesn't meet the minimum hardware requirements I installed Elder Scroll Online Tamriel.  My game is significantly slower starting up then on my desktop but it does run at medium settings with almost no slow down and no obvious problems.  The FPS has dropped to about 12-16 in Solo instances and I haven't been on a major dungeon yet. But I wouldn't do that on this small 15 inch screen anyway when I can do it on my 36 inch gaming system.\n\nDrawbacks (not fails or cons really, more like personal preferences):\n-  I did not notice in description that the keyboard is not backlit.  For me this is major disappointment since half the time I use the laptop I'm in a dark room.  The keyboard is completely obscured, I can't type without a light nearby.  I may actually send the laptop back for this reason.\n-  Other reviews mentioned the keyboard flexes and bends.  It does.  Doesn't bother me enough to return the Asus, but it makes it feel \"sub-premium\".\n-  Again the keyboard.  The placement of some keys seem illogical; the right arrow key is part of the number pad, the Home and End keys are separated and placed at the farthest, top right corner when they could easily have been placed closer to regular location; the Insert key is on the zero key!! and needs a Fn to work, totally useless and messes me up; a few other oddities.\n-  Other reviews mentioned the screen brightness is not great.  True.  And you have to be looking directly at the screen and it has to be tilted just right to get best clarity.\n\nDespite the drawbacks I recommend this laptop (for anyone who will use it in a well lit space)  ;-)"}

I give it 4 stars because they have had to compromise in every aspect to make this product at this price point. A low viewing angle screen, but looks fine (not great, but nothing wrong with it) when you are right in front of it. The keyboard is spongy, not the best, but serviceable. The trackpad works well, and is one of the better things about this unit. It tracks well, and is responsive. Battery life is pretty good. Lastly, it has a Blu-ray drive, which I missed in the specs when I ordered it. A nice touch, it works well. Finally, this laptop came with the least amount of pre-installed crapware I have yet seen on a laptop, considering that means I have to spend less time despamming it than I would with another computer.\n\nFor browsing the web, watching movies, and having a modern O/S, this is a fantastic value. Well done Asus. Dollar for dollar, this is a tough machine to beat. If you want to do any serious tasks like video editing, heavy photo-shopping, 3d games, this is not your machine. If you only want to browse, watch movies, and do word processing or emails, (sparingly, the KB is not good enough to write a long thesis or report on), it will do the job well enough.

I don't really use Windows, but I put my terabyte hard drive out of my old laptop that I replaced with this one in an enclosure and with the USB 3 ports it performs as well as the internal drive. The screen is a high res screen with crystal clear graphics. I haven't noticed the problem with mine of viewing it from an angle. It seems viewable from all angles. VT-x/d is enabled by default in the BIOS so running operating systems in a Virtual Box is blazing fast. I did add an extra 8Gigs of RAM. The 802.11ac adapter gives me better signal strength than my Atheros b/g/n adapter did, as advertised.\n\nThe only con I can see is that the keyboard and bezel has to be removed to replace the hard drive.

The process and steps were clearly defined in a YouTube video I found.  The difficult part was making sure I did not break the keyboard when trying to remove it.  The plastic feels very brittle.  It took some time before I felt comfortable applying enough pressure for it to come off.\n\nAs far as general use, the keyboard feels rather flimsy and cheap.  When you type you can feel the keyboard \"dip down\".  With the added SSD the computer boots in a few seconds and feels very snappy with general use.  We will see how the speed holds up over time.

I cloned and swapped the HDD out of the new laptop with an SSHD.  It will take a few uses for the new drive to determine what programs my wife uses the most but I already see an increase in speed.  I slapped in a 8gb of ram to increase memory to 12gb.\n\nBottom line, this computer is a decent buy IF you or someone you know can work on laptops.  Look at it as if you don't really have a warranty aside for DOA devices.  My only concern, when the original laptop's HDD died, was how windows was set up.  What version of 7/8 was originally on it and what were the steps I would need to do in order to get the operating system on a new HDD (since I don't have a windows key and it looks like it was a win10 upgrade)?  Those are questions that Asus must be able to answer.  And telling me that I should have bought the computer from best buy is not an acceptable answer.  This laptop is a best seller on Amazon - you guys need to be prepared to offer support for online purchases that is on par with the support for purchases made at a brick and mortar store.\n\n**UPDATE**\nAmazon to the rescue.  Amazon agreed to send me a new laptop.  The replacement laptop is configured differently.  The original HDD had several partitions on on it while the new one is just a single partition - i found that strange.  The original laptop prompted me to register the unit when I did the initial set up but this new one didn't.  Also, the replacement touchpad is sitting above the casing opposed to slighly indented below the casing.  Amazon said it was supposed to a brand new one but I have my doubts.\n\nBottom line, if this laptop was for me, I would have taken the refund instead.  But this is for my wife and her school and art work.  She likes it so I am fine with the replacement.\n\nJust don't expect Asus Support to be any help.  I am sure Amazon would interested to know that the Asus support agent repeatedly said I should have purchased this from Best Buy because it is easier for them to \"repair.\"\n\n** INITIAL REVIEW**\nListen to the other reviews and replace that HDD ASAP.  I thought we would try out the laptop with the original HDD for a few months then upgrade to an SSD or SSHD...my mistake.  Was great for the first 3 months.  Then the HDD completely failed and the nightmare began.  I tried to clone - no deal, too many bad sectors.  I have contacted ASUS multiple times too and their only response is for me to send them back the entire laptop for repair but they were also unable to supply me with a time frame.  One agent said maybe 8 weeks: absolutely unacceptable, my wife needs this for her business and school.  I then just asked how could i get a windows disc so i could just replace the HDD myself and was told that i needed to buy the retail version of windows 10 because ASUS only supplies windows xp, vista and 7 discs per their customer service."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "I have only had this item for a few days, so I haven't been able to really spend a whole lot of time with it. During the time that I have had it, it has been wonderful, and I really don't foresee any problems arising. Upon receiving the laptop I replaced the spinning drive with and 850 evo SSD, and I also added an 8 GB memory module, bringing the memory up to the max supported, which is 12 GB. I clean installed Windows 10 without any issues.\n\nI have never owned a computer with anything less than an i5 processor, but I wanted something to use besides my beefy i7 gaming rig, and I had my sights set on a low powered laptop, I was first considering a Celeron or Pentium, but when I saw this thing with a core series processor, and a 1080 display I figured I couldn't go wrong for the price. I will say that the display is not the best, but for what you pay, it is great. I couldn't see using this as my only computer, but as a supplement to a desktop it is perfect. I will say that this would probably be a great computer for a kid too."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "This is an excellent buy. After reading so many negative reviews, I just had to let you know my experience, one from a highly technical person who has not only used and repaired, but prepped hundreds and hundreds of new laptops.\nI ordered it Tuesday night, it arrived Wednesday afternoon. Yes, it would have been free two-day shipping with Prime, but I couldn't wait, so I paid the extra pittance of $11 for one day shipping.\nI was surprised by the large box that I was able to shake and feel contents easily move around. When opened, it was just the laptop box with a strip of paper keeping it from sliding to the edges of the larger box. The laptop box itself packed the laptop well enough I don't think this made much difference. However (are you listening Amazon?), I would have been MUCH happier if the smaller box was completely held in place more securely.\n\nAs to the laptop...\nI gave it 5 stars, yet it's really, for me, about 4 and 1/2, maybe 4 and 3/4 stars. An outstanding value for the price, with just a couple of things I wished they had made easier from a (techie) consumer point of view. Namely, the inability to remove the battery and, the difficulty in changing out the included hard drive for an SSD and, being able to only add one (1) memory module (as opposed to being able to take out the included RAM and add TWO much larger modules).\nBattery: I like to take out the battery when I have this plugged in at home and only put it back in when I take it out on the road. Most laptop batteries last about 300 charges - or for most people - about 1 year, before they begin to lose their charge very quickly. This is normal. I have laptops that still hold a charge for 2-5 hours that are over 5 years old because I plug them in, without the battery installed, every chance I get.\n\nHard Drive: The included 5400 rpm Hard Drive is fine. Large enough for most people and was zippy enough, taking only 41 seconds to boot to the desktop when I was finished installing my Anti-virus, games and office programs. BUT, an SSD is much, much faster. (may  take under 10 seconds to boot?) In fact, I bought a 256GB Samsung 850 EVO SSD (solid state drive) to replace the original \"spinning platter\" (like a phonograph record) drive. However, the laborious task of completely taking apart the shell, just to get to the hard drive AND the fact that the included drive is actually working fine (for now?) is putting me off on making the swap, even though I've already prepped the SSD.\n I've done this with many, many laptops. It's not actually all that difficult. BUT you absolutely must take great care when pulling things apart. It is EXTREMELY easy to tear out hidden ribbons and cables. Making that task, particularly on a laptop I've never done it on before, take an especially long, slow, and careful experience. I'm just not sure I want to take the time since it already works fine. Maybe this weekend, if I have the time. I'll edit if I do. First I want to test it out with the basic defaults.\n\nRAM: The included 4GB memory is fine for most purposes. Adding another 8GB stick just allows me to do more things at once. However, I would have liked the opportunity to add TWO 8 GB sticks and have 16GBs instead of only 12GB.\nIt did take me less than 3 minutes to add a new stick. Less than a minute to open the packaging, about a minute to unscrew and pop the RAM cover on the bottom of the computer, and about a minute to insert it, and put the cover back in place.\n*Note: if you do this, be sure to handle ONLY THE EDGES of the stick and insert it at a 45 degree angle, ALL the way in, before pushing it down in place. Also, obviously, be sure the laptop is unplugged and turned off.\n**Note 2: The makers covered up the screw with a tiny piece of stick paper. If you take a small sharp knife, you should be able to gently lift if up from the corner, leave it on the knife and replace it after screwing everything back down.\n\nHere are the reasons I believe this is an outstanding value:\n- Large screen. Full HD (High Definition). 1920x1080. Many laptops this size use much larger pixels so things appear larger, but you actually see less on the screen.\n  *Note: This was also one of the detractors. The 15\" screen is nearly as large as my 17\" laptop's screen. It has very wide bezels\n- 500 GB hard drive. I would expect to pay another $100-$200 for a 1TB drive to be included. So this was fair.\n\n- 2 USB 3.0 slots. USB 1.0 con transfer only 1.5MB per second (MBps), 2.0 is forty times that at 60MBps, and USB 3.0 is 10x faster than that! At 640MBps. AMAZINGLY fast if backing up to an external drive. And you get TWO of them, woot!\n- Wi-Fi of 802.11ac. Most laptops are still touting 802.11n. Which is much better and faster than 802.11g. But \"ac\" is 3x faster than that!\nPLUS.. you get the advantage of being able to handle connections to both 2.4GHz AND 5GHz at the same time.\nLet me explain.. Think of yourself having a conversation with someone in normal tones, and having a mosquito buzzing. Two different tones, or frequencies, but both clearly able to be heard, at the same time. Then imagine having a conversation with TWO people, both speaking in normal tones, at the same time. Difficult to really catch what one is saying over the other. Well, that's what the two frequencies help with. While most others around you are using 802.11n/b/g (all running at 2.4GHz), kind of like having a small room full of people speaking at the same time with their voices echoing back and becoming jumbled and hard to hear, you can be using the 5GHz frequency which isn't interfered with by all the other voices. You could also be using your Bluetooth devices at the same time, and having little to no interference. Nowadays, Bluetooth headsets, microphones, mice, keyboards, 802.11b/g/n devices and even microwave ovens, all interfere with each other at the 2.4GHz level.\n\n- A DVD read/writer that both reads AND writes to normal DVDs AND DUAL Layer DVD's. *instead of only 4.7GBs you get 8.4GBs per side!\n\n- CPU: A Dual-Core i3 that includes \"Hyper-threading\" and runs at 2.1GHz. Yes, you're paying for that. Many laptops for $100 less are running \"atom\" processors at only 1.6 or 1.8 GHZ. Much, much slower, and less able to run multiple things at the same time.\n*Note: \"Hyper-Threading\" helps the CPU process things about 37% faster. For example, lets say there are two ticket takers in the movie theater, taking tickets from 2 lines of people. Obviously this is much faster than only 1 ticket taker, but not really *twice* as fast, since hey still have to wait for each person to shuffle forward with their ticket, which they may or may not have immediately ready to hand to the ticket-taker.\nNow think of a third line, a \"standby\" line. Where, while a ticket-taker is waiting for someone in the main line to shuffle forward or get their ticket ready, they can take a ticket from the next person in the \"stand-by\" line.\n(**BTW: This is also why a Core-i5 CPU is faster than a Core-i3. It doesn't have 'Hyper-threading\", but instead has 4 cores instead of two. So it can have 4 dedicated lines - without any standby line. And a Core-i7 has 4 cores AND 'hyperthreading').\n\n- Keyboard: Large, with soft/quiet feel on the keys, yet with decent tactile touches. It also includes a 10-key. (keys 0-9) on the side.\n*Note: This was also a point of contention for me, both the overall size of the screen and keyboard. More on those at the bottom of this review.\n- External Video Outputs: Both an HDMI AND a VGA connector. So I can hook-up to TVs in hotel rooms to watch Netflix or my own movies off the laptop, And/or will easily connect to any projectors out there. You have to supply your own cable(s) of course.\n*This will also connect to a 2nd or larger monitor. Most will accept one or the other of the connections.\n\n- Gigabit Ethernet (the *wired* connection using a cable/cord): Again, not just the normal, and completely acceptable 100mbps (Megabits per second) of most laptops, but a Gigabit or 1,000mbps connection that is 10 times faster. Now.. this will obviously make NO difference in a hotel room, business meeting etc, where the standard actually is only \"Fast Ethernet\" or 100mbps. However, if you're at home, or your office where you have a full gigabit connectivity (That is your laptop, the ethernet cable or cord, the connector in the wall, the lines through the building, the switch(es), drop points and router, etc. If ALL are gigabit capable) you will be able to connect to your internal servers, printers or other computers/servers on your network 10x faster. Copy, upload, download, stream, all much, much faster!\n\n* A note on additional items and value:\nAdding to the laptop the extra RAM (I got from Amazon also, as recommended by another reviewer, and it works great)\nKingston HyperX Impact Black 8GB 1600MHz DDR3L CL9 SODIMM 1.35V Laptop Memory (HX316LS9IB/8) @ $36\nI know have a Fast, capable laptop right at $400.\nEven adding the SSD (Samsung 850 EVO 250GB 2.5-Inch SATA III Internal SSD (MZ-75E250B/AM) ,@ $86\nand a wireless mouse (TeckNet Pro 2.4G Wireless Mouse,Nano Receiver,6 Buttons,24 Month Battery Life,2400 DPI 3 Adjustment Levels ) @ $9 still puts me under $500 for an outstanding laptop that blows anything else at that price point out of the water.\nI would expect to pay at least another $100 if I wanted a Core-i5 CPU. But really, I'm not using it for gaming. But am using it for more than just email and surfing the web. I expect to have multiple web browser windows open running google docs, google map searches, LogMeIn. At the same time running Word, Excel, Outlook, streaming music, and some kind of camera like the built in webcam or an external for surveillance or Skype, while either burning or copying DVD's... all at the same time.\nI expect this Core-i3 will handle all of that easily, and then some.\n** I will update my experiences on that after usage.\n\nCurrently I highly recommend this product if, that is, you don't mind the large keyboard and overall size almost at par with a 17\" model.\n\nMy first Impressions:\nOpening the laptop box was a fun experience. Not difficult at all, just nice. I won't add any spoiler in case you order one.\nAs another reviewer mentioned, I was surprised that it turned on immediately as I plugged it in. But, no worries, I was going to turn it on in the next second or two anyway.\nI did NOT find it to be \"plasticky\" or \"cheap\" feeling. Instead the outside and keyboard are firm enough and.. made of a material that won't show fingerprints.\nI was also very surprised and quite happily excited to find the almost complete lack of \"Bloatware\" or \"Adware\" that other reviewers said they had. That is, programs and applications with icons scattered across the screen for things that most people don't want, or need, but still click on and install because they either don't know what the programs are for, or that they think they need to install them, etc.\nMost people who complain about Bloatware probably don't realize that is how many companies are able to offer their products at a low price point. The Adware/Bloatware manufacturers pay the laptop company for space on the screen/hard drive, and in return, the laptop company passes savings onto us.\nHowever.. this laptop (the ASUS F555LA-AB31 15.6-inch Full-HD Laptop (Core i3, 4GB RAM, 500GB HDD) with Windows 10) didn't have ANY extra or included \"bloatware\" that I could see. Only extra stuff from Microsoft like Xbox connection, 3D power, MS Money, OneNote, etc. and a couple of ASUS items. All of which were/are perfectly acceptable items that you actually might like to use. Not really considered bloatware at all.\n\nAlso.. if it HAD included anything I didn't want, I would simply have gone into the Add/Remove programs setting and just deleted them. Done.\n\nA note on setup:\n- A couple of reviewers mentioned they had viruses/malware either right out of the box or shortly thereafter.\nNow.. it *could* be that was a computer that was returned after having been infected by it's previous owner and somehow slipped through cracks of the process designed to receive used laptops, refurbish/wipe out/reinstall the drives.\nBut honestly, I feel confident that most people with those experiences simply infected themselves through lack of knowledge.\nThe moment you plug your computer, any computer with (especially) Windows into a working network, either wired or wireless, you are opening yourself to becoming attacked and possibly infected. If you put a computer onto the internet without any kind of protection it is quite possible for it to become infected within JUST A FEW MINUTES!\nPossibly from other computers on your home network!!!\n\nSo... BEFORE connecting to ANY network, you want to make sure your PC is ready, and as protected as possible.\nThere are plenty of places telling you what to do to set up Windows 10 and such, so I'll just include the basics of what to do/have ready, before you connect to the network.\n- Ensure Windows Defender is Turned ON (yes I know, it's not that powerful, but you'll be installing a GOOD Anti-virus/Firewall in a couple of minutes\n- Create a \"Repair Disk\" (just in case anything goes wonky in the next few minutes, or year)\n- Make a backup to either an external hard drive or DVDs (this will take only 2 dual layer DVDs or 4 regular recordable ones)\n *If you backup to an external drive (USB), be sure to include a \"system image\" with it.\n- Turn on System Restore, give yourself about 10% of your drive for this.\n- Install a good 3rd party Anti-virus/Firewall program such as Norton, Kapersky, McAfee, Webroot, Bitdefender, Avast, AVG, ESET, etc.\n- Go online and FIRST update your anti-malware program (the one above you just installed).\n- Update Windows.\nFinally, don't click on any link in ANY email, unless you are absolutely sure you know where it's coming from and taking you. There are websites being created every single day to thwart/bypass all your current security procedures. You aren't protected from the new threats until your antivirus company finds them, creates a protection from them, and you download that protection.\nJust because the email is from your mom, and the link says, \"I love you\" doesn't mean it's actually from your mom (although she still probably loves you). If you're not sure.. (I have several non-techie family members that forward stuff to me all the time without any explanation), but you believe the email is from someone you trust, email them back (DON'T hit [Reply], the return address might just be the spammer/infector) and ask if they sent it, and why.\n\nThings I didn't like:\n- Windows 10, Home edition: Getting the home edition may be fine for most people who just do stuff at home or school. But if the laptop includes Intel VT (Virtual Technology) which this one does, you can't use it with the \"Home\" edition.\nOkay, okay. I realize most people don't use VT.. yet. But I do, and so do many other techies like me. If I have an extra CPU (I do) and some extra RAM (I do), then I could create what's known as a \"virtual machine\". Sort of like another computer within the computer, and install a completely different OS (operating system) on it like Windows XP, Vista, Windows 7 or Linux, and use it - completely separate from the \"host\" OS - as either a test bed (we call it a \"sandbox\" cause you can just go in and play around in it, then either save or undo the changes you made) for checking out new programs and such. OR.. run an OS like Linux on it, and use it as a server or as a completely different tool for a ton of different purposes.\n\nIt would have been MUCH better to have included Windows 7 pro (or even the horrid Windows8), both of which include a free upgrade to Windows 10 (as long as you do it before July 29, 2016). Personally, I'm quite happy with Windows 7. Especially if I'm not gaming.\nSo.. now, in order to use the VT, I have to either pay for an upgrade to Windows 10 Pro/Ultimate or Wipe everything out, Install a pro/ultimate version of windows 7 and use the free upgrade to Windows 10.\n\nThe Size - it's HUGE:(see my picture)\nOk.. this is a minor pet peeve. I actually expected this laptop to be quite a bit smaller than my 17\" model. It's not.\nIt's only about an inch less wide, and 1/2 an inch less deep. The actual LCD screen size is\n13 1/2 x 7 3/4 (15.5 in diagonal) this laptop vs\n15\" x 8 1/2 (17.25 in diagonal) on the 17\" laptop.\nBut the bezel outside the screen is nearly 1/2\" wider on each side than the 17\".\nEven the keyboard is larger. This laptop 13.5 x 4 1/8\" vs. the 17\" laptop at 13.25 x 3 7/8!\nI mean, I enjoy having the 10 key (even without the \"Number lock\" indicator light) but to have the keys that spread apart is just ridiculous to me. Personally I don't mind having the keys crammed together as in the picture of the 14\" laptop on the left, as long as they are full-sized keys AND laid out in a proper QWERTY style. But to have them spread out as wide (or wider) as a stand alone keyboard... ugh. Moreover, there's the whole \"palm rest\" portion. I don't know about you, but I'm a big guy, over 6 feet tall, with proportionately large hands, and even I don't need all that extra real-estate to rest my arms on. Easily could have taken an entire inch off the depth, as well as nearly an entire inch off the width.\n\nSo.. in conclusion, with all the above being said, if you don't mind a 'Home' version of Windows, a spread out keyboard and larger than needed overall size, the inability to remove the battery, the ability to only add one additional RAM stick, difficulty swapping out the hard drive to an SSD, and the lack of any indicator lights (Caps Lock, Num Lock, etc.) but want a computer for a great price, that's fast, will multi-task well, comes with pretty much all the bells and whistles you could ask for (802.11ac, Gigabit Ethernet, Full HD screen, HDMI as well as VGA and VT if you want to upgrade to a Windows Pro version, etc.; then this is for you.\nAn outstanding buy for most people. An excellent purchase for me.\nI highly recommend it.\n4/1/2016\n======================="}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "My mother visited me recently and I got a first-hand look at her personal laptop. In short, it was a mess - buggy, full of viruses and prone to spontaneous crashes. I knew that she depended on her laptop to keep in touch with family and friends so something had to be done.\n\nA binge of researching led me to the ASUS F55LA. I ordered it with and additional 8 gigs of RAM as well as a  Samsung 850 EVO 250GB solid state drive. Don't be deterred from upgrading the hard drive - the 850 EVO comes with the necessary software to clone the hard drive and it is pretty much idiot proof. The hardest part is opening up the machine to swap the drives and there are several videos online that walk you through the process.\n\nSeriously folks, enhancing this laptop with these upgrades makes it into a very capable machine. My 'daily driver' is a 15\" MacBook Pro and I felt very comfortable working with this laptop. It is fast, light and runs cool. The battery life is about 4 hours which is sufficient for a non-business user.\n\nThe biggest drawback is the screen - it has very limited viewing angles. But once you find the 'sweet spot' and crank the brightness to max it's not a bad viewing experience. Windows 10 is also not all that bad, and this is coming from an OSX fan. It will be perfect for Mom as it is very close to the Windows 7 she's used to. It even comes with Windows Defender, Microsoft's take on their own virus protection software.\n\nBottom line, for $500 you can get a decent laptop.  Highly recommended and I'm sure it will be a hit with Mom. :)"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "UPDATED REVIEW as of November 7th, 2016.\nComputer was great for 7 months. It was fast for all that time and was everything I wanted for a computer.\n\nThen...last week I had a very stupid moment and accidentally ran over my backpack with my car. Yes, that happened somehow. My computer was inside the backpack. The screen got smashed and the keyboard got all messed up. I sent it in for repair and have been notified that I will be sent a new computer.\n\nTherefore my updated review would be that the computer doesn't seem very robust but for this price range, what can you expect? Be careful or get a protective case if you're clumsy like me. I also have to hand it to Asus for good customer service because I was transparent about the physical damages and they're helping me out big time.\n\n===========================================================================================================\nInitial review as of March 29th, 2016.\nAfter a lot of time spent researching computers I ended up getting this laptop. I wanted an affordable, reliable, powerful machine that can handle some bigger applications. So far, I really like it. I took the advice of some other folks and did some upgrading. This laptop now boots in 8 seconds and loads applications in eye blinks. Only gripe so far is battery life, which seems like it should be higher for a brand new laptop. But I can't complain, I just switched from a 6 year-old laptop that had zero battery life. I also read that some folks thought this device generally has a cheap feeling. I disagree - it feels fine to me and Asus computers are known for being reliable.\n\nI got a 250 GB Solid State Drive for it, which is basically an advanced type of hard drive.\nhttp://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OAJ412U/ref=twister_B00PRDMHLU?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1\n\nWhen the new SSD goes in, the old hard drive comes out, and you can turn that old hard drive into a 500 GB mass storage device for backing up computers and storing a ton of files.\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Upgraded-Sabrent-2-5-Inch-Enclosure-EC-UM30/dp/B00MQ97QGE/ref=sr_1_3?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1459290627&sr=1-3&keywords=sabrent+2.5+ssd+sata+hard+drive+usb+3.0+enclosure\n\nFinally I got 8 GB of RAM to upgrade this laptop. This lets the computer operate with reduced strain. Don't criticize my technological explanations here, I'm just a common folk with minimal knowledge regarding computer specs.\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Crucial-PC3-12800-204-Pin-Notebook-CT102464BF160B/dp/B006YG8X9Y?ie=UTF8&psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00\n\nThe total investment was $370 for the laptop, $87 for the SSD, $45 to pay someone to install the SSD, $33 for the 8 GB of RAM, and $10 for the external hard drive case. So for about $550 I ended up with a 250 GB SSD, 12 GB RAM, blazing fast computer, plus a mass storage device.\n\nRegarding the hardware installation: the RAM is very easy to do, you just open up a little slot at the bottom of the computer and stick it in like a battery. Putting in the Solid State Drive is a lot more involved for this computer though (as in taking the whole thing apart). I called Asus and asked if it would be okay to perform hardware installation and they said yes, but if anything breaks, you lose your 1 year warranty. This is why I had the Solid State Drive professionally installed. I worry about this kind of stuff, but I'm sure it wouldn't be too complicated to do on your own. Had I waited a year for the warranty to expire and get the SSD, I probably would've tried myself.\n\nI'll be updating my review in a few months."}

I then performed a fresh install of Linux Mint Cinnamon. Everything worked out of the box, with no configuration necessary.\n\nI noticed that when I was on campus my machine had trouble connecting to the WiFi, and if I turned off the wireless adapter and restarted it, the machine would freeze and require a hard reset. I replaced the wireless card with an Intel 7260. HMWG.R and the problems went away completely.\n\nThis machine definitely has enough oomph for just about any task you throw at it. The only time I notice any sort of lag or stuttering is when doing extremely resource-intensive tasks, as is to be expected with nearly every machine. Unless you're actively attempting to make the machine run slow, you'll definitely have plenty of processing power.\n\nI was disappointed when opening the machine [ to add an SSD, remove the optical drive, and swap the wireless card ] to find that all the screws are made of softer metal and strip easily. I almost completely stripped one internal screw holding the hdd caddy in place.\n\nI cannot comment on how the machine runs stock - I've never run any sort of Windows on it, nor have I ever booted it from a mechanical drive.\n\nUsing the machine is nice. The touchpad works well, it boots in ~10 seconds, battery lasts ~6 hours. The keyboard has a touch of flex in it, but the overall build quality is very good. I may put another 8GB of RAM in the machine at a later date, but I haven't needed even the full 4GB so far. As an aside, the 4GB that comes with the machine  is soldered onto the board - there is one free slot which can accommodate up to 8GB for a total of 12GB max in the machine."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "Update:\nI have had this laptop for about a month.  I have to say that it has either met, or exceeded, my expectations.  I added an 8gb stick of RAM for a total of 12gb.  I also thought about adding an SSD but found the drive it came with was sufficient.  This laptop is just for casual use so an SSD is really something I don't need.  So far I really can't complain about anything regarding this laptop.  I had initial reservations about sound quality but this has not been an issue at all.  In fact, the sound has been very good with more than sufficient volume and better than most laptops I have owned.  It runs very cool and quiet while delivering very good performance.  I continue to be appreciative of the 1080p screen.  I fired up my old laptop with its 1366x728 screen and found it to look horrible by comparison.  It may not be the best 1080p screen but it is far better than a 1366x768 screen.\n\nI wouldn't hesitate to recommend this laptop.  For the price it delivers exceptional value.\n\nPlenty of reviews here pointing out the pros and cons of this laptop so I will keep it simple and to the point.\n\nWhat I like:\n-  The 1080P screen is very vice and well worth the price paid whether with this laptop or any other.\n-  Overall quality for the price is very good.\n-  Processor is quite snappy\n-  Keyboard isn't nearly as bad as I have read in other reviews\n-  Laptop is very quiet.  No hard drive noise and very little fan noise due to a cool running CPU\n-  Only used one memory slot so upgrading to 8 or 12 gb of RAM is less expensive\n-  Access to memory slots is easy\n\nWhat I don't like:\n-  The touchpad is has the button click feature over the entire pad area which makes tapping the surface feel less solid\n-  It is hard to tell when your finger is over the right or left mouse button as the entire touchpad surface is sooth\n-  I am not a fan of the charger.  It is too short since the brick part plugs directly into the wall socket\n-  The battery is internal but this is the case with most newer laptops\n-  The laptop has to have the bottom cover removed to access/replace the hard drive.  Again, most newer laptops are the same\n-  Would rather have the speaker ports on top and under the screen.  They are placed under the leading lower edge.  So far not a\n  big issue though regarding sound playback\n\nSo overall, I am satisfied with this laptop.  Especially considering the price.  There is nothing out there that I could find that offered an i3 CPU and a 1080p screen for anywhere near the price.  I can't say enough how nice it is to have a 1080p screen on a 15\"+ laptop.  I will never buy a laptop with a resolution less than 1080p again."}

Windows 10 seems great so far. I have not done any updates (many people saying that the updates tanked their wifi) So I will wait til they have that figured out).\n\nAll in all, I would recommend this and I would buy it again. I hunted for months and almost dropped $800 on the new dell i7xxx. This computer gets the job done. No issues so far!\n\nPROS- LOW COST! HD!

No heat at all on the palm rest...very quiet even when the fan is running. Can have it right next to someone who is sleeping and not disturb them a bit.\n\nThe only complaint I would have about it at all is that there is no LED light indicators telling you when caps lock or number lock are engaged/disengaged on the keyboard. Seriously, that is my ONLY complaint about this laptop."}

Really light. Nice looks. Not too big. Fast enough for ordinary family use. Combo audio port a bit of a pain but with an adapter is under control. On-board speakers are better than two other low end Dell laptops around here. Lasts a long time on battery. Fast recharge. It was a pain to set up administrator and user accounts and transfer user files, favorites, etc., but that was par for the course for Windows. Not at all as nice as a MacBook but only a quarter of the price and makes a great second computer around the house. 4 Gb is adequate. If you want to do gaming or number-crunching or audio-video processing you might want something bigger. Has an irritating note taking app I can't get off the desktop but we learned to ignore it. Too bad it does not have on-board encryption chips, but all the home use laptops don't rate $14 in additional electronics."}

I will be looking to purchase another ASUS  in the future.\n\nI've had my ASUS F555LA laptop for about a week now. I added 8gb additional ram for a total of 12gb. I also changed out the HD with a Samsung 850 EVO 250gb SSD. Battery life is decent, lasts for several hours. Laptop runs _cool_. I run a couple virtual machines using virtualbox, surf the web, chat / email programs and everything operates smoothly. I'm not actively trying to max out the CPU but it seems to multitask fairly well.\n\nTouchpad is nice, but I still prefer a mouse so I bought a Logitech trackball m570. I read some reviews on here prior to buying this that complained about the keyboard. I'm able to type without issue.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "This laptop is amazing for the price. I picked it up used for 260. I wanted a laptop I could do light gaming on, no new tripple A games or anything like that. Just old school games and newer ones that are low resource. Gotta say, it does it's job well. I played Counter-Strike:Source and Path of Exile on it smoothly. Of course these aren't ultra high settings but it worked. I also took the time to upgrade some of the parts. My totally cost was 355.00.\n\nI replaced the hard drive with a Crucial BX200 240GB SATA 2.5 Inch Internal Solid State Drive for 65.00.\nThe SSD really makes it boots fast and makes everything feel very great. It's my first time using an SSD and I have to say I highly recommend it. I originally bought a external hard drive case for it but my wife's laptop hard drive started to fail so I ended up replacing her's with it.\n\nI put a stick of Crucial 8GB Single DDR3 1600 MT/s (PC3-12800) CL11 SODIMM 204-Pin 1.35V/1.5V Notebook Memory for 30.00.\nThe ram was easy to install compared to the hard drive, one screw easy. The 4gb it has is integrated and couldn't be removed. When I installed the ram it wouldn't go in all the way originally so I had to man handle it in. After finishing install the ram I went into the bios and changed the video ram up to 512mb from the 32mbs.\n\nI followed these two video to replace the hard drive and it wasn't to hard as it was my first time cracking into a laptop.\n\n[...]\n\n[...]\nThe biggest problem I encountered was with Avast. After installing it, it would throw me into a start up loop that I couldn't get out of. It took me 4 factory resets and 2 fresh installs of windows 10 for me to figure this out. So, If your keeping 10 on it and you install Avast then throws a start up loop on you. It's probably Avast."}

I was very pleased when I opened this up to get it setup for the customer. It is a very nice laptop! And at this price point- one of the best you can get. The sound is solid and rich, the HD screen is beautiful, very decent performance. A perfect laptop for most usage. Gaming is fine for most titles though some of the newest games may lag a bit at high  settings. Asus puts out some awesome products and I tend to use alot of their stuff in system builds. This laptop does not disappoint. The only con would be the 4GB of RAM. I would upgrade that first thing. If I was in the market for a laptop I would buy this one for myself."}

(massively worth it do this!) I will list the drive cage and memory I got below.\n\nThis laptop is a great for the price. I have used other laptops with the older Core i3 cpus and they were not very tolerable. Especially the lenovo I use at work. I hate that thing. I was a bit concerned about the performance of this cheap laptop but I must say that it has exceeded my expectations. It boots up lightning quick now that I have a solid state drive and low intensity applications run as fast as my custom built desktop. The feel is definitely not bad for the price. It does have a cheaper plastic feel to it, but what would you expect for the price?  I find the silver color of the body and track pad to be a little annoying from the glare from the screen so I ordered a brushed black aluminum vinyl wrap for the lid and keyboard tray. Aesthetically it will make it much more pleasing as well.\n\nI wouldn't expect to run modern games on this laptop but that is honestly not what I bought it for. By far it is the best laptop for under 500. There isn't even another option I would consider unless it had a 1080p screen. The viewing angle of the screen is  a little poor but I find it is not much of a concern as I am sitting directly in front of it when I use it anyways. All in all I would totally recommend this laptop to anyone who wants a cheap laptop to do basic work on. Just don't expect miracles out of a 350 dollar laptop and you will be happy with it.\n\nSwap DVD drive for solid state hard drive:\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GNVLUPY?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00\nShips from china but it got here reasonably quick.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "I purchased this computer from Amazon exactly one month ago.  While I seldom write reviews, I was so satisfied with this product and with the job that Asus has done for us here that I felt it was necessary for me to at least give my impression briefly.  I was working on an aging HP laptop, about 4 years old, which gave me excellent service over the time I had it.  Having gone through many computers, I can honestly say that  that the most satisfaction of \"having made a deal\" has come from this one.  For the price, the screen quality is outstanding, the machine boots in 6 to 10 seconds and shuts down completely in about the same amount of time. I only have 7 of my own programs installed because that's really all I need and I keep the programs out of Startup.  The original HDD is in place, as I see no reason for installing an SSD at this time.  I have deleted none of the programs that were bundled by Asus because I didn't find them to be obtrusive or excessive.  I was able to install the Kingston 8GB memory module that someone else recommended here in less that 5 minutes and now have 12Gigs of memory (I'm not sure about the pairing of the memory to 4GB on-board and 4GB expanded but 12 sounded better than eight to me, for those interested in expanding the on-board memory this should probably be reasearched).  One important point here that you will all see causing problems if you go through the reviews is that, for some reason, Asus has covered the Phillips screw to the cover of the casing of the memory module with a rubber circle exactly matching the head of the screw.  This is confusing because it is not obvious that there is a screw there at all. This lead one of the reviewers here to think that the cover was of the snap off variety.  Unfortunately, in trying to pry it out, he ended up breaking it.\n\nOther than that small point, this is a quite solid machine, beautifully engineered IMHO, and with several features just not found in a sub-$500 laptop, such as:  the bright and quite beautiful 1920x1080p resolution screen,  the \"adequate\" 5th generation Broadwell processor, the 80211 A/C WiFi, Bluetooth 4 (don't take it for granted), and an unbelievable one year warranty that *includes drops and spills.*  In essence, this could be a machine for some who doesn't need the bleeding edge of technology, but who wants to keep themselves up date with a machine that looks good, performs well, and will fend for itself until the next one comes along."}

Couldn't apply any updates from Microsoft due to the OS not being genuine.  Couldn't unlock. Wasn't provided a product key to activate windows either. For me at least, this was a waste of money.

Works pretty good stock, can't quite imagine how it will run after I start getting the right stuff to complete upgrades to Samsung 850 ssd, extra stick of ram memory,\n\nI want to use the hhd as an external b/u but I don't have an enclosure because not sure what to buy yet. Also have to see if I need any cables , screws, install brackets??I will find out when I get a look inside the box.  Have reviewed the videos and feel confident on the task at hand.  I have also decided to use a fresh  windows 10 stick to do a clean install of 10,  I  will need it for another 5 year old HP laptop I have which needs some new hardware and OS 10 from Vista. Not sure yet if its going to be doable.\n\nUPDATE:\nOkay got the remaining upgrade components today. Installed the ram memory stick  (8g additional),that was easy.\nAmazon delivery by post office was split into two delivery days then still missing a couple of things,  rest showed two hours later by UPS guy. SO,finally decided to change the hard drive but I was wondering if I needed special cables going HHD to SSD drive?  Decided to take another look at u-tube and found a short video on drive installation. He was doing a F555LA ASUS.  Great! Just what I needed at the moment. This guy works fast,he changed the drive in 6 MINUTES.  From the time he removed the screws, popped the cover, swapped drives,re-installed, replaced cover,  flipped it over, pushed the WIN 10 on a Zip drive into the usb socket,  power on, started loading the OS. WOW! That was s fast. Now I said I can do that, maybe  15 minutes. Turns out he didn't need any additional hardware for mounting the drive or different cables. He re-used the old ribbon cables. 4 connections,  that's it. I was completely off base thinking I needed something different,  I was confusing the drive cloning procedure where you would have the old drive patched in (during the copy) to the new Samsung 850 sata ssd. I wasn't putting any data from my old HP laptop into the new F555LA ASUS  laptop.\nTo me the zip drive Win 10 was the way to go.  The young man did it in 6 minutes, it took me about 35 minutes from start of drive install to finish loading the Windows 10. I never said I knew anything about computers. Lol. This thing boots in15 seconds. Darn, I am a happy man, getting a little geeky. Ha!\nNow I need to run the  read/write tests to see how fast the new drive is running. Any program suggestions for the testing? Free. Thanks folks.  Love this Asus F555LA. Now need my girlfriend to get a few software packages at the University, which are very reasonably priced.

That alone should make you question whether or not to leave a bad review, but if it doesn't, then filter your search for i3 processors and see what average price for other laptops are.  This laptop, for the price, is the best deal you'll find on the internet.\n\nI received this laptop about two weeks ago and took the advice from other reviewers by upgrading the RAM and changing the HDD to a SSD, and honestly, I'm not sure I could ask for a better machine for a total cost of about $500.  Yes, the keyboard is a bit flimsy and certainly not as nice as the keyboard on my girlfriend's MacBook Air, and yes, the track pad is slightly eratic.  But you just paid $375 for it!  If you expect the quality of a $1,100 computer, then you're going to have to suck it up and pay $1,100 for a computer.\n\nThe computer came out of the box operating pretty quickly with the 4 GB of RAM and the regular HDD, so if you're not comfortable opening the machine up and making the upgrades, this computer will still be perfectly sufficient.  But, those of you willing to make the upgrades, holy crap.  This machine, with the extra 8 GB of RAM and the SSD, is an absolute powerhouse.  Just yesterday, I had about 10 Chrome tabs open, composing a message in Outlook while casting (in the background) some media to my ROKU, and this computer didn't so much as hiccup.\n\nI'm glad to answer any questions anyone might have."}

I ended up adding a 4GB stick of RAM in it, and replaced the hard drive with an SSD. Which made this a really nice machine. My only gripe is the keyboard is a little cheap, there is a lot of flex and you have to press the spacebar kind of hard sometimes for it to register, but not a huge deal. By no means is it a super powerful computer, can't do much gaming or anything. I'm just using it for school, and I run some VMs on it occasionally and it handles them just fine. Overall I love this computer, great screen, fast WIFI (if you have an ac router, which I do.) I get really great battery life with this computer, and its pretty light and thin."}

My only advice is STAY AWAY!! from day one it gave me issues. I kept it for a few weeks hoping it was just a bug that would not be that big of a deal. That was not the case. windows home button stopped working, My mouse kept randomly disappearing. It tried to install updates at every single restart. Then it would come up and say that the updates did not work. Then the keyboard spazzed out on me and when I pushed different keys different windows would open up.  My last straw was when I uploaded a few pics from my SD card. The screen had a distinct \"Foggy\" appearance. I could not see any of my pictures in a decent color. it looked like I was looking through a sheer fabric in front of the screen.\n\nI am so thankful that amazon refunded me on this laptop. Please do not waste your money."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "It's a great laptop, it can run the few games that I play. I installed 8gb of RAM so I have 12gb on this PC. The only issue is that a screw came loose, which caused the case to rub whenever I opened the laptop, not much of an issue, but it shouldn't be an issue. Especially with a reputable company like ASUS. I do take care of my technology as I have had a tablet that customers said \"It lasts only a few months\", that same tablet is still working and I purchased it a year ago. Also, after the latest windows update, it had an issue booting up. Had to shut it down and restart it SEVERAL times. Again, great product for the price. The keyboard is a little hard on my fingers, I have hands on the larger side, but not quite large. Also, the keyboard collects hair and dust like crazy, then gets it on the display.\n\nUpdate: I've had this for almost a year now, and I'm experiencing some issues. The laptop is having issues booting and is showing the BIOS menu instead of booting windows 10. Furthermore, the audio port doesn't work anymore, after a windows 10 update. I tried updating the drivers but it didn't help. I treat my tech nicely so I'm going to say it was a failure on the part of the hardware. I don't know if it was caused by the installation of RAM, so I'm going to leave it at a 4 star rating."}

There's a door underneath the laptop that you just unscrew and put the RAM card in and it snaps in place and done! I instantly have 12GB of RAM now. To test the HD screen I logged into my NHL.TV account and streamed a game on there and there was no slow down, it was like watching it on TV, very crisp. I also added the amazon basics wireless mouse and it works great. I did have an issue getting connected to my home Wifi which was weird. I kept entering my password and the connection kept failing.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "Computer really isn't too bad for the price point, I would of gave this at least a 4 star rating if not for one major disappointing factor. The manufacturer swapped out the old screw which made it easy to access the laptops spare RAM slot for a solid screw (looks like a nail and cannot be removed with any screwdriver) therefore the ONLY way to even upgrade this laptops RAM for me was to physically pry off the plastic covering with a blade until it snapped off. Now the plastic cover is secured via electrical tape to keep it in place. Considering I only bought this because I wanted to upgrade its RAM based off countless reviews and find out  ASUS decided to make it difficult by replacing the screws earns this laptop a 3/5 in my book. Otherwise a good computer, at least I have 12 GB of memory now instead of 4...(actually about 3.5 if you don't plan on upgrading)"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "For the price of $375.00, this laptop actually runs extremely well.  After using it for about a week, I'm already happy that I had purchased this laptop.\nFirst off, I'd like to mention that I've installed a Samsung Evo 500GB SSD as well as another stick of 8GB RAM into the laptop and this runs a lot faster than my old laptop I had been using for four years up until now.  Boot up time went from 1 min to about 10-15 secs with no problems.  I'm currently in college, so this laptop is definitely beneficial as I've been using it constantly for coding as well as typing documents.  It's good for everyday use and I've found that it can handle continuous use on a battery charge for quite a while.  The longest it's handled without being charged was about 4 hours, which in my opinion, handles pretty well.  The computer itself runs well, I've had no problems with it slowing down on me, and it is extremely light.\n\nSo for this price:\n375 for the laptop,\n150 for the SSD\n35 for the 8GB RAM\n\nThis $560 laptop runs just as well as my old laptop, while definitely beating it in terms of speed.  If you're looking for something to game with however, this can only handle certain games at medium to medium high graphic settings. It will definitely not be sufficient enough for graphic intensive games like GTA V or Fallout 4 if you're aiming for 'ultra' settings in these games.  It can handle games like League of Legends however with around 40-50 fps.  The onboard graphics is more than enough to handle basic gaming so keep that in mind before purchasing this laptop.\n\nPros:\n2 USB 3.0 slots allows for faster transfer speeds\nExtremely light\nHD Screen (1920 * 1080 resolution)\nFull Sized Keyboard\nNice specs for a cheap price.\n\nCons:\nI'd like to point out that it only has one output for audio, and this is for your headphones.  If you're looking for another port for the microphones, you'll need to find an adapter to connect both inputs into as this does not have a microphone jack.\nThe keyboard is not backlit, and don't expect to be able to replace it for a backlit one.  It's not removable unless you take off the entire panel to change it out.\nHard to access the drive within. Screws are extremely easy to strip so be careful when taking out screws."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "I'm giving this 4 stars. However, if you add more RAM and a SSD as some reviewers have suggested, this is definitely a 5-star option. So, you need to decide whether it's worth the hassle of opening the computer and replacing RAM/HD for about additional $150 or so. This is a cool little project if you like to mess with gadgets (the reason I bought this). The upgrade items/procedure listed by one of the reviewers here seems to be accurate (thanks for sharing). I added 8 GB of RAM and a 250 GB Samsung SSD. This change does elevate this computer to $600-800 range in terms of performance. Given it comes with a good 1080p display, the upgrade is well worth, if you can DIY. Probably not worth if you plan to pay someone for this. If you plan to use the default configuration (i.e. 4GB RAM and a regular 5400 RPM HD) then you need to understand that the performance is somewhat sluggish, although useable in most day to day applications such as web browsing, e-mail, and word-processing applications."}

The only problem I have had with it is that the touch pad has stopped working twice, but I called tech support and they got it working again, They were wonderful. Even with the problem of the touch pad I still love the laptop, Starts up fast, so you are up and going and on line quick,for what I use it for it is perfect for me. I would recommend this laptop to anyone looking for a  reasonable price one. This would be great for kids to do school work on."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "I have had this unit for not quite two weeks now. So far I am quite satisfied with my purchase. Despite all the bad reviews I had very few problems setting it up. The free upgrade for Windows 10 installed flawlessly, although it ate up a lot of my data allowance. I was able to download Chrome and Firefox by disabling Windows Defender temporarily, so that is one fix for those having trouble doing the downloads.\n Since it doesn't have a media player driver without paying Microsoft for it, I downloaded the VLC media player for free which works quite well, in my opinion. The clarity of the screen is awesome. You can change the brightness by tapping notifications, selecting how bright you want it to be. Be warned the brighter you make it the more of the battery charge is used. I have found 50% is best for my needs.\n The system is a bit slow out of the box but I haven't done any upgrades yet, and for the price of the unit it is well worth the extra investment. Even better for me I happened to buy it a week before the price went up another $25.00.\n I have had no issues with the touch pad although it is quite sensitive, but I think practice will make make it easier. To me the keyboard seems very stable. Of course this is my first laptop so I have no other standard by which to compare it.\n I will be updating my review after I upgrade the hardware or if any issues arise. i would not hesitate to recommend this to potential buyers as of this date.\nED 02.12.2016\n\nEdit your review: Update: 04/03/2016 I have now had My  ASUS F555LA-AB31 15.6-inch Full-HD Laptop (Core i3, 4GB RAM, 500GB HDD) with Windows 10.for two months now and I am still thoroughly pleased with it. I have had no problems with it to date. I  upgraded the memory to have a total of 12 GB. I also upgrade to the newest Windows 10 version with ease. But be warned this version does not support Bluetooth. I don't know if there is a way around that yet but I'm not too concerned right now. I found it easy to learn the new OS after coming from years of windows 7. To me the clarity of the screen is good, even at 50% brightness. It is true that the viewing angle is not good, but it is only a minor inconvenience. I use a remote keyboard and mouse to save  wear and tear to the onboard touchpad and keyboard. I have not upgraded to a SSD yet because I'm hesitant to dig into the guts of the machine, but I have heard it's not much of a problem. I'll have to tighten up my courage before I attempt it. The speed for now is just fine for my purposes. The camera is only fair, but I'll live with it. Taking videos and photos is a snap. Finding them for upload is just as easy..I have come to love Windows 10 and my machine. I know there is better on the market, but for the price it's a good choice.\nI will keep updating as I learn more or if I have problems.."}

There are simply some websites that W10 will not allow you to go to. No button that says, yes I know the risk, take me there anyway. Nope, just cant go there. I think Yahoo.com was one of them and several others that my mom uses. The quality of the computer itself is really cheap. The keyboard is the flimsiest I have ever seen.

I was able to disable it when I first got this laptop, but apparently an update took that choice away. I tried numerous solutions but no go. As a result, typing is a nightmare on this thing. Lots of cussing going on. Next, the HD screen has lousy colors. I calibrated the color, tried enhancing it as much as possible, but the display just looks washed out. HD doesn't necessarily mean great color. Finally, the keyboard is strange. It has some wacky placement of different keys. As a result of those things, it will be going back. If anyone intends to buy one I would recommend upgrading the ram from 4 to 8 gig as well."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "If you're like me (and not extremely familiar with the i series of Intel processors), you might snub your nose at the i3. That's probably a mistake, especially at this point. These i3s(and the entire family) have come a long way since they were introduced to market. When they first came out an i3 was somewhere along the lines of an atom processor and only suitable for the bare minimum. Now, these are pretty great.\nThis 5010u model is ranked at 226 on this notebookcheck.net.\n226 might not sound great in your mind (but most processors above it are i7 or i5 and will probably cost you close to or more than 1k). 226 is more than enough for anyone but graphics editors or someone who expects to play fallout4 at 1920x1080p with AA at 4x on a laptop (even then the i3 wouldn't be your biggest bottleneck).\nMy 2012 Acer with A8-4500m is ranked 397, and while there isn't a huge real world difference, there is definitely some extra \"pop\" with the i3.\nI'm not sure that it will perform as well with games (I was able to play Civ V just fine on the A8), but that's not a big priority for me.\n\nThe \"package\" is much nicer than my old Acer. Sleeker, thinner, not the glossy (fingerprint magnet) finish, and a good bit lighter. Overall it's a very nice looking laptop in my opinion.\n\nBattery life seems fine to me. I was able to get 4 hrs and 20 minutes while streaming 1 half of a basketball game from WatchESPN, 2 hours of HD movie playback (from local HD), and 1 hour of general web browsing. I could've certainly eeked out more (I plugged it in when it was at 10 percent, and the brightness was at the unplugged default of 40 percent).\nI got about 5 hours after switching to SSD with the same type activities.\n\nBoth \"tests\" were with 12 gigs of Ram (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Kingston-HyperX-Impact-Black-8GB-1600MHz-DDR3L-CL9-SODIMM-1-35V-Laptop-Memory-HX316LS9IB-8/dp/B00KQCOTCM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Kingston HyperX Impact Black 8GB 1600MHz DDR3L CL9 SODIMM 1.35V Laptop Memory (HX316LS9IB/8)</a>)\n\nAs others have mentioned, the sound is definitely good for a laptop. I haven't had the issue where things are just slightly too quiet even on full blast with this machine. It's nice.\n\nThe cons are few but there.\nI'm not a fan of the touchpad. It sometimes doesn't seem to track quite right. That could've been due to greasy fingers or something. The tap to click (on the general trackpad) seems to register my tap only 90-ish percent of the time. And I just don't prefer the all smooth touchpads (the buttons are integrated with the trackpad). It makes it harder, for me at least, to know where I am without looking.\n\nI wasn't able to PXE boot (it might have been my server acting up), so I don't count that as a con quite yet - the option is there.\n\nI'm only connecting to my true 5ghz wireless N network at half the speed (150 instead of 300), but that's almost surely an issue with the drivers or OS.\n\nReplacing the HDD seemed like more of a pain than with past laptops, but I may just not be remembering correctly. Either way, it did involve removing all of the back screws, \"prying\" the keyboard off of the body, and disconnecting ribbon connectors to get to the bay. It wasn't more than a 15 minute job though.\n\nOverall, this is an EXCELLENT midlevel option.\nIt makes me feel even worse for my family members/friends that still go to best buy and get suckered in to a 800 dollar laptop that does the exact same thing just slower."}

Not sure why it didn't update it automatically as that was the setting.\nOne ding (otherwise it would get five stars): the charge cord is too short, about half what my older HP had. Not sure what the batter life will be, but it will most likely come in at what other reviewers say, about 4 hrs. Not sure where the battery is on this thing, either.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "This is a great computer. I am coming off of using a 4 core AMD processor, and even though this one is only dual core, it is much faster. The easy upgrade slot on the bottom is much appreciated. Granted I have no need to upgrade yet as I mainly use this computer for school. The screen looks great, viewing angles are satisfactory. I like that they put in a cd drive in it for some of the older media that is difficult to find to download. My only issue which I am slowly getting used to is the num pad on the keyboard is slightly smaller, but with time I am sure I will get used to it. If anything changes I will be sure to update this review.\n\n---------------update------------------\nI had to return the first one because the CD-Rom didn't function, this new one the CD-Rom functions properly, BUT there is an issue with the Wireless Adapter. I am a Certified Wireless Technician, and no matter what I do there is severe packet loss on Wi-Fi. Even when I plug in the Ethernet Cord I still get moderate packet loss; I also had this issue with the last laptop that was purchased. After speaking with Asus they say it is my ISP. The thing is I work for my ISP, and know what the actual issue is. So far even though I gave a glowing review for this Laptop, unless I figure something out I will keep the reduction to 2 stars since this wireless adapter in both models I have received has a bad wireless adapter."}

Using a purchased copy of \"Malwarebytes\" I found over 3,000+ malware or suspected PUPs related tags.  Now this is a brand new machine!  My suggestion, buy a copy of Malwarebytes along with this machine, you will need it.  The downside is Malwarebytes does not catch everything.\n\nWithin the past several days I have found more malware on the laptop.  My fear is how much personal information is being put out.  Because of this I have become aware that there is No Windows 10 system or recovery disk  I have also been through the box several times looking for documentation and have found nothing, not even an inspection tag.  An additional item, I use the HDMI port for my monitor.  It works periodically, but generally requires the monitor to be unplugged and plugged back into work.\n\nI have had the laptop for over a month.

I contacted ASUS Tech Support and after trouble shooting the issue was advised to send in the computer via RMA.  I sent my laptop in and it was returned to me less than two weeks later, however the resolution issue had not been fixed, the tech had merely reloaded windows 10 again and shipped it back to me.  The RMA technician also failed to return my AC Adapter with my laptop computer so when I received it back, i received a laptop with a dysfunctional LCD panel and no charger.  I called Asus fairly infuriated and they advised me to send this laptop back to them for a second RMA.  Although I was feeling drained and ready to simply buy another better laptop I agreed to send the laptop back to them again.  Asus contacted me a few days after their receipt of my laptop with a $210.00 invoice for damage to the LCD panel that apparently isn't covered by their 1 year warranty, as well as shipping costs and explained that I would have 3 days to pay them what is essentially 65% of the original purchase price of the unit or have the unit shipped back to me unrepaired.  I understand some other individuals on Amazon have had a positive experience with this product, however I am not one of them.  Asus Technical support have seemingly done everything in their power to break or lose the components to this laptop and want me to foot what is essentially the original cost of the unit in order to have it returned to me in functional condition.  I have called Asus Tech Support at least 15-20 times over the course of the last month and rather than resolving my problem they have made it worse.  If this thing worked properly, it might be a great deal, but if you have trouble with your unit do NOT EXPECT ASUS TO BE OF ANY HELP WITH THEIR WARRANTY/RMA service.  If I were you I would AVOID the purchase of this product.  I sure wish that I had."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "I needed a new laptop for general usage, and didn't want to spend a lot of money. I purchased the ASUS F555LA-AB31 for $350 not knowing what to expect due to the low price and some mixed reviews. After receiving and using it, I couldn't be happier. Out of the box, I could tell that the build quality isn't the greatest. But it was not unexpected, and I find it fine at this price point. Pretty much everything is plastic. On the plus side it makes this laptop lightweight. The keyboard and touchpad are \"OK\", but nothing special. The first thing I did before even booting the computer for the first time was install another 4GB of RAM. Installing it is simple as could be, and takes a minute. The 4GB included with laptop is not removable, and you can add up to another 8GB for a maximum total of 12GB. There is a reason I only added 4GB though. For best performance, I wanted all the RAM running in Dual Channel Mode. This is accomplished my making sure all the RAM installed is the same size and same speed. I purchased this SODIMM from Amazon for $20, and it works perfectly.&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Kingston-Technology-4GB-1600MHz-DDR3L-PC3-12800-1-35V-Non-ECC-CL11-SODIMM-Intel-Laptop-Memory-KVR16LS11-4/dp/B00CQ35GYE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Kingston Technology 4GB 1600MHz DDR3L PC3-12800 1.35V Non-ECC CL11 SODIMM Intel Laptop Memory KVR16LS11/4</a>&nbsp;I also confirmed with CPU-Z that the RAM is running in Dual Channel Mode. On the first boot, I carefully checked to make sure the display had no defects such as dead pixels or light bleeding. Mine was perfect. The FullHD 1090P display is bright and clear. It doesn't have the viewing angles or brightness of displays on much more expensive laptops, but It's the best display I've ever seen on a budget laptop. After booting, I let Windows 10 do it's thing and update to the latest build. After this was done, I checked the ASUS support page and updated a few drivers that were out of date. I'm impressed with the Intel Core i3-5010U 2.1GHz, Broadwell CPU. It's more than fast enough for me, and the HD 5500 Integrated Graphics is better than I expected. The 500GB 5400RPM isn't going to impress anyone, but again it was not as bad as expected. Windows boots in under 20 seconds, and everything loads in under a minute. I'm on the fence whether or not to replace it with an SSD, but for now I might just keep it. After spending a few hours tweaking Windows 10 and reinstalling all my software, I'm completely happy with the ASUS F555LA-AB31. It performs better than expected and I love the FullHD 1080P screen. I doubt I could find a better, more powerful laptop for the price."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "I noticed immediately on trying to use, that the main piece of plastic for the touchpad was oriented crooked with respect to the surrounding case.  The result was that the right-click didn't work -- or rather, sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn't.  I couldn't tell because there was no discernible click, just a kind of recalcitrant mush feeling.  And even when right click worked, it took many looonnng seconds to kinda/sorta pop back up.  It was clear that someone at the manufacturer had noticed this, because there was a little nick in the surrounding case plastic near the sticky corner, where someone had used some kind of tool to get it unstuck before it was shipped.  Fixed it just long enough to shove it out the door and collect my money -- hey, it's the Chinese way!  You don't actually expect it to work, do you?\n\nI had already returned another of these laptops, which had gotten completely crushed and obliterated in shipment -- I guess that's the UPS way.  Kudos to Amazon, though, for their painless-as-possible return policy, I really appreciated that.  I didn't want to go through another return cycle, so I used a sharp knife to shave down the edge of the crooked plastic touchpad.  I was successful, and the touchpad works fine now.  The result isn't exactly pretty, however, and serves as a daily reminder to me of Chinese manufacturing excellence.  Not!"}

The size wasn't a surprise- I chose it mainly for its large screen, which is HD quality and really nice.  Since I will primarily use it at home, I don't mind the size at all, and it's still light and thin enough to carry with me as needed.  I'm not a hardcore computer user- this is my first new machine in years.  But I still managed to swap out the stock hard drive with a solid state drive, which brought the boot time down to under 10 seconds.  Amazing.  It also required a ram upgrade, which was even simpler.  It has plenty of power and memory for just about anything I need to do- and at $350 it was a deal.  Some people don't seem to like the \"feel\" of the keyboard or the case, but frankly I don't mind.  The ridged outer case seems to catch a lot of dust and crumbs, so that's mildly annoying, but nothing I get bent out of shape about.  For under $400 you've got yourself a really nice machine."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "The reason I purchased this new notebook is because the battery on my previous five year old SONY laptop would no longer take a charge. I tried ordering a replacement battery from Amazon and it arrived dead. After much thought I decided in might behoove me to just buy a new computer and because the ASUS F555LA was considered a BEST BUY I went with it. I've only had the machine two days and for the price I'm very happy with it. HOWEVER even though I knew beforehand that the owner/user cannot replace the battery because it is internal, I figured how much could ASSUS charge a valued customer to change batteries? Well, I just called ASUS and I'll tell you how much....ready?....$330!!!!. The purchase price of this computer new from Amazon was $349.95 on 1/19/16. Granted one can always resort to plugging in the unit but the length of the power cord is rather short. So, if like myself, you like the ability to walk from room to room without plugging in the charger, you might want to consider a computer that allows you to replace the battery yourself. BTW when the ASSUS person I spoke to (who couldn't give me the overall life expectancy of the battery when asked) saw I was a bit peeved by the outrageous pricing of replacing the battery she said, \"But understand sir when your battery does die and you need to have us replace it, the cost might very well change and could possibly be cheaper than the current price I've quoted you\"....to what.....a mere $250.00!?!?!?! I was going to say, \"Yeah, but for that matter it might even increase in price\" but I decided instead to say my thanks and hung up."}

It's not touchscreen, but what kind of animal would want to mark up such a pretty screen with their greasy palms. Pro tip if you decide to upgrade your RAM: The panel on the bottom of the laptop needs to be opened and it's held in by a small plastic screw that looks nothing like a screw. It's a flat plastic circle with with no indentation what so ever. Use a screw driver to press down on the flat surface and unscrew it like any other screw...took me 10 minutes to figure that out. The user manual says nothing about it"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "*** Update to review about performance - I saw at least one person saying poor performance. The first day I got the laptop, I removed McAfee and a couple of other unneeded programs. I then installed free AVG Anti-Virus and their free trial of PC Tuneup. PC Tuneup will help you remove unneeded start-up programs and disable other programs that can affect performance. After this, we timed the laptop from powered off to windows sign-in page. It took 30 seconds. This is before adding memory and the ssd. One thing that will slow this down is Windows and other programs that are set for auto-update. If they find and download updates automatically, this can really slow down the boot up while they install updates. I turned off auto update for most software. The casual user probably shouldn't do this since it is important to keep security updates installed. After installing additional 8gb memory and ssd, laptop boots up in less than 5 seconds from power off.\n\n*** Update to battery performance. After about 3-weeks, I have discovered that I am getting 4+ hours even with the screen brightness turned up above the suggested power saving setting. The SSD may be helping some but still, the performance is very good. I am still very satisfied with the purchase. One tip to save battery power is to change what happens when you close the lid. You can find this setting by right clicking on the battery icon in the bottom right of the display. Select power options and then \"Choose what closing the lid does\". Changing this to hibernate while on battery power will save your open pages and programs to disk and turn off the computer. This saves a lot of battery instead of leaving the laptop in \"sleep\" mode. With the SSD, it only takes seconds to come back up. Sleep mode slowly drains the battery  since memory has to remain powered up.\n\n*** I keep looking at other models but I have yet to find one this good in this price range. None of the others I have been looking at have the 802.11ac wifi or the 1920 x 1080 screen. I recommend this laptop to my colleagues over all others for school, business, home, video use.\n\nI usually purchase the least expensive new laptop every few years that I use for business and home. This time I decided to do more research and go for the fastest home/business laptop but at a reasonable price. I found this laptop at $349 but ended up getting one that was listed as \"new\" with box damage for $309. It got here fast and although it looked like it had been handled, it looks and works like new.\n\nA couple of features that this laptop has that others in the price range don't are:\n** - the 802.11ac wifi (newest and fastest). Sometimes called \"Gigabit WiFi\", this new standard boasts throughput and data transfer speeds up to three times faster than 802.11n. If you want to have wifi that is the latest and fastest, be sure you get this. This is a feature that will keep this laptop current for the next few years. It is hard to find on others in this price range and even much more expensive. I have not once had the dreaded \"buffering\" delay in any video since I got this a couple of weeks ago.\n\n** - the HD 1920 x 1080 pixel display. This is considered full HD.Most others only have 1366X768 pixels. This one provides much sharper and clearer text and video. I plan on using this to watch Prime and Netflix videos. This is another feature that none of the other laptops in this price range had. If you plan on watching videos on your laptop, this is a very valuable feature.\n\nThese two features sold me on this laptop. I couldn't find these on others in this range. I wanted to make sure I bought the one that would last and not be outdated in a year or two. This was it and a couple of weeks later, I am really pleased.\n\nI also checked out the Core I3 processor and found that it was reasonably fast. In fact, faster than some older I5s and even I7s. Unless you are playing high-end games, this processor has more than enough power for Windows, Office, Turbo Tax, Quick Books, and other business programs.\n\nI also read the \" Thygesen \" review and info on adding memory and an SSD disk. Thank you  Thygesen. I ordered the parts he suggested. Everything worked fine except the disk enclosure. It is metal and has soldered connections on the disk connector that shorted against the case when the cover was installed. I had to use it without the case on it. I am returning it and purchasing the Inateck 2.5 Inch USB 3.0 Hard Drive Disk HDD External Enclosure. Here is the Amazon page: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DW374W4?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00.\n\nHere is a list of the parts I purchased for the 8gb memory and 250gb SSD:\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DW374W4?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00\nHD enclosure with USB 3.0 cable\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OAJ412U?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00\nSolid State Disk SSD 250 GB -Samsung 850 EVO 250GB 2.5-Inch SATA III Internal SSD\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KQCOTCM?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00\n8 GB memory - Kingston HyperX Impact Black 8GB 1600MHz DDR3L CL9 SODIMM 1.35V Laptop Memory  (4 GB is only $23.50 and is enough for most business users)\n\nAnd a carrying case with shoulder strap that had good reviews for $19.75 - http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007AB9JK4?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00  Case Logic 15.6-Inch Laptop Case\n\nThe Laptop was already fast out of the box but is really much faster with the extra 8gb memory (12gb total) and the SSD. I should warn you that replacing the original hard disk with the SSD is a bit nerve wracking on your new laptop. There is a good video on youtube that shows this but you should be aware that the thin ribbon cables for the keyboard and mouse pad are fragile and a bit tricky to undo and re-attach. I thought I had broken them when I opened the case and the two cables pulled loose after raising the keyboard cover. There is no typical connector on these. They just lay flat and have to be clipped into place on the board and cover. The latch is tiny. Be sure that you have the latch open - slide the cable with the exposed wiring down into the connector - then carefully push the latch closed.  Here is the youtube video: [...] - Use a credit card as shown to undo the clips on the case after removing the screws. It works well and won't damage the edges like a screwdriver. I found it easiest to start by the cd player and go all the way around carefully and slowly.\n\nAdding memory is easy. Just be sure that you remove the plastic cover from the top of the screw and open the memory cover on the back. The screw cover needs to be pulled off carefully. It isn't like the rubber covers that come off and can be replaced. You scratch and lift it off and throw away. The memory goes in at a 45% angle and then you push it down until it clicks. Make sure you have it all the way into the connector with the keyed opening or slot in the correct position before pushing down. 12 GB is all you can put in the system since the original 4 GB seems to be soldered in.\n\nOne more thing to be aware of is the software that the Samsung SSD comes with. The CD in the box has an older version (2.6 or 2.7) that will not work on Windows 10. Go to the Samsung site and download the 3.0 version. It works great. It will copy the hd to the ssd in about 10 minutes. You can use their Magician software to make changes to the OS that will speed up the SSD even more after installation<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/ASUS-F555LA-AB31-15-6-inch-Full-HD-Laptop-Core-i3-4GB-RAM-500GB-HDD-with-Windows-10/dp/B011KFQASE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">ASUS F555LA-AB31 15.6-inch Full-HD Laptop (Core i3, 4GB RAM, 500GB HDD) with Windows 10</a>.\n\nOne benefit of doing the ssd upgrade is now having the original drive as an external hard disk. It still has all the data on it and should be a good backup for the OS and bootable. I did encounter a couple of problems when attaching the HD through the USB. The drive came up as \"read only\" and there was a drive letter conflict(two c: drives). I fixed the drive letter problem by right clicking the start icon in the lower right corner and selecting \"Disk Management\". I was able to put it online and the drive letter changed to d:.. I still had a problem with the disk being read-only. The only way I was able to fix this was with \"diskpart\". Google this and you will find how to change the attribute to read/write.\n\nThe only \"con\" I have for this laptop is the fact that the battery is stored inside and not removable like most laptops. I suspect that this will become more common as batteries get more reliable and last longer. After several weeks, I am getting around 3+ hours on battery. It would be longer but I prefer my screen brighter than the power saving setting so I turn this up. If you use the recommended power saving settings, you should be able to get 4-5 hours. I work with battery operated equipment for my job and batteries are getting better. Lithium batteries are now lasting 4-5 years so I hope that it what I will see in this laptop. The battery can be replaced but you will have to open the case to do it. If it does last 5 years, that will be great and it will be time for a new laptop or some other device by then.\n\nSO, I got a great laptop. Upgraded the memory and disk drive to an ssd for around $150 and even have the original 500gb hd as an external drive. Cost - about $450. Great deal and this is a product that should last for 5 years. I definitely recommend it. The only thing I would say it needs out of the box is at least 4gb more memory. It uses 2-3 gb just for the operating system and a couple of web pages open. 4 GB more memory is around $23. Since you can add 8gb more for only about $40 bucks, that is probably the way to go."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "This laptop is a great deal for college students or general internet useage. This is in NO WAY a laptop to be used for gaming. This laptop shows that it has a lot of desireables including the Intel i5 (2.1Ghz) processor, Windows 10 64-bit, integrated HD 5500 graphics and 4GB of RAM. Saying that, it acts sluggish when bringing programs up and starting up in general. This observation may be due to the fact that my desktop computer has a SSD hard drive which is lightning fast when opening the OS and any programs on it. I do not know if it is the programs that come installed on the computer I will be eliminating them systematically.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "Great laptop for your money I highly recommend it for the college kid like myself and light gamer. It can run League and terraria fine. It can also run mw2 and csgo at 60 fps if the graphics are tuned down.\n\nA major pro that is nice about this laptop is that it boots really quick even from being completely turned off the bios time is 3-4 seconds and windows loading takes 20-30 seconds to get to desktop. When i'm at school with the fully charged battery and turn it on battery saver, the battery will last well over 6 hours.\n\nCons: The camera on this laptop is absolute garbage. Nothing else to add to that, it just sucks. The keys are not back lit. Doesent come with a mic&headphone port, there is just one port for both.  I'm happy that the screen isn't shiny reflective but the screen looks cheap. One more thing, it says the laptop model is X555LAB if i check in computer properties.\nThere is one thing that doesn't matter much but i'm just gonna mention it. The sides of the laptop are black and not silver like it shows in all of the pictures. I think it probably would've looked better on the appearance of it but it's not that big of deal."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "\"SonicMaster clear and powerful sound\" my foot. The sound quality emitting from this laptop is horrible and I have tried adjusting every sound setting in order to fix it yet it still sounds bad. I have an older ASUS of similar price and the sound quality is so much better on it. The sound on this one is hollow and there is a crinkling noise on the left side of the computer that is especially prominent whenever a singer hits a high note. Also, I can't get the volume to go up any higher so when I have my headphones on the sound is very quiet to what I am used to hearing and I've used these same headphones with my other ASUS with no problems so its not an issue with the headphones. Instead of improving things I see ASUS is decreasing quality with each new product and what's worse is that they are claiming its better by labeling it \"SonicMaster\"! I put the same song on both laptops to test them and this ASUS F555LA-AB31 sounds thin and far away as opposed to the rich sound from my older laptop.\n\nAnother problem is that it gets stuck loading webpages with a lot of pictures. It's not an internet issue or firefox issue because I haven't ever had this problem on my other laptop. It will freeze and it won't ever unfreeze so you have to close the window. I'm very disappointed and surprised by the good comments this computer has so I felt I had to post a review for this product so you know what you are getting."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "I was wary after reading many negative reviews on this product. However, the issues reported for the most part seem to be usability preferences more than problems with the actual product. I found the mouse pad perfectly adequate. I do not think the keyboard is crunchy. The plastic does not make this laptop feel cheap, it makes it feel lighter and easier for transport. The CD drive is pretty standard for a laptop and seems no more delicate or breakable than other laptops I have used. The sounds and screen quality is great for a laptop at this price point. I had no issues adding Chrome, updates, or setting up. I like ASUS and have had a good experience with this brand in the past and am not disappointed now. For the price and functionality this laptop is a great deal."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "*UPDATE 27th feb 2016*\nI've figured out the problem in the laptop as to the reason why it was not starting, so i've decided to share if anyone has similar problems.\n\nIf after a while your laptop has died or it came DOA. look at the bottom right of the laptop where the lights are. If you press the power button and the lights come on as usual and the screen flickers a little bit, but still won't turn on, then the motherboard has excess charge in it.\n\nIn a situation like this, get a screwdriver and remove the 10 screws on the bottom of the laptop. This loosens the keyboard section of the laptop but it will still be held into position by clips.\n\nStarting from the top right and top left, gently pull up and undo the clips right around the laptop. work your way around the laptop until all clips are undone. BE CAREFUL THOUGH. There are two connectors connecting the keyboard and the touchpad to the laptop. These must be removed before the keyboard section comes off completely.\n\nAfter removing the keyboard undo the 3 screws on the battery and remove the battery. press and hold the power button for an entire minute (this removes the excess charges that are in the motherboard) when this is finished, plug in the power adapter in the laptop and power it on (do not replace the battery as yet). If the laptop powers on, you've remedied the problem\n\nSo now i still have this great laptop with all my work, no complains anymore. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for an amazing budget laptop.\n*END OF UPDATE*\n\n*UPDATE 23rd feb 2016*\nIt has been a month and a half (bought this around the 8th Jan) and now it will not turn on. It cut off randomly on me (it was plugged in so it's not the battery or the cord) and now it will not even start.\n\nWhen pressing the power button, the lights flash and only 2 remain on. Those 2 are the power and the battery charging lights. The hard drive light does not blink at all. And when i press and hold the power button to power the machine off.. The 'click' youd here from the harddrive is not there. This indicates a faulty motherboard as it no longer accesses the hard drive. As a college student (computer science major) with tons of assignments due in the upcoming weeks I'm at a loss here because now I do not have a usable machine which I can use to do my assignments.\n\n***End of update***\n\nThis laptop is amazing. Out of the box was a feeling of a premium laptop. The screen quality is OUT OF THIS WORLD.\nThe full 1080p screen is an amazing upgrade from normal laptops with 768p screens and the matte screen allows for users to use the screen in the light without much glare.

It's always zooming in and all this crap\n- Windows 10 is far from a perfect OS and is pretty buggy. The laptop is 2 months old and I'm already having issues with random errors and it shutting off. As well as wifi connectivity issues. I'm extremely displeased w/ this.\n- The laptop has a really cheap feel to it. Probably best left on your desk, I'm too scared it'll break if I regularly take it with me to school.\n\nMy final verdict is this: It's probably better to invest in a more quality laptop. This one makes for a nice budget laptop, but it's cheap for a reason. And if I could go back I would probably buy something better. And personally, I'm not confident how long this machine will last, and if it doesn't last long then its low buy price isn't worth it."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "I bought this for $299 at the best buy store. So far this laptop is pretty nice. Very gorgeous and cool looking with the black keys and silver background. It comes with windows 10 already installed, windows 10 is okay so far. When you first start up it takes like 10 minutes to get all signed in and the laptop runs some updates then you can finally explore. I did have the problem with opening the computer tonight and it took like 5 minutes just to log in because the welcome to windows 10 screen started loading as if I opened this brand new...but when it finally loaded my home screen all my stuff was still there.\n\nThe worst flaw on this machine is DEFINATLY the mouse pad. Its really stupid and doesn't move very good. I wish the left and right buttons were raised so that there is separation. Also the mouse pad doesn't work good on the right side. I have a wireless mouse I use anyways. Ill update in a few months if my view changes."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "This computer is everything I expected it to be and more for being in the sub-$400 laptop zone. I received the laptop in less than appropriate packing from the seller (Amazon) which allowed it to be jostled about in transit. The delivery box, however, was not damaged so I wasn't overly concerned. When I got to the actual manufacturer's packaging for the laptop itself, I was very pleased to find it quite robust and sturdy.\n\n  Laptop was came out of box gleaming and has a nice style for the price range. I plugged the laptop in before its first initial boot (per Asus's recommendation in user manual) and it started up immediately after turning power button. Once I got through the initial setup, I took it for a spin.\n\n  Obviously for this price range, the laptop did not come with all the goodies a $1000 laptop would such as Microsoft Office or an upgraded graphics card (really, you're going to ask if you can play CSGO on a sub $400 laptop?). I had no problem with any of this since I researched what I bought before I bought it, and knew exactly what I was getting for less than $400.\n\n  What this laptop can do very right out of the box is giving you a fast internet browser, an HD screen, and the option to add applications like Office later which is nice. I like and appreciate expandability. Inter\n\nGive this laptop a try if you are in the market for a budget laptop with good features and quality from a reputable company."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "I hope that I'll be upgrading this to a 4 star soon, but I'm a little hesitant. I just booted it up for the first time last night and started loading things onto it, like Norton AntiVirus and Office -- apparently the computer couldn't handle both downloads at once because it froze up. I restarted it but to no avail -- I kept getting the blue screen reboot failure and tried everything else before finally just wiping the system and restoring it from scratch. On the second go 'round, I decided not to test it by downloading both at once again, but instead did each separately. So far, so good... I can't imagine that downloading both of those rather large items would cause such a disaster and require a complete wipe of my system, but maybe the slowdown triggered something else wonky. Hmm. Like I said, so far so good and other than minor qualms like the keyboard being a bit loud and cheap feeling (but works fine), I'm hopeful that it will be smooth sailing from here!\n\nGlad I didn't have to call up ASUS to troubleshoot!\n\n----------------UPDATE June 2016----------------\n\nI'm keeping it at 3 stars. First off, the battery and sleep functions are weird.... I swear the sleep function doesn't properly work on this computer but I'm not sure how to fix it. It SHOULD mostly turn \"off\" and use only a liiiiittle battery while unplugged and asleep. Instead, even if I've put it to sleep and it was on full power, if I unplug it then the next time I turn on my computer (which may just be that next morning), sure enough, the battery warning sign is flashing. Argh!! Not a dealbreaker but very annoying to have to plug in so often.\n\nSecond, every 3-4 times I wake it from sleep, it takes about 10 minutes to get up and running with my same browser tabs I had opened before putting it to sleep. Maybe another thing that's wrong with the Sleep mode? I'm not sure.\n\nThird, sometimes the keyboard doesn't register when I'm trying to click on something which is more annoying than really a deal breaker, but still.\n\nMy previous ASUS was so wonderful, and I'm pretty disappointed in this one. I'm keeping it at 3 stars rather than 2 because when it doesn't have those Sleep or keyboard issues, it's a nice computer. I like the extended keyboard, the quality of video, and sound. After the first issue with Windows 10 on the computer, I haven't had any system failures like that since then."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "A loose screw was found in the laptop upon unpackaging it from the box.  We could hear this simply by shaking the machine lightly before first power-on.  It is unclear where this screw came from but it appears to be missing from the heatsinks tiedown or harddrive bay.  The screw is small in length and not used for structure.  However, had we not checked for foreign objects in the computer before power-on it could have created a pretty sizeable short, effectively ruining the laptop.\n\nThe laptop powered on after removal of the screw (we did this by removing all exterior structure screws, minus the one that breaks the warranty.  This gave just enough room for it to fall out).  However after this, on first power-on, we noticed the top part of the screen was ALSO damaged.\n\nOverall -- We had TWO separate, major defects on this computer that should have been easily caught in quality.  We are calling ASUS to figure out a \"prompt\" return.\n\nAs a side note, I also received a separate ASUS laptop a couple months ago (direct from ASUS's online store) that will filled with paper.  Apparently someone in their packaging department stole the laptop.  Talk about a literal month of fixes to get that sorted out.\n\nASUS is on the way down.  Be careful in purchasing an ASUS computer while their quality control is asleep."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "What I like: 1) SD card slot. These are not as ubiquitous as they once were, and at this price point its a big plus for me. 2) One easily upgradable RAM slot. I mean, having one at all is a plus, but one that is easy to get into is a big plus. 3) 1920x1080p resolution. At this price point and well above, most screens are not Full-HD. This one displays crisp text and decent color. 4) VGA port. The VGA port gives this machine a much wider range of backwards compatibility with older external displays and projectors. 5) HDMI port. Current and future compatibility with external displays and projectors. 6) Ethernet port. Very happy this port is there, and for my uses of this machine it is very important. Connecting to secure networks is possible. (WiFi is NEVER secure, period.) AND if you were to use it for some light gaming its a plus too. 7) Its bloody light to carry it is.\n\nWhat I don't like: 1) No indicator lights for capslock OR numlock. AWE COME ON MAN! This one omission almost, ALMOST, made me send it back; only the absolute basic human interface on this machine. 2) Keyboard is spongy and springy. It must be the least expensive way to build a keyboard, which is what this machine is all about anyway. 3) Very flimsy feeling CD/DVD tray. Again, \"just functional\" is what this machine is about. 4) Screen has a very narrow angle of view. Again, not surprising and not a deal breaker at this price point but, I don't like it. 5) No physical buttons for WiFi/Bluetooth/Volume, or anything else. 6)Battery life isn't long enough for two Netflix movies over WiFi. From full battery I watched \"A Christmas Carol,\"  and the very beginning of \"The Ridiculous 6,\" BUT we shouldn't expect more than that at this price point. A person may not get a full day of college classes of typing out notes in Microsoft Office (especially the Cloud-based version). Extend your battery life by taking notes with Wordpad, Notepad, LibreOffice, or OpenOffice, and possibly Microsoft Office installed locally -- with the screen brightness turned down as low as you can stand it, and make them pretty with whatever you like later. If you really want longer battery life expect to pay much more for the machine. Machines in this price range and many above it just don't have fantastic battery life. If long duration \"off the mains\" operation is of high importance to you, this machine is not it.\n\nNote: To extend your battery life of any \"connected\" device, turn off (disable in Windows) wireless technologies such as WiFi, Bluetooth, and cellular network connections when you don't need them or aren't using them. Also, be cautious of the power drain on USB connected devices if you are trying for longer battery life.\n\nIn closing: I Started my career designing and testing network hardware back in the 80's. I currently specialize in computer hardware and operating systems. -- Laptops below the $1500 point as of this writing compromise many things to be in the low price niche. There are just a few laptops that can claim all day work off the mains. With that in mind this particular machine does a great job for what it is. It is not a heavy graphics workhorse, it is not a gaming powerhouse, it is not a 12-hours-off-the-mains toiler. With the above notations, it is a light to medium duty beauty at $350. Even then, I would be willing to pay $50 more for a back lighted keyboard and capslock/numlock indicators."}

It is small and petty issue but a big deal as I've never seen a PC without a CAPLOCKS light before. When I first powered the PC on and going through the initial setup I couldn't log into the wireless network. I then realized i had no idea if I was in all CAPS or not. It's very small issue but very frustrating, I had to pull up notepad and type just to see if I'm in CAPS or not. Also I wasn't very impressed with the laptop charger, might be nothing wrong with it but it doesn't look like a standard laptop charger but more like a power cord for a DVD player. On the good side this thing powered up and has run really smooth from the get go. Easy to hit keyboard with bit buttons and a wide screen. For the Price it is definitely worth it IMO."}

Just a forewarning to anyone who has purchased or is thinking about purchasing. I'm scaling back to 4 stars because other than that this has still been a very nice laptop."}

Perfect laptop for home use. Initial booting takes some time though. The speaker is located at the bottom of the laptop which is not a problem if it is used in a desk.

Asus box is placed in larger nondescript cardboard box with some packing paper placed on top. It would of been better to pack with packaging peanuts but oh well.\nSCREEN:\nSome reviewers have been writing that the HD screen is dull but that's what you get with a MATTE SCREEN! Most consumer laptops come with a gloss screen which is great for vibrant colors but for long term computer use, a matte screen is best for reduced eye strain. Albeit, the colors are more subdued but its still FULL HD!! But again, this emphasizes the value that you get from this computer. Matte screens are generally found on costlier business laptops for professionals who stare at a screen a lot.\nNO BLU-RAY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SCREEN:\nKeep in mind, you won't be able to enjoy Full HD DVD movies since the DVD player is NOT Blu-ray. But you can enjoy full HD movies if you're using online movie resources such as Netflix and the like.\nPROGRAMS:\nThere's very little junk software loaded on the laptop which I prefer. There's Evernote, Dropbox, and Web Storage. But that's ALL there is. Tried to play a DVD but there's no Windows Media Player! It costs $15 from the App Store! But not to worry. There are excellent and not to mention, FREE alternatives. I downloaded VLC Player. You'll have to download it directly from their site and not the App Store. There's some downside when you download it from the App Store but I can't remember what it was right now.\n\nHOW-TOs:\nDIY How to install memory.\n1. Locate small cover on bottom of laptop.\n2. There is one screw on that cover that has a black sticker on top. Use flathead screwdriver to pry up the sticker.\n3. Remove screw using Phillips screwdriver and lift cover.\n4. Pop in RAM. Put the cover back on. Put screw back in. Put sticker back on.\n5. Verify BIOS to verify that it bumped up to 12GB. If not, then make sure RAM is seated properly in motherboard.\n\nDIY How to check BIOS + bump up graphics memory.\n1. Turn on computer.\n2. PRESS and HOLD \"SHIFT\" button and then shut down the computer. Once computer is off, let go of \"SHIFT\" button.\n3. PRESS and HOLD \"F2\" button and then PRESS Power button to start computer. DO NOT let go of F2 button until BIOS screen pops up.\n4. Under the MAIN tab, it should show Memory Information- Total Memory as 12288MB. Yay!\n5. While you're here, bump up the shared graphics memory to 512MB. Go to ADVANCED tab, Go down to graphics and then select 512.\n6. Press \"F10\" to save and exit.\n\nDIY How to Clone Your SLOW hard drive stuff to your NEW FAST hard drive.\nI had some problems with this one. Thought I could use the external hard drive enclosure and the Samsung Software included with the SSD to clone. But the Samsung software does not recognize the hardware on the enclosure. You would need a direct USB to SATA III cable to connect to the SSD. Instead, I downloaded the CNET recommended free \"Macrium Reflect\" software and cloned the harddrive using that. Success!\n\nDIY How to Replace old hard drive with SSD.\nGo to Youtube \"Asus F555L Disassembly for Hard Disk Replacement\" and follow instructions. Keep screws in order because the lengths are different. Otherwise, you'll have difficulty figuring out which length screw goes into which hole. This is easily avoided if you place them on a clean table in a similar arrangement as they came out.\nI broke a few clips on the keyboard cover while removing so be prepared. This would probably have to be the only negative part about this process. Make sure to flip up the locking clips before yanking out the ribbon cables.\n\nResults:\n1. I've definitely noticed faster boot time. I want to say its maybe around 5-10 seconds before you're up and running.\n2. Programs open faster.\n3. Of course you can now open more windows and run more programs simultaneously but I haven't tested this to its limit.\n4. Boosting graphics memory probably helps but haven't noticed a difference since its new anyway.\n5. Happiness since I probably would have had to spend $500 more to get something comparable to this. :)  Total spent is about $460.\n\nENJOY!!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "I purchased this laptop for a very specific purpose which is to run Wireshark and Nmap on Fedora 23. The items that were important to me were:\n\n1: 15+inch and 1920x1080 resolution\n2: 10/100/1000 network interface\n3: 8GB RAM minimum\n4: USB3\n5: Intel i3+ processor\n6: ability to run Fedora 23, Wireshark, Nmap and RealVNC client\n7: ability to sleep/wake with lid closing/opening in Fedora 23 without screen freezing\n\nThe first thing I did was to go through the default setup to finish the Windows installation. Then I selected to make a USB backup of the system. I chose to include everything so I can restore back to original condition if need be. This required an 8GB+ USB stick. I'll never use Windows and only created the USB as a fail safe if I need to return the machine.\n\nI then rebooted into the BIOS and set the video ram to 512MB, it's on 32MB by default. Next I booted from a Fedora 23 USB stick and went through the installation. On first start Fedora 23 prompted me for my Wi-Fi connection and password, then connected with no issues. This surprised me. I hadn't added any repo's yet and expected issues with the Wi-Fi setup. I had no such issues. Everything worked out of the box using Fedora-Live-Workstation-x86_64-23-10.iso with GNOME3. No need to compile wireless drivers or add rpmfusion to get up and running. Nice.\n\nAs for the quality of the laptop itself, it's very important to remember the cost of this laptop and that it has a 1920x1080 display resolution. There has to be trade-offs at this price. The trade-off for the FullHD resolution is a very poor viewing angle. For me this is not an issue. The text is crisp, clear and has good contrast. There is quite a bit of light bleed around the edges. Again, for me this is not an issue. It might be for you. This is not a high quality display and it's not marketed as one. If I had spent another two hundred on it, I wouldn't find the display acceptable.\n\nAs for the hard-drive, it's no speed demon, but it's fine. I'll probably rip the back off (that YouTube video makes me cringe) and throw in an SSD at some point.\n\nAt home I use a mechanical keyboard and at work I use an Apple keyboard. This one won't bother me. It's acceptable.\n\nI think Asus did a fine job on this three hundred and thirty dollar laptop and I only have 2 things I \"wish\" they had done differently. I wish they had left the DVD drive back in 2012 where it belongs. I haven't used a DVD in well over 3 years. DVD is dead and it's a break point on this machine. Every time I pick it up I feel it, it's going to break off at some point. I realize with the FullHD display and DVD drive it makes it more preferable to the target market. In fairness I'm not the target market.\n\nMy other \"wish\" would be a back-lit keyboard. I work in a lot of dark area's and for the most part the light from the display is enough, but it would have been a nice touch. Other than that I can't complain, I consider this to be a pretty ideal machine for what I need it for.\n\nLike several other reviewers I purchased the extra 8GB of RAM.12GB RAM will be overkill for my needs but RAM is cheap. Installation was simple, less than 60 seconds.\n\nThe ease of installation with Fedora 23 tells me I bought the right machine for my needs."}

I had to put my ear directly to the fan area to even hear the purring.\nIt moves quickly, and I've had a bit of fun with the Cortana feature for Windows 10.\nThe laptop is very slim, and doesn't seem to have any problems. I'm a photographer on the side, as well as a gamer.\nI've been uploading photos left and right, and the computer hasn't slowed down.\nThough I haven't had the chance to play more detailed games, I've casually played League of Legends on this computer in the highest quality possible.

I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the screen and the keyboard while not lit, gets things done for work.\n\nThe only negative thing it has is that the hard drive it comes with is kind of slow even for a mobile drive. That's where they probably saved the most money. Not a big deal unless you use a lot of apps that are memory hungry and your page file starts to get used. If that is the case, do yourself a favor and order more RAM if you don't want to tinker with the SSD (it's a bit hard to replace)\n\nFor a work laptop that will be going to sleep vice powering on and off, pretty solid. If you're looking for a mobile entertainment computer you are better off with their newer models that include SSDs."}

Not a touchscreen, so almost no need to clean it.\n-Keyboard is relatively quiet and easy to clean.\n-Mouse pad left and right clicks are together with the pad itself, mostly maintenance free.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "If you are looking for an affordable laptop for basic use, this is a very good buy. I would recommend it to anyone who needs a laptop for typically everyday use: surfing the web, streaming movies or music,c basic use programs (ie. Microsoft Office), or any other activity that doesn't require heavy processing power.\n\nOne of the main draws is the screen. For a laptop with this price tag you don't expect a crisp 1080p screen. Which makes this laptop perfect for streaming a movie if you are stuck somewhere while traveling. The battery life is usually around four to five hours as long as you aren't doing something performance heavy which is respectable, especially for this price tag.\n\nThe only problem I have with this laptop would be the touch-pad. It feels very cheaply made. I wouldn't expect it to be super high quality but it still has to be functional. I find it hard to move the cursor sometimes and the sensitivity can vary. Sometimes a light breeze will cause it to click, and sometimes you have to push really hard for it to register. The buttons on the touch-pad are incredibly loud which can be very annoying.\n\nWith that being the only problem I have with this laptop I would definitively recommend this laptop if you are looking for something cheap."}

The full HD monitor is unfortunately rather shoddy, with incredibly poor viewing angles and washed-out colors. The black levels are laughable. There is quite a bit of light bleed, which is especially noticeable when watching movies. It seems to handle most mundane tasks with ease, however, and handled some cursory attempts at multitasking pretty well. NO issues with wi-fi or touchpad, like others have mentioned. The biggest disappointment is definitely the monitor, which is really nothing special. If you're used to an IPS, this will definitely underwhelm. All-in-all, not bad."}

I did a lot of research and literally spent 2 months searching for the best laptop in my price-range for my daughter. Everything about this one looked promising. My daughter needs it for school, not gaming so I didn't think we were asking to much of it. Unfortunately, every time she tries to connect to our Wi-Fi, it fails to connect.  The only times we have been able to connect are when we make the computer forget the connection and manually reset it.  Even then if she walks away from the computer for awhile, even leaving it open, the connection is lost and she has to start all over again to connect. This is not a viable solution and should not be necessary. This has been going on since the first day. My son builds computers and is studying comp sci in college and he finally said that the computer is a lemon. We have 5 other laptops in the house and none of them has problems connecting, even the 5 year old one.  So I know the problem isn't our Wi-Fi. To be clear, this happens even when none of the other computers are connected (we tried that out to see). This leaves this computer useless for her needs.\n\nTo be fair, I haven't yet tried to contact Asus about the warranty. I can only hope that it will be as good as it seems in the product description.

After reading pages of reviews and doing what research I could on this product, I ordered a 250gb Samsung SSD, a 8gb stick of RAM, a SATA to USB 3.0 cord (I didn't have one or a dock already), and an empty aluminum case to place the new hdd in for a new external drive. With these upgrades and paying close attention to detail when doing the SSD, I don't see how this laptop could be short of awesome, except if your a hardcore gamer and need the faster FPS. CANT WAIT! Will update soon!\nHere are the links to the additional products I ordered:\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Samsung-850-EVO-250GB-2-5-Inch-SATA-III-Internal-SSD-MZ-75E250B-AM/dp/B00OAJ412U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Samsung 850 EVO 250GB 2.5-Inch SATA III Internal SSD (MZ-75E250B/AM)</a>\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Kingston-HyperX-Impact-Black-8GB-1600MHz-DDR3L-CL9-SODIMM-1-35V-Laptop-Memory-HX316LS9IB-8/dp/B00KQCOTCM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Kingston HyperX Impact Black 8GB 1600MHz DDR3L CL9 SODIMM 1.35V Laptop Memory (HX316LS9IB/8)</a>\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/StarTech-com-USB-3-0-to-2-5-34-SATA-III-Hard-Drive-Adapter-Cable-w-UASP-SATA-to-USB-3-0-Converter-for-SSD-HDD-Hard-Drive-Adapter-Cable/dp/B00HJZJI84/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">StarTech.com USB 3.0 to 2.5\" SATA III Hard Drive Adapter Cable w/ UASP - SATA to USB 3.0 Converter for SSD/HDD - Hard Drive Adapter Cable</a>\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Sabrent-Ultra-Slim-USB-3-0-to-2-5-Inch-SATA-External-Aluminum-Hard-Drive-Enclosure-Silver-Aluminum-Finish-EC-UM30/dp/B00MQ97QGE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Sabrent Ultra Slim USB 3.0 to 2.5-Inch SATA External Aluminum Hard Drive Enclosure [Silver Aluminum Finish] (EC-UM30)</a>\n\n**UPDATE**\n\nReceived everything on time and as described. Let me begin by saying that the whole process of upgrading the computer was seamless with these products. Here is what I did or observed during the process:\n1. Unboxed everything and checked for obvious signs of damage. Plugged the PC in, went through the setup process that new pc's entail.\n2. Desktop was super clean, no bloatware and crap no one needs, just the recycle bin.\n3. I had a USB stick with music and video on it and tested each USB port by playing music or video, the speakers, volume controls (both keyboard and tray icon), HDMI output (which I had to dumb down the resolution in order to get the screen to properly fit on my 40\" 720p Samsung HDTV), headphone jack, and dvd/cd tray open/close operation (which seems a little flimsy). Tested all the keys to make sure they work.\n4. Shut PC down then installed the extra 8g stick of RAM through the only hatch on the bottom of the PC.\n5. Turned back on, looked up system info to verify 12g RAM exists\n5. Downloaded the software onto the pc that came with the Samsung SSD, which involves 2 utilities, Magician and Data Migration. The Migration utility will need to be updated (it prompts you to do so)\n6. Hooked up the new SSD with the USB to SATA cable and opened the Migration software. Both drives come up, the HDD as source disk, and the SSD as the Target disk. Press START to start the clone process. There is a prompt warning that the target disk data will be erased.\n7. It was slow to start at first, so walked away and came back 3 mins later and it was 90% done. There was about 25 gigs of files copied.\n8. The program prompts you to shut down the PC, unplug the SSD, then install it. I looked \"ASUS F555L ssd upgrade' and watched a short youtube video how to get into the PC. (PAY ATTENTION) It was fairly straightforward and not too much of a challenge but you could do damage to some sensitive wiring if not careful. NOTE* You do NOT need to remove the extra RAM installed or the screw to that hatch to get the PC apart.\n9. Installed the SSD and restarted the computer. Booted to log screen in 3 seconds, maybe faster. SICK.\n10. Open the Magician utility and run the optimizer for whichever setting you chose. I chose Performance.\n11. After that I did the normal removal of apps and programs I won't use, like the Twitter app and Candy Crush Sage, did some downloading and copying of files from my external harddrive (a few pics and about 40g of music, which I am going to put on a USB 128g Cruzer Fit once it arrives.\n\nI was surprised how easy the upgrading was. I'm no beginner but the steps involved certainly can be done by one. Everything is working so fast. I am very pleased with the sound, despite some other users comments about it sucking. It may not blare like desktop speakers, but the depth of sound is fantastic and I am again very pleased. The keyboard markings are a little darker which makes them harder to see in lower light and the number pad keys aren't as big as the normal keyboard keys which, working with Excel a lot, kinda sucks for me, but purely my own preferences. The screen is beautiful and bright, and yes, sometimes you have to adjust the screen by pulling or push it back to get the best view.\n\nThe only thing that did not work for me was when I hooked the HDD, the one I took out of the new pc and replaced with the SSD, into the external case, then connected it to the pc, it will not recognize the drive. So I will troubleshoot that and hopefully can use that eventually as a backup drive.  ***UPDATE*** was getting an error that the drive is having a collision with a signature drive that is online so youtubed that as well and its a simple fix with a few clicks. Can fully use the HDD as an external, but make sure you separate those windows files (i.e. place in a new folder) on the 'old' HDD from any new files you store on the disk.\n\nOverall, I was skeptical about spending the money and tearing into a brand new computer but I can say 110% I am VERY PLEASED with the ASUS F555L and the upgrades I performed."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "Review from a former computer store owner (10yrs) who has seen it all.\n\nFirst, I think this laptop is an incredible value and more than most folks will need. I upgraded RAM to 12GB and it is more than equipped to handle most modern operations other than high end gaming/graphics. I am pleased with this buy.\n\nHowever, there are some glaring shortcomings.\n\n1. The webcam is utterly horrendous. They might as well have left it off - I had a better webcam back in 1999. Fail.\n\n2. The hard drive (and battery!) is only accessed after removing keyboard/bezel - this allows for a thinner design but I am not pleased that I must void my warranty to upgrade to SSD. Not cool!\n\n3. The most annoying, absolutely unacceptable problem I encountered - after testing thoroughly with just RAM upgrade I was satisfied laptop was functional and successfully upgraded to SSD. To my horror, only after drive upgrade did I test headphone jack and discover it was not working! Fearing I had damaged the board (adjacent to HD) my experience nevertheless led me to an hour's experimentation with drivers (unpaid!) and to my relief the problem was solved:\n\n**If your headphone jack/speakers are not working - you must remove current Realtek Audio driver and roll back to the previous version on Asus's website!**\n\nSo overall I think this is some great hardware for your dollar, but it is absolutely unacceptable that the machine wouldn't be fully functional on arrival! Folks who don't know how to replace a driver might have to spend an extra $40 at their local computer shop to get this cleaned up..."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "In addition, to the typical email, browsing, and Office, I use my laptop for streaming HD videos, which I view via HDMI to my TV. After my 2009 17\" Macbook started failing, I thought I'd buy a new 13\" Macbook. Unfortunately, that model's max resolution is only 1440 x 900. So I searched for a low-cost Windows 10 laptop to tide me over until Apple upgrades their 13\".\n\nThe ASUS F555LA-AB31 fit the bill perfectly. It took a bit of tinkering with Windows 10 settings to get the graphics to my liking.\n\nFor those of you have a problem with how small the text is at maximum resolution:\nGo to \"Settings\"> \"System\"> \"Display\"> \"Advanced Display Settings\"> \"Advanced Sizing of Text and Other Items\". Then click \"set custom scaling level\". Then increase the percentage to 125% or 150% as you wish (It says \"not recommended\", but it's been fine for me). In this same Settings window, I also increased the font size of each of the options by 1 point. Now the text size is comfortable. Oh one last thing, I use Chrome as my browser and set the default zoom to 110%.\n\nLike other commenters, I found the trackpad to be a little squirrelly, and sometimes unresponsive. I first reinstalled the Asus trackpad driver, which solved the responsiveness problem. I still had problems with the scrolling gesture sometimes being interpreted as zooming. I used the Asus Smart Gesture app from Windows Control Panel and disabled the \"Zoom\" feature (which I use with touch screen devices, but don't need in a laptop). Now everything works great.\n\nSo, no it's not a Macbook, but for over $1000 less and a bit of time adjusting the settings, this laptop is amazing!"}

I even bought an additional 8 GB of RAM, making it a 12 GB system; but nevertheless, it continues processing slow with loading. In top of all of that, they sent me a wrong color.

If that was the case I'd be looking at much pricier models from ASUS that can tackle that task.\n\nI work for a Virtual company and decided not to be forever tied down to my office computer. Most of my work is done on a Mac but I can supervise, view, and even lightly edit pretty much everything I have needed to on this computer. Things like Skype, Evernote, Office365, Adobe CC (Just Acrobat, Photoshop, and InDesign installed on the laptop) all work without issues and let me do my daily work tasks.\n\nIt holds a good charge. If I want to spend the second half of my day in the backyard working, or the living room, it will hold charge for those 3-4 hours with no issues.\n\nThe one thing I have found slightly annoying is the keyboard design. I imagine if it ever needed replacing like my wife Toshiba laptop it will be a pain in the ass due to it's seamless design. As far as keying on it, no issues. I actually was very happy since it's just about identical to the Mac style keyboards I am used too.\n\n5/5 Stars. ASUS is a great brand that has kept their products at an affordable quality level for everyone from novices and light business users to the hardcore gamers. Props to them."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "I was looking for a good value in a standard laptop and have to say the F555LA fits perfectly. I paid less that three-hundred fifty dollars for the laptop, and then added about two hundred dollars of upgrades.\n\nThis laptop comes with Windows 10 Home, which runs excellently, and there was no junkware that instantly had be removed. As I wanted a dual boot Windows/Linux system, I shrank the preconfigured Windows disk partition and tried to install CentOS 7. Unfortunately, there did not seem to be any Linux device driver available for the Realtek Wifi card, which does work pretty well on Windows.\n\nA little research said I could get some upgrades, that were totally Linux compatible, although installation would be a bit painful. I ordered a 500 GB SSD (Samsung 850 EVO), 8 GB of RAM (Kingston KVR16LS11/8), and an Intel mini-PCIe Wifi card 7260. HMWG. There is a video on Youtube on how to open the laptop and replace the disk drive. The RAM is accessible from the outside through a little door on the bottom. The Wifi card is the hardest one. While its open for the disk driver upgrade, you need to take out the battery (4 screws), and the mainboard (dont forget the screw for the fan. You can leave the cable to the display connected and just flip up the mainboard enough to unscrewed one screw on the Wifi card, pop out the old one and pop in the new one. Ive never removed the mainboard on a laptop before, although am very experienced with hardware upgrades. Things are small and delicate, but all I needed was a small screwdriver and plastic pry tool to open the case, and replace the disk and wifi card. I guess this means serviceability is good, although I see a replacement mainboard costs way more than I paid for the whole computer new. Assuming a replacement battery part is available in a few years, this also proved to me that non-removable battery will not be a problem. Unlike on an Apple laptop, if my laptop dies, I could remove the disk drive and get at my data if needed, and the 8 GB SODIMM and WiFi card might also be reused someday. I also picked up a laptop disk to USB 3 adapter for a dozen bucks, so the original 500 GB spinning disk drive is now a disk for backups.\n\nThe new parts work perfectly. Windows 10 boots in under 10 seconds. Good job to Microsoft on making the Win 10 licensing easy, I just installed Win 10 onto the SSD from a DVD (this laptop still has a real DVD reader/writer) and it just figured out it was licensed for Window 10 Home, no key needed. Linux has in kernel tree drivers for the Intel Wifi card, and already had drivers for the Realtek gigabit Ethernet card also on the laptop. A note about the 8 GB ram, Asus says it only supports a 4 GB ram upgrade, which is true if you want to enable dual memory controller channels. There is 4 GB soldered on the main board, and adding a 8 GB SODIMM causes the memory controller to not configure in interleaved mode. Single memory controller mode (onboard 4 GB only or onboard + 8 GB SODIMM) gives about 12 GBytes/sec of memory bandwidth, and dual channel (if you used onboard + 4 GB SODIMM) should give about 24 GBytes/sec, although for most uses, there is not a lot of application performance difference. For many uses, 12 GBytes total ram will give way better overall performance than 8 GBytes, even if that 12 GBytes is slower. The new Intel Wifi card also works a bit better under Windows too, specifically MIracast screen sharing now works (it didn't with the Realtek Wifi). In Windows 10, I can say share my screen with my Roku 3 player, and it works well. Linux compatibility was the real reason for the Wifi upgrade, and since I was going through the pain of opening it up put in the SSD.\n\nAs others have said, the screen is not an IPS display, so its viewing angle is limited (very usable, but definitely not as nice as a MacBook Pro). There is also no keyboard backlight, so its pretty hard to type in a  dark room. I did plug the HDMI connection into my 4K TV and it worked perfectly (HDMI 1.4, 4K@30fps). It even worked to stream 4K video from youtube with cpu usage that must mean hardware accelerated playback. The processor is a Broadwell i3-5010U which cpu benchmark sits say is about 75% of the performance of the I5-4258U in my 13 MacBook Pro (late 2013). Considering my upgraded F555LA has twice the SSD storage, and 50% more ram, at about 35% of the price of the MacBook Pro, it seems like a good value. My laptop even came with TPM 2.0, even though the box said no TPM (although Windows 10 Home does not support disk encryption)\n\nIs this the best laptop, no, but for about five hundred fifty bucks, I got a very decent performing laptop with an ok 1080P screen, 500 GB SSD, 802.11AC Wifi compatible with Windows and Linux, a wired gigabit Ethernet port and DVD read/write drive. My only real question is why cant I buy a preconfigured system with all this + an IPS screen and backlit keyboard in the $600-$700 range. I have to believe the price I pay for a SSD in a retail store is a lot more than ASUS/Dell/HP/Lenovo can buy them for. If I could just buy it preconfigured, it would also not need warranty destroying upgrades.\n\nWithout any of these upgrades the ASUS F555LA is still just an incredible value at a third of kilobuck. This is not a lot more than a low end Chromebook. The only upgrade I really needed for Linux compatibility was the twenty five dollar WiFi card."}

Thank you very much.\nLaptop  two day ownership review:  Looks sleak, definitely not a cheap laptop from distance. Very fast ( could not tell that it was less than an i5), loud speakers ( but not quality), nice screen but found it too much for me as text was so small, cheap plastic (squeaking,  something felt like was moving around by the right hinge, CD/DVD player wasn't flush with the case, cheap looking plastic hinges.  Very hard to see keyboard  ( keyboard and touchpad good) in low light.  No light for caps or numeric  I decided not to replace it with same, but instead buy the Toshiba L55-C5272 ( currently for $349.99 Staples after $50 rebate and trading a very old laptop for $150, 2 3.0 USBs ,  USB charging even with laptop shut off,  1T HARD DRIVE , 8GB memory )  which has aluminum case, backlit keyboard, excellent case, definitely one of the best keyboards I have used.  And i5.\nBack to ASUS,  I really wanted to keep this laptop, I did like it,. noticed that BB  currently has it for same price but with bigger hard drive and memory but with the 720 screen which I find better than the 1080 for such a small size screen (when it comes to reading, facebook, etc - Yes, images were better with FULL HD).."}

Perfect for general use applications - internet, streaming media, productivity apps - but I haven't tested it for gaming and wouldn't imagine it would be much of a performer in that respect.\n\nBuild quality is fine, if mostly plastic, but the brushed aluminum keyboard face is really slick. I've had it running on the charger for entire work days and it never even gets warm. I've never heard so much as a whisper of fan noise, but again, I'm not putting it through any intensive paces.\n\nWindows 10 runs great on it. Never had any crashes or major hiccups. Boot up time is a little on the slow side, but nothing to write home about, and once it's up and running it never lags noticeably.\n\nThe only major flaw I've found in a month (and the reason I docked a star) is with the keyboard. It feels somewhat flimsy, with noticeable flex in the chassis when you type. And it has a really annoying habit of missing key strokes. Like, a lot. In the process of writing this review it has missed four key strokes. At first I thought it was just my fingers getting used to the keyboard but now I'm certain it's not.\n\nI still recommend this laptop for anyone on a budget. If the keyboard annoys you it's all too easy to plug in an external one."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "Excellent choice and amazing price.  If you research this brand, Asus, it has high accolades in consumer electronics and not an economy brand such as Acer.  The look and feel for an over 15\" screen laptop is not bulky or square.  Extremely attractive, hinge is not flimsy, the entire laptop has a great feel and quality to it. The audio is really outstanding, loud and clear, you can play Youtube music videos while on the table or counter top and hear the music very well across the room, something my more Dell cant do. Set up took just under 10 minutes. Friendly language rather than commands used to guide you through the process so makes the experience of a new laptop even more exciting and fun. This is my daughter's laptop and she uses for college work. She uploaded Microsoft Office Home & Student 2016 and works great. Has the CD DVD RW tray, along with 2 USB 2 and 1 USB 3 ports. HDMI ready as well. Wireless connection easy. Bluetooth capability. Keyboard is quiet and smooth, and responsive, not clicky.  Operates on Windows 10 with Microsoft Edge and you are going to want to change the settings Edge opens with or you'll be force fed news feeds every time you start the Edge browser.  Sometimes you need a break from the world.  Click three dots on top right (not the cog wheel) and go to settings and down to \"A specific page\" and change to Bing or another search engine you enjoy or a homepage.\nLaptop has pretty decent forward facing camera. This laptop is not a touchscreen, and pixel display is not as sharp or deep as say a Sony or Dell laptop, but the colors look true and pretty good for a laptop priced so affordably!  One more small thing, comes in an attractive, easy to wrap Asus box for gift giving."}

Wanted to swap out the factory installed Panasonic 9.5mm (model: UJ8HC ) with a Blu-Ray drive, but after an inquiry with ASUS technical support, the Technician at ASUS informed me that a supported Blu-ray drive had not been benched as of September 2015.  I am now very happy with this ASUS F555LA; the price point for this laptop does make it a no-brainer. I'd still like to swap out the DVD-RW drive, since the display is Full HD ( 1920-by-1080 ) resolution. The non-backlit keyboard is a minus as well as the sub- chiclet key's are not as responsive as I had on the Gateway M-6824.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "For this price I'm thinking it's the best value for the dollar in a budget laptop, because I haven't seen a screen this nice on a sub-400-dollar laptop before. You get a full size keyboard with 10-key pad (MacBook Pro doesn't even have that), it's super light weight yet includes a DVD burner. Someone else mentioned that the screen was NOT great and text was blurry, and that may be a defective unit unfortunately. The screen on mine was quite sharp (\"sharp\" is relative I realize... we have a 15\" MacBook Pro w/Retina in the house and no standard LCD can match THAT, but for a cheap LCD, the Asus' screen is quite impressive).\n\nThere are a few cons to a laptop at this price, main one being the keyboard really. Instead of a solid keyboard in a metal tray like with more expensive laptops, the cost saver here was a cheap keyboard built into the THIN top deck. You can definitely push down on the keyboard and have the whole thing sink in a little. Not a deal breaker at this price. But the other sort-of downer is the hard drive and the upgrade options. I set this up as our laptop for Rosetta Stone language learning and coming off an i7 desktop I don't want a sluggish unit. i3 processors are not too bad but they need help, mainly with an SSD as the hard drive. This laptop comes with the dreaded 5400rpm mechanical drive which is unacceptably slow in 2015. We didn't need a ton of drive space so I grabbed a Samsung 250GB SSD for 79 bucks on sale and installed it, and it truly sped up but THAT is the big downer... the installation. There isn't a hard drive slot (or door on the back) that you pop open to exchange the hard drive, the drive is inside the laptop and you have to pop the deck off the laptop, a clip at a time, basically disassembling it. I did find a YT vid where a guy walks through it, just search the model number. I work on PCs all the time so no biggie but it's a little involved. NONETHELESS, with the SSD this thing is a little speed demon now, not for gaming obviously, but for every day stuff it's QUITE relevant. Again, the screen is a surprise, really quite nice for this class laptop. Oh, it has 4GB ram soldered on the motherboard, and there is a VERY easy-to-access extra RAM slot on the back requiring only one screw, and I popped that off and put in another 4GB 1.35v stick I happened to have, so now this thing is running the i3 w/8GB ram on a Samsung 850 SSD (non-pro model) and it's pretty quick for what it is. The laptop is very inexpensive and the case is kinda cheap as expected, so don't drop this thing, but it's a good travel size laptop and with the SSD the battery is averaging 4-5 hours (with the brightness down a little). Not bad for most flights.\n\nOh, yeah, disclaimer: I'm not sure how Asus will feel about you popping the top deck off when it comes to honoring the warranty, so it probably voids the warranty. But the cruddy mechanical hard drive makes the laptop pretty much useless by 2015 standards, so I figured I might as well give an SSD a shot, and it worked very well. But my lawyer (if I really had one, lol) would make me say the following: THE AUTHOR OF THIS POST ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILTY IF ANY DAMAGE IS INCURRED FROM ANY OWNER-EXECUTED UPGRADE OR DISASSEMBLY. PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK AND RESPONSIBILITY. Ok, legal broohah over with!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "It's very hard not to like this laptop a great deal considering some of the features that it has and the (to me) astoundingly low price. Compared to a Chromebook, for example, you get a whole lot more computer for a modest jump in price (for the same screen size). The computer has a very solid and professional feel to me and I disagree with a few other reviews that say it has a cheaper feel--I don't find that to be true at all (and I own another ASUS, a K501LX 15.6 Inch, that originally retailed for around three times as much).\n\nPerhaps the most important thing for me in a laptop is that it has enough flexibility to integrate well with other toys--and this laptop has a lot of integration flexibility--more so than that K501LX, in fact). For one, it has three different USB ports (one of which I use almost 100% of the time for an Amazon Basics mouse--I am not a trackpad fan, particularly if I'm sitting at a table and have a good mouse surface) and it has HDMI. The HDMI port is an excellent addition because it enables me to plug the laptop into my Epson projector and give slide shows (I teach photography workshops) or even watch a movie--which I did first thing. It also has an SD slot, so you can download photos or sound files quickly.\n\nThe screen, important to me because I view a lot of photographs (both online galleries of other photographers and my own images) is actually quite good--a much better graphics quality that I was expecting to be honest. Yes, the screen has its limitations, no question, this is not a high-end screen. The screen has a slight warmish cast (you can correct that with a calibrator, I assume) and it has a matte surface, so it doesn't have that great snap that a high-end glossy screen has and it is certainly no match for my Apple retina display (nor should it be at this price). Yes, there is a drop-off if you turn the screen a bit, but I tend to sit right in front of the computer, lol, so it's never an issue.\n\nThe computer is surprisingly fast, but so far I'm using it mainly to surf and use built-in software features. It's *great* that it came preloaded with Windows 10, by the way. I've yet to install Office and that's got to happen soon so I can use Word (would be great if it shipped with Word, but that's asking a lot) but I don't think Word will run slowly. You can add one 8gig chip to bring it up to 12gigs total, which is probably a good idea if you are gaming. The very first thing I did with this computer was to watch a movie and again, if you were to compare it to a higher-end screen you'd see a difference, but otherwise it's very acceptable--your eyes do get used to whatever screen you're watching provided it's not totally inferior and this is far from that. The speakers are touted by ASUS as being great, but I'd rate them more as adequate and I ended up toying with a small blu tooth speaker (just to test the blu tooth range) and ended up listening to most of the film through that. But again, having blu tooth capability (and you can run a wireless printer, which is nice) is nice, too.\n\nThe laptop has a solid and substantial feel. The keyboard is actually comfortable, but it's not backlit so you'll need a light in dim situations. But I will say the wrist area is super comfortable and the whole keyboard has a nice feel to it.\n\nOverall, I really just wanted this laptop to keep in the den so that I can surf or do some research while I'm watching the tube, or watch a film sitting on the back porch, but I was surprised that it's a more substantial machine than that. I think this would make an excellent laptop for a high school student or anyone that didn't want to invest big bucks into a higher end computer. Based on price, I can't see an obvious reason to give this less than five stars, but of course that must take the affordable nature into consideration. But on the other hand, I can hook this computer up to my Epson projector (or my Vizio TV, for that matter) and my other ASUS lacks HDMI port, so this one actually wins that battle.\n\nHard to believe you can buy laptops today for this price--and just how light and nice this feels compared to laptops only a generation or two ago."}

As such it does not have any particular strong or weak points. The product finish is quite nice for the price point: the outside is a finely grooved hard plastic while the inside is a nicely patterned silver.\n\nThe screen is a typical low-end one with the limited viewing horizontal and vertical angles that come with it. A small saving grace is the full HD (1920x1080) resolution which makes for better image in HD movies. The screen is not particularly bright but it is acceptable. I like that there are keyboard shortcuts that not only allow you to turn brighten/dim the screen but you can also turn it off.\n\nThe keyboard to me (I know this is very subjective) has a weird layout especially for the control keys(arrows, PgUp/Down, Insert, Delete, etc). It made it quite difficult to type efficiently at first. The same keys also managed to confuse some of my programs to such a point that they were unusable. I have not had this happen before. I also wish that the keyboard was backlit to aid low light typing.\n\nBattery life is around 4 hours with light usage, more if you turn down screen brightness.\n\n Pros:\n - HD screen\n\n Cons:\n - finicky touch pad when it comes to tapping\n - no visual indicator for Caps/NumLock makes it difficult to tell if on/off"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "At this price point, this is a budget laptop but the quality and fit/finish makes it feel like a more expensive laptop. My Acer R14 (Core i7, 8GB DDR3, touch screen, 1TB 7.2k HD, etc...) doesn't feel quite as good as this Asus. The F555L has a nice textured metallic surface on the outside and on the keyboard panel. It is a very large laptop, with a 15.6 inch wide screen but the keyboard is a full sized chiclet keyboard complete with a number pad. However, it is a very lightweight laptop.\n\nIt comes with Windows 10, so an upgrade from 8.1 wouldn't be necessary. The specs aren't the best. Core i3, 4GB RAM (only a single slot that is upgradeable), and a 500GB HD. However, it comes with an optical drive where most laptops these days don't include one. The Realtek 802.11ac wifi doesn't impress me though. It somehow only connects at sub-100 Mbps speeds with my Google OnHub whereas the Intel 802.11ac card I installed in the Acer R14 connects at 500-700+ Mbps with the same router. After some investigating, I had to go into Device Manager -> Network Adapters -> and go into Realtek 8821AE advanced settings, change Wireless mode to 802.111/a/n/ac and enable multi-channel concurrent. Afterwards, my wifi connection speeds went to 802.11ac speeds instead of g/n single-band speeds.\n\nThe processor is the Core i3-5010U part of the Broadwell family, with a 15W thermal design power (TDP) rating, and 14nm process running at a max of 2.1 GHz. It comes with 3MB of L3 cache. The RAM is the interesting part and wasn't well advertised. It comes with 4GB of DDR3-1600 that is soldered to the motherboard. There is only 1 empty RAM slot, with a max RAM capacity of 12GB - meaning you can opt to put a max of 8GB of DDR3 into that slot. I had a few extra 4GB DDR3 sticks lying around and popped one in for a total of 8GB, which will be more than enough. The optical drive is a Matshita UJ8HC, nothing to write home about as it is a 8x DVD-R/RW. The graphics is onboard Intel HD5500 with the core running at 900 MHz with 1GB of RAM. As a comparison, my Acer R14 has a Broadwell Core i7 5500U (2.4 GHz) with 4MB L3 cache, 8GB of DDR3-1600 RAM, and the HD5500 running 1GHz core with 1GB of RAM. But the processor cooling fan runs a lot more frequently on the R14 than with the F555LA-AB31.\n\nReplacing the RAM requires removing a sticker covering a Phillips screw on the bottom panel. There's a small panel that has a ridge for prying, but be sure to remove the small black round sticker covering the Phillips screw first. Replacing the hard drive isn't as quick as the top bezel (the keyboard area) needs to be pried apart. I saw a few YouTube videos detailing this procedure.\n\nOverall: 5/5 stars, at this price point, you do get quite a bit for the money. It's not the fastest laptop, but at this price you can afford to upgrade the RAM and hard drive in the near future. I'd recommend at least 8GB of RAM (buy an extra 4GB DDR3 stick), and a 500GB-1TB solid state drive. The processor isn't top of the line but the Core i3's have impressed me with decent performance for anything other than gaming or processor intensive applications. The build quality is impressive as usual with Asus"}

It replaces a 3 year old Asus laptop that's similar but has an HD screen, not a full HD screen, and has a Core I5 instead of a Core I3.  Because of the weaker CPU I wasn't sure I'd like it but I've been saving for a while for a new laptop and suddenly I needed something right away and I decided I'd be better off getting this and holding on to the rest of my savings till the big holiday sales start and getting a better one then.  But this is so good I don't feel the need for that better one.\n\nThe screen is excellent.  It's not IPS but viewing angles are fine: better than my old one.  And being full HD makes a huge difference.  It is a bit slower doing some things but not enough to be a problem, and most of the time it seems a bit faster.  That's probably because of the newer model CPU.  It has fewer and less capable cores than my old one but since they're about 3 generations later the difference is minimized.\n\nThe keyboard layout is the same as my other one but the spacing of the keys is nicely improved.  It also has bluetooth, which my old one didn't, and that's very useful to me.  I no longer have to tie up a USB port for a mouse.  And the bluetooth is very solid.\n\nI had a bluetooth dongle in the USB port on my old one and I used a bluetooth speaker with it, which I do with this one as well.  The dongle I had was a fairly good one but this one produces much better sound out of the same speaker.  I'm not sure if that's because the bluetooth is better or because the sound circuitry is better,  I just know it sounds better.\n\nI'm extremely pleased with this thing and I recommend this to anyone who wants a really solid laptop and doesn't need a lot of horsepower.\n\nBarry"}

However, amazon fell a little short on their end..  Having been a amazon customer for several years, I was a bit astonished at the treatment I received.  This was my second choice, because, amazon increased the price of my original selection which was a touch screen, by $45 between the time of selection and less than a week later when going for purchase.  Having worked in the business world for most of my life, I find this particular business practice detestable.  other than settling for the lack of a touch screen though, I find the ASUS computer to be a very nice computer, especially for the price."}

There's good enough audio to go with the above average video, but you've got a shortage of RAM overall.\n\nHere's the bigger picture:\n\n1. Full keyboard, including number pad. That's good. On mine, the left side CTRL key sticks, but not too often. I haven't decided if the space bar issuesI'm having are my typing or the PC. I'll assume that's on me.\n\n2. Audio sounds good.\n\n3. Hard Drive is a touch on the small side at 500GB. I never thought I'd say that, but it is. By the time you install Windows10 and other programs, it'll run out quicker than you expect. And if you're not comfortable putting in a second one? That's problematic.\n\n4. 4GB of RAM isn't enough. I added 8GB and it now recognizes 12GB of RAM. That works better.\n\n5. SmartGestures/Trackpad: it's easy to use and easy to set to turn off automatically if you plug in an external mouse. I like that.\n\n6. Durability? Feels a bit fragile. May not be, but I'm not dropping it to find out.\n\n7. Battery life? Meh. Not a lot of oombh in the battery. Also, I don't like inaccessible batteries. Not in phones, not in laptops. Should be more accessible than it is.\n\n8. Included software? It's mostly auto-download links rather than full programs.\n\n9. Video quality is better than my old laptop. I can see my nosehairs in Youtube videos now. Whether or not that's good for the universe is another discussion.\n\n10. It's not a major workhorse, but it does the job solidly."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "An excellent cost conscious machine. This is an excellent machine with a few limitations for the cost.  For basic word processing and web access in Windows 10 the system with an i3 and 4 GB of Ram and 500 MB of disk space is more than adequate. For more advanced games such as Skyrim and the forthcoming Fallout 4 there are real limitations (Fallout 4 also requires a 3rd party graphics card unavailable for this form factor).\nI chose to install Ubuntu Linux which was both high performing (speedy) on this configuration and which integrated well with the hardware including shutdown and reboot from the operating system. In Linux this is certainly a powerful enough machine for serious software development (I am using it for machine learning experiments). Upsides to this laptop include a full-sized keyboard including number pad, and an easy to access compartment for replacing the LiPO battery. The only downside I've found so far is that there is not adequate clearance between the 2 USB 3.0 serial ports which make using 2 USB 3.0 devices with a plastic sheath like USB memory sticks impossible to insert.  An excellent system for the price."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "This is a nice entry level laptop that does have a 1920x1080 monitor which is pretty nice for a laptop in this price range.\n\nMy main issue with most PC brands is still true for this laptop is that I have to spend forever uninstalling all of the bloatware that comes on the PC.  After a while of uninstalling and waiting I got rid of all of the junk and started to install my software.\n\nThe keyboard has a good feel to it and feels solid, it also has a number pad which is nice.\n\nThe laptop in total feels solid and well made.  It has a slim profile but still has an optical drive, network port and the other expected ports (including USB 3.0).  I am glad to see a network port on a laptop, I find it annoying having to carry an adapter (like Thunderbolt to Ethernet).\n\nThe screen has a great resolution and looks good.  By default it has a zoomed in setting, which can be turned off, since I felt it took away the benefit of having a 1080 monitor and zooming in the content.  So I put zoom at 100% and now it looks great.\n\nThe i3 processor and 4GB of memory is fine for basic tasks (office and internet surfing).  I would not expect to play video games on this or do any serious development with emulators.  It does run Visual Studio with no problem and can compile without issue, but emulators lag (to be expected with 4GB of memory).  For a regular web and office user this should suffice just fine.\n\nWindows 10 is nice and I do like having the small start screen.  Cortona is a nice touch and is pretty useful.  Since the OS is not that important, I am not going to really talk about the OS, since if you don't like Windows 10 you can always switch to something else.\n\nThe camera is not good at all on this laptop, the camera is very low res and jumpy; so Skype calls are laggy and you are trailing with any movement.  If you want to do video calls or anything like that you should probably look for a different computer.\n\nMy main issue with this laptop is that they partition the disk into an OS partition and a Data partition.  I like just having one large partition with everything on it.  So I usually just go into disk management and delete the data and extend the os partition, but they put the recovery partition between the data and os partition, meaning that the Windows disk management tool cannot combine them.  All of the tools I have for partition management would not work on Win 8 and 10, so I just reformatted the data partition until I have time to research some tools and move the partitions around.  This is probably not a big deal to most, but I just don't like dealing with multiple partitions if not needed or used for the setup (for example my HTPC has a partition just for recordings so DVR content does not stop the OS; but other than that situation I don't see a point for dividing and most stuff will default to C: anyway...\n\nIn the end this is a nice laptop that is pretty good quality and offers decent specs for a regular office/web browsing user.  If you are this type of use you will not have an issue with this laptop and it should be a good balance of cost and usage.  The camera is useless in my opinion and the disk partition setup is annoying, but other than that it is a nice laptop."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "Works as I expected but it's a bit of an inconvenience that the battery and storage is not easily accessible. You will have to take the laptop in half to change/replace the battery or storage device. I had to do this to install a new SSD in place of the slow HDD. Overall the quality is good for the price and everything works as it should. The laptop is a lot lighter than it looks, weighing about 4.3lbs for a 15.6\" laptop isn't bad although it may feel like it's made from cheap and light plastic. I will be using this laptop permanently stationary so the weight isn't a big issue for me.\n\nTo open the laptop in half you will have to remove all the screws on the bottom of the laptop. There should be 11 total with three different sizes so remember which screw goes where. After the screws are out you need to push something flat around the laptop edge between the black and the silver part of the laptop. After you separate all around the laptop you can slowly lift up the silver portion enough to disconnect the two flex cables, allowing the whole silver portion to be completely removed. The rest should be easy from here. I downloaded Windows 10 from Microsoft and burned it into a DVD on my desktop computer. After the new SSD was installed simply put everything back together, turn on the computer, put the disk in, and follow the process to install Windows 10. After the installation is done it automatically activate Windows, no CD-Key or hassles required!  (May require an internet connection)"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "I'll put the bottom line at the top:  This is a very capable laptop with some great features, and it only costs $350.  OK, if you are a serious gamer, you will want something with a faster processor and faster video as well, but the I3 in this computer is really pretty fast.  Most people use their computer for email, Internet browsing, some word processing, doing their taxes, and maybe for their photos.  This will do a good job of all of that.  It has 4 gigs of RAM, and an open slot, so you can add more if you want.  It also has a full half terrabyte of hard drive space.  The screen is very high definition, and the keyboard is pretty easy to use.  Also, it doesn't get hot, and many other laptops get too hot for a lap.  All in all it has a nice set of features in an attractive five pound package, and a battery life of three or more hours, depending upon what you are doing.  For 90% of people this will do all they need.  Windows 10 is stable and familiar, and the screen is big enough."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "Excellent value at $350 especially with a full HD screen!  Intel i3 with 5th gen CPU has enough horsepower for most non-gaming needs.  4GB is also sufficient if not exactly spacious, but it's a lead pipe cinch to add another 4GB -- remove one screw and open the door on the back, takes one minute, literally.  Only real negative is the HDD, a 5400 RPM no less.  HDDs are slower than molasses in January so I'd strongly recommend yanking the HDD and installing an SSD.  You can get the Crucial BX100 250GB right here for $80.  250GB not enough?  The 500 GB is around $160.  Then delete McAfee (a massive pig) and other bloatware, and you'll have a laptop that boots up in mere seconds. Warning: Installing the SSD is substantially more complicated. If you aren't comfortable taking apart a laptop and tinkering with its parts, then get a friend to do it who is. The reward is worth it."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "As an entry-level laptop, this one is very good.  It has a nice screen, decent build quality, and is fast enough for every-day tasks.\n\nFor starters and clarification, I'm reviewing the Core i3 version that comes with Windows 10.  Additionally, it's somewhat confusing to figure out, but this laptop has 4GB RAM pre-installed, but still has a single accessible and open slot for more RAM.  The previous reviews I read were somewhat confusing as some said there's an open slot and others said the RAM is soldered in.  I think both are true, as the 4GB built in is not accessible via the small cover on the bottom of the laptop, but when you remove that cover, you find an empty slot.  The manual installed on the PC itself is more current than the one you find via the ASUS support pages.  Unfortunately it doesn't list the max RAM specs, although I've found info that says the max RAM is 12GB, which means you could install an additional 8GB in the empty slot.\n\nFor what it is, it's reasonably fast and Windows 10 works great on the limited CPU and memory.  The full-HD screen is a definite improvement over standard resolution screens, and it's nice to be able to see more of web pages and applications.  My son has a very similar laptop he got last year, which has the previous gen i3 processor, same amount of RAM and Windows 8.  They run similarly, but since his has a touchscreen, Windows 8 isn't all that bad on his.  I'd prefer this laptop with Windows 10, a higher resolution screen, and the newer generation processor.  My point in all this is that the price is in-line with what you get.\n\nAs for the build, you'll find this laptop is lighweight for its size, and the plastic shell will flex in the center of it whether you're simply typing, or picking it up.  The texture does a great job of resisting fingerprints and it's more subtle than I thought it would be.  I found that the keyboard misses keys more often than I'd like, particularly with using the spacebar with my right thumb.  I think part of that might be due to the flex of the shell.\n\nThe \"ice-cool\" feature works, although it's nothing that is groundbreaking.  I've had other laptops that don't heat up all that much, too.  Otherwise, it is quiet and keeps relatively cool when using.  The power cord brick is more like an iPad charger than a typical laptop charger, plus the cord is fairly short since it's only one piece.  It's nice for travelling, but short to route behind a desk or around obstacles like couches or chairs.\n\nWhile I wouldn't necessarily want to work on this laptop all day long, it's plenty good enough to use on the couch, for the kids' homework, and other simple tasks.  The price ($350 at time of writing) seems fairly well in-line with entry level laptops as well."}

But I can not imagine using this computer for any number of years, day in and day out, without some kind of status indicator for caps lock and num lock. There is nothing, not even feedback at the instant of toggle which could warn of an accidental toggle, a not uncommon occurrence.\n\nOtherwise, I would rate this maybe 3 stars.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "This is an entry level laptop.  The case itself looks good.  No gaps, and no excessive flexing evident.  The keyboard has a good feel.  No back light, however.  This computer does not run hot at all.  It remains very comfortable sitting on your lap with even extended periods of use.  The 500GB HD is fast enough.  It is not excessively noisy.  The screen is striking!  It is HD.  I have not seen this before at this price point.  Very nice touch.  The built in speakers produce decent sound.  Watching a movie on this machine is very enjoyable.\n\nThis machine has an i3 Intel processor.  Unless you are a serious gamer, this laptop should meet the needs of most users.  I do intend to add some RAM to mine (apparently the Kingston HyperX Impact Black 8GB 1600MHz DDR3L CL9 SODIMM 1.35V Laptop Memory (HX316LS9IB/8) is the unit needed), and I believe this inexpensive modification (<$42) will improve performance considerably.  All the software I installed (Office, PS6, Norton) runs fine.  PS6 takes longer to load and process images than on my older i7 Vaio, but remember, this is an i3 processor.  The battery seems to last around 3 hours.  I have not messed with all the power management options yet.  This may extend battery life.\n\nOverall, this is the nicest entry level laptop I have ever owned.  I stop by Best Buy once in a while and check out the latest computers.  There is nothing there near this price point that even approaches this laptop in overall value.  If you are not a serious gamer and do not work with large graphics files, this might just be the best solution for your new laptop requirement."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "This review is for the ASUS F555LA i3 with 4GB Ram and  500GB HD.\n\nAt the price point in the current market, this laptop is a good value for potential purchasers who are interested in utilization for activities such as email, office productivity applications, Skype video calls, surfing the internet, listening to music and less intensive video streaming like Netflix or Amazon Video. While the dual core i3 processors are quite proficient and video capability at 1920 x1080 screen resolution is featured, I don't believe anyone whose needs require support for upper tier functionality for video rendering, system intensive gaming or other CPU dominating applications would find the capabilities of this very affordable, competitively configured laptop.\n\nThe laptop has two USB 3.0 Ports (one designated for fast charging), an additional USB 2.0 port, 802.11ac wireless adapter, HDMI out port, VGA monitor port, DVD optical drive, Ethernet port, Buetooth, memory card reader, microphone and audio jacks and a VGA web cam and SonicMaster enhanced stereo speakers. The 500GB 5400rpm SATA HDD is adequate although obviously a disappointment for buyers who would prefer solid state drives.\n\nWith the Windows 10 Home edition operating system with Cortana assist and Microsoft Edge browser, 4GB memory is probably the minimum I would want to have available. As with any new OS, Windows 10 will take a bit of time to become comfortable with however the integration of the infuriating aspects of the tablet OS clone of  8.x seems tolerable. I haven't really spent enough time with Edge to comment and IE ( that I don't use) is also available as a pre-installed deliverable. Naturally, it is infested with bloatware like trial versions of MacAfee Security and Avast Secure Line although less encompassing than you may find with many other manufacturers.\n\nSome potential purchasers may be put off by its weight at about 5lbs but I don't find that heft to be out of line with a range of devices at similar or even appreciably higher costs. I like the aesthetics of the textured black composite cover as well as the textured gray interior bed, both of which will serve as a deterrent to smudges. It has to be mentioned there are some compromises some potential purchasers might find germane like the sponginess of the non-backlit chiclet style keyboard, especially in the area over the optical drive. As it turns out, there is a total absence of illumination as even the power, CAPS/NUM lock buttons and the optical drive lack any sort of illumination feature.  The keyboard is responsive but no one is ever going to mistake it for a mechanical.\n\n The touchpad is one piece, not overly sensitive (as compared say, with the Toshiba) and initially a little disconcerting with the audible click whenever depressed.  I wasn't enamored originally with the aspect of the non-removal battery or the difficulty of accessing the internal HD for possible replacement however I accept some compromises are required to provide the level of features available with this unit and still keep it at an attractive price. Then there are conveniences that are intriguing but I know I will never use personally like ASUS Smart gesture, where touchpad response can be configured to react in different manners based on the number of fingers applied to the touchpad or the availability of an app downloadable to a mobile device to allow the user to control the PC through Bluetooth.\n\nThis not a touch screen device and personally, I have little desire for one so thats not at all a factor for me.  However, once again with an eye towards acquisition costs, the existences of the full HD display with Intel HD graphics control at this price level is impressive, even if in actual use the distinctiveness of this 15.6 non IPS screen as compared to the 1366 x 768 display on my comparably sized much higher priced Toshiba L55 was not significant. In a simultaneous streaming comparison Netflix programming, the ASUS was just okay with a slight bit of delay which I attributed to the vast difference in processor capabilities but the on screen quality was in my opinion a toss-up.\n\n The ASUS may have had a slight bit of over-saturation, something correctable via software as I gain greater familiarity with it, but it was neither grainy nor lacking sharpness.  Im obsessive but I only did a this one then that one comparison rather than side by side of a retail DVD and I didn't notice any significant differences in the quality of display on either machine. However, Windows 10 DOES NOT include any DVD media playing program so you either need to get one from the app store or have another resource available to you.\n\nImpressions of audio efficiency will forever be diverse and I tend to fall on side of being underwhelmed. Such is the case here but once again I don't need a particularly big scorecard to note the number of times I have depended on the base PC for music playback. Unsurprisingly with a 2.0 stereo speaker set up the mid-ranges are decent but in the upper and lower ranges, theres much to be desired.\n\nSo, after evaluating the features available with this model unless there are specific needs that demand a more sophisticated setup, this ASUS model warrants genuine consideration."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "This Asus F555LA-AB31 is a very good budget / low-end laptop. With Windows 10 pre-installed, all you have to do when you first power it up is to go through a few setup screens (choosing the Express or the Customize Settings option [I chose the latter because the former uses default settings that have potential privacy impact that I'd like to retain control over]).  Even with choosing the Customize Settings scenario (which only involved specifying my preferred values for a dozen or so settings), I was done with the setup process in less than 30 minutes.\n\nThe laptop weighs about 5 pounds, is an inch thick, and has dimensions of 10 inches x 15 inches.  The exterior is mostly black-color plastic but the sleek finishing gives it an attractive brushed-metal look.\n\nThe CPU for this laptop uses Intel's fifth generation i3 dual core processor, which uses slightly less power than earlier generation processors.  The graphics card is the Intel HD 5500 which is better than the previous generation Intel HD 4400.\n\nThe laptop comes with 4GB of RAM, which is sufficient for non-demanding tasks, such as web browsing and surfing, emailing, watching DVDs, and reasonably-sized document writing and editing tasks (note, however, that this laptop does not come with Microsoft Office), and together with the Intel HD 5500-powered graphics capability, should be good enough for playing non-demanding PC games. You can add as much as 8GB of additional RAM to bring the total to a maximum of 12GB of RAM, however.\n\nFor file storage, the laptop uses a slowish 5400rpm 500GB hard drive, which comes already partitioned into a C: and a D: drive, which in the laptop that I received had capacities of 185 and 279 GB, respectively.\n\nYou can connect to the Internet using either a wired (Gigabit Ethernet LAN 10/100/1000) or wireless (WiFi 802.11ac which is faster than the 802.11n, but requires a 5GHz-band-capable access point) connection.\n\nThe laptop's 15.6 inch LCD display has no IPS (for wide-angled viewing) or touch support, but its matte finish and crispy 19201080-pixel Full HD resolution is better than what can usually be found (today) in similarly priced low-end laptops' displays. The audio is also very good, not tinny at all.\n\nOther notable features include a full-size but non-backlit keyboard with numeric pad, touchpad with integrated click buttons, a DVD reader writer drive, basic 0.3MP VGA video conferencing camera, two USB 3.0 and one USB 2.0 connector, both HDMI and VGA external display outputs, a combo microphone / headphones audio jack, multi-in-one-format media card reader, and Bluetooth 4.0\n\nThe battery life is about 4-5 hours, but your mileage may vary depending on the demandingness of the tasks being performed and other things such as the brightness level you're using for your display, etc.  In my testing involving almost continuous viewing of Amazon Prime videos in medium display brightness setting, I was able to get a little over 4 hours of usage before I needed to recharge the battery.  At the end of the 4-hour+ testing period, the fan had not been triggered and the palm-rest area was not even warm.\n\nThere is not much bloatware but it also doesn't come with even a media player for watching movie DVDs.  For this, I decided to download the no-cost VLC Media Player for Windows from the VideoLan website directly (you can download the app from the Windows Store also, but I opted not to do that).\n\nOverall, I think this Asus F555LA-AB31 offers very good value for the relatively low price."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "The HD 1080p and core i3 combined at this price is good. In fact, \"at this price\" factors into all the features. It is comfortable to use. The keyboard comes closer than most laptops I have used at feeling like a desktop keyboard. That's a plus for me. The numeric keypad works well. The big negative to the keyboard is that there are no indicator lights for the number lock or the caps lock. That is disappointing.\n\nThe picture is quite good and HD. The sound (without earphones) is surprisingly strong. With 4 GB and 500 GB, this is plenty sizable for most home and some business use. And, it comes with a R/W DVD. (I can't get it to open via the button and have to go to the File Explorer and do an \"eject\". That works fine.)\n\nWifi works well, Bluetooth does as well and it easily connected wirelessly to my HP printer. All of the setup went flawlessly. Windows 10, of course, is a matter of personal taste. I am getting used to it and miss Windows 7 less and less. A feature that ASUS advertises for this is the IceCool feature that keeps the palm rest area of the keyboard cool. I don't know that I ever noticed my hands getting hot on other laptops, but this one is certainly not warm to the touch at all. Perhaps that would be most noticeable by those who type all day.\n\nThis certainly seems to be worth the money and has features you would expect to pay more for. This would be well suited for students who are not power users and for normal home use. I am not a gamer, so I don't know how well it would work for that. Overall, I am pleased with how this works. Five stars for price/feature value, less some for the lack of keyboard indicator lights and optical drive opener problem. Really 4.5 stars, and I rounded up."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "My rating of 4 stars = I Like It is based on judging it for the uses it is intended to handle (see below) and I didn't give it 5 stars due to the screen being not the greatest. This is an affordable option for those whose needs match it's abilities.\n\nThe screen is decent when viewed from directly in front. If you move even three inches to either side the colors skew and it blackens. If it tips a half inch forward or back the view is not right. This is important to know if two people are trying to watch a streaming video on the laptop, for example, something some people do while traveling or when hooking the laptop to a home TV screen via HDMI cable is not possible.\n\nThe Intel Core i3 processor helps keep the price low but it limits your use of the laptop. This is not adequate for rendering photos such as digitally altering photos in Photoshop or if rendering video when editing video to create video shorts.\n\nThis laptop is best used by one person for basic web surfing, streaming video for one person to view, for checking email,and for using word processor or spreadsheet programs.\n\nIf you have a need for a faster processing speed or want a higher quality screen you will need to go with more expensive models."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "Typically, I have went overkill on PCs and Laptops.  This time I tried to better target my non-gaming usage.  You won't find another 1080P laptop in this price range and the i3 processor feels more than adequate.\n\nThe hard drive would be the weak link with the system.  I went ahead and ordered a new 250GB SSD from crucial (CT7756614) and followed the YouTube video for replacement. The trickiest part is popping the keyboard cover off without pulling the cables out.  Just be slow and patient and you shouldn't have an issue.\n\nAfter the hard drive is swapped simply insert a bootable Windows 10 disk or flash drive that you create from Microsoft (http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10ISO) and you are set. No Windows 10 key is needed nor is asked for (it is coded into the motherboard).\n\nThe memory upgrade is painless and you can add up to another 8GB.  The memory upgrade isn't as revolutionary as the SSD drive but I went ahead and did this because it was not cost prohibitive.\n\nThe end result is a 1080P laptop with a 250GB SSD and 12GB of memory in the $500 price range. Really tough to beat."}

I ran into a variety of issues with this laptop. For one, the display is grainy as hell - its absolute ass. Sorry, but when I view videos at 1080p and it looks like 360p at best (on a good day 720p), something is wrong. Next, on the outside, the laptop looks sturdy. However, when you open it, the laptop feels so cheap and a poor man's plastic. Very questionable. In addition to this, the keys sometimes don't work when you press them. You have to press down EXTRA HARD and its just too much of an inconvenience. To extend that, I have to talk about the battery charging (or the lack thereof). Constantly says \"Plugged in, but not charging\". I lose about 1% battery a day. And finally, sometimes the screen flickers and the colours change, looking very washed out, then quickly back to normal. Not sure if I got a lemon or not, but there are just too many issues with this laptop. WIth that said, I can NOT recommend this, or else I'd be fooling myself and others, which I can NOT afford to do."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "A pretty good product for the money.  I am a Software and Web Development student, and needed an affordable new laptop that could handle Microsoft Visual Studio and Netbeans, as well as Microsoft SQL Management Studio.  I also need to do basic word processing and use Google applications.  So far, this is working well enough, and while it does slow somewhat while multitasking, it gets by.\n\nI will probably upgrade the RAM at some point, as well as swap out the hard drive for an SSD, but out of the box, this laptop was able to handle everything I've thrown at it.  The i3 processor seems totally fine for most tasks.  Another bonus: I didn't seem to find too much bloatware installed on the computer, either.  Sure there was a lot of MS stuff, and the obligatory Candy Crush, but nothing else too intrusive.\n\nThe display is high resolution HD, but is somewhat limited in terms of viewing angles.  When you view the display straight on, however, it looks bright and sharp. Out of the box, text appears very small, since the resolution is so high.  I've been able to make some adjustments to increase readability, but it's still not great.  I am 30 years old and have pretty good vision, and I still have a hard time reading text within applications and web browsers.\n\nAs for build quality -- you get what you pay for. The chassis is cheap and plasticy, with no metal features, but it is acceptable.  The keyboard is pleasant to type on, but does make a cheap, loud, plastic clacking noise.  The keyboard does also flex as you type, but it doesn't bother me.  The keyboard was a major factor for me since I do so much typing as a developer, and this keyboard met all my needs.\n\nThe speakers are acceptable, too, though sound a bit muffled and tinny at times.  They're also pretty loud.  Battery life is average.  And the \"Ice Cool\" palm rest is just marketing gimmick -- I didn't notice any difference with any laptop I've used previously.\n\nOverall, the laptop works very well for what I've needed.  It looks sharp and is fast enough for most common tasks.  If you need decent machine to do routine tasks, this one offers a good value for the money."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "I have been using this laptop for a few weeks now.  I have to say it is a screaming deal for $349 (what I paid for it).  1080p display, plus a real Core i3, for $349?  Find another 15.6\" laptop in this price range with a Core i3 and a 1080p display, I can't find one.\n\nThe hard drive is slow, and is the single biggest annoyance.  It also is NOT designed to be customer replaced.  It can be, but you have to open up the whole computer including removing the keyboard to do it.  It is not for the novice, but following YouTube videos I was able to get it done.  Boots up from cold in just seconds, very lightweight, fast, and runs all Windows 10 software nicely (Office 2013, Acrobat, Quickbooks, etc).\n\nNote: This is NOT a gaming machine, I've tried a few games and they really don't perform.  Oh sure, it'll play basic web browser games, it'll play some of the Windows App Store games, but don't plan on playing Battlefield or Call of Duty on this, the GPU can't cut it.\n\nBut for $349 for a basic Windows 10 machine, well worth the purchase price.\n\nNote: while the HDD is hard to replace with a SSD, the RAM is easy, it can take a 8GB DDR3 SODIMM stick in the bottom for a total max of 12GB of RAM."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "Initial impression is that this laptop is a lot more plastic-y than I would've imagined.  I had recommended this laptop to a friend because the price and the fact that it is the most reasonably priced 1080p laptop.  The next available 1080p laptop is somewhere in the $600~700 range and he was in no position to purchase that one.\n\nYour results may vary but initially the trackpad had an issue where the left click clipping the bottom left corner because the clicking surface was misaligned.  Tracing the bottom left outline of the trackpad help correct this issue.  It is on the cheaper side so I cant expect the same level of quality control some of the higher priced asus laptops would have.\n\nI am somewhat complaining about the plastic construction but you get what you pay for.  The real meat of this laptop is the technology housed in that plastic.  It doesnt have the best viewing angles but I am quite pleased with the 1080p screen and I hope this trend will carry over into all modern laptops.  The i3 feels snappy and 4gb of RAM is enough for the average user/consumer.\n\nMy only real complain is that this laptop was not made with serviceability in mind.  Installing additional RAM is easy enough once you get past the plastic security piece over the RAM cover.  The task of installing an SSD or SSHD is not for the faint of heart because some disassembly is required.  I would knock 1 star off typically but after disassembling with the intent of installing an SSD, the internal hardware layout does make sense.\n\nCriticism aside, for the price this is a pretty nifty little laptop.  With a solid state it will fly and the user experience is great.  I would hope for a similar spec'd/design laptop but made of aluminum for $100~200 more but you definitely get value > 350 with this laptop.\n\nVideo disassembly to install SSD/SSHD\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1tupHjUKSg"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "One month use. For the price you really can't go wrong. A 1080p screen (by the way it has poor viewing angles), full size chiclet keyboard with a numeric keypad, mediocre build quality, and an above average processing power. Now my typical usage is surf the internet, watch videos, listen to music (the speakers are kind of bad), work on documents, and check email. Now what I do on this laptop may vary from person to person, but I believe it's comparable to the majority of average laptop users.\n\nSo the Pros: a large 15.6 screen that is an ok 1080p resolution (now for those who are having issues with the clarity with the screen, just downscale to 100% and you'll be ok). The colors on this screen is a bit warm and washed out, but what can you expect from this price point. Apparently this screen is not listed as a TN panel, but the horrible viewing angles would otherwise suggest that it is a TN panel. However the screen is really not that bad far and from the worst. It is a crisp/clear screen and easy on the eyes when reading. Also the brightness is fairly good and it helps that it is a matte display. Now on the specs. The core I3 on this laptop runs really well for what I use it for. I rarely see the system heat up or slow down when I'm using it. The ram is ok for me, I barely use over 3 gigabit. Also the boot up time is surprisingly quick for a system using a HDD.\n\nNow for the Cons: The battery life is kind of short. I get anywhere from 3 to 4 hours of battery life. This may not be a con for other users, but I am a student and for me this is not an all day battery life. The DVD drive worries me. It is really flimsy and I'm afraid it might break off. The build quality is all plastic and again in this price range I can't expect much. The top lid does in fact collect smudges and fingerprint. The speakers are bottom facing and sound really bad. On high volume the sound does distort a bit and the worst part is it does not get loud at all. The speaker drivers on this laptops are really weak and bad, so invest on some really good headphones or external speakers if you want to enjoy movies or music.\n\nClosing statement, for the price and for my usage this laptop is a really good fit. You get a really good screen, also really good processing power, and with an ok battery life. I really like this laptop a lot and coming from my old laptop I consider this Laptop an upgrade."}

While I waited for the order to be filled, I went to local stores to compare sub $500 laptops.  I think that the build quality is comparable to others in its class. My take: Screen -  bright with good colors and text, at the 1920 x1080 resolution everything is very sharp; Sound quality - very good set at 50% volume;  Keyboard  nice soft touch feel, easy to read letters; Touch Pad  works well but the R/L click is a bit loud; DVD player  works well; USB 3.0 ports   backup to a portable 3.0 drive is fast;  HDD  comes pre-partitioned with D:Data for backups etc.; Battery  I get about 4+ hours per charge; Esthetics  I like the overall look with the faux aluminium, but style taste is always an individual thing. The 5th Gen i3, Intel HD5500 video,  Full HD Screen, 802.11ac wireless and Win10 factory installed, are all positives.\n\nWindows 10 has worked well for me and hasn't been difficult to learn to use. It loads to the desktop in about 20 seconds and shuts down fast. Because of the high resolution screen, Win10 was factory set to 125%, which for many people with good eyes, would be adaquate. I prefer to use 150% and also adjust the font size  larger than default.  The screen appears to be a TN type which is more sensitive to viewing angle. However, once I set the screen at the correct angle, I don't find it to be a problem. If you want a wide viewing angle, buy a higher priced laptop with an IPS screen.\n\nAfter reading some of the negative reviews, I have to say that I feel fortunate that my unit didn't experience any of the problems that some other people have had. Overall, I'm happy with my purchase.\n\nI would have rated this 5 stars if the battery charge would last about 6 hours."}

On mine it was bowing away from the screen even.\n\nOne of the reasons why I purchased this unit was for the HD display.  Well the colors looked washed out, and text was blurry; Not my idea of HD\n\nJust to make sure I wasn't seeing things, I connected it to a mid grade ASUS external monitor, and compared side by side.  Yup, my external ASUS 3 year old monitor looked just fine, and my new laptop looked like a CRT with a dying picture tube.  Not sure if I got a bad one, or this is just a sucky cheap laptop.  Either way, I returned it and got a different brand.  If have better luck with that one, I will review it on Amazon.\n\nP.S. Normally I am a fan of ASUS products, as I have several.  Just don't think I am going to get another laptop from them..."}

I know the keyboard foil being bubbly and crinkled is purely cosmetic, but to me it indicates a cheaply made product. I'm sending it back and paying more than $350 for a computer.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "I spent about 20+ hours researching laptops because it is so difficult to find the best one at the best price. This is a good basic laptop for somebody who needs it for using Microsoft Office, Netflix, skype streaming and internet browsing. This laptop will do all of those seemingly easily. Do not buy it expecting it to do video rendering and 3d rendering, but the new I3 processor will handle basic stuff easily. For the price, it is great.\n\nPros:\n-The new 5th gen I3 processor is the latest technology which is nice.\n-Laptop is quiet, not really any fan noise.\n-Disk drive is nice to have.\n-Lots of USB ports (two 3.0's).\n-Price is excellent.\n-Full Keyboard.\n-The original 4GB of ram can be expanded easily (To I think 8 or 12 GB).\n-Looks nice.\n-Good battery ( Watched 2-3 episodes of netflix at full brightness and was only down to 78% ).\n-1 year free Acer accident warranty is AWESOME.\n\nCons:\n-I was a little disappointed in the screen, one big reason we bought it was that it was a real 1080p screen, however the screen did not seem to be any better than my 720p Acer Laptop. Also colors are not very vivid (But hey its less than $400!)\n-Screen at full brightness is not particularly bright.\n-Only 4 GB ram and 500 GB hard drive, but can be expanded.\n-Materials seem a bit cheap, it is definitely not premium feeling.\n-Was slower than I expected, but it is only a dual core I3. Still i expected the newest technology to be faster.\n-No touchscreen option.\n-Not lit keys.\n\nOverall, this is the best budget laptop for the price in my opinion. It got good reviews, I am happy overall. The I3 version doesn't have the absolute best specs or material, but it will do the basic things you need reliably. Will probably upgrade in the future, but for the daily school use and projects, it works great!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "Pro-\n*You cannot find a 1080p Full HD laptop for this price.  This is why I bought it and this is why it makes it worth every penny.\n*Good processor speed for the price.\n*Easily upgradable RAM\n*The laptop body looks good, has a good feel, and an overall quality look to it.\n\nCons-\n*If you are looking to replace the Hard Drive with a Solid State Drive its more difficult then most laptops, but not impossible.\n*The DVD tray gets stuck and is more flimsy then most other laptops.\n*As always, seems to be the trend with new laptops, it comes with to much bloatware.  Bloatware/unnecessary programs running that are unneeded at take up to much resources.  McAfee being the worst out if the bunch.\n\nSummary-\nIf you are looking for the cheapest 1080p Full HD laptop this is the best option. In my opinion 1920*1080 resolution is soooooooo much better then the traditional 1366*768 resolution you find in this price range.\n\nWith a 15.6 inch screen, this laptop is 141.21 pixels per inch.  Most laptops at this price point and the same screen size are only 100.45 pixel per inch. That means there is a 33% higher pixel density!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "I was really pleased to get a new, inexpensive laptop that fit my needs.  I really wanted a 1080p screen and a number pad on the keyboard and I got what I wanted.  Easily added 8GB of memory to this for a few bucks and using it as a family mobile workstation.\n\nPros:\n-1080p screen at this price point is unheard of!\n-Windows 10 out of the box.  No fiddling with 8.1 + upgrade to 10.\n-Love the number pad on the keyboard.\n-Very inexpensive\n-Easy to upgrade memory to something more respectable.\n-Stays super cool to the touch, even when playing games!\n\nCons:\n-The screen is not the most beautiful, but that was expected.  There is some slight light leakage, and viewing the screen from an angle reduces the picture noticeably.  Color looks a tad washed out.  Works fine for homework, office work, and internet browsing.  Maybe not so great for watching videos.\n-2 cell non-user serviceable battery means even though this is a low power device, run-time is still not very high (3 hours of light-medium use)\n-Not a fan of the 1 piece touchpad, but it's usable.  Maybe a tad oversensitive.\n-Lack of documentation from manufacturer is annoying.  It's like this model doesn't exist.  Box comes with zero product documentation.  There might be some on the laptop itself, but I didn't see it right away.\n-not a touch screen.  I knew this and I had no need for a touch screen, but this might be a deal breaker for some.\n-RJ-45 Network Jack utilizes some kind of collapse-able clip.  I'm concerned that this will get broken off at some point and make connecting to a physical network impossible with a USB network adapter.  Luckily this will be using WiFi almost 100% of the time.\n\nOverall, I felt like this was a steal.  I have been looking for months for a laptop with some of these features and was never able to get anywhere near this set of features or this price point.  So happy I'm seriously considering buying another for this family of 6!"}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "First off, full disclosure, I'm not at all tech savvy & if I make any mistakes, please let me know.\n\n  We've been looking for a starter laptop for our daughter while she was on summer break. I've been researching both windows & Chromebook platforms for features, value, & dependability. I shopped around some brick/mortar stores & found that for our sub $400 budget, the Chromebooks blew the windows laptops away as far as hardware, speed, & value. I was ready to buy the Acer15 Chromebook w/ the 1080p screen till I saw this Asus for pre-order for only $70 more at $349.99, today it's listed at $419. I was excited to see that it met all of my criteria for a windows laptop including a decent processor, 15.6\" 1080 screen, latest windows 10, it even had a 10 key which you cannot find in Chromebooks. A few things I was not thrilled about the laptop were that it had an HDD vs an SSD, I know it's to cut cost & bump up the specs, but I've much rather have the smaller/faster memory of the SSD. The other thing I wasn't looking forward to was the DVD drive since most of our media consumption now consist of online services, & I knew that by adding this, it was adding to the weight. Now armed w/ all that I need, I was willing to wait & got on the pre-order list.\n  I received the laptop about a week/week & half later, I was excited to take it home & test it out. Right out of the box, I was impressed by the looks of this product, it was a good color scheme(black & silver), it was thinner than I've expected, & it wasn't as heavy as I thought it would be. I turned on the laptop & as expected it wasn't blazing fast to boot due to the absence of SSD, but it wasn't horribly slow. I take out as much of the bloatware that I could find including the antivirus that was pre-loaded. Windows 10 is a very good looking OS, I have it on my desktop & I've been digging it. The first issue I ran into w/ the hardware is the screen was not up to par with what I was expecting. The viewing angles are poor at best, you really have to be looking straight at it to get the best view. That didn't deter me, I knew what it wasn't going to stellar considering the price point. I start surfing the web, & I must admit, it was on the slow side. I was right next to my router w/ full signal & pages took longer than expected to load. I tested the same pages on my nexus tablet to make sure it wasn't my connection & the tablet loaded the pages at least 2x as fast. I was getting worried at this point but I proceed w/ the test. The touch pad has smart gestures which allows you to scroll, zoom, & swipe. I found that while scrolling & zooming in web pages, there was a lot of lag w/ the process no matter what web page I was in. Also, the touchpad had a louder click when pressed than I would have liked. So after a somewhat disappointing experience w/ this laptop, I turn it off hoping to test it more the next day.\n  When I turn it on the following day, it was taking a long time to boot, I thought maybe it was installing updates so I leave it alone for 20 mins. I come back, it's still booting, then I see that it said something along the lines of diagnosing computer, still thinking it was normal, I leave it for another 10 mins. I come back & it's in a blue screen that said it was in \"automatic repair\" & it gave me the option to restart to see if that would solve the issue, it didn't. It restarted & the same loop happened, first it was diagnosing the computer, then it goes into automatic repair mode. I look up several forums to see if this is a known issue & it was. The majority of the people that ran into this exact issue had to wipe their computer, re-install windows(which this laptop did not come w/ a disk), & had to lose all their data stored in their computer. For me this was the last straw w/ this laptop, I was impressed w/ the hardware but not enough to risk having this issue for the life of the laptop, luckily we had nothing stored in there other than a few apps.\n  I'm now in the process of returning this w/ a replacement laptop that Amazon sent me & I'll be buying a Chromebook, specifically the Acer 15.6. I had a hands on w/ this laptop at Best Buy & it's lightning fast when loading web pages vs the Windows laptop. The screen & viewing angles were also leaps & bounds ahead of the Asus laptop. They might not have as many apps or features as a Windows laptop, but this is for a 12 year old girl, she'll mainly use this to research homework on the web & watch videos. The only disappointment she has is the Chromebook won't be able to run Minecraft for now.\n\nPros-\nDecent hardware\nLight weight\nScreen size\n\nCons-\nOS crashed\nSlow boot time\nStruggles w/ loading basic web pages\nPrograms took longer that expected to open\nA laggy touchpad, that's a little to loud for my taste when you click it\nScreen, although full HD, has horrible viewing angles\nLack of SSD\nDVD drive(for us this is a con)"}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B011KFQASE", "review": "I didn't expect much from this laptop. My parents bought it for me when I left for college. It looked okay after checking out the hardware specifications so I didn't complain. It worked great for a while, and could handle any everyday tasks I'd throw at it. I will say that its performance is worse than the specifications would lead me to believe. The battery life wasn't great, but could last me for a day until I got back from class. The display is okay, it isn't crystal clear and has a plastic cover, but it runs in 1920*1080 so it still looks good. I loved that it could have a plethora of tabs open and still run smoothly most of the time. I usually have at least 7 tabs open for doing homework and coding. Pretty much everything else about it was average. I will note that if the battery got low, it would immediately be worthless and would lag and buffer to no end, but it wasn't a huge problem because I was normally close to an outlet.\n\nI was hugely disappointed when it died after only a year and a half. It would be okay if it was a minor malfunction. I build my own computers, am studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, and am normally the person everyone turns to when they have a hardware or software issue. I put it down one night and tried to log on the next morning, but ran into trouble. I could see the lights come on but the screen was completely dead and I have no access to important features like the boot menu, recovery, or safe mode. Whether it's a hardware or software issue, I have no choice but to open the laptop and connect it to my desktop or test the circuitry on the display and hard drive, which is extremely annoying on a laptop.\n\nOverall, I think this laptop is way overpriced and only average. I could build a high power gaming rig for less than this. If yours lasts as long as mine did then it's a huge waste of money. I expected more from Asus, so I'd recommend spending your money on something else."}
