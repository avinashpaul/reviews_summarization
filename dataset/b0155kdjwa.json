For me i charge it with my Pro.\nIt is sold separately . I wish it came with the Pro as its really a wonder. You can use it in any sketch able app.\n\nAccording to me the iPad Pro should have something  built in  to attach the pen with it so that you don't have to look for the pencil when needed.\n\nMultitasking :\nIf you are a person who want to check mail as well as watch your favorite video then iPad Pro is best for you. As iOS 9 provides multitasking to all new iPad models but i think it comes out best with iPad Pro. in my iPad 4 i was missing this multitasking feature.\n\nA9X Processor has made the Pro fast and power efficient also.\n\nWatching movie and playing games is now a pleasure only because of iPad Pro.\n\n*******************************************************************************************\nApple iPad pro The new magical innovation in apple family. Get ready to catch this wonder of 12.9 inches in your hand .. not in your palm as its quite big. The iPad pro is available in 3 colors space grey, silver and gold. I chose gold over those 3. but keep in mind you have only 3 colors to chose in iPad pro whereas in apples Iphone 6S plus I got many options. I was just eagerly waiting to meet and grab this new magic of 2015 by apple. I am really happy to have this one now.\nPreviously I owned iPad 4 and now I have iPad Pro. My little one loves to watch her Peppa Pig fun in iPad 4 and now she is watching it in iPad Pro. It's better to say she is more delighted and happier than us to get the iPad Pro as she can watch her Peppa Pig in a big vibrant screen.\nwhat I loved most of this new magical iPad pro are :\n1) After seeing the size I thought it won't be that convenient but once i picked it up it felt like a feather. Even with the bigger screen i can move around with it without paining my hands.\n\n2) Camera resolution is much better now with 8 Mp on back and 1.2 mp on front. I liked the front one because its perfect for selfies and skype calls.\nFor video it captures 1080 p video with back camera and 720p with the front. It sound good.\n\n3) Quad speakers are really good.\n\n4) the usb cable is longer than I thought.\n\n5) smart connection pin is there for using accessories like keyboard which was not there before.\n\n6) Split screen apps, multitasking goes best with quad speakers. I can check my mail at the same time while my little one is watching her favorite cartoons.\n\n7) Believe me it's super fast.\n\n8) The stylus is a nice one to practice your drawing skill.\n\nThe couple of things i don't like about it are :\n\n1) After using my iphone 6S plus it feels like I am going backwards because there is no 3D touch, no live photos.\n\n2) The stylus and keyboard are sold separately so your budget will go up to get this magic Pro in a whole form.\n\n3) It's cheaper in best buy."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0155KDJWA", "review": "Let me say this right up front; I've enjoyed Apple iPads since they were introduced. However, I also use Android tablets, and have enjoyed those equally, including the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1, several Sonys, many iterations of the Nexus line, and my phone of choice is a Galaxy Note 4. So yes, I am a fan of Apple, but I'm equally a fan of Android. I don't see either platform as being better, just different.\n\nWith that being said, I will say that the iPad Pro is a beautiful, amazing piece of tech. It's HUGE (basically the size of two iPad Air 2s side by side.), but that screen is gorgeous to see. But what ultimately tipped me over to buying one is the speakers and the Pencil stylus. I'd love to give this a 5, but there are definitely a couple of factors that keep me from doing so. The first is the cost. This thing is EXPENSIVE enough to give you justifiable pause. You could buy yourself a nice powerful gaming laptop, like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/CUK-MSI-GE62-Apache-15-6-Inch-Gaming-Laptop-Intel-Core-i7-5700HQ-Processor-1TB-7200rpm-HDD-NVIDIA-GTX-960M-12GB-RAM-Windows-10-Operating-System/dp/B00YFE546W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">CUK MSI GE62 Apache 15.6-Inch Gaming Laptop (Intel Core i7-5700HQ Processor, 1TB 7200rpm HDD , NVIDIA GTX 960M, 12GB RAM, Windows 10 Operating System)</a>&nbsp;for the same, if not lower, price. In other words, I don't know if most people could justify the cost. But if you can, it has a great deal to offer in the way of power and true tablet capabilities that definitely set the iPad Pro apart, but you'll have to plunk down another $100 for the Pencil stylus to fully unlock those capabilities. It's undoubtedly the best digitizer for everything from note taking to masterpiece artwork, and I can easily see the potential for growth far beyond into just about every type of app, even games. It's literally like writing or drawing on a piece of paper. Apple may be late, but when they execute, they make it as close to perfect as possible.\n\nAnd the sound is far above and beyond that of ANY tablet, and even most notebooks, including most gaming machines. While the truly deep bass is lacking, the overall experience still has plenty of punch from lows to highs, and rewatching movies or playing videos or music gives you a rich soundscape that let's you hear things you didn't even know were there, from subtle instrument whispers to the slightest of reverb, and it makes the experience far more enjoyable because of it. And amazingly, dialogue stays true and evident even when accompanied by the loudest of effects. I'm not sure how Apple pulled it off, but I'm extremely glad they did. I've been waiting a long time for any tablet to have this level of sonic ability.  It sounds so good that it makes all the Dolby (or other) enhancements sound like a gimmick. Playing games, especially ones you've played before, brings immersiveness to a whole new level. You really have to experience it to believe it.\n\nWhile the screen is crisp and rich with color, I do see one other factor that leads me to hold back that last star, and that factor is screen brightness. Even at full brightness, it's not nearly as bright as other iPads, and I suspect that Apple HAD to do this in order to maximize battery life while keeping down the weight and thickness. I'm not saying that it's bad by any means, it's just not what you expect from an iPad. At least, that's been my experience.\n\nBut as a whole, I think this beast of a tablet offers the best iPad experience so far, whether for casual use or the most demanding tasks. Multitasking is not only possible, but actually worth it because of the A9X processor and ample screen real estate.  The bottom line is this: if you don't want to get one of these, then don't go look at one. You've been warned.\n\nPROS:\nSilky smooth performance, even when multitasking.\nRich sound that's truly exceptional, and not just OK.\nThe most natural, responsive digitizer capabilities, ever.\nHUGE, crisp screen.\n\nCONS:\nScreen brightness not nearly as good as other iPads.\nPencil stylus not included.\nEXPENSIVE, EXPENSIVE, EXPENSIVE."}

Needless to say, the iPad Pro blows it out of the water. It doesn't heat up at all, it's VERY energy-efficient, and it's so responsive that drawing feels truly natural. Digital illustration now feels like fun instead of a chore. If you're an artist and serious about digital illustration, I can't recommend it enough."}

Until today!\n Discovered this morning the entire screen had bowed outward, pushing the case wide at top and bottom. I can see into the insides from the top and from the bottom.\n It was not dropped, I used in on my bed day and night, nothing happened to it have have caused the screen to bulge out. I can squeeze it closed for a second or two, but it doesnt stay closed, the bulge or bowed out part is firm.\n Its still working, just have no way to know how long, and I have a huge amt of storage on it, don't even know how to save or transfer. I have my old small iPad, its still working, altho very slow to download. I have noticed the Pro slowing down, just thought it must be my internet connection.\n I have no idea what to do now, its out of warranty and no insurance on it. Can anyone advise me on this, has it happened to anyone else? Thank you."}

I purchased this iPad in October 2017 as a Christmas present for my wife, which is my second iPad.  After I purchased it, I placed it in my bedroom closet until it was time to place presents under our Christmas tree. My wife activated the device on Christmas Eve, and six months later, it stopped taking a charge. We took it to the Apple Store, which is an 80 miles round trip from our house.  The Apple Technicians told us it would cost $599.00 to fix the charging port because this repair is not covered under the Apple one year Warranty. After leaving the Apple Store, I called Apple Customer Service (it was a waste of time!), and talked to Chris, Apple Service Representative. Chris asked us to send him pictures of the iPad so that the iPad could be evaluated, which we did. The photos clearly shows that there is no damage to the outside of the device, but one of the bars inside the charging port is missing, because of this defect, the device will not take a charge.  My advice to anyone considering purchasing this iPad is Buyer Beware!!! Apple DID NOT stand behind this product. J.C. McCormick U.S. Army Retired"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0155KDJWA", "review": "When my Air2 died I immediately came here to purchase a 12.9 gold 256GB WiFi iPad Pro. I also wanted to be certain I got the 2nd generation version.  At the time Amazon did not have what I needed.  For two weeks I logged in hoping to find it, but ended up having I to get it from Apple. To say the least, I was surprised and disappointed.  Now to the important stuff.\n\nThe iPad Pro with its 12.9 screen is amazing. True, it is noticeably heavier than its smaller screened versions, but I find that unimportant compared to that huge gorgeous display and everything it can do.  Images are vibrant and crisp. With high speed WiFi even Vudus HDX movies have yet to buffer. Videos saved on the iPad Pro play flawlessly. The speakers are the best I have heard in a device of this type. Turn up the base and the iPad Pro will vibrate in your hands. Voices are clear and easily to understand. Music sounds like real music on the iPad Pro and not the muffled out of tune sound you get from many devices. A very major improvement there over the other tablets Ive had in the past.  Its processing power not only makes it lightening fast, but takes multitasking to a whole new level. I have found some web sites actually ID it as a MAC computer.  With iOS 11 and a good app from the Apple Store, you can download and install your expensive desktop fonts onto the Pro as unsigned fonts which will then be listed as system fonts. Two of the best apps that allow you to do this also have a version that will allow you to install Windows platform fonts onto your iPad Pro.  Not all apps will be able to use them, some (MS Word) can use some of them, but Pages has yet to balk at any of the fonts I installed. Even with huge, complex fonts like Crown Jewels, Pages used these without any trouble. You do need to check that your license for your fonts allows you to download them to the iPad Pro.\n\nOkay, so you are going to spend the big bucks to get the 12.9 iPad Pro, you should go an additional hundred for the Apple Pencil. The Pencil greatly enhances everything you do on the Pro and makes it easier too. Plugging it into your iPad Pro via the lightening port is the fastest way to charge it.  It will fully charge from 5% to 100% in about 25 to 30 minutes.  Once fully charged the Pencil can go 13 hours or more before needing to be recharged.  I always have my iPad at 100% charge when I plug in the Pencil and even after 30 minutes my iPad still shows a 100% charge.\n\nTo keep your iPad Pros screen clean, as well as your pencils tip, I advise getting a ClubGlove golf towel (sold here on Amazon).  I use it everyday, several times a day to keep the screen clean and about once a week for the pencil. Nothing is better for wiping the sweat from your face on the golf course or removing fingerprints and dirt from you iPad and pencil. Wash it as instructed and it gets even better."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0155KDJWA", "review": "For the many reasons I state below, the IPad Pro (I have a 2ng Gen 32GB) and most likely all IPads, is pretty much a  piece of junk.  I have owned and used mine daily for about two years, so I know what I'm talking about.  I can tell you without question, it will not play a majority of web embedded video content out there, not including the adds of course.  They always play wither you want them to or not. It doesn't make a difference what website you go to; Google, Yahoo, any major news network... and many YouTube videos simply will not play.  I don't know if it is because they use flash technology (known to be a non-starter in all Apple products) or what, and frankly it doesn't really matter. They don't play!  You had better not buy it for it's multimedia power and flexability, which strikes me as outrageous, because Apple pushesit just that way.  In the real world it is not.  The system freezes for a few seconds or completely from time to time, often requiring a hard reboot.  The iOS (\"i\" stands for irritating) was recently updated to the the newest version 11.0 and I had hoped that it would fix this bug, but no such luck.  The system constantly updates apps automatically and you have zero option to disable this 'feature'.  The resulting bottom-line is that if you have apps you like and are accustomed, tomorrow that will change. You might as well lick an electric fence rather that attempt to link it up with, or transfer data from, a non Apple product.  The Apple echo system all but requires 'rebel' systems to load bulbous, confusing, tracking, and lethargic iTunes in order to \"easily\" (their tainted vocabulary) transfer anything to for from non Apple products.  This includes interaction with local  network shares.  If it weren't for an app called Feem I'd have flung myself off the nearest overpass a long time ago. The display dazzle for all apps is by Apple specification, anemic, and the general flexibility is arthritic.  If you are looking for an app similar to something you have done a thousands of times on any Android system and you can't find one, give up.  It is probabily an Apple no-no.  Frankly, if it weren't for the fact that there are so few tablets out there with a large quality display and great sound, my memory of ever owning an iPad wound be quire faded by now.  Alas, it was purchased as a sheet music and mp3 tracks player for professional gigs and for this single purpose, it has no equal.  Still, getting pdfs and sound tracks loaded onto this thing gives me hemorrhoids.  I pray to the digital Gods on High, PLEASE develop a Linux Tablet!"}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0155KDJWA", "review": "My artist wife and I have been using apple products since the late 80's. Over the years we have purchased them less and less because of design flaws such as the one most evident here. She has worked on an ipad 2 with a cracked screen for 6 years. When planning an overseas project  she determined it was time for an upgrade. She purchased an ipad Pro 256 so she could avoid taking her 9 year old powerbook. What an expensive  disaster this decision proved to be. Apple assumes their users all work within the first world tech bubble with a laptop by their side- so that itunes or cloud is always present. An arrogant assumption. When one's 10 day old ipad pro automatically disables itsself because  jetlag prevented her from typing in the correct pw after 6x she has no options. This has happened to others because their child was playing on it. However it happens the only way to recover the device is a factory reset...which is a PIA wherever you are, but particularly frustrating when working in a place where the cloud is not very accessible. What does applecare say? I'm sorry. Gee, that's not what the genius bar used to say. They would make it right.\n\nThis is a disaster for her project- the only thing being worse would have been if she had lost a month of creative research before this happened. Who cares about the incredible retina display if it now exists in her studio as a flat gray paper weight? Her six year old ipad 2 is still going strong. She has it with her as well ans has never had these problems with it because if she misplaced it she could call it or temporarily lock it via the \"list my iphone\" app. Apple is creating this idiocracy by taking removing user control and creating this type of idiocy. Such a waste. We once loved itunes.\n\nDo not buy this product for travel or expect to use it without access to another apple product by your side. Without constant internet there is not a solid way to back up data or do business."}

Its my go for homework, scheduling my everyday life, and all my entertainment needs. I also purchased the Smart Keyboard and Apple Pencil which makes the IPad Pro perfect for school."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0155KDJWA", "review": "Although a reliable product, I will never buy Apple products again for the fact they try to squeeze as much money out of you and make life so inconvenient. Do you want to use an external device to expand storage? Forget about that, you need to pay for a monthly cloud service. Do you want to watch videos online that use flash? To do so, you will need to pay for a browser that is not safari. Do you want to transfer photos from your camera to your device? You need to pay extra money to buy a USB or card reader dongle and files from the device cannot be transferred to the SD card. Do you want to hook the device up to your tv for use? Once again, you have to pay extra for an HDMI dongle or get Apple TV. Keep in mind, all these dongles you get you have to keep track of too. Do you want to transfer photos or other files to your Microsoft desktop that you have too many of or are too large to email? Good luck researching ways to get this too work. Do you want to stick with devices where auxiliary ports are being phased out for no good reason? Have fun draining your battery faster using Bluetooth or keeping track of the dongle and have fun replacing all of your non Bluetooth headphones. The one good thing about the devices are how reliable they are but in my case this is a negative since I am waiting for it to die as an excuse to switch to the surface pro. Those that continue to buy Apple I have determined to do so for the same reason people buy Gucci, Prada, and other overpriced brands; for the attention whether it be good or bad attention."}

I enjoy having Siri on the Pro.  She brings up my apps quickly and I don't have to rummage through my folders to find things.  I bought the gold tone model and it is beautiful.  However, my cover, unfortunately hides it.  I read other reviews that stated they got the wrong size or that iPad didn't even work.  I was hoping I would not have this problem and thankfully I didn't.  I looked up at the Apple website how to set up the iPad Pro before I even got it and it went very smoothly.  With my iPad 2, I had to connect to the computer and bring up the iTunes store to get the Safari browser to get set up. Didn't have to do this at all this time."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0155KDJWA", "review": "Ive had my iPad Pro 12.9 (256gb) since around Thanksgiving of 2016. My hand-me-down MacBook Pro was dying on me and instead of replacing it with another laptop, I decided to try the iPad Pro. I knew a regular iPad would feel too small as a laptop replacement & I was also afraid that the regular iPad wouldnt be able to handle everything I wanted to throw at it (word processing, web browsing and photo editing). The iPad Pro has been a great replacement & Im loving it more every day. It does everything I wanted it to do and Ive reached the point where I don't miss having a computer at all. I just recently bit the bullet and invested in the Smart Keyboard and Apple Pencil. I wish I would have bought them sooner because right now there is not a single thing I wish my iPad could do that it doesnt already do.\n\nPros:\n- Size makes it a smoother transition for someone who wants a laptop replacement, but still small enough to throw in a bag or large purse\n- Everything moves lightning fast & you can easily switch between apps without slowing anything down\n- Battery lasts a long time\n- Display is great for watching movies or looking at/editing pictures\n- Touch screen is responsive enough that I was able to easily type emails and social media posts before I had the Smart Keyboard\n\nCons:\n- Cost of accessories. I actually think the Smart Keyboard and Apple Pencil make this iPad the complete package and everyone should have them, but the price makes that hard"}

I've owned the 2nd generation iPad, the 1st generation Air, the Nexus 7 (2013), the Asus Transformer Prime (TF-201), Cheap knockoff Android Tablets, and the Surface Pro 3. It puts all of them to shame.\n\nI held off from buying the iPad Pro (1st gen) for a long time. I waited for the 2nd gen to come out, hoping the original's prices would drop. Hey, I was still using a first gen iPad Air, and happy with it, after all. Anyway, the iPad Pro is quit an amazing piece of technology. It's huge, yet lightweight. It runs games without any hiccups or stuttering. The screen is super sharp (just don't put a matte finish screen protector on it). I haven't been able to put it down since I received it. The Surface Pro 3 is now collecting dust. If you are one of those guys or gals that always wants the latest and greatest, save some money and get the first gen iPad Pro instead! You won't notice much a difference in performance."}

I would recommend getting the fast charger and usb c to lighting cable from apple, that way it won't take hours to fully charge the tablet from 0 to 100 percent. It also helps so that your tablet doesn't run out of juice while using it. There has been a couple of times when im using it to take notes and do homework while connected to the charger that came with the box and it died on me. So in my opinion the fast charge charge and cable from apple are a must for this IF you are using it for drawing and or for college."}

Battery now works for only 3 hours. Apple refuses to repair because it does not cover the warrantee from Amazon. Now we are screwed after paying full price 5 months later."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0155KDJWA", "review": "My boyfriend is an Apple lover and I prefer Android. I have a Google Nexus 7 that I love, but it's small. However, it was the iPad's 12.9\" display that sold me on this version and the ease of setup and use that sold me on the iPad in general.  Apple's reputation also sealed the deal.\n\nWhen doing a side-by-side comparison, I seriously considered the 9.7\" iPad Pro with its wide color and true tone display because that offers a richer viewing experience. Also, the 12-megapixel camera of the 9.7\" produces more vibrant photos with better resolution than the 8-megapixel pictures taken with this 12.9\" iPad Pro. Nevertheless, the large screen on this 12.9\" is best for me.  Portability was not an issue because I got this for home use to watch videos and to easily type on the larger virtual keyboard. I've had it for over one month now and love it. Set-up was a cinch. Battery power is also excellent and lasts for over 10 hours.\n\nThe one negative that I noticed is that Apple does everything in its power to control their users. For instance, I had to wipe out the \"sent from iPad notice\" when sending an email as I do not want to freely advertise for them. I also dislike how all my boyfriend's iPhone messages that use to go to my Gmail account, now landed only in iMessage on my iPad and none went to Gmail.  At first I thought he was mistaken when he told me he was sending me messages and I no longer got them until I discovered them a day later on the iPad. This required I only use the iPad until we both figured out how to correct that. Nevertheless, I consider this a small annoying price to pay for what is a user friendly device that provides a rewarding viewing experience.\n\nIn addition to this iPad, I decided to purchase the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/amPen-hybrid-stylus/dp/B008MOHLVC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">amPen  hybrid stylus </a>&nbsp;instead of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Apple-Pencil/dp/B016NY7784/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Apple Pencil</a>&nbsp;because I did not need the precision of the pencil. Also, since I am periodically using this for watching videos, I purchased the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/ZUGU-CASE-Prodigy-Exec-Thin-Wake-Sleep-Stand-Protective-Case/dp/B00PB2BF56/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">ZUGU CASE Prodigy Exec Thin Wake / Sleep Stand Protective Case</a>&nbsp;which fits it perfectly and props the tablet up as high or low to the surface of my desk as I want it. Note that the ZUGU case will not work with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Apple-Smart-Keyboard/dp/B0186RZAWQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Apple Smart Keyboard</a>; this keyboard acts like its own case. Thankfully, the virtual keyboard was enough for me.\n\nEventually, I'll teach myself more about my iPad via the online manual I downloaded. I love it so much that if my Google Nexus ever fails, I might just purchase the more portable 9.7\" iPad Pro for when I want to carry around a tablet (which is infrequently)."}

I ordered a refurbish iPad and I was in love with it when I saw it, but then the nightmare began.  After setting it up I immediatly starting have problems.  The first thing it did was that a screen came up saying my machine was disabled and I could do nothing about.  I called apple and after two hours my iPad was working.  I played one movie and it was okay, not great.  The next movie I tried the sound was terrible.  I tried another and same result.  I tried some of apts and same results, it was still not right.  I tell my wife that I take an hour to figure out what do, when other people do it in 5 minutes. Had lots of problems with passwords and was very frustated and new that I had gotten a lemon.  Amazon as usual was very good about taking it back, but now I am wary of buying a refurbished or even one marked new from one of their buyers. Another thing i found out was telephone numbers are hard to find for these type of problems, at least it was for me.  Now I really want one even though I had these problems.  I use my iPad that I have now  for about 4 years every day for at least 7 hours a day. I am hooked and what am to do?  I  forgot to mention that my screen said I did not have a SIM card. Sounds like I am a little cranky this morning but at 83 who wouldn't be."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0155KDJWA", "review": "Recently, I bought an iPad Pro as a Christmas present. SLS Deals claimed that the iPad I paid a large amount of money for was brand new and in the packaging. A couple of nights ago I was wrapping gifts, and I came across a handwritten note in the box. The note claimed that whoever had bought this iPad before me had sent it back. Therefore, I was concerned and checked inside the box containing the iPad. It was not packaged in plastic and had dirty finger prints all over the aluminum side. The charger that comes with the iPad was also dirty and not in the packaging. At this point I was ready to return the iPad, but I thought if the iPad contained no information it would be okay because cleaning the exterior is not a problem. So, I began to charge the iPad to see if it was wiped clean of information. I started setting up the item, and it seemed wiped but when I got to entering my Apple ID it did NOT work. The iPad alerted me that that there was already and iCloud account connected to this iPad and without its password I was not allowed to open the iPad. I was very angered by now because this present was expensive and I paid for it to be new. On Christmas Morning, today I called apple and asked if there were anything I could do to open this iPad, Apple claimed they could not tell if the iPad had be stolen, therefore they could not help us in anyway. So, my next idea was to call Amazon. Amazon's customer service told me that SLS Deals had claimed it was new and lied to me. The Amazon customer service was extremely helpful and are going to give me a full refund when I return the iPad. This is why you should never spend your hard earned money on SLS Deals, they are only trying to scam you."}

Because the picture is so big, it just magnified the graininess. I also bought the slim Zagg keyboard case to use with it & it's perfect together. The keyboard is sturdy & well-built. The cover for the iPad is a thin plastic, which I was disappointed about because my iPad Air2 Zagg keyboard case is very sturdy & good protection. But when it's all hooked together by the magnets in the iPad, it's very secure. Just not sure if it will be ok as a cover apart from the heavier keyboard. But I will probably keep it hooked up. It's like having a touchscreen computer, which is what I had hoped for. It's still easy to use portrait view as well. I would rather have this than any of the MacBooks. The speed is great. Much better than my iMac. And the best thing over the MAC computers is that the price of apps are so much better!! I found out the hard way getting a IMac, that apps cost way more on a computer than they do on an iPad or iPhone: good, free apps on the iOS, cost $$ on the Mac. Of course, there are some things you must have an actual computer for that the Pad & Phone can't do, but most of what I need, such as the internet, works just great.\nThe iPad is big but light & thin, which I really like. Very portable & easy to hold at length.\nAnd the company USA SupplySource, I ordered through with Amazon was great. Came right on time in 2 days & no damage to the box or the product. Came by carrier & not post office.\nSo I'm highly pleased & satisfied. "}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0155KDJWA", "review": "I love Apple's iPad Pro 12.9 inch.  This is an upgrade from my iPad 4 and the difference is huge.  I also ordered the Logitech Create Backlit Keyboard Case.  The keyboard was an essential part of my decision to buy.  The iPad 4 would accommodate a blue tooth keyboard, but it lost the connection often.  The iPad Pro has contacts for connection with a keyboard that never lose contact.  The magnet keeps the keyboard and iPad Pro connectors properly lined up and it works perfectly.  For people who prefer to not have keyboard/case, the 12.9-inch version of the iPad Pro is still quite manageable.  If you are considering an upgrade from an earlier iPad, the larger iPad Pro will be worth the investment.  If you have an iPad 4 and prefer the smaller display, I would not make the investment for the iPad Pro 9 inch.  The major factor in my decision was that I wanted the larger display and I am not disappointed."}

Some songs started out with base, but then changed and did not sound as good as my iPad 4th generation. I did like using the larger keyboard! The picture was not much better than previous iPad. The split screen was okay to use. It was awkward to hold with the Roartz case I bought from Amazon due to the size. When I set up using iCloud, it brought up my old username and I had to call Apple. Because of other problems, I reset it and then old username came up again. Also, all of my music did not download, only less than half. I used iTunes instead and still had some problems. I did not like setting up as new iPad and eventually returned to a local Apple store. Also, when it first starts up, they really want you to use Apple Pay and fingerprint. Surprisingly, it was not hard setting up the fingerprint. A few other crazy things went on with this iPad, so I could not keep it!  I wanted to try the smaller one, but did not want to go through same problems. I decided to order both 6S phones yesterday, of which I had previously returned the largest one.

I was worried about the size after reading some reviews and debated about the 9.7 but after having the 12.9 for a few days and using it I can say that I am really liking the larger screen.  No...you can not easily tuck in a purse but I have a kindle for that!  I can prop against a pillow in my lap to use...whether it is reading or using the pencil with it.  This tablet works with Wi-Fi or Cellular so for the price it was worth it.  I couldn't buy it this cheap at the store  The only complaint I have is that I wished I had more time to use it!!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0155KDJWA", "review": "Well, first off, it is Apple.  Then it sports 9X processor which was the fastest until IPhone 7 anyways.  Then it has powerful graphic processing power.  Flawlessly for gaming and entertainment.  Sound quality is great for streaming music and movies, display is great but could be better. However, don't buy into Apple accessory casing and keyboards...they are a rip off.  I only needed the tablet, and so I grabbed cheap full case with smart feature from ESR, and I am very happy.  Heart stone and Vainglory games are excellent on the IPad Pro 12.9\".  I never thought of doing \"pro\" works on this tablet, but more like an oversized entertainment tablets to me, and I personally loving it.  Will be waiting for Pro 2 which is coming soon.\n\nOn top of that, Apple always take care of it customers."}

It worked fine and I liked the screen display quality but it just died today. I am very careful with my things and I took very good care of this. This was used primarily for school (notability).\nIt had 100% charge when I left home. Used it for notetaking and audio recording during a 2-hr lecture. I came home and it still had 80% when it started acting up. It would only stay on briefly after pressing the button. I was able to reset it and it seemed to work and I then connected it to the charger while I wasn't using it but when I checked on it approximately an hour later, it showed 45% power. I thought I must have misread the \"80% power\" earlier. When I checked again 3 hours later, the ipad was just dead. It wouldn't turn on even a split second. Reset attempts were unsuccessful. So disappointed!!!! I have 3 exams next week and all my notes and most of the lectures were recorded on this thing!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0155KDJWA", "review": "I have the iPad Pro 12.9 inch 128gb with cellular and wifi (from sprint) I purchased the iPad in store knowing it'd end up being much more expensive than on the apple website. I had a $200 up from down payment and I pay $44 a month for two years. It comes to about $1400 at the end of it, plus continuing to pay for service, just like any other device with the cellular. So.. With knowing that, I bought it because i knew this would be an amazing tablet. I was so wrong and so right. It's really not a tablet.. Like Apple says, it's a super computer. And it really is. I've had kindles, android tablets, other iPads, touch screen laptops, and other products. This beats all of them by miles and miles. I bought this along with the Apple Pencil. I've had these products for 8 months now and to this day when I pick it up and use it, I'm still amazed. I'm amazed at how beautifully it runs, how sleek the design is, how smooth it runs, how big and bright the screen is, how crisp the sound is, and it's just pure enjoyment. The one and only thing I have as a slight complaint is it doesn't get quite as bright as the other iPads, but I understand why. It'd kill the battery and make the iPad bulkier if they put a different display on, so with that said, I'd like to see another company come and make a gadget such as this with that brightness; then you can talk. This iPad is just an all around wonder. I don't think apple is going to be able to top this. At all. I really don't. And I say that both because my uncle is Ronald Wayne (co founder of certain areas in apple) and despite what the media says, he is still very involved with the business. He helped create this, and yet I'm still paying $1400 haha. But I also say that because this really is top of the line and you're just not gonna be able to compete. That's all.. Point. Blank. Period. And that's my review."}

There's too much other crap out there to buy I'm sick of computers and phones anyways. Ya know, it's something to get excited over, I do love iOS gaming, I am willing to check out the drawing stuff, I will get the pencil probably next summer, the sounds like I said is satisfying enough, the screen is big, it hooks up to the keyboard so nicely.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0155KDJWA", "review": "Best investment I ever made. So heres why I purchased this. I already have a desktop computer, my powerhouse that I built myself, so I wasn't really looking for a computer. I am in school and am going for software development, which means I like to draw my own material for apps and stuff. I also take notes in school for various classes. I could have bought the cinitque 13hd, but that was expensive. I could afford it, but I just felt like taking notes on a 1500 DRAWING TABLET, was not cool. Plus I wanted to do other things with my tablet, the works, not just draw or take notes, i wanted to watch movies, play games, and browse the web in stunning hd. So then i thought of the surface pro 4. Okay, so now Im going to have two computers? Thats what I did not want...I already have a desktop...just want an amazing tablet. Thats why the Ipad pro is so amazing. You see, the surface pro 4 is a laptop, trying to be a tablet. The ipad pro is tablet trying to be a laptop. That is exactly what I wanted. I can draw, take notes, watch movies, play games, take photos....at a much lower price too.\n\nThe drawing\nThe drawing on this is an amazing experience. The pressure levels are right there, better than the cintique hd. The tilt feature superb. I love how you can shade with it and blend things. The pencil feels way better than ANY stylus (surface pen, cintique pen). Taking notes is easy too...i use onenote for taking notes, and it rocks. No latency, or none that i can detect anyway.\n\nAmazing tablet. Great for everything. Best purchase ever. Would I buy again?? Absolutely without a doubt in my mind, I would buy over and over! This thing is a powerhouse, never lags, never freezes, never glitchy. I would so buy it over any other tablet, and believe me I did my research fron tab s2 to surfaces, to note pro w/stylus to google nexus tabs. Nothing beats this!!! Also, make sure you get the apple smart cover and case. I know its a little more money, but so worth it. Its like a body glove. Full protects it and looks great."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0155KDJWA", "review": "Just to preface this review, I owned the 9.7 iPad Pro before I got the big guy:  the 12.9.  Like many, I was convinced by the countless online reviews all basically saying, \"Buy the 9.7.  The 12.9 is nice and big, but the 9.7 is a far more polished product:  Truetone display, better cameras, more portable, etc. etc.  Wait until a few more models come out and the tech has caught up to buy this monster.''\n\nSo I bought the 9.7, and it was awesome.  I loved it.  Then, after 2 months, it was stolen.  I got an insurance check that covered the loss and thought, why not try out the 12.9?  Basically free at this point.  If I didn't like it I could just return it and get the 9.7 again, nbd.\n\nSo I got the 12.9 128gb with WIFI and LTE.  And it was even better--so much better in fact, that you couldn't pay me to go back to the 9.7.  Ladies and gentlemen, this thing is a bonafide game changer.  The smaller version hardly compares. Shop at the right place and you can get this for virtually the same price too.  Think of it this way:  you're shopping for a TV, and the salesman comes up to you and says, \"We've got a 47' flat screen plasma for $630, but If you want, I'll sell you this 82' Plasma for just 40$ more.\"  It's a very easy choice to make.  Go big, or go home.  Take advantage of the fact that the bigger format has not yet taken off, and you can find it discounted down to the price of the standard size iPad Pro because this is a trend that will not last.\n\nTo anyone that says the 12.9 is bulky/not portable, that is simply untrue.  It's as thin as an iPhone and barely weighs more than a stack of printer paper of the same thickness.  Whoever says, \"you might as well just be carrying a laptop everywhere,\" that is a woeful exaggeration.\n\nThe Apple Pencil, with either model, is a must buy accessory.  This addition is what sets the iPad Pro apart from any other tablet on the market.  It has a more natural, tactile feel than any stylus on the market (looking at you Surface and Galaxy Note), but it was made for the bigger version.  With the bigger version, the Apple Pencil is a legitimate tool, and a great one at that.  With the smaller version, the functionality of the pencil feels more like a toy--very cool, but more limited just by nature of the smaller work space, like an elementary school desk V. full size executive wrap-around.\n\nNow, to those who say, \"The camera's not as good on the bigger model, and the iSight camera's definitely not as good.\"  Look, just use your smart phone.  I know you have one.  I moonlight as a photographer, so take it from me, it is worth taking photos or video On some other device and having this massive, beautiful screen to edit them.  Plus, you don't want to be 'that guy' walking around holding a tablet in the air trying to get your master shots; no one will take you seriously.  Spielburg's not shooting his next block buster on any tablet, no matter how good the camera, and if you're an artist, you want the bigger view finder; the extra 4mp makes no difference.\n\nAs for the rest, the sound is not only louder, it's also better.  Size-wise, the bigger model actually feels better in terms of ergonomics--fits perfectly and securely across your lap in absence of a table or working surface and eliminates need to balance on a knee, squeeze your legs together, or even hold in the air, as was my experience on the smaller model, which makes the argument that \"it's just too big to be comfortable holding for long periods of time,\" a moot point.\n\nBattery life is better.  Bigger screen makes anything related to reading, watching, gaming, editing, typing, etc, better on the 12.9.  With the smaller model, the on screen keyboard is an awkward size, too big to use your thumbs like a smart phone/too small and cramped to type as with a traditional keyboard, and even the blue tooth keyboards (I've used apple and Logitech) feel small, cramped, and inefficient (unless you have very small hands I suppose).  This was one of the biggest limitations I had with the 9.7.  In contrast, with the larger one, the onscreen keyboard is big enough to get meaningful work done if you need to, past the capacity of quick text messages, and if you opt for a keyboard, the ones built for the 12.9 are basically the same scale as your typical laptop, offering a very easy transition.  My opinion:  get the Pencil for sure, but give the onscreeen one a chance before spending that extra 100$ on a keyboard case, which effectively doubles the size of this sleek machine.  I bought one at the same time I got the iPad, thinking I'd use it.  I don't.  Like, at all, and I type all the time.  But the onscreen keyboard is good enough that having another keyboard is simply redundant.  I typed this entire review with no help from a Bluetooth keyboard.  My guess, Apple developed the smart keyboards because they knew people would ask, and pay the extra money for them, not because they thought people would need them.\n\nSo-in summary, do yourself a favor. Get the 12.9, NOT the 9.7."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0155KDJWA", "review": "It's fast and capable.  It's very comparable to the macbook air 13 2012 edition (which also had a 128gb ssd, and 4gb of system ram) that went to my wife, when paired with a Logitech keyboard.  I love the  pen support and ability to draw on the screen.  I really love being able to mock UI designs using OmniGraffle in a few minutes.  I'm toying with building actual websites with Coda using it.  Within a few hours I find myself wanting to reach up and touch my macbook pro's screen whenever I want to do something when moving back to it.  It's a very addictive experience, and I just end up in a different mental space while using it.  And that experience is making me look hard at porting more design tools over to it, because especially with the pen, this is where I work on ideas, and my pro is where I actually code them.\n\nI've found that making presentations on it is wonderful.  I've even done a at his desk presentation for my Director using it, and the new speakers really filled his office.\n\nI also find that it's adequate for quick impromptu meetings as both a place to capture what would normally be done on a white board (it's big enough for people to watch what you're drawing).\n\nIt's awesome for watching movies while you cook.  Again the new speakers really help with that.  Also if you're baking and you know your hands are going to be covered with dough or something, covering the screen and keyboard case with saran wrap really works.  You can still touch the screen, and you don't have to worry about cleaning it later.\n\nI just installed IOS10 on it (this was a birthday gift, I know new one's are coming out, but what can I do, I got the device when I got it, and I'm not going to return it just because the next one might be even more awesome than this one) and it's just amazing.  The swipe left view has my calendar, reminders, omni-focus task list, and some custom widgets I coded up in x-code real fast to display health status, and boil up any alerts from our Splunk service.\n\nHonestly it is a great device on it's own.  If you have the ability to code, it's just amazing.  If this thing had the ability to do Swift/Objective-C or C# code development (I work for a school district, all our back end stuff is in C#, and a good third of our front end stuff is for macOS/iOS, the rest is all web apps, although if something like Electron started supporting ARM that might shift entirely to web technologies on the front end...  So yes, as it stands now I do need the ability to do both), I might even be able to leave the laptop at home while on vacation, and just bring this.  Tools like Coda give me hope that this day is coming sooner rather than later."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0155KDJWA", "review": "An owners honest opinion on this iPad (I was not compensated for this review).\n -  I have owned three iPad's since their iconic release on January 1st, 2010.  Apple's most recent iPad, the12.9 inch iPad Pro, is the largest IPad to date.\n\n -  Screen:  The iPad Pro 12.9 has a beautiful, 12.9 inch Retina LED-backlit Multi Touch display.  It's above HD resolution, coming in at 2732 by 2048  and 264 pixels per inch (please see below for the pictures of this glorious screen).  The down side is this screen is like carrying around a small tv.  It's awkward if you try to hold it to watch videos or films.  The iPad itself isn't terrible heavy, 1.59 lbs, but over time holding it will become annoying (I suggest a laptop style case that allows the iPad to be protected and propped up).\n\n - Performance:  This iPad is lightning fast.  The screen is very fast and responsive.  The Apple Pencil works great and responds faster than the Microsoft Surface Pen (I have owned both).  The iPad has 4 GB of system RAM (the most of any Apple mobile product) and Apple's fast and responsive A9X chipset with a 2.26 GHz Dual core (Twister) processor and a PowerVR Series 7 (12 Core Graphics) Graphics Processing Unit (per[...]).  This is a very powerful machine, however it is not a laptop.  And, while its close to being able to replace a laptop, the Surface Pro does a better job at this.  Yet what the Surface Pro lacks is in the inter-connectivity of Apple.  I can be working on the iPad and take a call on my phone.  I can view a article on safari on the phone and send it to the iPad to view it on a larger screen.  I can send texts, review notes, etc.  It's not a laptop, but it's the closest an iPad has ever come to being as powerful as a laptop.\n\nCamera:  The front facing FaceTime camera is the same camera as in previous models (1.2 MegaPixel HD camera with Face detection and HDR (high dynamic range).  It also has an 8 MegaPixel rear camera similar to the camera on the iPhone 6 Plus just with a slightly larger appaliture (31mm, f/2.4 iPad Pro vs 29mm f/2.2).  Using the iPad for recording, pictures, etc is definitely possible, yet because of its size it's extremely cumbersome.  Your phone would work better in this instance.  FaceTime however is awesome on this iPad due to the size of the screen and the quality.  All in all, if you are using this primarily for the camera, I wouldn't.\n\nWriting / Drawing:  The Apple Pencil is marvelous.  Very accurate and spot on.  The downside is it isn't included ($100 additional).  It also has a built in battery so you will have to replace it at some point.  The charge is pretty great, and it seems to last some time.  Its also very quick to charge (10 - 12 minutes). That being said the pencil is great and easy to use.  There are plenty of apps for drawing and writing.  The larger screen really helps to bring out the pencils abilities.\n\nBattery Life:  with a 10, 307 mHA battery, this iPad can go the distance.  It is rated for up to 10h (moderate to heavy use).  Considering the screen size and the power of the iPad this is a great feat.\n\nOverall:  I gave this iPad 4 stars because for all of Apple's claims for this to be as powerful as a laptop, it is not quite there.  It has many features over the Surface Pro that makes is a viable companion (battery life, better pen drawing/writing, great apps, and beautiful screen / performance hardware).  What it lacks is the ability to run Mac OS to be able to use full versions of software supported by Mac OS.  It does not include a stand, pencil or keyboard (all sold serparalty).  All that being said, it is still the most beautiful, high performance iPad I have ever owned.  Apple has a long way to go to replace your laptop with an iPad.  But they are taking the right steps in the right direction to do so.  If you are looking for an iPad that (with the right accessories and apps) can come close and is highly portable, then this is the iPad for you.  I hope this review helps!  Thanks!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0155KDJWA", "review": "I've had my iPad Pro for about 3 weeks now, and I have to say I love it. At first it was too big, it just seemed drastic for someone who is going to use it for Netflix and Facebook. I am by no means a pro and I don't need it for school or work, it simply to enjoy mysel. When I got used to the size I realized how much I loved it, I realized how small my iPhone is, I realized how small my sons iPad Air is, I realized I couldn't imagine having anything smaller. I have since bought a zagg slim book and it's brought out even more of the iPad pros potential. I enjoy reading, watching movies, catching up with friends, writing friends and even skimming Facebook.\n\nThe only cons I can think of\n1. I wish it had a USB port for an external hard drive or even a flash drive port\n2. Would be amazing if it had an hdmi port\n3. Expandable memory would be nice but not too important\n4. Weight could be a tad better, sometimes I notice when I'm tired how heavy this beast can be lol\n\nOverall I am very pleased with my iPad, with about 3 weeks of heavy use under my belt I have no complaints. My oldest loves his iPad Pro as well, he's been trying to talk me into getting an Apple Pencil, I told him we shall see. Thank you for reading and I hope I helped in any way"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0155KDJWA", "review": "I've had my eye on this IPad since its introduction.  IMO Apple has always led the pack for consumer products for graphics and audio, so its main use for me will be music composition.  I used a much smaller IPad several years ago and the difference is just astonishing.  With a 12.9\" screen its just smaller than my laptop screen.  As far as I'm concerned bigger is better, and this IPad Pro is clearly better!  I shared some time with a fellow musician last night and there was no issue of either of us crowding out the other.  I won't go into all the specs of the IPad Pro, you've certainly read them before... I paired this with the Logitech Create Keyboard, which does duty not only as a keyboard but also a stand and a hard shell case.\n\nSetup out of the box could not have been easier.  I connected it to my wifi signal, gave it my AppleId login information, and let it perform a software upgrade.  Using all of its capabilities will take me some time to learn (I'm a Windows guy) but Siri promises to be there whenever I need help.\n\nIf you've been waiting to see what other people are saying about the IPad Pro, let me say \"It's one Fantastic Tablet, without equal!\""}

I couldn't be more pleased."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0155KDJWA", "review": "Great Ipad but not even close to a computer...please stop calling it a computer!!!!\n\nI bought an Ipad Pro 128GB, 4G LTE, model with the keyboard and pencil the day it came out and have used it in place of a computer for over six months until I finally got fed up of the features it lacked and went out and bought a new macbook pro retna.  Don't get me wrong this is an excellent product but it is maybe 70% of a computer depending on your needs.  First off the screen is fantastic and so is battery life, with the available keyboard accessory it truly can do a lot of things that were more difficult on my Ipad Air2.  However iOS is not up to par with a full blow Operating System.  The split screen app feature or multitasking is a good first attempt but is not polished enough to make it useful.  For example if you are doing something in Youtube and you want to open a second app, the youtube video stops playing.  What is the point of having multitasking available if my first app stops playing while opening up my second app.  Another disappointing feature is using email, If you want to attach a file from photos or from iCloud, Google drive, or MS onedrive it works great, however if you want to attach a PDF from your iBooks library that is not possible.  I've tried using Apple's mail client, Google's mail client, and MS's mail client, I can't do that in any of them.  I store a lot of PDF files in my iBooks library and it's ridiculous that I can not easily email a non-DRM pdf.\n\nI like Apple's version of MS Office, in other words Numbers/Pages/Keynote, I refuse to pay $70+ a year to lease MS office.  I'm disappointed that some of the most common fonts are not used in both so when I go from my old documents to opening them up my formats are all messed up, hence why I use a lot of PDF's since I don't want and don't need to go back and fix all the formatting issues.  Even though apple products are more expensive to initially purchase then MS devices in my calculations having Numbers/Pages/Keynote makes the total cost of ownership just about even.\n\nThe big issue I have with calling this a computer is all about return on investment.  I spent around $1400 for iPad, applecare, keyboard, pencil, case...for that amount of money I can get a great laptop that has more features.  The current cheapest macbook pro is a joke since it's a little over 4 years old, so really the cheapest mac laptop available starts at 1299(macbook) the macbook is a better buy then the iPad pro.\n\nIf you use a computer/ipad to only consume information and do not create information then don't worry about it falling short of a computer this will still meet your needs.\n\nI bought mine when the max available storage was 128GB, which is not close to what a computer has so I set up my own server(Synology NAS) this way I have all my files/data available to me anytime.  This is has extremely useful to deal with storage limitations.  I also subscribe to a 50 GB monthly iCloud plan, for a buck a month it's worth it however when comparing this to Google Drive, dropbox, and MS onedrive the buck a month is overpriced.  The only reason I subscribe is to have all my iOS devices backed up, however the one time I needed to restore my phone from an iCloud backup(iPhone broke under warranty) the restore failed.\n\nOverall I'm glad I bought it but now since I bought a MacPro Retna and already have an Ipad Air2 I plan to sell it.  If Apple really wants this to be a replacement computer the price would need to drop significantly and the multitasking features would need to get a lot more useful.  Also two things about this drive me absolutely crazy-1 iOS is soooooo slow to boot up, I haven't timed it in a while but this does take longer then my MacBook Pro retain to boot up, and considering the Ipad Air is the flagship Ipad it should have the most current(fastest) finger print sensor.  I'm paying a high premium for a premium device and short cuts such as using the first generation finger print sensor are not acceptable.\n\nTalking about value, I recently bought a new Acer Windows 10 computer with a friend of mine, with the specs it came with, (1920 HD screen, 8 GB ram, 256 GB SSD, Intel i5) and it was only 630+tax from BB using a coupon...for the price it's the best value in a computing device I've ever purchased.  Please don't go crazy saying windows has viruses and such, windows 10 is extremely stable, and windows defender does a fantastic job.  Unless your using torrent websites or searching for XXX material like crazy you won't have virus issues.  I will say that Apple does a much better job with upgrades to the operating system and they are seamless.  Even on Windows 10 I've had a few update issues.\n\nOverall I'm happy with this but for my needs I wouldn't purchase it again.\n\nI hope this helps."}

The Apple IPad Pro has become my main tech device. The upgrades to this model are numerous. First and foremost the picture is extraordinary! Perfect for binge watching my favorite shows. Music sounds better. Apps seem to work better. Faster. Easier. It feels like your holding a truly superior product--not just the latest gimmick.

I think Apple is overpriced and a greedy company.\n\nHaving that aside I was in the market for a tablet which can replace all my books. I wanted an excellent pdf reader and a stylus to annotate on the pdf. I read tons of articles, tech books, publications and instead of wasting paper and buying expensive books I wanted to do it all in pdf. Apple 12.9 is the best in the market I think (I use pdf expert app for my purpose). With apple pencil and  its responsiveness on the ipad pro 12.9, I think this is a great quality combination. I tried Samsung's 12 inch tablet and stylus and the responsiveness in annotating pdf's is just not there. Surface 3/4 is good but they also do not have the best stylus.\n\nCON: Only downside I see is the huge time to charge the device to 100% ( around 5 hours when left idle). Apparently Apple has given only a 12W charger with the ipad. Faster charger can be purchased for some $$. Hate you Apple, as always.\n\nThis may not be a tablet for everyone, but for the purpose I mentioned this is best. Also comes with a great battery life.\n\nPlus I generally get electronics refurbished. Check the pic of the product on arrival. It was like new.\n\n5 stars and more to the vendor \"VIPOUTLET\"."}

It is nice and big and makes it easy to read on it. The touch is very responsive and processing power is great. Even though its specs may not be as impressive as windows devices and intel chips on paper, it works very well with Apple's OS. Real world performance often outshines competing devices. I use it with a smart keyboard and it makes typing on it a breeze. I also use this with the Apple pencil, but have not found it particularly useful for work applications. I usually use it to color or draw. It's a shame that there is no mouse support for iPads. If there were, I think it would completely replace my laptop. As an in-between device (between phone and laptop/desktop) it functions very well. I use it to read, research, word processing."}

I wanted to share this with my wife and have separate access to our emails, apps, etc. This is not possible.\nAlso, it's very nice that Pages and Numbers are included as default apps.

We didn't think the price tag was really worth it, but it's a beautiful big screen, great sound, and we love larger devices. We wanted to give it the opportunity to make us feel like we really enjoyed it and needed it...but it didn't.\n\nIt became obvious pretty quickly that the overlap between our other devices was extreme.\n\n\"Let's watch something on Netflix!\"\n\"Or we could just use our Apple TV on our big screen...\"\n\n\"Let's listen to music!\"\n\"Or let's stream to our Apple TV or Sonos and blast music as loud as we want...\"\n\n\"Let's snap on this keyboard and get some work done!\"\n\"Or let's just open our 15\" Macbooks that are sitting right there, since they'll be much better at handling a bunch of work...\"\n\n\"Hey Siri...........HEY SIRI\"\n\"It's not plugged in\"\n\"Oh. Right, this is like my iPhone 5, I need to plug it in to have her listen to me -.-\"\n\n\"I'm going to read a book...wait just kidding my eyes hurt, let me grab my Kindle\"\n\nAnd so on and so forth. Don't get me wrong, it's a pretty device, it does some cool things, but it falls squarely into the NICE to have and decidedly misses the NEED to have category. We returned it.\n\nWe wanted to like it so much that 6 months later we bought a new one (this one on Amazon) as a business expense since our new business was doing pretty well. We received it, and within the week, we had all the same realizations. This time we got the Pencil and the Apple Keyboard figuring we would get the full experience.\n\nKeyboard - Definitely nice, but not 170 dollars nice.\n\nPencil - Amazing, but unless you are truly creative and doing a LOT of drawing, not that useful. (Only item I considered worth the price though).\n\niPad Pro - Nice, but definitely not worth the price nice.\n\nAnd so we're returning it a second time. We tried and tried and tried, but couldn't make it work. At this price range, you don't expect to be making exceptions every time you need to use it. Things I found myself thinking while using it:\n\n1) Let me take a picture - oh this camera is worse than my iPhone 6S, I should probably just use my iPhone.\n2) Maybe they have some cool 3D touch options in the iPad app - oh there's no 3D touch\n3) Let me tab out a bunch of my work pages so I can review all the information at once - why is this taking so long?\n4) I'm great with keyboard shortcuts, but those few times where a mouse filled the gap are really awkward when you have to start tapping the screen\n5) Oh half the apps I use for work don't do split view? Split view is becoming less useful all the time\n6) Is there really not more to this? - Vast majority of the \"tips\" in the tips app that comes installed are for general iOS related things. Things I've known on my iPhone for a long time, so apparently there really isn't much more that's ONLY on an iPad Pro.\n\nGet this only if you really want an iPad and you = game a lot, draw a lot, watch movies while traveling a lot, need something to do mobile photo presentations, edit a lot of PDFs and documents by drawing on them.\n\nOtherwise, get this only if you literally won't miss the money. It's still nice and a fun option and watching some movies and playing some games on it is definitely cool, but you won't find yourself using it 24/7. It's just a bigger window to browsing the internet."}

Many people think that an iPad is just like any other tablet, but it just costs more. When you hear someone say that, you can be sure that person has never used an iPad.  There used to be a slogan and Apple advertising that said \"it just works\". Never before has there been such truth in advertising as that slogan.  Apple's products are one place where you get what you pay for.  NOw that I have purchased this and the Apple Pencil and had time to play with both, I can say that  The Apple pencil stands alone in terms of the precision and responsiveness when using it. There is virtually no delay on the screen.  However, considering the price point of the iPad Pro 12, I think everyone would agree that Apple would have been better to price it a little fire and include the pencil then to expect their customers to shell out another hundred dollars for the stylus.  Having to pay for the pencil separately and a $100 price point sticks with you and your mind and is the first time I have ever felt as though I was being fleeced by  as though I was being fleeced by Apple.  Not including the pencil with the iPad Pro to me would be the same thing as failing to include ear buds with the iphone.  It is just an accessory that needs to be included, like Microsoft has done with the Surface  Pro.  Still, though, implementation of the Apple pencil with the Ipad pro is so flawless it tricks your mind into believing you are writing on paper."}

The store exchanged it for me, despite the fact I had apparently paid a great price for it and without sales Tax. I appreciate the hard work by staff resolving my issues. As a Grandpa, I am also impressed with the technology, the Stylus, Wi-Fi Cellular, and all its features. I bought a USB-Lightening Drive and iExpnd Flsh Drive, got the Explorer App, 53 Paper and we've only just begun. Very Cool."}

When I say the price,  Brand New with 128G and Free S/H I said he is getting his new IPad Pro And I just ordered it. Then of course I have it only a few days and the suspense is killing me so I have to give it to him. He could not believe it. He loves it so much he is always on it. Always commenting about the size and how awesome it is. He then let's me hold it and I can't believe how lightweight it is. I went with an iPad mini because of all the hand problems I have and even the mini will aggravate it. It seemed lighter then my Mini. He turns around and told me to find another deal like you did mine and get it for yourself. Well I did, the color the GB an the $. So he had me order it so now on the weekends we are like old people playing on I IPad Pros. It's hilarious"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0155KDJWA", "review": "This review is simple. Anyone that has ever touched an iPad knows how well made the are and how simple they are to use. The keyboard connector works great with no lag. I use the Logitech create backlit keyboard and it honestly makes the device feel just like a smaller laptop. I was really excited about the split screen, but was a little let down to find out it would only work with certain apps. Seems to be only work type apps. One feature I really like is the way if I'm watching a movie and need to do something else instead of stopping the movie they shrink it down and puts it in a corner until your your ready to go full screen again. That only leaves the size to discuss and honestly it's bitter sweet. It feels way bigger than an iPad. When I'm using it I enjoy it a little better, BUT I don't use it nearly as much as I have my older iPads because they are so bulky. So if your wanting one to be portable this might not be for you, but that's why they made the new iPad Pro 10."}

However, we wanted a tablet for the house so decided to get an iPad. So far we aren't disappointed. For the most part we only play games on it and it seems adequate for that. I think the only complaint I have is that it's charged with a lightning cable. I have an iPod and so far I've gone through a few lightning cables (they don't seem to last too long). This iPad, sadly, is also charged with a lightning cable. So far the cable that came with it has held up (it's been almost two months), but I still worry it's going to die on us at some point and we'll have to get another one."}

I also would never consider it to be a serious laptop replacement unless Apple choses to allow a mouse / trackpad connectivity. But for someone that uses an IPad as an IPad for surfing, reading magazines, or as a portable tv to drag around the house while doing chores etc... It is terrific. The screen size absolutely brings a whole new dimension to pretty much everything and the on board speakers are plenty loud for viewing from a distance (you will be told to turn them down). Reading local newspapers and finishing homework assignments while sitting on the couch at the end of the day is done without having to zoom in or navigate around the page."}

I feel that Apple is liable and should not have provided that flimsy stand without sufficient warning that it would easily fall off. I really was excited to received this iPad Pro as a gift and really loved the features. Unfortunately, when I had had it only three days it took a dive off of the stand resulting in a face plant on the concrete floor smashing the display. If you buy or receive an iPad Pro be sure and purchase the extra care warranty so that you won't have to pay $600 to replace it when you drop it, because you will drop it.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0155KDJWA", "review": "I was in the air as to whether I should buy the Ipad Pro 12.9, or the 9.7. The 9.7 major difference is the better forward and rear cameras, while the 12.9 gives you more real estate. I am so glad I bought the larger one. I am a heavy gamer and movie watcher, so the larger screen is so much better. Everything I do on this Ipad, from movies and games, to spreadsheets, email, Facebook and Amazon, is so much larger and easier to see. I do not find the extra weight to be a negative. I stiill take this to restaurants when I \"check-in\" on Facebook, and after getting used to the bigger size, it feels normal to me. My wife has the smaller version, and I could not go back to the smaller screen after using this. To me, this is just as portable as the smaller version. The only two things I can specify as negative points, is that videos I have filmed in darker light are not that great, and I seem to misspell alot of words...the keyboard buttons seem to be different somehow from my previous Ipads, as I am constantly pressing the wrong letters. That is a very minor problem, however, and could possibly be software, not sure yet. In any case, if you are geared towards having better photos and video, go for the 9.7.....everything else I would pick the larger 12.9"}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0155KDJWA", "review": "The 12\"  IPAD Pro was very underwhelming.  The retina screen, the speakers, and the pen add up to details that don't deliver a useful product, primarily because of crappy software.  But first, this ipad will probably be useful for some people with specific needs.  Try one out before you buy it!!  I have been spoiled because of owning a number of Apple laptops that were very durable and provided excellent service. They never needed to visit an Apple Store.\n  I found the navigation and 'organization' in the ipad to be clumsy and awkward.  In terms of straightforwardness and simplicity the software design is second rate.  Apple help is not always very useful.  Apparently they expect customers to go to the Apple store, so what do they care. I received the best help by asking my android phone (which has excellent speech recognition) the necessary questions and it responded with immediate and useful help!  Isn't that strange?\n  The retina display is great, the speakers are loud but the sound quality is juvenile, and the pen needs better aps and an eraser. The navigation is really peculiar to me.  I like to see an 'X' in a window.  Click on the 'x' and it's gone, but Apple has come up with a more complicated procedure.  Not a big deal, but I like clean and simple design.  I would have learned the subtleties but the ipad had a bug in the 'mail' software and I sent it back.\n  It seems that Apple provides only a minimum of help because they expect you will go to the Jean-ee-us  bar in order to straighten things out.  This might keep people in the Apple community and might lead to more sales.  But for you economics nerds, this is like leveraging off your incompetence.  In simpler words, people come in to the Apple store because their products don't work or they can't figure out how to use them.  For you very green devotees, if you have to drive to the Apple store every year or so, what does this do to the 'green' equation for Apple products?  I know a number of older folks who visit the stores regularly to solve problems.  This is useful because it's necessary, but the cost of the product includes driving 50 to 100 miles every year for maintenance.  You green environmental economists should include this in the cost of the product.  This may sound foolish but it's not a joke.  It's the truth.\n  I imagine that if there is an Apple car it will have a dashboard button that says 'Apple Store,' which will take you directly to the nearest one.  I would say more but they won't print it."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0155KDJWA", "review": "I bought this as an upgrade from my aging iPad 2. This is a very big improvement. I used my iPad 2 mainly for games, reading, and a little for fun music composition. There are two great improvements I see for this: security ease and it is the perfect size for my preferences to be carried around and effective for writing and notes. I won't be getting rid of my laptop and multiple monitor work station but when I travel or I just want to sit back in an easy chair it is perfect.\n\nThe size: Is it too big? Not for my purposes. I want a decent viewing area where those menus, title bars, and side document outlines don't take up so much space as to really minimize the work area. Its size makes it like carrying around a 12x9 note pad folder. It takes up less space than my laptop and it is useful for most everything I like to do when traveling.\nTwo apps at once: There are two modes of having two apps at once. It may seem like wow what can you do with that. But it is great in transferring data between two apps. No single app really does it all well. The 12.9 screen makes using this work well. Any smaller and I think it would loose its effectiveness.\n\nTouch Id: The touch ID is great. It makes a security log in fast.\n\nSecurity: I am a little security conscience, I use Lasspass for pass words. I did not like using it on iPad or my android phone. Using a clipboard open to all programs can be a weakness. The way the iPad pro works is you have your browser or other app open and lastpass at the same time. So there is a direct link between the apps. Additionally Lastpass works with the touch security, so the app can quickly with a touch be open for you to get a password and it remains secure without it. Also you don't have to type in your password over and over again.\nBecause of how well this works I started looking into cloud sharing, OneNote, Evernote, DropBox, Google, etc. It will make it easy to share and move work between my iPad and Windows. Makes me feel like I was living in the stone age before this. The iPad Pro 12.9 will be nice to work at any where that's not my docking work station.\n\nVoice input: From the iPad 2 where it was not an integrated capability to the iPad Pro where it is great. I like using it for dictation though the spell check and some words can be problematic. There needs to be a faster way to switch between voice and edit fixing.\n\nI think all these features are available on all the latest ipads from Apple but the size of the iPad Pro 2 made it perfect to be part of an electronic paper solution for me.\n\nSome notes on accessories:\n\nPencil: I bought the iPencil because reviews said it is the best. However it is a bit of a pain to use. You have to plug it in to the bottom of the iPad Pro, not a big deal until you find that while it is connected it uses power not just when you are using it. I don use it atleast yet for most of my use. That means I don't use it but I have to check its power and either charge every day or two or I can disconnect it from blue tooth and then put up with having to connect it into the bottom of the iPad to reconnect it.\nFor art applications the pencil is probably the best and worth the extra effort. If its not for art I might suggest getting cheaper stylus until apple makes the connection and power consumption issues less of a problem.\n\nCase: I spent $20 bucks on a brown case (Apple iPad Pro Case by ProCase) which works nicely although there was one issue. The side bezels, cut in spaces to give some room at the center sides of the iPad, where too thin. You need the space at the centers of the edges for iPad functions like split screen, control panel, etc. I could use the vertical top pull down and pull up functions easily enough. However, pulling from the sides was difficult. I did use a curved edge scissors to add room for the fingers and that fixed it. So I was able to make this work. However, if you want a folder case then you might want to spend 50 on a case that has plenty of room on the screen edges.\nNOTE: for any case you might consider, make sure it has room for your finger to touch outside the screen for a starting point at all four centers of the edges. I did not think about this when looking for a case accessory.\nAlso note, cases are not typically compatible with keyboards. So if a keyboard is a must and frequent use you want to just look for a keyboard based cover. I find that the on board keyboard along with voice dictation fits my needs for now. The iPad Pro 12.9 screen is large enough that the keyboard is a nice size and there is still plenty of room for the work space."}

The print is larger so I no longer have to reach for my glasses to read small print.  It worked perfectly from the moment I turned it on.  I watch movies on it, the sound and picture clearness is great on my Ipad. I noticed some reviewers were complaining about the heaviness but since I have the attached keyboard.... I am able to prop the IPad on the keyboard so do not have the problem of holding the IPad upright.  So far I have had no problems with my Ipad Pro and glad I made the purchase."}

I was worried that the size would be an issue, but just like my experience with the Iphone 6 Plus, you'll wonder how you got along all this time with something smaller.  The larger screen size really surprised me in how much it improved the utility - webpages are just awesome in how much content fits on the screen, photos look stunning, video looks like it's on a portable flat screen TV, games are more immersive, and magazines scale to the size of an actual magazine.  It is fast and snappy too, making content smooth and seamless, and the display quality is simply stunning, on par or better than even my 12\" Macbook.  I was also worried about the weight, but I found it not to be too much of a concern -- try before you buy, of course, but for me it wasn't an issue.  Expensive, sure, but Apple does quality and fit and finish like no other and the Ipad Pro is no exception - in my opinion, the extra couple hundred bucks over the Ipad Air 2 / smaller Ipad Pro is totally worth it."}

The apps on iPad pro or week and doesn't work most of the time. And the swipe for iPad pro is just not needed..... Ive been downloading  videos to my device for a long time now with Samsung, At&T and Verizon, but Apple tablets? Even the IPad Pro Thats suppose to be the best? Really disappoints me.  Man I shouldve gotten a Samsung Tablet."}

My android phone is more useful than ipad.\n\nWhile the ipad has good sound, good resolution and the pencil.  Managing your work is a whole other problem.  I have terabytes of storage within my network and the ipad virtually has no or limited tools to access it.\n\nApple almost forces us to use the cloud.  Why would I want to do that when I have all the space I need plus some that I can access 500 times faster than any cloud device.\n\nThe other huge problem is there is no file system on the device.  At least not one that can be access and shared easily, even with other apps on the ipad.\n\nYou should be able to do something simple with ipad that Apple locks you out of.  Example:  Say you want to carry with you just like a thumb drive say 50GB of files for a presentation and software with data.  When you get to your destination your not sure if you will have to do the presentation using your ipad or need to move it to  some other device there.  You can't apple locked you out.  The cloud is worthless because it would take hours if not days to move 50GB over the internet.\n\nMy android phone can do this why not ipad?\n\nIf you are even the little bit of a power user avoid the ipad.\n\nUnless you really need the pencil buy an amazon fire it has more to offer."}

After just opening it, we saw a big and pink line straight in the center of the screen (you can see below) and it is not charging properly. We brought the product apple store in stanbul, Turkey. After they looked up superficially and said to us \"the ipad get a knock\" and we get shocked. t has been just 9 days since we used it. Then, we asked them how they found a solution and they pin the trouble on us and told us they can change the ipad only if we pay extra 662 dollars for it. we have had already paid 879.85 dollars. we still are not sure whether the seller packed the product properly and maybe, the product has manufacturing fault. Please try to give us sensible solution because we are really disappointed with the product. why is the product working normally?"}

The iPad Pro thus far is the same, except a bit faster and much much bigger. It's staggering how large this thing is going from the regular sized iPad. It's a steep price, but if you've been able to use a regular sized iPad for any kind of work related, or productivity related set of tasks; the iPad Pro will certainly amplify the efficiency and available screen real estate to do the same but better. I use this to annotate PDF construction plans on PDF Expert using the Apple Pencil and the experience is unreal in comparison to when I was using my iPad Air 2 with a 3rd party stylus.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0155KDJWA", "review": "I own an original iPad Air and a Macbook Pro.  This a wonderful device and I found it much easier to use than my wife's Surface Pro 4.  Most of what I could do on my Macbook Pro I could do here with two critical items.  I spend a lot of time on my couch working on spreadsheets and budget software.  Although the Excel application works, it is awkward to use a touch screen for individual cells.  Most iOS financial apps have much reduced functionality that means they are a no go for me.  For the home I use YNAB and a Excel spreadsheet for what if budgeting.  YNAB new app has lost some of it's functionality and I have not founde a replace that I'm happy with.  These are software issues that Apple and the third party developers need to fix before this is a true laptop replacement.  There is a lot of potential in iOS and iPad to give hope for the future.\n\nThe longest power cord will not stretch from the wall outlet to the couch so when it runs out of juice between 10-12 hours after starting I need to plug it in.  I have since learned that this is limitation in the cords, not the fault of the iPad Pro.  Apparently there is to much power loss in transmission.  Maybe a more robust cord, like the Macbook Pro has would resolve this issue.\n\nI will not be returning it, but will continue to use.  It makes a great entertainment device with the larger screen making viewing movies and such much more enjoyable."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0155KDJWA", "review": "Since I already owned a IPad Air I knew what I was getting, the big screen is great, the only problem I've had with any of these IPads is the Bluetooth keyboards, I went through 5 before I decided to buy the Pro mainly for the keyboard connection which doesn't require a Bluetooth connection and instant typing.... no having to turn it off and on and rebooting the keyboard...YEY!!!  The keyboard I went with is the Logitech made specifically for IPad Pro, I like it a lot better but I don't like the design, it's too floppy and it weighs more than I like.  If somebody would just come up with a keyboard that is totally encased like a laptop I would like it so much better.  It seems like Apple's expertise doesn't seem to apply to keyboards.  I read the reviews and comments from people who chose the Logitech over the Apple and I decided the comments were more favorable for the Logitech.  If you buy the Pro be sure you try out a keyboard made for it, before you decide.  I'm writing a book so I needed a really reliable keyboard, or I would've stayed with the IPad Air, it worked perfectly, it's just the keyboard was such a daily dose of frustration.  I love the IPad Pro, but do your research before you buy.  It is an expensive investment but worth it if you use it more than a couple of hours a day."}

I am an apple fan, starting with the ipod, then moving up the line thru\nthe years.  Currently I have a macbook air, iphone, ipad mini, ipod and now the Apple Pro.\n\nThings I love:\n\n1)The size.  I do find the Pro to be very awkward to hold, but put it on your lap or table and its a different story.\n2) Download a movie before going on an airplane and watch it on the Pro and you will never again have your electronics jostled by the seat in front of you.....you know what I mean, when you have your laptop just so on your tray table and then the person in front of you reclines his/her seat....\n3) The keyboard -  Adds another dimension to working with an ipad.  I do not think i would have kept this without the keyboard.  The keyboard does take a bit getting used to, but the learning curve is negligible\n4) And the crown jewel - The Pen.  Write, draw right on your screen and everything comes to life.  The Pro would be just a ipad on steriods if you didn't use the pen with it\n\nMy Hates:\n1) - The cost - Unless you are into drawing, graphic design etc.  The Pro is a very large investment for a pimped out ipad\n2) - If only the Pro would run other IOS programs - like Quicken  I would get rid of my laptop in a heartbeat if the ipad could run all the same programs I run on my laptop\n3)  The cost again\n\nI did keep my Pro and I do love it, but then again I do web design.

This all started because my very old laptop took a crap on me. I have an iPhone because I value iMessage and it security. I was comparing the Surface Pro 4 to the iPad Pro. I am a minimal user in terms of computer usage. I use Outlook, Word, Exel, and PowerPoint. I also take pictures with my DSLR. I surf the web and that's about it. However I am going back to school and note taking is something that I want to digitize. I have a degree in mathematics and doing practice problems are helpful. I am using Microsofts OneNote and Word in junction with the Pro's pen is amazing. It's also easy to copy paste it to Apples Notes app and send it via iMessage to fellow peers or email it in the regular form.\nI tried the Surface Pro 4 also but I returned it simply because of the synergy between phone and tablet is so nice. The screen while the same size felt smaller than the iPad Pro. The battery was not as good as what I am getting out of the iPad. I did like the much more advanced software ability the Surface Pro 4 has but ultimately it was synergy and the large catalog of apps.\nThe one down fall is the price 800 dollars starting out or 1000 for the larger RAM is ridiculous and then add the pen for 99 buck which is a must if you buy it. The keyboard is another 170 bucks which I bought but have yet used. I actually may return the keyboard I have used the virtual keyboard mostly. It doesn't have a lot of case options for it which isn't really a big deal.\nIn closing web browsing is amazing and using the pen for notes is a dream. Watching movies, well duh it great too.

They said its size.  The pro is two iPads side-by-side in terms of size. To me, the size is what makes it. I look at my old iPad 2 and it seems puny/ The bigger size gives me an ideal canvas for creative work. Speakers are awesome. Pro is my go to device for everything now. And the pencil is incredible."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0155KDJWA", "review": "Ok, first of all I have to add this disclaimer that I am Apple junkie, I have (or had) pretty much every product they've released. This is just one of those unhealthy addictions, call it collections. In any case, I have iPad mini 4 and iPad Air 2, each serving me a different function. When iPad Pro was released at first I didn't feel like I would need yet another iPad, but after I learned that Apple also released a stylus for it I was intrigued. I love drawing, not a professional, just for fun, and after reading reviews on how accurate the precision is on the stylus - the verdict was clear. And of course Apple made it such that you have to get iPad Pro if you want to use a stylus!! Thanks to the Valentine's Day, I now have my iPad Pro as a gift from my special, and this is where I have to stop and stay: it's just amazing. It's so huge! I love the huge screen, it's absolutely different experience when shopping and browsing. It's very thin and not too heavy for it's size. It's FAST! The screen is gorgeous, pictures look absolutely amazing on it. Lots of great apps for work and entertainment. Watching videos is so much better with extra speakers on every side! And the stylus: it WORKS like a magic. The touch is so precise. The feel of the stylus is just so good, it has a good weight to it, it makes it not wanna put it down! And the precision is amazing, with ProCreate you can literally be a digital artist. I had a Samsung phone or tablet some years ago that came with a stylus and there was nothing remarkable about it that I could remember. But Apple pencil is totally different experience. Yes, it's not a new innovation, but if Apple made it, it must be amazing and it is. The only complaint is that Apple marketing strategy sometimes gets on my nerves: Apple Pencil should come included with iPad Pro just like earbuds included in the iPods! It's unfair to make us pay extra $100 for it when it only works on iPad Pro anyways!"}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0155KDJWA", "review": "How much you like the ipad pro will depend on two things. What you want to use it for and what percentage of your 'toys fund' you're spending on it.  This ipad, despite the \"pro\" label is still very much a toy and that's why I ended up selling mine. Now, that isn't to say it wasn't great for my intended purpose (mobile sketchbook), but in a purely value/utility for the money assessment, it just wasn't worth keeping for me. Your mileage may vary.\n\nI bought the ipad pro with a pretty good understanding of its limitations and capabilities. I've owned a handful of ipads, even ipad/stylus combos, but using older ipads for drawing always seemed like a stretch. I always ended up going back to my paper and pencil sketchbook. By contrast the Ipad Pro was superb in this role. For just over a thousand dollars, I found an overpriced apple pencil on ebay, bought the modal portfolio case, and put a tempered glass screen protector on it. I wanted the glass (and other artists probably will too) because with the pressure sensitive Apple Pencil I just wasn't comfortable applying moderate pressures directly on the screen of the incredibly thin ipad pro. These elements combined for an amazing drawing experience. As a professional artist, I regularly use a cintiq 22hd, and an intuos pro medium tablet. the intuos pros have a little more surface texture but the cintiq is pretty much like drawing on glass, and thats what the ipad pro is like. Some people will probably really hate that, but since I'm very used to it from hundreds of hours on my cintiq, it didn't bother me. The Apple Pencil is an excellent stylus as well, although I sometimes wished it wasn't so slippery. Both devices have the typical Apple level of polish and craftsmanship and you may want to slip one of those old pencil grips on your Apple Pencil to keep it from flying out of your hands. I can't say enough good things about the drawing experience. With Procreate (the accepted standard for mobile drawing in the App Store) I got so used to the undo shortcut-tapping two fingers on the screen-that I would subconsciously try it on my intuos tablet later. In this role, the ipad pro is amazing.\n\nSo why did I sell it? because I've got a clipboard with a hundred sheets of printer paper and a few pencils and pens that do exactly the same thing for around 7 bucks. Granted, in the ctrl-z era of digital art, I will probably always prefer working digitally, but its just not worth it considering premium price and the limitations of the mobile OS. There are a lot of hoops you can jump through to make your device more productive, but you will always be fighting the original intended purpose of the system, which is mobile entertainment.  For a minimum of 900 (ipad+pencil) and tax, there are just better places to put your money if your goal is productivity/asset creation/pre-vis etc. As an artist I spend a decent amount of money on tools, but only budget a little for toys. I tried to justify the Ipad pro as a tool, but as soon as I realized (as I should have from the start) that it was still basically a toy, selling it became the only responsible option.\n\nThe reason I gave this device 3 stars wasn't because anything was broken, or worked particularly poorly, its because using the ipad pro for productivity felt alot like using a karaoke machine to record music. It'll work, and maybe you even make something amazing but. . . you're still playing with toys. A really really expensive toy with 'pro' in the name. The fact that it comes so close to being so much more is mind-numbingly frustrating."}

Some apps that display great and are easy to use on an iPhone don't display and work as well on the iPad pro., including basic Apple apps like the built in spell checker and music player. So be prepared for blood pressure rising frustrations when using the iPad pro with iOS 9.0+ even if you own a late model iPhone. Also, be prepared for short battery life (only 4 hours or so) and very long charging times (6-8 hours)."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0155KDJWA", "review": "Ok ..  If you are an Apple fanboy, you love this device.  Fortunately for me, I received a demo model to test.  To begin with, I'm not a gamer.  My sole purpose for testing this device was for a business environment.  This thing is huge and awkward.  I felt like an idiot pulling this thing out in meetings.  A few friends even chuckled.  It offers nothing new except size.  The Safari browser is still horrible and without a keyboard and mouse the experience is painful.  I won't go into the pathetic functionality of many of the apps I tried because they are as limited and barebones as they are on all the Apple platforms.  The battery life is great.  How can it not be with a battery the size of a floormat. I nearly coughed up a lung when I was informed of the price.  In short, is this it for Apple?  Is this all they have, simply making thier products bigger without a new experience?  What is left for this (I) concept.  At least change the name to a Jpad, add a USB plug and support Flash Player.  At least all the Applejuice drinkers can say they have something new.  You guys are killing my stock portfolio.  At least Android and Windows offers something different a unique with each generation.  I can't wait to see the IPad Pro 2.  It will be as big as cookie sheet and twice as useless.  You probably won't find this review helpful because you already bought the device and you are looking for a reason to justify a dumb decision.  I will admit, the Ipad is the greatest babysitter ever invented.  Particularly when at a nice restaurant and you need to have the kids occupied.  However, this thing is so obnoxious, I may as well carry a flat screen Vizio TV around with me.  Sales are way off and projected forecasts are weak.  I guess the world is running out of simpletons."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0155KDJWA", "review": "I have never had an iPad, so I decided to go for an iPad pro. I thought, finally, something that is worth my money. I'm glad to have waited until now to buy an iPad; due to apple always releasing a new tablet every year, I was always skeptical on purchasing tablets, but this tablet is very nice. It is built with good quality material, the screen is huge, didn't really need a MacBook for what I like to do. I'm into to gaming, somewhat, so having a Mac for gaming is a bit redundant, given the fact that this doesn't need much to be able to game. Just a download and that is it, and having the big screen is very nice for both gaming and also watching my favorite shows on. The speakers are way nice on the tablet. I also love having a full size keyboard to type on. One other thing that I like is having the ability of having 2 apps side by side, and also having picture in picture mode on some of the video apps I have on my iPad pro so far. The battery lasts a long time, which is very nice for the \"tasks\" at hand. All in all, this tablet was worth it for me. Also I should mention that I purchased the apple pencil along with this beast of a tablet, as well as the apple keyboard for this machine, and I have to say, they both work very well."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0155KDJWA", "review": "So I have mine through T-Mobile so I can use it on the go and not be restricted by WiFi. I previously had the iPad Air 2 and loved that one so much it was light and perfect. I debated about the trade in and went for it so I will say if you own the Air 2 just stay with it unless you want to spend a ton because the Air 2 is awesome and I do miss it. This one is awesome as well in its own way as in this is a totally different beast. It does well at everything just as the Air 2 but it is massive and it is heavy and no you cannot just toss it in your purse and go like the Air 2. Now if you want to use it for graphic arts and in conjunction with the pencil then yes this is a good choice and absolutely kills it there. So I wanted to make sure I just put that out there for the people like me that are faced with do I swap from Air 2 I would say if you are not looking to do art and like convenience of toss and go NO.\n\nNow as for the actual product itself I have had no issues at all and it works wonderfully. It is bulky as I mentioned and I think I am hung up on that because I switched to Apple from being an avid Android user from the beginning but I was sick of the bulk of Samsung namely and the way they slow down so much after a couple months. So I got the Air 2 and the difference was amazing I have had the Samsung tablets well pretty much all of them and the Air 2 hands down was best. I love the light weight and sleek look Apple has on its products period. I love that they do not slow down etc. So now I am all Apple. So this is why the bulk bugs me I think and yes I knew it would be bulky but I did not factor in cases etc. But I still love this beast,even if at times I feel more like it is a laptop than a tablet. It is working great and I did go out and get the pencil so now I can experience the full thing. I am not an artist I just draw as a stress reliever and I have loved drawing since childhood and this gives me the opportunity to sit there like I have a whole tray of crayons,pencils,pens you name it and I do not need to stock up on sketch books either so I save all of that. I can just sit and draw and it feels like a real paper pencil experience. So that is pretty sweet though sometimes the glass seems a little slick with the pencil depending on the type of cover. It is very responsive and the 3D touch experience is great especially if you are doing shading or something similar. I have seen more and more apps come out for this pad and it also has no issues running any original ones though some are not yet made to fit the screen. I can watch movies in bed or in the car, I can do anything I would do with a laptop mostly to be honest all in this one device. As a matter of fact I did get rid of my laptop when I bought this. I have found many reasonably priced accessories for it here on Amazon and would have to say this is definitely a great device to have if it is in your budget and you want to have something to do art on and plan to get the pencil. I would have to say that if you want something for professional use and art or just something that is more than a tablet this is a must have and honestly once you go Apple......you never go back. Sorry Samsung...."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0155KDJWA", "review": "I have always owned a laptop and this was my first foray into an attempt at not owning one. I found myself using my phone for twitter and other social media and a laptop to consume media such as Netflix and for the ability to write papers. I did not need the processing power to do such lack-luster tasks so I looked into the iPad Pro.\n\nFirst off, this is a mobile device, running iOS. It functions the same as other iOS devices, but it has larger screen real-estate which drastically changes the abilities of said device. Still, it is an iPad, not a laptop computer! Arbitrary comparisons between a Surface Pro and an iPad Pro are flawed. They are very different and while the surface is a dedicated desktop opeating systems, the iPad is that of a mobile one. Now, don't let this dissuade you. I bought this iPad Pro in December and it has become my laptop. I do have access to a computer if it is truly needed, but I have only found myself using a computer once, maybe twice in the last 2 months and even in said instances, it was just easier to do so due to lack of mobile support.\n\nI can comfortably have Microsoft Word and Safari open side-by-side and use both efficiently. Picture in Picture support is great and you are able to play a video in a little box and place it in a corner of your screen (nearly all videos played in safari are supported and apps have the option to support it). I also own the Apple Pencil and it writes wonderfully and makes taking notes in classes that are writing heavy (math, foreign language, etc.) very convenient and organized.\n\nBasically, the iPad Pro shines as a tablet. It has the ability to perform lighter tasks of a computer (papers, Netflix, social media, etc.), but is not a full-fledged computer. If you must compare it to the surface (I indeed owned one), the Surface is a device that attempts to be both tablet and computer. While it is certainly a good device, I found myself disappointed with the tablet features and feeling limited to using in a computer-orientated fashion. The iPad Pro on the other hand, I have moved from using my phone to using my iPad for the likes of Twitter, Facebook, etc.; but alongside this, I can also easily take notes or write a paper."}

However, Apple is clearly trying ineffectually to compete with the Surface Pro market. While the Surface Pro offers full Office power, the iPad Pro is nothing more than an entertainment device. The Surface Pro comes with a pen, and the iPad Pro comes with nothing more than a charging cord.  If you want the \"pencil\" (Apple cannot even use accepted terminology) you will pay an additional $135 - seriously?\n\nFor that price you can get a Surface Pro that will be much more than an entertainment device - it will actually serve for your workplace. I have two Surface Pros, one for home and one for work.  I just purchased the iPad Pro for my wife yesterday at Costco, and was disappointed at what you get for your money - nothing more than entertainment.\n\nThose fools at Apple should be ashamed at themselves, but I know they are not.  They are laughing all the way to the bank - they are selling a unit that is little better than a smart phone at the same price that you can purchase a truly useful machine.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0155KDJWA", "review": "I've been using my iPad Pro since November with the Pencil and Smart Keyboard.  It does more things well than any other device.  It looks like an ultra-thin laptop and can do most of what a laptop can do.  It looks like a big iPad and can do everything iPads can do - in almost every way better because of the bigger screen and speakers.  And it can do most of what a pad of paper can do for notes and sketches with the Pencil.  Nothing else combines all those capabilities as well as this iPad.\n\nThe iPad Pro is the same size as a full sized pad of paper, which I stopped bringing to meetings now that I have this.  It's heavier, but I can still throw it under my arm if I need both hands, the way one might a pad of paper.\n\nThere is some debate about this being a 'laptop replacement'.  The attempt to find the right words to classify the iPad is an attempt to understand it.  For many, it could be a laptop replacement, a pad of paper replacement, a TV replacement, a magazine replacement, a textbook replacement, a smaller iPad replacement.  I definitely use the iPad in many situations I would have turned to a laptop, but I'm not giving up my laptop.  In no way does this make my love my iPad less.\n\nI love the the silicon covers Apple sells.  It makes the iPad Pro feel armored.  I can throw it in a backpack full of junk without worry.  I set it down without babying it like a laptop.  And the silicon is grippy which makes holding it easy.  Works great with the keyboard.  Painfully expensive for a case.  Difficult to imagine how a piece of rubbery plastic that expensive isn't a ripoff.  But I'd make the same purchase again - they are that good.\n\nNothing is perfect, but the iPad Pro is a giant step in that direction."}

They could still sell it stand alone for $100, but include it with the pro for no extra charge, but the pencils sell like hotcakes, so they're not going to change the business model.\n\nAnyways, back to the iPad. The screen is huge and the overall construction of the iPad Pro is super solid, which is typical of Apple but on a tablet of this size, you can really appreciate that Apple sturdiness. The display is the best I've seen on any phone or tablet displaying bright, sharp, and vibrant images that just seem more life like than ever before without any 3D utilization. Images just look amazing, but this was bought to be almost fully dedicated to artwork. Using this coupled with the Apple Pencil and some apps like Sketckbook Pro and Procreate, will grant you an amazing drawing and painting experience. Procreate's utilization of the Apple Pencil is by far some of the best I've seen for stylus's with pressure and tilt sensitivity. You will be amazed at the precise feedback of your inputs of attention to detail when working with the Apple pencil on this screen.\n\nAll in all, this is an amazing bargain for how you can draw with this tool. Before tablets of this caliber emerged a few years ago, you only had drawing tablets and had to be used with a laptop or desktop and those costed as much if not more than this iPad pro, and Wacom's own multipurpose tablet costs about $700 more than this. Digital art on the go is the future. I have my whole art studio in my backpack now and have the option to watch movies or game on the side."}

The apple tech was not helpful, wants me to pay $29.99 to send it back for repairs which will take 3+ weeks even though this thing is brand new and never worked. Apple should pay the shipping for expedited service, but the tech was rude and would not let me talk to a supervisor. DON'T BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP!"}

Got it?\n\nI have an iPad 4 and a Macbook Pro 15 and based on what I do with my iPad 4 and my Macbook Pro, I had no need for an iPad Pro. Definitely not a need for an iPad Pro with its keyboard.\n\nSo I decided to get the iPad Pro naked and to stick with it as a better iPad 4. Et voil. Am I happy? Mostly. When I don't have my Macbook Pro, it is good enough for note-taking and emails which in the end is 90% of what I do with a machine. But of course it is a bit unwieldy."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0155KDJWA", "review": "I highly recommend this product if you are going to use this as a note taking device.  That's really the only thing I can comment on because that's what I bought it for.  It's my digital notepad.  I use Evernote to store all my notes and I use various programs (GoodNotes, LiquidText) with it to mark up drawings, pictures, webpages, and documents.  I purchased the Apple Pencil as well and the handwriting is perfect.  Taking notes, especially handwritten notes, helps me retain information better and doing it on the iPad Pro makes it more enjoyable--which justifies the price for me.  Whatever gets me to want to learn more and be more productive in my career is worth a lot.  The multitasking feature that allows you to have 2 programs open side by side is a great feature that I use often.  I actually purchased the Surface Book first and returned it after 3 days.  It is not a bad device, I was very impressed with it's powerful features and that it allowed you to have a full blow Windows desktop on a tablet.  BUT, it was way too buggy and I really didn't need the power of a full blown Windows OS on a tablet.  For my use, the Surface Book actually made things more complicated.  I also found a program called SplashTop that allows me to access my Windows laptop EASILY and it works great.  If you do more with Windows and want to replace your Laptop, than the Surface Pro or Book is the way to go (if you can live the bugs).  If you need a great note taking device that is smooth, simple, and fast AND you are not trying to replace a Laptop---get the iPad Pro."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0155KDJWA", "review": "The iPad Pro is a pretty interesting new tablet. It's got a lot going for it, but plenty of opportunities as well. Definitely one of the best tablets Apple has ever made.\n\nSize/Weight\n---\nIt's pretty darn big. The screen is about as big as 2 regular iPad screens side by side. It reminds me of when the iPhone 6 Plus came out... At first it felt/looked comically large. But once you get used to it, there's no going back. That's how the iPad Pro feels. It does have a little heft to it, and that's one of my biggest complaints. It feels nicely balanced for how large it is, but wish it were lighter.\n\nSound\n---\nIt has 4 speakers and they sound great. It's really quite surprising and a giant leap over prior generations. Very immersive.\n\nScreen\n---\nOne of the top rated reviews here had me worried when it said that the screen is dim compared to other iPads. Maybe I'm not seeing something but I have an iPad Air 2 as well and the screen on both is fantastic. Really, nothing at all to complain about here.\n\nOne thing about it that I hadn't considered previously... I had brought the iPad Pro to my parents, who are getting up there in age, and they seemed much more receptive to using it because the screen was so large and they could see everything better compared to even the Air 2.\n\nSoftware\n---\nOne of the biggest selling points of the iPad Pro is that it can multitask and you can have 2 full size iPad apps open side by side. In reality this functionality feels very half baked and most apps don't even support it yet. For instance, I'm drafting this review in the Notes app. I can swipe from the right side of the screen to bring up Safari... But safari will sit on top of part of the notes app - they can't both be completely visible. Many apps don't support this at all yet.\n\nI'm a big believer in using iPads for real work, but when it comes down to it the multitasking, at least as of the writing of this review, is pretty useless.\n\nThe touch keyboard is pretty fabulous and feels surprisingly natural. It's near full size in landscape mode. I'm typing this review on the touch keyboard and it doesn't really feel bad at all. Prior generation iPads it felt cramped and not quite right, but this isn't bad at all and makes me not want to spend $170 on the smart keyboard since I don't type that much and this works well enough.\n\nOne thing that hadn't occurred to me when I got the iPad Pro was how great graphic novels and comics would look. I'd always been happy with them on my iPad Air 2, but even on that model many comics aren't able to be displayed full size. The screen of the iPad Pro is finally big enough to display stuff like this full size and it looks amazing.\n\nAccessories\n---\nThe Apple Pencil is pretty awesome. I'm not an artist but have been having a lot of fun with it. For someone like me it actually seems like a better experience drawing/painting/etc on the ipad because it's easier to play around and experiment, and there's no risk involved... if something looks terrible, just undo it. Back to the pencil though, I've tried other active styluses on tablets before but this is just in a class of its own. Really, very precise, hardly any lag, feels great overall. It's surprising to me how great it is. Only complaint is there's not really a good way to take it with you without fear of it breaking. It doesn't attach to the ipad, they don't make cases for it... seems like a miss. I found an apple pencil case on etsy that looks awesome, and I'm sure after it's been out longer there will be plenty of accessories.\n\nThe official smart keyboard is way too expensive ($170) and I'm not sure it's for me. I am not sure I like the idea of using a bunch of accessories to turn a tablet into a not-very-good-laptop anyway. If you want a laptop, get a laptop. It'll suit you better.\n\nThe official cases are absurd how expensive they are. To get a Smart Cover and silicone back for it will cost $140. Completely ridiculous. I bought a $15 origami case that completely covers the iPad and can stand it up in portrait or landscape modes and works pretty well. Surprised how many 3rd party cases are out there for the Pro.\n\nBattery\n---\nSeems about on par with the iPad Air 2 -- so it's excellent.\n\nPrice\n---\nI'm not sure how I feel about the price. On one hand, it feels expensive compared to the previous generation iPads... But on the other hand, it's a larger, premium device and costs the same as a modern unlocked iPhone so it doesn't seem too outrageous.\n\nConclusion\n---\nThere's a lot to like about it - once you go to the bigger screen you won't want to go back. The heavier weight, half-baked multitasking, and outrageously priced accessories don't really detract that much from how awesome it is overall. I don't know if I can call it the best iPad ever, the Air 2 should still be in consideration as well, but either way it's a fabulous tablet and one I highly recommend."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0155KDJWA", "review": "I know it is very expensive and it is not full replacement of a full os. However, when you buy this, you already know what you are looking for. In my opinion, the apple pencil gives me the best drawing experience ever on a digital surface.  It is extremely responsive and smooth. The feeling is insane. It throws all other tablets into the water by just this feature.  I would buy it simply because of the apple pencil.  If you are aiming for creativity with a drawing stylus, look no further. If you use it for a full laptop replacement, I would say go with a macbook air or macbook 12in, or macbook pro retina13.  Within a short of period time, I didn't see this gonna replace a laptop simply because the IOS is not ready yet. However, this can also be great option for you if you tend to use it just for typing and media consumption."}

I like my IPad smaller version that is easier to hold.  Even my larger IPad is almost too much and I don't use it as often.  I will save my Thousand Dollars Plus and not purchase this IPAD Pro."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0155KDJWA", "review": "Let me start by saying I have been an IPad fan for years. Every new release I've stayed up until midnight to be the first to purchase. I have an IPad, my wife has and IPad and both of my kids have IPads. So when I tell you that I don't care for Apple's latest IPad Pro, it's not because I'm anti Apple products.\nBottom line is the IPad pro is to big. I heard once that Steve Jobs was against larger IPads because he felt they were ergonomically incorrect. Well Steve was right. My Air2 felt perfect in my hands and fit easily the into any bag. The Pro does not. It feels even more conspicuous in public. Because of its size, it is not easy to handle and I've even found my left arm has developed muscle pain from tying to hold it like a previous IPad. I know that sound reticulous us but I'm telling ya...\nHowever the improvement in sound is unbelievable. The four improved speakers actually makes watching a movie plausible unlike previous IPads which required headphones to hear anything. That's the only positive I can give though. I know reports say the processor and graphics are twice as fast, but I don't notice any difference. The Air2 was already pretty fast.\nThe only way I can see the IPad Pro being justified is as a laptop, but even that falls short. Mostly because for $1,000 you can get a super computer of a laptop. The pro doesn't even come with a keyboard for that price.\nBottom line is the IPad Pro is no longer a mobile device. And if it's going to be a laptop type device, why not just get a laptop for less money and more performance. I will sell my IPad Pro to the first buyer and go back to the Air2 ASAP."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0155KDJWA", "review": "Beautiful. Huge screen. I also love the addition of the Logitech Keyboard that Apple sells with it. I've owned the iPad 1, 2, 3, and the mini Air. I still draw daily on the 3, though it is 4 years old now. I've been an artist on the iPhone and iPad since the iPhone 3. I started a 365 day challenge to draw on the iPhone 3. I mention this only because I'm asked this question a lot(especially by child artists who want to get started). People always ask where my Amazing Dragons came from. As that year went by, I progressed onto the iPad 1, then the iPad 3rd Gen. My dragons showed up around Day 300. So the iPad has changed my life as an artist and businessperson. Forever.\n\nMy plan with the iPad Pro is to use it solely for my art. Dedicated to that, using the iPad Pro Pen. I must add that I did try out a lot of the things I love on my 3rd Gen, like the apps I love: movies on HBONow, Showtime, Netflix, Lifetime movie club. It has the most beautiful display I've seen so far.\nNote: I did buy the Pro on Apple's site, and it arrived in just 5 days directly from China via FedEx. I just wanted artists to know what this machine can do for them. I have worked on the Wacom Intuos 4 and the Wacom Cintiq Companion with Photoshop CC 2015.\nBut, I find the iPad much easier to sketch with. There are a myriad of artist apps you can use, so I won't list any. It's a personal thing you've got to work out on your own.\nAs far as stylus, I have loved the Elago, Boxwave and now iPad Pro's Pen. The iPad Pro pen is AMAZING. So exact and easy to create artwork because it doesn't have a rubber tip like the older stylus's. It's really incredible to see what it can do.\nI was told by an Apple specialist that the iPad pro pen stylus is NOT backward compatible. Can't be used with older iPads. Good info to know. But my other stylus's are working great with the Pro.\nJust an artist's and movie lover's perspective. It's a rocking machine that I know will serve me at least 4 years like my 3rd Gen has (and still is). Great job, Apple!\nI've included a couple of drawings I've done with the iPad Pro, including my dragon dedication to Bowie after his death. The iPad Pro has really improved on the iPad's artistic possibilities."}

Not an Apple snob, my main computer's a Dell, but I lovvvvvvvvvvvvve ipads.\nIt's like living in the future when using one.\nI haven't bought a physical book in years (huuuge Kindle e-book library on my tablets that doesn't clutter my limited real world shelf space. I keep dust on my shelves, my books on my iPads :P )\n\nAnyhoo the iPad Pro is a bit of a splurge, butttt I love it.\nWe don't have a tv, or kids, or a game console or whatever so we got the iPad Pro :)\n\nI don't like that you can't use a mouse. Annoying. I hope that future apps will have a bluetooth mouse enabled, commme on Apple.\nIt has Air Print but it doesn't work with our Dell wifi printer. Another slight annoyance.\nSo I won't be using the iPad Pro as my deicated somputer, it's not there yet. Still have my desktop Dell for day to day stuffs.\n\nSize, I got it because it's hugggggge. I saw people complaining or griping a bit that it can be hard to hold, well duh, it's huuuuuuge. Just get a handle. I use a Gripzilla Pro, no problems, I hold it in one hand and can draw and type and play games with the other. Or if I am laying in bed I pop it in my Skycrane (works with the handle system) and watch vids, movies, play puzzle games (The Room 3 rocks! need more puzzzzzle games, any suggestions let me know I am looking for something new to play)\n\nI am waiting on my Apple pencil, like every one else, but have been having fun playing with a regular stylus in Procreate (that app is as awesome as every one says. I have been having fun and love all the potential of that program, like having an entire art studio in the iPad and I can assume from all the youtube vids of Apple Pencil reviews that it'll just be even better with the pencil :)\n\nLets see, the sound. WOW. I alllways (almost always) used my bluetooth speaker with my Air 2, because you couldn't hear proper;y if the AC came on or if you walked any distance away. I was pretty pleased when I realized I can walk around the house a bit and hear really well. Like we literally play a Jim Butcher audio book and walk around the house (getting our steps in, you know how it is) and listen and I can hear almost all over the house. LOUD speakers.\n\nNice and bright screen, bright enough that for most of the day I have it half brightness and so my battery lasts really well.\nI lower it even more at night before sleep.\n\nLet's see, the camera is awesome, kind of the same as the Air2 so not a step down so I am happy. I actually use my iPad camera a LOT. Like, a lot. I have family that live in Canada and I'm in Arizona and I don't see them for ages and ages in person so I am a big photo taker to share on facebook with them. And it's so convenient and quick to be on facebook, with the app, take a random cat picture, dinner photo, whiskey soda photo and share with my Mom etc. Yeah, I'm that lady. Wanna see what we had for breakfast? TOO bad I posted it already ;)\n\nI'd say if you are hoping to replace your computer completely you might want to hold off.\nIf you are looking for a glorious, gorgeous super awesome large screen gaming/reading/socialmedia-ing/movie-ing/email-checking/facebooking device with awesome speakers, storage, camera etc, then go for it. Treat yourself :)\n\nI almost forgot I am a wordy type of chatty person and write a lot, so the huge screen provides a pretty magnificent full size keyboard (almost) experience but I also pair up my bluet tooth keyboard and away I go. Super nice.\n\nOh p.s. I bought my iPad Pro from the Apple store because I was near one, but I like reviewing stuff on Amazon."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0155KDJWA", "review": "There is so much talk about the declining sales of iPad. So much so, the discussion might influence a potential buyer to pause before buying or not buy at all, and instead buy a competing tablet or laptop. I think the key to making a decision to buy the iPad Pro lies in a wallpaper Apple provided with the very first version of iPad. It was a licensed photograph of Pyramid Lake by Robert Misrach. The exposure, made at night, appears to be in daylight. The clue that it was a night time photograph are the star trails that resulted from the long exposure. The lake surface appears as smooth as a mirror. The mirror surface of the lake in this photograph enables the viewer to immerse himself or herself in the device, making it a perfect fulfillment of whatever there desires might be \"for iPad\". The iPad is a perfect \"evocative object\", evoking whatever feelings and intentions the iPad user brings to it. That is why the iPad is so undefinable and uncategorizable. It is is whatever ever we want it to be.....and with iPad Pro Apple reaches again for that elusive quality.\n\nAfter 7 days with the new Apple iPad Pro I am happy that I followed my hunch that the iPad Pro would be better for me than a laptop for a mobile multi-purpose device. I am very pleased how the slide over multitasking works. Bigger is better whether using multi-tasking features live slide over and picture-in-picture. The user does not get poorly sized Windows for both applications. For example if your browser is open in one window, and photos is open in a second, but applications are scaled to size in each window.\n\nI purchased the 32MB version because I tend to use iCloud to store photos, music, documents. I only need local storage for IOS apps and the few documents I need.\n\nI purchased a black rear cover, and a contrasting white front cover. The only accessory I use so far is the Apple Pencil for drawing in Paper by 53 and Apple Notes ( to take notes in my University classes ). I use the iPad Pro almost exclusively landscape or horizontal, the only iPad that can be used in portrait is the Mini.  At the time I purchased the iPad Pro the wait times for shipment of the Apple Pencil was 4-5 weeks. However, I was able to find one locally at my University Bookstore. I am concentrating on using the Apple Pencil at the moment, using just the on-screen keyboard. I have an open mind about buying the iPad Pro keyboard in the future. However, the iPad is all about creating art through use of touch and the pencil right now. I don't want it to be a laptop. I want it to be a \"blank sheet of paper\".\n\nThe audio produced by the 4 speakers produce a very pleasing music listening experience without headphones.\n\nOne final note: it appears the iPad Pro includes technology that can be used in the future today's blog post in Daring Fireball notes that the Lightning connector includes support for USB 3.0, a much faster transfer speeds. It will be interesting to see what applications take advantage of that speed next year."}

Lots of good comments in other reviews, so here are some thoughts from a photographer and publisher.\n\nLove the size and screen. I am 6'2\", so it does not seem too large or unwieldy. It does for my wife who is a small framed 5'4\".\n\nThe unit will not replace a laptop for serious photographers, designers, or publishers. iOS is currently unable to process RAW images, so you are left editing imbedded jpg or png files with Adobe products. Too bad: Surface Pro much more powerful, but no apps for it.\n\nI have found the split screen a big improvement, but a bit clunky if you are used to Windows. A lot of programs (including Apple productivity software) do not yet have this enabled. Microsoft Office is. Split screens are limited to two choices in landscape, two in portrait.\n\nIt makes a great second screen, and I have started experimenting using it as a replacement for my Wacom tablet. Pen works very well, and is a must have for serious photographers and designers.\n\nOverall a good product, but some pretty major limitations. Looking forward to continued software improvements."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0155KDJWA", "review": "Update:  Now at the five month mark.  I use this all day, every day, for many things.  The things I like compared to my older iPad are the speed and improved sound quality, both of which are significant.  I have had ZERO problems with this unit.  It is paired with a Logitech Create keyboard which has performed perfectly also.  I should note that one of the reasons I purchased this is that I'm getting on in years and appreciate being able to read without searching for my glasses.  This is an item which, if it were lost, I'd go right back out and buy another one.\n\nUpdate:  I've now been using the iPad Pro for almost a month, and here's an observation.  The battery life seems to have improved significantly during this time period.  I've read somewhere online that it requires a \"break-in period,\" I can't say for sure this has happened, but I can state that I'm getting much longer usage from a charge than I did originally, when it was draining pretty fast compared with my other iPads.  What I like most about this new iPad is its speed, very fast, it's a good purchase.\n\nI've been using my iPad Pro now for three weeks and will offer my initial impressions.  First, let me say I did not buy this to replace or imitate a laptop, I am retired and simply wanted a larger iPad to help with dimming eyes and a propensity to always be losing my reading glasses.  This is perfect for me.  I've owned three prior iPads, the last being the iPad Air, first edition.  Here are the things I like:\n\nThis baby's fast, more so than even my MAC.\nThe screen is beautiful, colors are bright and images detailed.\nI have not noticed any difference in the charge or discharge rate on this model, even when it's pretty well depleted it charges to 100% overnight.\nIndeed, it is thin and lightweight, but this won't make much difference since for practical purposes this will need to be used in a case.  It is too big and slippery to be handheld.\n\nI cannot comment on the Pencil because I have no need for it and it's apparently late to market anyway.  I can comment on the iPad Pro keyboard, which I tried in the Apple store and hated, as do most reviewers.  My Pro is in a Logitech Create case, which is sturdy and encloses the entire iPad, you can find my review elsewhere on Amazon.\n\nTo summarize, I don't use this for an \"enterprise\" purpose, I read newspapers, watch videos and do general browsing.  I'm an ancient senior who wanted something which was easy to read and operate.  It's perfect for me.\n\nNote on the photo:  The iPad Pro is shown in a red Logitech Create case, which compliments the gold Pro case perfectly."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0155KDJWA", "review": "I'm not sure if this is a laptop replacement. If I had a $1000 budget and had to choose, I'd probably choose a MacBook Air (or laptop of your choice). For obvious reasons, using a laptop is like riding a bike. It's second nature. Ask me that question in 2 years, and I might give a different answer.\n\nI cannot put the iPad Pro down. I have used my MacBook Pro less and less each day. The Apple Pencil is so much fun to use. Honestly, the iPad Pro in general is so much fun to use. These factors lead me to believe that Apple is really on to something. If the iPad Pro is not a laptop replacement right now, it's only a matter of time. As far as speed/power is concerned, the iPad Pro is a fast (if not, faster) as any laptop or computer I've ever used. In strictly tablet terms, it's by far the best tablet on the market.\n\nHowever, if Apple truly wants the iPad Pro to replace your laptop, adjustments to the operating system must be made. I am in favor of a file system, and I'd love mouse/trackpad support. Only then would I be truly willing to give up on owning a laptop.\n\nI recommend that Apple ditches iOS on iPad Pro completely. The same way that Apple TV has its own OS (tvOS) and Apple Watch has its own OS (watchOS), Apple should make iPadOS, designed specifically for iPad Pro. Something that more closely resembles a desktop OS. iOS is perfect for iPhones and iPad minis. It is good, not perfect, for iPad Pro.\n\nWith that said, I do highly recommend this product. Apple is always tinkering with their products. Once you get your hands on an iPad Pro, only then will you realize that it's only scratching the surface of what it can do. I think a year from now, the \"laptop replacement\" debate will really ramp up. For now, I think it's an amazing device in its own right, and a remarkable companion device to those who own a laptop/desktop.\n\nI attached 2 pictures, one of which is a drawing I made in Adobe Sketch using strictly the Apple Pencil.\n\nUPDATE\nI've had my iPad pro now for 2 months. It has essentially replaced my laptop. I take my iPad pro everywhere. I take it work everyday. Just got back from a trip to FL, the speakers on the iPad pro are so good, it makes a perfect little jukebox by the pool. Takes great pictures outdoors, indoors it's average. But I love this thing."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0155KDJWA", "review": "Sorry people, the iPad Pro is not meant to replace your laptop it is not meant to replace your MacBook. The iPad Pro is just a more productive iPad. Apple does not want to make a device that will replace their popular selling MacBook. So who is it for? It is for those people who have enjoyed using the iPad and yet do not necessarily need the productivity of a laptop. For example, I have seen people use iPads in college to do their homework. Not to mention that Apple does have the basic Microsoft Office apps in their App Store. Now I saw the review and the release of this product on YouTube by Apple, and it seems that this product is meant to compete with Samsung's Galaxy Note pro 12.2 inch tablet. The only problem I see with purchasing this device is, it is priced similarly to products that it cannot compete with in productivity. For example, the surface pro. Had it been priced similarly to the things that it can compete with like the Samsung tablet I mentioned earlier, then maybe it would be worth the purchase. But lucky for Apple that they have a lot of Apple fanboys, because otherwise you'd have to be crazy to spend on a tablet, what you would normally spend on a laptop or a macbook. Had it been priced somewhere around 600 or 500 or maybe even $700 for the 32 gigabyte version, then maybe the potential would be there. It's funny, Because they gave it the screen size of a laptop, the speed and power of a laptop, the screen resolution of a laptop, the PRICE of a laptop, but not the PRODUCTIVITY of a laptop."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0155KDJWA", "review": "Granted, the iPad Pro has a larger screen size and a faster processor which had it been a first generation device, would have been the rave of the 12 inch tablet market which I think stretches the limit of tablet usability.\n\nFor all of its size, screen resolution and faster processor, Apple seems to have missed the all encompassing reason why users want the larger format tablet.  For instead of tailoring the iPad Pro to have apps running with more scree real estate, they have instead, simply given us a device that might satisfy the presbyopic user rather than give us a device that enables a higher resolution app.  Case in point .... The number of rows and columns of icons on the iPad Pro, is no different than that of the iPad Air 2 and its predecessors or the iPad Minis.  The same despite the fact that there os enough screen real estate to comfortable have a 5 x 6 matric of icons as opposd to 4 x 5.\n\nThe same is true of the apps themselves.  They are simply a magnified version of what younsee on iPad Airs and Minis.  So my question would then be, \"Why bother?\"  And to this end, i believe that Apple has failed to produce anything but a bigger iPad.  It remains to be seen if developers willor are able to address the larger screen areas.  I for one had hoped to have more drawing space.\n\nSo for now, i would caution users to check it out first befor jumping to the iPas Pro.  In most cases for the current user interfaces, an iPad Air 1/2 is plenty big enough.  Of course i will change my mind if the Pro starts ustilizing the increased screen size.\n\nI think that Stephen Jobs would more or less agree with this assessment and had he been around, the iPad Pro would have started the push toward more screen utilizing apps."}

If you forgot to recharge this thing while you're on the road then you're totally screwed. Be prepare to spend half a day without it. To make matters worst the iPad Pro is a total joke as a laptop replacement device in comparison to Surface Pro or the Macbook Air. Post PC device my @ss Apple.\n\nOn the bright side, the giant screen and awesome stereo sound is a game changer making this the ultimate app and streaming content tablet. It's a totally new tablet experience, like I'm discovering the iPad for the very first time. If you have kids, be warned. The only way to get your iPad Pro back is to pry it out of their cold dead hands."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0155KDJWA", "review": " DISPLAY / SIZE\n\nThe displays in both the tablets are equally stunning: the iPad Pro being slightly larger of the two, with a 12.9-inch screen in comparison to the Surface Pro's 12.3 inches.\nTheyve similar resolutions, the iPad Pro at 2,732 x 2,048 (4:3 aspect ratio) and the Surface Pro 4 at 2,736 x 1,824 (3:2 aspect ratio), with the pixel density slightly higher for the SP4 at 267 pixels per inch compared to 264 for the iPad Pro. In the weight department, the SP4 is slightly heavier at 1.73 pounds compared to 1.57 pounds of the iPad Pro.\n\n POWER / PERFORMANCE\n\nProcessor-wise, the iPad Pro runs Apple's latest A9X chipset, while the Surface Pro has a range of sixth-generation (Skylake) Intel Core i3, i5, and i7 processors, with configuration options from 4GB to 16GB of RAM\n\niPad Pro easily outpaces the Pro 4's entry-level m3 CPU, but thats probably where it ends. When it gets to the Surface Pro 4's i5 / i7 line-up, iPad Pro lags behind in delivering the same kind of performance.\n\n THE SOFTWARE\n\nThis is the real differentiator between the two devices. The Surface Pro 4 runs a full desktop OS, the Windows 10, while the iPad Pro, in fact runs its mobile OS - the iOS 9, the same OS that powers its iPhones and iPads.\n\nThis will have a great impact on the kind of tasks you deploy on each of these devices. The Surface Pro 4 is clearly in the league of laptops, while the iPad Pro just isn't.\n\n CONNECTIVITY\n\nConnectivity is a huge plus for the Surface Pro as the device includes a full-sized USB 3.0 port in addition to a microSD card slot and a mini DisplayPort output. While all that the iPad Pro has is just one Lightning connector, meaning you would heavily need to rely on USB hubs and HDMI/VGA Adapters to hook onto that ONE SINGLE POTRT to get your job done.\n\n ACCESSORIES\n\nBoth the devices require keyboards to be purchased separately.\n\nThe Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Type Cover features physical backlit keys that are 19mm apart for a real keyboard layout, and a 40 per cent larger glass trackpad than previous iterations of the SP4.\n\nApple's Smart Keyboard acts as a case and stand, but it doesnt come near the plethora of positions / inclinations that the SP4 kickstand can assume. Additionally, iPad Pro Smart keyboard isn't backlit like Microsoft's and has no trackpad. But yes, apples huge partner ecosystem can contribute a lot here to fill in the gap left behind.\n\nAnother advantage for the SP4, is that there is FREE stylus included, while for iPad Pro thats another 99 USD to be shelled out.\n\n BATTERY\n\nThe iPad Pro has a 10,307 mAh battery, which is almost twice the size of the SP4 battery at 5,087 mAh. The iPad Pro is clearly the winner in the battery life department with its claimed 10 hours of mixed usage over the SP4s 9 hours. Currently, there are multiple issues reported by the users of the SP4 experiencing WAY lesser battery life than whats claimed by Microsoft, which is probably another bug waiting for a Microsoft fix.\n\n So there you go, either devices has its \"Wow.!!\" and \"Meh.!!\" moments.. So, the decision is ALL YOURS depending on your use-case and requirements   ..!!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0155KDJWA", "review": "I was quite surprised how much criticism was out there after the iPad Pro got out, and while in the beginning being skeptical about this thing myself I feel that after a few days of playing with this device I am ready to stand up for it. These are my observations:\n\n1) I do not see it as a laptop replacement and it is OK. Tablets provide a completely different environment than laptops. As someone called it - more \"intimate\". Yes, less productive, but more \"natural\" I would say. I got into iPads since the first one and I appreciate iPad Pro as a super tablet, not as a wannabe laptop replacement.\n\n2) The price. OK, Apple will squeeze you dry if you want one of its shiny toys. That's the way it is, especially if you an early adopter. In fact, compared to other iPads the Pro seems to be priced just fine, but of course you'll be paying the early adopter fee if you buy it now. If you think it is too expensive, wait for a year or two, buy it used or refurbished. About a month ago I finally got a used iPad Mini 2 because as much as I like iPad Mini 4 I think it is way too expensive as an addition to my iPad Air, and much less value than iPad Air 2.\nSome reviewers would start listing all those nice laptops one could get for the money that iPad Pro costs. Why stop there? Following this kind of logic, one could start complaining how expensive those laptops are compared to desktops.\n\n3) The size and weight. When holding the Pro and the Air in each hand I find the Air surprisingly heavy (well, part of it is that my Air has the Moshi cover which adds some weight, but it's one of the lightest covers out there). Clearly, the Pro is way more bulky, but well - there is no other way to get a larger screen unless they start projecting images in the air as holograms. But I am telling you - being able to see the entire A4 size page in a portrait mode without squinting is amazing. No way to get this with a laptop. In fact, the screen somehow feels bigger than my MBPr 15 inch display, probably because I typically hold the iPad closer to my eyes than the laptop. But to be honest, MBPr screen has more contrast the the iPad Pro.\n\n4) Speakers are awesome. I can get rid of my external speakers if I replace my iPad air with this thing in the kitchen.\n\nI did not try the keyboard and I don't think I care for it. As I said, I do not consider it to be a laptop replacement. If I am going to keep it it will replace my iPad Air: the Pro for home use, the iPad Mini 2 to take with me when I go outside of the house. I am still not quite sure whether I'll keep it or return and wait for another year to get more value out of this thing. I have not tried the Apple Pencil yet, and I suspect that it might be the deal breaker that will make me keep the iPad Pro and swallow the early adopter fee. Heck, we only live once, why not to enjoy our gadgets at their fullest! :)"}

It's certainly an iPad, but it's something no earlier iPad has been able to be.\n\nIt's a new kind of computer: it's iOS as a kind of desktop experience, one that makes the strongest case ever for the virtues of computing with one app at a time, and one that can make you more productive by affording you a much greater sense of clarity and focus. It declutters your space: mentally and physically. You have nothing in front of you but a keyboard and screen (closer to you than the screen on a laptop), and you're free from the busyness of juggling so many windows around a virtual desktop.\n\nPut another way: it may be less functional than a Mac or Surface Pro *if your primary goal is to multi-task*, but if your goal is to get discrete things done -- create a doc in Word, write email, read a webpage or a pdf -- the iPad Pro is so much more elegant, cleaner, and more pleasant to work with.\n\nApple seems to be saying: keep your laptop for the more elaborate file manipulation stuff. But for the vast majority of the rest of it, set your laptop aside and enjoy the clarity and elegance of this.\n\nI've had the benefit of using the Surface Pro 4 for the past two weeks and the iPad Pro for the past week. They're both incredible devices. The use cases for the SP4 are obvious, and I love using it (work paid for it, so I didn't have to choose). But if you love the design qualities of the iPad and iOS, you will find the iPP every bit as compelling to use for almost anything.\n\nAfter all the carping online about the limited keyboard shortcuts in iOS (which will obviously change soon), the complaints about how often you need to raise your arm to touch the screen, the limits of multi-tasking on the iPad, and so on, I've been pleasantly surprised by how much I can do on it (or how little I can't) and how easily. Many tasks I wouldn't have bothered with on my smaller iPads are now worth the time on the larger one, because it's so much nicer to use at this size.\n\nThe iPad Pro is also noticeably larger than the Surface Pro 4. Because I use the iPP with the Magic (and not Smart) Keyboard, I prop up on a few books, making it more ergonomic. It's like a large laptop screen at the right height, and closer than I could bring a laptop, making it more intimate and immersive. I could do the same with the SP4, but I usually use it with the Type Cover, which means it's usually lower down, with its screen seeming smaller and slightly more cramped by comparison.\n\nIs the iPP worth it if you can't do to much multi-tasking on it? Why would you buy it (plus accessories) when you could get a retina Macbook for almost the same price? This is the part that won't be obvious if you only try it out at the store.\n\nBuy it. Bring it home. Give it a try. It won't come down to specs. It will defy your earlier assumptions about computers and iPads. It will either appeal or it won't.\n\nI suspect it will. Either way, you'll see that there's really nothing else like it."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0155KDJWA", "review": "(This is an edit of the 128GB edition's review. The only difference between the two versions is the storage capacity. 32GB holds approximately 7000 music tracks (128-Kbps AAC encoding), 40 hours video or 40,000 pictures. Keep in mind that not all of that space is available for media storage, since iOS takes up about 2GB, and apps further take up valuable storage. In other words, with the 32GB variant, endeavor to go easy on those steamy videos downloaded online. Consider that the average 2 hour HD movie is 4GB. But a game of Tetris or Angry Birds is par for the course).\n\nThe eagle has landed, and it is sporting new feathers. I have embraced the Android platform for my phones, and will not be dissuaded from my PC in favor of a Mac. But my research in past years has convinced me that the best MP3 player is the iPod, just as the best tablet for the money is the iPad. I pride myself on being loyal to no brand, and have faithlessly - like a jocular mercenary - considered other tablets over the years: the Samsung Tab (too large) Sony Xperia Z (lackluster battery) Microsofts Surface (too large, WIFI only,  stunted app ecosystem) and the Blackberry Playbook (abysmal app ecosystem, could not print, obsolete). I have owned 3 iPads thus far, the last being the iPad Air (32GB variant). Since I did not upgrade my phone this year, I feel entirely justified in upgrading my \"antiquated\" 2-year old tablet. I purchased the space grey iPad Pro from (an electronics store), if only because I may return it (15% restocking fee notwithstanding). Do I still believe that the iPad is the best tablet on the market? Read on.\n\nObjectively: The ghost of Jobs frowns, even as Atlas shrugged. The most apparent feature of the iPad Pro is its sheer size. This incarnation - like a Gremlin fed after midnight - has grown to nearly 13-inches diagonally; an instant contradiction of Steve Jobs' assertion that 9 inches was the sweet spot for tablets, dimensionally. For all that, the Pro is quite thin at 6.9mm, and very light at 1.59 pounds. The front camera is at 1.2 megapixels, whereas the back camera is at 8 megapixels. There are now perforations at all 4 corners of the tablet, indicative of quadruple speakers that emit surprisingly loud and resonant volumes, even if bass remains a bit lacking. Perhaps a collaboration with Bose for future iterations? Surely in the \"yeah right\" category. A new port sticks out of the side of the Pro to which accessories can be connected, including a keyboard. There is still no USB port anywhere in sight. It comes in 3 colors: space grey, gold and silver. It would have been nice to have bordeaux (snotty French for burgundy) or navy as well, but pigs will fly before those options are made available. Err, did I mention that this thing is massive?\n\nImpressions: Apps fly with the Pros A9X; an incremental upgrade from the iPad Air 2s A8X processor. Screen portrayals are incredibly svelte, as is not surprising for its touted 2,732 x 2,048 pixels. It really does look like I am carrying a large slice of my HDTV. Thus far, I was able to get about 9.5 hours of battery life, between reading, watching videos and playing games. Multitasking has always been the Achilles heel of tablets, and the Pros Split View enables juxtaposing two apps on the screen at the same time in portrait mode. This is truly the greatest distinguishing feature on the Pro. It works, and works well. And the sheer size of the screen real estate helps with the multitasking. iOS 9 has been upgraded to iOS 9.1 to include support for the new stylus designed specifically by Apple for use with the Pro, called the Apple Pencil. I demoed the Pencil which was unavailable at the time of purchase. It is very responsive and sensitive enough to be responsive to pressure; a graphics designers dream. It can be charged in the iPad itself, using its lightning dock, and can be fully charged in about 35 minutes according to the salesperson. It connects via Bluetooth.\n\nAnnoyances: The iPad Pro is replete with fresh gripes. The Apple Pencil does not come with the already-very-expensive iPad Pro, even though the pen was one of its most hyped features. It costs an extra $100. The keypad, another indispensable item, also must be purchased separately. For a whopping $169.99. There is no expandable slot, and Apple has  at least as of now  eliminated a 16 GB or 64 GB variant. The options are between a 32 GB model and a 128 GB model. Which is akin to Ford Motor Company offering only two car models to potential customers: an unassuming Escort or a speedy Mustang, with nothing in between.  For those who need an iPad Pro with a data plan - like yours truly - the options are even more limited; only the 128 GB variant comes with an optional data plan, for now. Update 11-23-15: I woke up to find my iPad which I was charging overnight completely unresponsive. Then the screen went pitch black. C'est une catastrophe (as my erswhile Belgian French teacher back in college would say in her lilting accent, hallowed be her name). A quick online search found that I am not the only user experiencing the issue. Per Apple: \"To get back to using your iPad Pro, force restart it by pressing and holding both the Sleep/Wake and Home buttons for at least ten seconds, until you see the Apple logo. Apple is aware of this issue and is investigating.\" This is one of the reasons I usually desist from being the first to try out an electronic device. Just a natural aversion to being a guinea pig.\n\nIn operation: The Pro largely toes the line of its predecessors. Placement of the two volume buttons, lightning connector port and TouchID button which is dead center and to the bottom, is the same. The same matte greyish metal back with a glossy front surrounding the viewing panel is in evidence. Freshly minted though, is the tripartite cluster of small metal dots in a single line that represent the new Smart Connector on the iPad's left side. The device ships with a lightning connector and a charging base. One good thing about the Smart Keyboard is that it draws its power through the Smart Connector, and therefore does not require charging separately. This could also be a bad thing, as the iPad Pro's battery is apt to be depleted quicker with a keyboard - indeed any accessory - attached to the Smart Connector. With 4GB of Ram, the device fairly zips through most activities. Some apps have not been optimized for the Pro, though I have no doubt that they will be in time. Impressively, the audio component - i.e. speakers - readjust themselves depending on how the device is being held. Draw a finger from the right side of the tablet towards the middle, and a narrow rectangular screen pops out. Draw a finger down the top of the rectangle, and one can scroll through apps that are available for use side by side with whatever app is already open. Select an app, and draw it towards the middle, and one can view two apps on equal halves of the screen. The user can fully interact with both apps. Something that my iPad Air is unable to do despite the latest update.\n\nConclusion: This new iPad is a Jack of all trades, and master of none. Like an amphibian, it straddles two worlds without besting either. With its massive 13-inch screen, it is a past master at media consumption and multitasking. Simultaneously, it marginalizes the feature that I prize the most in a tablet: portability and convenience. I could not comfortably hold it for long periods to read books in my Kindle app as I have been accustomed to doing. Ironically my laptop; a Lenovo ThinkPad X240 at 12.5 inches has a slightly smaller screen than the Pro, yet the dedicated clamshell laptop is infinitely more comfortable to type with. The Pro's massive, gorgeous screen commands attention, and its new speakers are a joy. But the changes are not so compelling as to greatly distinguish it from last year's model. At $1,079.99 for the WIFI + Cellular 128 GB iPad, $949 for the 128 GB WIFI only and $799 for the 32 GB, it is more expensive than many laptops, and yet lacks the mobility that should have made it easier to carry. It does feel like Apple has lost its way with the loss of its dynamic founder. He notoriously abhorred the use of a stylus as an input device, and posited that 9 inches was the ideal size for a tablet, even as he poked fun at Blackberry's Playbook and Samsung's Tab. And I agreed; for those like myself who want one tablet to rule them all, the ideal size is between 7 inches and 9 inches. This iPad Pro seems to have cloned a Microsoft Surface - pen, size and even the name \"Pro\" - and stamped it with a half-eaten apple. I am decidedly on the fence, mainly because of its size, and will update this in coming weeks if I decide to go a different route for my tablet needs. While I am still convinced that the iPad is the best tablet on the market, the gap has definitely been narrowed.\n\nUpdate: Using the iPad in a sitting position in my living room or dinning room media consumption reigns supreme. Watching movies is a really immersive experience. But in my bedroom? I typically read in bed till my eyes grow weary before going to sleep. Ocasionally I'll watch a movie on Netflix or HBOGO while in bed. This iPad is so unwieldy that I have to prop it up on my chest for longer periods of watching movies or reading in bed. The bold size of this iPad definitely poses an inconvenience in such situations. I would have been interested in an \"iPad Air 3\" which maintains the same dimensions as last year's model. But I suppose that's the whole point; other than the size and processor, there isn't much of a transformation from last year's iteration. Particularly where the iPad Air 2 has the same multitasking abilities, albeit on a smaller sreen. I am considering the iPad Air 2, or the Mini now."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0155KDJWA", "review": "THIS is the iPad I had been waiting for all along. I have had the iPad 2, iPad 3, iPad Air 2, and this one beats them all as it is faster and has the right screen size for my work. I have had it now for 11 days and here's what I think:\n\nIs it a laptop replacement for me? NO.\nI have a Lenovo Yoga Pro 3 that is almost as slim, has a touchscreen that turns into a tablet by folding over and is fast and has a 500GB SSD as I run many software programs like Tableau, Adobe Photoshop and other analytics software and need a full featured laptop.\n\nSo why did I buy this expensive iPad Pro? (Gold, 128 GB WiFi)\nIt is FAST. The A9X chip makes it blazing fast with quick uploads and downloads. The iPad 3 had slowed to a crawl.\n\nIt is still light, just similar to the pre-Air models, just a little bigger. In bed, where I use it a lot I have to prop it on a pillow and that's more comfortable as I like to lie on my side and read or watch a movie. When sitting down on the couch I simply hold it and rest it against the couch arm. In a cafe, I keep it in the case and read it resting on a table. It's a little big and gets heavy if you're holding it one hand and don't support it on something, but the size is what I like.\n\nHere's what I mainly use it for:\n- Reading Books, Magazines, Newspapers, blogs, Research reports and web browsing:\nI love reading digital magazines, paper issues are so passe and clutter up my home. Whether it's Vogue, Wired, Business Week or a research report. This iPad screen (inside the bezel) is exactly the size of a print Vogue or Wired. Was that coincidental? Maybe not! New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal look and read fabulously on this beautiful and crisp screen. Models looks impossibly beautiful in Vogue, ready to leap off the pages. (See pics shot of the iPad Pro screen with Vogue magazine in a dark bedroom in this review)\n\nBooks are a pleasure to read, especially if you read cookbooks, art books and others that need a large color format. Textbooks are gorgeous on this iPad and you actually want to read them!\n\nResearch reports from eMarketer and PDFs from Forrester, read well. I can zoom into graphs and charts, and read everything on one page without having to slide from side to side as with the older iPads. My favorite blogs and other webpages are easy to read too without sliding over or zooming in all the time. I can see a FULL webpage at one time just like on my computer screen. This is a huge plus.\nThe ability to switch between apps and see one in a side panel is also nice as I can have something like wikipedia, email or notes running on the side while I do some other work on the main panel and refer back and forth.\n\nWatching movies and shows:\n\nWow! That's what I said when I heard the speakers the first time. Up until now I had to use accompanying products to listen to sounds during a movie, either a headphone or for watching with someone else, a Bose Sound dock. Now I can watch the movie with the native sound, the speakers are really nice. I can of course, keep using my favorite bluetooth headphones too. The screen is amazing, it's light enough to prop up and hold on a pillow next to me and watch while lying on my side. I am closer to my movies and shows and it's a different immersive experience with no distractions unlike TV watching. It has made me go to bed earlier in the night as it's so nice to use in bed.\n\nVideos can also play in screen like PIP from those older TVs. It's a nice feature if you like keeping a tab on some sports action or for video conferences.\n\nArt:\nI love looking at paintings in detail, so art books and books about painting, drawing and other art are excellent on this size. I can zoom in to see the colors unlike a paper book. I can even put a tracing paper or parchment on the screen and create my own interpretation of a picture or painting.\n\nI haven't received the pencil yet as it's still on backorder and no store has it in stock. I do \"zendoodling\" and drawing, so it would be fun to see if the pencil responds well and create more digital art. I agree that physical mediums are more tactile, but the speed at which I can draw and duplicate patterns or parts of paintings or edit them digitally offers me more creativity and freedom. I could not explore this fully in a smaller sized iPad. Some apps like Paper 53 still need to fully utilize the iPad Pro features, but it's getting there. It's more possible now to create digital art than ever before. I will report back when I have received the pencil as I ordered it as soon as it went on sale.\n\nSplit Screen feature: The split screen is amazing if I am looking at a picture and copying it onto a paper on the side. Previously, I had to use my phone and iPad to do this and then the phone screen was too small. The split screen is handy, and very intuitive. It DOES NOT work for all the apps yet, but hopefully the apps that need it will make the upgrade soon.\n\nIs I Pad Pro a good buy for you?\nI have more invested in the Apple iOS eco-system, so I did not really consider the Surface Pro 4. After trying the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 I was more frustrated that pleased so I won't even consider the View.  Surface Pro though, I am sure, is a better laptop replacement from what I've read, but I am not about to give up my laptop soon anyway. So for me Apple iPad Pro made sense.\n\nIf you have an older iPad you can think about an upgrade just because of the speed and multi-tasking available in this one. If you have an iPad Air or Air 2, go try it in the store and see if you really need the larger size. The split screen and multi-tasking is nice but not life changing and you may not need the larger size. I wanted the bigger size ever since I got the first iPad, so it made sense to spend that cash.\n\nIn the end I bought this beauty for myself as I'd rather have a gold iPad Pro than anything else this holiday, even diamond earrings, as it makes my life so much more productive than a diamond could!"}

They are the iPad 2, the iPad3, the iPad Air, iPad Air 2 and now the iPad Pro. We use the tablets about 8 hours per day for photography editing, video taking and editing and working on the internet. I am extremely familiar with the products and we own a total of 18 tablets using Apple, HP and Android technologies.  I read books every day.  I also get over 100 emails a day and I spend a lot of time reading news on the internet.\n\nI got my iPad Pro from Verizon as they offered me the WIFI + Cellular unit $100 less than it was being sold for on the Apple website. In addition I had $400 of rebate coupons for Verizon so I saved $505 when I purchased the iPad.\n\nIn my attached video I have tried to do a comparison between several of the product generations and the overall performance. Physically the iPad Pro is massive. When you unbox it you will be shocked at the size.\n\n* The iPad Pro is heavier and so much larger it seems awkward to hold. It weighs 1.59 pounds for the cellular version compared to .98 pounds for the iPad Air 2.\n* The Retina display is better as it is thinner and the colors and clarity is much better to my eyes. The parallax side views are clearer and the colors are deeper and more realistic. It still has 264 pixels per inch and it is an excellent video device.  The screen has 2732 by 2048 pixels and as a display it is amazing. It is like holding a flat screen HD TV in your hand.\n* The iPad Pro  has a fingerprint sensor but it is not the newer finger print sensor like on the iPhone 6S.\n* The rear facing camera is 8 MP and the face time camera is 1.2 MP.\n* There are four  portal holes for the stereo speakers and the sound volume is much louder and improved.  It makes the tablet the best sounding tablet I have ever used and watching a video is so much more enjoyable.\n* The slide switch on the side of the tablet for the mute/screen lock rotate is gone now. You have to make those adjustments in the operating system of the tablet now or use the sound volume switches.\n*It does not have the 3D touchscreen like the iPhone 6S.\n\nThe major differences in the tablet are the ones regarding performance and size . The CPU and GPU in the iPad Pro are just very powerful. In my video I show the benchmarking scores for the iPad Pro, iPad Air 2 and the iPad Air.\n\nIn my benchmarking I found the iPad Pro to be faster in performing standard tasks and the GPU graphics speed is faster. You can see it in using the tablet, loading apps, browsing the internet and editing videos.  I use Microsoft Office 365 on the iPad Pro to write documents and make presentations. I was shocked at how well is works on the new iPad and the split screen is wonderful.  I can open PowerPoint on  of the screen and my photo library on the other  and cut and paste items with ease.\n\nPros:\n' 10300 mAh battery with 10 hours of use time\n' Great sounding speakers for a tablet\n' Split screen feature is great\n' The screen quality is astounding\n' Much more powerful CPU and GPU\n\nCons:\n' Big in size and weight, it  makes it feel awkward and fragile.\n' Failure of Apple to have stock of accessories like the pencil and the smart keyboard.\n' Slow to charge, especially while using it.\n' The home screen space just looks wasted and too open.\n' No SD card slot for more memory\n' No USB data port for attaching accessories like external hard drives. I use the cloud to store documents for example.\n\nThe rear facing camera is now an 8 Mega Pixel camera with improved signal processing. The photos are 3264 by 2448 pixels in resolution and the video is 1080P HD. You can take time lapse video, have exposure control, take slow motion video at 120 fps, bust mode photographs, timer mode photos and high resolution panorama shots.\n\nBrowsing on the internet is faster and pulling up web sites and videos on the internet is just smooth and fast. The signal is stronger for the WIFI and things just pull up faster. Even syncing with iTunes is faster due to the faster CPU. This is an excellent product and I like using it a lot.\n\nIf you can take the size and weight it is a great tablet. I am very disappointed in Apple for not having the smart keyboards and Apple Pencils available for sale. My order for those items is scheduled 4 weeks after I ordered them. I find that to be ridiculous for a company of Apples reputation. This problem did not affect my rating of this tablet as a stand alone product.\n\nI own 18 different tablets and have extensively used them all. When it comes to getting a top quality tablet you cannot go wrong with the Apple iPad Pro. I rated it at 5 stars.  You might ask why is it still 5 stars after my cons?  It is still the best tablet I have tested and owned. It is powerful and easy to use. I can read all of my email, browse the internet, create Microsoft documents and work on my videos.  It is easy to share my work with my PCs.  I actually found creating PowerPoint presentations on my iPad Pro to be easier than using my PC. The big screen makes it much easier to do actual work rather than just the simple things. I can do 80 percent of the things that I spend my time doing on the PC on the iPad Pro.  There is still room for improvements but this is a very good product.\n\nIf you have any questions please contact me and I will try to help answer your question if I can."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0155KDJWA", "review": "This iPad was touted by Tim Cook as a PC replacement, but let me tell you that it's very very far from that.\nI can clearly see that Apple is starting to get worried with the success of Microsoft's Surface Pro line, so they just release a product which is half-baked with bugs and with a crippled operating system.\n\nIn order for the iPad Pro to replace a PC, it needs to have :\n1. File management system, where you can see all your files\n2. Cut the cord from iTunes\n3. Decent desktop quality apps\n4. To be as cheap as a mid-priced PC laptop\n5. To have a usable keyboard with a more adjustable stand.\n\nUntil it meets all of the points above, this iPad is just a device to watch Netflix and surf internet and nothing else. In other words, it's a glorified iPod touch."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0155KDJWA", "review": "impressions of the ipad pro after 1 week\n\nLet me say this first... the software keyboard in the iPad pro S U C K S , sucks big time...there is no feedback ...zero ..nada, no beeps, no key highlights, no buzzes, nothing.. Apple claims they have changed this for security... such arrogance! come on, at least let users have a choice to turn the feedback on or off. right now, it is like typing on a blank sheet of paper with a picture of the keyboard.\nAs I am typing this blog using an old $79 Apple wireless keyboard, i keep wondering if this iPad Pro is ever going to be a computer replacement\n\nlet me put that to rest....\n\nNo, i don't think this product is a computer replacement and is ever going to be a threat to the MSoft Surface Pro or even my old Windows/i5 based ASUS tablet. It is not a computer and it will never be a real computer unless it has the ability to run \"normal\" laptop software and have I/O capabilities like USB or SD card slots. Right now, don't donate your Macbook Pro or Macbook Air just yet.\n\nIs this iPad Pro worth the 2 year wait (for me)? Hell yes!\n\nThis is the best tablet i have even used. it is fast, bright and with a sharp display. It feels light, almost lighter than my older iPads, although the weight is 1.5 lbs. The display is clear and sharp and the battery life is actually quite decent. the sound quality is amazing..with 4 tiny speakers pumping out great sound. Watching videos on it is just a joy.\nI use this primarily for drawing and sketching, and I must say it is a great drawing tool.\nPaper 53 runs on this beautifully, so does adobe sketch ... and all the slew of paint and sketch software having a new lease in life..... the combination of a large screen and a fast processor makes this a fantastic drawing tablet... especially true if you are lucky enough to have the Apple Pencil ... (something I do not yet have and have been begging Apple store employees to sell me the floor demo ...with a cash bonus....)\nDrawing on the iPad Pro with the Apple pencil is so intuitive that you immediately forget that this s*** is electronic... it feels so real, you have so much control... even SUMI brush strokes are almost real looking. Water color is dripping off the tablet and pencil lines just glide smoothly over the surface..no skips, no shudder, no frizzies...great job Apple!\nIOS 9 seems pretty good, but I still cannot figure out what all the split screen hoopla is about. Yes, you can split the screen and see your photos and surf the web at the same time, but so what? You cannot do things like cut and paste from one app to another... at least the Apple employee failed to demonstrate. on the other hand, there are a number of Apps from Adobe that are really nice... like photo fix...and Adobe sketch\nI am sure more fantastic APPS will come ... this is one area where the iPad really shines over the Android and Windows tablets. The software/ Apps are just superior.. i am not sure why most of these wonderful graphic apps are simply not available on the WIN/ Android platforms.\n\nI have not tried the Microsoft Office Apps on this because they want me to PAY first if I want to edit!  In any case,  I am not hard up enough to do Excel on this tiny screen (yes, size is relative) or struggle with Powerpoint without access to a database... It is true you can work on these apps but why do it? it works so much easier on a real Laptop! After all these generations, Apple still do not allow USB or SD card plug in for iPads! This alone will keep it always at a tablet level .... and yes, I know there is the CLOUD .. and I also have my WD mycloud and dropbox ... but wait till you are out of WIFI range or in a foriegn country\n\nWill I be able to travel with this Ipad only? probably not... I still need my trusty old MBP to download and edit photos, or watch movies stored on a USB stick, or use office apps that i have already bought and paid for....  and one more thing , I like to see some tourist trying to take pictures with this giant iPad!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0155KDJWA", "review": "The good:\n- Stunning display.\n- Large screen is very enjoyable. Split screen is awesome. Totally different experience compared to smaller ipad.\n- Four speakers and surround sound is powerful and enhances user experience.\n- Apple pencil and the keyboard takes this tablet to the next level (of being a laptop contender)\n- It's the fastest tablet on earth. It's also faster than Macbook  and Macbook Air. Multitasking is smooth. No choking.\n\nThe bad:\n- Heavy and not easy to hold due to large size. Especially holding it one hand is a challenge unless you are Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n- Battery life could be better. It's not as bad as some other tablets but definitely not impressive.\n\nIs this a laptop replacement?\n- It depends. If you are a power user that is doing heavy multi-tasking using several applications, trying to upload photos, editing videos etc. this machine handles all performance-wise however you still will keep finding yourself you wish you were on a laptop. It's still much more easier and seamless on a laptop. On the other hand, if you just check emails, do social media and web browsing, edit photos etc. on your laptop, then iPad Pro will not disappoint you.\n\nShould you get an iPad Air or iPad Pro?\n- It depends. If you want to carry your iPad around with you everywhere, I would go with the smaller iPad Air because it's considerably lighter and more practical. If you will occasionally take it out and mostly use it at home or office iPad Pro is a better choice. Of course there is also money factor. iPad Pro is more expensive so you need to decide if its with it for you depending on how you plan to use it.\n\nDo you need the Apple Pen?\n- Depends. If you are an artist then yes. If you are an average user that is just enthusiastic to draw on your ipad and want to take some notes, you don't need to spend $100 on the Apple Pen as you will most likely use it a couple of times or not at all. Any cheaper stylus will do.\n\nDo you need a case for it?\n- Definitely. This is a big and heavy tablet. You will definitely need at least a back cover that can provide a drop protection. I don't like thick and heavy cases but I also didn't want a very thin case as I wanted protection. I opted for&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Luvvitt-Clear-Grip-case/dp/B0167G90D8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Luvvitt Clear Grip case</a>&nbsp;and I'm quite pleased with it. It's clear so it doesn't cover up the beautiful iPad Pro,  it adds grip, provides drop protection with air cushion corners and not too bulky.\n\nWhy did I give 5 stars?\n- Because I love it overall. The experience is different than iPad Air for me."}

It is fast, light and wonderful to use.  I have rated it a 4 because I disagree with some of Apple representations that it is a laptop replacement for many people.  Maybe, if all they do is simple tasks.  For me It is NOT -- it is a PAD, a consumption device.  It has no \"desktop\" feature like a laptop, it has no folder organization system for large projects or sets of files.  Its 128 GB storage capacity is very disappointing considering the size of the device.  For this to even start approaching a laptop device Apple should field a docking station, create an a platform to accept folders, allow you to save files to your folders and organizational systems (rather than shotgunning everything among their various applications), and expand the memory storage to at least 256 GB.  In fairness, there are workarounds with 3rd party products for most of these issues - but - Apple should have bridged those gaps themselves and maybe they will over time.  That said,I knew this going in and still enjoy the machine."}

Get ready to catch this wonder of 12.9 inches in your hand .. not in your palm as its quite big. The iPad pro is available in 3 colors space grey, silver and gold. I chose gold over those 3. but keep in mind you have only 3 colors to chose in iPad pro whereas in apples Iphone 6S plus I got many options. I was just eagerly waiting to meet and grab this new magic of 2015 by apple. I am really happy to have this one now.\nPreviously I owned iPad 4 and now I have iPad Pro. My little one loves to watch her Peppa Pig fun in iPad 4 and now she is watching it in iPad Pro. It's better to say she is more delighted and happier than us to get the iPad Pro as she can watch her Peppa Pig in a big vibrant screen.\nwhat I loved most of this new magical iPad pro are :\n1) After seeing the size I thought it won't be that convenient but once i picked it up it felt like a feather. Even with the bigger screen i can move around with it without paining my hands.\n\n2) Camera resolution is much better now with 8 Mp on back and 1.2 mp on front. I liked the front one because its perfect for selfies and skype calls.\nFor video it captures 1080 p video with back camera and 720p with the front. It sound good.\n\n3) Quad speakers are really good.\n\n4) the usb cable is longer than I thought.\n\n5) smart connection pin is there for using accessories like keyboard which was not there before.\n\n6) Split screen apps, multitasking goes best with quad speakers. I can check my mail at the same time while my little one is watching her favorite cartoons.\n\n7) Believe me it's super fast.\n\n8) The stylus is a nice one to practice your drawing skill.\n\nThe couple of things i don't like about it are :\n\n1) After using my iphone 6S plus it feels like I am going backwards because there is no 3D touch, no live photos.\n\n2) The stylus and keyboard are sold separately so your budget will go up to get this magic Pro in a whole form.\n\n3) It's cheaper in best buy."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0155KDJWA", "review": "I love Apple mobile products, but this device is just a bigger iPad, and nothing more. There really isn't anything special here. Sure, you can do split screen apps, and a bit of multitasking, but that's about where the advantages stop, aside from the screen being bigger.\n\nI've had an iPad since the first one was released. I've had the iPad 1, 3, 4, and Air 1. I greatly enjoy my iPad air, and actually prefer it over my Windows 10 laptop with a touch screen I love it so much I decided to buy an iPad pro because I wanted the bigger screen. Why did I want a bigger screen? Not because I'm 700 years old, or because my eyesight is 20/8799324, and I need my text to be bigger, but because I want more resolution space. I want text to appear on the iPad Pro as the same size, or even smaller, than it appears on my iPad Air, giving me more space to see more stuff all on one screen. What did I get? an iPad that displays stuff on the screen EXACTLY THE SAME WAY as on EVERY OTHER IPAD IN EXISTENCE. Instead of text being the same size as on the Air, it's bigger. It takes up the same amount of space, therefore making the bigger screen not worth it for me. Text settings are set all the way to smallest, on both of my iPads. It's a super disappointment, and therefore I am returning the THOUSAND DOLLAR giant iPad Air.\n\nNow, let's get into the issues I had within the first 24 hours of ownership. TouchID is SLOW SLOW SLOW. Sometimes I'd put my finger on the home button, the lock screen would start to unlock, and 20 seconds later the iPad would actually unlock. This would differ, depending on how long the iPad had been sitting idle. If I woke it up over and over again, it would take the typical 1-2 seconds for touchID to work. On my iPhone 6s, it takes only milliseconds of my finger being in the home button, for it to unlock.\n\nThe device completely died when it reached 100% charge, 7 out of the 8 times I got it charged to 100%. Every time I would have to hold the power/home buttons for 10 seconds, forcing a reset. I'd drain it a few percent, plug it back in and when I'd come back, it would be dead. It's being reported in many other places, and Apple is zero help. This issue is being reported on many forums all over the place. Apple is aware, but has no idea how to solve the issue.\n\nThe hardware is beautiful. It's a great weight. It's nice to hold. The screen looks as good as the rest of the iPads I've had. It's really fast, and gaming is amazing on the A9X processor. But iOS 9 is awful, which essentially ruins this iPad.\n\nSave your cash, and wait until Apple gets their crap together with iOS 9."}
