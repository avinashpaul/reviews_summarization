{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00K0OBEE2", "review": "I purchased this tablet for my daughter for a trip to keep her entertained in the car. Upon receiving the unit and opening the package, I was shocked to see a box for a black tablet of a different model, that also appeared to have been opened already. And finally, this tablet would never fit in the box that it was shipped in as the gel pad occupied way too much space for the little box. I brushed this off as a possible packaging glitch from the seller. Strike one.\n\nWhile going through the contents it has all of the run of the mill accessories, a charger, a usb cable. Nothing fancy for accessories, but then what do you expect for a sub $60 tablet.\n\nPowered the unit on. Verified the system specs and low and behold this supposedly 4 GB unit has only a measly 1 GB of Flash. Strike 2.\n\nBefore buying this tablet I did a little research from other websites such as this one.\n[...]\n\nThe website above claims these specs.\n\nThe Orbo Jr. 7\" Android 4.1 Multi Touch Tablet 4GB w/ Gel Case Features:\n\nWidescreen Display - 7 inch TFT capacitive multi-touch screen displays colorful, clear, and stunning images.\nMassive Storage Space - Built-in 4GB hard drive capacity for storing photos, music, and other files, plus 512MB internal memory. Supports external T-FLASH memory cards for expandable removable storage.\nIncludes Pre-loaded Apps - Some of your favorite apps like Skype, Netflix, Youtube, Google Chrome, plus plenty of games to choose from! The Orbo is an ideal tablet for both children and parents.\nStereo Speaker - Crisp and clear sound while watching videos on YouTube, or listening to your favorite jams on Pandora. Connect your 3.5mm headphones to the audio jack for more privacy. A built-in microphone is also included.\nDual Camera - Front-facing 1.3MP camera is ideal for Skype, Tango, web chats, etc., plus a 2.0MP rear camera for capturing life's unforgettable moments!\nProtective Case - The included durable gel case provides full protection from accidental drops and bumps. Rest assured, the Orbo tablet will remain intact while your child carries it around, either in the house or outdoors.\nColor Options - Pink, Light Blue, Red\n\nStrike 3. Where is the 2.0MP rear camera.\n\nWhile I understand this a cheap Chinese bargain tablet, I am more disgusted that the actual product received is not what I paid for. This is unethical to say the least. The seller should be banned from Amazon."}

It kept saying that the app was not responding. I tried a few other apps and the same response.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00K0OBEE2", "review": "This tablet is a very cheap alternative to almost every other tablet available; however, it was a very disappointing purchase. The included charger stopped working after just one week of use. The display quality is sub-par and the audio is about the same quality. The battery life after a full charge was about 90 minutes of watching videos or playing games. You could actually see the percentage trickle down ten or more percent in a matter of minutes. The 4gb of memory is barely enough for a few apps and games. We got to the point where we would have to uninstall a few apps in order to download a new game. We got about one frustrating year of use before the tablet stopped working completely. I tried three different chargers and it will not charge or power up. The only good thing about it was the included case and a pre-installed screen protector. It is now lost in our toy room in a sea of old toys that my kids rarely play with. Save yourself the trouble and look at other tablets before purchasing this Orbo Jr."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00K0OBEE2", "review": "We've had this tablet for 5 months. I love the silicone case that comes with the tablet, however, the 4gb capacity is much too small to efficiently operate. I added a 32 gb memory card, but the operating system takes up so much of the space and all apps, even ones moved to the sd card still take up space on the device. With only a couple apps all on the sd card, it takes several minutes to begin any app. I even removed all added apps, cleaned it, reset it and it is still extremely slow. While some might argue, well it's only a kids tablet, this has been problematic. My 3 year old keeps coming to me thinking her tablet is frozen, when it in fact is just extremely slow. I get frustrated as well trying to help her because it just appears to be frozen or you get the spinning wheel for several minutes before anything changes. It basically just sits around not getting used while our other tablets are getting use out if them. It's more headache than it's worth. I would return it, but my daughter cracked the corner of the glass."}

I have a Samsung phone and it connects to our WiFi without any issue.  This tablet will not hold a connection long enough to download anything (if it connects at all.)  If you can't download any apps or videos it's useless.  I also agree with the reviews saying the screen is very hard to see and low quality.  I'm just going to have to buy him something different."}

However, the option to download a movie directly to the device so it can be watch when wifi is not available, does not work. I even went through Google support! It's useless for watching movies in the car! On top of that major issue, her games run slow and sometimes remove themselves from the home screen. This device is crap!"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00K0OBEE2", "review": "I like this tablet and my son loves it. It works pretty well and is durable. My 2 year old has dropped it, stepped on it, and it only has that silicone/rubber like case around it. Surprisingly he has done NO damage to it!! So it's tough!! We ordered this right before Christmas as a present for my son. When we got it, we opened it to make sure it would be charged and to download some games on it, so it would be ready to go for him Christmas morning. Well when we first turned it on and started messing around on it, we realized that the very left side of the screen (the whole side top to bottom, but only a thin strip of it like half an inch wide) didn't even work!!! That part of the screen doesn't recognize you touching it!!! So some games you can't play properly due to it... We were pretty bummed and upset by it. I was going to return it to have it replaced, but it being right around Christmas time I knew we wouldn't get the new one back in time. So we just dealt with it. It's pretty unfortunate it came like that, but other than that we have had no issues with it and it still works well (besides that side of screen) and my son still likes it. So just beware and make sure you check it out to make sure it all works properly. I was gonna give only 3 stars cuz it came messed up, but it's lasted drops and being stepped on. Plus my son really likes it and it works well for the most part, as long as u don't get games u really need the left side of the screen for. Also since my son is only 2, he doesn't need a super fancy one and we'll end up buying him a new, better one when he is older and can take care of it anyway. We knew this one would be handled roughly so decided the whole trying to return it hassle probably wouldn't be worth it. Especially around Christmas time. So basically it's a pretty good tablet and definitely worth the money, but just make sure you inspect and check it out when you first get it to make sure it works properly."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00K0OBEE2", "review": "I purchased this item for my stepdaughter for christmas. Since she is only at our house every other weekend, i didn't want to spend a ton on a tablet that wouldn't be used much. The reviews were very skeptical but i figured for the price we would go ahead and try it. It came quickly,  arrived before Christmas. It was packaged very nicely.  However, the minute i took it out of the box, it felt incredibly cheap. It makes a crackling noise when handling it. The screen is not very secure and you can see a gap around the entire screen. The child proof case on it makes it very difficult to push any of the buttons. It also doesnt stay charged very long at all. I wish it would have come with a child safe system like the other kids tablets do. There is like nothing at all on the tablet so you have to do any and/or all installation stuff yourself. Im very disappointed in this product. Even at the price it was,  i didn't expect it to be perfect, but i assumed itd be better than this."}

Yes the interface is great for our 2/ 4 year old\nb.

Many times there is a lack of charge  but we cannot tell what the battery life is like on these products  it is not very clear what is the issue\n5) Videos  are very choppy  not sure what is going on with the product but luckily the kids do not care  but hearing it drives me crazy.\na. And it is not my house  we can be watching high def Netflix  and others are surfing with other devices with no chop\nb.

Between the hazy screen and the crackle when you put any stress across the frame, I was severely disappointed. Also, for a child's tablet, it had a lot of pre-downloaded things, leading my little one running into spam sites and downloading worthless creations by those people who have nothing better to do than program fake crap to make money.\n\nOnce I sat down for a while and disabled all the dumb things that were left on the tablet, I downloaded my kid's favorite games and played a couple. To my absolute surprise, I enjoyed playing the games on the tablet for a little while, they flowed nicely and even though there was a blue filtered hazy screen, the color was decent while looking straight at it.\n\nAll in all, it could be better, I know there has to be a better one, but also not bad for the money."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00K0OBEE2", "review": "I purchased the Orbo Jr. for my 5 year old and the Contixo for my 4 year old because I could not make up my mind and wanted to compare them instead of being disappointed with two tablets that were the same. The Orbo Jr. takes long to load and the biggest complaint I have with it is the lack of ease with parental controls. I didn't see anything that made it a kids version. In fact the picture displayed here is doctored, it comes with a beach background and is loaded with the same apps and open internet access as an adult kindle. I can't say enough about how amazing the Contixo is though which also runs off of Android. What makes it so amazing then any kid tablet I have ever had is when you load it up it asks you which apps you want to show up in the kids zone which is what it loads when it is turned on. Simply you control what appears and comes with kid friendly games pre-loaded. So games like Uphill Climbing, fruit ninja, etc. come loaded onto it without the worry of your child purchasing something because you did agree to terms, comes with no ads and no credit card info needed. The orbo Jr comes with none so I had to create a google account, download these games and accept the usual terms of giving them access to essentially everything on the device such as call logs,credit card info for ingame purchases, etc. If you have a toddler I would still suggest this over the LeapPads or V-tech tablets but not by much because despite the outrageous prices of their games and lack of full internet access they do have a lot of educational games that encourage learning by using cartoon characters they are familiar with like Disney and Nickolodeon characters. Which I forgot to mention the Contixo is a full tablet as well when you leave the kids area so there is no restraint on internet access or the other things you can do with Android tablets."}

Bought for my 2 1/2 yr old to be able to play just a few very basic toddler games.  Actually wanted a low cost low capability tablet for her.  Gave it to her on Christmas.  My 2 children only get 30 minutes a day of \"tech\" time.  So my daughter used this device for 30 minutes a day for about 2 weeks.  Speed is suuuuuuper slow even for basic toddler games.  The wifi turns itself off and cant be turned back on.  I have had to do a complete factory reset 3 times in the 2 weeks just to get it to work.  Now the internet won't even turn back on despite the reset.  And the battery life is comical.  She played for 30 frustratingly slow moving minutes then if not immediately put on the charger, the device is completely dead the next day (even if turn the device off after the 30 minutes of play).  Wasn't sure what to expect after reading other reviews so I actually bought this and the chromo 4gb tablet not advertised as the orbo jr (as kind of a backup).  It is the EXACT SAME TABLET just without the rubber bumper.  Also complete junk.  Very dissatisfied.  Will never buy anything from this company again!"}

It almost acts like a refurbished item....its very odd. We bought it to give to our 6 year old daughter for Christmas, but we ended up not even giving it to her. I need to play with it some more to try to figure out if it will be a good fit for her, but so far Im not impressed.

We literally had to recharge it every night and she could only get an hour of screen time out of it. My sons worked a little longer, however, the charging port was screwy so you had to hold the charger a certain way for it to charge.

It doesn't have a whole lot of internal memory, I had a hard time downloading some games for my daughter because they were too big. It does take a memory card, so that's nice but you have to go into the settings and transfer the apps to the memory card, it's doesn't do it for you. I'm not sure if that standard operating procedure for Android devices, I've never had to add a chip to mine. Lastly, it comes with some apps that my 5 year old doesn't need like email that can't be uninstalled. With the lack of internal memory, that's a problem for me.\nOverall, it was inexpensive and my daughter likes it so I don't hate it, but with the short battery life I'm a little disappointed."}

Terrible quality.\n\nThe third had so many glitches that required reinstalling apps and power cycling that we gave up on it.\n\nOverall a bad experience for 3 out of 3. I wouldn't recommend this as you'll likely have to replace it within a year anyhow.  We recently went with the kids fire and are much more pleased with the performance."}

It worked the first day I got it (kinda, because it didn't  want to turn on); eventually  I got it on and was able to get some apps on there for my girl. I made sure to charge it before putting it away for a month. I recall being extremely  disappointed with the screen--- the resolution was terrible, and if you viewed it vertically it was nearly  impossible to read any text.\nWhen her birthday came, we were able to turn it on (again , with difficulty) and the battery was still fully charged. She played with it until it was about 20% and I  plugged it back in. It never worked again.\nPut your money toward a galaxy tablet or anything else---this generic POS was a complete waste of money."}

I thought perhaps they just needed a fresh charge. I charged them again - same story - within an hour, they were both dead. My kids stream video a lot so I'm sure that's a contributing factor. Upon the next attempt, one of the chargers literally just fell apart. I replaced these tablets with Samsung Galaxy 4's and at three times the price, the functionality is much better with batteries that can keep a charge.\n\nI prefer the durable case that the Orbo comes with, however, that's the only feature this product has over the Samsung Galaxy tablet that we replaced with."}

When I bought this Orbo, in about 2-3 weeks the charger tip broke.  I replaced it and in about 2 months the charging area would short out (you have to wiggle it in the right position to charge), even though there is a cutout in the case to the charging port, it will not click in and you have to remove the silicone case where the charging port is in order to get a good connection.  On top of that when the tablet is charged, it barely holds a charge.  Lastly the screen looks very washed out and colors are dull, like colors on a the Sunday Comics newspapers.\n\nI thought after reading the reviews that this tablet would be ok for a kid with a little bit of compromise due to the low price, I get that but after several months this tablet wasn't even functional.  Save your money and get something better or go with the new Kindle 7 which is the same price and performs 100 times better.  This simply is not a reliable tablet and I cannot recommend it.\n\nHere are the pros to this though, while it worked, having google play is great and this tablet plays a myriad of video formats.  I inserted a microSD directly from my gopro knock-off into the microSD port on this tablet and it played it no problem - not even my PC would play it w/out special software.  Still, that doesn't warrant enough getting this tablet.  I would pass on it if you are on the fence...I wish I would have."}

It's a good thing I did, because it was on for TWO HOURS before I decided to do a factory reset and return the thing.\n\nI took it out of the package, plugged it in, and left it on the included charger for more than a day. The first clue that this was a terrible purchase should have been that the charger plug is too thick to fit in the slot over the port in the gel case. You have to pull the case off over a corner in order to plug it in.\n\nI turned it on and was surprised to see that the battery had only a 68% charge (8+ hours). I went ahead and set up some basic features and apps, testing the WiFi, browser, video, sound, and camera. The camera is as terrible as you'd expect on a kid's tablet, and thin, red lines flashed periodically around the screen when I tested Chrome. Two hours later, I see that the battery is down to 44%, I plug it in, and...nothing. Not charging. It doesn't charge on the included cable, nor on any of the three other micro USB chargers I tried. Thank god my kid didn't see it, or else I'd have to explain to her how terrible her gift was going to be."}

I have two small children (6 & 3) and these were bought for them to have in the car on road trips, while sitting quietly at the doctors office, ect. Not for everyday use. With that information in mind, this is how I woguld review this product:\n\nPROS:\n  - Charges quickly\n  - Set up is easy to understand\n  - Tablet has option in settings that let you turn off any apps you don't want kids on\n  - Apps run smoothly, as long as you don't leave too many open at once. But that's just common sense..\n  - Durable. My kids have dropped their tablets while walking up the stairs, no damage.\n\nCONS:\n  - Dies quickly if left running constantly. Ex: Watching a movie on Netflix will drain it much faster than just playing games.\n  - I have had issues with apps not working properly due to something in the settings that keeps flipping it to airplane mode. I would classify this as  a glitch, but a very annoying one. And it happens with BOTH tablets we bought.\n  - The charger slot isn't large enough to plug in the charger with the case on. I have to take the tablets out of their silicone cases before I can charge them.\n\nOverall, we are happy with these tablets for kid use. We have had them for 3 months now and still work great."}

This was suposed to be a gift for my grandaughter.. I called Amazon for a refund.. I just realized that they are refunding the case I bought for her to carry it in instead of refunding me the tablet! Looks like I have to make another call this evening!"}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00K0OBEE2", "review": "As far as kid's tablets go, this one is okay. It does have most of the apps the average kid would want. However, with that being said, I would not recommend buying it as there are much better kid's tabs on the market (like the Kindle for kids). This tab does not come with a \"they break it we replace it\" warranty like the Kindle does. It also doesn't have the speed of the Kindle. With that being said, we do use this as a backup tab. I have portable wi-fi, which is important with the Kindle. Parents who have Kindles for their kids understand why that's important. If you don't have portable wi-fi, this tab does make a great back-up tab for a child with a Kindle. However, knowing everything I know about the Kindle and how easy it is for my kids to use and how well the product is supported, I cannot truly recommend this tab as a primary tablet for a child. A backup tab? Yes. But if you are going to get your child a tablet, I highly suggest you go with the Kindle."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00K0OBEE2", "review": "The charger that came with the tablet broke in just a few short days. The tablet isn't very rugged which I expected since it is marketed towards smaller children. It feels flimsy like it will break fairly easy. Within two weeks of use it started freezing up and getting very hot while playing with it. The back casing of the unit popped off but thankfully popped back on. I even have the silicone case to protect it which makes charging it at the same time tough because the hole for the charger cord is too small. The battery life is pretty much a joke. Now the tablet is permanently froze up with a white screen that you can't get past. This honestly was a big waste of money. I'm so disappointed."}

I downloaded a few games for her and everything was going fine. I did notice the sensitivity of the screen is really bad, like you have to tap a button a few times for it to function. That was strike #1. My daughter played on it for only about 2 hours and it drained the battery almost completely, strike #2. So I put it to charge at about 7pm, and when I checked it at 3am, it hadn't charged at all, which at this point it only turned on to display the battery in the center and turned off again. So I tested the charger on my phone and lo and behold, charged it right up. That was strike #3. And to put the icing on the cake the camera was really low quality and the 4gb memory it speaks of, must be imaginary...being that we were only able to download 1gb in games... Ive never ever seen a tablet last less than 24 hours. Its really 0 stars...Buyers beware!!"}

First when I received the tablets one of the two was charged but the other was dead and that is the one with slight battery issues. Also the charger to that one stopped working the second day. The other little problem is that it doesn't have much memory so I have to erase a game or two just to download another but again they're for 3 year olds so it's not to big of an issue since my girls are satisfied. So overall it's an ok product but I wouldn't purchase this one for my 6 year old.\n Thanks"}

This Christmas gift is now dead and I have the great privilege to tell my daughter that she can't use the tablet anymore. The operating system for this product is old and half assed even though it's an Android.....nothing compared to my many Android devices so I have a hard time believing that it is actually the same OS. I strongly urge everyone looking at this product to look are reputable devices like the Amazon tablets or tablets made by technology companies like Samsung. They may be more expensive at first but they will last if you take care of them. iPads are also nice but Apple is more expensive with much better quality.

They are perfect for playing games. I have downloaded almost 10+ games so far on each tablet and still have alot of space to go for more games. They also like the camera part but if  your not outside or in alot of light then they aren't so good. They seem stable my daughter dropped hers a few times already and still works great.

That's was just one problem after the second try I could not get any thing on amazon to respond, I tried to go back but that didn't work. I went to Google but it took for ever to load. I have high speed modem and router so that's not the problem. I looked at the battery life and after about 10 minutes it went from 100% to about 50%. If you gave this tablet to a child he or she would be very up set that it responded so slow and I sure it would bring them to tears when the battery died in 30 minutes.

While we were extatic to find out we finally were \"privileged\" enough to purchase something at the height of the Black Friday selling festivities, our mood quickly changed after receiving these tablets and using them. We purchased a pink and a blue version for our kids for Christmas because we wanted to surprise them with a bit of technology. The first notable drawback came when the software on both tablets, while exhibiting the same Android Jellybean v. 4.1, had very apparent and differing appearances. On my daughters pink version, the camera kept turning on by itself every time you turned the tablet on...even if you didn't mean to. The overall appearance of the charging icon on both tablets were different as well. On my sons blue tablet, it was just a simple battery shaped icon used to indicate battery capacity. On my daughters, a colorful battery shaped icon reminiscent of modern smartphones. Not a huge deal except when it came to actual battery life. The four hours claimed by the manufacturer is a total lie. The tablets may actually only be in utilization for about one and half hours max before they would start flashing the recharge icon and it would be out of commission again. Throughout normal app usuage, the tablets would also freeze up for no apparent reason resulting in us having to reboot either the app or the entire tablet again. The nail in the coffin came today when my sons tablet finally gave up the ghost and will not even boot up anymore even after numerous failed attempts. Let me tell you my son was not a happy camper. If there is still a possibility to return both tablets today at this very moment, I would do just that. Do not buy these tablets unless you don't want to save yourself a headache in the long run."}

I was able to download about 4 apps for each niece on one tablet, since the internal memory isn't huge. The amount of videos they can record and pictures they can take is low, but again I say It's  GREAT For Kids. You also only get about 3-4 hrs of play time before it needs recharging, but I don't allow them to use it longer than an 1-1 1/2 hrs anyway.

The face I saw the day in front that was full of delight was now FULL OF TEARS, I watched as my daughter's HEART was literally BROKEN and my wife also began to weep as she tried to console her.  It was TOO MUCH TO BEAR.  Maybe I received the bad apple in the bunch, but don't just take my word for it, carefully read the review of others before purchasing this product, or if you do, give it a good testing because after 30 days there is no refund,which means there was no hope for me, because 30 days was gone before i even tested it and had no chance of getting my refund after reading up on the warrantee.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00K0OBEE2", "review": "I am very disappointed in this! However, it is still better than others.  Please read all of the review before you judge the product.\n\nFirst someone would need to be aware that this was purchased to replace my daughters tablet that was bought for her over Christmas. Her former tablet was purchased cheaply and did not have the power to run both the WiFi and the game that required the use of the WiFi (it was a DeerBrook tablet, similar to this one: http://www.amazon.com/DeerBrook-Google-Android-Bluetooth-Processor/dp/B00JLG84UC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1421945609&sr=8-1&keywords=deerbrook&pebp=1421945614103&peasin=B00JLG84UC).\n\nSo I saw a great deal on the amazon daily special to get this one for 76% off, or around the same price as the DeerBrook is without a discount. I purchased it in hopes that the programs would work and the tablet would actually entertain my child rather than irritate me as I constantly log out of the child lock and turn the WiFi back on, then log back in only to watch it fail within moments (negating most of the abilities of that specific program).\n\nSo the box arrives and my daughter seems to know it is hers before I tell her, hanging around me like it is Christmas again. I get it open and it looks pretty and new, with the bumper shield holding the tablet within it's comforting embrace while it is covered in plastic.  So I remove the bumper and then the plastic....and my heart dropped. This tablet looks EXACTLY THE SAME as the DeerBrook.  Same camera, same molding, same design....everything.  This is the same cheap piece of junk that I was trying to replace!\n\nSo, being in the IT field, I decide to test it out and hope that it is just a newer model.  Already upset that the Orbo brand is using the same machine as the DeerBrook brand I do not hold out hope that this one will work better.  Right off the OS is a bit more refreshing, not as old.  I note also that the memory capacity is much higher, from 512Mb in the DeerBrook to 4Gb in the Orbo. Additionally the processor is definitely faster.  After downloading all of the games and software it does feel like it operates faster and supports both the WiFi and the games at the same time. So I am still upset that the hardware is the same model despite being different brands and companies, however this is a more upgraded version of that model and it operates better.\n\nNow that the main fear is negated, I try to put the tablet back in the protective case, leaving the thin plastic sheet on the screen to protect it from a 4 year old toddler. It fits fine, and the buttons still work despite being a little harder to push.  However, the charging cable, a USB Mini, does not fit in the provided gap to the charging port.  Weasling it in works, having to hold it in to charge the device.  As soon as I let go the rubber pushes it back out.  So I remove the cover and trim that hole with some nail clippers to enlarge it.  I am glad that they had the foresight to put the hole there, but they should have tested it with the cables that they provide to ensure that it will function, especially with a toddler not thinking of the simple task of pulling the rubber away from the cable (toddlers will push it in, hear the beep, then assume it stays connected when the cable is pushed out by the rubber padding). The trimming needs fine tuned a it, but it will work.\n\nNow lastly the software.  This is advertised as focused for kids, and that is great, but it is still nothing but a weak tablet. And there is no special software included for kids, no kid zone (like Zoodles) preinstalled, and no games preinstalled.  So, a parent must create an account for their toddler (which BTW is illegal if the child is under 13 under multiple international laws) and download the games and software that the parent wants to have installed on the device.  It IS possible that you can use your own google account, however then the child can charge things on their own to your account, so creating a new one without a card attached is preferred.  The system can be made into a childs tablet easily, but it does not come that way despite it's advertisement.\n\nOverall this is a decent product.  It is more powerful than it's DeerBrook counterpart, and has a few glitches and QC issues, but will still get the job done.\n\nThis was received last night, I will provide further updates if the scene worsens.\n\nUPDATE: This tablet is loved by both my toddlers.  However they use it so often that the battery only lasts about an hour or so before needing charged.  The rubber still gets in the way every ones in a while, but I will not trim it further for fear of causing a tear that will rip the entire rubber protection off.  But app's that I installed the force the kids into a kid mode have been bypassed....not sure how since my tests show that it starts up and requires a password (and they do not know it).  But the kids have figured out to push a few buttons and the app's are ignored.  So, add to the lack of software for kids the fact that kids can easily bypass the security built into the apps that you can get.  Overall though, it works still.  The battery is a joke, but it works."}

First thing I noticed is that the cables to charge it would not fit through the odd smelling neoprene case that came through it. I had the same issue with the headphone jack. I initially thought the protective case *was* the tablet not just a ill-fitting cover. So the disappointment keeps coming.\n\nThe most telling thing about this tablet is that I had a dragon touch tablet that looks surprisingly similar to this tablet. After further investigation I discovered that Orbo has just rebranded the dragon touch tablet that my older daughter had been using for nearly 4 months now. I get that these companies all have the same products and just plaster their logo on it and call it theirs, but after reading the reviews in depth on this tablet I'm considering returning it."}

He was so excited to have his own tablet (we have phones and tablets that he uses but he has a nasty habit of dropping them). When we took it out of the box, we loved the rubber case that came with it and he loved the blue color. We charged it fully, however, when we turned it on the screen was so hard to see my husband made the comment that it reminded him of a hologram. You had to look at it dead on to be able to read the icons. Setting up the tablet was a not so funny joke. We went through the standard steps to set up an account to be able to download apps, and on the second step (creating a Google account) the tablet crashed. We tried it about 5 more times before I broke down and put in my own information (two year old was losing patience). I then download his favorite apps and gave him his Christmas present. I will say that he loved being able to open all his own apps and do his own thing. Two hours later, the battery was dead. I understand that apps suck battery power like crazy, but two hours is ridiculous. We were so disappointed that we had to ask grandparents to return it and get their money back. Do not purchase this item and waste your money. We will be buying the kindle fire kids edition for his birthday."}

Thankfully I was able to use a protection plan to replace one of the first two which both worked terribly - very slow downloads and uploads. She's 7 and cracked the screen on the first one. The second one would die in about an hour or two after being fully charged and then just stopped charging at all. This Orbo Jr. has been a good buy especially for the money! I liked that it already came with a protective case though I had a spare from the previous purchases. It takes about two-three hours or so to fully charge which was better than the previous ones. It's still working fine after more than a month - downloads and uploads relatively fast compared to other products in the $60 range. Bottom line - buy a protection plan especially if you are getting an inexpensive tablet or spring for the better product in the $175 - $200 range (still recommend protection plan if buying for children)."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00K0OBEE2", "review": "I bought two of these and they stopped charging after a week or two, BOTH of them. The USB-Micro cord is also pretty shoddy and I found I got a better connection with an aftermarket cord intended for my PS4 controllers.  Unfortunately I missed the window to get these replaced because they were purchased well in advance of xmas, and didn't die until around new years.  One thing I couldn't understand about these tablets was how they ALWAYS use the battery, even when they are plugged in.  Pretty much all basic smart devices will not do that, and switch to AC/DC power whenever it can to preserve the battery.  That is the fundamental defect of this device, and probably why the batteries die so quickly.  That being said, I can't imagine replacing these under warranty is really any kind of fix, since they'll do the same basic, stupid thing with a new battery.\n\nSo with pretty much nothing to lose, I tried something I don't recommend you do unless you have repair experience and know how to be safe around a soft cell battery.  Basically - I opened the Orbo Jr's and cut the battery cables where they are soldered to the logic board.  Now I've got two kiosks rather than tablets, but it actually solved so many problems with this device.  It boots up reliably, and the wi-fi doesn't constantly drop.  Sure I've voided my warranty, but that wasn't worth much in my opinion.\n\nI'm changing my rating to 1 star based on what I've learned.  These things don't have just bad batteries, they have bad firmware, and bad power management logic.  There is no \"firmware update\" in existence to fix this, and there really should be.  I can't imagine how the manufacture could pump these things out, sell them, and not know all this.  Will absolutely never buy anything made by Chrome Inc ever again."}

The one unit just stopped and the screen turned white and its screeching and making noises.  It actually really strange and then I I put my lg charger in it and it turned back on but is still making noises. Not sure what's happening but would like a replacement before a full refund.  I hope to get this problem resolved quickly ac my daughter is very disappointed.  Otherwise the units are perfect for a child."}

We charged them the first night and they would not charge with the chargers that they came with. The one got really hot and was making a squacking sound.  We were finally able to charge them with our samsung phone chargers.  The battery life in these are only a couple hours at best. They are very slow.  Not happy at all with them. I guess you get what you pay for. My kids are both young so I didn't want to spend a ton of money on tablets for them."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00K0OBEE2", "review": "I  bought 2 of these tablets in July 2014 as a Santa gift for my children. So you could probably imagine I didn't open them to test them out. When we did finally open them on Christmas the kids loved them. They are very children friendly  and easy to use. My biggest complaint is the charging and battery issues. It seems to take FOREVER for these to charge. One of them has a completely different charger than the other? I've attached photos so you could see the difference in chargers. So the pink tablet that has the DC 5V charging port as well as the USB charging port has an issue with the USB charging port not charging. I'm not sure at this point if it is a charging port or if it is used to connect to the PC? When I plug the USB charger into the pink tablet, it \"wakes up\" as most devices would, and in the settings menu says its charging, but doesn't show the charging lightning bolt icon like it does when I plug in the DC 5V charger.\nAlso in one pic you can see it had only been used for 36 minutes and the battery was already down to 53%. there is no way this thing will last 4 hours. Maybe it would last an hour or so. In all honesty I only allow my children to use them for about an hour a day any way, but that's not the point. I'm pretty knowledgeable about android devices and have added a battery saver to try and combat this problem. We shall see how that works. So both take at least 6 hours to fully charge for a battery that lasts an average of 4 hours??\n\nGreat tablets for children, but horrible battery life and even worse charging time!\n\nI would add that these chargers can be slow and laggy at times, but if you shut down some of the apps you aren't using, you'll get some speed back."}

A whopping four days later a two inch section of the screen was broken, with no known reason. Do I think that my five year old may have had something to do with the damage, even with her denials? Probably. Should a tablet that is marketed for kids last for more than a week? Definitely.\n\n It was only by the tablet being broken that I discovered the true shady nature of the manufacturer though. There was no warranty card included with the tablet. Conducting research online it becomes apparent that the company offers zero protection of their product, even in locales where it is required by law. The companies website was obtuse at best, and did not even list the product (search returned nothing). There was of course the 30 day return policy offered by amazon, but the tablet was ordered long before Christmas, so we are s***e out of luck.\n\nFor the few days that the tablet was whole my daughter enjoyed the product. Her crying four days out from Christmas because it is now broken and irreparable is my problem I guess."}

Before the holiday, we linked a Google account to each tablet and downloaded some age appropriate apps.  The kids were thrilled on Christmas day, and they immediately started playing games and watching videos on YouTube.\n\nIt's now a few days after Christmas, and the tablets have frozen multiple times, and each time, when they finally turn back on, the account information and downloaded apps are erased.  It's as if they are performing their own factory reset each time.  Their parents are spending more time reconnecting the Google accounts and re-downloading apps than the kids spend using the device.  My son-in-law is very tech savvy, but even he is confused as to why this is happening.\n\nWhen the do get things running again, there is a great deal of delay from the time you touch the screen to the time the device responds.  I understand these are lower end tablets designed for children, so I was not expecting lightening fast speeds, but this was much slower than I had hoped for.  I would understand if we were trying to run multiple apps, or had a lot of apps downloaded, but this is not the case.\n\nOverall, I am VERY disappointed in this product, and would NOT recommend this to anyone.  At the time of this review, the tablets are basically useless to my grandchildren and I will be purchasing something from another seller."}

We had to use our phone charger to charge the tablet and when it finally turned on, there was no home page/screen.  There was a reboot option and other options written in Chinese.  The screen is all scratched up and didn't arrive with a protective film that all new tablets normally have and the purchaser removes before powering it up.  We can't get the tablet to stay on - it always cuts off and \"times out\" constantly trying to download games for my 4 year old granddaughter.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00K0OBEE2", "review": "This is another review that I wanted to leave almost immediately due to some things that need to be brought to attention. I will leave an updated review if things change, but at most I will say that it is getting a 3 star review at most. We bought this for our daughter for Christmas.\n\nThis is an item that \"you get what you pay for\" obviously. I am going to start with the main issue. The charger power supply. I have attached a picture of what happened when I plugged it in, it is a good thing I plugged it in instead of my daughter, because it immediately arced and tripped the 20A breaker feeding the outlet. The outlet is not the issue, I tested it after this happened and it still works fine, the outlet was fine before this too. It is obvious that the power supply was dead shorted internally from the manufacturer and incorrectly manufactured. I have never had this happen with any power supply like this before, it is obvious that the power supply manufacturer is pathetic and has no regard for quality or safety. I had already contacted Amazon about this issue and they were easy to work with and responded within a few hours to resolve this. Because of this issue though, it is now going to reach 3 stars at best with me. We've been able to charge it on one of our laptop USB ports, so not all is lost.\n\nOn to the rest of it. Overall the tablet itself isn't bad, especially for the price. I have never really been impressed in my past experiences with Android anyway, the OS runs ok so far though, but in my past experience with Android, let time tell, after installing some of the updates it found some of the annoying errors with downloading went away. The battery life isn't very impressive, and it seems like it takes a long time to charge, but she is sitting in the chair next to me and has been fiddling around with it for over an hour and there is still over 60% battery remaining. It is also somewhat annoying that I had to remove the rubber case to be able to reliably plug in the USB/charger cable. The screen isn't the most Hi-Res screen in the world either, but it is an el cheapo kids edition tablet, I'm not expecting 1080p and a superior CPU in it. Overall, it really isn't horrible in spite of the negatives I mentioned from what I've seen so far, we don't regret the purchase so far, but the power supply issue is really unacceptable and I would recommend using caution when using the one included. It is still overall good for kid usage."}

Still, if you have any concern for your child's satisfaction and learning, you'd do much better to spend 3 X as much on a LeapFrog tablet--either that, or simply buy the child 2-3 books in his or her proper age range.\n\nThis is, quite frankly, a lousy Android tablet loosely modeled after the Fire tablet that Amazon sells for under $100.  There is nothing about the tablet that suggests it's suitable for a child except the ultra-thick, soft and shock-resistant cover.  The instruction manual is unreadable, so the buyer will need some computer experience to pull up a game or two for the child to use.\n\nI have the impression this was a \"budget\" tablet originally intended for adults.  When it didn't move, it was arbitrarily reconfigured as a children's device, primarily by slight modifications to the \"hype\" and one drastic change: the thick and spongy pink cover.  Surprisingly, the tablet has quite a few 5-star reviews--suspicious because they use the title to announce \"Five Star Tablet\" and say nothing about the machine itself.  Amazon needs to be told directly how unsuitable this item is.  At best, it's a \"mock tablet\" that 5-year olds can light up, carry around, and say: \"Look, I've got my very own tab-wet.\"  Cute, but it doesn't cut it for a wasted $40.\n\nI'd be surprised if Amazon carries this after the return date (Jan. 31).  So if you truly, sincerely believe it's worth all of 5 stars, better buy another within the next 2 weeks.  (I'd recommend returning it and purchasing an Amazon Fire tablet.)\n\nChanging the targeted consumer market for the product does not change the product.  In fact, the problems with the original product are simply muliplied.  Instead of one loser, there are two: the child and the parent who believes the seller's pitch."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00K0OBEE2", "review": "A family member wanted to buy this for my daughter for Christmas as an early gift this year. I told her we were looking for a tablet and she wanted to purchase, I was very wary about it since last year we had purchased one that only lasted for about one month so I wanted to make sure it was of high quality.  But since they wanted to buy it for a cheap price I caved and when it arrived after I saw my daughter playing with it with ease I thought maybe this one is better. After only having the tablet for ONE day the screen turned white with some lines across it and there is no way to take the battery out to try to \"reset\" it.  Turning it on and off and charging doesn't help either.  I would advise others not to go the cheap route, this may look like better quality but it's not.  I really hope the money can be returned because if it only lasted for 1 day I don't even want to bother trying another one."}

It isn't as slow as other reviews say, though it is kind of slow. The screen is actually pretty good, it is easy to use. It is a LEGIT tablet, not a \"child's\" tablet. The only child part about this is the case. The downs, the cameras absolutely suck. They're like cheap webcams that you would get. But it does have forward and rear cameras. The battery life isn't the greatest, but it's not as horrible as I've seen some of the other reviews say. I had it off of the charger for about an hour downloading apps and just playing around with it and it was just about to 80% from 100%. The worst thing is, it starts to overheat quite fast. But, for the money you get what you buy. For $60 you shouldn't expect a fast operating tablet or something fancy. For children, this is a perfect tablet. It'll also teach them patience, because as I said, it is kind of slow. It does feel a little flimsy, so make sure if you get it your kids aren't up high with it."}

The things I'm not wild about are: the speed, the incompatibility of some of her favorite apps (which I've somehow gotten around most by using a different appstore that was pre-installed on it than Google Play and with the Amazon app store), the memory size (a MICRO sd card is a must, it will not take a regular sized one), the camera quality, and the lack of display quality when turned to the side (should I say portrait orientation as opposed to landscape?) my biggest peeve.

I bought two tablets this Cyber Monday season; Orbo jr and Double Power Kids 7\" Wi-Fi Tablet, 8GB (AKA Dopo).  I paid the same for both $60 with free shipping.\n\nPros:  Price and bumpers\n\nCons:  The mini USB cable tip is not long enough to charge with bumpers on.  You have to peal the corner to charge.  Sort of a slow tab and the graphics are not so great.  I happened to buy a Dopo Kids 7\" tablet  (AKA Double Power Kids 7\" Wi-Fi Tablet 8GB) during Cyber Monday and paid the same.  Dopo is a \"kids\" tablet for sure and it has better graphics, speed, and 8GB.\n\nI would have returned this one and gotten a second Dopo if Office Depot would have honored their Cyber Monday price, unfortunately, the couldn't so I'm stuck with this one. Dopo comes with Mofi, which makes it a kid's OS,  but you can still run it in Android mode if needed.\n\nSummary:  It is still a good Android for the price, but plan on spending hours locking it down for a child.  If you are looking for a real kids tablet for a decent price, go with Double Power Kids 7\" Wi-Fi Tablet, 8GB Mofi installed."}

I'm not sure if it's inefficiency is because of the manufacturer or due to the company Seller1on1, but it runs really slow and freezes a lot. I believe that it may have been refurbished because the power button is very loose and flimsy, I tried turning it on and it wouldn't and the only reason it came on was because it had fully charged. Once I it was on there was an old video of a movie trailer that came out years ago. I tried to turn it off but once again the power would not work. I couldn't download anything from the Play Store once I signed into my google account, the apps were freezing or wouldn't load up at all. I don't know what the deal is with this product or company Seller1on1 but if you want a tablet go for an expensive one.

I bought a low cost one last year from eBAY and it was junk and wouldn't play even basic games or short videos so I was hesitant to purchase another low cost unit.  I was very happy with look, feel and size (just right for tiny 4 year old hands), and quality of this unit. I will be buying a screen protector and looking for a parental control program to limit what she can access on the internet (this is a regular tablet without such controls). Overall I feel this is a good product for a young user."}

Many are free & others that are low priced. This is a fully working tablet with a protector bumper wrap around that comes off to install more memory."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00K0OBEE2", "review": "This tablet is literally a piece of crap. The only game that it had downloaded on it already was angry birds. This was going to be for my 2 yr old but it's so slow and it freezes and stops responding so much that she doesn't want anything to do with it. I feel so bad that I got her such a crappy tablet that I purchased her games on my iPod and let her use that. I should have just spent $20 more and got her a tablet that actually works. It's also sad, too, because it was brand new when I got it. It charged only once and now it won't charge at all. I've only had this tablet for one day. Such a disappointment."}

Seller 1on1 happily exchanged our Orbo Jr. for another after they read this review. My daughter loves her tablet and the company went above and beyond to rectify the situation! Thank you so much Seller 1on1! We are very grateful! The new tablet works perfectly and has a great battery life! I recommend this seller to anyone!\n\n*****We are sending this back. We bought this for our 3 year old for her birthday. After opening it up and letting charge for 8 hours it immediately told us that battery was low. Oh and the external sound didn't work. My 3 year old wouldn't even use it due to the sound as she's only 3 and didn't want to use headphones. She shouldn't have to have only that option though. I was very disappointed in this tablet.*****"}

The first time we charged it it took all night (about 8 hours) to get a full charge and then lasted only about 90 minutes.  Now it still takes about 5 hours for a full charge and only lasts about 2 hours before it has to be charged again.  This tablet tends to get to get very slow for no apparent reason and eventually speeds back up.  Sometime the tablet appears to turn off by itself, and then will come back on.  We ordered this item for our 3 year old daughter thinking it would be a good, inexpensive option for the child this age.  While it is inexpensive, it is not good.  At the same time we ordered a DragonTouch 7\" for our 7 year old daughter which is working fine.  There is very little difference between the two tablets except the Orbo does not work well and the DragonTouch does.  And, the DragonTouch was about the same price.  I do not recommend this product."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00K0OBEE2", "review": "This is my first Amazon review:\n\nI bought this with high hopes that this tablet would hold us over until our daughter, now 18 months, reached an age where the investment of an iPad would be more meaningful. The fear was that a $500 purchase would end up broken before she could reap the numerous benefits. We are on a budget and thought this could help her be able to have an intro into the tablet world of apps.\n\nThis tablet made me feel like an idiot from the beginning. It took forever to charge, then when we finally turned it on, it seemed like it died within a hour of playing a simple alphabet game. Charged it again, connected to Netflix and couldn't finish a movie because it died again. I got so frustrated I set it on the shelf. I googled and didn't find much as far as support. Today I plugged it in to charge and it is making these long awful beeps. The screen is whacked. Soemtimes black, sometimes grey on one side with stripes on the other. I wish I sent it back after the first charge.\nThe directions are not very useful, I tried the rest option it said to do and nothing,\nThis is the first time I have purchased a \"deal\" on electronics and I regret doing so. I don't think I can return it anymore. Lesson learned."}

Booting up the the OS takes a good 3 tries, it does not load the first time you hit the power button... the 4th time's a charm. Like the protective case, has a great feel to it. So glad that this is my little daughter's tablet and not mine!!!"}

I'm the forever hopeful kind...\n\nOn day 2 though, I had to give up all hopes. This is why:\n\n- Tablet takes over 16 hours to charge\n- You get only an hour of battery life on a full charge\n- Tablet freezes whenever it feels like it\n- Saved videos disappear from the video folder upon exiting\n- Screen is quite \"insensitive\"\n- Screen doesn't lock (your little ones WILL press the buttons when holding it to play, guaranteed)\n- Cords are ridiculously short, so you can't use it plugged in unless you're sitting 6 inches away from the outlet\n- Instructions are written for Lilliputians (but you won't need it since tablet doesn't charge and has no battery life)\n\nSo if you're one of the few lucky ones, you might actually like this tablet. But my advice is to spend some extra money on a real tablet and a protective case. At the date of this review, the Acer Iconia is $130 and has under 10% of bad reviews. That's a good sign I should have paid more attention to before."}

The first thing I noticed was there were scuffs and scratches on the screen.  I attempted to wipe the screen, but they were permanent.  I was expecting to have to charge the unit as all NEW electronics have to be, but it had a full battery.  Netflixs and Google Play also were not working even after I updated the apps as they were old.  The adapter that came with it did not work and the tablet made a weird sound when plugged in.

Anyway it starts by making a slight noise when battery gets low then all of a sudden it gets louder then white lines appear on the screen . I uploaded a video so you could see for yourself ."}

The pink tablet came with a broken charger and both can not use the power or other buttons with the rubber protective case on. This is not a kids tablet. This is a regular Chromo tablet colored kid friendly with a bumper that has to be taken off to use, defeating the purpose. The battery life is also extremely short. We have had these less than a month and the blue one is already broken due to being dropped without the bumper. I am not sure it would have survived with the bumper because it is fairly low quality."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00K0OBEE2", "review": "I got this for my 18 month old daughter because she likes to play educational games on daddy's ipad. She was so excited to get her own \"ipad\". I got this one for the price and the fact that you can download real apps, because she already had her favorite games. The battery does die very quickly but due to her age, she doesn't get to play for a long time anyway. I charge it and then sit her down to play when I need her to sit still or to keep her from crying, such as in the van, or when I comb her hair, or when I prep dinner, so she plays for 15-30 minutes at a time. If we get in the van I give it to her to keep her from crying (she hates the car seat) and then when we get to our destination she puts it away. If we are out for 2-3 hours or so by the time we get back in its already dead. I haven't tried totally shutting it down before leaving it. I will try that next time. Another issue I had is the OS acting a little but buggy. The android will pop up and have a symbol indicating an error and I have to shut it off and back on again. Nonetheless, I feel it was a great deal for what we got. It is cheap enough that I won't be upset if she breaks it. My boys want one too but for them I might get something better quality since they are much older."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00K0OBEE2", "review": "I have a friend who has what I thought was the same tablet (same brand, looks exactly like my pink one, but blue) and that tablet has a lot of flaws, so I wasn't expecting much. I was pleasantly surprised with this tablet! The rubber cover seems to protect tablet very well. I was going to comment that if this was going to be advertised as a kids' tablet that it should come with a screen protector. Then, after looking at it, I realized that it actually appears to have a screen protector! My friend's tablet has horrible touch responsiveness and the charger has a bad connection; I have no such issues with my tablet. The responsiveness is great, WiFi connection is great, and processor speed is very acceptable. I have had trouble with some apps crashing, but that may be more due to the apps than the tablet. The only reason I downgraded one star was due to the fact that the battery seems to run out rather quickly. When you have a tablet made for kids, it's difficult to have it plugged in all the time. Consequently, I feel I may have a dead tablet more often than not. Otherwise, this a very respectable tablet."}

If this product has been designed with children in mind the designers have no idea -- switches on the tablet and the feel of it is extremely cheap and the electric cord connection is very iffy -- an accident waiting to happen; I have very serious doubts as to the ability of this tablet to last very long.\n\nIf you are looking to get a tablet, even for a child, then spend a bit more money and get a better quality tablet with certainly longer battery life.
