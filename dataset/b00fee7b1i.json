{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I've been using this tablet for the past week and am very impressed.  I previously had the Surface RT, which was great as it was... tended to be hampered by the Tegra processor and the closed ecosystem of RT.  While I think the Metro interface is the way forward for Microsoft, for right now it is nice to be able to use Steam and other gaming apps to build upon what's available in the store at this time.\n\nThe tablet itself is super light and quick.  I've been able to run fairly demanding games through Steam on it, and it doesn't miss a beat.  Multitasking is similar, just very smooth.\n\nI can say that I've spent some time playing with a lot of Windows tablets out there, and this is by far the best I've worked with.  The Surface and Surface Pro series are fairly expensive for what you get (the Pro is wonderful, but just isn't a tablet).  Build quality on this is great, speed is great, it looks nice, can be used in many different situations from work to home... just all around the best tablet out there (especially if you are just now coming into tablet territory).\n\nIf you want a great gaming tablet with thousand of apps, get an iPad.  If you want something that has access to PC and mobile games, plus Office and business acumen of Windows, you need to get this.  The price is stupid good.\n\nOne word of suggestion: get a great SD card.  Windows does take up a ton of space!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I've had this device for a few days and I'm pretty surprised at how much I like it. I originally questioned the value of an 8\" tablet - I got a Surface RT the day they launched and now have a Surface 2 and felt that I wouldn't want anything smaller. But now I'm not so sure.\n\nThe other reviews are pretty thorough so I'll just highlight what's top of mind for me:\n\n* Performance: The performance on this little thing is awesome, surprisingly so actually. Apps launch and switch very quickly.\n\n* Screen: The screen is fantastic. Very sharp, great viewing angles, and great colors. It's a joy to look at.\n\n* Battery: I haven't formally tested the battery life all the way to zero, but based on the drain I'm seeing so far, the stated 10 hours seems reasonable.\n\n* Build: Feels like a solid, durable device.\n\nSo far it's been a great companion device for me. I've been doing things like using the Reading List app built into Windows 8.1 to save webpages from my desktop that I read later on the Dell; the Kindle app; social media such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram; catching up on my RSS feeds; and of course email and general web browsing. I have the stylus on order and intend to use it to take handwritten notes with OneNote. And I know it will come in handy for watching movies when traveling, just haven't had it long enough for that yet. And it's small enough that I can pretty much take it with me everywhere, it's my digital man-purse. :)\n\nI think it's a bit unfair to list screen size as a con, or to say it's too small for running Office. That's kind of like buying a small TV then giving it a poor review for being too small to watch movies. If you intend to use Office, and you're buying an 8\" device, you should know going in that it's going to be tiny. But it's definitely fair to say that you'll need a keyboard and mouse if you intend to use any Desktop app, and even then, it will be tiny."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "Considering this is only my 2nd tablet ever I am enjoying it so far. My first tablet ( HP TouchPad) was cancelled along with all other webos devices and so I held off on other tablets till I found one I thought would suit my needs.\n\nPros:\n\n- great battery life. Even while updating,installing apps,playing games & watching some movies it has held up well for the first few days so far. Have not needed to charge it as of yet.\n\n- Feels good in the hand. The size may seem odd but it does work really well for me and the pattern on the back do make it easy to hold onto.\n\n- Weight is not noticeable to me but my last tablet wasn't exactly a lite so maybe that the reason this one feels better.\n\n- The OS while different didn't take long to get the hang of.\n\n- Apps  while not as numerous as say an android or IOS there are still quite a good many available . Honestly though even when looking at an IOS or android I never really saw that many apps that I found appealing or useful.  All the productivity ones I needed I found easily enough.\n\n- The card slot was easy enough to find and it accepted it without issue.\n\n- The speaker while small and in an odd spot worked well enough for my needs and plus when I do us it, I normally have headphones on any way so I don't disturb others.\n\n- Screen displayed colors nicely and worked well.\n\nCons\n\n- The desktop view is a bit odd. I see how this could be useful on a desktop or laptop but I really don't see the use for it on a tablet.\n\n- Office came with the device but using it on a tablet is not all that easy. all the icons and menu options are quite small and are much better suited for a keyboard & mouse input.  Maybe it just my large hands but without some other input method I don't see this as a true selling feature in the long term.\n\n-Button placement  is a bit off. The power button on the side and then just the windows button on top can be a bit tricky for me. Would have preferred it the other way around.\n\n- charge port is also on the side. would have preferred this on the bottom or top and with cover of some sort on it would be helpful to keep anything for getting in it.\n\n- camera is nothing to write home about. Front or rear facing seems to be a bit hazy and not the best quality.\n\nSo all in all I do like the device and its features. Just hope they fix the Office software and make it more tablet friendly in the future."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "Packaging:\nDell isn't going to win any rewards with the packaging. While it isn't unpleasant, nothing about the white slipcover screams interesting, exciting or note worthy. It blends into the sea of tablets and computers that have followed in Apple's shoes regarding the mostly white packaging. The front and back shows the tablet's appearance while listing some features and specs. Once you slide off the cover, you reveal a lightly-colored cardboard box with a very basic white tablet design and Dell logo. If the cover didn't exist, the packaging would be slightly more unique. Upon opening, the Venue 8 Pro is wrapped in typical plastic shielding that most tablets come in.\n\nIncluded Accessories:\n3-foot USB cord and power adapter. Must I say much more?\n\nOptional Accessories:\nDell offers a keyboard, case and active stylus on their website. I do not currently own any of them, though the stylus certainly is intriguing to me. If I buy any of them, I certainly will update this section.\n\nDesign:\nWhile looking at the tablet, you feel...nothing. It is a rather plain black rectangle with rounded corners. The side bezels are about 1/3 as big as the top and bottom bezel. On the front upper right, you can see the front-facing camera and some type of notification light. I am not sure what exactly the light is for considering it doesn't light up when I get emails. It also doesn't operate like a typical HDD light on a desktop or an always lit up \"On\" light. It does light up when using the camera, but I can't fathom that being the only use. EDIT: The light lets you know when the FFC is on and it blinks when turning the device on and off.\n\nThe back includes the 5mp camera in an ever-so-slight hump, silver plastic (I assume) Dell logo and a grey \"intel inside\" logo (thankfully it isn't a sticker). It is textured with with a circular ridge pattern that provides some needed grippage. No grippage isn't in the dictionary.\n\nThe top edge contains the \"Start\" button and the headphone jack. I quickly discovered that the \"Start\" button is next to useless. In portrait mode, I find moving my hand to the top to be more motion than a basic operation should require. In landscape, I had to bend my index finger more than I wanted on a repeated basis. Swiping from the right and tapping \"start\" is more comfortable and quicker. The left edge is blank. The bottom edge contains a service number sticker and a speaker grill. The right edge has the micro USB charging port, charging indicator LED, power button, volume rocker and micro SDcard slot. The USB port is in an awkward location right next to the power and volume rocker. When charging and using the tablet, it blocks the natural motion of your finger to those buttons. Also, the cover on the card slot is harder to remove with your hands then it should be, though it won't be something your messing with too often.\n\nScreen:\nVenue 8 Pro's screen does a fantastic job, even if the 1280 by 800 resolution doesn't exactly sound amazing. Everything appears to be crisp, even text in desktop mode. Images and videos are displayed wonderfully. Is it quite as crisp as the newest Nexus 7? No, but you will not begin to notice the difference unless you are using both at the same time. Viewing angles are up to par with any tablet I have owned, not losing much color or brightness even at the highest angle. Contrast is very solid, though I wouldn't mind the blacks to be darker. Brightness is plenty once you turn off \"Adaptive brightness.\" Responsiveness and accuracy provides a great user experience. In desktop mode, hitting small objects with my finger was fairly easy, just as good or better than tablets like the Nexus 7 2013, Nexus 7 2012 and Fire HD. I also never felt like I was waiting for objects to move when dragging my finger.\n\nSound:\nInitially I noticed the single speaker grill, and I had flashbacks of tablets of days past in which volume sound and quality was mocked even by smartphones from a few years ago. I then turned on a few Youtube videos to find the sound volume and clarity to be quite acceptable. It doesn't have much bass, but does any tablet? There also isn't going to be any illusion of stereo/surround sound. If you want this, grab your headphones.\n\nCameras:\nI'm not a camera snob, but, well...they are pretty bad. I have yet to use a tablet that took pictures worthy of even Facebook. All I will say is use your phone, considering most newer smartphones have pretty good cameras.\n\nPerformance/Heat/Battery:\nThis isn't the netbook Atom processor from 2007. It also isn't the sluggish Tegra 3 processor that haunted the Surface RT. This is a quad-core Atom looking to improve it's reputation. The Dell Venue 8 Pro is able to easily handle any metro app I have used up to this point. I can switch between browser tabs with ease, both desktop and metro versions. Controlling snap view doesn't slow down performance either.\n\nI just opened and switched between Youtube playing a video, The Verge website, WPCentral website, MS Word, the Store installing Halo, Skype and desktop version of Chrome without any slowdown or loading delays. Color me impressed. It also hasn't felt like the 2gb of RAM is holding it back. I wanted to test play Halo: Spartan Assault but something with the game didn't agree with the resolution. It looked and acted like a jumbled mess.\n\nThe device had some warmth to it when doing some more processor and SSD hungry things, but never got hot. At no point did I think I would need to put it down do to the device being uncomfortable. With this my first fanless, intel-based device, I was glad this never became an issue.\n\nI have never been able to tell battery life on devices well considering my consumption habits change all the time. I will say this though: it feels like I am getting just as good or better life than other tablets of similar size. Dell states 8 to 10 hours, though I am sure I keep my screen brighter than when they tested this. No matter what the actual number is, it is long enough to compete with the less functional ARM based OSes.\n\nWindows 8.1:\nI could write an entire review on the OS itself, but you can already find a million of those across the internet. I will cover some quick points though. It is easily navigated in an all touch environment like the Venue 8 Pro. 95% of things the average consumer does with a tablet can be done extremely easily in Metro view. This being the case, I still am very glad to have a desktop and FULL Windows. The ability to install other browsers is a big enough reason to go Windows 8 vs RT. This should also allow companies to adopt devices like the Venue 8 Pro considering they can use old software until more touch friendly versions are created.\n\nSnap view on devices less than 1080p can only have 2 apps open at once. This doesn't bother me considering any more would make the screen way too busy. Microsoft added a new feature when opening a new app while already having two apps open in snap view. The new app's logo appears in the center of the screen and waits for you to touch which app you want to replace. Not automatically replacing an app is one of those small design changes that makes me love 8.1 every time I use it.\n\nVenue 8 Pro also comes with the Home & Student version of Office. Microsoft is currently working on a more touch friendly version which will be very welcomed. That said, I hope that it is just a optional view and not a replacement. To start using it, you do have to activate the software by entering the product key. I wish this was done automatically, though far from a deal breaker.\n\nWhen upgrading my desktop to Windows 8.1 to 8, I was presented with a few tips on how to use the OS. When first starting with this Dell, I didn't get those same helps. I'm not sure why, but these need to be there to help your average consumer.\n\nMy single biggest complaint revolves around settings. While many of the basic settings can be altered using PC Settings, too often I find myself going into the old-school Control Panel to get the heavy lifting down. All settings should be available in both touch and click environments, with the typical control panel being hidden on devices like this.\n\nOne issue I had out of the gate was a watermark appearing on my desktop that said \"SecureBoot isn't configured correctly\". These are one of those things that shouldn't happen on a brand new device. I am not sure if it is a wide spread problem, but I'll bet I'm not alone. After about an hour of frustration, I was able to find a solution. Update bios, turn on Secure Boot and then turn secure boot type to \"standard\" instead of \"custom.\"\n\nShould you buy?\nTo me, the only advantage iPads and Android tablets have compared to Windows 8 tablets is touch-based apps, which mostly center around consumption activities. The Dell Venue 8 Pro can stand on its own just fine in every category besides touch based games. Are you most interested in playing the latest fad game? Get an iPad or Android tablet. Want a tablet to do anything else? Jump on the Venue 8 Pro when you can, esp. with the $299 price tag. It won't blow you away with sexy good looks, but it will allow you to do what you want quickly, easily and enjoyably.\n\nSpecs:\nProcessor: Intel Atom(tm) processor Z3740D with 32GB storage (2MB Cache, up to 1.8GHz Quad-Core)\nOperating System: Windows 8.1 (32Bit) English\nProductivity Software: Office Home and Student 2013 Tablet\nMemory: 2GB Single Channel DDR3L-RS 1600MHz\nVideo: Intel HD Graphics\nDisplay: 8.0 inch IPS Display with HD (WXGA 1280 x 800) resolution with 10-pt capacitive touch\nWireless: Dell Wireless 1538 Dual-Band 2x2 802.11n WiFi + Bluetooth 4.0\nCase Color: Black\nWebcam: Integrated 1.2MP HD Webcam (front) / 5MP (back)\nPower Supply: 10 Watt AC Adapter\nSupport: 1 Yr Rapid Return for Repair after Remote Diagnosis - Americas Best Support\nPhone Support: 90 Days Premium Phone Support\nPorts & Connectors: 1 x Micro-AB USB2.0 (for trickle charging and data transfer), 1 x Headphone and microphone combojack, 1 x 3FF micro-SIM slot (optional)\n\nDimensions:\nThickness: 0.35\" (9mm)\nWidth: 5.12\" (130mm)\nLength: 8.50\" (216mm)\n\nWeight:\nStarting at 395g / 0.87lb\n\nOfficial User Manual:[...]"}

Waited too long to open and test it, and the warranty period was long over, so I just bit the bullet on it. Otherwise, I think it would have been nice, hardware-wise. It has Windoze 8.x , and I never did the free urpgrade to Windoze10 with it, but I DO have Win10 on two other tablets- the ASUS Chi T100 and T300. To be blunt, I bought the 8-inchers for bathroom reading, but all I ever do in the short amount of time I power the T100 on, is sit and watch the BLUE SCREEN AGAIN, with \"Updating Windows, please do not turn your computer off\", and, the next power-up, \"Getting Windows ready, please do not turn your computer off.\" Literally. I've gone back to reading my girlfriend's recipe magazines. I DO NOT EVER LEAVE ANY OF MY EQUIPMENT POWERED UP 24/7/365 so it can do whatEVER it claims it wants to do. (And, no, I don't want to buy a bridge in New York, or a piece of a wall from Berlin, or Everglades real estate, thanks.) And I ain't buying, \"Just tell us when you want to schedule a restart, or when your computer won't be busy, and just let Windows use your logon credentials to re-start your computer to finish the upgrades for you\" ! \"Not gonna do it - wouldn't be prudent at this juncture\". Like our dear former First Lady said, I \"Just say, No\". I guess I'm not a big fan of Wyndoze any more. (Pardon the venting)\nI wouldn't recommend ANYONE buy ANY TABLET (including \"theirs\" with the \"surface\" on it) WITH WINDOWS 10 ON IT. It's too convoluted and bloated for a workstation or laptop, let alone a tablet. It is a horrible tablet platform. I would recommend having NOTHING to do with Win10 at all, if possible.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "The very sad thing about this device is they shipped with a Micro USB A connector. which caused many many people to be able to put the USB cable in the wrong way round , thus bending./breaking the pins and leaving the device a dead weight . One could not connect nor charge. Sadly this is the state on my device. I never used it much in the first place and the first time I charged it it started to have issues.  Someone said there is some recourse. but I do not know what. I guess there might be a class action lawsuit out there. i feel ripped off on this. Selling a product like this should warrant the manufacturer replace all devices with fixes for free."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "This is a nice tablet, but the precision stylus you need to go with it seems contrary... a regular stylus can be used for lots of things, but with such easy to double-click when only one was wanted, and hard to hit the exact right spot. The \"touchmousepointer\" software (not included, but should be) makes things easier when things are small. One negative is that there is only one USB port, used either to charge or for a device. This is a really stupid design: power should be available via a different port. Sadly lots of tablets went this route. Eventually Dell came out with a dongle that converts the one port to the two (one standard size)."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "This has been one of my most favorite purchases in the last few years and it has been well worth the money. I bought it refurbished 2 years ago and had no hardware issues whatsoever. I used it primarily for school to take notes and to be able to pull up anything i might need, including digital versions of school books. It being a windows tablet was ideal since i could use it in so many more ways than i could've an ipad. That ms office was included was truly a huge benefit as all of my school files were word, excel, or power point and using onedrive enabled me to store everything in the cloud. I was able to work on the files on the tablet, go home, or go to a school computer and pick up right where i left off without needing to worry about backing up the files or uploading them. It all happened automatically.\n\nSince it came with Windows 8.1, i was able to upgrade it for free to windows 10, which did cause a few issues in the beginning. Whenever i locked the screen it crashed and i had to hard reboot it, which took way to long and made it unusable, since i locked it all the time... it's a tablet. After 2 weeks of research i found the solution as i had to go to the dell website and download the new display driver. Thankfully i could use it again afterwards.\n\nAnother issue was that i lost the full version of ms office and was not able to restore it using the dell service. I still have the mobile app versions though which allows me to still do most of the stuff i need to. Anything more complex i can do on my home pc.\n\nOverall i'm very happy with it. The battery life is also incredible. I've been able to watch a couple of movies on it without having to recharge it, and lately i've used it to read books using the kindle app.\n\nA couple regrets that i can still work with:\n- Though i have a 64GB microSD card, it is limited what you can put on it. I hoped to put my onedrive files (20GB) on the microSD, but it won't let you, unless you set it up as a VHD, but then it just sucks the battery life away. The 32GB version which i bought is too small.\n- the microusb port has too many limitations. As many mentioned even if you have the right adapter you cannot charge it and have a flash drive hooked up, It also does not support micro HDMI, so even if you buy the right adapter, it will not let you output a display signal to a tv or projector (unlike the dell venue pro 11, which supports that feature)"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I wanted a tablet, but I also wanted a bit more control over the software I was using compared to an Android or Apple tablet. I also needed compatibility with some Windows only applications and I generally prefer working in that environment (especially with the file manager).\n\nThis is not Windows RT, this runs full Windows 8.1 on x86 hardware just like a laptop or desktop PC. It even has a BIOS. It has an Intel Atom Z3740D and 2 GB of RAM. The processor is a quad core, and while single threaded performance is a bit low (about the same as a Pentium 4), it doesn't feel too sluggish if you are running multi threaded software. Both Firefox and Google Chrome run perfectly.\n\nIt comes with a bit of bloatware by default, and a lot of space being used up by the recovery partitions so I would recommend reinstalling Windows 8.1 if you are mildly tech savvy to get the most out of the 32 GB internal drive. You'll need one of those cheap third party MicroUSB to USB hub adapters to do this (you can't boot from the MicroSD slot, you need to boot from a USB drive) and you can use the generic Windows 8.1 media creation tool from Microsoft's Website to get the installation media. Since the Windows key is stored in the BIOS, you won't actually need the COA with the key if you bought this tablet used and didn't come with it.\n\nYou will need a mouse or keyboard to install the chipset drivers (which contain the touchscreen driver) since you won't be able to use the touchscreen initially. All you need to install driver wise is the chipset drivers and combined WiFi Bluetooth driver. The drivers are listed under \"Venue 5830 Pro\" at Dell's website.\n\nUnfortunately even though this does run a modern x86 processor, Linux support is pretty a much a no go with this. It takes a lot effort to set it up to even boot into Ubuntu, and even then there will be no drivers for the WiFi or touchscreen and there will be major graphical issues.\n\nBe sure to also update the BIOS to the latest version, since it has fixed some issues with charging and power consumption."}

They wouldn't just send me a replacement.  I worked on the phone and via email with Dell \"customer service\" dozens of times to try to resolve this issue (over the course or several months).\nFinally, they told me to BUY ANOTHER unit and then just send the bad one in (that they would reimburse me eventually for the new unit)?  So their concept of good customer service is to say that I should buy another piece of garbage hoping for a reimbursement?  No chance.\nI guess I learned my lesson with this one.\nI can say that I will never buy another Dell product after this.  I own a small software development company and have ensured that we will not purchase Dell products after my experience here.  Maybe an over reaction to a single bad device, but the customer service experience I had with this was enough to make sure I will not go through it again."}

I got mine for $100, and it's one of the best investments I've made.\nBiggest issues I've run into is sometimes the tablet won't charge. I've left it in my charger overnight on multiple occasions, only to find that it didn't charge at all. I've often had to restart the device multiple times until it will start charging. Also, be wary of what charger you use. A low voltage low amperage usb charger (2V, 0.5-1A) will not sufficiently charge the tablet fast enough; even when idle, the charging rate may be lower than the discharging rate, leading to a drained battery. A 5V usb charger is good for standard charging, but if you're charging while using the device for things like browsing the internet or watching videos, you may end up not charging the device. 10V chargers are harder to find and are more expensive.\nHowever while the tablet itself is great, most of the issues I've run into are due to the Windows 8 OS. The network adapter stopping randomly is an issue I've had with other devices and other Windows OS's, the screen brightness not staying consistent is something that I've dealt with for years on my Win7 machine.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "Be warned that you'll lose charging capability in the near future and that will turn the tablet into a paperweight. On the Dell forums are hundred of people complaining (rightly so) about the known issue with the charging port.  Dell has yet to recall or offer to replace them.  It means that the tablet you are paying several hundred dollars for today will need several hundred dollars in repair shortly.\nHere is my experience: I used the chat option to obtain assistance from Dell regarding my Dell Venue 8 Pro which is less than 2 years old.  Via chat I was told I had to call for support.  Today I called and was told that I would have to pay a $19 diagnostic fee then the minor part replacement would be $159 and Major part replacement would be $269.  The consensus online is that Dell knows there is an issue with the charging ports on these tablets and has refused in most cases to do anything about it.  So much for customer service or support.  I had been very happy with the product until now and instead of staying with Dell I will spend the money not on repairing the Dell product but on a competitors product. I've been able to contact customer service for assistance of other tech products in the past and have had great response.  This was all around disappointing & reflects poorly on dell, both in the product and the support provided.\nIn short, the device works well until it stops charging which could be in a couple months or in my case, on the opposite side of the 1 year warranty.  I'll take a look at the HP windows tablet instead."}

This is the first negative review I have done on Amazon and I don't like doing it, but don't buy this product.  Not because of Amazon but because of Dell.

If you go to type \"youtube\" for example, it will type \"yoooooutuuubbbeee.\" Don't even get me started on trying to enter a password! The main operating system has died on it and had to be replaced and it's only a year old.

I bought this product in August of 2014 for use in my college courses. Back then it worked fine. But about 3 months later, I have had problems with one of the Drivers that I suspect was due to an update. I called Dell support, and after an hour of being on hold they were able to help me. They had me reset the device so I had to redownload all of my apps and files that I had accumulated over the past few months. Dell Support then helped me download the new driver. About a week later, the same problem occurred. Since I was busy with class, I just sucked it up and used my laptop.\n\nA few months later, I decided to call Dell Support again to fix the problem for once and for all. They had helped me, but within an hour the same problem occurred.\n\nFast forward to now, 2 months after I called Dell Support the last time. I restarted my Dell Venue 8 Pro this morning and suprisingly it connected to the internet. I got through about 3 youtube videos before I had connection problems again and I called Dell Support. After giving them my information, they said they could help me, but because I'm out of warranty it will cost $20 to troubleshoot and more to fix the device.\n\nSo there you go, no help from Dell. They couldn't help me the first time, the second time, why would I pay to get the same result a third time? Don't waste your money on this product. It's really not worth the headache."}

So you have to be very careful NOT to plug it in the wrong way. The cable is the standard micro usb D shape, I don't know why they used a square on the tablet side. It is very confusing and if you mess up the direction you can damage the port. I've been careful and this hasn't been an issue for me.\n\nBut apart from the shape, the port hasn't worked reliably. I can't depend on it charging when I plug it in, so I can't depend on this tablet. I've had to blow & clean it out several times to get it working again...I pickup the tablet and it's completely dead and unresponsive until I figure out how to fix it. I rarely have to do this on my android devices.\n\nLastly as a minor note, anything with an 8 inch screen doesn't work well as a laptop. You end up hunched over, and you can't just set it in your lap without a board as a desk. When trying to use this with a mouse and keyboard you end up holding the tablet in front of your face with one hand and then running the mouse with the other.\n\nWe have a chromebook and a nexus 7 now, and both \"just work\" so this is all but useless.

I'm not sure if this is an issue with the software for the onscreen keyboard, or the hardware itself. But tttttttttttttttttttttttthere's a frequent iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiissue where keys just rrrrrrrrrrrrrepeat themselves for absoluuuuuuuuuuuuutely no reason whatsoever. Good luck trying to type in a password on this thing.\n\nSecond, sleep and brightness adjustment functions. Brightness adjustment might as well not be there. Cast a tiny shadow across the face and it'll assume you closed the \"cover\" and want it to go into sleep mode. Most of the time, once it's in sleep mode, it's not waking up. You have to long-press the power button to shut it down and boot it back up.\n\nThird, the wifi. The radio likes to fuster-cluck itself for no reason; meaning one minute WiFi works great. The next minute, all connection drops. Reboot? Still gone. To fix it, you have to remove the wireless adapter, rediscover, and re-install it. I shouldn't have to have Device Manager and a reboot script pinned to my home screen, but that's how frequent this occurs.\n\nFourth, it seems to wake up at random when in sleep. So if you fight with it, trying to wake it up, and forget about it, it'll probably wake the screen up an hour later and leave it on until the battery drains. So next time you try to use it, no battery.\n\nIn short, this is not a completed product, I refuse to believe it passed any QA from Dell, so save yourself the effort and buy something else.\n\nAnd yes, my unit has all the firmware/driver updates available from MS and Dell. No improvement."}

I had previously bought an Android-driven one and it didn't last six months after I bought it (the battery swelled and most of the time the games and applications would freeze and a reboot had to be made).\nAfter doing some searching on the web I came across the Dell Pro 5000 and every single item on it works beyond expectations. The games run accurately, the internet connection is strong and fast, it's very easy to set up at the beginning. The only minor drawback is its internal capacity since most of the Windows applications cover most of the 32GBs on it however it is expected on a tablet this complete.

But then, it was $150 less than the 64GB model when I made the purchase, and I have a 64GB microSD card for everything I need, so the C drive being low on space has almost no impact on me.\n\nWorks great for touch friendly games on steam, and for those that aren't touch friendly but are mouse driven, the Dell stylus (purchased separately I'm afraid) works exactly as a mouse."}

I got my mom one of these tablets last year. It was working for a while, then wouldn't charge. The charger port on this tablet is terrible and is likely the route of the charging issue. The tablet was 1 week outside the warranty period. I hoped Dell would do the right thing and still offer to repair or have some workaround (the charging port issue is very common on the venue line, just do a quick search).\n\nWhen I called Dell, they wouldn't budge on the warranty issue and said if they were to submit it for repair they would charge $269 to diagnose and fix the issue. The customer service rep, didn't seem to understand why paying $269 to fix a tablet you can get new for <$200 was absurd. Now my mom is out a tablet and has a nice coaster. I'd personally would not buy this tablet again and would look for something with more robust build quality or warranty."}

I still prefer the iPad for consuming content, but the Venue is nice if you need to edit documents, browse the network, etc.\n- Very portable; I appreciate the form factor\n- Inexpensive; you get a lot of functionality for the $$\n\nThe not-so-good:\n- There's a single micro-USB port for charging AND anything else you might want to do. And I never figured out how to connect up a monitor to it.\n- The wireless has not been very reliable. It doesn't always connect properly, and the one time I put it into Airplane mode I had all kinds of headaches (including deleting and re-installing the adapter) trying to get it to turn back on.\n- The stylus is OK, but not great. It often doesn't work right away, and lacks precision. I tried using it on OneNote, but it's pretty poor.\n- Battery life is so-so at best. I find it usually doesn't last more than 4 or 5 hours on a single charge.\n- The tradeoff of portability is that the screen is small, and it's not easy to operate in \"full computer\" mode without a mouse and keyboard.\n- Having been spoiled by the apps available on iOS, I was very disappointed in the limited selection and relatively poor quality of the apps in the Windows app store.\n\nThe bad:\n- I've had my device for approximately 15 months. This past weekend, I accidentally left it unplugged (for the first time ever) and the battery completely discharged. When I plugged it in, it would not charge. At all. The charging light didn't even come on. All I could get was a one or two second orange light when I pressed the power button. Apparently many others have encountered similar problems; and it appears that it may be a battery quality issue.\n- I contacted Dell customer support to see if they could help. They just let me know I was pretty much out of luck, since I was past the one year warranty period. The only recourse they offered was for me to send it to them and to pay them to repair it. Given the low initial cost, it's hard to justify spending almost as much to have Dell fix it.  (I have, however, ordered a replacement battery for ~$70; it's not too difficult a DIY job if you're reasonably comfortable working with electronic devices. There are excellent YouTube videos that show how to do it.)\n\nBottom line: I mostly liked the portability and functionality of the Dell Venue 8 despite a few shortcomings - until it quit working entirely. Their customer support (in Bangalore or wherever it is) isn't going to be of much help if you've passed the warranty anniversary, so either be prepared to fix it yourself or to write it off as a loss."}

I attached no devices at all to this tablet, and ended up still getting bluescreen flashbacks from the 90s. I've gone through all the dell updates and windows updates, and then tried just restoring windows from the recovery section. Same problems. I don't get it.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "To take just one angle on reviewing the device, here are five points of comparison between the Dell Venue 8 Pro 5000 Series 32 GB model and the iPad Mini 32GB model.\n\nFirst, the iPad still does not allow the user to view and use more than one app on the screen at a time. Why this continues to be the case is unclear to me, but the DV8P lets you have two apps open at once. So you can read an article from your Facebook feed without leaving Facebook. Or you can go to a Web link that pops up in a Kindle book you're reading, while not having to leave and then navigate back to the Kindle app. Advantage: DV8P.\n\nSecond, the DV8P is more compact than a full-sized iPad, but close in dimensions to the iPad Mini. The DV8P is longer and skinnier, by a little bit. Its 8-inch screen size (measured diagonally) just edges out the iPad Minis 7.9 inches. To hold it feels about the same as the iPad Mini, though. Advantage: Both.\n\nThird, the Dell Venue Pro is both tablet and personal computer. You can use it as both. You can run full-on Windows programs from the Desktop side, which Apples iOS on iPad does not permit. This is a HUGE selling point for this device. I love being able to access full-bodied programs on this little tablet. Much as I appreciate certain software companies' iOS mobile apps, for example, being able to use the full desktop versionsbut not having to be at a desktop or laptopis awesome. Advantage: DV8P.\n\nFourth, the gesture-based interface of the iPad gives the user more options. Or is more intuitive. Or something. I know intuitive is a fuzzy word in software and hardware reviews. Of course, Im way more used to an iPad than the Dell Venue Pro, but the former is easier to just pick up and tap and swipe your way around. Advantage: iPad Mini.\n\nFinally, battery life on the 8 Pro leaves something to be desired, especially in comparison with the iPad Mini. Battery life when the device is in use is fine, but it does not hold charge very well when it idles/sleeps. If I put the tablet to sleep with full battery life, don't use it at all for a couple days, then come back to it, its completely out of charge. (I guess you have to make sure to remember to *hibernate* it?) Ive never had this issue with the iPad mini. (And Im not the only DV8P user to notice this, either.) Advantage: iPad Mini.\n\nCould you make this your only computer?\n\nA limitation is in the memory size. The Dell Venue 8 Pro comes in 32GB or 64GB models, but even the latter is too small to make this your one-and-only computer (think: lots of images and movies stored). The Dell Venue 11 Pro model, however, has a hard drive up to 256 GB, which is definitely workable for making the DVP your only computing device, if that's a goal.\n\nIf you're already well-connected to the Apple/Mac-only ecosphere of apps (OmniFocus, Nisus Writer Pro, etc.), it could be hard to invest in this device. But if you're platform-neutral in terms of your needs (e.g., Evernote, Kindle, etc.), this device could do just fine for someone trying to decide which tablet to buy."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "This was a gift for my niece for Xmas 2013.  The Dell Venue worked only for a few month before it crashed and would not boot not again.  My niece did not tell me till close to Xmas 2014.\n\nSince it was still under warranty, I gave her the option of keeping it or I would buy her an iPad.  She chose the iPad.\n\nGot Dell on the phone and they send a box to pull it to depot.  It was repaired a little after a week but my sister was handling the shipping back to depot and it was over the holidays.  The motherboard and the battery was replace under warranty.  Since my niece now has an iPad, I kept it as a vacation tablet rather than bringing a laptop.\n\nUsed minimally from Jan-Mar 2015 and in mid Apr 2015 while on a trip, it would no longer boot up so it is likely the motherboard again.  It is now out of warranty and had to talk to 6 people in call centers in India and Phillipines before I would get a quote for out of warranty repairs for close to the tablet price.  I did call a local place and they wanted $105 diagnostic fee to even look at it.\n\nPros: Comes with office\nCon:  Not very reliable and expansive to repair out of warranty."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "This thing is awesome!  I was hesitant, being an Apple product user, but it is surprisingly good!  It feels good in the hands and operates very smoothly.  Something about quad core and 2 GB RAM is awesome.\n\nI love that it's a full version of 8.1 and comes with Office.  I don't use it, but it's nice to know that I can get a BT keyboard and type away if needed.  The battery life is ok, but it does last 7-8 hours.  The charge time takes a while though - not sure if it's the charger I'm using or it typically takes that long, but I use it more for recreational purposes than for business.\n\n64 GBs is a must - if you have 32, it's like having an 16 GB iPad.  I did notice at times it got hot in the back, but after upgrading the firmware and whatever else needed to be updated, it runs pretty smoothly.\n\nHaving a micro-usb port is a plus as well, as I know I can expand storage if needed for documents, pictures, etc.\n\nI got it from Warehouse Deals, and I have to say it was pretty much new.  Still had 4 months of warranty on it.  I'm hoping to use this for myself (as I like the Windows platform).  The wife likes IOS, so I'll probably have to pony up for another iPad.  But it's always good to have all 3 OSs, so you can better align yourself with technology.\n\nIf you can get it on sale, well worth the money (probably better than Kindle)."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I bought this because I thought it was really cool and it is but after having it for about a week I soon realized that the screen is too sensitive in other words if I was reading something online while I scrolled down it sometimes zoomed in because it thought I double tapped the screen. After doing some research I found out that all the dell venue 8 pros had this problem and that other people who had this product experienced the same thing also having a screen protector on made it even worse. I ended up trading this tablet because I don't want a tablet that I can't even put a screen protector on because it takes one time for the screen to get scratched and then your stuck with it forever unless you buy a new screen which is usually expensive or you replace the thing. Other than that I really did like the materal it was made out of it was very fast and I loved how thin it was. If it wasn't for the screen issue I would still have it till this day and it would of gotten 5 stars."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "Note: This review was written for the Refurbished Version of this same model 32Gb 5000 Series, but is the same exact model.\n\nOkay First off, I have a long background in using Windows machines and whenever I was using a phone or tablet that ran android or IOS, there was always a thought in my mind that I was settling with somebody's workaround to get something done. When was I first was researching Windows tablets I went for the HP Stream 8 which was on sale and included free 200mb 4G for life with the tablet, but the memory was only 1GB and If i wanted to actually use it for productivity and not be frustrated I would need at least 2gb, which the Dell Venue 8 Pro includes in the 5000 series model (this one).\n\nOnce I received the Item,opened it up, plugged it in and gleefully waited I was a bit worried to see it wouldn't turn on right away. It had a white LED light on near the charger port, and turned orange as I pressed the power button. After looking into it a bit it appeared the battery came almost fully discharged, so I just left it charging for about an hour before attempting again and it turned on just fine.\n\nAs per a few other reviews on this product, there are many software updates (both from Dell and Windows updates) that should be done right away, but it seemed this refurbished model may have a few already installed as there was not much new detected from the included Dell software for detecting updates. The Windows updates on the other hand had a long list for me to install, which caused a little issue. Apparently if you try and install and update every required update at once it can sometimes be caught in a \"Restart loop\" where it attempts to update, then fails and retry's. I looked into this as well and if you space the updates apart a bit, just \"check\" a chunk of them at a time instead of every required one at once it should be much more smooth. The \"Restart loop\" did end, it just needed a hard reset (Power button for about ten seconds).\n\nWhen it was entirely up and running, I started playing with all the gadgets I bought along with it, including a folio case, a Microsoft Bluetooth mouse, and a USB Borescope camera! If you read any reviews on this so far, you will probably know you NEED to pick up one or more of the OTG (On the Go) Micro USB to Full size USB adapters. These are required if you want to use any peripherals that are not Bluetooth enabled. The other issue with Peripherals which is a complaint on almost every review is the inability to charge and use the USB port at the same time. There are many homemade workarounds for this, but I went to the easy way and picked up the official Micro USB charge and sync cable from Dell (About 20 bucks.. Yeah I know I'm lazy) so I was able to plug the tablet in to charge, and hook up my USB hub and plug in whatever I needed on that.\n\nThe other Accessory I picked up directly from Dell was their new version Active Stylus (A03 or 750-AAGN silver and Black). Since I got this tablet a little later in its life, I was able to skip the drama of its early iterations (A01, A02 the entirely black grey ones) and get a much better experience. The stylus works great right out of the box with the included AAAA battery and it has great tracking and pressure sensitivity. I draw web comics as a hobby and it is Invaluable to be able to sketch, color, finalize and publish a comic on a 8\" Tablet wherever I am. (I just use Mobile hotspot on my phone to give this guy WIFI whenever I need it)\n\nUsing the Tablet:\n\nI have tried several pieces of software as a test, trying to throw anything I could think of at it as a \"Stress test\". I have tried so far Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, and Mozilla Firefox with 20 open tabs, all at the same time. Surprisingly they all open up and are usable individually just fine, but If I take Firefox out of the equation it speeds up immensely because of the adobe flash running in addition on most pages. I am usually not causally using the tablet for whatever like I do with my desktop, and am using it for a specific task (Web browsing, Netflix, or Photoshop work) so this multitasking is not something I ever need the tablet to be able to do smoothly, but it is VERY impressive that it can handle it. I can definitely see it was an advantage to grab a tablet with 2GB of ram vs. the 1GB model of this one, or the HP Stream 8. The quad core BayTrail Atom processor (most similar tablets have this or something like it) is definitely a big plus in multitasking as well, and it so far handled everything I've tried just fine.\n\nI honestly have not really used the onboard cameras for much, as I have no need, but I did plug in a USB Borescope I picked up here on Amazon for about 13 bucks which has a LED light at the tip. This thing is endless fun with kids that love to see the inner workings of the dogs ear. Sound quality is also not a concern since I use earphones or a speaker at my workstation, although the sound is perfectly usable, and loud enough to show a group of people a Youtube video. Any audiophile will critique the hell out of it, but its good enough for me.\nWifi seems quick and fast to connect, so no issues there. People seemed to have issues with the start button placement on the side, rather than a capacitive button on the surface, but I know when I hold this thing, I would be accidentally clicking it a ton when switching from landscape to portrait, so I love its an actual button. The build quality is Superb, and it feel very solid, and never clicky or cheapy. Its light, but without the \"so light its cheapy\" feel.\n\nMy setup for at home productivity is a USB hub, usb wireless keyboard, bluetooth mouse. and when I am on the go, the stylus takes care of any small selection issues I would normally need a mouse for (if I am using desktop mode) and my finger works great for anything else.\n\nThe biggest thing that made me hit 5 whole stars for this guy, is that this is a Windows PC. A platform that has the most support, the most solutions, the most software, and the easiest platform to find solutions to problems. And since I have used windows PC's my entire life If there is a software issue going on, I can just do exactly what I do on my desktop. The possibilities are endless, and although a Iphone is like having a computer in my pocket, the Dell venue 8 Pro is literally that and more.\n\nPretty much whenever I need to use a computer for something, unless I NEED a big screen, I have absolutely no issues picking up my Dell Venue 8 Pro over my desktop computer to get things done, something an android or IOS device could never even dream of doing."}

I purchased the 64 GB version last summer (June 2014, I believe).  I liked it a lot.  However, in December 2014, it stopped charging due to a hardware defect (not a software of firmware defect).  It was under warranty, so I sent it to be fixed and it worked fine until last week (March 2015).  Now the warranty was up, and I have to pay $270 to have Dell fix it.  I could see if maybe it was a different problem, but this is the same problem they supposedly fixed just 3 months ago!!!  They should have a warranty on their repairs.  Apparently this is a defect in some units and Dell won't pony up and fix out of warranty units, even though it's a defect.  So, yours might work for a while, but if it stops charging out of warranty, fix it yourself.  Never again with Dell.  :("}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "The tablet itself is pretty good for the most part. It doesn't have a high end video chipset, but it does pretty decently with games from a few years back. It works really well as a Steam home streaming system with a PS4 controller over Bluetooth, in fact. There's just one thing that keeps this tablet from being a full five stars. Just this ONE little problem.\n\nThe power/USB port.\n\nThe port is badly shaped and easily allows the cord to be plugged in upside down, which WILL destroy the power port. There are a lot of reports of this out on the forums out on the internet. Even if you're absolutely careful, the port is still possible to mangle by just plugging it in correctly, too-- the misshaped port allows for enough wiggle room to strip the connector, too. With all the reports, I have no doubts Dell is aware of the issue, but they've never acknowleged it.\n\nI've had to replace mine twice within the first year, and have run in cricles with Dell support on the issue. My next tablet (and this experience HAS convinced me Windows tablets definitely have value!) will still be Windows, but it most certainly won't be Dell."}

Using Microsoft Office and PowerPoint on the go is fantastic for work. One minor annoyance is that the power button is placed very near the audio button, which makes turning up the volume a risky affair. Also, it doesn't use a standard head phone port.\n\nOverall, I'm very happy with the Venue 8 Pro. In fact, I would have given this tablet a 5 out 5 if it weren't for the stylus. When it worked, it was great. But like so many other reviews I've read it stopped working after only a month. The tablet is still well worth the expense, but it's a shame that it's packaged with a stylus that has such an obvious design flaw."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "What a disappointing purchase (I did not purchase this from Amazon).\n\nI bought it in early 2014, on impulse at my local bulk seller (foolish me).  Win 8.1 Pro on an 8\" screen seemed like it would be useful at times.  WHEN it works, it actually works well.  The Dell Stylus is a joke, they never got it right after several versions (and they seem to have no shame over this, they will ship it with a smile, knowing it will not work).  Perhaps a new version of the stylus (there have been a few) will eventually work.  I am not going to get into a  full review, many others have covered it better than I could.\n\nI really wanted to like this 8\" tablet, and like I said, WHEN it works, it works reasonable well (excluding the lack of a useful stylus), even with fingers, although the Win8 UI with fingers on *\" is pushing it.  The OTG (OnTheGo) USB all-in-one connector is not such a great idea but perhaps fine for many.\n\nI say \"WHEN it works\" because over half of the time, the unit will not power on (even after having been on charge for days, high rate or low rate).  Their powering up logic (and/or button) is flawed - but it could be a sleep logic issue as well, not sure.  In the end, it needs to work when I the consumer want it to work, and it simply doesn't.\n\nI have kept the firmware updated.  There have been many.\n\nOften I will grab the device when on the go, and then I just can't get it to power on.  This is frustrating.  I fiddle with it for 5-10 minutes and then I give up, for another day, and go reach for the larger Surface Pro (always reliable).  I will probably give this device away as it has cost me more fiddling with it to get it to power on, than it is worth.\n\nI gave up on Dell years ago and I foolishly gave them another shot here with the Venue 8.  This was my last shot with Dell.  With respect to consumer devices, IMO, they have been in decline for years and they will remain in decline.  Others can have different views and that is great, this is the free market, and I just gave my 2 cents worth for it.\n\nI am software developer of 30 years, have built 100's of systems, owned 10+ laptops (going back to the 80's), 5 tablet, and I have 50 IP devices on my network, including 10 VMs and 120TB of storage.  Trust me when I say that overall, this is the worst PC device I have ever purchased.\n\nGood luck"}

The only thing I can say is that I have never owned a tablet, I don't have a smart phone, and I've only ever owned a laptop. After purchasing a new Dell laptop this past year as a desktop replacement, I began to realize that is was a pain to lug it around with me if I wanted to be mobile. So, I started looking at tablets so that I wouldn't feel the need to haul the heavy laptop around. I had to do some digging, but found this tablet, and felt that this would give me the greatest bang for my buck.\n\nHaving this synced with my laptop is SO great - I feel like I don't miss a beat between working on my laptop and working on my tablet.\n\nI purchased a case with a BT KB and a stylus. Without those two things, I think I would go insane. The touch function is pretty sensitive, and the screen is small, making some things just too annoying to try to do on a touch screen. After playing around with this for awhile, I think I will invest in a BT mouse - if I can find a small slim one that I can take with me easily.\n\nFor what I use my tablet for (mostly surfing the internet, playing games, keeping a schedule, managing finances) I feel like I have plenty of storage space on this tablet. I did purchase a 32gb micro sd card so I can carry around pictures with me to show friends and family. With that, I have all the space I need.\n\nThis little puppy starts right up - no lag time. The only thing I will say is that because it runs full Windows 8.1, I feel like it updates a lot. I don't know with my limited experience with tablets if that's normal or not.\n\nConnect easily with my in home Wi-Fi network. It hasn't dropped the network once since I've been using it in the past week. I have yet to test it on a public Wi-Fi network to see if it picks up pretty easily, but I wouldn't see why not.\n\nOverall, I'm pleased as a peach with my purchase. I would say if you are already running Windows 8.1 and like it, you will be pleased with this new addition to the family!"}

Way too much messing around to get a simple tool to work.\n\nFor this device, everything has to be able to work together. In this case, it falls short."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I've had this for about 8 months. Despite the many issues mentioned (wifi often dropping, oversensitive/inaccurate response of the touchscreen,buggy stylus/pen, difficulty waking up from sleep and buggy restarting, I will stick with it mainly because it's a full Win8 Pro and the small size, not to mention I've already invested in a lot of accessories.\n\nI'm giving it one star only because I want to highlight a major flaw that is extremely easy to work around.\n\nDO NOT enable the \"Ignore brief or repeated keystrokes\" which disables the home button and the bluetooth keyboard. This setting is located under \"Ease of Access keyboard settings\" under Filter Keys.  When this feature is enabled, the hard home button stops functioning and your bluetooth keyboard, if equipped, is rendered unusable. If you experience either of these two annoyances, I am certain that disabling this setting will solve your problem.\n\nEdit 3/29/15--Performing a Complete Reset will solve all major issues and make it a 5 star purchase.\nAfter 9 months of daily use, I am now very happy with this Dell, but it took a lot of frustrating attempts at trying to fix issues mentioned above. Before literally almost giving  up, I gave it one more shot and did a complete reset of the device. (Here is how: Search for \"reset\", and select \"Remove everything and reinstall Windows\".) It took about an hour, and since I save everything on a micro SD card, all my files were safe. All i had to do was reinstall a couple of apps. You will need to reinstall or reactivate all programs other than Windows. For instance if you have MS Office, that will need to be reactivated, so make sure you have the code. Also, you will need to remember the user password if you want to link your device to your Microsoft account.\n\nIt's been one day since the reset and so far all the problems above are resolved, with the exception of the stylus pen, which needs a new battery, so i haven't tested it yet.\n\nI'm keeping it at one star to get the attention of those that are still on the fence.\n\nTL;DR: This will go from 1 to 5 stars after a complete reinstallation of Windows"}

After spending a week with it, I have to say that I'm really enjoying it so far.  It's great that it has the fully functional Windows 8.1 OS on it, so that I don't have to deal with pesky mobile sites, and install any exe's that I'm already used to (itunes, spotify, google chrome, etc).  It even has pretty good performance; Hearthstone runs smoothly at medium settings whilst also being very touch-friendly.  With two gigs of memory, it's also pretty snappy; I've not noticed any hiccups or slow-downs  regardless of the number of apps I'm running simultaneously.  The only fault of this device is that at 8 in, it can be difficult to accurately operate desktop applications as my fingers aren't particularly small.  However, this minor fault hasn't really detracted from the experience and I would definitely recommend getting this if you're looking for a mobile and inexpensive PC."}

That said, within a week I returned this version and got the 64 GB version instead. I would give the 64 GB version at least 4 stars easily.\n\nWith the restoration partition, and the base operating system and software, there isn't much space left. Several Gigs, yes, and that used to be a ton, but the problem is that this doesn't think it is a tablet, it thinks it is a full blown PC... and it is. And that means that it stores recently downloaded update files, it backs up your files, and it tries it's best to protect you from yourself with redundancies and backups.\n\nThe first thing I did was get and install a 64 GB Micro SD. I made it so any documents, music, videos, etc., were installed there. Any additional windows software I installed, got installed there. Regardless, after a week I had less than 400 MB available on the main drive and started to get messages that the device was out of storage. I had barely installed any software, and all but about 2 apps were on the external memory (apps through the windows store have to be on the main drive). The culprit was backup files and update files. If you really know what you are doing, you really limit the space that the OS has for backups, you purge unnecessary files frequently with a utility program, and you copy the restoration partition onto a flash drive and delete it off of the device (reclaiming 8 GB!) then this might be usable. Given the default settings and a typical user, you will quickly have no memory left.\n\nIf you are considering this device, get the one with more memory.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "Bought this from Office Depot using my rewards and got some free gifts so technically got this for less than $75!\n\nI have been using this for 6 months now.\n\nThe Good:\n\n- Thin and portable that can still fit in my jacket albeit bulky (because of the case I put it in).\n- Responsive, smooth and clear display (not Ipad quality, but good nonetheless)\n- Camera is good enough to capture detail and it has a bundled image enhancing software to correct the \"bland\" colors captured by the camera.\n- Wifi is fast...when it works...read on.\n\nThe Bad:\n- Windows fills up the main storage drive for some reason until you are left with less than 1mb even without installing anything in it.  I read about it and there's quite a number of people reported the problem and usually occurring after doing some Windows Update.  So anyway, I've supplemented this with a 64gb micro SD card which I install all of my apps.  But I would be trying a factory reset and do some fresh updates to see if I get that annoying problem again.\n- Battery is so-so.  Worst if your playing some graphics intensive games and that will last only for less than 2 hours.\n\nThe Ugly:\n- Wifi drops occasionally at the worse possible time.  And the worse part of it, if you try to reconnect it will state that you do not have the device.  And in order to fix it, you need to restart your device.\n- I bought my stylus from Dell to make sure I get the latest one.  It's awesome!  It acts like a REAL PEN....IT BLOTS, IT SKIPS...so a REALLY REALLY BAD PEN!\n\nThe conclusion:\nI'm sure you would buy this tablet mainly for surfing the web...and sadly due to the issues with the WIFI - you will be disappointed!  I did!  And some of you would want to buy this for it's note taking functionality with it's pen - you will be VERY disappointed!  I did!\n\nThis is the FIRST and LAST DELL product for me!"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I've had it for about a year now. Works great. I mostly use it for torrents where there's wifi to copy over to the pc later. I don't use it as nearly as much as I thought I would. I highly recommend buying the cover as cheap as it is both ways. I don't know if it's just mine that does this, but sometimes when I push the power button, it will not turn back on. Tip: this has happened to others as well, if you PRESS the power button on the top just to turn of the screen display and it does not come back on when pressed again, you have to HOLD DOWN the power button for 15 seconds (it will force shut down the tablet) and then PRESS the power button again and it should power back on, but it will not remember what you were doing last. Also on the right side on the screen there is some kind of tear going vertically down the screen every once in once in a while. It's only a pixel length wide, but it's still annoying sometimes. You might as well shut it down when not planning to use for a few days because the battery does drain, I think, a bit fast idle. BTW the tablet case does not auto turn off display like the ipad."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I'm used to using a tablet with Android so was very disappointed with Windows 8 OS.  The operating system took up so much space that Office would not fit.  The tablet seems to be just as described but lacks any excitement.  If you need a Windows tablet, this will be a good product.  It is faster than the Android version of the Dell Venue 8 and much more stable.  If I had the chance to do it over, I would get a Samsung Tab S or another Nexus.. Now I'm stuck with a Windows 8 POS that is just what was advertised."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "First, a bit of context so that you may understand this review.  I've had four tablets over the past four years, each one having a different operating system: Android, BlackBerry Tablet OS, iOS and now Windows 8.  That's just the way I roll :)  I tend to do plenty of Web browsing, Netflix and e-mail on my tablets, and very little of everything else, which partly explains why I can easily change operating systems.  If it has Twitter, Facebook, Evernote, Dropbox, Netflix, an email client and a Web browser, it suits me.\n\nI bought this tablet to replace my 3rd generation iPad.  I bought the iPad because I got a deal with free 3G connectivity included; having been always wary of iOS limitations, it was a love/hate relationship over the last couple years, but Apple fully deserves its place in the tablet market.  That said, I wanted something lighter, could do without the cellular connection, and wanted something that could multitask better than the iPad.  Having used Windows 8.1 for more than a year both at work and at home, I was ready to give a Windows tablet a shot.\n\nThe Dell device is very competitively priced.  I opted for the 32 GB model, which is cheaper, being fully aware that I was not interested in storing much stuff on it or installing many applications (the included microSD slot helps with the former, not so sure with the latter).\n\nFor the low price, you get a premium built device.  The Gorilla Glass-clad screen looks very good despite being only 720p.  Overall the device feels hefty and well put together.  The speaker is on the bottom (portrait)/right side (landscape), which helps get good sound relatively easily, tough as with almost all tablets, you're better off with earphones.  I was worried about the Start button placement, what with it being tactile (not capacitive) and being to the side, but after a couple months I actually love it that way.  I typically use the tablet in landscape and feel the buttons are very clicky and responsive.  Again, this device feels very well built.\n\nMajor hardware downsides include not having proper video output (i.e. no HDMI).  You can get a Plugera device to output VGA, which I haven't needed so far, but which seems cumbersome compared to the iPad's cable.  You could also wirelessly connect an external display using Miracast, but I think those are not too common.  Some people also take issue with the lack of a full-size USB port and the fact that if you plug a USB OTG adapter to get one, you cannot charge the tablet while USB accesories are plugged in.\n\nPerformance is very good.  It feels very fluid, boots very fast and doesn't stutter.  I do feel Office is a bit slow loading attachments from email, but it's not a big deal.  I understand the 64 GB model has a substantially faster SSD/flash memory, so your mileage may vary with that model.  Again, I'm only using this as a tablet; the netbook-like specs don't promise much if used like a full-blown Windows machine, but I guess having the flexibility to do so in a pinch is useful, and the tablet side moves pretty well on this hardware.\n\nOn the software front,  Windows 8 was actually a good idea from Microsoft for this form factor, especially with the 8.1 update.  I've used a Logitech T650 touchpad at work for over a year and really enjoy the smooth multitasking gestures, and on a tablet they really shine.  If you tell me one doesn't need smooth multitasking on a tablet, I reckon you don't usually chat and read.  Clipping two apps side-by-side is simply awesome (the email app does it automatically when opening attachments).  However, note that some things cannot be easily controlled from the touch (\"Modern\") UI; your mileage may vary once you're dumped on the desktop.  I'm surprised at how well I can target the tiny desktop touch points with my fingers, but then again I have long, thin fingers.  There's an active stylus available, but I haven't felt the need to get it yet.  Some things are tricky: for instance, having no love from Google means you need the Chrome Hangouts app, which is desktop-only and therefore rather tedious to use.  In general, desktop mode on this thing without an external monitor is a mixed bag.\n\nSome third-party apps are notoriously below their Android and iOS counterparts (Facebook, I'm looking at you).  Most are OK.  The real issue for apps-oriented people is that there are not too many.  Some big names are missing altogether from the Windows  Store.\n\nAs for the built-in apps, the email client is delightful and runs circles around Android and iOS native clients.  The calendar is OK, but the lack of Gmail integration is infuriating (I use OneCal,a free app, for Gmail calendar integration - it's good).  I've used Modern Internet Explorer before and it's surprisingly good, but I don't use it on this tablet, as I'm too vested in the Google ecosystem and hence use Chrome, which is OK for me but it only runs in desktop mode (see above about desktop mode).  And I just can't stress enough the usefulness of full-blown Office here.  I know we now have a very good (and free!) Office for iPad, which is also coming soon to Android, but having the whole enchilada on Windows is useful when you are checking Excel sheets with pivot tables and filters at work.\n\nBattery life is good for a device this size (unless you're used to the iPad Mini).  Empirically I'd say it lasts about 7 to 9 hours.  In practice, it carries me over the typical office day with juice left for some browsing at home.  A heavy day at the office for my tablet means about 4-6 hours in meetings, where I'll use it in short bursts to check email or chat throughout the meeting.  I do tend to use my screens on the dark side of things, so if you push up brightness things may not be so good.  See below for a very important update about battery life though.\n\nThree things that I have definitely not enjoyed and prevent me from giving out the 5 stars:\n\n(1) Sometimes the tablet will go to sleep so deeply that the power button can't bring it back.  In those cases, I have to keep it pressed for about 15 seconds, then press it again and wait for it to boot.  This is truly annoying.  I tend to not shutdown the tablet (just like I tend to never shutdown the Windows machines I regularly use, just sleep them for energy conservation purposes), and when this happens it irks me.  Thankfully it's been happening way less often recently -- I don't have time to Google around for solutions but maybe some update got it better\n\n(2) There was an update to the WiFi driver about a month ago.  It was good, because the tablet had bizarre battery life before it - it would drain completely throughout the day if you didn't use it (but still last its typical 7-9 hours if you used it).  The update fixed that, but now every so often the WiFi adapter just dies and the connections are lost, forcing me to either reset the tablet or go to Device Manager (desktop mode...) to disable and re-enable the device.  There are many threads on the Web for a similar issue dated earlier in the tablet's lifecycle, but this is different\n\n(3) It is annoying to have this device apply Windows updates, just like it is on regular Windows machines.  It takes forever and hits the battery life.\n\nIN SHORT...\n\nThe good thing about a Windows tablet is that, if you have a Windows PC, you can easily try out almost everything on the software front before committing to buy.  If you are OK with the limited third-party app ecosystem and are ready to handle a couple bumps, I think this tablet may be excellent value for your money."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "Firstly I'll say this: This thing didn't work well out of the box. I may be in that outlier group that ran into many issues at first, but I did and wanted to share with anyone reading this, that the issues are correctable, and once corrected, this is a 5 star windows tablet. I'll do pros and cons after I listed the issues and fixes.\n\nIssues out of the box:\n-Tablet self-shutdown when tablet goes to sleep (corrected with BiOS update)\n-Touchscreen spotty and finicky as all get out (corrected with BiOS update)\n-Crashed during major windows updates and would never take (performed one major update at a time instead of updating all updates at once)\n-32GB runs out fast (popped in external micro-SD card, storage problems solved)\n\nPros:\n-Tablet is fast. And when I say fast, I mean fast. Understand that this is a tablet, and not a high powered PC. For basic uses such as web browsing, watching movies, using Windows 8 apps, this thing is so beyond worth the low price. It'll do pretty much everything you could ask it. Having been a networking student, this thing runs office programs like a pro, ran packet tracer and other network programs like a champ, and never gave me issues with performance.\n-Screen clarity is phenomenal. It may not be a 1080p screen but it is HD and for the size your eyes can't tell the difference anyway, when watching video.\n\nCons:\n-Issues out of the box that may as of now have been corrected (I obtained mine about a year ago).\n-Camera on back isn't that great, but it is a tablet, not meant to be a photographers tool.\n-No full sized USB (understandable given how thin it is, but would still be nice if it at least came with an adapter or secondary micro USB ports.\n\nHonestly I love this thing. I generally hate Dell with a passion after going through so many dell laptops, but they did a good job with this tablet. I think the issue that the average consumer aren't willing to work through give this thing a bad name. But if you can do the research on how to fix the problems, this thing works great. Remember people, this is a windows tablet; sometimes they take a little more work to get into working order, than an ipad or android tablet."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "The tablet so far has been great and I am very happy with that aspect of the product.  I just learned however, after a very long hold with Dell Support, that the Windows Office that is claimed to come with this product is a 30 day trial version and you must purchase this software to continue using it.  I did not see that listed anywhere in the ad description or on the product packaging so it is very easy to misunderstand the value of what you are actually getting.  Just a tidbit of information so you can make your purchase decision a little more informed than I was."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "This should come with a patience warning. It's a great tablet but the initial updates make it useless for at least 8 hours while it installs them causing many people think the tablet is frozen or broken. If you do the installs, do it overnight (plugged in) or go catch a double feature. One of the installs makes the wi-fi inaccessible so be prepared to do some research online to undo the install. It doesn't take long to fix but it is aggravating.\nI live in both the Mac and Windows world but this was the best and most versatile tablet for the money. Added a 32GB micro SD and a cheap bluetooth keyboard (works great!) and watched some how-to videos on y-tube. If you are having problems, research online or call the help line. It's all a learning curve, just don't expect it to be perfect immediately."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "To start, I bought this Dell Venue 8 Pro Windows tablet from Amazon's Warehouse Deals (classified as refurbished). I expected this tablet to be more of a travel machine more than anything because I like to walk on foot (or otherwise drive) to places, and be able to carry light with my tablet to work on my work-related duties and my writing stuff (there are no good Android alternatives for Scrivener).\n\nI've only had this for two weeks, and initially wanted to hold back until a month or so longer for me to get a better feel for the tablet. However, I have to say that I'm impressed with this Dell Windows tablet. It could even be strong enough specs-wise to replace your laptop...provided that you get some gadgets for it.\n\nMost of the reviews rated high have done a good job highlighting the main pros, cons, and extra notes for this tablet. But I'll add in my experiences in this review.\n\n*PROS*\n1) This is no ordinary Atom processor (at least from past years). This is a vastly improved processor that can compete with entry level laptop processors via benchmarks. It's fast enough to handle daily tasks - it won't be silky smooth, instant-second speedy of a processor, however. The Core processors of Ivy Bridge and even Sandy Bridge in the ULV level are still superior - but don't let it deter you.\n\n2) To sum up on specs, the Atom z3740D processor is paired with 2 GB ram. Because of this, the OS is 32 bit - and this is good news mostly because the 2 GB ram limitations will be less pronounced. 2 GB ram is more than enough to handle most tasks and multitasking processes. That being said, it'd be a stretch to say that you can run media encoding and have 20+ tabs on Chrome open at the same time. But for those that are not considered \"power users\", this tablet will handle everything for you.\n\n3) The 32 GB eMMC storage isn't as bad as it sounds if you do the following: 1] Get a 64+ GB class 10 MicroSD card. You can install some programs or put movable storage into it. 2] Get 2 or 3 extra 8 GB flash drives and consider moving the recovery partition to each of those drives so you can clear the recovery partition stored in this tablet. It will free nearly 5 GB of space - which is significant. You can do one flash drive - the extra one or 2 are only backups however, and trust me you'll be thankful if you do backups of the backup.\n\nThere are more moves you can do to make the 32 GB a bit more roomy, but you can find that easily on Google search (and I didn't do any of the others besides the recovery partition part).\n\nThe eMMC speeds in read/write feels speedy enough to handle my programs, but it's still no SSD.\n\n4) Windows 8.1 may be a pain for some (and it was for me), but it's not that bad of an OS. It is a learning curve from previous Windows. The biggest takeaway compared to many tablets is the OS - you can install Legacy (aka usual programs installed in your laptop/desktop with Windows OS) programs in this; you cannot do that for Android tablets (at least, from what I know).\n\n5) Performance is terrific considering the circumstances. As said earlier, daily tasks (Office, Web, multimedia and even QuickBooks) work great for me. It performs well enough to be a main, primary PC for some!\n\nNow...gaming. This is in the iffy category because of the specs and the temperatures of the tablet. I can say that you can run some games in this pretty darn well - older games from Oblivion to even Mass Effect run well enough, but reduced resolutions and reduced detail are recommended. Diablo 3 can run fine, but the FPS will be in the high teens - it seems smooth, but not perfect. Battlefield 4 or games of that level are out of the question (due to the RAM limitations and the fact that the Bay Trail processors and integrated graphics are weak for advanced gaming.\n\nTemperature is another matter. If you want to do semi-heavy gaming (or probably even any), you might want to benchmark a bit on how warm (hot) your Dell Venue gets while doing gaming for even 10 minutes. For me, it gets warm enough in room temperature that it has me worried on its durability - during Mass Effect 2 for 30 minutes, the temperatures reached to the high 70s C. This is NOT good, considering that the tablet's processor tJunction is only rated at 90C.\n\nWhat you CAN do are two things, but I personally CANNOT vouch. 1] Consider the cooling mod that involves Arctic silver, thermal paste and a copper sheet (about 26 or so gauge) to put inside the tablet (there is a Youtube video that demonstrates the process, and has favorable results cooling all the way down ~12C from temps without the mod). 2] You can update the drivers and BIOS specifically from Dell, but quite honestly there are drawbacks - from eMMC/microSD speeds decreasing to performance decreases overall. Personally I didn't do it, but the BIOS updates state that the changes done were made to help reduce heating issues - which makes sense considering that decreasing loads = less energy = less heat formed from the loads.\n\nAgain, up to you. But if you do want to game on this tablet, you have to take to account of the temperatures and decide what to do or you might end up with a dead over-toasted tablet.\n\n6) Battery life is pretty good. It's not as great as other tablets (for this type of tablet, the Asus T100 can reach to 10+ hours), but for this, it can get up to 8 hours. Generally I'd reach 6-7 hours before being tempted to get a battery pack or charger to recharge. (If you're watching videos, primarily flash, it's about 5-6. Gaming will be probably at 3-4)\n\n7) To wrap up, there's WIFI, Bluetooth 4.0, a mono-speaker on the right of the tablet (when held landscape mode), a Windows button on the left with phone jack next to it, and volume controls that are next to the power button and the micro-USB port. There are 2 cameras - one in the front and one in the back. The quality for the back camera isn't the best quality, nor is the front, but both seemed good enough to use (I do not intend to use the cameras at all outside of Skype).\n\n8) Also, Microsoft Office came with this tablet. No Outlook, but having Word/Excel/Powerpoint/OneNote is enough.\n\n*CONS*\n\n1) Updating this tablet to the fullest, at least for Windows, is a PAIN. I spent the first 3 days trying to get it into shape, but failing because of the failure to update warnings during the latter end of the updating process. I even had to refresh to factory settings once. However, for some reason afterwards, the updates worked and I have my tablet running with full updates. Okay.\n\n2) I probably mentioned some obvious problems - lack of space, RAM limitations. These two belong here despite compromises (microSD for space at least) because there will be a time when you'll be worried about disk space being used up near max, or more painfully the RAM limitations. Now, most of the time it's not a problem but I did have Mass Effect crash due to low memory and also had to hard-reset the tablet once because the RAM was at max. So you do have to watch out your mileage - but otherwise, it's likely not a problem.\n\n3) Screen brightness is more of a bothersome problem than a crippling problem. For me, I turned off Auto settings because I did not like Dell's Auto brightness - sometimes it turned up too brightly for my tastes, or too low. Even with this turned off, I found the brightness at times to turn all the way up when I turned on the tablet or return to the tablet from Sleep mode.\n\n4) microUSB. There are NO other ports besides the earphone jack. Thus, for plenty of you, you will need a microUSB male to USB female adapter OTG. You can get decent ones easily on Amazon or elsewhere, but the problem as you might know already is the fact that the microUSB port is also the charging port.\n\nThus, you may be enticed to buy an aftermarket OTG cable that allows charging and using a USB port at the same time (which are hit or miss) or just buy a $20 one from Dell directly.\n\n5) On-screen keyboard. I'd recommend that, unless you're typing from portrait mode using your thumbs, to get a bluetooth keyboard (and mouse if desired) to utilize the tablet better.\n\n*Notes*\n\n1) As mentioned, get the following:\n- MicroUSB OTG cable\n- Case + bluetooth keyboard (Dell sells them, but too pricy. There are good alternatives for much cheaper)\n- microSD card (64 GB, class 10 at least)\n- An external battery pack if desired (this tablet can have up to 7-8 hours if you use it with low brightness, and occasional web surfing.)\n\n2) If using external hard drives, make sure to have a power source for that drive as the micro-USB port doesn't have the power to use the external HDD's.\n\n3) If you do have the microSD to use for expanded storage, I'd recommend to set it as a primary drive and not removable storage. I personally cannot say on how to do this because I've not done this just yet (nor did I have any need to do so). But it's an option and doable.\n\n4) If able, try to install Office into the microSD. Office takes up about 1.5-2 GB of space, so it's a space eater.\n\n5) I noticed quite a few complaints in the reviews about the wi-fi. I wish I can add some recommendations and help for this to those that do encounter problems - but as I personally did not experience any problems, I cannot say for sure what you can do. The best things you can do in general are to update drivers that Dell themselves recommend, and to research for forum discussions via Google search if updating fails.\n\n<Other notes may be added if desired>\n\n*OVERALL*\n\nOverall, this is a good primary machine for some. This is perfect as a complimentary PC - meaning that it can be a mobile machine while your heavy laptop/desktop can stay at home. You won't be doing massive multtasking tasks with it due to the spec limits, but it excels at the primary and daily tasks. Outside of the updating issues, I did not encounter any drastic problems. Unless stated otherwise, I rank this as a good buy for those that need a mobile Windows machine.\n\nRATING\n4.25/5 stars"}

Thought I try this which is really the only other competitor out there in terms of 7in tablets which is the perfect size IMO.\n\nThe problem with most 11in tablets is its too big.  It may work if you're sitting down or using it for an hour.  But I like to use it while in bed and may hold it for several hours and an 11in tablet will be just too heavy for this after a few hours.\n\nTechnology has come a long way and the power of computing without getting out of your bed is something I like a lot.  There is really no need to sit behind a desk to do anything - really outdated mode of working.  While I admit it does take practice to use the on-screen touch keyboard for work, this is no different from using your phone to text - was probably hard to type on that keyboard when you first text your friends.\n\nHopefully, the Windows OS will continue to improve as it is not a fully mobile OS like Apple's iOS.  A better Windows OS for touch devices combined with better and lighter materials may someday change the way we have to sit behind a desk in the office to get paid."}

Unacceptable from Amazon.\n\nHowever, the DV8P was as described out the box. Looks new. Just missing the wall charger but did received the USB Cable and the Microsoft Office Code inside the package, so I did signup and now have access to Microsoft Word, Power Point etc.\n\nI'm a Surface RT owner and was immediately impressed by the speed of the Dell Venue 8 Pro. It takes less than 15 Seconds to boot to the home screen and less than 5 Seconds to turn off completely. Getting into the Settings is also fast an smooth. I'm just so impressed. Updates for the tablet and apps just move so fast and smooth. I was slightly worried that I might need to get a i3 or i5 Intel chip but not anymore. Many apps that were giving me problems on my Surface RT are running smoothly, especially NBCSports, WatchESPN, Windows App Store, Comixology and VEVO. These apps now open quickly and operates much smoother.\n\nMy only complaint so far is the screen brightness. During my Night-Time Reading the screen is just so bright and can go no lower even if done manually. I however found that switching to vertical view, with black background and single page view helps reduce the glare. Battery life is very long too.\n\nThis is money well spent in my opinion. So, I'll be definitely looking into the larger Dell Venue 11 Pro for my Wife to use in College soon."}

I recommend adding a memory card and keeping your media there. I use it for reading and light productivity, almost like a laptop, using a bluetooth keyboard with it. I've used it for over a year, and I'm still very pleased. I plan to keep using it until it dies. That said, it doesn't really replace my Android phone. They serve different purposes.\n\n* Some people complain of music turning off when the screen turns off. This is a limitation of some Windows 8 Metro apps. Xbox music keeps the music playing with the screen off, as does TuneIn radio. Connected Standby is what the apps need to use.\n* On the other hand, some complain of the screen staying on and draining the battery. They must have changed the power settings, because that is not how the device comes. I have not had this problem.\n* I'm very pleased with the battery life after updating the drivers.\n* TouchMousePointer is brilliant 3rd-party software that makes the desktop very easy to use, no matter how small the text and items are.\n* This is a small computer, not a big phone (like my Android tablet was).\n* Update WiFi and Bluetooth here: http://www.dell.com/support/drivers/us/en/19/DriverDetails/Product/dell-venue-8-pro?driverID=4XGPM&urlProductCode=false&dgc=BA&cid=274207&lid=5128525&acd=12309196588294292"}

I took my Venue 8 on a trip to Europe for work and used it like a laptop, with a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse.  The year before I had taken a 17\" laptop that weighed a ton.  I was able to easily take my Venue with me everywhere, and used it for email, photos, pdfs, and even used autocad lt 2005 on it (don't know how it would handle the newer versions or any software that bulky.)  I use it like a laptop sometimes and like a tablet most of the time - it's versatile and powerful for being so small.  The screen is clear and crisp and it plays Netflix and Amazon Video perfectly.  It comes with Microsoft Office (minus Outlook.) I love being able to copy stuff back and forth to my computers on my network (try that easily with your ipad.)  I have never regretted buying this.  great inexpensive tablet."}

But I absolutely love having it around to look things up without having to boot up my laptop, or to bring on a trip with me. (I visit family a few times a month doing overnight trips, so it's fantastic to have this in my bag. I own an Etsy shop, so it's much better working on my business on the Venue as opposed to my smartphone.)\n\nIf you do buy the Venue, get the less expensive version of the keyboard/case (VSTNDEll Venue 8 Pro--Windows 8.1--Bluetooth Keyboard Portfolio Case), as opposed to Dell's, which is twice the price. It works great.\n\nOccasionally, I'll experience a glitch or two with the Venue, and I did have to have to have the charger cable replaced, as the first one went bad, but overall, it's great to have a fully functioning computer that I can just pop in my bag and take to the local cafe.\n\nShould Dell put out the next version of this, I'd recommend that it be just an inch or two bigger, to make the screen more readable. I suspect the new Surface Pro 3s have solved that problem."}

It works wonderfully. The touch screen is very responsive and Windows 8 runs smoothly as it's meant to do on a tablet. I blast up the sound on the tablet all the way up and this is one of the only tablets that I really love for the sound quality. You can turn the sound all the way up and it is nice and loud and clear, not like some other tablets that use cheap speakers.\n\nI use a iHome 7in blutooth Android keyboard cover that fits this tablet. Like I said, I brought it when it first came out and there wasn't much choices for covers or keyboards for the tablet. Why do I mention this? You'll want a keyboard to work with this tablet, if you want to really take advantage of the OS.The screen is small on the tablet and it's nice to be able to type without an online screen to type on."}

About 10 seconds or more, then let up and press it again until the Dell logo comes up.\n\nIf you leave the tablet on the charger for a long time past when it is charged, it will shut down completely.  That is a safety feature to protect the tablet from over charge and a possible lithium ion battery explosion like the videos on Youtube.\n\nThere is a way to reset the tablet by holding down the power button and the - (minus) volume button at the same time.  There is also a way to Hard Reset and then repair the computer.  I'll not explain that one, google it.\n\nI have had 2 DV8P tablets for about a year and LOVE them."}

It would be nice if the sides had this grip too.\nThe screen is quite accurate considering that everything is so small, but it's better to get a normal mouse for it."}

One is that the touch is terrible. i click on something it goes somewhere else. It is design to not work wit ha finger or somewhat. it can sense big stuff easily on the screen and not small buttons compared to apple and samsung tablets. Another would be the sound quality on this. It is not clear and get floppy when you turn the sound up all the way. Lastly the biggest reason why i don't like this product and returning it is because of its battery! ITS TERRIBLE. you charge it full and what you get is 1 hours of read and surfing the web or 30 minutes of video play. and once it turns off or turns out of battery, you have to wait 30 minutes for it to start up and not instantly when you plug it in the wall. i don't recommend this for a person that want to keep something like a pda, for movie watching or anything! On the other hand, it has a good design and feels good in the hand with nice packaging. that is it"}

It runs Windows Store apps and regular 32bit PC apps. Windows 8.1 Metro aka Modern UI is perfectly suited for a device like this. Having large resizable tiles for the main page is a BIG plus. However, when you go into the list portion below the \"start\" screen the icons and items are just a smidgen too small.\n\nUsing the desktop with legacy applications IMHO will require a stylus to be really effective. There are a lot of small buttons and menu items that are hard to get with the fingers.\n\nBattery life:\n\nI manage to get about 4.5 hours out of a charge when I use a CPU/graphics laden game with medium brightness. I feel that this tablet could use one more cell in it's battery\n\nMultimedia:\n\nVideo playback is excellent. The screen has a very wide viewing angle and is scratch resistant (Gorilla glass according to Dell)\n\nAudio quality will greatly depend upon the bead phones you use.\n\nThe built in speaker is adequate for speech and light gaming\n\nBuild Quality:\n\nNothing short of amazing. everything is nicely put together with logical placement of the buttons (with the power button at the upper left) The textured circular ridged back is easy to hold on to and it will not easily fall out of your hands.\n\nThat's about it as all the reviews have covered all of the things that you need to know.\n\nUpdate 08-15-15\n\nYou can install Windows 10.

It's very comfortable\n- It's Windows so I can do work on it\n- Screen resolution is nice\n\nBad:\n- It updates at odd times, and often will not successfully reboot, so the screen stays on, but it's black. During this time I am unable to turn it off (by holding the button for any length of time) or use it.  I am forced to wait for the battery to drain, then recharge it to be able to turn it back on.  A little frustrating to say the least, because you're without the tablet for an indeterminate amount of time, but never shorter than a few hours.\n- Lost the ability to connect to wi-fi a couple times. This is a common issue and there is a work around, but it's annoying and time consuming to have to look it up, then follow the steps.\n- Dell really wants me to connect to their service. I forget what, but it's pops up from my tray every so often, then stays for days.\n- The on screen keyboard has to be told to go back down, even after hitting enter and moving to another screen.  This wouldn't be bad on a larger screen, but on this little screen, it only leaves you with about 2 inches of viewable area in landscape mode.\n\nWould I recommend it? No."}

Normal troubleshooting such as driver updates and disabling-reenabling the wireless adapter don't work.

Dell tries to bridge the gap to give touch screen experience in a tablet that mimics a small desktop, but its a poor imitation even with the full OS.\n\nI bought this Dell 8 inch tablet because I wanted to have a portable device that was larger than my S5 smartphone for watching Netflix and streaming Amazon Prime and for exploring the internet, for surfing and for apps if they are simple to select and to use,. And something not overpriced. The market is flooded with tablets.  Apple is too proprietary with their software and their pricing is elitist, and people buy into it, its status and cutting edge but not really, its all sizzle and either you love Apple or Google, but rarely both.\n\nIn contrast-it was painful trying to figure out Microsoft's 8.1 OS on a touch screen. it felt like running uphill, the learning curve was a lot slower than Android, and I am a  25 year user of Windows desktop  Basically-other than the desktop mode, Windows 8 is worthless, I use the desktop which makes it just like Windows 7, for what I do its great, The apps aside from the desktop just don't grab me. Not important to me and not why I am returning the tablet after 24 hours.\n\nThese are the problems that killed the deal;\nYou cant zoom all the text, in a web browser, The tablet's font size was around 4 pts, or it looked like 4 pts because the resolution was so average. Either way there is no way to modify (i.e.  to enlarge) the everyday font size-it grays out to a default font size ok maybe 6 pts. It was like reading the aspirin bottle, I am 56 and can read small type but not that small, my point is good luck feeling comfortable when you are guessing what the web address is or the instructions you have to click to continue, it is tough, even with 2.0 magnification reader glasses I begrudgingly donned to help me. I got emotionally bummed out by the crazy lack of logic in navigating between everything and there is no back button on the tablet, you can touch a keyboard icon and bring up a keyboard within which exists a back button to page back, but there is no quick was to do it.\n\nThe way they have chosen to nest their settings options is a big waste of time. I guess I just like Android for a touch screen environment. And I don't mind a 2 yr old laptop for daily work, even without a touch screen, but forget this Dell 8-wait- I mean forget it with Windows! I am sure a Dell 8 is great with kitkat 4.4.\n\nWindows here is really over the top inefficient software by Microsoft, in my opinion. Dell makes a decent piece of hardware that calls out for Android 4.4 OS, which is what I will buy when I return this thing this week. I have had the tablet for 24 hours and that is already too long.\n\nIronically, even figuring out how to wipe it so i could safely return it was too much work. it is not an intuitive experience, not for me, a 25 year user of Windows. Don't buy this Dell Windows device unless you really think you are going need it, its not a fun toy for browsing websites.\n\nOh you can \"magnify\" with a tool that is pretty crude in its operation, or you can zoom everything you want except the top title bar of the window with the file commands and the address bar which means you are dealing with 4 to 6 pt fonts all the time, this is insane.\n\nI realize if I were more patient I could learn to live with it but honestly in this day and age where there are so many products available, why buy and keep something so compromised again unless you are a real geek and just laugh at my issues and I know there people who get it but I am half way pretty good at navigating around a device...I have an Acer Chromebook I love, and a Dell PC that is good and a Samsung PC which is really good.\n\nHere is the final point-the experience fails to liberate and fails to make you feel like you acquired a tool that can create intellectual leverage-it does not help you work better, it slows you down as the stupid OS gets in the way of whatever you were trying to do in the first place-and that is going the wrong direction for sure.\n\nDell makes a good product at a good price point but Google makes the best OS for a small touch screen device, at least for me that is the big conclusion."}

I had to wipe my tablet, but I disabled it after I got it working and everything has been awesome from there. If you need OneDrive that bad, just use the website or get an alternative Windows tablet. Being a web developer, I can just use DropBox, Google Drive, or just use my USB (On-The-Go Cable required). I did break my charger cord by tripping over it, but the port is fine. A new charger only cost about $20. If you get the 32GB version, get a microSD Card of at least 16GB. I am gonna upgrade to a 64GB MicroSD Card since I have large files. Gaming is decent, just don't expect to play modern games (Minecraft runs at 30-40 FPS with the right settings). If you use Steam, I would suggest using a MicroSD for it and it's games, as long as the MicroSD has a transfer rate of at least 10MB/s. I don't have the pen yet though, but I hear you need to update some Dell drivers for it work good. As it is full x86 Windows (Home Edition, the \"Pro\" at the end of the product name is to say it has full Windows), you attach a keyboard and mouse, you have a mid-range laptop. I find the scaling to be just fine, everything is crisp and clear. I also have no problem with only 720p HD, after all, I see no difference between 720p and 1080p. I also had no problem with Dell Support. Anyway, that's all."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "When you look at the specs of this thing, they're really impressive.  You get what is essentially a complete windows computer that is also a tablet for a fraction of the cost of apple or other offerings.  The construction is solid and they give you a bunch of extras with it.  It's a quality piece of hardware.\n\nUnfortunately, out of the box, it is badly, badly let down Windows 8, which is simply not a usable operating system.  Out of the box, you need to do everything you can think of to try to make it behave like a tablet should - you have to do your best to get rid of the useless metro mode in some areas, you have to look for and install apps for basic stuff like webbrowsing (like opera) to do tablet-friendly web surfing, and you're always just feel like you're fighting aganist it.  Even the on-screen keyboard seems badly designed. The win8.1 upgrade only improved things slightly.\n\nSomewhere in there you know there's a great machine.  But it's hard to find it through the clunky OS.  As a \"windows supporter\" it brings me no joy to say this, but I find myself going back to my ipad when i want to to tablet-like things.  And for desktop-like things, for me this screen is just too small to be useful.  I thought it might be a sort of laptop replacement, but it just isn't.\n\nThat said, this IS windows, and thus it's theoretically and in practice easier to code custom applications for it much easier than you can for ipad, and as such it's a tinker's dream for those who are familiar with programming on windows and who don't want to take a dive into the android rabbit hole.  it's also possible to deploy this as a \"small PC hidden somewhere.\"  I live in the UK but sometimes want to do things as if I was in the USA, so left one of these at a relative's house in the USA permanently connected to his ethernet (via USB - did I mention this thing has USB?) and I use logmein to access it.  So far, it has stayed up reliably, much to my surprise, though it took a bit of fiddling with the power options in windows to make sure it stayed on.\n\nGiven that this was available at a bargain price when I got it and is probably even cheaper now, these are incredibly good value, hobbled only, again, by a substandard and full-of-compromises operating system."}

Then I realized I wasn't saying anything that has not already been said about Dell or Microsoft's Windows 8.1 OS.  However, I do feel it important to provide *some* feedback so others might not make the same mistake I just did.\nI had two purposes for this tablet.  The first was to provide a bit more functionality than I had with my Kindle. Mostly to me, this meant a better browser, being more customizable and (as it is an original Fire) a bit more \"oomph\" in processing power and memory.  The second goal was to try out a Windows based tablet. I already have a few Android devices and I am not terribly enamored with iOS (not to mention Siri doesn't seem to like me for some reason), so this seemed the perfect opportunity to experiment with Windows. Besides, I already own a Win8 notebook which (after some tweaks) works for me.\nMy use case was having \"instant on\", watching the occasional video stream, doing basic online stuff (like banking, news, email, etc.), and something I could use as a cheap basic pc in a pinch when I travel.  Sadly, this didn't fit the bill for many reasons as Windows 8.1 is NOT a tablet OS and Dell's quality (driver, design and hardware) has apparently gone very far south. So given this,\n\nIf the above is your use case, stop here and go find something else.  The Dell Venue 8 Pro is NOT what you want and you will be very very sad.\nBUT, If you want a very-mini-pc that can *occasionally* be used as a tablet and you are willing to get a keyboard and mouse AND (I repeat) you mostly want a teeny tiny PC with a touch of tablet thrown in second, put this on your list and go find a loaner you can try out for at least a couple weeks.  It might work for you. In my opinion however, it misses the mark entirely.\n\nPS.  Don't bother with the pen either!"}

Debating whether to have them fix it again or call it $200 wasted. Wish desperately that it had stopped working during the returnable period. Dell really produced a lemon here, I am afraid.

I'd previously tried an Android tablet and its limitations vs. a Windows OS were multitude (too many to incorporate in this brief review.  So I decided to try a Windows 8.1 tablet and couldn't be more delighted.  I fired up this puppy and in 15 minutes appreciated just how \"right\" a Windows OS on a tablet is.  Several caveats, however:  1) you REALLY should get an inexpensive keyboard/case- it vastly speeds up your ability to enter text compared to the \"virtual\" on-screen keyboard, which I had trouble using without making double entries.  I ordered a keyboard/case which I'm very pleased with- see http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HA2MUQ8/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1.  2) given the small screen size, a stylus will save a lot of frustration trying to select a line or option on the screen.  An inexpensive one that works beautifully is http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00H8ZJ97A/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "1st off, if you're going to get this tablet, pay the little bit extra to upgrade to the 64 GB version!! It says it has 22.5gb but with Windows and what not, out of the box you have 8-10gb free space. I've downloaded some apps that's about 5gb and with Microsoft Office, it originally said I had around 2gb of space left, but all of a sudden today, I'm down to 360mb. It happens often, that something just eats up a lot of space and you're left with almost nothing.\n\nThe tablet itself, I've had for about a month. It is a little laggy, especially when I open firefox, it freezes for 3-5 seconds before I can do anything. I've had the speaker have this little static noise, and stops working for like 5 mins. It has happened to me twice.\n\nApp notification is off and on (for messaging, mail & facebook). Sometimes I get a notification, sometimes I don't and sometimes I get a notification 10 mins later.\n\nNot the problem much with the tablet, but the Windows Store is pretty empty with not so many apps. If there is a version of that app, it's a knockoff with ads.\n\nI just ordered the stylus recently so I will comment on that. Losing space randomly frustrates me as it doesn't tell me what eats up the space. The general overview just says apps take this amount, and pictures and videos eats up this amount. Doesn't tell me what eats up the rest. You can download onto the desktop a checker telling you exactly what takes up what space, but I'm not a computer junkie so I'm not sure what is exactly safe to delete and what is needed to be kept...\n\nEdit: I received the stylus, however, it's only been 1 day, here's my take on it: It starts making marks on the screen before the stylus actually touches the screen. Sometimes you have to click on things multiple times for it to register the click. I also got a 64gb microSD to add to this. It sucks that you cannot install apps onto the microSD as Windows 8.1 doesn't allow you to do that :/\n\nEdit: 10/15/2014 This tablet is outright horrible! So far after receiving it, I have had nothing but problems with it! After allowing Windows to update itself, I cannot open some of my apps and the sound starts working.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "Let me preface this by saying I've had an iPad 4, and a Kindle Fire HDX. This is my favorite tablet, period.\n\nFirst of all, let me start with the screen. You are probably like me, \"thinking 1280x800, forget it.\" Let me clarify a couple things. Yes, you can see pixels. This is not a \"retina\" device. If you are coming from an HDX or an iPad, it might take you a day or two to stop caring. However, the screen is very, very nice. And a higher resolution would really be a disservice due to the size of the screen. This is the right resolution. And actually, the screen has a couple of other things going for it, notably color and brightness. It's very nice.\n\nSecondly, the touch factor with windows. It will take you a couple days to stop fat fingering everything. Unless you are able to do everything from the \"modern\" UI and don't need the main desktop (which is unlikely), you will need to (heck, you'll want to) used the regular old desktop for some things. There, the touch interface and the smallness of the form factor will get to you at first. If you spend a lot of time there, you can do what I do and just plug in a usb keyboard and mouse if you absolutely need to....which is so freaking cool! I know you know you can do that, but the fact that a regular old dust gathering mouse works on this thing is just....cool. Anyway, you will get used to the touch factor, it just takes a bit.\n\nThe sound is nice and loud on this device. It is very clear, comparable to both the HDX and the iPad. I sprang for a Dell keyboard (which I'm using now) which is a little small, but it fits the size of the device and is plenty easy to type on. The Dell case is garbage--buy a different one.\n\nAll in all, I love this thing. I also bought a Bluetooth NES reproduction joypad and was playing some old school gaming on it. This thing handled it like a champ. I needed a few files to get it going...so I just went into my networked shared drive and copied the files over, and....all the things you can only do with a real computer. Now I'll switch into my Kindle app and use it like a tablet. Love it."}

As a load test, I installed Minecraft on the tablet and hooked up a wireless keyboard/tracpad combo. It ran at around 24fps, which was beyond what I expected. That said I really don't use the tablet for gaming. I mainly use it for email, youtube, and Remote Desktop management of all the servers at work. Battery life is fantastic for how I use it, the tablet barely sips power when it is sleeping. Very capable for the price point."}

Often I can't get the onscreen keyboard to auto pop and when I manually load it I can't put it the focus on the field I need to type due to the response time/no response to touch. Even tabbing on the keyboard won't work. I'm using a blue tooth keyboard that may be part of the issue. Wndows 8.1 is preloaded and way too small for an OS. Plus Windows 8.1 is just a bad design in my opinion. This device needs to be tablet only. It's so painful to bring anything up due to the touch being so poor that I hadn't used it in several months. I brought it back out on a lazy Sunday to see if maybe some updates would get it working. Says Updates available. Go to PC settings to install them. Really. Would a novice know how to get to PC Settings. It's not on the home screen. I go t to PC Settings and there is nothing to indicate what to do next. You have to go to Change PC Settings to get to the update option. Windows 8 feature. Terrible logic. Still have touch issues after the updates. Also, the charger cable is way too short. I can't sit on my couch with it plugged in like every other device I've ever purchased. I think you get the point. Don't buy. I can't even give this to my kid or she'll hate technology.

The 8 inch size works well sitting outside drinking a adult beverage on my deck and on a airplane where space is limited.\n\nThe processor (1.83GHz Quad Core) and memory (2 GB) combo is speedy enough for light work with mail, Facebook, and web surfing but not intended for Architectural Design applications or heavy duty gamer fun.\n\nSimple with convenient connections with one micro USB2 (for trickle charging and data transfer), one headphone and microphone combo-jack and one micro SD memory card slot.  Simple keeps the cost minimal.  Note: you can't use a standard USB cable for file transfer, you need Micro USB to USB OTG Host Adapter which I bought on Amazon from StarTech.\n\nA few issues:  one is the screen brightness seems to randomly go dim, then pop back to as if it has a faulty connection.  Also note if you have human fingers (versus cat paws and pointed claws) the screen is tiny and not sized to touch each and every little control such as web buttons to exit pop-up ad's, back button on the web toolbar and other tiny controls.  I'm thinking a stylus would be a good thing for touch control but also watch my wife zing around on her mini iPad without any issues. I'm hoping to not buy any accessories such as stylus, mouse, keyboard, etc... it's a tablet.\n\nBattery life is good with constant use and last me 8 plus hours.  Watching movies takes more power and discharges faster but I usually am online with a movie and other activities for maximum 4 hours straight so practically this will last two days per charge for me.\n\nFour star reasons = Functionality with tiny controls such as web buttons to exit pop-up ad's, back button on the web toolbar and other tiny controls, plus the technical issue of screen brightness randomly changing."}

An SD card is almost a must for this version. I download audio, video and ebooks quite often hence the need for extra space.\n\nA lot of people commented on hardware quality, wifi issues, etc..I have yet to experience any.

So I try to do everything from the familiar Desktop mode. This limits my frustration, since I already know how that works. I upgraded to Office 365 pro, mostly for Microsoft Access.\n\nI have started to explore the Apps. I have only looked at free ones. I try a few different ones and choose which I like the best and uninstall the rest.\n\nI need to uninstall a bunch of other stuff, because the OS(C)drive is close to 80% full. I installed a 4 gig chip and directed all downloads to that.\n\nBattery Life - I keep my toy plugged in all the time. However, I ran a test. Unplugged, set to sleep mode, woke up half our later, used multiple apps for 2 hours during a meeting, put back to sleep, drove home and plugged it in half hour later. Battery down only to 75%. If I am going to use it for an 8 hour day I would definitely keep it plugged into my backup battery, and then I would not worry.\n\nI put the Task Manager on both the Start and Task Bar. Otherwise the Apps stay open. With the mouse I can go up to the top of any open App and a close X does show up.\n\nFor the most part this has completely replaced my laptop, except for the memory issues.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I own 4 tablets (a 10\" Android, a 7\" Android, a Surface RT, and the Dell Venue 8 Pro) and the DV8P is by far my favorite. I never really fell in love with my Android tablets despite being an avid Android phone fanboy. And while the Surface RT really changed my opinion on Windows 8's user interface, the requirement to use Internet Explorer and lack of non-Microsoft Store programs made it pretty limited in terms of getting real work done.\n\nThe DV8P fits a really awesome niche for me. I wanted a highly portable device with which I could take written notes - something bigger than my Note 3 but not huge. There are a few 10\" Windows and Android tablets out there that fit that description but 8\" is really a sweet spot between my 5.7\" Note and my 15\" ultrabook. 10\" tablets are unwieldy enough to make me reach for my laptop and 7\" tablets don't offer a ton more space than my phone. So the 8\" screen really hit the mark.\n\nI made sure to purchase the active stylus and it works decently once you get over its learning curve. OneNote is nice but its metro mode is pretty limited. The desktop mode version has significantly more features and is a lot more intuitive (if you're familiar with how MS likes to layout its Office programs).\n\nBattery life and screen quality are both really solid. I get about a day and a half to two days out of the battery with pretty regular use.\n\nI highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a Windows 8 tablet for note taking, light excel work, or playing old PC games on the go (just add a bluetooth mouse)."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I have to say that I'm really surprised about how seamlessly this tablet functions. I'm a traditional Apple guy, and have always looked down on Windows. Using this tablet has been a real eye opener for me. The operating system is fluid. The CPU is quick. Navigating is a breeze. The display is bright, clear, and colorful. Every base is covered. The most amazing aspect of this tablet is the fact that it contains a complete version of Windows 8.1, and it is absolutely functional. The idea of having a complete OS within a tablet is breathtaking. This tablet is as close to perfect as I could ever imagine. Less expensive than an iPad with broader features, and expandable storage. An absolute no brainer indeed. I purchased the 64 GB version so as to have more breathing room in the storage department - especially when it comes to downloading Microsoft apps. I also purchased the latest Dell stylus which really helps with the touchscreen, especially when using Windows 8.1 desktop."}

I spoke to Amazon about this through Live Chat and they advised that I should contact DELL directly as the product warranty was with them. I explained to Amazon that I was an international customer and that this product was not available in my region, to which I was told the item comes with an international warranty so DELL will still support the product.\n\nI contacted DELL who refused to help and informed me that as the item was not available in my region, they would be unable to source the parts required to fix the faulty power button. Great. I returned to Amazon Live Chat 2 weeks later after continuously trying to get DELL to help to no avail. Amazon now informed me that the returns window had passed and there was nothing they could do to help! Brilliant service, Amazon. Thank you very much. After much to and fro I was offered a minimal $30 to cover the cost of \"repair\" of an item that I cannot get repaired.\n\nAll in all, I am very frustrated with this item because of the fault and with Amazon's service but have given the DELL Venue Pro 8 an overall rating of 4/5 as it really is a great tablet - I just wish mine wasn't faulty!"}

While touch sensitive for \"tablet\" applications, I use it with  a Bluetooth keyboard a Dell stylus for Office and similar pc programs.  It is too small to be a pc replacement.\n\nUpdate:  There are two  major problems with this machine.  The first is that all communications and charging are through the mini-USB port which is not sturdy.

They wanted to remove the MS Office and charge approximately $270, without providing any additional warranty, essentially the cost of a replacement machine.\n\nI bought a replacement machined and installed the same software.  The screen froze.

There's still so much about it I haven't explored, so I can't compare/recommend TOO much, since it's my first tablet, windows 8, etc.  Too many considerations as to why I chose this one.\n\nSuffice it to say that it arrived in very good condition and is performing well.  (I think there are two cameras--still haven't tested one of them--hope it works since it's probably too late to return--but whichever one takes video works well.  Still learning about apps, haven't used Skype.  Did download MS Office, which will be nice if I ever need it, though the desktop mode is rather small to work on the Word documents I've tried without the magnifier on, and then its not roomy enough to work very comfortably.  May get a monitor if I can deal with the Miracast/HDMI controversy.\n\nIt would be good if there were available a more detailed \"Getting Started\" instructions or just a basic introductory manual.\n\nI had never used a touchscreen, and when I was setting things up, following the instructions, I accidentally double-tapped, I think--the \"Next Screen\" or \"ACCEPT\" page--and bypassed a page, not know what it was, and there was no \"back\" button.  I panicked, and had to look up on my Chromebook how to handle that.  It wasn't too bad, but not everyone knows where to turn for help.  This might be the first/only computer for some purchasers, who might appreciate a \"DO THIS FIRST\" step-by-step introductory manual.  Even just \"check a box\" when ordering that asks, \"Is this your first computer? Would you require detailed printed manual?\" and could charge extra $$ for it.\n\nJust a suggestion for such a complicated piece of technology being purchased by people of various levels of experience with computers.\n\nOh yes.  DO GET AN OTG (ON THE GO) CABLE!  This way, you can connect it to regular USB devices. They are cheap, a few bucks.\n\nOne of these reviewers thought you can't stream Amazon video on the DV8P.  You CAN, you just have to download the player (\"Starlight\",I think?) and watch it on DESKTOP MODE.  (It's good and clear,but more steps to FULL SIZE screen and there's no 10-second rewind, which I miss.)\n\nAlso, there's also an issue about not being usable while charging.  I have let the battery run out but could use it about 5? minutes after plugging in.  But maybe I'm not supposed to.  Or maybe it recharges really fast, I don't know.  Or maybe I'm imagining that 5 minutes, because I have access to another computer.  However, I understand that could be a problem for some."}

I was very pleased with the device but struggled to do productive tasks like typing word documents on it and even bought a fifteen dollar app that was crash happy and didn't transfer over to a PC seamlessly, even though it advertised itself in that way. I did some research and set out to find a tablet that i could use like a portable laptop for my freshman year of college. I went straight to the top of the line model, the surface pro 3 and the ipad air and was very pleased with both of those but found it impractical to spend so much money on a tablet when I'm about to have to shell out hundreds on textbooks. I then started looking at other options and came across the dell Venue 11 pro with windows 8.1 and even got to use it at an office max and was very impressed by the power found in the intel powered portable tablet, but again, a hefty price tag. So this is how i came across the brilliant, compact, and very reasonably priced tablet, the dell venue 8 pro. It small but not too small, it fits perfectly in one hand and i can type on it very easily. It is very powerful and can run multiple applications as well as use the full extent of windows 8.1 at its disposal. The microsoft office suite is definitely a gigantic plus (and money saver) and they work seamlessly and are very nice to use with a blue tooth keyboard. This tablet has served me very well and i would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a lightweight alternative to a laptop/ device to use on a college campus"}

I record using the built in microphone with fine audio results, plug in a flash drive and move the file to it, and voila! I'm using the sound program Audacity, and the Venue 8 Pro handles that just fine. I use Office to keep track of my clients and related information. It came with a bunch of aps that I don't need that I just took off. The touch navigation is pretty intuitive. I haven't had any real problems with it after a month or so of using it. As far as I can tell, it has all the power and brains to do everything my laptop does. I do recommend getting the mouse and external keyboard if you want to do any real work on it. The screen keyboard takes up more than half the screen and obscures the work you're doing.  If you get the mouse, you don't need the stylus. I have both, and don't even know where the stylus is. It will be my companion for all travel. Oh and it has a camera that flips takes from either side. Really a nice tool."}

The hardware is solid, the screen crisp and clear. Even the battery seems to last much longer then I expect a full Windows PC to. I am really a fan of the iPad, I have 3. I just bought this because it seems like a great value, and I wanted to see for myself the new UI on Windows. My conclusion is that this is a very underrated OS/UI, and I can't imagine why this hardware does not sell out at this cost. A full PC for $199 still seems like Dell has got to be loosing $$ on everyone sold. Highly recommended."}

Got a fintie case and keyboard with it too, has helped significantly.\nI have taken many notes on this thing, while the keyboard with the case is much smaller, after getting used to it I can use it easily.\nGreat for school work, in my opinion. Have not yet written a paper on it, however.\nI do not use photoshop or do any games on it or anything like that really. Mostly use it for basic things: office 13, youtube, email, social media, research, music, Bible, reading, simple things like that.\n\nI used an ASUS T100 prior to this one, with the keyboard being attachable it actually got hard for the tablet to register when it was hooked up to the keyboard. With the blue tooth it has made the tablet a lot easier to connect.\n\nBattery life is fairly good. I cannot recall exactly how long it takes for it to die when fully charged, but from my understanding I believe it is roughly 8 hours. It seems to have charged pretty quick for me too.\n\nComfortable, portable, and has certainly met my expectations."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "5-22-15\n\nAll this time later...still trying to turn this endless problem-factory into a working tablet. The overnight battery drain problem was eventually solved by removing the SDHC card- thanks to some other poor suffering owner on a forum bothering to figure it out and let us know. No advice from Dell, no change, no fixes for anything: no hope. So one of the main reasons for buying this particular tablet will never be possible to use, no matter what. And the fast draining battery while in use has not been fixed. Will never be fixed, apparently.\n\nOf all the electronics I have ever purchased, this is the one that has caused, and is still causing- the most grief. First of all, when\nsomething doesn't work at all, I have no trouble with it. Send it back, end of story. THIS disgusting tablet has always partly worked, and still partly works- which is the worst possible situation. One infuriated reviewer expressed extreme annoyance over paying a lot of money for the horror of being a beta tester for Dell- and that is exactly my own experience. What kind of company releases a tablet with as many unsolvable issues as this one? This is such an outrageously bug-ridden Always Promising/Never Delivering experience that I will never buy anything from Dell again. And that is a serious promise.  Normally I would never permanently reject an entire company because of a single terrible experience. But the extreme difference between the potential of the Dell Venue 8 Pro and the actual insanity of day-to-day life with it has gotten under my skin in a way no other gadget ever has before.\n\nI'm not going to bother explaining the gory details because I have the same unsolvable issues as everyone else who got one of the giant batch of lemons... but kept on trying to make lemonade. I'd enjoy stomping it to smithereens, but it isn't the poor tablet's fault that the makers of this utterly unfinished object did the world's worst job of testing it before unleashing it on unsuspecting buyers. The unpopular Blackberry Playbook I bought on sale for 100$ still works flawlessly years later. I love it, and still use it every day. My old first-gen Nexus 7 also still works perfectly well too, and even keeps a surprisingly decent battery life after all this time. But Dell can't make a tablet that works at all for a very large percentage of buyers, let alone holds up over time?\n\nThe Dell Venue 8 Pro on the other hand, which seemed to offer so much more, has never risen above perpetual life support for many of us. Only the useless promises for fixes lured me into keeping it in the first place. So Dell owes the great number of owners of these fantastically defective devices more than an apology. Dell owes us compensation. Of course I know we will never get it. But nevertheless, they owe it. And since people I know often ask for my opinion on which electronics to buy, I'll also advise them not to purchase anything from Dell ever again. Releasing this mess was tantamount to a criminal offense against average consumers.\n\nMy Dell Venue 8 Pro arrived- new in the box- with serious sleep, shut down, battery drain, and WiFi issues. Uh oh.\nYet instead of sending it back instantly, as any sane person would do, I took all these problems as \"an interesting challenge\".  (Don't say it- I know.)\nBut I liked this device very much, theoretically. So I gave it all I've got in the way of do-it-yourself repair for a brand new faulty tablet.\nI read through every pertinent entry, in every related forum I could find. This took a very very long time.\n\nBecause no one wants to call tech support, do they?\nNo one wants to wait for an hour to speak to a fellow human forced to robotically repeat useless forms of \"help\".\nBut when nothing helped after all that work, I steeled myself and made the dreaded Dell Tech Support call.\nAnd the fellow I talked to was very nice, helpful and knowledgeable. He had it up and running after going over it thoroughly and making several changes.\nAfterwards, I felt hopeful again- especially when it booted right up, and shut down without draining the battery- and the WiFi even worked. Great progress, no?\nNO. Within two days, the WiFi once again quit working.\n\nThis was quite discouraging, and all the time I was spending fiddling with this defective device was becoming expensive.\nAfter a few days of trying again with yet more suggested fixes, I gave up again and after doing a full factory restore- called Dell Tech Support.\nAgain, I spoke with a very intelligent and personable human. And again, I felt very hopeful afterward.\nAnd again, everything seemed to be working very well....for a couple of days. And again, the same WiFi problem returned.\nI don't like being forced to live inside a bad cartoon, but here I am. Because I am returning this item....and will be sent a replacement.\nI can hardly wait.\nI'm sure it will be \"an interesting challenge\".\n\n***\n\nReplacement review:  After several months, I haven't had all of the original list of problems with the replacement. It hasn't been any kind of interesting challenge at all, thank goodness. And I like it. Many of the features I wanted it for do work very well. Read all the 4 and 5 star reviews for details on why many people find this device useful, and even irreplaceable. So why am I only giving it 3 stars even now, when it works more or less as advertised and is a very clever little computer? Because one of the main selling points to me was the pen. I use a Wacom tablet daily in my work and have grown to like pens over keyboards and mice by quite a bit. When I bought this Dell tablet I knew very well that the pen function was originally very faulty. But by the time I bought it, many people were saying that the pen function had been fixed. It hasn't been fixed very well however. The pen is still at heart something of a hysterical maniac, skipping and jumping and wriggling around as if possessed. I can sort of use it, but I still can't use it to take easily legible notes, which is what I wanted it for. I bought this device rather than a Galaxy Note because it had every feature I wanted and more, including great sound. My mistake was to assume that sooner or later Dell would find a way to make the pen work well. Why wouldn't they? They have a lot invested in it, and in the many complaints about it. I had faith, and I am patient. But so far, nothing has changed. I can take notes if I don't mind that the result looks like a small child has been practicing forming letters. But I do mind. This level of partial legibility is no use to me.\n\nThe way I look at it though, I bought this knowing the hoped-for pen function might never be of sound mind, so I am not returning it. One might fairly say I deliberately bought a faulty gadget- because I did.\nThe other thing worth mentioning is that in sleep mode, my Dell Venue 8 Pro holds a charge very well overnight and for the next day too. But after that, it loses a charge very quickly and must be left to recharge for many hours. So I have to keep it topped off. This isn't a problem but just the way it is. And everything else works very well.\n\nDec. 1, 2015:  Final Autopsy Report:\nThe infamous micro-USB charging port pins finally bent despite the most careful handling.  I knew about this faulty part before I even risked buying the device, because kind consumers made it known. So I made it a point, every single time, to insert and pull out this terrifying connection with extremes of caution. Nevertheless, there was no such thing in the end as being careful enough. Therefore, overall, I had very few months of trouble-free use from this device. It was definitely a bad purchase. I liked it a lot during those weeks when nothing went wrong. But it cost far too much money relative to the small amount of time I had enjoying it.\n\nSince Dell already knew about this poorly-designed part and never offered a reasonably fair way of replacing it, I have decided to refuse to buy anything from Dell ever again. I know, I know. This may sound peevish and irrational. Nevertheless, the older I get, the more I care about customer service than any particular device connected to bad customer service. From now on, I'm going to limit all electronic purchases to companies with a good record for customer service."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "This is a review for the 32GB version. For a couple of hundred dollars, you're getting a lot of computer for the money. If you don't care to read the whole review and just want to know if this can replace your laptop/netbook, absolutely it can.\n\nWhat I wanted was something portable with a long battery life to replace my laptop. My requirements were that it had 8+ hours of battery life, could be stowed in my 12\"x8\"x4\" bag, could run Scrivener, Final Draft and my older Windows games. Also it had to be fanless with a solid state drive as I'm sick of ambient computer noise. After using this for a month, it meets all of my needs and is indeed the best computer I've ever owned. I only gave this machine 4 stars, because of the minor annoyances detailed below, but that doesn't stop it from being better than every computer I've ever owned and I wish I had one of these for my college years.\n\nHard Drive Capacity:\n\nNaturally, with a 32gb flash drive, this is a major concern for anyone using this as a netbook/laptop replacement. After uninstalling all of the bloatware and installing all of the Windows updates, I am left with a little over 9gb of hard drive left. This is with Office uninstalled (since I have no use for it) and with the recovery partition intact (because I like to do periodic reinstalls and the recovery drive is convenient for that). If you removed the recovery partition, I've read you can gain another 5gb, but I honestly don't think it's necessary. Unless the Windows install itself gets bloated, there just isn't much that you can run on here that will take a ton of space. It's not a gaming machine. You're probably not going to be editing movies on here. Most games and apps in the Windows Store are fairly lightweight. Office is probably the most bloated software you'd run on this machine and there's ample space for that. All of your media can live on a micro sd card and this will support one up to 128gb. If you get a cheap OTG cable, you can fill up your flash drives as well. You can't run an external hard drive on that port, unless it has an external source of power, however, so if you want to use one of those with this machine, you need to find an externally powered USB hub. And if you don't want to worry about hard drive space so much, the 64gb version should give you plenty of room. I'm OCD with my files and media anyway, so it doesn't bother me to constantly keep things tidy.\n\nBattery:\n\nDo not install the USB to LAN driver in the optional driver updates. I'm not 100% certain, but I think that driver is the cause of most people's trouble with the battery only charging to 85% or so and stopping. My first install with all the updates gave me that problem, but when I did a factory reset and on a hunch left that driver update out of it, I didn't encounter that issue again, though it could just be anecdotal.\n\nAs far as the battery life goes, I can't compare it to other tablets of the same class, as all of my experience before this has been from power hungry laptops, but I must say I'm impressed. On all of my laptops I'm conditioned to be trying to find a power outlet at 40%, which happens after an hour or so of use. With this tablet, when I get to 40% I still have another 3 hours to go. The 8ish hours of battery time is pretty close to the truth of normal use (e.g. word processing, web browsing, etc.), which was a pleasant surprise, as I've had netbooks before that advertised far longer times than they delivered in terms of battery life. If you play 3d games on it, or do anything that requires a bit of heavier processing and screen power, you'll run the battery down faster and will be looking at closer to 5 hours, but that's not all that surprising. I must say it's really nice to have a computer that doesn't need to be tethered to the wall all day.\n\nWhen the battery does run out, it takes about 3-4 hours to recharge completely. I wish they included a longer USB cable (the supplied one is only 3'), to make it easier to keep working while it charges, but that's easily remedied for a few bucks.\n\nScreen:\n\nThis is a tiny screen to use in a desktop environment, so if you're far sighted, this might not be the machine for you. The 1280x800 max resolution is a complaint some folks have, but on an 8\" screen, I really can't see the benefit of having a higher resolution.\nThe touch controls on this screen are very responsive, and sometimes a little too responsive as when I'm scrolling down a web page, sometimes I'll inadvertently zoom in. There isn't much delay switching between landscape and portrait views. I don't have a wireless TV, so I haven't yet been able to try out the Miracast support. I'll update this review when I get a new TV.\n\nMore to the OS than to the touch screen, though both play equal parts is the writing to text recognition. When using your finger it is actually pretty good at guessing what you wrote. The last sentence was written with only one error and I owe that to my man hands. I don't have a stylus, but I bet there'd be no errors if I used one. Overall, touch typing is still faster, as there's a delay while it tries to decipher your scratchings.\n\nWindows 8.1 OS:\n\nLegacy Windows Programs are the reason you get a Windows 8.1 computer over RT or Android/Apple anything. Anything you can get to run on XP, Vista or Windows 7, you'll get to run on here (within the hardware's limitations, obviously). When you go into the Desktop mode, it's all familiar and with a bluetooth keyboard and mouse, it's more or less a total desktop environment. The start menu isn't the same as you're used to, because it's been replaced with the Metro Start screen, but once you get the hang of it, it's all very intuitive and it's seemless switching between the two. There are options for booting straight to the desktop, as well as some 3rd party programs to replace the start menu with something more familiar, but in my opinion, some of the Metro apps are very handy and switching between modes is easy enough that it's like switching between workspaces on Macintosh. The desktop becomes the place to work without distractions and the Metro start screen becomes the place to play. I really like how you can just swipe from left to right to switch between running programs. It's convenient to keep IE11 or Mail open in Metro and just swipe over to check once in a while and then swipe right back to the desktop and get back to work.\n\nThere are some really good apps for Metro, some of the Bing ones are really good, but as many have complained, there aren't a lot of great ones to choose from. But, I've run into issues like that with Android, where there are only a handful of stellar apps, and a hundred thousand of garbage. The beauty of 8.1 though is you can always fall back on the functionality of a desktop OS if you can't find a Metro app to do a particular job. Metro is so intuitive though that it's only going to take a handful of developers to fill some of the gaps to make it competitive with IOS in the app department. It really is a joy to use, and what I like best about it is you never feel locked into a particular ecosystem. My only complaint to Microsoft is hindering the development of competing web browsers. They should worry about selling the operating system and not Internet Explorer. Their Bing apps (which are quite well done) can do more for their Browser revenue than their crippled web browser can, but this isn't the place for that rant. Sometimes, when using the Metro IE11, it gets 'stuck' and to get it unstuck, I have to rotate the screen. So far, IE11 is the only app that I've had this problem with, so it might be just a quirk of that and not of the Venue 8 Pro.\n\nPorts:\n\nAnother limitation to this tablet that might be a deal breaker for some folks is the fact that there's only one Micro USB port and it's the same port used for charging. This doesn't bother me so much as it's a tablet and having a ton of peripherals attached to your tablet defeats the purpose, but there are times when the battery starts to get low and you might be transferring files to a USB stick and need to stop to recharge. A separate charging port would be a welcome feature. Also, because of the single port, this tablet cannot run USB devices that use USB power to work, like external hard drives or optical drives. So, if you plan to use any of those devices you need to get a powered USB hub or they themselves need to have their own power source.\n\nCameras:\n\nI really don't use either the front or rear camera on this tablet as I use my cell phone's camera more, but the cameras on here are adequate for a convenience camera. I feel the same about computer cameras as I do about cell phone cameras, if you're trying to get the best pictures, you're using the wrong tools. Buy a good camera if you want good pictures.\n\nWhat I really like is the Metro Photos app as it makes touching up pictures and fixing light balance and color correcting a snap. I've been using it for all of my eBay pictures. The Adobe app is pretty popular, but I haven't even tried it, because this one does all I need it to.\n\nWi-Fi / Bluetooth:\n\nThis is pretty good at finding a signal. My router is in the basement and when I'm on my front porch, my cellphone struggles to find a bar, where this tablet will find 2 bars.\n\nThe Bluetooth has found and paired seamlessly with all of my peripherals: keyboard, mouse and speakers.\n\nSound:\n\nIt's a tiny speaker, but it's as good as you can expect for its size. Obviously at higher volumes you get distorted, tinny noise without much bass, but that's what the bluetooth speakers are for when you want to use this as a multimedia device. I picked up a cheap receiver that I hooked up to my stereo and that fits the bill nicely. Otherwise, there's a speaker/headphones jack, but when a bluetooth receiver is under ten bucks, there's really no reason not to go wireless.\n\nPortability:\n\nThis is light and easy to carry around. With a lightweight cover/stand, it's like carrying around a Moleskine Notebook in size. With a light case, it weighs just over a pound. It's very easy to hold in one hand. I thought it might be too small before I bought it, but after using it exclusively for all of my computer needs for a month, it really is the perfect sized device, in my opinion, to balance convenience and function.\n\nIt boots up in seconds, even when cold booting, so it's great to have within reach when you need to quickly look something up and being a full OS and larger screen, it's more convenient than a cell phone in most cases. The small footprint means it's a machine that stays out of the way too, when you need it to, but don't necessarily want to put it away. It goes without saying that if you take it with you in public, keep close tabs on it as it's all the more likely to walk away on you.\n\nQuirks and Cons:\n\nThe way the screen dims to save battery power isn't the smoothest, so if a shadow passes over the sensor, a couple seconds later the screen will dim and then it takes a couple more seconds for it to undim.\n\nWhen switching out of Airplane mode, the Wi-Fi doesn't always restart and can only be fixed by disabling and enabling the driver in Device Manager.\n\nNo Swipe on the on screen keyboard.\n\nThe Dell software is garbage and should be uninstalled. All firmware and driver updates should be done individually.\n\nThat about sums up my thoughts on this computer. It's only been a month, but I'm in love with it already. I'll update this review if I come across any other pros or cons I think potential buyers should know about.\n\nEDIT: 8/28/2014\n\nAbout a week ago, I ran into the problem where I couldn't get the tablet to wake up from sleep mode. I had to plug it in to the charger and hold the power button until it rebooted. I did some research and some folks have had the same issues. I do not think this is a problem with the tablet itself, however, and more a symptom of Windows 8.1's poor handling of sleep mode (I've never had a Windows computer that didn't have problems with sleep mode). So, my solution, which may not be a solution to others, was to disable sleep mode altogether. I just have the display turn off after idle time instead of sleep and when I'm not using it, I just shut it down completely. The tablet boots up so fast from a cold boot that it really isn't much different than waking it up from sleep, except, obviously, your programs won't be already running when you come back. Just thought I'd mention it as something like this might be a deal breaker for some."}

I discovered it when I clicked the Drivers and Download button in My Dell.  (One would think that you shouldn't have to do that after all of the other checks My Dell does and Update Driver should have picked it up, as well.  Oh, you need to run My Dell and the associated IE pages from the desktop.  They won't work if you run them from the Metro interface.)  After sorting out the two recommended downloads that weren't for my Venue 8 Pro, I downloaded and installed the new driver.  Performance improved, dramatically! It is now a useful device and with it's small size I use it often.  I'd give it 5 stars except for all of the support issues.\n\nOriginal review....\n\nAgainst my better judgement (I've had problems with Dell products and poor support before), I bought this device because it was the only one that met my needs for the price I wanted to pay and good reviews.  I guess I'm \"insane\" because I hoped for a different outcome. While it is generally a good unit, the wireless performance is absolutely terrible.  I did lots of googling and found this is a common problem.  I did all the usual things, install updates; uninstall and reinstall the wireless device, install Windows updates, uninstall Windows updates, etc.  I didn't call Dell Tech Support because I have NEVER had a good experience with them and I refuse to waste hours of my time talking to someone in India who knows less about the problem than I do.  Sad to say, my patience ran out 1 day after the return window closed.  So I will have to suffer until Dell finally figures out how to make this thing perform with a wireless connection."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "This tablet it awesome! It runs most anything my laptop can but it smaller and more lightweight making it easier for me to transport.\n\nThe only downside I have is the screen is way too sensitive and I can't seem to figure out any way to calibrate it. As a result, I end up double or quadruple or even more pressing a button when I only touched it once. This is far too frustating when trying to enter a password or set up an account so I now have accounts that have four S's in their name instead of one.\n\nIt is really nice that it came equipped with Microsoft Office so definately great for students (right here!).\n\nAlso the weight feature makes it even easier for students who already pack around heavy textbooks.\n\nSince it has Windows 8/8.1 you can use IE, Firefox, or Chrome as your browser, you can use Adobe reader, you can play Windows games, you can run Flash (big one for me since my classes require flash availability). The matter that I was not restricted like how an Android, Apple, or Windows RT running tablets are is why I bought this particular tablet. I don't want to have to get a Microsoft Office substitute that I can't do my homework and submit it to instructors on. Or something I can't use Adobe reader on because it doesn't support it. Or not be able to view flash objects on it since Adobe discontinued their Flash for mobile. I also never got the hang of using Android device so that pretty much puts those out of the race for me since I'm used to iOS. I also like how I can have most of everything sync with my desktop computer at home so if this dies I can just use my desktop while I wait for it to charge.\n\nI also want to point out when I ened to upgrade or want to purchase another tablet I will buy another Dell Venue. I love the way it works and the sensitivity issues I touched I have kind of gotten used to. The trick if you seriously have to chicken peck the screen, if you leave you finger on the keys for more than a second it will start double typing the characters."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I bought this and used it for a while, coming from a previous iPad 2.  I am a long time Windows user on desktop but hadn't tried it on tablet previously.  Now after using it for as long as I can stand (several months at least), I've purchased a cheapo Android tablet and I'm selling this one locally.  Here's what I didn't like:\n\n* Touch screen is buggy.  Dell has released driver updates that improve this quite a bit, but if you are a finger user you will still be frequently frustrated by how difficult it can be to get the screen to zoom or scroll when and where you want it, and forget easily using commands like cut/copy/paste or doing complex selections with fingers.\n* The screen is gorgeous, but very high resolution.  I had to strain to read text on this screen, it's very tiny.  You can generally zoom when using a web browser or many other apps, but there are some elements that don't scale, and zooming on this platform often plays hell with websites and screws up the formatting so much that they become unreadable.  I was mostly using Chrome but also tried the included IE with the same result.\n* Within a month of using the tablet, there was a Windows Update that broke power saving mode to the point where if the tablet goes to sleep it needs to be hard reset in order to bring it back to life.  This is especially annoying if you are working and walk away for 2 minutes to get coffee and find that your work is toast, which happened to me on a few occasions.  Dell was no help on this, I had to find and kill the suspect Windows Update on my own with Google.  Annoying for a new and expensive product like this.\n* Windows 8.1 feels like it requires an external keyboard and a (not included) stylus to be very useful on tablet.  Like I said, simple Windows operations like cut/paste or making selections were very difficult to do without accessories that weren't included, as cheap as they may be.\n\nSo anyway, if you are already a Win8 tablet user, this is probably great.  If you are coming from an iPad or Android tablet, this won't even feel like a tablet in comparison, IMO.\n\nI gave it two stars because the screen really is gorgeous, even if text is too small.  Viewing angle was pretty amazing on this little thing for the price."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I wanted to like this, but can't.  It's too small and because it is a computer that you interface with your fingers, the buttons, especially in the browser are too small.  Navigation is somewhat harder than it should be and Microsoft (go figure) doesn't quite have the OS right, especially when dealing with the on-screen keyboard.  The lack of a full-size USB port means you will have to buy an adapter.  The battery is weak and you MUST turn it off when done (shut down from Windows); if you let it sleep, it will be dead when you come back to use it.  I might could like this if it were a 12\" or larger display.  I would not buy this product again, but only because it's too small.  If that's okay with you, and you don't mind not having a full-size USB, it might be okay."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "This is as I feel the most honest and comprehensive review of the dell venue 8 pro running windows 8.1\n\nConsumers demand tech at a rapid pace and as such companies have implemented a Shoot now and ask questions later policy to the products they rollout. End result? Products that are initially buggy but are fixed through software updates later. The venue 8 pro does not escape this maelstrom\n\nUpon purchasing my venue 8 pro I had already understood the inherent risks in buying such a device, some were lemons, the pen input was iffy and some complained of the unit overheating during prolonged use.\n\nMy initial impressions with the V8P were spectacular. The device powered up (which is always a plus) ran me through the initial programming and after that I hit the ground running.  I will say that the unit did get unusually hot during the first few days and I did have some initial bugs but after doing some digging through windows update and dells support site this unit has come leaps and bounds.\n\nFor the tech savvy, a bios update and a firmware update did the trick and alleviated most of my initial qualms. Dell has really been proactive in making sure that these units get the support that they need so if you're weary about picking one up because of the aforementioned problems above please note that THEY CAN BE FIXED.\n\nThats not to say that the V8P doesnt still get warm/hot during certain applications. This is a small tablet with no external ventilation so the heat has to be dissipated somehow.\n\nAs the months have gone on I haven't had a single issue with this tablet. I purchased the companion dell stylus to go with it (revision A02) and after a digitizer firmware update the pen input is much, much better.\n\nIve used this tablet primarily to shoot off emails, watch videos, read pdfs and the like. I plan to further augment this tablets use into my everyday note taking companion during lectures and work.\n\nComing from the HP slate 500, an early foray into the tablet world this dell venue 8 pro has blown every expectation Ive had out of the water. The next gen quad core atom processors are snappy, robust and efficient enough to meet my demands and still offer exceptional battery life. I at one point had the tablet on and in standby in between using it periodically for 4 or 5 days without it dying.\n\nThe fact that this tablet is now hovering around 200$, comes with office 2013 and has exceptional build quality and support is reason enough to pick up one of these. I don't regret my purchase at all and all early bugs aside this is a very capable machine that I would recommend to anyone. Once you get the updates in this thing will be your workhorse.\n\nWould I run cs6 on this? No, but if you're using cs6 on a daily basis then you're probably not looking at this machine\nBut for productivity, leisure, your EVERYDAY tasks, you cant go wrong with this especially at this value. Why shell out 129$ on an 8 inch android tablet when you can get FULL windows for 70 dollars more?\nDont let the boys in Cupertino sucker you into a retina display, this machine will get the job done."}

Now it will not power on.\n\nUnfortunately, I waited too long and this is past its return date. I would've loved to be able to return the Venue 8 amd put that money towards replacing my Dell laptop which came with a bad display cable.\n\nI'm giving this 3 stars because I honestly did like the Venue 8 the few times I used it. The nearly full Windows 8 operating system and SD card slot for storage expansion make it an interesting option for a tablet."}

Was worried about purchasing refurbished but haven't experienced any issues thus far (few months in) and hardware build quality is very good. Dell Venue 8 Pro has decent battery life (8+ hrs for me), screen brightness and horsepower for general tablet gaming, word processing, e-mail, web browsing, etc. The Metro interface makes a lot more sense to me on a touch screen but is still lacking organization (folders, multiple 'home screens', etc) and applications. The windows 8.1 split screen feature is very dynamic and is one thing that works incredibly well. After purchasing this tablet and trying to leverage for business, would definitely recommend going with a 10\" tablet vs the 8\" due to screen size, resolution and better integrated keyboard options (either with cases or like the Venue 11 Pro). Additionally, the lack of an integrated cellular modem is a big drawback for me."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "My only worry was that the relatively low resolution screen would be a disappointment. Well, I was pleasantly surprised! While it is not as good as my Samsung Note 2014 (or a retina iPad), it is just fine for actual computing tasks, movies, and music videos. I got (and recommend) an OTG dongle to use a keyboard and mouse since I use Windows 8.1 in desktop mode rather than Metro.  However, metro does work and the screen is good at accepting touch inputs. I am very happy with the tablet itself. My only reservations are regarding Windows 8.1, and that's something you have to accept if you choose a Windows table. The unit is nice and slim, and I think it is very slick.\nUpdate: I forgot to add that since it is full Windows, you can use non-metro applications.  I actually use Outlook 2007 for full calendar and task functionality, although it will not work with the new notification center. However, once logged into Outlook, you get the full Outlook notifications within the application.  I also changed all of the system fonts to larger sizes for my tired old eyes.  Finally, Windows 8.1 update does not allow you to hide updates you don't want. But if you are in desktop mode, use the standard Windows Update function and you can hide updates (like the Bing bar).  A tablet this small will NEVER replace a desktop PC, but you can use it in tablet mode for media consumption and light computing, or use it in desktop mode with a USB keyboard and mouse. It rocks."}

I did look at this tablet for a little, but did not consider it much.  However, I finally came around to realize that this is better, although the screen is smaller, than the Surfaces because it runs a full Windows 8.1 (Surface RT and Surface 2 run Windows 8.1 RT, which is not a full version of Windows 8.1). I did not want to risk something on the Surface not working, such as a normal .exe that would work on my laptop because of the RT version.\n\nThis was on sale one day on the Dell website ($199- normally $249 on Dell and Amazon and upwards of $270 on Best Buy and other sites). I checked Amazon and found it was $199 here as well so I went ahead and bought it.\n\nI've had it for a week and have had no problems. I bought a case/keyboard for it (Fintie Blade X1 Dell Venue 8 Pro (Windows 8.1) Keyboard Case) as well as a micro USB to USB adapter and a USB hub. After one week, everything is working well. While my USB adapter is plugged in the tablet cannot be charging, but the battery life during constant use is 7-8 hours (with bluetooth on to use my physical keyboard battery life is 6-7 hours. Still very impressive considering most of that was internet use and video streaming).\n\nOne thing I did notice that buyers on Amazon should keep an I out for is that mine did not come with Microsoft Office 2013 (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote and Outlook) installed. My brother bought one through Dell.com and it did (they advertise it). I'm fairly confident they advertised that as well here (it doesn't appear so now, maybe they changed it), but I could download an even better edition (the above plus Access, Publisher, Lync, and more) for free from my university. Worked out well in the end for me, but just something to be aware of. EDIT: found where it is advertised. above the reviews it has the same information that is on the Dell site (looks like a screenshot almost, can't miss it). It says its under the preinstalled software. Either false advertising or mine was just missing it.\n\nA mouse is nice to get too. Sometimes I use it, sometimes I don't. Something that can easily be thrown in a backpack and used if you just can't do what you want to with the touchscreen.\n\nEDIT 2: After using this product for 8 months, it's not as great as I once wrote. If I bought this again, I'd spend the extra on a 64GB version.  The 32GB version comes with about 12GB free and, without downloading or saving anything, it slowly decreases little by little. For example, I turned it off last night at 9.3GB free and this morning its at 8.7GB.  For the first 7 months I was constantly using it with less than 1GB free and I decided to reset it to factory settings to see if that helped the space. It gave me the extra 10+GB back, but its slowly taking it away again. And moving files to a microSD card does not seem to help that much. Changed from 5 stars to 3 stars."}

I was hoping to be able do work with it but the 10 inch screen doesn't seem large enough.  I am using both the Venue 8 and the 10 inch tablets with external keyboards.  I like the Venue 8 much better.  If Microsoft could get the app developers producing usable apps for the Metro interface they could have a very useful product.\n\nThere are a lot of very detailed reviews so I will only hit a few highlights:\n\nPros:\n-Light and thin\n-Starts in about 10 seconds\n-I purchased from Dell and it came with home version of office 2013 which will serve the purpose when I want to try to get some work done.\n-It is fast for a tablet.  I notice no lag but I am not playing games.\n-It is the full version of Windows so just about any windows program will run.  It is not Win 8 Pro so it will not connect to a work domain.\n-Speaker has decent volume without distortion\n\nCons:\n-Really needs a full USB port.  Having to carry an adapter is just a pain.  I transfer a lot of files to USB drives.\n-Should allow any USB charger to work.  I tried my phone charger and tablet does not recognize it. I will also not trickle charge from a computer USB port.  To me this is a big deal.  It means I need to travel with an extra charger.  I realize that smaller charger will take longer to charge the tablet but who cares.\n-Limited Metro (sorry modern interface) apps that work with touch.  This really limits the usability of an 8 inch product.\n-Google has the dictation stuff down, Microsoft does not.  Unfortunately typing on the tablet is a challenge, it needs swype or something similar.\n\nConclusion - for the money it is not a bad product.  Dell has done a pretty good job of putting out a product.  Microsoft has to catch up in the tablet market to really make it useful."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I received this tablet from a friend a couple months ago, and have been using it mostly for watching videos and browsing the web. It's excellent at both of those tasks, and it delivers pretty good battery life, too. At medium brightness, the battery lasts for around 7 hours (and you could probably squeeze out more with Wi-Fi off).\n\nIt feels good in the hand with its textured rubberized back and solid construction.\n\nThe main complaints I have are minor annoyances and are largely software related. The most important issue I experience regularly is that the tablet does not seem to connect properly to Wi-Fi after coming out of several hours of sleep. It shows connectivity as \"Limited,\" so I have to disconnect and reconnect to the Wi-Fi network (which takes only a few seconds). Firmware and driver updates from Dell don't seem to fix the issue. The second issue is related to Windows 8, which doesn't scale text well on the small screen, especially in Desktop mode.\n\nOverall, this tablet is a quick and light machine to run full Windows 8 on, and it's a good deal at less than $250."}

This runs full Windows 8 I use it as my only computer now.  To project it to a large monitor you need to buy a mini-USB adapter, a USB display adapter, and a powered USB hub -- into which you also plug your other USB devices because this tablet only has one [mini-]USB output.\n\nThe last fact also brings us to the limitation of this desktop-replacement setup:  you can't charge the tablet and hook up other USB devices at the same time.  That is unless you buy this kickstarted docking station from Pluggable (https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/plugable/plugable-pro8-docking-station-with-charging-for-ve).\n\nIf you're still deciding, I suggest buying one of the newer/larger Venue tablets which has fixed this limitation.  Or the Surface Pro from Microsoft.  Of course if you plan to consume content only, you should go with one of the shiny/slick Android/Apple tablets."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "REVISED DOWN TO TWO STARS\n----------------------------\nRevision: The third tablet Dell sent me just died, this time out of warranty. eMMC went bad. It's too bad; when this tablet worked it was great, but after two years, it's junik. If you do get one of these, understand you need the extended warranty, as each replacement tablet Dell gives you in my experience will barely last a few months before it goes bad.\n\n-----------------------------\n\nWhen this tablet works, it's brilliant. I was able to put a 64 GB SD card in for files, leaving enough room on the native storage of the device for VS Express 2013 and Microsoft Office. The Bay Trail chip is zippy and combined with a UD-3900 docking station, have been able to use it as a light developers workstation when necessary, as well as a handheld entertainment tablet.\n\nUnfortunately, in the last 9 months, the tablet has fried twice, and I've had to send it back to Dell. It's an annoying process where they send you a return box (usually missing the packing items they say should be in there, you then ship it back to Dell, and maybe a week later, you get your tablet back).\n\nHere's the killer. Because the 32 GB of memory is burnt onto the motherboard, when your tablet fries for any reason, they just swap in another motherboard, and you lose all your data. Even if the MMC storage itself is fine, Dell makes no effort to retrieve your data for you. I use OneDrive for all of my important files, but still, if you plan to install a bunch of desktop applications on it, it is a REAL PAIN to have to re-install them every four months when your tablet stops working and needs to be sent back. I've talked to Dell over Twitter about this, and frankly, they don't seem to gather the level of inconvenience it is.\n\nIn short, I'd love to recommend this tablet, but can't. It's been my little buddy, but when I've needed it to work the most, it konks out, and then I need to wait over a week to get it back, and then spend valuable time re-installing everything."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "Could have been a contender, but it's a Dell.. Hardware is okay so far, but I don't expect that to last - I put three Dell Venues (one Android and two Windows) into service. The Android, thanks to a dell update and a subsequent fix, is totally bricked and Dell is providing no support whatsoever in terms of repairing or replacing. (I've already filed a BBB complaint and, if not resolved to my satisfaction, will file an arbitration.) The Windows Venue, a Venue 11 Pro is already displaying disturbing messages like \"Network adapter not found\" and \"Battery not found\".\n\nThe Dell Venue 8 Pro implementation of Windows 8.1 is surprisingly good, but the display is not adequate for those with anything less than perfect vision. Adjusting the display to compensate for \"normal\" readability for an older person creates new operational problems, especially with windows that don't dynamically resize.\n\nI applied for a refund, but Dell did what Dell does - it simply ignored my inquiry, apparently thinking that I am just another sucker who will not enforce their legal rights.\n\nDell has a long history of abusing customers. In 2005, Jeff Jarvis wrote a blog post called \"Dell Hell\", recounting his struggle to get a new - and not surprisingly defective - laptop repaired..This was before the word \"viral\" was applied, but Jarvis's \"Dell Hell\" went viral. Michael Dell himself apologized to Jarvis two years later with a \"We made a mistake\" admission.\n\nIn 2007 I vowed never to buy Dell again because of deteriorating product quality and non-existent Customer and Technical support. I saw glowing magazine and blog reviews of the Venues and Dell had a sale, so I weakened,'\n\nMy mistake.\n\nBefore you buy any Dell, look at the Dell Product Support Forums for the Dell product you are considering. Reviewing the dozens, hundreds or thousands of unresolved complaints and the lack of resolution should help persuade you to never buy Dell. I wish I had followed my own advice on this one: the Dell Venue product forums are overflowing with complaints - and as you read, you're surely notice that few them are resolved by Dell.\n\nQuite possibly, if some other company, one that respected its customers and wanted a good reputation, had created the Venue 8 Pro, it might have been useful. But coming from Dell, it is laden with problems and when, inevitably, you encounter one or more, you'll learn that Dell customer and technical support is essentially non-existent.\n\nSave yourself from grief, disappointment and misery and NEVER buy Dell.\n\nJerry"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "What can I say I just love this little tablet. At first I was a bit hesitant that you could actually run Windows 8.1 on this small of a device but it turns out it works excellent. Even using old desktop apps works ok.\nThe Dell has the Windows/start button on the top side, which is a bit strange and made using in the beginning a bit difficult but having used it for a bit I realized it was super easy to swipe from the side and click the onscreen start instead. Now I actually think I prefer not having a Windows button on the front of the device because you do not risk pressing it by mistake.\nI got the digitizer pen for note taking and it was a big letdown but a while ago Dell sent me a new one out of the blue since apparently they discovered issues with the original ones. With the new digitizer pen it works great for note taking and for navigating Windows when you use desktop apps. Kudos to Dell for sending a new pen without me having to do anything.\nI have to admit that I have had to upgrade the firmware and drivers a bunch of times to get it working perfectly but even out if the box it was ok. The only real issues I have run into is the sd card sometimes not being recognized after the device has been sleeping and the screen not turning on properly after going to sleep (device is on but you can't see anything). These things have happened only a couple of times, the sd card more than a couple but still within reason, so it doesn't deduct from the score.\nBattery life is usually great, so much so that I never think of charging it. There the occasional sudden battery drop when it is asleep where it seems an app has kept it running when you might have thought it was actually sleeping. Also not frequent but it happens, luckily it charges relatively quickly."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I am gonna start off and say that the Dell Venue 8 Pro is probably the most portable and most functional tablet computer I have ever owned and at the price I got it, it is practically unbeatable spec wise.  With the full windows 8.1 OS, my use for this is practically limitless and its portable enough I can hold it in its keyboard case in one hand with ease.  Without a case or with a slim case the tablet is light and easy to grip the back is non slip and you don't have the feeling that its just going to slide out of your hands.  I bought this to replace my over sized ASUS laptop which was just awkward to carry and required a large computer bag to transport and boy this puts it to shame in terms of portability and ease of use.\n\n  First thing I do when I take the tablet out of the box is apply a screen protector (boy was that a pain...but that's another review), I was not about to trust the scratch resistance and strength of glass which for the price of the tablet is probably not as strong as its $500+ dollar counterparts.  Then because its a windows computer, after setting up my user profile I started the first round of major updates, the second, and finally a few less important ones. Then I went into the my dell application and ran system check to verify everything was checking OK with windows, after all the tests passed I went to the dell update page to update device drivers.  This is the part that most people don't seem to understand fully, this is not your average tablet, its not an android.  You have to update it and maintenance windows constantly, that's the cost of having the convenience and functionality of windows (some people will disagree with me on that part).  I installed the latest WiFi drivers, updated the dell software, and updated the bios to A08 (originally A04).  The my dell application is very useful with its own checkup  (cpu, ram, emmc, battery, etc), link to drivers, backup manger, and links to windows settings to help the user better set the look and feel that works best for them.\n\n  Now for use, I recommend using IE11 (i know) as your primary web browser because it has the the windows 8 touch interface, it is the easiest to use on the touch screen unless you are going to be using a mouse or stylus more.  The quad core atom processor inside provides more power than you would expect from a 200 dollar tablet, at 1.8 ghz. It is also a true quad core, not a dual core with multi threading. The 2 gb of ddr3 memory is enough for multitasking and windows 8 being much less demanding than win7 is plenty for office work and web browsing. Opening applications on this is quick and and there is enough free ram that can be used to open multiple applications simultaneously, even running the split screen I didn't experience any lag. I can have 10 tabs open in IE and quickly swap applications and it remains fluid. Now when it runs clocked at 1.8 ghz for an extended period of time you will notice one corner of the device start to get pretty warm (being fanless) but it is able to keep its temperature within a reasonable level. Gaming on this tablet will probably be limited to light flash games and low demand games off the app store or steam but I didn't get it for gaming.\n\nNow for a con, I'm sure everyone knows this and probably knows when ordering but when you receive the tablet, with the OS, updates, and office you are left with only 10-11 gigs of free space.  Most (non app store) applications you install will need to be manually pointed to the micro SD for installation and storage.  I bought a sandisk extreme plus micro SDHC with an 80 mb/sec read/write so that the tablet will be able to more quickly load applications.  Link below.  Another con is the overly erratic auto brightness adjustments, I had to disable that (I'll get a desktop widget or icon to quickly adjust the brightness manually).  They could have picked a better location for the windows button too rather than at the top of the device but I'll get used to it.  The touch screen at times can be touchy and a few times it has registered one touch as two.\n\n  The battery has a decent amount of stamina, probably average for a tablet this size, while just browsing the web and general use of the tablet. Charging it on the other hand is very very slow, probably takes a few hours to go from 20% to 90%.  I have noticed some battery drain because sometimes the audio driver prevents the tablet from going into standby, muting it fixes this, hopefully they have a patch soon.  The dual a/b micro usb port too feels very fragile, I am terrified because the latches on the micro usb connectors are all WAY too tight. I am afraid I will accidentally break the port, pins or the little plastic piece holding the pins, even though its inconvenient, verify that you are connecting it properly and do not yank the cable out of the device.  Also, there's only one port so you cant charge and use a usb peripheral unless you buy a special expensive adapter, link below.  Also the port only supports usb OTG (on the go) cables.\n\n  I highly recommend buying a case for this tablet, it does not boast being drop or shock proof, it may survive a few on its own but not many, also its less than 200 dollars.  The tablet itself feels sturdy in your hand and its light weight design makes it comfortable to hold. For a case I bought the Finite Keyboard Case with the magnetic Bluetooth keyboard, opened up this tablet looks like a miniature laptop that's more difficult to use in the lap but doable and its up to 60% smaller than a full sized laptop. All in all, the Dell Venue 8 Pro is an all around fully functional Windows 8 tablet PC and at its low price their are few that can compete with its specs.\n\n  This is directed at Amazon, I am slightly frustrated that I bought this when it went on sale for $230 only to discover that the day I receive it (2 days later) the price dropped to $199.\n\nUPDATE (8/2/2014):\nI have been using the tablet for about a week now, still getting used to the size of the UI and the tiny keyboard that came with the case. Currently trying to figure out a battery leak that occurs during standby, its not a hardware issue with the tablet I just hope dell releases a patch for it so I do end up doing all the work. I have not broken the USB port yet, thankfully, I figure as long as I'm careful and don't try to force it in the wrong way I shouldn't have anything to worry about. If you feel like you may have issues plugging it in properly, mark the side that faces the screen with whiteout so you see it when plugging it in.  The micro USB port is rated for 10,000 disconnects and reconnects and I realized that my kindle fire has the same port (and I used to plug and unplug that like 3 times a day). The port is kind of tight still, I hope it loosens up with use.\n\nPros:\n*8\" Capacitive 10 point touch screen\n*Functionality of windows 8\n*quad core intel atom processor w/ 1.8 ghz boost\n*Bluetooth 4.0 for multiple peripheral connectivity\n*lightweight\n*long lasting battery\n*front and back facing cameras\n*Microsoft Office Home and Student 2013 included\n\nCons:  (most of these can be ignored for the price)\n*Inconvenient windows button location\n*Still some bugs to work out\n*Fragile and tight micro usb port\n*charging speed\n*only 1280 x 800 res display\n*after the OS, office and updates only 10 gigs of storage space remain\n\nDevice Specs:\n*Dell Venue 8 Pro\n*Dim - 8.5 x 5.1 x 0.35 inches (216 x 130 x 9 mm)\n*Windows 8.1 32 bit\n*Intel Atom quad core CPU w/ 1.8 ghz boost\n*2 GB of DDR3 RAM\n*32/64 GB of integrated eMMC storage\n*8 inch IPS HD 1280 x 800 res, 189 ppi LCD (LED lit) display; 10 point capacitive touch screen\n*Long lasting battery, 8-10 hours\n*0.87 lbs\n*wifi b/g/n dual band WiFi w/ Bluetooth 4.0 capability\n*micro usb a+b port (doubles as charging port)\n*volume up/down buttons\n*Micro SD expansion slot\n*built in speaker and microphone\n*5 mp rear camera/ 1.2 mp front facing camera\n*Accelerometer for orientation, Compass, and AGPS (WiFi assisted GPS)\n\nUseful Accessories:\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Fintie-Blade-X1-Dell-Venue-8-Pro-Windows-8-1-Keyboard-Case-Ultra-Slim-Shell-Stand-Cover-with-Magnetically-Detachable-Wireless-Bluetooth-Keyboard-Only-Fit-DELL-Venue-8-Pro-Windows-8-1-tablet-Black/dp/B00JM17LNW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Fintie Blade X1 Dell Venue 8 Pro (Windows 8.1) Keyboard Case - Ultra Slim Shell Stand Cover with Magnetically Detachable Wireless Bluetooth Keyboard (Only Fit DELL Venue 8 Pro Windows 8.1 tablet) - Black</a>\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/SanDisk-Extreme-Plus-32GB-MicroSDHC-UHS-I-Memory-Card-Speed-Up-To-80MB-s-With-Adapter-Frustration-Free-Packaging-SDSDQX-032G-AFFP-A/dp/B00DM1BDKU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">SanDisk Extreme Plus 32GB MicroSDHC UHS-I Memory Card Speed Up To 80MB/s With Adapter, Frustration-Free Packaging- SDSDQX-032G-AFFP-A</a>\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/SanDisk-Extreme-Plus-64GB-MicroSDXC-UHS-I-Memory-Card-Speed-Up-To-80MB-s-With-Adapter-Frustration-Free-Packaging-SDSDQX-064G-AFFP-A/dp/B00DM1BDPK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">SanDisk Extreme Plus 64GB MicroSDXC UHS-I Memory Card Speed Up To 80MB/s With Adapter, Frustration-Free Packaging- SDSDQX-064G-AFFP-A</a>\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/EEEKit-Office-3-in-1-Kit-for-Dell-Venue-8-Inch-Pro-ASUS-Transformer-Book-T100TA-C1-GR-Windows-8-1-Tablet-Micro-USB-B-5Pin-Male-to-USB-A-Female-with-Angle-Adapter-Host-Mode-OTG-Cable-3-Port-USB-Hub-2-4G-Wireless-Mouse-Black/dp/B00HY8P89E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">EEEKit Office 3-in-1 Kit for Dell Venue 8 Inch Pro ASUS Transformer Book T100TA-C1-GR Windows 8.1 Tablet, Micro USB B 5Pin Male to USB A Female with Angle Adapter Host Mode OTG Cable + 3 Port USB Hub + 2.4G Wireless Mouse Black</a>\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Port-USB-Power-at-the-same-time-for-mobile-devices/dp/B00J5S2TS4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">+Port: USB + Power at the same time for mobile devices</a>\n(solution for the inability to charge and use the USB port at the same time)(I have not purchased this yet)"}

I just spent an hour on hold between 4 groups, talking to people a total of maybe five minutes, when the final person acted as if he couldn't hear me (the previous three people could hear me just fine) and hung up on me. I called back, got someone who said they wouldn't do a refund and passed me to tech support. While on hold, I was again disconnected.\n\nNo company that intentionally provides such poor customer service should get your business."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I do not recommend the Dell Venue 8 Pro (V8P). Ive owned mine for about 6 months. I bought it to replace my iPad. I use Windows PCs exclusively at work. I have a Windows laptop for travel and a Windows desktop at home and a Windows 8 phone. I was hoping the V8P would be an acceptable compromise between my iPad and my laptop, especially when travelling, and unify me into a single ecosystem. Unfortunately it failed.\n\nHere is my experience and opinions:\n\nHARDWARE\nTouch. The touch has a problem. It often thinks that that I am double clicking when I touch the screen. This causes things like websites to suddenly get large or get small when I am simply trying to scroll, icons execute, keys double enter (a real pain when entering passwords), etc. I took the screen protector off as research suggested and reset the touch settings. These helped a bit, but the problem is still frequent.\nText. Selecting text is difficult. In comparison it is easy on the iPad. Luckily the keyboard has arrow keys.\nDisk space. My C: drive shows 23 Gigabytes in size. Only 7 Gig of it is free for me to use. So I have put a 64 Gig MicroSD card to augment the space. The card is slow. The V8P does not support fast MicroUSB cards.\nUSB card. The MicroUSB card disappears every time I reboot. To see it again, I have to take the card out, and then reinsert it. I will see it again until the next time I reboot. This problem is very common with the V8P.\nPerformance. The V8P is underpowered. It seems fast most of the time. It boots quickly, applications start quickly. But I often find myself waiting for a response. There is no spinning cursor to tell me that it is working, it just doesnt do anything. Then multiple things happen at once.\nBlack. Sometimes the V8P does not awaken from sleep. The screen just stays black. I have to hold the power button down for 11 seconds or so to kill the V8P. Then wait a few seconds. Then press the power for a few seconds to power it back up.\nCamera. The camera really is very poor. The shutter is slow, the pictures are grainy and the color is poor. In contrast, my iPad took gorgeous pictures! My cell phone three phones ago took better pictures. My old Kodak Instamatic 110 took better pictures in 1974.\nBattery. Mine lasts about six hours. Less if I am typing or browsing. Even less if I am watching videos. It charges only from the wall wart; it does not charge when plugged into a USB port on a PC.\nConnections. Only one micro USB connector. Does not connect to most external displays without special equipment. If charging, I cant connect to external USB drives without special equipment.\nSpecial equipment. A tiny fraction compared to what is available for the iPad and Android tablets.\n\nWINDOWS\nMetro. All I use the Metro desktop for is to launch applications. It is a lot like having the icons on my desktop.\nApps. Mail, Calendar and Reader are the only Metro apps I use. Compared to iPad or Android, there are almost no Windows 8 Metro apps. It is so disappointing. The apps that do exist are stunted versions of the same apps that are great on the iPad or Android. Better to use the websites instead. Even the Microsoft Metro apps are limited functionality compared to their website or their desktop apps. Consider just traveling somewhere. There are several hundred apps on the iPad that schedule flights, book hotels, provide directions, reminders, etc. On the V8P, only a handful of major companies have metro apps which are so limited in functionality, it is better to use their websites. The iPad really spoiled me, all the great apps that were available. There are more apps for my Windows 8 phone than for the V8P.\nMail. The Metro Mail app mimics the mail app on the iPad. It works okay.\nMusic. Like the iPad, the V8P allows music to be playing when the screen is turned off. Unfortunately, the only app that I have that supports this is Xbox Music. No Pandora app means I have to use the browser. Music played through the browser stops when the V8P screen is turned off. At least Spotify has a desktop app, but desktop music apps also stop playing when the V8P screen is turned off. I have to keep the screen on in order to play music. Outside of Xbox Music, I don't know how to turn off the screen (to save battery life) and still listen to music.\nBrowser. The Metro version of IE 11 works well. It is probably my more favorite browsers for browsing. A lot of websites didn't support the new IE 11 at first, but this is getting better. But it is missing some key features. Like history  you are unable to see the pages you visited yesterday for example, and you cannot delete history. The metro version doesnt run any plugins, like Ad Block for example. Accessing favorites requires scrolling to the right for days. Sometimes it remembers the home page, most often it doesnt. You can put favorites as tiles on the Metro home, but I have hundreds of favorites in dozens of groups. It is terrible clutter on the Metro home. There is a second, additionally IE 11 that runs on the desktop, but it takes almost 30 seconds to open on the underpowered V8P. Like other desktop apps, IE 11 is almost too small to use (i.e., menus full of links) and some websites don't respond to touch (i.e., Google)  you have to use a mouse.\n\nWindows desktop. I use many applications that run in normal Windows, that is the desktop. While the V8P runs desktop applications, the desktop is so small it is all but unusable. It is a normal Windows desktop shrunk down to about 1/4th the size. I can use Remote Desktop to access another Windows PC, but the resultant desktop is so tiny I almost cant work in it. I don't know how make it bigger either. I cannot pinch to zoom. Little tiny buttons, little tiny menus which are hard to use even with a stylus. If I need to enter data, the on screen keyboard takes up the entire bottom half of the screen  I can only see the top two inches of the desktop.\nMS Office. I work a lot with Word and Excel. The V8P runs Work and Excel as desktop applications. The buttons on ribbons are so small they are almost unusable. Shortly after I sold my iPad, MS announced Office on the iPad. Bummer.\nOneDrive. A big feature of Windows 8 is OneDrive, which syncs your files between all your computers. It works pretty well. Unfortunately, sometimes it creates duplicates of a file. So I have the same file two, three, . multiple times. I don't know why this happens. I have to figure out what is different between each file and manually consolidate the changes.\nUpdates. As I write this, there is no Windows 8.1 update for the V8P yet. If there is, I don't know how to get it.\n\nBOTTOM LINE\nI do not recommend the V8P. The hardware is underpowered and problematic. The Windows desktop is too small to be usable. There are very few Metro apps.\n\nWhen my friends ask my opinion on which tablet to buy, I recommend the iPad, especially if there is an Apple store nearby. I strongly recommend against the Windows 8 tablets, especially the V8P. If you really want or need a Windows tablet, look into the Surface instead.\n\nI am ultimately unsatisfied with my V8P and plan on replacing it within the next couple of months."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "IMPORTANT: IF YOU WANT THE INCLUDED OFFICE 2013 SOFTWARE, MAKE SURE YOUR SELLER IS GIVING YOU THE PRODUCT KEY WITH YOUR USED/REFURBISHED PURCHASE. \"PREINSTALLED\" doesn't mean anything. Ask your seller. It seems that the majority of sellers on the web who carry the Venue 8 Pro will buy the tablet, take out the Office product key, and then resell the tablet (at a little under retail price) and the Office key SEPARATELY either to try to make more or because they took the key and activated Office for themselves. Think about it - you buy the tablet for $249, take out the Office key, resell the tablet for $200 (not informing the customer you've removed the key), and sell the Office key for $100... instant $50 profit from NOTHING! For whatever reason, to my dismay, it seems that this is \"common practice\" and something to be expected from merchants selling used Venue 8 Pros and similar products, whereas I see it as utterly immoral and misleading. The Amazon product description leads you to believe that the tablet has Office 2013 preinstalled and that upon receiving a used, reset tablet, you can just launch Word and start using it. You must know that Office 2013 is \"preinstalled\" on the tablet as an \"INSTALL MICROSOFT OFFICE\" app, which upon opening prompts the customer to enter a Office 2013 product key. Without the product key, \"preinstalled\" or not, the software is USELESS. This is not the Surface RT, which runs on an operating system with Office literally built in, this has full x86 Windows 8.1 and Office needs to be installed and activated just like it does on any other Windows machine.\n\nNow, to my review:\n\nProducts like this are difficult to review because it is difficult to pinpoint their category. It is a $200 budget widescreen tablet, so it is a Nexus 7 competitor? Yet, it is also a full quad-core Windows machine running an x86 operating system. I still scratch my head at the thought: a full Windows machine for $200?!?\n\nIt's hard to say what the Venue 8 pro is, and the onboard Windows 8.1 in my opinion doesn't help with its dual user interfaces, fuzzing the line between tablet and computer even further. But I do know one thing about this tablet: I love it.\n\nFor $200, it's a geek toy and in a way should be treated as such, but it is so much more capable than a toy tablet. I admit - when I owned an iPad mini I told myself that it could do this and do that with my shiny little tablet, and always ended up just watching YouTube videos and reading email. But the Venue 8 Pro can actually go beyond that. When I have it on the go or around my house, yes, it immediately becomes a consumption device. Watching videos, viewing photos/basic editing, basically becoming an iPad mini or Nexus 7 but with fewer touch-friendly apps. But as soon as I dock it in with a keyboard and mouse, it's a computer and I am writing Word documents, reports, and running statistics software.\n\nSpeaking of a keyboard and mouse, the \"docking\" factor is also the Venue 8 Pro's biggest weakness - while it is a fully capable quad-core Windows machine on the inside, one simply cannot make use of all its power without desktop accessories. The Windows on-screen keyboard is good, and for some reason I type better with it than I do with KitKat's stock keyboard, but typing anything long is just a massive waste of time no matter how fast you are with a touch keyboard. It supports Synaptics active pen input, and while that solves the problem of the lack of accurate pointing device, it doesn't address the lack of a keyboard as standard. That's one thing the Surface RT did right, for instance, as many compromises as that device had - Microsoft (eventually) bundled it with the keyboard case because it was an integral part of the Windows working experience. The moral of the story: if you get the Venue 8 Pro, get some USB accessories like a keyboard and mouse - you won't regret it.\n\nUsing accessories with the Venue 8 Pro is a bit sketchy. It has one microUSB port that doubles as the charging port, so while USB OTG adapters allow you to plug in your USB peripherals, it cancels your device's ability to simultaneously charge. There are ways around this (Google to see what I mean) that feel hacky and not a fluid experience, involving multiple cables, fooling the tablet into thinking it's plugged into one thing when it's not using switches, etc. There are third party Kickstarter projects that aim to address this problem specifically for this tablet and others with similar issues, but if you're interested in making this tablet a true, low-power desktop replacement, make sure you do your research and know what you're doing with that one microUSB port. When you do figure it out, however, the tablet works great. I'm not even going to deduct a star because I really have no complaints in doing a tiny bit of hacking with the $165 price I paid. Note that the tablet DOES NOT come with a USB OTG adapter included - you'll have to get your own, but they're only about a dollar on Amazon.\n\nAs for the hardware itself, I found the Venue 8 Pro to be the most physically attractive in the small-form-factor x86 Windows 8 tablet range. It has a very clean front panel, shiny metal buttons that actually feel like they're metal (not sure if they really are), and the back of the device, where so many other consumer electronics just stop caring about aesthetics, looks really good with its concentric, rubberized grooves. This gives you a great grip on the tablet, which is important as it is just a tad too heavy to be used with one hand for long periods of time. The display is absolutely lovely - 1280x800 doesn't sound like much but on an 8-inch screen with Windows ClearType font smoothing, it looks real good. and very crisp. I have had no gripes with pixel density, and while I often cringe when switching from my gorgeous iPad air's 2048x1536 to anything else, I don't find the Dell's display to be fuzzy or pixely at all. The colors also help - color saturation is wonderful, and viewing angles are amazing as expected from an IPS panel. It's just a great display, really good for watching videos. I still wouldn't edit photos on it just yet (~70% sRGB), but for consumption it has one of the better displays I have seen.\n\nI really wish that the tablet came with more onboard storage, but who can I blame but myself?! I bought the 32GB version and my only regret was not bumping it up to 64GB because upon a clean Windows reset, I had about 11GB of free space on the onboard storage. Upon installing Office and some other basic apps, I am down to about 4GB. This makes the microSD slot on the Venue 8 Pro absolutely priceless. I have installed games to it, stored most of my files on it now, and this almost completely solves the issue of low storage capacity (except for the fact that it takes a hack to install Windows Store Modern UI apps to external storage). If you're worried about storage, I strongly recommend getting the 64GB model.\n\nBattery life is amazing from this little Windows machine. For the amount I use it, it lasts a whole day, sometimes overnight without charging. Windows hibernates very well and it appears that the Bay Trail Atom CPU is very power-efficient. Speaking of the CPU, the back of the device can get really hot when doing something intensive like playing a game. Playing a racing game while holding the tablet can make you really feel the burn on your fingertips, and when running an actual game like Command and Conquer 3 or Half-Life 2 (games like this run surprisingly well at lower settings with playable frame rates!)? Yeah, it gets really hot. It feels like it wants a fan, but of course the design doesn't allow for it. I haven't noticed the CPU throttling at all, however, which is good as performance feels consistent. Apps open snappily for the most part and perform quite well. Way more than enough speed for something basic like Office or web browsing, you can try and push the limits by playing some games on it or running Photoshop! There ARE, however, times when I feel like Windows wants more RAM and can't get any. The onboard 2GB just isn't enough to multitask like you would on a desktop machine, but again, for maybe 4-5 apps open at once with a few browser tabs, you're fine. I've found this table GREAT for using Steam's in-home streaming feature: with my Xbox 360 controller, it effectively turns the tablet into a makeshift Nvidia Shield if you know what that is :)\n\nAs was true of the iPad mini when it came out, Windows touchscreen apps scale beautifully to the smaller form factor. Even the desktop mode feels good, which was my largest concern considering how small buttons would get. However, with my massive pianist fingertips I could resize windows, manipulate text, and do just about anything I could with a mouse with ease. That's not even with a stylus. I won't talk about the stylus as I believe that should be part of a separate review for the stylus itself (especially because it doesn't come bundled but instead is a separate accessory) but it has mixed results. The one area of the touch experience that I find detracting from a great experience is screen rotation - The device is small enough that it is comfortable to use in portrait mode, even as a widescreen tablet (I usually prefer Apple's 4:3 aspect ratio style for portrait/landscape switching), but Windows makes it REALLY SLOW to switch orientations. Tilt your device, and it actually takes upward of 1 or 2 seconds for the device to recognize its new orientation and adapt its contents to your liking. This is terrible if you're someone like me who carries their tablet everywhere, on planes, into bed, and if you accidentally tilt it too far in one direction, you think your tablet freezes for a few seconds as it struggles to catch up with the new orientation. I've found this true of Windows tablets in general, not necessarily for the Venue 8 Pro alone. I often find myself just disabling screen rotation when I'm on the go so I don't have to deal with this.\n\nThe speaker is super loud on the Venue 8 Pro, making it great for Skype calling and casual video watching, but not great for long-term film watching or gaming. It is on the tinny side for speakers, only has one channel, and distorts at high volumes. This cannot compete with Amazon's Kindle Fire lineup when it comes to audio quality, nor even with Apple's iPad lineup. With headphones, the onboard DAC is just okay. It's a tad better than average for tablets in its size class (lightyears better than some of the terrible, cheap Android tablets I've played with), but not something I would use for long-term music listening. Listening to iTunes while doing some work? Sure, why not, it's good enough.\n\nThe cameras are nothing special. Both are terrible for taking still shots or even videos, but more than decent for making video calls. The fact that it has both a front-facing and back-facing camera for the price is just an added bonus.\n\n As you can tell, I really enjoy the tablet, and having only paid $165 for a refurbished one here on Amazon, I really can't complain. Microsoft Office 2013 Home and Student alone costs some $90-140, so if you look at it that way, you're paying some $30-40 for a fully functioning quad-core Windows 8 tablet. I say if you want one, go get one, because there's so little room for regret here. Even if a few features are lacking, it'll likely make up for it for you because it's just so feature-packed."}

It's clear this has a sharper image than the non-retina iPad mini -- in fact despite the fact this is not 1080, I'm not sure many people would  complain.  The colors are gorgeous, and it is a pleasure to watch videos on this.  The image is better than the non-retina, and not as good as the retina display, but it sure looks good to me and most people who have seen it.\n\nThere are many things that simply make this a superior value to an iPad - boosting intermal storage to 64 gig from 32 was only an additional $12, versus the rip-off Apple charges for more storage -plus you can add a memory card, and have (micro) USB. i paid about $250 for this tablet, with 64 gig storage (SSD) 2 gig of RAM, and with USB access.  Peripherals are vastly more reasonable than with Apple.  My all-over case was only $8, while it was $40 for just a front cover for my wife's similar size iPad mini.\n\nFull MS Office makes it an even nicer deal -ALTHOUGH - am I really going to use an 8\" tablet as a productivity device?  This really is a full-on Windows 8 PC, which is an awesome idea, but in an 8 inch tablet, that may have limited benefit.\n\nThe above are strong points vs iPad mini.  But on the other side, I have to say the iPad has less trouble with the touch capabilities, lots more apps (especially tablet native games).  Technically speaking, the Windows tablet can do a whole lot more because of the vast number of Windows programs, but I find it's not practical to use this tablet for full-on PC games.  It looks like it can functionally run them, but you need an external controller to play successfully.  This to me is an issue.\n\nThat said, I'm personally trying to not be too invested in the Apple ecosystem (3 iPhones, 1 iPad and 1 Apple TV in the household, but lots of Windows laptops). But I have to admit the Apple iPad is probably best for those who are just looking for an easy, low frustration experience, and aren't so interested in playing with tech for tech's sake - and aren't tightwads like me!"}

If the internet connection was dead, it would take a while to unlock the machine. I set it up to unlock with a PIN and this issue resolved itself.\n\nPerformance:\n\nThis is where this little tablet excels.  I take that back, this is not a tablet like you've become accustomed to (i.e. Android tablets or iPads). This is a fully functional computer. I don't have use for a bunch of \"apps\" for this or that. It will do anything you'd want through the Explorer browser.

I've watched several movies on a charge and it gets doesn't seem to show signs of stopping any time soon.\n\nIt gets warm (not hot) after being run for a few hours.\n\nInterface:\n\nThe touch gestures came naturally. To close an application just swipe from the top of the screen all the way down until the application disappears.  To minimize an application, swipe from the top to the left and you'll see it dock to the left and sort of disappear. To bring your application/window back, just \"pull\" it out from the left and it will appear. Try experimenting with these types of gestures, because you can dock your windows and adjust them by pulling them around the screen.\n\nIt isn't too heavy to hold for an hour or so watching a movie. I've watched several and my hand or wrist doesn't seem to get tired.\n\nWindows 8.1:\nFrustration. It updated once and seemed to have been stuck on some black screen somehow. I fiddled with combination button presses and reset it a few times and somehow got it back to the home screen.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis is an excellent product at an unheard of price. Dell did a great job on this machine. For functionality and a pure joy to operate at this price, this machine should be a 5 star product.

I don't really use the speaker but I found it to be much better than I expected. I would recommend using external speakers or ear buds (or headphones) to listen to music. After all a tablet speaker can never really be that good. The battery life is not too bad, I would say 8-10 hours depending on usage. I would never expect the battery on a tablet this small to last much longer than that. As the battery technology continues to improve that will change with time.\n\nThere are only two CON's that I can think of. If you use the virtual keyboard it is VERY easy for it to repeat characters. I will be using the Bluetooth keyboard the vast majority of the time so I consider that just a annoyance. The other is that there is only one microUSB port. The battery is charged with this port too.\n\nOh, I almost forgot. When I first got it and was setting it up at one point I noticed the battery was at 89% and it said it was plugged in but not charging (it also had to be plugged into an actual wall outlet not a surge protector). I went out to Dell's site and searched for that. It turns out all I needed to do was upgrade the BIOS to the current version and that fixed it right up. It now charges up to 100% and stops charging like it's supposed to. It will also now charge from a surge protected outlet as well. That was really no biggie for me. When you get any new machine you really should make sure that you upgrade to the latest BIOS and drivers anyway.\n\nSo I personally give this 5 stars!!!\n\nUpdate 9/25/2015\n\nI got the free upgrade to Windows 10. It installed with absolutely no problems.\nI really enjoy using this tablet. Oh, go buy the dongle that will allow you to charge and use a USB drive at the same time (from Dell)."}

I was basically looking for the perfect device for my home computing needs. Each were great but had issues that detracted from their utility and comfort. In order;\nChormebook:\n* Great functions but did not run specific Microsoft Apps I needed or access to my online lectures from my college course.\n* Google Docs was fantastic to work with but had issues sometimes converting some aspects to Microsoft Word.\n* Limited availability of applications\nMicrosoft Surface RT:\n* Great build quality and had enough apps to be useful.\n* Windows RT will not run certain Microsoft Applications like SilverLight which was essential to my access to online lectures from my school.\n* Always updating.\n* Kind of big.\nDell Inspiron 15 (3521):\n* Ran everything perfectly. It really soared when I increased the RAM to 8GB.\n* Got very hot when doing long sessions.\n* Too big for me to lug around in the house.\nI really liked the Tablet concept from my experience with the Microsoft Surface RT but knew I need Windows 8.1 pro. Did my research and got a Dell Venue 8 64GB tablet. I have found nothing to dislike about it other than it took two whole hours for all the updating to get done to include adding my own subscription Anti-Virus (it comes with MacPhee preloaded but I don't have subscription for it). I have also had to play with the sleep mode and other settings to keept it from shutting down while running the Kindle app. One cool note, when I logged on with my Microsoft live account, all my Surface RT apps were loaded as well as my preferences.  Biggest issue is the learning curve but it gets a little less steeper each day. I would say it is like a tablet sized laptop but still cannot fully replace one.  The 64GB storage is more than adequate, I have less than 60% left, especially if you use OneDrive. To close, it is not a game machine but is a damn fine alternative to a laptop for low intensity users."}

I purchased the Dell Venue 8 Pro over  the Christmas holidays and started using in January 2014.  I had a problem with the battery not charging when I opened the box.  I called technical support and they assured me that if I waited 20 mins there would be enough charge to turn on the tablet. First issue - why won't it turn on when plugged into a wall.  Besides this annoyance the tablet seemed to work well  -  I used on and off for several months.  Eventually the tablet wouldn't charge at all. Dell had me send it for repair and they replaced the mother board and operating system in about a weeks time.  When I turned on the tablet, the connection to the internet was slow and tablet was displaying eratic behavior moving between apps, etc.  I called technical support and Dell said tablet had been returned to me without the latest bios, firmware, etc., and I would have to spend my valuable free time downloading and upgrading software with them.  After over an hour of this I realized this didn't make any sense and asked them to take the tablet back and do it themselves - I should expect a functional tablet - right?  Well, just got it back from the second repair and light indicating the tablet is charging is not working, I cannot tell if the tablet is charging and  assume its not, and lastly Dell support tells me they don't upgrade firmware, bios or put what I bought the tablet for initially - the Microsoft office suite on - except over the phone.  I don't have time to spend with technical support to do this type of stuff. I don't recommend spending $199 for this unit as you'll spend more time with technical support than the value of the tablet.  Lastly, I  couldn't find the active pen available for purchase when I purchased this.  After googling, I found the active pen kept draining the battery but by March Dell had working pen. I quickly bought the pen and now found out that you need to upgrade the software on your tablet so the pen won't drain the tablets battery.  I was told when I sent the tablet in the first time the firmware would be loaded and the pen would no longer drain the battery. I feel I am throwing money out the window with this purchase."}

See http://en.community.dell.com/support-forums/mobile-devices/f/4586/t/19533276.aspx for a description of this problem that many, many people with the device seem to have.\n\nI had never forcibly pushed the supplied charger into the charging port the wrong way, but of course, it being a trapezoidal charger with a square port-hole, I had often gently seen if it would go in one way, felt the resistance, and flipped the charger over to finish inserting it.  One day - just as everyone else describes - the charging port's pins were suddenly so bent that the supplied charging cable could no longer fit properly and charge the device.\n\nIt is still under warranty, and Dell has sent me a box to ship it back to them in so that they can fix it, but I have heard from people who have done this that it is only a matter of months before the problem starts all over again, and eventually, you run out of warranty.\n\nI agree with the posters at the URL that I supplied that Dell should IMMEDIATELY stop issuing DVP8's with a Micro-A/B charging port and start issuing them with a port that exactly matches the cable so that attempting to gently plug the cable in upside-down will merely scratch the plastic, not damage the pins.\n\nThis device is bound to simply power down and never come to life again, as currently manufactured.

However, this tablet is as reliable as an old \"French\" car or an old Range Rover. Sometimes it works, sometimes it does not.\n\nMy goal was mainly to have a travel device I can use with all my applications and have less weight to travel with. The device meets all these criteria, it is fast, lightweight, feels great in your hand due to the sleek ripple cover on the back, has just enough power for anything you do, it is cheap (well affordable or very affordable considering the $260 price tag for a 64GB version) and is just the right size for travel.\n\nHowever, it has a massive battery charging issue, that make the device not turn on based on, I think, battery memory issue. If that works, by only using the original charger, not overcharging, making sure you get the battery close to empty, but not all empty so it does not get to hot during charge and does not power up until you let the battery drain again, you have issue with the Wifi + Bluetooth adapter that if you connect a outlandish device like let's say a Keyboard and a Mouse, they reconnect as an example in your hotel before the device is connected to Wifi, your Wifi adapter goes missing.\n\nYou can fix that, but it requires to remove the driver reboot and so on. Some happens when going to airplane mode, just that you only have to reinstall the drive every other time, but the boot is required every time.\n\nLike I said I wanted to like this device so much and frankly love it as a concept. However, a travel tablet that requires me to carry another machine, my MBA 11, is really not what it was supposed to be. I now also purchased a Thinkpad 8 that seems more reliable, but concept wise with the Aluminum casing not sitting well in your hand and with its black shiny back retaining every fingerprint (good for forensics) it at least is reliable.\n\nDell & Lenovo, could you guys get together and Dell contributes the casing and feel, while Lenovo delivers the guts? If this device every gets reliable, I would easily give it 4 to 5 stars, this way it is an overpriced paperweight!"}

I worked for several hours trying to get Firefox installed and running. I'm not a nerd, but I do know what I'm doing. Bahhh! Back to Amazon. Ditto for windows 8. What a mess. Last year I bought an inexpensive windows 7 ultrabook, which sadly is no longer available. Haven't found a windows 8 tablet to supplement it. My advice - don't buy this; and if possible avoid any windows 8 device'. Fortunately, Amazon has a liberal return policy. Now, for all of it's limitations, the Kindle fire is looking better to me as a small tablet platform."}

The return window has passed and looks like I will be stuck with a lemon. Typical lack of Dell quality control.\n\nMy office has around 10 dell optiplex's which are only around 3 years old. Almost every one of them had the power supply go out. Even though dell replaced some early on, they will no longer replace them as they \"are out of warranty\". In my business if I had an entire batch of products fail that did not appear to be a fluke I would make the situation right. I told that to the dell rep and they had not interest in helping me and they will not help you either. I should have known from this that the dell tablet might go the same way, but the price was too low to pass up.

Bought a Dell android tablet which had a freezing screen problem that turned into streaks of grey  after 5 minutes of use, which was not repairable.\n\nI did some research and found out about this tablet with a full version of Windows 8.1. It complements my Windows 8.1 desktop PC and Windows phone perfectly!\n\nI now use my PC desktop much less as I'm very capable of doing my office tasks for my business on this tablet. I absolutely love it.\n\nI prefer to use this nice easy to hold tablet. Dell got it right. The screen size is in the right range and the display is beautiful to view.\n\nI have a small WiFi Verizon 4g LTE portable hotspot I carry around rather than tether it to my phone which is easy to do, but, I can handle a greater amount of tasks and bandwidth and not slow down interactions with clients. Most clients are 1:1 or 1:2 meetings and this is perfect for intimate presentations.\n\nNow that I have used it for almost three weeks, I'm so glad I purchased it. I put in 16gb SD micro card, and with Microsoft's OneDrive of over 180gbs I have plenty of room for data. If you need alot of apps get the 64gbs version, as I am about 15% away from using up the 32gbs of space for the operating system and apps.\n\nI recommend this tablet as an alternative to any android or apple product of comparable size.\n\nThe display and usability more than meets my expectations."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "The tablet is nice but it's just really not a large enough screen for Windows.  Too many items are just far too small to tap on.  Plus, some of the Control Panel items simply don't fit on the screen.  Just imagine if the \"OK\" and \"CANCEL\" buttons (along with other check boxes) were beyond your reach and off the screen.  Yes, it's a resolution problem, but if the boxes did fit they'd be far too small to read.  Other software I tried to install refused due to the resolution.  If you want a Windows tablet, don't bother with a small screen.\n\nAnother problem I run into is with the on-screen keyboard.  Half the time it doesn't pop up when needed.  You have to manually force it but then it doesn't retract automatically.  It may seem like a minor annoyance but it quickly grows into more.  Again, it's a Windows problem rather than a Dell issue.\n\nThe last time I checked the app store, it was rather lacking.  Various thing I'm used to having on my iPad and Android tablets simply weren't available.  Some that were free on the others were not here.  Or there were crappy knock-offs that only made you roll your eyes if you were familiar with the real deals.\n\nAs for regular Windows programs, keep in mind that most were NOT designed for a touch interface.  You will find it hard to work with.  Imagine a spreadsheet and trying to tap on a really tiny cell only to have it select another.  Or trying to position your cursor on a word processing document and it going to the wrong line.  Really, regular programs just aren't meant for a small tablet screen.\n\nIf I had it to do over, I'd certainly never buy this model again.  It'd have to be a 10\" screen with more resolution to get past the Windows problems.  Plus, I wouldn't do it until Microsoft takes care of some of the problems I've mention above.  Maybe around Windows 10 or so..."}

A week after buying this tablet, I dropped it off the nightstand in my bedroom, cracking the screen.  Expected to pay for the repairs, but Dell sent me a new Tablet, Factory Refurbished, but with a Year warranty at no cost to me.  I did not have nay kidn of extended warranty.  So kudos to Dell for a wonderufl experience.\nSo the tablet is pretty awesome.  yes, the single speaker is tinny and not fantastic at high volumes.  If you lay it in your lap in portrait, the sound is muffled.  The screen is very bright and very sharp.  No, it's not as sharp as a retina display.  I like my display bright, but I find that this thing relaly lights up a room, so it's rarely over 30%.  Of course, this is post Dell update for the ambient light sensor.  Prior to that, the screen was noticeabley dim when the auto brightness was engaged.  The 8 inch is a good form factor.  A nice compromise for the tablet.  I bought the stylus and it is wonderful.  OneNote is excellent. Also of note(Pun intended)  are Works Note Pro and Scribl.  Happy to say that even with the Grafiti like keyboard interface, answerign e-mail is an absolute piece of cake.  The letter recognition is really good.  I don't have the best handwriting, but this thing picks it up pretty quickly and is very accurate, even in my half-printing/half-cursive scrawl.  Also, I use an old Toshiba Dynadock V to use it as a desktop on my 24 inch HP monitor.  It works like a charm. The resolution is not ultra fantastic, but it is completely usable and a lot of fun.  Touchme Gesture studio adds even more functionality like setting it up to shutdown when I press 5 fingers inward, or increase the volume when I use 4 finger swipe left.  I have a 32 Gb microsd in it and tons of apps, so it's sitting at about 20 Gb free on the device and probably 15 Gb free when I move 8 Gb of music and various ebooks to the Sd card.  Very happy with the purchase after 4 weeks of using it."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I had to read a lot of reviews on Amazon as well as on the web.  I finally came to a decision that this tablet was the right choice.  Only question was do I get a 32G or 64G.  In the end I went for the bigger drive size.  The build quality and feel of the Venue Pro is solid. The push buttons for the Windows key, power and volume were easy to push and had a solid feel to them.  The testing I performed on the tablet was mostly for how long the battery would last with constant use on the WiFi using Netflix.  I found this unit to be at the 6 hr mark with full brightness and sound going.  Pretty good IMO.  I'm sure with normal usage on the web and no video usage the tablet could easily accomplish the 8.5 hr rating I saw another review site reported.  I was able to plug in a micro SD card with some movies on it and found Windows 8 to have no problem with recognizing the media and playing the movies off the card.  No lag or errors encountered.  I love the \"grippy\" texture of the back and it adds to the comfort when holding it.  I never got around to testing the cameras so I can't report anything positive or negative about it.  About the only CON I have is the micro usb port.  This is the first time I have seen a micro USB port where you can't determine which side is the smaller side just by looking at it.  You'll see what I mean if you get a hold of one.  Overall, this tablet is what Windows users have been waiting for.  Definitely a 5 star rating in my book.  Now I need to get a good case and bluetooth keyboard and I'll be all set."}

Unfortunately this tablet just doesn't stack up. It isn't quite a tablet environment and not quite a full computer environment. The start menu is the only thing that is well suited for the touch screen. Programs not built specifically for Windows 8 run as normal, meant to be used with a keyboard and mouse, programs made specifically to run on Windows 8 run on a touch screen but take up the whole screen and switching between them is clunky. The keyboard is also a nuisance, to type on the touch screen you have to first touch where you have to type (this is where it should bring up the keyboard) you then have to hit the keyboard button to bring up the keyboard. If the field you are typing in is in the lower part of the screen it will be covered by the keyboard and you have to close the keyboard and move it up then open the keyboard again.\n\nYou should either get a full computer with Windows 7 or get an Android or iOS tablet, this takes the worst features of both and combines them.

A couple of days later, when I contacted the seller, a very nice lady told me that she will send me an emil regarding the shipment of this item. As promised, she sent me an email the following day with a tracking number and delivery date, by the way, was earlier than the expected delivery date. I received the the tablet on time. The tablet is amazing. It has full windows 8.1 and Microsoft office 2013. Works perfectly well. The only problem with the tablet is that I cannot download files from my pc to the tablet or the other way around using the included USB cable. Even though my pc has bluetooth capability, I was unable to pair it with the pc. That is okay because I use an SD card in the tablet.\nWhat I like and appreciated most is the professionalism and customer care of this seller. When I noticed that the keyboard case and stylus were missing, I contacted the seller. She was very courteous and told me that she will email me an Amazon gift card to cover the cost of stylus and case. She sent me a gift card worth $20 the next day. When I checked the price of the keyboard case and stylus, I found that they cost $52.99. I emailed the seller again. Without any argument or questions, JH Business send me an additional $32.99. I was amazed by the promptness and highest standards JH Business follows. These days when companies big and small give hard time to customers to increase their profits, JH Business is and exception.  I highly recommend JH Business and give them FIVE STARS. Of note, the lady whom I contacted was none other than Dr. Julia Hollins, who runs JH Business."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "After 4 months using it as a tablet, and just fiddling around with it as a laptop, I have found a lot of stuff you can do and can't do with it.\n\nCONS (stuff you got to know before buying):\n\nDon't expect this to replace your writing notebook. I have the 2nd revision of the stylus, and although it is much improved from the old stylus, the glitches are just far less frequent, but they are still there. I'm talking about the pen leaving unwanted strokes, and the pen-buttons being unresponsive. The pen slowly kills the battery even when not in-use. There is no off button on the pen. There is no rechargeable quadruple-A battery (AAAA) on the market. For a $40 pen, this is totally unacceptable. In addition, Windows is really bad at palm recognition too, but you can always turn off the touch-screen input at device manger. The screen size is also far too small to write like a notebook. The pen is good for doing mousy work like clicking on things that would otherwise be too small to touch, but that is it. I guess jotting down quick note with Note MX is fine too, otherwise you should look into the Surface Pro, or even better is the Galaxy Note tablets.\n\nPhotoshop is impractical. It is too slow. If you use the pen, you're going to cause a lot of stroke lag. You are actually better off using the pen with Paint. But you should still manually turn off the touch-screen input because the palm recognition just sucks.\n\nThere are almost no touch-screen games for Windows unless you get the games from the Apps Store (which are really just Android/iPad type games). The only real Windows game I found was Civilization V, but it was too slow to play.\n\nMost games that came out within the last 10 years will run slow assuming you have already turned down the graphics all the way. More recent games will obviously run even slower. Although this tablet is more than capabile of running older games, you will have compatibility issues with Windows 8.1.\n\nYou cannot string together multiple USB devices indefinitely. The one and only microUSB port can be connected to a USB device by OTG cable or the USB charger, but NOT at the same time.\n\nIt does NOT have any kind of TV/Monitor out port. You have to buy a Miracast adapter. Although wireless TV out is cool, it is also expensive and could cost up to $80! compared to a $6 HDMI cable.\n\nIt does not run x64 Windows application, because you get Windows 8.1 x86, and it is not even the Pro version.\n\nThe Chrome browser is too slow for the smooth touch-screen experience, but works well with mouse/keyboard. The startscreen IE doesn't support addons, therefore does not support adblocker. Desktop IE does not have auto pop-up keyboard. Eventually I settled with IE Desktop.\n\nIt does NOT support the typical USB charger. The included charger is 10W, which is much higher than most recent smartphone chargers. However, micro-USB cable is standard.\n\nUsing it as a MP3 player may not work. If you play music and press the power button, the tablet goes to sleep and your music turns off. There is no way to just turn off the screen like on an iOS or Android device.\n\nThe charge port broke once which Dell has quickly fixed within a week.\n\nPROS:\n\nThe most obvious is the ability to run native Windows applications. Think about it. VLC player and XBMC means you never have to re-encode a movie. True Image means you can continuously backup your tablet to the SD card. Adblock Plus means you never have to view another freaking Ad from websites. You can do programming. All your old Windows games could work. Full MS Office and Adobe Acrobat support and compatibility. Hulu works prefectly on high quality. Endless possibilities people.\n\nIt is lightweight and small form. I use a double folded case with a pen holder. The case is bigger than the tablet. The tablet with case is very low profile and you barely notice it in the backpack. The tablet itself looks exactly like a Nexus 7 with an 8 inch screen.\n\nWhile it would be much nicer to have a 1080p screen, the resolution still looks very sharp, and the screen quality is more than enough for watching movies and browsing pictures.\n\nThe battery life is all-day, and this is assuming that you are using it moderately heavy.\n\nThis is not a device that works like an iPad or Android tablet. Frankly as much as I want to get the next iPad or Nexus, I will regret losing a lot of Windows functionality.\n\nA Bluetooth mouse, keyboard, and maybe speaker can turn this into a very good netbook.\n\nThe built-in SSD hard drive is fast. It starts up in less than 10 seconds when completely off, which is useful because sometimes you want to prolong the battery by not having it on standby.\n\nYou can potentially have 192GB on this tablet. 64GB internal + 128GB microSD card.\n\nWebsites are highly compatible thanks to the desktop-based web browsers.\n\nIt will play 1080P on Youtube perfectly.\n\nYou can remote desktop into the tablet, or remote desktop from the tablet into another computer. No other tablet OS can do both of this.\n\nFINAL THOUGHT:\nWhy I'm giving it 5-star considering all the complaints? Well, I use this only as a tablet which means quick browsing, watching movies, photos, reading/editing documents, etc. I do not expect it to replace my laptop or desktop, but it gives me access to a lot of functionality that could never be possible on an iOS or Android device. My preferred environment is desktop-mode, but the start-screen does make it easier to find and launch applications. As far as I know, there is no better replacement for something with similar design and functionality."}

I also like the way the tablet functions except for one real annoying thing that Dell won't tell you about unless you ask. The Dell Venue 8 Pro only charges with Dell's proprietary chargers.  Sure it takes a micro USB jack but that is where it stops.  It won't charge unless you use the charger that Dell sent with the tablet.  Every other tablet and mobile device charges on other USB chargers but not Dell. My car chargers are worthless, my mobile back up battery charger is worthless, trying to charge from a computer's USB port worthless. I travel and thought the Dell Venue 8 Pro would be a great way to bring the Windows 8.1 platform with me wherever I go.  I gave an otherwise 4 star product just 1 star simply because Dell doesn't tell you this until you are a wits end and call Dell tech support on the phone. You won't find mention of it on their website. You have to call tech support so verbally break the bad news to you, that you did not buy what you thought you bought.  Dell should put this on the box in big red letters because a consumer wouldn't even think of asking about it because almost every mobile device with a USB charger can be charged with a computer USB port, a car charger, battery back up charger or other generic charger. I'm guessing they do this so you are stuck buying an overpriced replacement charger from Dell.

I did add a 64GB SD Card to help that out but I wish I had bought the 64GB version.\n\nWindows works very well on this unit.  Beware that updating will take awhile and takes up space quickly.  Run the updates then perform a drive clean up including system files.  Google how to if you don't know.  After updating I was left with 4GB of free space.  Of course the update packages took 5GB if not more.  I was able to tweak this thing to have a smaller page file, smaller hibernation file, and after clean up I got things to 10GB free space.\n\nOn my SD Card I set the users \"Pictures\", \"Music\", and \"Videos\" folders to the D: drive and installed Steam for my games.  That works perfectly and allows me to utilize more space.  Not many games from Steam will play with ease on the Dell Venue 8 Pro but some games do play as long as you have an external keyboard and mouse.  Microsoft's Store also has some great games that play on tablets wonderfully.  Asphalt 8 Airborne is one of them.\n\nI totally recommend this tablet with just one condition, get the 64GB version.

But do not buy used or refurbished, unless you have no use for the Microsoft Office 2013 programs.  This suite is only offered for first buyers of the tablet and only for non-commercial use.  I don't know how they can enforce this stated use restriction, but the question is moot to those who purchase used tablets.  It's just not there and cannot be downloaded from Microsoft unless purchased separately.\n\nThe 32 GB model would be okay, but only if an appropriate sized mini SD card  is installed  (Those little cards cost a lot more than the regular SD cards.), or if one can accept the limitations of  available memory."}

I even connected a Bluetooth keyboard to it, so I feel like I have an entire windows computer in my hand (minus the space to put large games like Skyrim on it.) My only problem is that the touch screen is a little bit too sensitive. I am really enjoying this tablet and I am very happy with my purchase.\nUpdate:\nAfter several months of owning this tablet I am still glad I purchased it. It has a fairly long battery life. I have some complaints now, mostly mild an not enough to change my grade.\n1. The storage space. I didn't think it would bother me so much but I'm having trouble saving things to the AD card, and window updates alone are consuming most of the internal storage space.\n2. The sound. That's probably the worst part of this tablet, without ear buds in, it's really hard to hear, like in a silent room, and volume on max, you have to focus really hard to hear anything.\nThe tablet is still fast, convenient and almost makes up for my broken laptop. I liked this tablet so much I even got an expensive Dell PC so I could play my games again, while the Dell venue 8 gives me to portability of a laptop. Very happy with this purchase.\nAll in all though for the price of this tablet it is definitely worth it. You can't have everything for a $200 tablet, but this tablet will get you a lot. I think it is worth the price and the purchase."}

Played with it for one more day and returned it.\n\nBiggest issue- the USB port.  The device comes with a micro USB port for charging and data transfers, as most tablets and phones do.  However Dell has chosen to install a Micro Type A port (which is rectangular) rather than the more modern Micro Type B port (which has a trapezoidal shape).  I believe this is why the device will not charge through any computer or laptop USB port that I tried.\nDell also sends you a cord for the trapezoid shaped type B port, which will work for charging with the wall wort that came with the device.  Why was the manufacturer unable to build the device AND provide you with the matching USB cord.\nHere's the best part.  When I plugged my Dell tablet into a computer or laptop, not only did it not charge, the computer did not recognize it was even attached! I tried it on several computers and ...nothing!  I guess you won't be pulling files off or putting them on this tablet by plugging it into a computer.\n\nDigitizer Pen- two frustrating things about this if you are using the digitizer.  First, you lose some touch screen functions.  You cannot swipe down a page, you MUST find the small scroll bar on the side using you pen.  Second, the pen uses AAAA (4A) batteries which I've never seen before and I worry they'll be hard to find.\n\nKeyboard- it's Bluetooth, but cramped, which I expected.  The bad thing too is that it isn't rechargeable, it uses two button batteries.  More shopping for obscure batteries."}

As it has been my experience with Microsoft over twenty years, everything they do is never completely smooth and obviously a schizophrenic dual user interface (desktop and apps) could not be worse. A Few examples:\n\nI had my app for the economist magazine on Ipad, Iphone, Android and Windows phone and it always worked well, but on this guy, I go to table of contents and I press sections but it does not go there, even after reinstalling several times.\n\nThe desktop view is not optimized for tablets so everything is tiny, and after fiddling with endless menus to try to find a solution. You increase the size fonts and they become readable but you the windows loose its sizing completely and some of them you can only see half.\n\nAnd it goes on...some pages you can zoom in by spreading two fingers, some not. Many apps that ran smoothly on Android, Ios or Windows mobile even don't run smooth here.\n\nIt is in short it a compromise between having a full on dedicated tablet OS and having a full Windows computer OS and Apps...neither working completely well.\n\nI love the tiles solution and I think it is genius, but I know I'll have to wait a long time for Dell and Microsoft to work out all the kinks well."}

Only thing I noticed was this paper near the USB port. Having bought 3 of these, I know that piece of paper isn't supposed to be there. Makes you think the unit is refurbished but due to the packaging and software activating properly, it more likely was Q.C. slip up. I was also able to get a great deal at ~250USD for this.\n\nProduct Experience:\nIt does not have a true GPS, it rather uses the wifi and backtracking to find your location, called aGPS. The screen isn't really workable in middle of the day, outdoor environment. The audio is loud, and pretty clean. If you look around, you will find services and way to expand the memory and add a GPS into the unit.\n\nFor those of you in the fence between Asus VivoTab Note 8 and Dell Venue 8 Pro\nCompared to the Asus VivoTab Note 8:\nWell, I bought both and found the stylus response of the Asus to be less accurate and slower than the Dell V8P. Now, some might say this is due to the active (Dell) and passive (Asus) stylus. I tested the Asus with my Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Stylus (Passive) and the response was much faster than the provided Asus Stylus. Since both the Note 3 and Note 8 use Wacom technology, it seems to me that the filtering is slower on the Asus. The Asus also runs much cooler. During the O/S updates and installing the  applications, I found the asus was cool enough to touch, while the DV8P got too hot at times. I later installed the Dell Bios A05 update and it does not longer seem to get as hot. The asus doe have built in GPS which is nice for those time without wifi aGPS, however the software on windows is awful for maps. The Asus glass screen is a little larger than the Dell. About 4mm wider and 3mm taller. Not a big issue, but cases aren't compatible even though they look the same."}

For the longest of time, ever since I have had a windows computer, and then the android tablets came out, I have wanted to see a windows based tablet. Well the year came when that happened, I think it was with an Hp slate? Non the less, windows was starting to come out in tablet form. Well I needed a new computer, and really wanted a tablet, however money was a bit tight. This is last years model, however it comes with the latest atom, and by my standard, for internet, netflix, youtub, minecraft, light gaming, and networking, this thing is great. It is every thing i could have wanted in a tablet. I just get excited every time I use it. For the money, it cant be beat, and it come with the great name of dell on the back, along with their support and amazing product standards. If you want to have lots of movies, files or whatever on the device itself, go for the 64 gb, cause after windows, you are left with a little less than 10gb for storage. Though this was not an issue for me, cause of the micro sd card slot, so you can add 128gb or more. This thing is great. Oh and if you want to use it as a full computer, get the Plugable USB 2.0 Dock, it will work. The only think i wish it had was usb 3.0 for higher band with. but it is an amazing windows beast. Go DELL. Peace"}

Okay, sure, there is a hardware problem, apparently, with the charging. I'm not familiar with this so I can't talk personally, because the one I used worked perfectly fine. Other than that, which could be caused by people treating these machines with a lack of care, it is a perfect miniature PC. You can use it for your personal office suite, play MMO's all day, even high quality games, and pretty much anything else you want. Social surfing is a breeze, as well as writing reviews and blogging. For the price it is unbeatable. I highly reccomend it. For safety, use caution as far as warranties go because charging is apparently a reoccurring issue. You can download any foreign file without having to use a marketplace, so people complaining about Microsoft not having enough apps, search the web. You can do that with this one, and download any file. -gasp- Sarcasm. I give 5 stars for exactly what it is. Not comparing it to other systems, which isn't the point of a review. Good job Dell."}

The number 1 thing I would reccommend is that currently the 64gb version is only $20 more...Get it.  It's really a shame they even offer a 32gb version.  I downloaded 4 games and google chrome.  I had 1.5gb left before i did a disk clean up.  About 3.5 GB after.  I have not had a chance yet to get a SD card which is a must.  I've heard you can set it to install programs to the SD card instead of the built in memory.\n\nI've had no issues with the touch screen or wireless connectivity.  None whatsoever.\n\nIf you are a person that is \"app\" minded this is probably not for you.  The apps portion of windows 8 is really just an overblown start menu.  And yes there are few apps that apple or android have.  I was able to download a couple free games. six guns and airborn asphalt 8.  Good graphics and not worthless games solely trying to get your money.  They are but you can play without spending a dime.\n\nI needed something SMALL to travel with but also had some functionality if I wanted work on a presentation or spreadsheet on the plane or at the airport, etc.  Office 2013 is already installed!  Can't beat that.  You need the code that is in the box!  Don't throw that away.\n\nI said I didn't have any othe issues that some have described with windows 8 or the Dell Venue but I also downloaded all the updates to firmware and software that were available on Dell's support page.  There is a a tile on the start page to help with that.\n\nAlso I paired this with a IR mouse (logitech), micro usb to regular usb adapter, and a bluetooth keyboard case.  The keyboard is removable so it makes it easy to use with a playstation or some other device.  No you do not have the cool open close functionality of the surface.  I like this case and keyboard for travel.  Two changes I would make is get a bluetooth mouse instead of IR so when using a flash drive  the port is free.  I already had the mouse so just went with it.  Also I would prefer another case to use around the house when not traveling.  Something sleeker with a stand/strap.\n\nI did take note of the square usb/charging port and how the cord needs to be oriented to plug in correctly as some have said they have bent pins because of forcing it in the wrong way.  Just FYI.\n\nFor business type people or someone that is not necessary an app person and wants a little more functionality this is pretty darn cool.  I was able to search for wireless printer and print in no time.  I know it's not that easy on Android, don't know about iPad."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I love technology and gadgets but there can come a time where I feel \"over gadgeted.\" Sometimes less is actually more. I have a Windows Phone, Surface Pro 2 (Surface Pro 3 on the way) and a desktop PC. All have their functions and serve me well. So why would I need an 8\" Windows tablet when I get those features in the Surface Pro 2 and to an extent, my Windows Phone? I can't answer that really but I've found the Venue 8 Pro to be surprisingly useful and productive.\n\nThe Venue Pro 8 is a full PC It has the latest Intel Atom processor and it has proven to be snappy and up to the task at whatever I have thrown at it. I've installed Visual Studio 2013 and it runs great and not as slow as expected. I've even tried Steam and loaded Skyrim and while needing low settings, it worked well enough in a pinch to play a full desktop game. Other older games, like from GOG.com worked great though you do need a keyboard and mouse for 95% of these games.\n\nThe device is an absolute joy to use in portrait mode. The latest Windows 8.1x updates have greatly improved portrait mode use and I find myself using it the majority of the time for reading, browsing and other consumption use. I've even used it via VPN/Remote desktop and it scales my servers to portrait mode in Remote Desktop and I can't say enough how useful it has been.\n\nI was also quite surprised at how productive I could be without using a Bluetooth keyboard or mouse. Microsoft Office 2013 (included, in Home/Student edition) handles the differences between touch and keyboard/mouse quite well. I did some light editing of Word documents with ease and copying and pasting from PDF files (using READER) and it all was quite easy to do. The aforementioned Remote Desktop works great and I find that I don't have a lot of problems with the desktop, though sometimes hitting minimize or the X is not terribly easy.\n\nI also have the optional stylus and if you are thinking of getting it, do know you need to use your My Dell program and download the firmware updates for both the tablet and the screen before you use it. It is not a good experience without the updates. Coming from the Surface Pro 2, I can say the stylus experience on the Venue Pro 8 is OK. But if this is your only tablet and option, then I can recommend the additional expense.\n\nThe screen is quite clear and vibrant though sometimes small text is hard to read, at least with my eyes. Sound is VERY impressive and better than other tablets I've seen costing hundreds more.\n\nYou will want to get the 64GB model for sure. The 32 GB model, even if you backup and remove the recovery drive, doesn't leave you with much space. You can install desktop apps on a MicroSD card (directly or via mount point) but the C drive is essential for a lot of operations of the tablet. I've moved over SkyDrive to the MicroSD but it doesn't seem to run as well. Also, Windows Store seems to have a lot of \"cache space\" when you download and install apps. You recover it after some time or a reboot. But I can't stress enough, go for the 64GB model .\n\nI've connected other Micro USB devices to this (including as Micro USB to USB adapter) and all have performed quite well.\n\nI've had no real problems with it. I've heard of issues with the micro USB port and charging problems. I've had none of that. I have had \"modern\" apps not respond quite a bit. You get their splash screen and then nothing happens. A reboot (sometimes several) seems to take care of that. I also got the blue screen of death (friendlier in Windows 8 with at least a frown face) when starting the camera app but rotating to landscape mode before it finished loading. But no real show killers with the device.\n\nI may be convinced that even with nifty devices like the Surface Pro 3, there may be a place for 8 inch tablets in your life. I can highly recommend the Dell Venue 8 Pro 64GB."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "For work purposes I have to purchase/experiment with/work with many types of tech products. I bought this for a few reasons: I had never even touched a tablet with Windows 8 - only Apple, Android and Chrome. Next came the price - Under $200. And lastly - it includes Microsoft Office. That sealed the deal. Setup was almost the same as setting up a Windows 8 PC. One of the main differences: When I connected to my WiFi network, it picked up my WiFi printer and was ready to print without any further adjustment or input.\n\nI have dealt with between 100 and 200 PCs with Windows 8/8.1 - the majority of the owners I work with (mostly aged in their 50's and up) want their new computer to look and feel like their previous XP/Vista/7. I include myself in that group as I use Windows 8.1 on a desktop as my main computer. I rarely use \"apps\". I don't have a touch screen. I use a mouse and a keyboard. Old-school to a point. I found while using the tablet that window 8 really is a great OS in the right circumstance. Basically, this tablet is a full PC in a compact form. The OS and the touch screen go great together, and, like my desktop, I can switch between the new 8 and the traditional desktop. Although I bought a case with a Bluetooth keyboard, I find I prefer using the touch screen.\n\nA new user will have to get familiar with saving/transferring files in a different manner. As others have stated, you can use an adapter to connect a USB drive. The other option is buying a micro card for the included slot, or upload to \"the cloud\" (or as I call it, 'a huge warehouse crammed full of servers waiting to be hacked'.)\n\nIn short - if you like Windows and want a small computer to take along with you, I would not hesitate to recommend this tablet. Of course emphasis is on the \"small\". My advice to anyone is to shop around in a \"real\" store and have a hands-on experience. You can test drive it physically for hand and eye comfort. Personally - this and all tablets are good for limited-time use. For me, they are too small to use all day.\n\n(PS - I am an open-minded user of technology - I am not stuck on one OS or the other. I use what I need for the specific job)\n\nUPDATE: I have since updated it to Windows 10 with no problems. Additionally, as I really didn't use it often, I sold it for$150 and the new owners loves it.\n\nPjP"}

Was using an iPad Mini and when I tried to replicate its apps on the Dell, I quickly discovered Microsoft truly does have only a fraction of those that Apple has.  But I was able to get a few of the ones I used the most and I've learned to live without the others (Apple has a ton of apps, but it seems 90% of them are games, which don't appeal to me).  As for the tablet itself, the quality and build is impressive.  It has a great feel to it; really like the soft-feel finish on the back.  Screen is just as good as my iPad, which is very good.  Was concerned that its Atom processor wouldn't be fast enough, but it is.  With programs, it's slower than my desktop PC of course, but not horribly slower.  And it's plenty fast running apps.  All the motions are smooth with no jerkiness.  It's noticeably heavier than the iPad.  And it uses up its battery faster.  I do wish there were more apps for it, but since it's a full-featured PC, it'll do so much more than an iPad.  Maybe the newness will wear off, but for now, my iPad's collecting dust.\n\nFollow-up...  A few more weeks using the Dell and the iPad's still collecting dust.  Caveat; if you're planning on buying Dell's stylus, think again.  Doesn't work well at all.  But you have to have something for those tiny Win8 icons; the touchscreen just doesn't do it on these small tablets.  I found the solution, a Logitech T630 mouse.  Tiny and accurate; a perfect match.  Something else to carry around, but it's so tiny you hardly care."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "This tablet is absolutely phenomenal,  I got this tablet for about $80 through Dell's website with a student deal and I absolutely love it.  The reason I got this tablet was so that I wouldn't have to lug around my 13 pound Alienware laptop to take notes in class. While I expected this to be a smaller version of my netbook (basically a typewriter), I was blown away by its power, portability, and especially its battery life. The Windows 8.1 interface is flawlessly integrated into this tablet, giving it superior functionality and convenience, even for those who are not so computer savvy. The 8 inch screen is beautiful and while it could stand to be a little brighter in the sun, it is the perfect size for productivity and portability. While this tablet is small, don't let that fool you as to how powerful it truly is. This tablet can stream 1080p Netflix without a hitch, even when using a USB docking station to extend onto a second screen. That's right, you heard me, this tablet has dual screen support, and with Windows 8.1's snap function, it is able to run 5 apps simultaneously while in the dual screen configuration (tablet can run 2 on its display). I frequently put House on the tablets monitor while I write or browse the web on the big screen the Venue 8 Pro doesn't even stutter. Another amazing point of this tablet is its battery life. I have been browsing the web and streaming Netflix with dual screens for 7 hours now and my battery is still at 26%. On a standard day of browsing, reading with Kindle, and taking notes, I usually don't even hit 50% by the end of the day.  I will warn you of a couple of things though, the SSD, while advertised at 32GB, has a free space of about 11GB fresh out of the box. I recommend adding a micro SD card (I use a 16GB, tablet supports up to 128GB) and changing some settings so that all of your media saves there.  Also, if you do not update the drivers through Dell, expect to have wifi connectivity issues as well possibly having long charge times (upwards of 11 hrs).  If you install the drivers yourself or even have Dell's fantastic support remote in and do it for you, all of those problems will disappear. Overall I love this tablet, and heck, pick up a Targus USB dock, a micro USB B to female USB adapter, and a ISVO Keybook (must have), and make this your primary PC.  While it won't run high end games or CAD, if you simply want to be able to make a powerpoint while on Skype with a friend, watch movies while you slog through spreadsheets, or even play Minecraft on the go, and you want it all in a slim package that will ride in your cargo pocket, this is absolutely the device for you."}

But, it was all to change when having this great tablet by Dell. Very good design, it was like having my currently Windows 8 that was in my laptop in this 8'' display with all the compability i was looking for. Nice camera, all my apps were sincronized from the beginning, i could select any of my devices to obtain all my profile. This tablet is fast enough with its 2 GB RAM, I was looking for a price drop and finally I got it. What is more interesting is that I can plug any USB with my OTG and connect all my devices, inluding a CLARO 4G/LTE modem to transform this little treasure in a connected PC all the time. At home the WIFI is pretty fast and all my apps were updated without problem. It would be cool if amazon could sell the red one to give my wife as a present.

I love the fact that I can put Steam, Teamspeak, Virtual Clone Drive, and other \"desktop\" applications that I use all the time on here, and run them just like I would on my full tower. I can actually be productive on the go with programming in Visual Studio, image editing with GIMP, or using Office. One caveat: Refurbs don't come with Office, so be ready to pay/have your own ready.\nThis little baby has impressive power, and runs all the programs I've thrown at it like a champ. I don't think it would fair well with say, Planetside or Rome Total War 2, but it'll handle most mid 2000's and older games no problem.\nThe quality of the camera isn't spectacular, but I don't think of tablets as being for taking great pictures anyways. I'm fairly impressed with the sound quality that comes out of the little side speaker, which doesn't get tinny even at reasonable loudness levels. Screen is bright and 1280x800 size has plenty of definition and is supported by most programs (yay!).\nOther impressive thing is battery. Installing programs intensively for the first few days, I didn't have to charge it for at least 8 hours, maybe more.

The problem is that there is absolutely no way to synchronize Outlook between this tablet and another computer.  The Venue Pro's micro-USB port can not be used to transfer data!  That is a major problem.  The only way to share data is using Skydrive/Onedrive which involves copying files from the PC to the cloud storage and then downloading it from the cloud to the tablet.  But, as soon as the files are copied, they are already out-of-date.\n\nThe second major problem with the Venue 8 Pro is that the wireless adapter cannot hold a wi-fi connection if the tablet goes to sleep.  It then requires the wi-fi connection to be disconnected and reconnected.  I tried half a dozen fixes for this problem that I found on Dell's web-site but none of them is a permanent fix.

When I saw Dell's new 8\" color tablet - with Windows 8.1 and basic Microsoft Office included at a price not much more than the included software, I decided it was time to give it a try. I'm happy with Windows 7 on my laptop and desktop and am resigned that at some point I had to learn the new Windows 8.1  version.  This sounded like a way to get through the learning curve without risking mission-critical applications and my livelihood.  I'm glad I did.  At work, it slips into my portfolio to use at meetings with business applications I am familiar with.  At home, I keep it next to my chair (to look up answers to questions that come up in conversation or TV) or next to my bed (to read books from Kindle or the Library). I'm learning the new Windows 8.1 quirks and hiding places for common functions without the stress I had with previous updates.  Once I'm comfortable, I can consider updating the computers at the office.\n\nThe Dell itself has a very readable screen, good battery life, and it was easy to add another 32 GB with a micro SD card.  One issue is failure to hold shift consistently and double keying when entering my password to wake it up.  I've learned to watch carefully to make sure capital letters stay capital and listen to make sure I hear only one click per character.  The case material is nice to hold comfortably without slipping out of my hand when reading at night.

They were advertised as the perfect business and leisure companion. After reading online reviews for few weeks I decided to buy the Dell Venue 8 Pro and would like to give my personal review.\n\nLook and size\nThe Dell Venue 8 Pro is an 8 inch tablet with fairly average size and weight. with 9 mm of thickness and about 400 g of weight is slightly thicker and heavier than an iPad Air (7.5 mm and 330 g) or Samsung Galaxy Note 8 (7.95 mm and 340 g). I really doubt you would notice the difference unless you hold it for a very long time.\n\nThe Venue 8 Pro comes in black color but if you buy it from Dell website you can also find a red version for the same price.\n\nSoftware\nThe real value of this tablet it that it gives you the full power of Windows 8.1 and Office (not the RT version). Windows OS has two levels:\nthe Metro UI level is the new interface for mobile users that I find fast, colorful and easy to use. I like the live tiles although most Android widgets are more useful. With a swipe up you access the list of all apps, some will open straight away while some will open in desktop version much like a normal PC\nthe PC level is a typical desktop that allows to use Office and other applications made for standard computer\nSwitching from these two levels is quite fast but it may become annoying. Moreover, if you plan to use it for professional reasons consider that many companies are not yet ready to support Windows 8. As a consequence there might be limitations with email app, security, network printing, etc.\n\nThe Venue 8 Pro includes Office Home and Student 2013 edition making a great deal for less than 300$. I got the Professional edition of Office and it works very well with this tablet.\n\nIf you really miss your Android apps you can install Bluestacks. BlueStacks version of Android runs from within Windows, allowing it access to PC hardware including cameras, accelerometers or gyroscopes, and to the Windows file system.\n\nConnectivity\nThe Venue 8 Pro has Dual-band WiFi and Bluetooth 4.0 connectivity; the version with 3G SIM slot will cost additional 100$ (or 100). I use my Android smartphone for wifi or USB tethering when I'm traveling and it's pretty fast.\n\nScreen\nThe Venue 8 Pro has an IPS Display with HD (WXGA 1280 x 800) resolution that has similar specs to the Galaxy Note 8 but very far from the quality of the retina display (2048-by-1536 resolution at 326 pixels per inch).

I've got no idea what people are on about with the touch screen or connectivity problems (I updated Windows and had no problems). It's a nice solid device. Windows does a pretty good job at rendering web pages - very smooth browsing. Netflix loads fast. NY times app works nicely and it's pleasant reading. Also, I was under the impression that desktop mode would be useless in this form-factor, but it's not. I was really impressed.\n\nIt does get a little warm when using it heavily, but I remind myself that there is a general-purpose processor in this thing, not a customized micro-controller on steroids. Maybe not a big deal for most users, but I find it super awesome that a general-purpose processor is performing so efficiently under workloads that ARM based processors are specifically customized for.\n\nCons:\nI do wish it was a little lighter. And the major problem with Windows 8 is the shortage of Metro apps. And allot of those that do exists are hacky third party ones (e.g. youtube), which I don't know if I want to long onto. No official GMail app. even the Amazon app seems like its skimming the webpage.\nAlso if you intend on using this outdoors, polarized sunglasses completely block the screen. I have no similar problem with my IPhone and IPad screens."}

Unfortunately, I've had too many problems to be happy with it.\n\nOn a Saturday in mid-March (only had it two and a half months) I turned it on and it indicated that it couldn't find any wireless networks.  I assumed our router needed to be re-booted so I did that.  Still nothing.  Then I realized it wasn't recognizing any of the other local wireless networks in the neighborhood.  I ran the little troubleshooter thing and found this message:  The Dell Wireless 1538.802.11 a/g/n Adapter adapter is experiencing driver- or hardware-related problems.\n\nI am not very technical so I started an online chat with Dell support.  Their response was:  I do apologize but we do have a separate department that handles all wireless or bluetooth issues/concern and wireless/bluetooth cards replacements. They can help you troubleshoot/diagnose the issue, they can also replace the parts if needed. I do apologize but its beyond our scope of support. Its best to call them since they don't have a chat team.\n\nThey provided me with a phone number to call, so I did that.  It took about two hours (my cell phone battery died so I had to switch to another phone mid-conversation... not that it pertains to this issue, but it was frustrating).  In the end I think they said I needed an updated driver.  It was interesting because I didn't have internet access.  They had me uninstall something and then re-install and I forget whatever else.  I did write some notes at the time but after they got me running again I didn't think to keep the notes.  I wish I had.\n\nNow it is mid-May and I'm having the same problem again.  I called the number again and after being transferred once I finally got to talk to someone.  I gave them my old service reference number in hopes they would have the issue documented.  But it didn't come across that way.  While the service people were very nice, there was a bit of a language barrier to overcome (needing to spell words, repeat numbers, etc.).  I really do think the service people know what they're doing, but I don't.  It's been very stressful and frustrating for me.  This time the service person kept saying that I needed to download a new driver.  But I don't have an internet connection so I don't know how to do that.  The service person said that I needed to plug in a flash drive, but I don't see where this tablet has a flash drive port (or whatever you call it).  So I was very confused and really getting stressed out.\n\nThe service person said they would send me an e-mail with a description and picture the part I need to go and buy in order to plug in to the tablet so I can download a new driver and then install it on the tablet.  I am really tired of this now.\n\nI want so badly to like this tablet.  When it works, I do like it.  But now it's two times in five months that this driver problem has occurred.  And face it, without wireless this just isn't what I bought into.  Maybe this is just how these things work... you have to expect to work on them a bit.  But I just want a product that works.  It will probably take me a week or so before this is resolved.  I'm just stressed and frustrated."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I've used many iPads and Tablets before, I've even used a Windows 8 Samsung tablet, but this Venue is by far the best tablet I've ever used. Here is a list of pros and cons I found with the venue pro vs the other tablets I've used:\n\nPROS:\n-Form Factor. 8\" hits the sweet spot. I figured this out ever since using the iPad Mini and how nice it felt vs a full 10\" size.\n-Build Quality. Thin and sturdy, grippy rubber and no plastic.\n-Screen Quality. It's not 1080p but it is and IPS display. I wouldn't want a 1080p screen on this anyways because Windows 8 still has problem scaling in desktop mode and the Atom CPU/GPU probably wouldn't handle as fast on a full HD display.\n-Full Windows. Don't complain about the lack of apps in the Windows Store because you have the entire collection of apps on the internet at your disposal.\n-Gaming. I loaded Hearthstone and League of Legends on it. Both ran great!\n-Battery Life. Seems to last all day as long as you're not gaming.\n-MiniUSB. It uses the same charging cable as many other smartphones and tablets, which I think is a very big plus so I won't have to worry about different chargers.\n\nCONS:\nBezel. After using the iPad mini and LG G Pad, I fell in love with their super thin bezels. The Venue's bezels aren't thick, but they aren't thin either.\nOverheats. When playing long sessions of Hearthstone, the backside of the tablet starts heating up. One side of the tablet would be cool and one side would be warm.\nGlitches. Sometimes when I leave it sleeping for a while, it wouldn't turn back on. I would have to hold the power button down until it shuts down, then press it again to power up.\n\nOverall, this is a great tablet. My experience with iOS and Android tablets have been very disappointing because their phone counterparts can do the same things, and oftentimes I don't use the tablets because it's much more convenient to use my phone.\n\nIf you're someone who only wants to consume media (Netflix, youtube, ebooks, etc), then get an Android/iOS tablet, otherwise, go for this Venue."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "After looking at various tablets to replace my ancient slow, dual-core iPad 2 from 2011, I decided to go with this. I am tired of these slow, low power ARM processors that begin to fall behind after a year. That's why I hope ARM doesn't take over the world like a lot of people are speculating. I just don't think it's quite ready. I decided to go with an x86 tablet as soon as I discovered they existed! I thought I was stuck with using ARM and a restricted OS that only relied solely on apps and were very conservative about multitasking.\n\nOne thing I love about Dell is that no matter how old one of their machines/devices are, they always include a service tag. That's always been a useful thing about their products. Anyway, onto the tablet itself.\n\nWhen I opened the box, the tablet was of perfect size. I have pretty big hands, and this fit them perfectly. It's a nice, sleek, professional design and isn't made of cheap plastic, either. The design is nice, feels right in your hand and has all of the features a tablet needs! The volume buttons are there and the home (or Windows key) button is there. Everything my iPad had, but just in a different place, which did require some getting used to but not much. You can also plug any USB device into it as well. It has a Micro USB port on it, so you'll need to buy a USB to Micro USB adapter. Search for them here on Amazon. They cost next to nothing.  The onboard Intel SST audio chip isn't bad either! I running some SOL Republic Amps HD earphones and everything sounds great! I don't play games, but I watch a lot of YouTube and listen to music quite frequently and the sound is crisp and clear when listing to FLAC and 320 Kbps MP3 files.\n\nHaving a USB is extremely useful. I can transfer files, plug my wireless keyboard in and do whatever else I need to do while I'm on the go, or more frequently, in bed because I'm too lazy to get up and use my desktop. ;) It also comes with a Micro SD port. 32 GB isn't a whole lot, especially when that behemoth sized Windows 8 takes up 21 gigs (leaving you only 11 gigs at your disposal). I bought a 16 gig Micro SD card and it's like adding another hard drive to your PC. Same idea, but a lot cheaper. ;) You can also find those on Amazon. Kingston is a reliable brand.\n\nThe Venue's battery life is okay, but you have to charge it everyday. My iPad was able to hold a charge for weeks before I had to charge it again. I don't know if the battery just isn't as great or if Windows 8 consumes a lot of it. That's something I haven't bothered researching quite yet. That's a major con for me. I wish the battery life was better. But it will last for a whole day if you plan to be out.\n\nLet me reiterate x86 instruction set I mentioned earlier. This tablet comes with Windows 8. I refuse to use this OS on my desktop, but for a tablet, it's quite nice. I'll go into that later. Given that it comes Windows, you can run any application that your Windows desktop or laptop can run! Anything from flash games to TurboTax or even older video games with less system requirements will run on this! Talk about backwards compatibility and open ended, you've got it! Some desktop applications won't be exactly easy to work with assuming you're using the touch screen. But hey, it freakin' works! And I like that!\n\nI'm also happy with the direction Dell decided to take while choosing not to install any of that annoying bloatware you often get with a prebuilt system. I was afraid that as soon as I got this, I was going to have to figure out a way to wipe the whole OS and reinstall it because it would be so bogged down with adware and bloatware that many companies choose to load on PCs (no wonder the PC gets so much criticism for being slow, clunky and unreliable.)\n\nWindows 8 takes a little getting used to, but I guarantee it's a lot easier than trying to learn it with a keyboard and mouse, which is a debacle I refuse to become a victim of. When listening to music or doing something of that nature, pressing the sleep button (turns your screen off) will stop all applications from running. I need to figure out how to stop that, but I fear that it will drain the battery even more.\nAnyway, you've got your desktop and even the marketplace, which doesn't have many apps to choose from but depending on what you're looking for, you might find it. I don't exactly understand why Microsoft decided to throw some apps with the Xbox name on them. My tablet is not an Xbox and the apps aren't at all related to it. Is that a marketing gimmick? I don't understand the deal behind that.\n\nA lot of people these days seem to think the PC is on its way out and tablets like these are replacing them entirely, and I have to shamefully admit that I fell into that belief for some time until I realized just how inconvenient that would be. I have a custom built desktop, an HP laptop, two tablets and a smartphone and I use these all in conjunction. My desktop is the center of everything. It's where I play my games and do a majority of my typing and just simply playing around on. I and anyone I know has no intention to replace their desktop or laptop with their phone or tablet. That ideology is completely ridiculous and will never make sense to me why tech journalists spew that. The most important thing is that everything has its use! I like my tablet and I use it regularly, but it's not a replacement to anything.\n\nNow that I've gotten that out of the way, I highly recommend this tablet! It's by far the greatest one I've used!\nMain selling points: Windows/x86, USB, fast quad core Intel processor, decently priced, and let's not forget...Dude, you're getting a Dell!"}

I had it in my over-sized pockets and knelt down to pick up my 2 year old, the screen shattered in my pocket from the corner of the screen.\n\nThe second time, I was sitting at home with it inside a brand new case that was suppose to keep it from breaking.  It was on a TV tray (fastened closed) no more than 2ft. from the floor and slid. it landed sideways and stood up on end so I thought it was fine, once I opened the case, again, smashed from the same corner and the tablet didn't even touch the ground or come lose from the case.\n\nFor some reason the charging port area is a real big weak spot for the tablet and as it turns out that touch screen is the whole tablet.

I know, I know, that's a feature, but in reality it makes it difficult with my fat fingers to accurately select the right item many times, and it gets a bit frustrating.

I put tablet in quotations because, although it has tablet controls and does whatever a windows tablet can do, it also has full Windows 8.1 and can do whatever a basic laptop can do as well. For this reason, the versatility of this thing amazes me every day I use it. I don't usually write reviews, but I felt especially compelled to do so with this thing due to how happy I am that I bought it. It runs fantastically, I'm able to emulate almost anything a PC can with no issues and run some old games for some small amusement, but where this tablet shines is its quickness and portability. It's very light and fast, making quick little tasks (such as typing an essay or looking something up) a breeze, yet with a simple Bluetooth keyboard, can become a portable workstation as well. I have absolutely no regrets about this purchase and encourage anyone looking for a capable tablet to consider the Dell Venue 8 Pro as an option.\n\nPros: Fast, portable, durable, has SD card slot for expansion, very versatile, technical specs are great for the price (better than an iPad), easy to use, extremely convenient to carry around\n\nCons: SD card slot sometimes gets a little hot when running something off of an SD card, Windows Store doesn't have as many goodies as the Apple store does, but the fact that this thing runs as a PC more than makes up for that."}

Sometimes it worked okay, other times I had to disable and reenable Wi-Fi several times or reboot the tablet several times to get a network connection.

I ordered this in hopes I'd be able to use it for several tasks throughout the day.  I'm a little bit disappointed that I'm unable to hook up an external hard drive to it without having a USB hub.  I'm also disappointed that it doesn't recognize my projector via USB inputs.  I've ordered the plugable 7 port USB (powered) hub and the usb to HDMI converter for such reasons, but it's upsetting that I could have spent the same that I have now and been able to do everything from just the tablet.\n\n32GB is certainly not enough to do much of anything - you need to order a micro SD card when you order this.  There is only about 11GB left on the tablet after the OS.  Without a micro SD card you'll be hard pressed to fit anything on this tablet.\n\nWhen I first got the tablet I was having issues with it charging, after a quick google search I learned about several updates that I needed to do.  I did the recommended updates and also installed the dell battery management app and no longer do I have charging issues from the unit.\n\nOne of the biggest things I hate about this little thing is you cannot hook it up directly to another computer.  It just doesn't recognize being hooked up to another laptop for data transfer.  I tried to do a bluetooth data transfer but I kept losing connection and it just wouldn't complete the transfer.\n\nI haven't had any issues with freezing up or the tablet not doing what I wanted it to do.  It's a speedy little thing and does everything quickly.  I haven't tried to play any games on it so I cannot comment on that.  I've just been using it for small tasks (playing music, working in office, etc) and haven't really put any demand on it.\n\nPros:\n- Windows 8.1 is awesome, I love it (opinionated)\n- Quick\n- Supports Micro SD\n\nCons:\n- Not enough storage (11GB left out of 32GB)\n- Charging issues when first purchased (remedied after updates it seems)\n- Does not connect straight to a laptop for data transfer\n- Does not have enough power to support an external HDD\n- Speaker is terrible\n\nAll in all it's a great little tablet that just needed some extras to make it completely useful:\n- Powered USB hub for external HDD\n- USB to HDMI converter\n- Bluetooth keyboard\n\nIf I were to do it all over again I think I would pick up something a little bit more expensive with possibly an HDMI out."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "The tablet is very nice with pretty solid build quality.  The screen is vibrant and looks good, even with the relatively \"low\" resolution. There is a bit of flex in the tablet frame, but it overall is solid.  I like the rubberized back with concentric rings; very grippy. I'm going to throw a slim case on it just to add some protection since I bring it with me on the bus.  If I used it at home only, I'd be happy using it without a case.  Dell's pre-installed software is minimal, but a bit confusing (I was trying to figure out if I had all the firmware updates installed and I think I do, but not quite sure...).  The 8-inch size is great.  More screen real estate than my old Nexus 7, but not as heavy as dear wife's iPad-2.  It's comfortable to hold in both portrait and landscape, but I, somewhat surprisingly, prefer it in landscape, which is opposite of how I held the Nexus 7 (the biggest benefit of landscape is snapping apps side by side).  Some people have complained about the placement of the Windows start button, but this does NOT bother me at all.  I actually prefer not seeing the glowing white capacitive on the tablet at all times.  Swipe in from the left or the right and you can bounce back to the start screen easily without relying the hardware button.\n\nBut the biggest question for most people looking at the Dell Venue 8 Pro is probably whether or not they want or can tolerate Windows 8.  I'm actually enjoying it overall, but have some relatively minor frustrations.  The ability for true multitasking is great and snapping apps side by side is a killer feature compared with Android and iOS.  Following Twitter in a small column while watching MLB.tv on the rest of the screen is pretty much the greatest thing ever ;) The negative parts of W8 are that the desktop text is too small and there are lots of misclicks when navigating desktop program. Also, the metro app selection isn't great.  A lot of the big name apps are in the Windows store, but not all, and some of the apps lack features compared with iOS or Android.  However, running full Windows 8 does make up for a lot of these missing apps/features because you have access to a full-fledged web browser and can access a lot of stuff that way.  For example, I run several chrome apps in the desktop (Tweetdeck, Google Music), which I prefer to the Metro offerings.  Also, I wish Windows 8 acted more like Windows Phone at times, especially in the metro interface (swype, action center, cursor movement, closer tiles), but that is a matter of preference.\n\nAfter about 2 weeks I'm happy with the Dell hardware and pleasantly surprise (for the most part) with Windows 8.  Hopefully, Microsoft will continue to make improvements to the OS and more apps will keep coming to the Windows store.  After having the flexibility of full Windows, using other tablets seems very limiting."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "While this device works acceptably as a tablet, one of the main reasons I bought it was to do class presentations using miracast and use the stylus to mark up notes on my presentations like an interactive white board. However, it will only extend screen, not duplicate screen, and only in portrait mode, not in landscape. That makes it almost impossible to use for the reason I intended and difficult to use for just about anything else. Keep in mind, this thing does not have any other video access. No HDMI. MIracast is the only way to extend or share the Venue's screen, and it doesn't work. This isn't just my problem, it is an issue discussed on the Dell community site. See link.\n\n[...]\n\nAside from the Miracast issue, the device in desktop mode is very difficult to use without a stylus and/or a mouse and keyboard. This is more an OS issue. The screen in desktop mode is simply too small to be used by finger touch alone, and the stylus (I have the new 'improved' one) isn't really any more accurate than a normal rubber tip tablet or phone stylus, nothing like the one I have on my Galaxy Note. Using it on desktop, it often clicks the wrong thing, so I bought a bluetooth mouse to go with it. It might be more useful if you could plug it into a larger screen, but...\n\nA final suggestion, if you do buy this thing, is to get the 64gb version. The 32gb version came with only about 8gb of free space after OS etc. Now that I have basic software on it, that is more like 5gb. To permanently mount the SD card as a system drive is a bit of a pain and some may not find it easy to do. Without it, the SD card can't be used for apps and such.\n\nBasically, it's a nice toy, but with the crippled miracast and the poor stylus accuracy, it does not serve well as a presentation device, which is what I bought it for. Dell at the above site claims they will fix the miracast issues, but keep in mind it took them six months or so just to get the stylus for this thing working again. At first glance it looks like a super cheap alternative to the Microsoft Surface, but really, it's just super cheap. I suspect that is how Dell views it too."}

Initially over the first couple of weeks I was impressed with this tablet but some things about it started to annoy me.  The touchscreen is not responsive on web pages when trying to press links to other sites.  I found I had to press them multiple times.  When using Onenote, most of the time the camera option didn't even work and the program would crash when I tried adding a photo to a note.  Other times I noticed the tablet just didn't want to turn on from sleep mode.  When pressing the unlock button, an orange light would blink.  I'd leave it alone for a while and it would then work.\n\nThe biggest issue was the wireless stopped working every time windows sent updates.  It would give me a message indicating the wireless network driver had a problem, so I ran system restore and this would work ok for a few days until windows sent another update.  After going through this about five times I finally called Dell tech support, and they had me reset it back to factory settings and told me to change the windows update to not automatically update any longer.  I asked how this fixed the problem and the rep told me it's a common issue as when windows sends the updates, the updates are geared towards PCs and corrupt the wireless driver.  Hmmm ok.  The problem is when he had me reset it, it wiped out the installed Microsoft office software, and I no longer had the product key for it.  By this point I was fed up and I returned it for a refund and I went with an iPad mini, which is what I should have gone with all along.  If you want something reliable, easy and seamless to use, go with an Apple product.  Say what you want about Apple, but I've owned several iPhones and the first generation iPad, and I've never experienced a reliability or functionality issue ever.  Apple products just work, always.\n\nThe issue with the wireless network driver seems to be a common issue.

Why Microsoft didn't come up with an Android/Ipad-esque user interface is surely one of life's many mysteries. You would think that at some time during development someone in management would have taken a look at it and said, \"No! Start over!\". ; and\n2. Seems to run a little hot.\n\nBecause of the build quality, the Android version is probably a nice little tablet.\n\nMaybe someone like Stardock, or even Microsoft, will come up with a UI that's more practical for a small tablet. This will go back in the box until then."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I had found that I did not use my 10\" android tablet at work as often as I thought I would.  It's a latest generation Samsung, and it's great, but it was too big for me to conveniently carry everywhere.  I checked, and most 8\" tablets would fit in my pants pocket.  I started looking, and I ordered this on a whim because Dell was selling a refurb for barely more than the cost of a Microsoft Office home and Student license (which is included).\n\nIt turns out I really like it a lot. I have barely used my larger (and much more expensive) tablet since I got this one.  I have read a lot of reviews from folks who have picked up an iPad mini or similar sized tablets who wind up preferring them to larger ones, and I will echo those thoughts.\n\nBeyond the size, the reason I like it so much (again to my GREAT surprise) is Windows 8.1.  Really.  My family has two modern, powerful touch-screen laptops with Windows 8.1 on them.  I really don't like it in that application.  The \"metro\" (yes, I know that's not its real name, but it seems to be what folks still call it) touch screen interface is just horrible to me on a laptop.  I installed Classic Shell (which brings back the Start menu and boots to desktop mode) on my laptops, which really just about \"fixes\" what most folks hate about Windows 8.1. Still, sometimes you are forced into the metro screen, and it is still annoying.\n\nBUT putting Windows 8.1 on a tablet changes everything.  The metro interface is clearly designed for tablet use, and it really shines there.  As much as I dislike the metro interface on the laptop, on the tablet, it is the desktop interface that is less satisfying.  The metro apps are fast, easy to use with fingers, and it is easy to switch between apps (all of those gestures, charms and swipes that are odd on a laptop now make perfect sense).  Web surfing, game playing and video watching are all as good as on any tablet I've used.  Having the built-in Word and Excel and the ability to run Windows programs are great bonuses (I even installed Civ 5 and played the touch-screen version. It's playable on this tablet, although the wait between turns is longer than on a modern full PC).\n\nEven Internet Explorer (with one caveat) is a pleasure.  The swipe navigation is helpful, intuitive  and easy to use on a tablet.\n\nMicrosoft and Intel made some huge missteps in the launch of Windows 8 and windows tablets.  The first generation's Clover Trail atom processors were just not really up to the task of running a full desktop OS fluidly enough for many users.  The new Bay Trail atom processors are (no, they are not Haswell class, but they are not supposed to be that fast, either).\n\nHaving desktop and laptop users forced into a tablet desktop was also a terrible idea, but it sounds like Microsoft is finally realizing it.  The metro interface being run on a tablet with a powerful enough processor is great.  The Dell's screen is good, and is a pleasure to use.\n\nHere are my nits, but none would deter me from recommending the tablet to a friend:\n\n1.  The windows store is getting better, but it is far behind Google Play, much less Apple's app store in many areas.  I've been able to find an app for most of what I want to do, but the selection is nothing like the other ecosystems.\n\n2. Here is the caveat for Internet Explorer.  Bing is integrated into the search feature.  Yes, you can go to the Google home page to run a search, but it's a pain and I wish Microsoft would let that thing go already.\n\nEdit May 2, 2014:\n\nI just was out of town and tried to use a capacitive stylus to annotate some PDF presentation slides.  You can't do that in the standard viewer app, but there are several apps available from the Windows store for relatively low cost.  I tried a couple, and unfortunately, I found it unworkable.  All I had was (a relatively good) capacitive stylus.  It was horrible.  It skipped so much as to make the annotations pointless.  I've ordered the new version of the active stylus from Amazon, but it's on back order.  I hope it is a lot better."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I purchased the Dell Venue 8 Pro 64 GB tablet directly from Dell at the first of March 2014. I had heard good things about the product and read positive reviews. I had considered buying an iPad, but I have been a long time customer and user of Dell products, so I wanted the tablet to be everything an iPad claimed to be and everything I knew a Windows tablet had the potential for being. Initially I was pleased with the product.\n\nAt some point (about two weeks in), however, I started experiencing problems with the tablet. The onscreen typing became erratic. One keystroke would turn into three or four duplicated characters. At about the same time, the Bluetooth keyboard that I purchased to use with the tablet stopped working with the tablet. It would connect but would not enter text. The keyboard, however, works fine when paired with other devices.\n\nTech support, after several attempts at changing settings, then refreshed the device through Windows recovery options. The problems seemed to disappear, but they came back as soon as Windows updates were loaded. Following that, tech support did a reinstall through Windows recovery options. They also did a firmware update. After these steps, the onscreen keyboard was not quite back to its original out of the box state. It occasionally repeated or missed keystrokes. Now that Windows updates have been loaded, the device is virtually unusable because the onscreen keyboard is so erratic and I cannot get the Bluetooth keyboard to work with it.\n\nTech support had only two options for me: Turn off Windows updates or return the device to be repaired. Neither of these options seem like true fixes to me. It is a security risk to turn off Windows updates, and refurbishing the device to factory settings will be useless once Windows updates are loaded unless the root of the problem is addressed on the engineering side. I tried to get a refund, but Dell was unbending with their 30 day refund policy even though I was within days of the window.\n\nThe offshore based customer service and tech support was horrendous and the return and repair option apparently takes up to two weeks.\n\nUPDATE: I sent a certified letter about this problem to Dell headquarters in Texas addressed to Michael Dell, and I received a phone call within a day or so of them receiving the letter. They did allow me to return the tablet for a refund. This action did restore some of my faith in Dell. Maybe they will spend more time in research and development before they release another half-baked tablet like this one."}

LOL\n\nI researched the heck out of this - BEFORE  I bought it.  I've owned Samsung, iPad, and Kindles in the past.\n\nThe Dell Pro Venue 8 is a real computer packed into an 8 inch tablet.  I hate calling it a tablet, because it's not.  It has Windows 8.1 on it, as well as MS Office/Professional, and a bunch of other stuff I'll never use.  I use this computer as my field system.  Rather than lug around my laptop, I take this with me when I'm working.  I also carry my portable Wi-Fi so I don't have to worry about connecting in public.  I bought the MoKo mini keyboard with case for $29.99 and that setup gives me all I need in the field.\nAfter I finish with appointments, I send my emails and write reports while in the car, or at a restaurant.  I'm always connected with my company.\n\nI just bought a new I5, and it cost approximately $600.  This Dell Pro Venue was less than $250 and does EVERYTHING the laptop can do.  I also can connect to my big monitor at my home office, using a mini USB to HTML adaptor.\n\nAt less than $250, and with the mini keyboard/mouse....I have everything I would have at my desk and I can hold it all in the palm of my hand.\n\nThis system was never marketed the way it should have been...if it had, the iPad would be history."}

This was a gift for my husband, and when he contacted Amazon they were of no help. Of course we are unable to return as the return date was no later than march 27th. I would not recommend this product, and although I used to be a Dell fan, my choice from now on is Apple. I do not recommend this product.

They essentially had to rebuild the entire unit, new drive, screen, processor, everything. All I used it for was general web browsing and an occasional movie. They were great about it all though they sent it back and the the Win 8 license they gave me to set it back up is not working. Dell sends me an OS recovery stick, which has a memory exception error, it arrives AFTER the warranty expires. I call and they say \"well it needs a new motherboard\" though it was just replaced. Since it is \"out of warranty now\" a new motherboard will cost $269 to do, which was more than I paid for the tablet originally. So I bought a $200+ paperweight. Dell sucks, I will never buy a device from them, they are horrible and this tablet never worked well, ever."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "My background on tablets consist of the kindle fire(1st gen), ipad 1, and various android tablets. The thing that sets the dell venue 8 pro apart from the rest is the full windows operating system. Albeit, windows 8 is not like the past windows experiences, but it seems like it was made for tablets. I have windows 8 on my computer, it runs well, but it runs better on my dell venue.\n\nPros:\n-The responsiveness of this tablet is amazing, it is breeze from the going from program to program without any noticeable lag.\n-IE has been optimized for tablets, so internet surfing is as easy and as fast as ever. On PC, I would usually use Chrome, Opera or Firefox. However, Internet Explorer on this tablet it too smooth and user-friendly to ignore.\n-The built-in speakers are nothing to call home about, but they work well for this tablet.\n-Since this tablet runs full windows 8.1 OS, you can install windows programs on it such as the office suite and Steam(for PC games)\nThe PC games that I have got to run on it so far have been Don't Starve, Torchlight 2 and even Skyrim on low settings. However, games like Skyrim will need for you to purchase a usb adapter to plug in an xbox 360 controller to the tablet. Just make sure that you close any other programs that are running so you can get desirable FPS.\n-I usually get 8 hours of battery life, which is better than most of the tablets I have used. Yet, the tablet does lose hours depending how intensive the programs you are running on it are. An example would be Skyrim, which brings the battery life down to 4 to 5 hours, which is to be expected.\n-Micro-sd port makes storage capacity easy to expand. I currently have a 64 gb card in, which installed and runs smoothly.\n-Bluetooth connectivity makes connected a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard a breeze.\n-Screen is very vivid and great for playing HD movies on the go.\n-The build quality for this device is great. For the price it feels as thought you got more for your buck.\n-Booting up takes about 5 seconds.\nCons:\n-Lack of a full usb port requires you to to buy an adapter to plug in the micro usb port.\n-After installing the OS and updates,, you only have about 7-8 GBs left on the 32gb version of the Dell Venue 8 pro.\n-OS interface takes a while to get used to if you are new to Windows 8. This is more of a con with the OS than the tablet.*\n-Cannot charge other devices through usb port adapter. There is a workaround for this, but requires a modded usb adapter.\n-The camera quality(both front and back) is pretty poor. The front camera works fine for Skype, but don't expect anything more. the back camera seems to be on par with a flip phone camera.\n-The windows home button is located on the top right of the device, making it a very odd and confusing decision on dells part.\n-Screen seems to be a magnet for finger prints, however they are unnoticeable when the screen is on.\n\nOverall, this is my favorite tablet and I use it all the time to type up documents, watch shows and movies, search the web and play video games. I'm actually writing this review on it. The specs for this tablet are great compared to the price, I got my Venue 8 pro from the dell's scratch and dent program for $150, so I think I got a real bargain. It's basically having a full blown computer in your hand. The gaming aspect is perfect for me since I cannot bring my PC on the go with me. Obviously, it can't play the latest an greatest games, but getting Skyrim running on a tablet is just simply amazing to me. For a full windows tablet at this price, nothing comes close in my opinion. Do yourself a favor and check it out."}

The second is a 5\" Samsung media player with android I bought to replace my PDA.  (I am still trying to get by without a smartphone and data plan.)  Each tablet filled a niche.  The 10\" was great for surfing and browsing media.  The 5\" was my always-on, take it everywhere device.  I kept thinking it would be great to drop down to one device and started looking at the 7\" & 8\" tablets.  A friend was into windows tablets and after using this I agree that it is more like having a full computer in you hand.  With the IVSO keyboard case, it feels like an 8\" laptop.  It fits nicely on my treadmill bookstand and the screen is big enough to watch a movie.  If I can find a coat and a jacket with oversized pockets, it may become my go everywhere device.  Meanwhile, it handles like a 5.5\" x 8\" day planner (actually a little lighter and more compact).  It came with Office.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "While most tablets are made for consuming media (watching movies, playing basic games, and viewing web pages), this tablet can be used as a full computer. This is because it is an actual Windows 8.1 PC. If you are looking for a PC that is very portable, low-cost and has excellent battery life, then this is an excellent choice. If you are mainly looking for a device for convenient light media consumption, then a Kindle Fire or other Android tablet would be a better choice in this price range.\n\nOn the positive side, this device is an actual PC that runs Windows 8.1. While it has only 2 GB of RAM, limited storage and an Atom processor, it does run the included Office for Home and Students just fine. You can also install other Windows programs, although I would strongly suggest getting a micro SD card for the other programs since storage space is very limited. You might also find a program like SymMover ([...]) useful-this program allows you to move programs and folders from the C drive to removable media (this is especially useful for some programs that insist on being installed only on the boot drive).\n\nThe screen is quite nice, although the high resolution means that you will need good eyesight to take full advantage of it. The sound is also good, especially for a tablet. I did not get a stylus, so I cannot comment on that. However, I found the touch feature to work just fine. Be sure to get the latest bios and updates from Dell, however.\n\nOn the minus side, the device has no video-out ports. As such, it would not be usable as a presentation device (unless you use a USB to video device). It also just has one micro USB port-which is also the port for charging. As such, you will need to get a USB hub if you want to attach multiple devices (or devices with their own connectors). Like some other users, I did have some problems connecting a Bluetooth mouse (although my Amazon Basics keyboard worked instantly). I tried adding the mouse using the control panel, but this did not work properly. The fix that worked for me was going to the Windows 8.1 Start Screen and going to the settings (tap to the far right of the screen) and using the Bluetooth settings there-that, for some reason, worked perfectly.\n\nI had considered getting a low price laptop rather than the Dell tablet, but I decided on the tablet for three reasons. The first was the price-when I got mine, it was $197 for the 32 GB version. The second was the portability-it is wicked light and has a good battery. The third was I am not a fan of laptop keyboards and prefer to use a separate keyboard and mouse. While this does not work well for using it in my lap, I much prefer using it like a tiny desktop. Since my first real desktop computer was a Mac Classic running MacWrite with 2 MB of RAM, this is an awesome desktop in comparison.\n\nOverall, this is a very good Windows 8.1 tablet. The main improvements would be adding another USB port, a video out port and boosting the storage. The large premium going from the 32 GB to the 64 GB seems unwarranted, giving what flash memory sells for these days."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I bought this tablet for a good friend who had previously told me they believe they have little use for a tablet. However, his laptop was beginning to fail and i knew this would be a great affordable backup and unlike any ordinary tablet, i knew he would like it more than he believed he would.\nI was completely right. The more he uses this tablet the more delighted he is, and now uses it more than any other device including his laptop (which is still running OK for now, he just PREFERS the tablet!). This tablet can do anything his laptop can do - and more, with the additional freedom of light weight and long battery life.\n\nI bought the 32GB version as i got it at a great price. While space is clearly quite limited, this has not yet been a problem as most things can be stored on cloud online storage utilities such as Microsoft's Onedrive or Dropbox. Anything he would rather not store there can be stored on an external hard drive device or flash drive or if he wants files for quick access, there is still room to store on the device or micro SD.\nThis may not be quite so convenient if you need quick access to large files, in which case i might suggest paying a little more for the 64GB version, or simply buying more online storage space if that might be more affordable.\n\nWhile some complain about the size of the device being a drawback, you are aware that you are buying an 8-inch tablet, right? If you think size will be an issue for you, then get a different tablet. My friend has had no issues so far with the screen size, he finds it quite comfortable for browsing, playing, reading etc.. The fact that this tablet is quite small is a benefit in many ways as it makes it more lightweight and practical for using on-the-go or when multitasking.\nI personally own an 11\" Surface Pro, and for a comparison on size, i find that while the size of the Surface is practical and comfortable to use when sitting around, i rarely ever take it out on the move; it is little more appropriate to use standing up than a laptop would be. Additionally the surface is quite heavy - too heavy for me to hold in one hand comfortably unlike the Dell Venue 8 Pro - which is very easy to hold with one hand and operate with the other - as a tablet should be. So try not to consider the size as a limitation but rather as an alternative feature. It may not suit some, but it is not necessarily a limitation to others, and can even be a benefit.\n\nThe only real disappointment experienced was the quality of the Microsoft App store. Of course this tablet has full windows 8.1 functionality, and i would not have bought it if it weren't for that. Still, it would be nice to have some more exciting apps available on the store, it does not compete well with android or iOS stores. However, this is a criticism of Microsoft devices in general, and is not at all a big deal for the Dell Venue pro 8 as it is not windows RT. This is barely even a criticism for an 8.1 device.\n\nOne of the best things about this tablet is the battery life which offers freedom away from wires and chargers, so you can go where you like and still work, chat or play freely for long periods. The battery tends to last about 5 hours with constant use surfing and Skyping and taking pictures, providing the screen brightness is as low as it can be. That is a good long while.\n\nFinally, I bought this tablet 'used' on Amazon; it was in perfect condition but it did not come with a case etc. My friend bought himself a \"MoKo\" Ultra Slim Lightweight Smart-shell Stand Case for Dell Venue 8 PRO. He would recommend this case as it was very affordable, fits perfectly and offers great protection to the tablet. He intends to get a stylus in the future (mainly for drawing doodles/diagrams etc.) but thus far i cannot comment on stylus function. Touch-response is very good however."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "The Dell Venue 8 Pro is awesome, capable of handling the latest that Microsoft has to offer because it is so new, and for the money, you won't find a better deal out there. You can add extra storage on microSD cards up to 128GB, and put the recovery on another inexpensive card to free up even more internal space, so ultimately you get the best of the tablet world (limitless Apps, extremely quick functionality) coupled with the best of Windows (everything you could possibly need in a computer, managing files & programs the way most PC users originally learned how to so you've got familiarity meeting ingenuity, making for a much more enjoyable and innovative experience). I didn't really know what to expect from Windows 8.1, but this is something WAY better than either an iPad or a laptop. I protect my Venue 8 pro with the Targus SafePort Rugged Pro case, which is phenomenal in protection and functionality, and I paired my tablet with a QQ Tech mini wireless Bluetooth keyboard, which also has a track pad for mouse functionality, all in the palm of my hands. I couldn't be happier with my purchase, and Dell customer service has been exceptional. People will be talking about this product well into the future because of how fast & functional it is for the price. With the add-on options like MiraCast and micro-USB-to-USB adapters, as well as the Bluetooth capabilities for devices, you won't even miss the old-fashioned clunky cables or HDMI/USB ports. This is the way computers are going, and I give this product an A++, and I totally recommend it to anyone looking at minimizing their initial tablet & add-on amenity costs."}

I finally gave up on it and threw in the trash. I'm going back to my Nexus 7."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I am a computer professional on the road 3-4 times a month.  My iPhone5 (connected to the company's Exchange server) is my primary communication device.  I can read email and view Office docs, PDFs, etc. on my iPhone.  As a reading device its great.  However, to create and edit Office docs I must switch to my Dell laptop.  I was hoping the Venue 8, with its full version of Office 2013, would allow me to quickly and conveniently edit docs on-the-fly (in meetings, at the airport, on the plane, etc.)\n\nIn the end, I found the screen is just too small, the Office experience too \"twitchy\" and the entire experience more frustrating than helpful.  After 2 weeks, I am returning my Venue 8 to Amazon.  I will probably go with a MS Surface Pro 2 or an iPad Air (now that Office is on the iPad).\n\nGeneral note: Be sure to download and install all of the Microsoft and Dell updates asap.  They will likely address instability (app crashes) and UI issues (double-typing on the soft keyboard) you experience out-of-the-box.  For me, there were plenty: 30+ updates from MS and a dozen or so from Dell.  In particular, spend the time to reflash the BIOS (A05 3/5/14).  Also, since this is an x86 Windows system, you need antivirus and the firewall enabled.\n\nNote on Office 2013: While you do get a full Office 2013 license (which you activate separately), the Office apps -- unlike IE which has both a \"Metro\" and \"Classic\" version -- run only in \"Classic\" mode.  In the end, this is the crux of my issues and why I am returning my Venue 8.  See below.\n\nPros:\n- Build quality, display, touchscreen and overall HW experience.  Kudos to Dell for making a solid product.  I found the HW, battery-life and overall usability to be just fine.\n\n- While Windows 8 is a hodge-podge experience and I am not a fan (is one integrated desktop/tablet experience really what the world wants?), MS did a decent job with 8.1.  The whole \"some apps run native to Metro, while others run in Classic mode\" chaos is a bit disorienting, but, as a whole, the experience is getting better with each rev of Windows 8.\n\n- Able to run most Windows apps.  All of the standard mobile/desktop apps that you use on a daily basis install and work on the Venue 8.  I didn't try any high-horsepower apps, but all of the usual stuff works.  I found the Windows Store useless (too few choices), but that's no surprise.\n\nCons:\n- While, in general, I think the Dell HW is good, I was disappointed in a couple areas: (1) the speaker is mono.  I guess I am spoiled by my Kindle Fire's stereo speakers with spatial enhancement.  Still, mono?  (2) No video-out connector.  I knew this going in.  In theory, Miracast wireless video mirroring is supposed to work, but I never tried it.\n\n- Little niggly operational things here and there tarnish the overall experience, especially for Classic mode apps.  Example: Auto spell-correct when using the on-screen keyboard.  Even when enabled in the general Keyboard Settings, this functionality does not work in many (all?) Classic mode apps -- for example, Evernote.  The built-in MS apps get auto-spell correct during keyboard input, but others do not.  This is QUITE frustrating.  As a long-time iOS user it never dawned on me that on-screen keyboard spell correction could be \"optional\".\n\n- There are other Windows 8 quirks that are widely documented, but are exacerbated on a small screen.  Example: Classic mode apps with scrollbars are bipolar.  This is well known.  To read more content you can either press on the document and slide UP to \"pull\" the page upward or grab the scrollbar slider and slide it DOWN!  On a laptop, with plenty of real estate and a high-res touchpad or pointer, this conflicting behavior might be tolerable.  However, on an 8\" display where large areas of the screen can be taken over by an embedded applet (i.e. a video player) finding the tiny sliver on the edge to pull in the proper direction can become an exercise in frustration.  Sure, a bluetooth mouse or a stylus helps, but is that really how we're supposed to interact with this device?\n\n- The on-screen keyboard is too large and frequently covers the input box.  There are 3 different on-screen keyboard layouts (one being handwriting recognition), but all of them occupy a major (30%?) of the bottom portion of the screen.  Sure, you can drag the keyboard to move it out of the way, but since it can't be resized this does no good.  Slide it down to see the input box but then you can't type \"z\", \"x, \"c\", etc. and the spacebar!  Again, the Metro apps accommodate this better, but if you're planning to use a lot of Classic apps (like Office), you'll be frustrated with constantly needing to reserve enough screen real estate for the (large) on-screen keyboard.  Again, a bluetooth keyboard addresses this issue.\n\nOverall, this experience explains why MS pushes the integrated keyboard covers on their Surface products.  If your goal is to improve productivity working on Office documents, then right now I would say Windows 8.1+Office on an 8-inch tablet (no matter how well made) without a keyboard and/or stylus is not a good choice."}

I love the quick notes and all the programs I need to swiftly breeze through my documents at full product sizes not trial its all included. this Dell is AWESOME I recommend it to EVERYONE!! The screen is nice and broght and clear, I compared to my sons tablet, this is a force to be reckoned with. Excellent product shipping was super quick I never been so happy with a product before!"}

Finger click recognition even on perfectly large enough targets is often either not recognized or recognized wrongly with some annoying UI surprise you didn't aim for.\n\nThis alone resulted in nobody in the family ever picking it up to use it for anything. I specifically bought it to run a language program on it,, but that software gets errors on this machine and won't run. I'm not blaming this on Dell, the hardware seems good enough, the only thing that might trace back to a fault with Dell's hardware is the touchscreen accuracy.  The rest is all WIndows.\n\nI can't recommend this thing, unless you got a very specific purpose in mind that requires full windows on a tablet.\nOr if you want to use it as a tiny computer hooking up bluetooth keyboard and mouse, it should work fine for that.\n\nIf the issues weren't mostly Microsoft's fault, this would get 2 stars from me for annoyance."}

However, if you want to play games, or do any other Java-based applications, this is NOT the tablet for you. This comes with a limited version of Windows 8 that does not support Java applications. I like to play games on Pogo.com, and cannot play any of the many Java-based games. I also found that, on the few games that I could play, trying to grab and slide objects across the screen was EXTREMELY frustrating. Most of the time, the whole screen moved with the object, and when I did finally get just the object to move, it jumped around, and was very difficult to maneuver. So overall, for the basics, it's a fine tablet. But if you're a gamer, don't bother."}

It died dead, too. I'll explain the problem:\n\n1.) The mini USB cord that comes with it is pretty much the same as all the other mini USBs you have around the house. But if you ever use a different cord than the one that comes with it, you run the risk of blowing up the device. That's what they said I did to mine. Okay: use ONLY the cord that comes with the device. Got it.\n\n2.) The mini USB cord that comes with it can evidently be inserted into it the \"wrong\" way. There's some way that I can put it in upside down without knowing it. That also wrecks the device.\n\nEven though I paid my own money for this product (sometimes I'm sent things to review), I threw this device in the trash after the second explosion. I can't deal with devices that are so fussy and fickle. I'm a technologist. Every other device I own doesn't care which cord I use (and if it does, it comes with a proprietary plug so I don't make the mistake). Every other device has a clear \"right way\" and \"wrong way\" to insert the cord.\n\nThis is engineering inanity. I hope some day Michael Dell goes back to the idea that started the company: making quality products for business users.\n\nDon't buy this product. I bought it to support Windows 8.1, which evidently I'm the only person alive who loves that OS. But I'm all done with Dell after this silliness.\n\n(Oh, and I've consulted FOR Dell in the past several times, and have several friends who work there. I'm not biased against them. I'm mad that they made me go through all this silliness at a time when they really need to find ways to earn buyers.)"}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I was a bit hesitant to get an 8\" tablet for Windows 8.1 because of the display size. I have quite a few tablets including the Apple iPad  7\"  and 10\", two current Kindle HD tablets in both sizes, an Asus 10\", a Microsoft Surface Pro, a Dell XPS 1810,  and a Nexus 7. I wanted something a little smaller that would run Windows 8 for the productivity.\n\nI have been using this tablet for only a couple of hours, but so far I think it does a good job of running Windows 8.1 at a descent speed. The graphics are wonderful and the colors are excellent. It keeps going into a dim mode, but I may be able to find a setting to disable that.\n\nI have not yet loaded many of the programs that I use, but but so far the speed in executing functions has been great. The touch keyboard can be set to use a standard keyboard so that you have the function keys and the CNTL, ALT, DELETE keys, but they don't seem to work in conjunction with other key presses. If you are an advanced user and want to make file menus available on some screens, you may need a Bluetooth keyboard to do this.  I bought the Logitech Bluetooth keyboard, and it worked great for some of the setup.[...]. I also found that a Bluetooth mouse was very helpful for the setup.\n\nThe only downsides that I have noticed so far is that the touch is not always very responsive. Resizing of a browser screen doesn't work at all unless you have a Bluetooth mouse to do it. Text on some of the screens is pretty tiny, but this may be modified with a setting.\n\nSo far, I like it more than I thought I would. There are a couple of issues that may be rectified with setting, but that is yet to be seen. I thought I might also mention that there is a slot for a sim card. So you may be able to insert a dim that you have for 4G/3G connectivity. I have a sim card, but haven't tried it yet. If this works it would be a great plus as most tablets cost an additional $100 for an internal sim card. As I mentioned in the beginning of this review, I have used this tablet for only a couple of hours, and I'm sure there is more to learn about it. I will upgrade this review as I learn more whether they be good or disappointments. So far, I am happy with it.\n\nUpdate: 3/30/14\nI have worked with this tablet for a few hours tonight, and it as issues that I can't tolerate. The problems that I am experiencing could very well mean that I have a defective device, but this is something that I would not use on a regular basis. I have decided to return this tablet and continue my search for my \"perfect 8\" Windows 8.1 tablet\". I do still want an 8\" Windows 8.1 tablet for portability and productivity. This just isn't the one for me. I am considering the Leveno ThinkPad 8, but it has not yet been released.\n\nPros for this tablet:\n - At 1200 x 800, the display is very good, and colors are sharp. The automatic settings do dim the screen too much. So the settings have to be changed to turn off automatic brightness.\n - I had no problems with WIFI connectivity, and the speeds were sufficient for a good browsing experience.\n - System processing and response time is plenty speedy. There is practically no lag time in opening programs and switching from one screen to another.\n - Got connected to our home network and Windows HomeGroup without too many problems. There were a couple of glitches getting connected to these and installing connectivity to printers and devices, but this may have been a Windows thing, and not a problem of the device.\n\nCons for this tablet:\n - The touch screen is sometimes non-responsive and sometimes too sensitive.\nIn my opinion, a device such as this is most beneficial for its portability. This means that it should be useful without a keyboard or mouse. For my initial setup, I needed both. I couldn't find a way to get a context menu (right click) without the mouse. This is needed to pin programs to the start menu. For combination keys such as CNTL + Enter, you need a keyboard. Such keystrokes are necessary to view file menus for some programs. I wasn't able to do any of these using the on-screen keyboard even when I enabled the standard keyboard. Once I got everything set up using a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard, I found that the response of the touch keyboard wasn't working well. More often than not, multiple entries were made with one touch. In many cases, the screen needing the keyboard entry was covered by the keyboard. So I couldn't see where the multiple entries were. The on-screen keyboard problems were not limited to any specific application - they were across the board even on the sign-on screen.\n\n - Touch screen does not work properly even with a stylus.\nNormally, windows can be resized with either a stylus or a finger. This doesn't work on this tablet. Trying to resize windows may be done with the corner sizing point with multiple tries. Resizing from the sides, top, or bottom is impossible. I tried to do this with my finger and with a stylus, and it didn't work at all for either.\n\n - The whole purpose of a touch screen is that the touch function works. If it doesn't, the tablet is useless.\n\nConclusion:\nThis tablet will work pretty well if you plan to always use a mouse and keyboard with it. I have other Windows 8.1 tablets, including the Surface 8 Pro and a Dell XPS18, and don't have these problems. For me, it isn't worth the frustration to have a tablet that the touch screen doesn't work. I will be returning this tablet to Amazon.\n\nUPDATE: 4/12/14\nI did return the first tablet to Amazon, but decided to give it another chance because of all the positive reviews. Maybe I did get a defective unit the first time. So I ordered the tablet again from VegasTrading at a slightly more reasonable price. The new tablet did not have the micro simm card port, and did not have Microsoft Office on it as it should have. At any rate, this time, I did the bios update, the firmware update for the touch screen, and a couple of other driver updates from the Dell web site. The problem with multiple entries on the touch screen persisted. So I called Dell tech support,and they had no clue what to do. As always, when they don't know the answer, they suggest resetting the PC. Since I had seen the touch problem on two units, resetting the unit made no sense to me. It also didn't seem likely that I would get two tablet that had the same problem. At this point, I was ready to give up on the Venue 8 and return it. The multiple entries on the touch wasn't worth the aggravation. Still, I thought that there had to be some kind of adjustment to resolve the touch issues.\n\nSo I called VegasTrading to find out about returning the tablet. I got the owner of the company, and was very impressed with his knowledge of computers in general. He scheduled a time to call me back that was convenient for me. Naturally, the didn't know the solution for the problem \"off the top of his head\", but he found a solution on the Dell forums, and fixed the problem by taking control of my tablet. I was also impressed that he was more concerned with me being happy with the tablet than keeping the sale. He was more than willing to have me return it if I wasn't happy with it. He also downloaded Microsoft Office that hadn't been included on my tablet. Now the Venue 8 is working well for me so far, and I am happy with it. At this point, I would recommend this tablet, and VegasTrading as a seller. From this experience, I would not hesitate buying electronics from VegasTrading. They really care about their customers and support them."}

Maybe the tablet had been returned  but it looked faultless to me. I bought the tablet in part to learn  to use Windows 8 - I have a Dell Venue 8 android. For some reason, the Pro seems more solid - buttons feel better - overall a higher quality. I'm not sure the ops system Win 8 is the best for a small tablet as compared with android. But improvements with 8.1 and other updates, lets me get by for now. I am considering the Dell stylus to better use the system. I have an inexpensive stylus that is not powered (the Dell is) but it is only good for the very basic tasks. Don't have a keyboard but may get one in the future - Be aware that this unit does not have a separate GPS - location appears to be done thru wifi connection.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I looked at these a couple months before buying one.  I was really excited to get it.\n\nI wanted a device that I could use as a backup for my computer when I'm traveling and do real work if I needed it. I also wanted a device that could replace my recently dead Kindle - which is going on a bout 5 years old.\n\nIn the end, though after trying for two months, the venue did work pretty well, it didn't work for me.  I took it back and ordered a Kindle Paperwhite.\n\nIf you have a need for PC power instead of android power in a wifi based tablet - this might be right for you.\n\nSo what did I like about the Venue 8?  Several things:\n\n1. I liked the size - it is a convenient size to carry with you.  It's a bit heavy for it's size, but that's because it's packing a lot in.\n2. It's a full-function PC.  You can do powerpoint or word or excel on it, you can do emails, you can load real programs on it - not just apps\n3. It's reasonably fast.  It boots quickly, and it has a powerful processor.\n4. The screen is reasonably good - nice for watching videos and such\n5. It seems very well -built and reasonably rugged.\n6. I was able to get files on and off using a micro usb to usb adapter cable.\n7. Windows 8 wasn't bad on this device - I pretty quickly learned how to navigate it.\n\nOK, what didn't I like\n1. I just couldn't get the hang of the touch screen with windows.  Using windows with my fingers on this small screen just did not work for me.  Unlike IOS, which has finger sized buttons for everything - this device uses windows 8 - which requires a lot of detailed touching.  My fat fingers are apparently not detailed enough because I constantly was touching the wrong link and would have to navigate backwards to correct my error.  This became really frustrating to me.  Yes you could zoom windows up, but then you would have to zoom them back out to see anything on the screen.\n\n2. There's not much connectivity - a single micro usb port on the corner of one of the long edges - so you really can't connect anything to the device while it is sitting on the desktop in landscape mode, because the port is then situated along the top edge of the device.  This thing needs an SD slot\n\n3. Battery life - was about 3-4 hours.  Not enough for me when I'm on the road.  And it ddn't seem to sleep very well.  Every time I picked it up in and airport or on a plane the battery seemed to be dead - which kind of defeats the purpose of carrying it around.\n\n4. It's a bit heavy for it's size and to be really useful you need a bluetooth keyboard with it - more weight.\n\n5. And the straw that broke my back.  I really wanted to get into the habit of taking my notes on the device in one-note.  At first I bought a passive digitizer pen - that didn't work at all.  Then I bought the second generation active pen from Dell.  Well it was better, but still not really ready for prime -time.  There is no way I could take notes on the device.  In fact the operation of the pen was somewhat of a mystery to me - it had zero instructions with it and it seemed to work sometimes and sometimes not work.  I spent a few weeks trying to figure it out and never got it to be reliable enough for business use.\n\nSo that's it, pretty decent device.  compact, small and works OK.  It just isn't the device I'm  going to fill my precious briefcase space with."}

I am totally impressed with how well this Dell Venue 8 pro has been able to fill its shoes.  I am neither app crazy nor game crazy, so this thing fits the bill perfectly.  Let's face it...I can read (and edit, if I like) a Word document in Word - not some half-baked emulator.  Bump it down 1/2 star for not being able to charge from a PC USB port, but that's a minor inconvenience.  Now Windows phone looks like it could become a serious threat to the iPhone in my pocket."}

And that's where the disconnect happened for me.\nI just couldn't find the right keyboard, mouse combo that felt right. There just wasn't enough touch only software for my interests to justify this tablet. I get a lot more out of my android device. Please understand that this is an excellent tablet, but for me I was hoping to replace my laptop and or desktop use, and the 8 inch form factor coupled with the lack of i/o ports just didn't do it for me. I would go with the Asus transformer if I decide to do it again...."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "Let me begin with an apology if I sound too excited in my review. I do not work for Dell. I'm a freelance photographer and computer geek and I can finally stop buying tablets thinking the next one will be \"THE ONE\" because I finally found it. Having a Surface for the hard work and a few (four) other tablets I've kept searching for the right balance between power and portability for the normal office work and just sitting on the sofa reading news or scouring the web entertainment secondary tablet. This tablet was the right choice. Having read many reviews and gone to the Microsoft store to feel several of the new 8\" tablets I chose the Venue 8 pro. It's likely for most people this would probably be enough processing power nearly all the time. Excluding gamers, video editing, photoshop work and all those high processor intensive software.\n\nBuild: The build is solid without creak or flex and a great texture and rubberized finish on the back. The others I held didn't have the texture on the back like the Dell which made them feel too slick making me feel I may accidentally drop it. When I held the Dell I could tell this worry no longer applied. I really didn't think there'd be as much of a difference with this texture as people mentioned, but it's a really huge difference. No worries it may slip from my fingers? CHECK!!! It's very light and slim which makes it much easier to keep with me daily than my Surface.\n\nPortability: For on the go regular use which would apply to most people this tiny computer is perfect. It's light, slim and easy to hold with a single hand over a long period.\n\nFunctionality: It runs Office without any issues. Fast and snappy it goes between programs without hesitation. I can turn the Venue8 Pro on in a split second and search the internet so fast.  I have a couple of Galaxy Tabs and Acer android tabs and no matter how much everyone loves Android it is sluggish and even a brand new tab didn't make it search the internet quickly. So far I cannot complain about a thing since this is not my computer for Photoshop or gaming (nor will it be) but for regular daily use and entertainment I feel it strikes the perfect balance between fun and work which in my experience as a real technogeek electronics lover would really guess would fit a very large majority of people's needs. I have a desktop and Surface for my heavy hitting Adobe photoshop, gaming, and video work so I haven't bothered trying them on the Venue8 Pro and am not likely to. The Surface and desktop are and will be what I use for those processor intensive Adobe software, and playing Call of Duty. This is an Atom processor not an i7 chip. These little processors have definitely come a long way.. so happy with it. If someone's not happy with the processing power of this little beast they're likely expecting to do way too much with a tablet.\n\nSound: The sound coming out of the tiny speaker on the bottom is very loud. One of the loudest speakers I've heard on any small electronic device. I don't plan on playing music full blast on it, but it will certainly be heard even in a room that isn't silent.\n\nScreen: The screen resolution may not be amazing, but I was happily surprised by now clear and crisp this screen is. I can't even complain about the resolution since it was so easy to read and sharp. Would I like a higher res screen...? Sure I would, but I think that had I not known this screen's resolution I would've thought it was higher.\n\nInputs etc.: MicroSD, Micro USB for power and external extras. Normal 3.5mm for speakers or headset. Will need a micro to usb dongle to add anything with a full usb plug. No Micro HDMI\n\nPros: Fast, full windows, light and slim, clear screen, great speaker sound, long battery life, solid build, wonderful tacky surface making it easy to hold.\n\nCons: No gps, No NFC chip and missing windows button on the front of the tablet. It just takes a little getting used to pressing the button on the side to go home so it's not a huge deal. Just wanted to update that it does not have a micro HDMI input but I rarely mirror my computer screen so it never entered my mind until I realized when watching shows I've missed I would have to use my Surface or Xbox for that.\n\nPen: (update upon receiving the pen) The original problems reported about the pen seem to have been fixed. I was slightly worried when I researched the Venue8 Pro due to pen issues, but we ordered a pen from Dell last Wed. and got it Monday. I was worried that it would be delayed due to the backup with the initial issues. Dell sent it out quickly along with our cover. The pen has the same feel and size of a real writing pen. It takes one AAA battery that it came with. The pen writes smoothly and is clearly pressure sensitive. Unlike other tablets with capacitive pens this one is an active digitizer pen and very accurate for those who want to write and draw. I've only used it a little bit in OneNote and Fresh paint. It's perfect for taking notes in OneNote. It's also got a nice distance as you get closer you see the target ring on screen where you're pointing. A nice solid built pen and it works like a dream. Now this tiny computer is perfect.\n\nSummation:  Most people needing a tablet for regular daily office use and most entertainment during personal hours will likely find this little dynamo a dream come true that won't break the bank. This was a present for my partner's birthday and it was the best possible choice for a tablet. I'll be buying myself one soon because I've enjoyed playing with it while I set it up for his work and personal use so much. I didn't mind picking up the Surface, but this is extremely light and easy to hold for a long period on the sofa or in your office. This should definitely be a runaway hit as far as I'm concerned. It leaves very little to be desired as it has nearly everything on it. With or without the pen this computer is fantastic. At least you do have the option of getting a pen later on if you wish with the Venue8 Pro. My desire for a tablet with pen option is due to the size of the screen. At some point on the desktop you'll most likely wish you had one because even the smallest fingers would have difficulty pressing some buttons or ticking some boxes on desktop programs or websites. There aren't many small Windows tablets with a digitizer pen and this is only one of two new ones. Using the metro apps with fingers is nice and easy. I look forward to giving my new Android tablets away as gifts because this is so much smoother, better and a complete computer. This tablet is one GIANT 5 star item and it's at an affordable price. My apologies for the ebullience of my review.. I just couldn't believe this delivered so much. With four tablets already I was tired of buying new ones and hoping for more all those times. MORE just got here for me and it's the Dell Venue8 Pro."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I'm a software developer so I have a lot of tablets and computers. I came across a deal on a Dell Venue 8 Pro and decided to bite. I'm glad I did.\n\nPros:\n* Includes full Windows 8.1 (not RT) and Office 2013 Home & Student\n* The quad-core Intel Atom processor is reasonably fast enough for about everything I can imagine for typical use, though it can seem to 'struggle' a bit on complex & bloated web pages. However, it's still much faster than my older Asus Netbook computer with a previous generation single-core Atom processor but you still wouldn't want to run Photoshop, Visual Studio, or other CPU and memory intensive applications on it, but that's not what this tablet is for.\n* Very good build quality. It feels very solid.\n* Very good screen quality. The resolution is good for the size of the screen.\n* Great browser performance for a tablet\n* Great battery life\n\nCons:\n* The biggest con is that you can't easily charge the unit while also using the single USB connector for data transfer.\n* USB is not USB 3.0, only USB 2.0.\n* Windows button on the top edge can be annoying. It works but it's not optimal in my opinion.\n* Typical Windows will require installing lots of updates. I also updated the BIOS from Dell, and an ambient light sensor setting update... so keeping this tablet up to date is a lot more like keeping a real computer up to date than an iPad (because this tablet is more like a real computer).\n* Need to use the included Dell USB cable to charge the device but you don't need the actual charger, just the cable.\n\nOther:\n* Would be even better with 4GB of RAM (even just browsing with a bunch of tabs open can use a lot of memory these days)\n* 32GB leaves about 9 or 10GB free after getting Office working. I think that should be fine for most people who don't need to keep a bunch of music or video files on their computer, and who don't install a lot of bloated software.\n* You can also make a USB recovery drive (with an 8GB or more drive) using the included Windows 'Recovery Drive' tool and free the space taken by the recovery partition (about 4GB; make sure that you tap or select the option to delete the recovery partition after the USB recovery drive has been created and before you exit the tool). The whole process is very easy with the tool.\n* You can use the MicroSD, SDHC and SDXC reader for additional storage capacity, but you probably won't want to install any applications there even though you can (it's slower and not optimal).\n* I thought the auto-brightness adjustments was too dim and I couldn't change the screen brightness until I went into the advanced power settings and disabled adaptive brightness (under Display).\n* Difficult to use touch on normal desktop applications because the screen is small and desktop applications are designed for a mouse pointer (not 'fat fingers'), but you can always add a USB or Bluetooth mouse.\n\nYou'll probably also want to buy something like this (I did and it works great):&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Cable-Matters-2-Pack-On-The-Go-OTG-Micro-USB-2-0-to-USB-M-F-Flexible-Adapter-Cable-6-Inches/dp/B00GM0OZ4O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Cable Matters (2-Pack) On-The-Go (OTG) Micro-USB 2.0 to USB (M-F) Flexible Adapter Cable - 6 Inches</a>\nAnd might be interested in a decent Bluetooth mouse that works nicely with this tablet:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/HP-X4000b-Bluetooth-Mouse-H3T51AA-ABC/dp/B009KY58FE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">HP X4000b Bluetooth Mouse (H3T51AA#ABC)</a>\nIf you're interested in docking stations:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Plugable-UD-3000-USB-3-0-Universal-Docking-Station-for-Windows-8-1-8-7-XP-DVI-VGA-or-HDMI-to-2048x1152-Gigabit-Ethernet-Audio-2-USB-3-0-Ports-4-USB-2-0-Ports-4A-AC-Power-Adapter/dp/B008N06I2I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Plugable UD-3000 USB 3.0 Universal Docking Station for Windows 8.1, 8, 7, XP (DVI, VGA, or HDMI to 2048x1152, Gigabit Ethernet, Audio, 2 USB 3.0 Ports, 4 USB 2.0 Ports, 4A AC Power Adapter)</a>\n\nI really wanted to find a way to give this tablet 5 stars but I'm going to have to only give it 4 because I'm very disappointed that you can't charge the Venue while also using the USB 2.0 connector for data or a docking station (plus the other cons).

I have ordered 3 of these and all three work great.\nIt is easy to configure to boot to the desktop or in my case to boot to the application program I want and to automatically sign on to the bluetooth connection.

Also the auto screen dimming works a little too good.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "After debating long and hard about whether or not to purchase a tablet I opted to go with something easily portable, lightweight, and relatively inexpensive. Since I wanted the product to be work friendly, I opted for a Windows 8.1 tablet. Dell seemed like a great option and overall the the Venue 8 Pro is a zippy little device. The screen doesn't stand up to the Surface, but it is as good as most.\n\nThe reason for the two star rating is when I opened the box and powered on the device, there was a noticeable 0.5cm bright area in the lower right quadrant of the screen, as though it was burned. When I contacted dell, they explained that I would need to ship the tablet to \"Dell Depot\" and allow them to troubleshoot the hardware and see if they could fix it. When I explained that I'd literally JUST opened the box, they said they showed the tablet was purchased on December 7th. I purchased it on March 15th. Either way, there is supposed to be a 1 year warranty. I explained that I'd be happy to send them proof of the purchase date, but of course, the guy said he had to go by his records. To be clear, sending it to \"Dell Depot\" would have been a process several weeks long. I told him that I just purchased it, that it was defective, and that they were lucky I was seeking an exchange as opposed to a refund. He asked me if he could place me on hold while he checked his \"resources\". When he returned he told me that the best thing for me to do was call Amazon because Dell couldn't help me.\n\nMy advice: Purchase from a company that stands behind their products."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "Dell supplied the wrong charging cable. The port is rectangular and the plug is trapezoidal so it can be plugged in either way, and if you plug it in wrong, you can bend or break the pin block.  This is a serious design flaw and Dell needs to recall them all and replace the connector.  I send my back to dell for not charging because of this issue.  They didn't replace the connector, all they did just use a tool to bend the pin blocks back in place and send it back to me,  Right now, when I put the supplied charging cable in, it still very wiggling and loose.  Sometimes, it takes a couple tries to get it charge.  It's a matter a time that I have to erase all the settings again and sent it back to Dell to fix for not charging. Dell screwed up the design and customers are paying for the mistake and troubles. This is 100% Dell's fault. They need to make right.  I asked them for replacement and they said they won't exchange a new one even I only had this tablet about 100 days.  They won't even replace the damaged connector.  Stay away, their warranty are terrible.  I used to have a lot of dell products and next time, I will look for some other brands instead.  Dell's service is going down hill."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I bought this while I was on vacation about a week ago.  I wanted a tablet, but did not want an Android based system because it wouldn't play nice with my home network with 10 computers on it.  I also did not want a system based on Windows RT because of the reduced functionality contained in that half an operating system.  On the other side of the coin, I believed most full Windows 8 tablets cost about $1000 -- thank you Microsoft for your overpriced Surface tablets.  Then I found this unit on sale for 2 bills at MicroCenter.\n\nBattery Life:  I have an 11\" Asus Ultrabook with an I3 processor, but the battery life, even with screen on the lowest screen brightness setting, is only about 3 hours when playing videos.  With the Dell, battery life is much greater.  My wife and I took it on an airplane from Washington, DC, to Los Angeles.  My wife watched over three hours of video and the Dell wwas still at about 70% battery life.  I've spent gthree to four hours playing Plants vs Zombies and the battery is still holding at 70%.  I haven't left it on to see how long it takes to drain, but with my use it appears that 10 hours would be a good estimate.\n\nWindows Functionality:  This is a real PC with a full 32 bit version of Window 8 in a tablet form.  I came with a product key for Microsoft Office 2013 student and home edition, which alone would set you back about the price of this PC.  I use WordPerfect (the better word processor!) and occasionally need Word.  These just aren't available on an Android tablet.  It interfaces with my home network, which includes three PCs working with television and audio systems, a main desktop computer which doubles as a work computer and server for music and video, as well as five laptops for me, my wife, and two of my wife's children.\n\nScreen:  Includes Intel HD Graphics with a native 1280 X 800 resolution.  Windows 8 prefers 1920 X 1080, so some objects run below the bottom of the screen and you cannot get to control buttons unless you turn the screen sideways.  Colors are very good.  Dell has an update to the automatic screen brightness control system which should be installed, or the screen stays pretty dark.\n\nMemory:  32GB is barely enough.  I highly recommend getting the 64GB system.  The micro-sd drive operates as a secondary hard drive which is best for storing videos, music pictures and documents.\n\nStart - up:  With the sweep second hand on my watch, I measured time to get to the from pushing the button to the first splash screen -- 15 seconds.  To full O/S after logging on to your account took another 15 seconds.  Shut-down took 12 seconds.  This is significantly faster than my ASUS Ultrabook, where you will fall asleep before you reach the opening splash screen and where you can wash the dishes faster than doing a reboot.\n\nOn-screen keyboard:  The keyboard with the O/S is really limited.  It has no escape key and no alt button and no \"Windows\" button.  Dell kindly has their own keyboard, but it is not readily accessible.  I highly recommend purchasing an aftermarket Bluetooth keyboard/stand/cover.\n\nGripes:  My main gripe is that there is not enough i/o.  Specifically, 1) there is no HDMI output.  Apparently, Dell is supporting Miracast.  2) The only I/O port is a micro-usb port which is also used for charging.  3) you still need to install StartMenu8.  4) System will not charge from a standard micro-usb attached to another computer, but needs Dell's higher output plug in.  Finally, the screen is a bit small for use I desktop mode -- fine control that usually requires a mouse is difficult despite the fact that my fingers are fairly fine."}

And because of the 3 months, I am outside my window to return it with Amazon. Lovely."}

Read this before you commit to buy.\n\nSee here: [...]\n\nand here: [...]\n\nAlthough they managed to fix the Venue 11, they never got to fix it for Venue 8 Pro yet. The latest BIOS A05 and touch screen firmware never worked for me. The root cause seems to stem out from the recent updates, from MS. Dell tried to fix it. So until they iron out all the issues, why would anyone bother to buy something they know now have an known issue?"}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "*Update 11/6/2014, tablet is still working great. Battery life is excellent and I never have to think about charging it. Performance is also excellent - I am still surprised at how fast this thing runs. I did perform a Wimboot installation of the OS, which brings the free space up to about 14-15GB before use (I'm at about 11GB free now). Hopefully Dell and Microsoft will be doing those types of installs on these tablets in the future, and also hoping that MS will continue improving Windows to make it a contender with iOS and Android. I think they're moving in the right direction and that the next generation of these tablets will be even better without some of the technical gremlins like drivers and lack of free space.\n\nI've had my DV8P since November and really enjoy using it.\n\nProblems - I had to do a factory restore a few weeks in because of a few weird gremlins, but since then, it's been smooth sailing. I've installed all of the updates, such as BIOS, drivers, and touch panel firmware, which allegedly addressed the complaints other people were having. I don't use a pen so I can't comment on that.\nThe 32GB internal drive does come with only 5-6GB free, which is annoying. There are tricks to free up space, some of which I've done.\nIn reality, even though I don't like having such little free space, it hasn't been a problem. I have a 16GB microSD card to store large files, mainly music and video files.\n\nNow, for the good stuff - the battery life on this tablet is great for me. I haven't specifically timed it, but I was writing an essay once for five hours, and with the screen on the entire time on low brightness, listening to music and using a Bluetooth keyboard, the battery still had 50% life.\nI unplug it in the morning, bring it with me to school, and at the end of the day, I never come close to depleting the battery. I take notes on it using a Bluetooth keyboard and OneNote without issues.\n\nPerformance is excellent, and much better than the Atom processor and 2GB RAM would look on paper. I never feel like the system is slowing down, and memory usage is never an issue - I check in the task manager and I'm usually using 1.2-1.5GB.\n\nWindows 8.1 is a joy to use on a touch screen device like this one. I have 8.1 on my desktop and the Metro interface got to be a bit tedious, but on the Dell (or any touch-enabled tablet/laptop) it makes much more sense. On the flip side, using the Windows desktop can be a pain, even with the touch-friendly tweaks that have been made. Office is the same way - it was meant to be used with a keyboard and mouse. Again, I use a BT keyboard and mouse and then I can do real work in Word or Excel, which I find a huge advantage over iOS and Android as a student.\nHaving full Windows means I can run all of the little utilities and random programs that I do on my desktop, which I really like. The Surface tablets are nice, but I wouldn't buy an ARM-powered Surface 2 given that tablets like this Dell have just as good battery life while being much more capable (granted, the ARM devices are immune from all of the x86 malware out there).\n\nBoth cameras are serviceable, but nothing special; I have no need for them and never use them.\n\nHaving had none of the issues that other reviewers have faced (fortunately), I would recommend this tablet to anybody. Despite some of the Windows oddities and less-than-smooth behavior, both of which are very rare, I think anyone would be happy with this tablet. Full Windows if you need it, full Office which is a huge bonus, not to mention Metro apps - they're not up to iOS or Android levels, but more mainstream services are coming to 8.1 all the time."}

I am new to Windows 8, but I am finding it pretty easy to explore and learn.  I bought the table with the 64GB capacity and inserted a 64GB micro card which doubles the storage.  I recommend a stylus for the on-screen keyboard; it works well when you are cramped for space, but smaller than I am comfortable with.  I recommend a blue tooth keyboard and mouse for those times you have the space to use them.  These additions make the tablet function a lot more like the laptop I am used to and much easier for MicroSoft Office programs that come on the tablet.  Over all I really like this little unit.  Does exactly what I bought it to do.  I also recommend an adapter (sold on Amazon, that I have ordered and waiting on) that plugs into the micro USB/charger port and gives you the female end to plug a regular USB device into the tablet.  I am not sure if this port puts out any power for say a portable hard drive, but would be really handy if it does.  Over all I give this little guy a big thumbs up over the other tablets I compared it with and the price makes it even more attractive.  The screen image is sharp and bright and the processer works impressively fast."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I bought this at a local office supply store on a whim but immediately regret not getting it on Amazon because I got the 32g version. It is a very nice portable computer, but has all the foibles of Windows like poor power management -it goes to screen saver if you mess up an obscure setting, it stays awake until drained if you don't fiddle with other settings, and will power down if you don't answer the update now or else question. It also had a few sleep of deaths which is the 21st century's blue screen. Don't get the 32g version if you plan on using Office and any number of desktop apps. ITunes, even off loading all the data to a micro SD card, rapidly degrades on board drive space. Office is unusable without a keyboard and mouse. I am sure they won't release the iPad version of Office unless the touch version of Office on Windows is up and working, and they need one badly for Win 8.1. As a reader and media viewer (Hulu, Netflix, Kindle) it works fine. Web browsing is handicapped by the sub-super res screens on Nexus 7 (I own) and iPad Air (I own), as there is no readability option on explorer. I could load Safari on desktop, but I void most things on desktop because it is most touch unfriendly. Battery goes all day if you remember to turn it off when you aren't using it. Just like Windows laptops, sleep is a funky thing with this tablet."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I had high hopes for this tablet.  It got good reviews, it appears well built, and appeared to be a decent deal for the money.  However, I failed to pay much attention to the problems others were pointing out, hoping that solutions that were coming out for the tablet in the form of updates would rectify some of these issues.\n\nFirst problem I had was the fact that I had to pay extra for a digitized stylus that doesn't even work well.  Yes, I read about the problems with the first revision of the stylus (A00) but I waited for the latest revision (A01), upgraded my BIOS and firmware and other drivers, and waited patiently for the pen to arrive.  Well, the stylus works, but just barely.  Even with all the new drivers and the new version, handwriting with this thing is a pain.  The secondary button is not positioned well on the pen, so I found myself clicking on that button as I was writing or drawing.  This acted as a right mouse button, so it was very annoying.  Next was the fact that it did not do a good job of palm resting recognition.  Various times I would use the pen and I still made lines and other marks even while I was writing.  This was unacceptable.  And finally, despite the claim that the A01 revision would have better power management, I was on my third battery in 5 days.\n\nBut that was not even the worst of it.  I bought the Dell Venue Pro 8 Bluetooth keyboard and the Dell Bluetooth travel mouse.  The keyboard was a decent deal because it came with a case that was nice, the stylus can be stored on the back of the case, and the keyboard itself attached to the case cover via magnets.  It was the same size as the tablet so it looked nice closed up.  But unfortunately I noticed a problem with using bluetooth devices and Wifi immediately.  When one or both of these devices were on, Wifi slowed to a crawl.  In fact, Wifi was basically unusable with the keyboard and/or the mouse.  I even tried a Microsoft Bluetooth mouse with the same result.  I contacted Dell Tech Support about this and they were completely useless - I was talking to some moron on the other side of the world whose ultimate solution was to reset my entire device to factory settings.  This infuriated me to the point where I just said it's time to return this thing.  But I did try the reset - and of course it made no difference.\n\nYesterday I went to the Microsoft store and bought the new Asus Vivotab Note 8.  It comes with a Wacom pen that stores in the tablet itself.  I can tell you the Wacom pen works like a charm on this device, and I am very happy with it.  I highly recommend it.  Furthermore (and this will give you a chuckle), I tried my Dell keyboard and mouse with the Asus tablet and they worked great - with no degradation in Wifi whatsoever.  So I'm going to keep those for now.\n\nUntil Dell truly fixes the problems with the Venue Pro 8, I would say avoid it completely."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I bought this Dell Venue 8 Pro because I wanted a reasonably cheap Windows 8.1 tablet with the new quad-core Bay Trail processor. When I received it, it was everything I expected it to be. It ran all of my programs that I threw at it, as well as being able to load the full desktop versions of my favorite websites. It also was very fast and could handle multiple applications at once without breaking a sweat. However, within a month the USB port went out and the tablet would not charge, forcing me to return it for a refund. A little disappointed, I bought another one, thinking that this issue was maybe a fluke and I would get a great one. However, this next tablet would not power on after charging for half the day, no matter how long I held the button down for. After the second one died I gave up on the Venue and bought another tablet. I gave it two stars because it was great when it worked and did everything I expected of it. I will not say that you shouldn't buy it, as it is probably the best Windows 8.1 tablet for the money, but you should make sure to fully test it and make sure that everything works before the 30 day Amazon return policy expires. Hopefully you get a great one because it is quite feature-laden for the price and I loved it for the time it worked.\n\nJeremy"}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I purchased this tablet for home and school use (I teach at a community college and also take graduate courses). I chose this particular model because of the reasonable price as well as the Windows 8.1 OS and the fact that it comes loaded with the full version of Office 2013 for Home and Student (something almost never found preloaded on laptop or desktop PCs). When it arrived I installed a ScanDisk 64 GB micro SD card to maximize the capacity of the Venue. As someone who is proficient using Windows 8.1 but a total newbie with tablet devices, there was quite a learning curve before I felt comfortable managing files and simply navigating around the device. With time I managed to figure out most of what I need to know.\n\nPROS:\nBeautiful display and high quality audio\nNo issues connecting to Wifi\nOffice 2013 installed (not a trial version)\nA \"Home\" button which helps if you find yourself unable to navigate out of a file or app\nMini USB port and available mini to standard USB adapter\nWindows 8.1 is just as confusing on this device as it is on any other device\nGreat battery life - 10 hrs. average.\nVery slim, even in the Dell book style case.\nBlue tooth speakers, keyboards, etc. connect with no problem.\nWorks with blue tooth enabled HDTV\n\nCONS:\n* The quirkiness I referred to is the touch screen. I highly recommend a stylus. I bought a cheap one which solved the problem\n* Lack of available accessories such as custom case (although the Dell case that you can order with it is decent. You will have a difficult time finding custom screen protectors or high quality cases (lifeproof, otterbox, etc.) for this device.\n* It is a \"Dell\" product so if you have issues you may have to deal with \"Dell Customer Support\". I have not had to do that with this product but my experiences with them with other Dell products has been very frustrating.\n* Sometimes the on screen keyboard pops up and covers the block you are supposed to be typing in. I am sure that there is a way to prevent this, but I have not discovered it yet. This has NOT been a major problem, just an occasional inconvenience.\n\nSATISFACTION:\nAfter my first hour or two with the unit I seriously considered returning it and purchasing the much more expensive iPad. After a few days of learning my way around the device I am now satisfied with my purchase and would recommend it to anyone looking for a smaller, low cost tablet device. It really is a great value when you consider that Office 2013 is preloaded and that software alone generally costs almost half of the price of this unit. I STRONGLY recommend that if you buy the Venue, spend the extra $20 - $30 for the 64GB instead of the 32GB unit. I also recommend a 64GB micro SD for file storage. The Scandisk works well. Plus, you can always purchase extra SD cards for movies, etc. There is a way to configure the SD card so the device can play apps stored on it but I am using it strictly for storage. Overall a very good tablet device for the price."}

I would have given it 5 stars because i really like this Tab but, i recently had to get the Charging Port repaired because the prong got damaged and it could not charge. Unfortunately this is a common occurrence (found quite a few others with the same problem on other forums)because of the ports Design. The Charging port can be plugged in upside down which damages the port and eventually destroys it. This falls under user error so is also not covered by Dells standard warranty. Lucky for me i had added SquareTrade insurance from amazon when i bought this and they fixed it no prob. Dell has said they are aware of the problem and had designed the port thus so that different types of chargers could be used not just a single type. which is actually a good idea, if we were made aware of that.\n\nA good idea brought up by others on the forums i was reading was to mark one side of the charging cord so that its easier to know which way it should go in SAFELY.\n\nOther than the charging port i enjoy using my Dell Venue pro very much and intend to continue using it, just a bit more carefully now when i plug in the charging cable."}

Definitely a great bargain I thought. I'd even convinced four other people to buy them. After the first month, the problems began:\n\n1/2014 - The screen edge began to flicker intermittently whenever the system heated up. This happened in the BIOS setup as well as the full Windows UI.\n\n2/2014 - Problem gets much worse and is happening all of the time now. Obviously a hardware issue, I called Dell Support and was asked to give remote access to the tablet. I did so and they verified that I had updated all of my drivers, firmware, etc. They then sent a package for me to return the tablet for service. The package didn't include the required packing materials as stated, so I dug around and found some old antistat bags. I sent it in.\n\n2/2014 - A week later, it is returned to me. I happily fired the tablet up. Within one minute of starting the interactive setup (the device had been reset to factory), the screen edge flickering began again with event greater intensity. I called Dell, they apologized profusely and asked me to wait while they sent another box. After a delay it arrived.\n\n2/2014 - I sent it in a second time.\n\n3/2014 - A week later it was returned to me. As I pulled it out of the box, I found the back of the tablet loose. It snapped back into place as I held it. I turned it on and began setup again. This time, the screen was warped and showed rainbow colors in the top-and-bottom-middles. I called again and was told that I was be \"allowed\" a one-time exchange for a REFURBISHED unit. I asked why, since Dell has had my unit longer than I had, I would not be given a new one and was brushed off. They promised THIS one would be great and I'd have it in 3-5 days.\n\n3/2014 - Five days later with no update on my order, I called back and was told that it had already been shipped via FedEx and I'd have to wait a few more days. When I asked for the tracking number, I was told that there wasn't one. When transferred to the floor manager at the end of my call, I asked again for the tracking number. I was put on hold for 10-15 minutes. When the \"floor manager\" returned, I was told that it was, in fact, not shipped at all, and they had no idea when it would be.\n\nI asked if there was anybody else I could speak to to escalate this issue and was told no, that's all they have are floor managers, but that they would call me when/if there is any update.\n\nIn summary, I'm left with my third useless tablet in as many months. Dell does not wish to support them. Avoid at all costs. Spent the extra $100 for a tablet that is supported and save yourself the headaches."}

Pretty significant drop for a couple of days. It was painless and quick and they refunded me the difference. Awesome. (I believe you have 7 days from purchase to receive any refund on price drops)\n\nFor the new lower price, how could you not buy it!\n\nThe processor is quick and snappy. Runs full version of windows 8.1 and had no hang ups. Make sure you purchase a USB OTG host adapter to maximize utility of your tablet. I am currently writing this review on the tablet with a wireless Logitech keyboard (using the wireless adapter). I was also able to connect a flash drive and USB hub. I tried to connect my 1 TB Toshiba Canvio Slim II however it seems that the USB port doesn't provide enough power to operate the external hard drive. The hard drive lights up but beeps angrily telling me it doesn't have enough juice. I bought a powered USB hub (USB hub has it's own wall outlet) and tried again, success. Something to keep in mind.\n\nNo issues connecting Bluetooth devices, so far connected a Bluetooth keyboard, mouse and speaker.\n\nThe \"start\" menu has some getting use too but I like the screen gestures. Almost like the Blackberry tablet for the few of you that ever used it.\n\nI also installed full version of Civilization 4 which runs flawlessly. (I copied the installation disk to a USB flash drive and was able to install)\n\nI enjoy the smaller form factor of an 8inch tablet since it is more portable and lighter, however still useable.\n\nTechnically the amount of pixels may be less than other tablet devices however I do not see any drop in quality. On a 8 inch screen it is less noticeable than a larger screened device.\n\nBottom Line:\nFor the price (even at retail price $300) this tablet provides great value and usability. This tablet can be used for entertainment and for productivity (Microsoft Office). Highly recommend to anyone. Surprised that Dell was able to make such a great product."}

It definitely comes the closest to seeming like a regular netbook in tablet form.  While many tablets simply won't work or have problems with sites using flash, I have tried several sites that wouldn't work on my ipad or kindle and it not only had no problems, it actually seemed to load them faster than some of my laptops.  (You could watch movies on VUDU, for instance)  Some will say there are less apps for Windows, but to me Windows seems to have the majority of the apps I would be interested in, and in several instances I like their versions better.  They also tend to ask for way less permissions than comparable Google apps.  If you simply want a multimedia device, especially if you are a Prime member, the Kindle Fires are nice.  But if you want much more flexibility and more of a standard computer in tablet form, this is the way to go.  Want a quick link to your favorite news site, but the news apps seem pretty intrusive in terms of their permissions?  Just go to the website in Explorer and pin the site to your desktop--no need for an app.  Windows 8 may seem daunting at first, but it's actually pretty quick to learn your way around.  The one negative you might encounter is the screen often seeming dark compared to some others--just turn off the ambient light sensor and boom, instant bright screen that compares well to any of the others.  I also like that it has the built in SD card slot should I decide I need more storage (not an issue to date).  I like it more the longer I use it."}

Well, looks like some sly scam artist switched out the outer sleeve on the unit.\n\nThe unit I bought was the 64gig version ($250 from Warehousedeals). I received the unit, booted it up, and the SSD is only 32 gigs. Well played, jerk who illegaly switched out the outer sleeve (which has 64gig on it, part R0TGM A00). The box itself containing the unit is the 32 gig version, part JMF10 A00. The person who returned this to Amazon knew what they were doing as I had to hard reset the unit to get it to boot (by using a paperclip). It seems they forced it to shut down so that it couldn't be booted back up. This meant Amazon couldn't validate the actual storage size because it wouldn't boot, but the serial numbers matched the unit and inner box (there is no serial on the 64gig sleeve cardboard). Some scammer returned the 32gig and kept the 64gig. Bravo, idiot.\n\nI recommend Amazon cross reference who returned this one and pursue them with legal action. It's clearly a scam and I'm at the receiving end of it. Not happy.\n\nBuyer beware if you are trying to save $69 on Warehousedeals. I really wish Amazon would better check units for accuracy before re-selling them.\n\nEdit: I hard reset it and it's freezing at the Dell boot screen. Lovely.\n\nEdit 2: I was incorrect about the part number difference. I just bought one from Costco (64 gig, official Dell Tablet Folio case for free) and the part numbers on the box and sleeve are different as well (same as above). Doesn't change the fact that there was a 32gig V8P in the box. I highly recommend buying this from Costco for $299 since it includes the Dell Folio case and 90-day return policy."}

In a tablet form factor that competes with the iPad Mini. Even my high expectations of practical use have been exceeded. Not only is a tiny little computer, it is a good one. Because it has a quality touch screen, it takes advantage of the windoes 8.x interface very well, and I use the touch friendly apps a good bit. The start button is in an awkward place- but that doesn't matter it turns out, as navigating in and out of the start menue is better done with edge swipes anyway. Cases for the Venue are even better than ipad covers. They offer all over protection and a nice \"easel\" cover AND full access to the screen edges, which is essential.\n\nThe cons are short.

We needed this to run a special application and immediately ordered the product for testing.\n\nGood news:\nIt does run windows 8.1 Professional and we needed this for our application.\nIt uses very low power and does not heat up when running our solution.\nIt has a standard USB micro interface that we could connect up to the peripherals we needed  via a USB hub.\n\nLess then good news:\nIt only has one USB port.\nIt does not allow both charging and data connection with the OTG  --on the go :  This means that you are fine as long as you run off battery but eventually you need to plug in to the factory power supply and thus this needed a solution.\n\nEven better news:\nThe +port on Kickstarter allows this tablet to run as a desktop PC solving the Power issue.\n\nSo we have our problem solved  and will continue to use the Dell Venue and +port as an embedded computer and desktop computer replacement that has the added feature of mobility if and when you want and need to be out moving about.\n\nIn short  your factory power supply cable plugs into the +port,  the +port then has a cable that extends to the tablet while at the same time offering a USB 2.0 port to plug in your peripheralsSuch as a keyboard, mouse, data storage device, USB to HDMI adapter for a large screen monitor, etc.  This seems like a trivial issue but it is not.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I may have a problem. This is my third tablet. I may need an intervention. iPads, Nexus tablets, and now Windows? This is so my cry for help.\nOkay, got that out of the way.\n\nSimply put, this is the Windows equivalent of the Nexus 7. Windows is undergoing a familiar shake out of questionable tablets similar to how Android went about it. Many were under powered, overpriced, poor performing and otherwise as Gru from Despicable Me would say, \"Garbage.\" This tablet changes the price conscious end of Windows tablets.\n\nHARDWARE & DESIGN:\n\nThe Bay Trail series of Intel processors, while technically are of the Atom series are Atom only in name. The previous edition, Clover Trail that powered other Windows tablets was a clunky, power consuming poor performer. Intel has risen from the ash of Clover Trail and has a lightning fast quad core power sipper in the Bay Trail. This is partially why I stayed away from Windows tablets as their processors were either low end garbage or high end power hogs. Qualcomm Snapdragons they were not. For example, Photoshop CS loads in 8 seconds off a MicroSD card.\n\nWith a 2GB of RAM and either 32/64 GB of storage along with a decent mono speaker and a fairly responsive touch screen, this thing is a winner for the price. Front and back cameras are mediocre, but most people won't be using the cameras for anything high end anyways.  The screen is a relatively modest 1200x800 with just a 189 PPI which is nothing to write home. Compared to my Nexus 5 screen, it's hardly as sharp, but it will do the job.\n\nDid I mention there is a microSD slot? Oh yes. And it easily takes a 64GB card, more on this later when I get to Window 8.\n\nThe micro USB slot has USB Hosting enabled, meaning that USB OTG works. With an adapter, mice, keyboard, USB drives and other devices all work.\n\nBluetooth is also here and easily pairs with Bluetooth speaker, keyboards and mice.\n\nAs for physical buttons, there is the standard on/off, volume up/down rocker. The weird thing is the Windows \"Start\" Button is located on the top of the device. Some people find this strange, but I've found it works well as it's out of the way but still accessible.\n\nThe devices is fairly light, not as light as an iPad Mini 2, but if you're complaining about weight of light tablets, go hit the gym.\n\nThe markup on 64 GB from the 32 GB is high, but not Apple high. $70 for $16 in NAND from Dell/Amazon. $90 if you buy it from Microsoft. It may be worth it considering the device can run full Windows applications though.\n\nBattery life is about 8 hours on auto screen brightness on its 4,830 mAh battery and Bluetooth off. There is no GPS.\n\nI recently bought a MicroUSB to Ethernet cable. The DV8P will recognize and connect over a CAT5 cable.\n\nA downside is the device can only access the MicroUSB port for data or charging. Not both.\n\nSOFTWARE/WINDOWS:\n\nThis is full Windows 8.1. Not the gimped RT. That's $100 worth of OS right there. On top of that, Microsoft includes a full version of Office 2013 Student & Home, which includes Word, Excel, Powerpoint and One Note.  That's another $100 worth of software. Let's not forget that because it's full Windows, you can install any* existing Windows software. I say any* because Windows 8.1 has some issues with older software similar to all version of Windows. This makes up quite a bit for the relatively weak Microsoft App Store. With an external CD drive, it's cake to install games and programs. You may need to consult certain websites for no-CD fixes, but that's easy for even novice users.\n\nOh yes, because it's Windows, you can install whatever media program you want, from iTunes (I have no idea why you would do that, but you could), to the versatile KMP and VLC players. Thus, you can play whatever format you want. MKV? No problem. FLV? Got it. M2TS? Flying colors. This is incredibly refreshing compared to iOS. Oh, and because it's Windows, it's super easy to copy files to and from the device. Yes, that includes copying to USB drives. Apple? Google? They can't do that. Let's not forget full Photoshop.\n\nFurthermore, Microsoft seems to have heard the outcry over the Metro/Modern user interface (the tiles) and now you can automatically boot to desktop. However, that would miss out on a variety of features in Metro/Modern as well as PC controls that are centralized via the Metro/Modern interface.\n\nStill no classic Start Menu, but the free Classic Shell download can fix that easy. Once you get into desktop with the Classic Shell, it's just like Windows 7. Also you can access Metro/Modern apps in desktop mode via the start menu.\n\nWindows is a hefty fella, taking up about 20GB of storage. You can get back about 4GB by moving the recovery files to a USB drive. This may make it harder to restore your system though. Programs can be installed to a MicroSD card, but they do load slower.\n\nThat said, Windows is fast and responsive.\n\nThis is still Windows and its imperative not to run the system on administrator day to day.\n\nFor those interested in gaming, this tablet is fairly impressive. Team Fortress 2 is playable, Starcraft 2 is playable (no fastest maps though), Skyrim not really at 15 FPS, Sins of a Solar Empire plays well and Civilization 5 works marvelously.\n\nACCESSORIES:\n\nThere are plenty of cases, screen guards, etc on Amazon and eBay for very affordable prices. Also because USB Hosting is allowed via OTG, it's a simple matter of buying a $1 OTG cable and then plugging in mice, keyboards, flash drives and wall powered hard drives into your device.  I'm currently using the Meenova MicroSD reader to access my second MicroSD card.\n\nThere's a company selling a USB dock for tablets. They got a hold of a Dell Venue 8 Pro and were easily able to hook it up to four, yes, four LCD monitors natively, a keyboard and mouse to use it as a desktop replacement. This, my audience, is the future.\n\nNOW, WHAT YOU'RE REALLY WAITING FOR:\n\nNow...I know you're thinking, this is Windows. Something has to be wrong with it...and you know what? You're right. Luckily, they're entirely software rather than hardware.\n\nI previously mentioned the worst problem was the screwy WIFI sleep problem. This has been partially alleviated via Windows and DELL Bios updates. Now the issue is if you set your device to airplane mode and then leave it in airplane mode for an extended period of time you'll need to restart to get your WIFI back. If you just turn off WIFI, but do not turn on airplane mode, coming off sleep just turning on WIFI restores it.\n\nSecond problem for me is that running a limited account requires ANOTHER Microsoft account in addition to the one you registered the device on to use certain apps like Flipboard and Facebook. You can't just do the whole limited account like you can in Android 4.4 that just piggy backs on your existing account except without installation privileges. I guess you can't have everything on one device.\n\nThird problem I've noticed is that in Desktop mode because of the small screen, hitting the right box is hard. The little X for close is tiny and not all of us have pediatrician accuracy. I haven't tried the active stylus, but word is that Dell is fixing the software on that to deal with the problems it has. I guess this is a push to put more time in Metro/Modern.\n\nFourth issue relates to apps. Not only does the Microsoft App store suck, but it has apps that are otherwise free on iTunes and Google play that require payment. It's not that big of a deal as you can just log in via browser, but that isn't the real problem. The real problem is that Windows 8.1 has compatibility issues with other programs. Driver concerns, failure to load, controls that simply weren't coded for touch, the list goes on. It is possible to virtualize them, but that eats up resources.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS:\n\nConsider this device goes for $229 for the 32GB version or less if you have an easily attainable discount code, it's worth buying if you want to do anything more than movie watching and checking Facebook (Hey, yes, looking at you $500 to $2,000 Facebook machines...which I have). Full Windows and Office is huge on a tablet. Light, fast, easy to add storage and no format restrictions? Sign me up!  Now if they'd just fix that WIFI problem.\n\nFirst thing you should do when you get home is to update both Windows and DELL updates. Unlike Apple and Google, Windows didn't think it was a good idea to have the updates automatically run the first time the device boots. Most, if not all of the problems (other than defects) that people are having will be alleviated if you do this."}

I have had to straighten the pins several times with plugs that work in other products but not in the Dell Tablet. Secondly you can not just plug in external memory, other pc's or devices and expect them to be recognized by this system. Some of these problems come from their sensing circuit. For example, it does not see my usb external flash drive, but will see a mouse. It will not connect to a Win 7 homegroup (Microsoft issue). It will not recognize an external hard drive and will not charge off an airplane usb connection.

Also has microSD and small USB port. And 2 Gb of cloud storage. Store away, Garth!\n\nI saw online reviews that questioned the location of the Win 8 Home button (upper right corner in portrait mode rather than center in the bezel), but it's not an issue for me. First, I'm new to Win 8 so I don't have any set habits and, second, there are so many ways to get to the Home page in Win 8 I'm never reaching up there anyway.\n\nAbout Win 8. It seems to be the perfect system for one of these touchscreen tablets. It has all sorts of built in motions to move from program to app to internet and they all seem to be working really well. I'm not sure that I'd like Win 8 on my laptop or with anything that was centered on using a mouse, but for touchscreen computing it's nice.\n\nHad it a week and found no cons to this. I've paired it up with a Logitech Bluetooth tablet keyboard with a windows layout and I'm one happy camper."}

Try finding Bejeweled Twist at the Google Playstore or iTunes. With this tablet just go to Pop Cap and download it. You will need a mouse with some of the PC games. And...It comes with Office...FREE!\nThere are a couple of small issues that I'm having. When steaming music using my blue tooth speaker or headset it skips occasionally. When streaming video the movie has to buffer a few times before it will stream properly. One other thing...The print is so small. I probably should have opted for a bigger screen.

Sometimes I like to do the \"coffee shop thing\" and work away from my office. My previous tablet was a nexus 7 (2012). It has been great in every way, but two: 1. No flash player...grrrr 2. Any app for productivity just did not really cut it. I use Word and Powerpoint frequently and none of the apps really did a great job, in my opinion,\n\nSo, I see all the ads and reviews and really wanted the Dell Venue 8 pro to do that for me...and it does...sort of...Let's begin with the good:\n\n1. Solid hardware, great screen, build quality etc\n2. The little desktop really works, yes touch is difficult, but it works!\n3. Word and Powerpoint = they work...I like it!!!!\n4. Fast! Browsing the web is an excellent experience if you use explorer, boots up quick, snappy and fast loading of apps etc\n\nThe not so good: And if Dell and Microsoft read these...please work on this...I really want to like this product!\n\n1. Microsoft and Google not playing well in the same sandbox. What do you mean the mail app syncs with Gmail but the Calendar app will not sync with Google Calendar???? That is so aggravating! There is no good way to use Google calendar...which has all my life on it!!! Yes, I can use it in the web browser...but the point is to have a nice optimized snappy app to use, that even works off-line...like that nice one I use on my  Nexus 7 !!!\n\n2. Most of the apps: News, Weather, Flip Board, Facebook, Mail etc. Work really well...the problem is that the font size in all these apps cannot be changed on this screen. The settings are there to make the font size bigger...but they have been disabled...Why??? Most of these display the font in about 5pt !!!! The excellent screen makes it readable, but holy cow it is small!!! And you cannot do anything to change that.?? Everything on the Nexus tablet is optimized for a 7 inch screen, all very nice and readable, pictures, font size...it all just works beautifully...Not so in the Dell Venue 8 pro. It seems to get the desktop with full window 8.1 you have to compromise with a tablet experience that is NOT designed to work well on a small screen. It seems to me if Google can get this right on a small screen, surely Microsoft can too...please?\n\nWell, I appreciate all the reviews. I wanted this to be stellar, but I'm just a little frustrated. Right now I'm carrying around two tablets to do what I need. That totally defeats my purpose, I'm keeping the Dell in hope that future windows updates (windows 9?) will address the small screen factor...here is hoping!"}

If you type a letter it would type 8 or 10. Very frustrating when trying to enter passwords. Contacted Dell and spent approximately 1 hour on the phone. Factory reset, allowed tech access to tablet who performed several updates. Seemed to work ok for a few days.\n\nNext problem that showed up was loss of wifi. It said the adapter was active however, it found no networks in my house. Contacted Dell again. Another 45 minute call, hard reset with tech. Gave tech access again and several more updates and bios updates installed. Worked ok for a few more days.\n\nNext and current problem unit battery died. Connected wall charger and after about 30 minutes tried to turn it on, Tablet gets to Dell logo screen and won't continue boot up.\nContacted Dell again. Tech attempted hard reset it didn't work. Tech had me try to do another factory reset, unit would not go past Dell logo screen. 30 minutes later tech said unit possibly has bad mother board and needs to be sent back to Dell. He said a shipping box is being mailed and unit will be repaired under warranty.\nReally wanted to like this tablet but it was a real letdown. Every factory reset removes all personal files, pictures etc.\nI would never trust this thing to store any data of value.\nHopefully unit will work long enough when it comes back so I can unload it on Craigslist and use that money to buy a tablet of better quality."}

I haven't had any of the wifi issues I've seen mentioned in other reviews and I'm wondering if that was also resolved in a one of those driver updates.\n\nMany view tablets as a consumption device, but why spend $229 on  a Nexus 7 (which is a great consumption tablet) when this is good at both for the same cost, or a little more if opting for the 64gb model. I use metro apps for consumption (ie.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "Everyone knows that Windows 8 sucks on a tablet, right?  That's what I kept being told.  I got this because, for the money, it had a lot of great features such as the ability to use USB devices and upgrade the already substantial 64G of storage.  I was aware of how bad Windows was for a tablet was supposed to be.  But, I thought I'd try it out for myself.  I am sure I could suffer through it.  Worse case, this tablet could just be a toy why I continue to use my iPad as my real tablet appliance.  Well, after owning this thing for 3 weeks, I can tell you I have haven't touched my iPad once.  This tablet does everything I need and a whole lot more than I ever expected.  Hook up to media servers in my house, no problem.  Print using my network printer, no problem.  Browse any page on the internet, no problem.  And, most importantly, if I notice that I made a typing mistake 5 characters ago I can non-destructively backspace to the error and fix it!  I love this thing!  Of course, I am not the type that cares about the ten billion free apps that allow birds to flap.  So, that feature is pretty meaningless to me.  But, I do like to have all of my work handy and accessible from my tablet.  Windows and this tablet make that so easy.  Plus all of the built in productivity apps are much better than I expected.  I loved my iPad.  It had some limits but it did bring a lot of accessibility to things that I never had before.  It was great but I had no idea that I would like this thing so much more.\n\nOf course, nothing is that perfect.  The only real negatives I can say is that you really don't want to use your finger to run the desktop.  Most things on the Window's desktop that weren't design for touch really need a Bluetooth mouse or nice stylus to run.  You certainly can run any Windows program you want on it.  I have friend that is actual using it with Visual Studio 2013.  It has plenty of horsepower to handle even programs like that.  (I have no idea how he can run that IDE on such a small screen though).  That's brings me to my other negative.  It has no HDMI output on it.  When I bought this model I thought why in the world would I ever want to hook this thing to a big screen.  But, now I love it so much that I want to use it for everything I do at work.  Including projecting presentations and everything.\n\nAnyway, that's my story of the first 3 weeks with this device.  I am really shocked at how well it performs, how great Windows 8 is, and how much I use this thing.  I literally carry it with me almost everywhere I go.  It is small enough to fit into my jacket pocket and it travel's with me everywhere.  (I'd cry if someone broke into my car and stole it)."}

I have owned one of these for about a week and love it. It is even suitable for some older (Half Life 2 era) gaming on high with great performance. I have yet to put it through its paces with later offerings such as Portal or the infamous Crysis test. The only limitation I have with this product is that the shared power/USB port only allows either charging the battery or running accessories on the USB hub from battery. For example, this essentially means an 8 hour time limit on wired keyboards, wired mice, and external drives.

Called Dell and the customer service representative was on the phone for an hour having me push the power button on and off and nothing happened.  Sent it back to Dell to be fixed and so far haven't sent it back on time with the repair as promised.  Dell is as reliable as they have always been with their equipment, crap.  Should have spent the extra hundred and gone with the Lenovo, that's quality computer, and love my laptop from them.  It's a total waste of your money and there's probably better tablets that you can spend your money on.  Dell sucks.\n\nI called Dell back on 2/24/14 due to seeing they put another hold on my tablet because they were waiting for parts, not following through and fixing it on time.  I called them back told them this is getting to long to wait for a brand new tablet and to send me a new one in place of this one.  Two representatives promised me on that day that they would send me a new one and contact me in 48 hours.  So far no contact and see at Dell depot they're continuing the repairs and not sending me new replacement.  They are very successful at being very good to lying to their customers and cannot tell you the truth.  I tried to post a review of this whole situation on their own website, it states they'd get back to you in 48 hours, they didn't allow it to be posted.  Tells you the pick and chose what reviews are allowed to be posted and only the ones they like.  Which I think the FCC or FTC should look into this which is considered false advertisement.  I'm going to look into filing a complaint to the state attorney general.  Part of this is that a phone call and promise to send a new product is a legal obligation on anything that's recorded, meaning a legal contract that Dell is not following through.  I strongly recommend anyone looking in purchasing this product should strongly consider that Dell will not follow through with their legal obligations.  If for any reason your product fails Dell will not due anything to help\nsatisfy their customers.\n\nAt this point now its2/26/14 and no call back and not contact have filed a complaint about this situation with the attorney general in Florida, hopefully a consumer complaint can prove to be fruitful so that no other consumers of Dell has to deal with this type of bad customer service.\n\nFinally again am being promised a new replacement, but will have to wait another 7-10 business days to get the replacement. They should have replaced it up front when it was brand new and no fault to the consumer when it was a defective product.  As a consumer you shouldn't beg and plea if a company wants to stand behind their products and for the customers.  I do hope that no other person should or have to deal with this type of situation and will learn from my situation.\n\nI did hear a comment from someone who read my review and they do have a point that I didn't state how well the tablet worked.  I thought it ran excellent and was quite impressed in how well it functioned.  I really no problems with the tablet and was really enjoying it with using it for books, don't like to read on a computer or laptop.  The main reason I don't think they're should be to much bragging about a product that failed so quickly and to still not have a replacement for using it for one week.  I did receive an e-mail from the attorney general in Florida and will be submitting my signed paperwork and was promised that they would be in contact with Dell about this situation.  They will receive all my e-mails and a letter stating the continuous conversations that I had with Dell to get this resolved.  I really feel sorry about purchasing this product and should have spent the extra hundred and bought the Lenovo version, own their laptop and have been blown away by the way quality and workmanship of their product.\n\nWell people to continue this never ending saga, I received another new tablet from Dell and two weeks later now it won't recharge AGAIN!!!  I have to send it back to depot to and wait over 17 days to have it fixed and if this doesn't work then they'll send me a new one again.  Dell is, and hate to be impolite, crap.  I'm trying to warn people please don't be suckered and buying this product and waste your time.  BUY LENOVO'S tablet instead.  Better to by with a company that makes quality equipment and worth the extra 100 dollars for it.  I can guarantee from experience with this product you'll be without it working then being able to use it and you'll be wasting your money.  How can a rate how well it works when it doesn't work 95% of the time I've owned it.\n\nReceived the tablet back and now two weeks later it won't maintain an internet connection, keep switching to proxy server.  No mater how many times I keep setting it back it keeps looking for a proxy server and won't allow me to have an internet connection.  Sorry people but I do not know to tell you how unreliable this is.  Since I bought this back in February I have had it only working properly for a total of three weeks of ownership.

Windows 8 was difficult on a laptop with no touch screen but on this tablet, once learned, it is really easy and fast. Plays nicely with all of my PC based equipment (NAS, Xbox, flash drives, etc...) and is very light and portable with a full blown windows op system. There are some great built in apps that I was pleasantly surprised with (Meal planner/shopping list, exercise tracker and more).  Very happy I went with the Dell."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I didn't hate it which is one star. The two stars are because it's just too small for productive work both with screen viewing and onscreen typing.  You can increase the screen resolution to make it larger but that cuts off a lot, and then large fingers cover two keys on the keyboard. Get a stylus, but that's not good for typing quickly.  I could have bought a blue tooth keyboard, but if I'm constantly having my head down closer to the screen with reading glasses to see what I'm typing, what's the point.  Structurally, it's a tough, little tablet and great with full Windows 8 and Office, but perhaps more suitable for the younger generation with better eyesight and smaller fingers."}

Easy to use and don't let the talk about \"lack of apps\" for Windows sway your decision. Just because Google Play claims to have over 1 million apps doesn't mean they're better...in fact many of them are junk in my opinion, not to mention the privacy issues with Google.\nWindows app store has all the popular apps most people will ever use.\n\nThe ability to run full Windows programs including office make this a winner.\nI love this tablet and recommend it highly."}

I had to contact Dell support to figure out what happened.  They had me do some tests, like holding the power button down for 30 seconds, or plug and unplug the power cord so see if the power LED came on or not (it didn't) and after all that, they thought the issue was either the power supply or the motherboard.  They have arranged for it to be shipped back -- at their expense, so they are handling this in a reasonable manner.\n\nI have owned three Dell computers and never had any issues with them.  I really was hoping this tablet was going to work.  Maybe they will repair it or replace it, and maybe I'll get a few years of reliable use out of it."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I let the unit charge for 24 hours right out of the box without even turning it on. After a good charge, I turned it on and set the unit up. Messed around with email and browsed the internet all in total maybe an hour of usage. Turned the unit off to conserve battery(yes I know the difference between standby and off). Picked it up 2 days later and turned it on and it immediately starts a Windows update. No indication that there was anything wrong and then it just went blank and would not turn back on. I plugged the unit back in and then turned it on and the battery was dead. Left it charging and the unit completed the update. Went back 8 hours later and the unit was a little over half charged. Sorry Dell, but if I get a dud out of the box, I'm not trying my luck with a second unit. Other than the battery/charging issues, I liked the tablet and the OS. Worked smoothly and responsive to my touch however fat man fingers don't always hit the right thing. Anyway, if not for the fact I had to return it due to the battery/charging issues, I would have given it another star. Decided to try out the Asus T100TA-C1-GR instead. I noticed Amazon sells this on Prime for $482.++ and my local Wal-Mart sells the same unit, yes I double checked the specs, the same unit for $379.00 so I bought it there.

Always good to have more storage.  Fairly easy to hold in my left hand while typing with a finger or stylus.  Clear and good picture quality.  The Dell Venue Pro 8 I bought came with a Dell cover that was OK - not pretty, just a black hard plastic cover with a soft inside to protect the screen.  The cover has a loop for a stylus, something I like having with tablet covers.\n\nThe bad: Three stars because I found that I simply HATE Windows 8.1.  Just no other way to say it.  Win 8 had me stomped.  Took too long to figure out the simplest tasks.  Perhaps part of the problem is that the 8 inch screen is just too small for Windows 8, or it could be that I was hoping Windows 8 would be somewhat more like Windows 7 underneath  and it is to some extent with the old settings windows (Control Panel), etc. Could not pair it with my Anker Bluetooth keyboard (five stars!), bought here at Amazon.\n\nI finally managed to find my way around the tablet, but after a long day trying to figure out the basics, I gave up - it had not been a good experience.  Windows 8 is NOT intuitive, and in my opinion, not user friendly, although I understand that they have made some improvements in Win 8.1 from the original Win 8.  Yet the OS is awkward and so different from any other Microsoft OS that next time I need a new laptop, I am going with an Apple.\n\nBefore getting the Dell Venue Pro 8, I tried, during a three week period:\n\niPod touch 5th gen, Kindle Fire HDX 8\" and iPad Mini, all three five stars, by the way.  Decided to return the former two and thanked my daughter for letting me play with her iPad mini.  I went back to Nexus 7 and bought the new 2013 version instead.\n\nDell Venue Pro 8 might be a good tablet for someone who is willing to spend more time learning Win 8 than I was.  Win 8 has potential, but the OS needs to be easier to use, especially on a small 8\" tablet.  Perhaps my experience with Win 8 would have been better on a much larger screen, and if I had put in more time to learn it - I am willing to admit as much.  :-)"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "By far, this is the best 8-inch hand-held tablet on the market, including the much ballyhooed iPad Mini.  This is a device with which youj can actually do work!  It is powerful enough to be responsive, with good Wi-Fi speeds, and gives  you the ability to use Windows in traditional \"desktop\" mode, or by swiping to the \"apps\" view where you touch the screen to play games, check bank account, take photos, play music, etc. The apps are not as numerous, but there are plenty enough to have fun and enjoy watching movies, etc.\n  I was hesitant to but given the incredible bias in favor of Apple devices. However, I say without reservation that this table it handy, useful, better sharper screen display, and fun.  You can use the real Microsoft Office on this table. A definite advantage over the iPads.\n  Dell has done a great job of incorporating Windows 8.1. A Dell keyboard is optional for those who want a more regular experience while typing."}

Will update if and when Dell resolves issues including stability, screen calibration, stuttering video camera issues, plus OS stability\n\nUpdate: Feb 26/14\nHad to return unit for repair. Most difficult item was actually getting a phone contact for warranty service. It was very difficult to find the info on Dell site, but once located the contact was very polite and efficient. Obviously an off shore call center but no prob communicating. Dell sent me a return paid Fedex shipping container and they acknowledged receipt of returned unit within 48 hours. Was repaired and shipped back within 1 business day, and received the following day. Good automated contact info re status of unit repair process Only documentation returned with the unit was a list with only repair listed was reinstallation of the w8.1 OS but that seems to have done the trick -all issues seem resolved- so far. Still concerned about back up process for the OS- Recovery partition- not saving it to a USB, but actually being able to access it on USB if system crashes. There are ways of doing it that either require a complicated build of a restore disk or use of a 'jury rigged' USB connection that will supply power and connection of thumb drive to the USB simultaneously. Makes an interesting project. Will update in another few weeks.\n\nUpdate, Mar 14\nContinue to explore unit features. Has been stable since service by Dell. Following observations:\nGoogle chrome now works somewhat better with pinch/zoom working, but auto caps not. more stable than default IE.\n\nTouchscreen keyboard still a little flaky, either popping up when it should not (Google Voice keypad gets covered)or not able to move out of way ?(either keyboard or input field)\n\nScreen real estate is at a premium on all these small tablets and W8 interface is obviously designed for a larger screen (laptop) hence many active touch spots are very small and either do not respond or the adjoining spot activates in error. You need a stylus for much of the navigation. Find the android units are better in this aspect. Even my old Rim Playbook is superior.\n\nBluetooth mouse works well.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "When I first started using it I honestly didn't like Windows 8 as a touch screen OS. Kind of odd, I love it on a desktop with a mouse and keyboard and don't understand peoples complaints now that they have have 8.1 but honestly most Windows programs don't work well on a tablet. The icons and menu links are hard to just touch and use, I need to get better trained at how to do things on a touch screen like how you do the equivalent of a right mouse click and just get these new functions locked in so they are more natural.\n\nPerformance wise this tablet has been close to flawless but there have been a few annoyances. I have a car stereo with no CD but a USB, flashcard and 3.5 mm input. It was kind of hard navigating through mp3s with the stereo controls so I got a dashboard/windows holder and this tablet to fix that problem The first time I hooked the tablet to the stereo I noticed a clicking sound and some static usually on music with strong bass. At first I thought it was the cable but then I noticed the static through the built in speakers. The clicking went away the next day after I updated all the updates but the static is still there. Oddly none of these things exist when I am using any Bluetooth device to listen to this tablet so now I am thinking maybe dell took short cuts on the digital to analog circuitry on this tablet.\n\nLike I said a lot of Windows programs don't work well with touchscreen especially when the screen is this small. A few things also don't scale down well to this screen size. I use this keyboard with this tablet and it works excellent. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00E1MRYK2/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_14\n\nI've been using a Logitech mouse with it but have on order as of a few minutes ago a Bluetooth mouse from Microsoft. I have a OTG USB adapter and use that for the mouse dongle now, will be happy when the Bluetooth mouse gets here to open that to be used for flashdrives.\n\nI have a 64 GB Sony Micro SDXC card hooked up and honestly the 32 GB is plenty if you make use of the space on the card and use your head. I also have the use of the USB with flash drives I have almost unlimited storage and still in a very portable format.\n\nBesides the audio problems the build quality seems excellent. The charger cable seems to be the one weakness as it is a little on the cheap side but beside that it feels like the build quality of tablets twice the price. It also performs very well as a computer, I think it performs better than my Windows 7 Toshiba laptop from five years ago and my wife's which is two years old. (Turns out the keyboard also uses the same type cable for charging and I have two Samsung cables that are also the same, this is a bonus now that I can leave charger cables where I use the tablet the most so even if the battery dies I still have access to power.)\n\nI'm still waiting on my HDMI dongle for Miracast and may do an update once that comes and I can see how this functions on my 55\" screen.\n\nOK, it is Feb 18 and I have used it a couple more days. First some of the audio problems were my car stereo which is now dying and being replaced today with a Pioneer with built in Bluetooth mostly for streaming from this tablet. Really cool thing, listening to music in the car, turn the radio off and the music still plays on the tablet while I walk into my house and I will soon have my stereo in my house set up with a Bluetooth receiver so I just turn the power on and set it to the AUX with the Bluetooth and the music continues to play with brief moments of silence as it changes connections from car stereo, built in speakers, to home stereo automatically with me just turning them on and off, also the choice of my Bluetooth headphones. This setup can be done with any tablet or smart phone with Bluetooth that will allow you to stream music from its memory. It is also great that I can transfer movies to the SD card or flash drive and my kid can watch them where ever we go.\n\nOne thing that I noticed is I have a 12 volt adapter in my card with two USB ports and some reason either the amperage or voltage isn't right and this tablet won't charge from them. Sad my phones have and my GPS does. Well I found a quick fix for all my problems as I found a cup holder inverter that will give me one AC plug for the tablet charger and five USB plugs for my GPS and other things, I will also now be able to use my charger for my camera batteries so it is a win win situation.\n\nI have had a few glitches in the performance of the tablet, today it had some type of error on start up and went into a system screen. I restarted it and it worked fine. When I got home I went to My Dell and did any updates and checked Windows for updates. Some of the apps have acted up but that is true in iOS and Android at least the devices I have used with those OS's. I do have multiple devices in my house with Android 4.0, and 4.1. I've used iPads and iPhones just never saw anything to justify the price or contract. Yes they have better apps but this does more as a computer than they are capable of and is just as portable as them and more portable than a laptop. Android devices are great for fitting your use devices, I use them for things I don't want to risk a $150 or more device to do. As far as most devices over $150 I think on Android they are over priced with few exceptions. The newest Nexus Tablets by Google/Asus and the Fire HDX are great tablets for their price if they have the software you want for your needs. Aweson screens, good CPUs and with the small footprint of Android if setup and used correctly they are very powerful machines for the buck, as is this this series of tablet from Dell, the Toshiba models that are similar and even Lenovo although both of them usually cost more. I think the Toshiba has the better build quality but not sure it is different enough to justify the price difference. That is why I got the Dell, I just couldn't pull the trigger on the $40 to $50 price difference when this tablet also seems to be built very well and had a few things in the way it looked and felt in my hand that just said to me buy this one.\n\nIf you read this and you know of any media player and other apps that work better on these small touch screens please let me know with a comment on here. There is a program Blue Stack that lets you use Android apps. Sometimes you have scaling issues with them but most work great that I have tried. Guess that about wraps up this update if anything changes I will probably update again...\n\n(February 23, 2014)\nOK, part of the sound problem did turn out to be my car stereo which was a cheap unit my wife bought me for Christmas, I was hoping would last two years or so until I got a new car. Don't buy Boss car audio equipment, I knew it was garbage going in but turns out it is even worse than I previously thought.\n\nWindows updates seem to of fixed the sound problems that where through the tablet speakers as it doesn't sound great but sounds better, built in speakers still have a problem with lack of bass and terrible sound especially on things with bass, but that is easily fixed with ear buds, external speakers or Bluetooth devices.\n\nI now have a Pioneer head unit in my car with Bluetooth. This along with my tablet sound great together and integrate very well. Still looking for a better media player app for use with touch screen. Occasionally I have noticed that when I have it on the Xbox Music Player the swipe feature looks up and I can't get back to the start menu or desktop. To fix this I need to turn off the tablet and turn it back on. Not sure of this is the tablet, Windows or a glitch in the app.\n\nI got the cup holder inverter, USB power supply I was talking about and using this the tablet actually charges from the USB port so bonus the 110v outlet can be used for my battery charger for AA and AAA batteries for the two cameras we have on road trips or the walkie talkie radios we have. This is the perfect accessory for this tablet if you have a car or truck that doesn't have USB ports or  110v outlet and you take road trips with your family. It is a small inverter with a low wattage rating but it is good for little things like battery chargers. It seems well made and is fairly reasonably priced.\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ATXEPQI/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\n\nI have added the Bluetooth mouse to using with this along with the previously mentioned keyboard and honestly for the dollar I like this mouse for use with Windows 8 & 8.1 more than any mouse I have used including the more costly Microsoft ones.\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BZC31WQ/ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i01?ie=UTF8&psc=1\n\nI'm using this screen protector http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HJ6WEAC/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 and it seems to be working well. It was very easy to put on with no bubbles...\n\nAs far as the Miracast I still haven't gotten to use it yet. The HDMI dongle I ordered still hasn't gotten here yet. I think it is being shipped from China.  Estimated delivery Monday, March 10, 2014 - Wednesday, March 26, 2014 by 8:00pm Shipped"}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "It is difficult to review the Dell Venue 8 Pro tablet without getting into a debate of the merits versus the detriments of the Windows 8 Operating System. Not since Windows Vista has an OS from Microsoft caused this much controversy, and with good reason. Windows 8 is different. So different that it appears to have left users in one of 2 camps. Either you love Windows 8 or you loathe it.\n\nUnderstanding the reasons behind the divisiveness of users' opinions towards Windows 8 is pivotal in understanding how this tablet from Dell is either perfect for you or one that you should stay away from. Surely, I could review this tablet based entirely on the merits of its hardware alone, but that would be deceptive to the potential customers interested in purchasing it. As such, I will attempt to review this device taking into consideration the entire experience.\n\nUpon first handling the Dell Venue 8 Pro from the box, one notices the solid yet pleasingly lightweight feel of the device. Unlike some other small tablets that eschew metals for light weight plastics, this device doesn't feel cheaply constructed like some of them do. The subtle yet noticeable texture of concentric circles on the back of the device is a welcome touch. The back feels like it is coated in rubber and that slight feeling of friction evokes confidence when holding the unit. The weight of the unit, at 0.87lbs, feels just right in the hand and easily allows for extended periods of use. The device is also very slim at 0.35\" which adds to its allure. Overall I found the build quality to be on par with a premium Tablet product like the iPad Mini. Although it is still made from plastic and glass, there are no creaks to be heard on this device.\n\nThere is nothing revolutionary about the ports that come standard on the device. You get 1 x Micro USB port for charging, 1 x Micro SD Card slot hiding under a small plastic tab, and one combo Headphone/Microphone port. Note that Dell also sells a model with a SIM card slot compatible with ATT cellular networks. A nice addition, since many small tablets fail to offer cellular solutions even though In my opinion they are a perfect form factor for use on cellular networks. The model I'm reviewing did not have this feature.\n\nBesides these ports, the tablet has a standard volume rocker and a power button on the right hand side when held vertically; on the top when held in landscape. One curious addition to the buttons on the tablet is a dedicated Windows button located on the top when held vertically or the left when held in landscape. Pressing this button brings the user back to the Windows home screen. More on this feature later. The ports included on the device are fine although I would have preferred a full sized USB port instead of the Micro one, however one can purchase an adapter that will allow you to connect standard sized USB devices such as a wired USB gamepad. I tested an Xbox 360 wired controller on the device with this adapter and it worked just fine.\n\nFinally, there is both a forward facing 1.2MP camera as well as 5MP shooter on the rear. The cameras are decent enough shooters for those that need to use Skype, and/or take the occasional snapshot. Im not much of a photo bug and as such don't feel qualified to judge the merits of these cameras. To be honest, Im in the camp of people that uses a cell phone cam for all picture taking and cant understand the need to have cameras on Tablets, but hey, to each their own.\n\nIn the end, Tablets are portable computing devices with all the components contained within the display. As such, the display is the main point of interaction with the end user and a fair amount of attention should go into the engineering of said displays. As obvious as this may seem to most, trust me when I say that not all companies consider this when manufacturing their tablets. (Im looking at you Archos Gamepad) With the Dell Venue 8 Pro, you have an 8\" IPS display with a resolution of 1280 x 800. On paper this may appear to be low in comparison to other small tablets with higher displays such as the iPad mini with Retina (2048 x 1536) and the Nexus 7 (1920 x 1200) before it, and you would be right. However in real world use, I have found that a tablet at this size, (7\"-8\") with a higher resolution, may be more of a negative than a positive. Watching HD videos seemed just as crisp on this device as on those other devices. Since a majority of people cannot tell the difference between 720p and 1080p, the point becomes mute. If one is to look to the near future however, we will one day soon be consuming media at much higher resolutions (4K anyone?) and wonder how it was that we \"got by\" watching content on such low resolutions. A valid point for 2016 maybe but right now, I do not see a need to prepare for content that is at least a couple of years away from being as ubiquitous as HD is today. One point of contention I do have is that the brightness in this display did not seem to be on par with the competition and the Dell Venue 8 Pro screen always seemed to be a bit dimmer than it should be. Part of this is probably related to the need to offset the power consumption for better battery life, a concern that many have had with the initial crop of Windows tablets and one that has seemed to have been addressed in the current Haswell and Baytrail versions. Overall the display is very nice and responsive to the touch and the primary colors of the live tiles from Windows 8 seem to pop from the screen nicely enough all things considered.\n\nThe Venue 8 Pro comes with 2GB of RAM which seems just fine with normal usage. It is easy to forget however that even though this is a tablet, it is also a full fledged Windows computer. Unlike most lightweight tablet apps that run on Apples IOS and Googles Android, one could potentially run desktop applications that could ultimately cause a slowdown in performance. Even though the newer Baytrail processor has been optimized to perform better, it is still based on the same Atom CPUs used previously in Netbooks, so don't expect to break any performance records. Overall for casual computing, the tablet performs very well and I have few complaints about its performance. I have noticed that it can get a little warm during graphics intensive operations but not uncomfortably so.\n\nStorage wise, the Dell Venue 8 Pro comes in either 32GB or 64GB internally. I chose the 64GB as again, we are dealing with a full version of Windows here so demands on resources are high. With an optional 64GB SD card, you can get up to 128GB of storage for the around $350. Not bad when you compare a similarly specd iPad mini to run closer to $900. The price to performance ratio on this device is probably reason enough for many people to choose it over some of its competitors. That and the freedom this device offers over the iPads and Android devices that it competes with. When I use the word freedom, I mean to say that the Venue 8 Pro does not have a locked down ecosystem like an iPad. Nor does it have an Operating System that is incompatible with the majority of desktop software that you currently use, as is the average Android tablet. The major benefit to a Windows 8 tablet is that it is a fully functional Windows 8 computer. Where most tablets have been optimized for the tablet experience only, the Dell Venue 8 Pro as well as other Windows 8 tablets, are meant to allow the user to install full blown Windows applications. This is both a blessing and a curse and the reason why I ultimately cannot recommend this device for most tablet users.\n\nAlthough many people first think of companies like Apple and Samsung when it comes to tablets, I remember back in 2002, when Microsoft attempted to define the category of the Tablet PC. They ultimately failed but it had more to do with the technical limitations of the day and less with the overall concept. The Tablets in 2002 were thick and heavy and only lasted for a couple of hours at best. These limitations coupled with the fact that Microsoft was essentially shoe-horning Windows XP into a tablet interface, led to their early demise.\n\nMicrosoft has come a long way since then and with a strong list of hardware partners in addition to some great in house engineering efforts of their own, are now offering a much better user experience than back in 2002. But have they really changed that much? Windows 8 presents itself as a tablet Operating System. With big bright tiles on the start screen, the OS is tailor made for the touch experience.almost. The problem is that Windows 8 tries to be a tablet OS but also wants to be a traditional Desktop OS. Many of its features still require the desktop mode that resembles and behaves like the desktop on Windows 7, only more obfuscated.  Many features that customers of the previous versions of Windows were accustomed to are now hidden and require a search to find; one of the most popular of which being the Start Menu. In what appears to be back peddling, Microsoft has promised to bring back the Start Menu via an update to be released shortly. I believe, however, that this fails to address the real problem.\n\nThe real problem is that Windows 8 is attempting to be too many things and not doing any of them particularly well. Oh sure, the Windows live tiles are great for getting updated information quickly, but not all apps are written in this new Metro interface so youll find more often than not, youll be going right back to the desktop mode for operation. Its not that desktop mode is such a bad thing. It does allow you to run all of the Windows applications that you do on your desktop\\laptop as you normally could. As nice as this sounds, many Windows apps (including Microsoft Office) just aren't meant to run on a touch screen; especially not one only 8 across diagonally. The resulting effect is an exercise in frustration as you attempt and fail to activate on screen controls and buttons that are way too small to make contact with correctly. This often leads to nothing happening or worse, the wrong thing happening at the wrong time.\n\nWhen Steve Jobs was alive and was commenting on how he would never produce a smaller tablet, he was quoted as saying that they would have to include sandpaper to file down human fingers to a quarter of their size. I now understand what he meant, and even though the iPad mini was eventually released, IOS does a great job of keeping most of the on screen controls big enough to be used comfortably. Windows 8, not so much.\n\nUltimately the Dell Venue 8 Pro and probably all of the existing and upcoming Windows 8 tablets will fail to find a sure footing with the modern tablet user. With a more simplified interface and thousands of more apps, both IOS and Android tablets provide a more frustration free experience. The nice hardware build by Dell, in this case becomes meaningless, when the ultimate user experience isn't all that great."}

After my husband opened it for Christmas it never worked right, but he kept thinking that maybe he didn't understand how to use it.  After a few weeks he began the process of communicating with Dell and sending the tablet it back and forth.  They sent letters indicating they fixed the problem.  They replaced the mother board, they changed the charger, etc. etc. They have never fixed the problem!  The thing will not keep a charge and never has.  In fact the plug falls out and doesn't seem to fit correctly. We asked for our money back or a new model because this is defective from the get go.  They say the warranty begins from the date this was ordered and is only for 30 days even though it is defective.  They say if you make Christmas purchases during the big sales right after Thanksgiving, the WARRANTY IS GONE BEFORE THE RECIPIENT EVEN OPENS UP THE GIFT!!!! We have discussed this with them at least 4 times and they keep saying the same thing, the 30 days warranty begins from the date of the invoice.

I upgraded the bios and everything else in hopes that the character duplication would cease and the screen itself would recognize touch with accuracy.  The tablet is rendered useless to me as the usability did not improve.  I wish it would have been a better experience.  The cost based on the memory, flash storage, cpu, etc is the best in comparing other products.  None of this matters if the tablet does not work as it is intended.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "Having spent the last few days playing around with the tablet, I am writing why one should NOT buy this tablet. Please READ this before making your purchase!\n\nThe night I got home I went to hook this thing up, within about ten mintues I had everything updated and installed. I am going to briefly explain why its not worth buying.\n\n1.  The colors. Its simply not acceptable. When you buy an android tablet you have fixed gamma, contrast, and color saturation. You cant change your screen.  With this windows tablet, if you go into the desktop mode hold down anywhere on the desktop for two second and release, and then click graphic properties, you have the option of going to display, clicking on color and adjusting the screen exactly as you see fit. This is WAY to confusing.\n\n2. The PPI.  The PPI is rated at 189. For a tablet thats low. HOwever when I got it out of the box and compared it side by side with the nexus 7, it looked higher. The texts were more black and the screen looked like it had higher contrast than my nexus 7 1st generation that was sitting right by its side. Something thats rated at 189 but looked cristal shap when viewing HD images at full resolution?  Thats deceptive marketing.\n\n3. Any 32 bit desktop PC program that you can install on your regular PC, you can install on the tablet.  Thats the problem though. It may not have all the apps that google market has, but you can install millions if not billions of PC programs on it, and microsoft still possess most basic apps like alarms, facebook, calculators, netflix, yahoo mail, news weather, flipboard etc. Its way too powerful. I hold it in my hand and look on all the other android users out there who don't posess it and feel a tinge of guilt. I shouldn't have to feel that way with a piece of technology in the palm of my hand. I'm a good person and its corrupting me.\n\n4 It fits in my cargo pocket. Again, were back to the issue of just too much power and feeling that guilt again for all the andoid users out there. You shouldnt be able to have windows desktop that beats the speed of desktop computers from 3-4 years ago and have access to all windows applications in your pocket, and still maintain a decent quite impressive baterry life. That and with an expandable micro SD slot, you have the ability to have virtually unlimited storage space for movies, pictures, music and other windows applications. Its not right.\n\nThere are many more negative things that can be said about owning a tablet like this, but that is not for me to decide. ALl I can do is decide what to do in the time that was given to me.  WHich right now happens to be popping some popcorn and enjoying Netflix on this awesome display."}

I also have a HP Touchpad that I liked, but the lack of support and current apps was always an issue.  Now I have everything in a current supported OS.  It is really neat once I learned the 'tricks' of moving between apps and I still am learning new ones.  The price point of this unit is a major plus also.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I'm writing this review after one week of using this tablet. I may update my review in the future!\n\nFirst off, I would caution anyone who isn't tech-oriented from purchasing this tablet. For casual users, the interface will not be so user friendly, such as a Kindle or iPad. This is primarily because this is a tablet that thinks it's a full PC. You will not be guided along by a simple interface, pushed updates/drivers, or the \"one size fits all\" simplicity of an iPad, but you will also not be limiting yourself to programs sold only in the app store. This \"tablet\" does the work of a full PC, and that is exactly why I purchased it.\n\n95% of the time, I only use my computer for email, Facebook, Netflix, etc. However, I needed something that could provide word processor, OneNote, and excel sheet capabilities for the rare opportunities I need to work from home. Additionally, having a sizable Steam library, anything able to run Steam games was a huge plus.\n\nThis \"tablet\" is able to fulfill all those functions and more. It will suffice to say that it fills the role of both tablet and laptop -- provided you buy a Bluetooth keyboard, mouse, and a microSD card.\n\nSo, if you are looking for something affordable, portable, and fast with a beautiful (albeit a little small) display and long battery life, then look no further than the Dell Venue 8. You'll be able to check your email, surf the web, watch movies, listen to music, or even play some classics on Steam."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I bought this tablet for my daughter, plus the 11-inch DELL tablet for my older son. In comparison I like the bigger tablet better for several reasons: better connectivity (USB3 interface, HDMI interface), higher resolution and larger screen. The larger screen is nice because certain buttons on websites or the scroll bar on the browser is also larger, which makes it easier to use. The resolution of the 8-inch tablet is quite good and the screen is very bright and makes a good impression. However, when you have the 11-inch tablet next to it you realize that the font is not as crisp as on the bigger tablet. My daughter loves the small tablet because it is pretty lightweight and easy for her to hold (this is for sure one of the downsides of the larger 11-inch tablet). What is not so practical is the lack of any useful interfaces. It would have been great to have, besides the micro-USB port for charging the tablet, also a proper USB3 interface like with the bigger tablet. For example, it is impossible (or not straightforward) to hook up an external DVD drive to the tablet, for example for installing software or burning a CD/DVD or watching a movie. This is because the micro-USB port does not provide any power for an external drive, while this is the case for the USB3 port on the 11-inch tablet. The backside cameras on both DELL tablets are pretty poor in my eyes, mainly due to the small size of the sensor. It would have been great to have a built-in flash or a better sensor. The camera is only really useful in bright-light conditions, unless you are happy with some noisy or grainy shots. In terms of user feeling and speed this tablet is great. Windows 8 runs smoothly and fast and I like the fact that it is basically a full-blown Windows computer in a tablet form factor, for example that you can run MS Office on it and use the tablet also for powerpoint presentations in school. Again, for such things the bigger 11-inch tablet will be better because of the built-in HDMI port."}

I've been doing that successfully for a few months on a Samsung 10.1 Note (Android). Both tablets are good pieces of hardware - the difference is the operating system.\n\nThe Dell uses Windows 8.1 which is so buttoned-down that it's crippled if you want to do anything other than play. It won't run the Cisco VPN (driver isn't digitally signed). I haven't been able to get the Shrew Soft VPN to work, either. You can't easily enable the built in administrator account.

Evidently, that involves re-installing windows from it's hidden partition. Afterwards, just for giggles, I re-installed the Cisco VPN. Still no joy. I un-installed the Cisco and re-installed the Shrew Soft VPN. This time, it worked and has continued to work! The OS re-install did the trick!\n\nOne interesting point, though. When I originally got the tablet, there were a raft of Dell driver updates to be installed. When I reset the tablet with the OS image that was included with the tablet, the newest drivers were included! It appears that the backup OS image was more up to date than the original installed OS. That said, I'd advise that anyone who buys one of these tablets, before doing anything else, reset it to factory state. I have the feeling that a good number of the complaints for this tablet are related to a bad OS install from the factory.\n\nWindows 8.1 still isn't as stable as what I work with every day (Windows 7 Pro), but it's usable.\n\nI see that it's possible for a user to replace his own battery.

No, miracast is not an option for a meeting when you have to walk up/speak/leave.\nVery disappointed in dell over this. Their tab could be nice but it totally failed for what I needed. It will be returned and I will stick with memory sticks onto a meeting computer (.ppt may fail, fonts change, etc.) or my android."}

Approximately two months after it was purchased the charging cord would not insert fully into the unit and it could no longer be charged.  We contacted Dell in order to obtain service  under the warranty. They asked for a service tag number which they said was located on a sticker on the bottom of the unit. There was no sticker on our unit which had been stored in a case since it was purchased.  Dell could not retrieve the number electronically since the unit could not be activated.  Without the service number, Dell would not honor the warranty.  This is a product with a one year warranty, that has only been on the market for approximately five months.

Compared to having to use a unique power adapter (e.g. Surface), this is so much better!\n6) Battery life seems to be okay, but not stellar. Enough for a day with moderate usage - similar to an average smart phone.\n\nCons:\n1) Volume button(s) is hard to find, because they are non-distinctive by touch, and are too close to power button.\n2) Auto screen brightness sometimes dims the screen too much. I turned it off, because I got annoyed too many times.\n3) The touch screen is a little bit too sensitive, and it mis-interprets a press-and-hold for tap/click. Again, too many times, I've launched something I didn't mean to.\n4) Built-in speaker is on one (short/bottom) side, so watching videos in landscape would require earphones for the best experience.\n5) Having no built-in kick-stand is a bummer!

Stop second-guessing yourself, weighing pros and cons, looking for reasons not to buy it, or whatever else.  This thing is awesome, and completely worth the price.  I will say, though, that 32GB is a little small, so if you intend on having this as your only computer and installing a number of Windows Store apps, I would recommend getting the 64GB version.  Also, I'm not sure what's going on with the Dell Active Stylus, but you can either wait until Dell puts them back out, or you can try to get one off the black market comprised of shady internet retail stores no one's ever heard of before.

The Surface isn't the lightest of things to hold for long periods, but the Venue 8 is a great alternative.\n\nFirst off the bat, the screen in the original \"automatic\" settings was way too dark.  You definitely will want to update the BIOS and turn off the \"automatic\" dimming setting in the Power/Display options.  You'll get less battery life from a brighter screen, but you're eyes will thank you for it.\n\nI also changed the power button mode from \"sleep\" to \"shutdown\".  Even from full shutdown, it boots up quite fast and you'll save a lot of \"standby\" time between charges.  If you're the type that always plugs it in, then you probably won't care about this.\n\nIt definitely has more battery life than my first generation Surface Pro, I haven't done any timed tests, but read that I can expect 6 or 7 hours of streaming video.  Not bad.\n\nThe unit is a hair under 1 lb and definitely lighter than the Surface Pro.  The screen is very clear, but at 8 IN you won't be wanting to do any real word processing, CAD or spreadsheets on this.  Facebook, Youtube and various websites are primarily what you will be doing on this.\n\nBut even at under 1 lb, holding it for long periods can be uncomfortable.  Still looking for a good case with a rotating hand grip, but haven't found a great one yet.  The back has a nice surface that isn't too slick or attractive to finger prints.  No kickstand on the back, so you'll be buying a case or holding this thing up.\n\nThe screen clarity is pretty good, though you'll want to change the DPI to 125% under display unless you have small fingers and excellent eyesight.\n\nThe volume is surprisingly loud for such a small device, but quality is about on par as any tablet.\n\nThe \"start\" button is on the side which isn't a bad thing.  The power button is right next to the volume rocker, which could be a pain as you can easily hit the power by mistake...wish it were textured or sunk down a bit to differentiate it from the volume rocker.\n\nThe manual says that there is a SD and SIM card, well no SIM reader in the Venue 8 Pro...but no surprise, it ain't Cellular capable.\n\nThe biggest annoyance is that it only has a micro-USB port (2.0).  Ok, understand there is no room for a full USB, but does mean you will need to buy an adaptor.  Also, USB 2.0 is slow (compared to USB 3.0).\n\nThe device is peppy, but the disk I/O seems pretty slow.  No, don't even think about using this a gaming tablet.  Sure you can load Steam (this is the full Windows 8.1 Pro, not crippled RT version), but the Atom processor with only 2 GB memory isn't up for heavy lifting.  Play your Facebook games fine, but use your Surface Pro 2 for \"Skyrim\".\n\nOh, and I was surprised that it game with a license key for the basic MS Office (Word, Excel and Powerpoint).  Nice plus.  Outlook would be nice, but the generic mail/calendar is OK.  Plus, Outlook 2013 was way too hard to use on the small screen of a Surface Pro, much less this 8 IN screen.\n\nI haven't played with the capacitive touch surface and figure I won't.  You have to buy the pen separately, and if I wanted to draw, I'd just use my Surface Pro with Sketchbook anyways.\n\nThe cameras are OK with no flash ability.  Good enough to post on Facebook or Skype, but you don't buy a tablet for good photos anyways.  There isn't any external video capability except some new wireless format that I can't test as I don't have a TV that supports it.\n\nBut in summary, it is a great consumption tablet if you aren't in the iPAD camp.  The price is right and it runs FULL Windows, so you can load any Windows program...just don't expect much as the processor and memory aren't able to do much heavy lifting."}

When I opened the box I was shocked, the front display and rear cover were covered with finger prints and smudges.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "This would have been a four-star review if I had written it a week ago.  At the time, the only issues I had were the internet explorer browser occasionally locking/crashing, and being unable to close and re-start IE when it locked up. Could not even swipe from the side to get to the home screen and open another program--I would have to power the entire unit off and then restart it in order to use the tablet again.  But I did not blame this on the tablet itself, assuming that perhaps this was just a Windows glitch after doing the recent update.\n\nStraight out of the box, it was just very slow to re-charge, and burned though battery life within a few hours, but this was not a deal-breaker for me.  Eventually, I found that it would die if left unused and unplugged for a day or two, but it would charge back up and still function after being plugged back in overnight.  But now it will not charge and has become an expensive paperweight after only 6 weeks of use!\n\nI have used ONLY the original charger (\"brick\" plug base and micro USB cord that came in Dell the box shipped from Amazon.)  As a longtime Blackberrry user, I am always very careful to plug micro USB cords in gently, with the USB oriented in the correct direction, and without forcing the connection.  I have never had one of these types of cables fail before, and the USB end of the charging cable appears fine.  Looking at the USB port on the Venue itself, there are no broken pins, nothing to explain why the charger is suddenly not working.  I tried several different wall sockets, to no avail. Also connected my Blackberry's micro-USB port to the Dell plug base/cable combo to make sure this was not the problem, and the phone was able to pull a charge just fine. The Venue does seem to pull some tiny level of charge, as the battery area on the case does get just warm enough to the touch to know something is happening, but it does not seem to be enough to power the tablet up. This leads me to believe that the Venue 8 Pro itself is the issue--not the charging base, not the USB cable, not my wall outlets, and not user error.\n\nI have now left it plugged in (using the original charger, as noted) for three entire days, and still only get a few seconds of an amber glow at the charge indicator light, and only if I press the power button.  The light never turns white, and the unit will not power back on even while still plugged in. Searching Microsoft forums for tips, some users with a similar experience said they could get the unit to turn back on by holding the power button for a longer time, or holding it while pushing the volume or windows buttons simultaneously, and so forth; none of those tricks are working on my Venue so far.\n\nHaving now read more reviews at Amazon and elsewhere, it seems I am not the only person to have the same problem. Some users feel the micro-A port combined with a micro-B charger is the problem, and I'm starting to wonder if this is indeed a design flaw.  Wish I had read more of these reviews before making this purchase.\n\nReally disappointed that I am going to have to return this, because I was so thrilled about finally having a tablet that could run MS Office programs, run Firefox, and actually multi-task with more than one program/window open on the screen at one time (unlike my iPad.)  The main dilemma now is that I cannot wipe my personal information from the unit before sending it for repair/replacement--because I can't even turn it on!\n\n***July 2015 update:  I give up!\n\nThe unit was repaired by Dell, and worked OK for a number of months after that.  Then the Dell-supplied cable failed.  I switched to one of my old BlackBerry charging cables, which works just fine.  During its final days, the Dell cable began taking longer to charge the unit, and the micro USB end started to wiggle like a loose tooth, which made me worry about it shorting out or starting a fire.  And trust me, I BABIED this cable--stored and used in a straight line (no twists or bends) on an uncluttered desk, did not use the tablet while plugged in, no kids or cats had access to the room where it was in use, etc.  Just a very poorly made cable.  The BlackBerry cable is sturdier, still works like a charm from 4 phones ago, and even survives twisted up in my purse or briefcase without falling to pieces.  While I'm sure both cables are made very cheaply in China, the Dell cable is clearly inferior.\n\nAnother huge issue is the unreliable wireless connectivity.  At times the Venue will be simply unable to find a signal, even when other devices in the same room have no issues.  I end up having to shut down, restart, and run the troubleshooting wizard over and over to get it to reconnect.  When I do get a signal I check to make sure I have all the correct drivers and whatnot, so it does not seem to be related to needing a software update.\n\nThis sad little tablet and a problematic Dell laptop (purchased at the same time, required several service calls related to repeated failure of wireless connectivity--they finally had to replace the entire top/screen half of the laptop where the antenna resides) were the final nails in Dell's coffin for me.  Quality is simply not what it was years ago from this company.  The Venue still only rates two stars, and HP gained a new customer."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I was really looking forward to the DV8P with hopes that it would provide the right balance of a Windows 8 experience. I've tried Windows 8/8.1 on several PC's and felt it was a shoehorned UI for a mouse and keyboard environment. So I was hoping that in a touch environment it would provide a much better experience in how the user interacts with the OS. It's no surprise that Windows 8 is meant to be on a touch device/tablet that is built around the OS.\n\nInteracting with the Start Page and desktop environment has a natural feel and closing apps by swiping down feels just right. So why 3 stars? It essentially boils down to the hardware and limitations thereof. Windows 8 needs to be on a larger screen than an 8\" tablet. Text size is just too SMALL which creates a secondary problem, touch input and accuracy. Closing a window in desktop mode, pulling up a shortcut from the Start Button and getting the correct input is typically 65% correct most of the time. Interacting with IE 11 which is a nice plus has it's share of problems when you want to get your bookmarks. I found the better experience to be using the IE 11 app instead of the browser.\n\nAs far as hardware goes it's pretty good. Fit and finish looks good, the screen is bright and clear, buttons are carefully laid out in a logical manner. As far as battery life goes it's not bad as I get between 8-9 hours although the battery can get uncomfortably warm under load. I had to move my hand out of the way as it got quite warm on several occasions."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I bought this because I thought it would make college a little easier to manage. I already have a good notebook, but I don't need to bring it daily. I wanted something bigger than a phone to browse the web and check assignments, so a tablet seemed like a good idea. For the most part, this fits what I was looking for (but the appeal wore off). I've had it for almost a month (as of this writing), and have used it daily for 1-2+ hours. These are my own experiences.\n\nThere are many reviews about this product on Amazon and all over the internet, so I'll just stick to my impressions instead of rehashing all the details again. The build isn't the best. After two days, I started getting horizontal lines across the screen of ultra-bright pixels (not quite \"dead\" and not quite \"stuck). I tried some of the pixel fixing programs but they didn't help. It appears to be the hardware itself. This was a bummer, as it went from brand-new to slightly distressed almost immediately after buying it. This may be my own fault, but considering it was in a hard case in a laptop sleeve in a laptop bag, it's not a good indication. It almost makes me feel like I need a hard case for the hard case (yo dawg). Also, the screen often registers 2-6 taps when it wants to, making typing on this thing very frustrating at times.\n\nThe power button is a pain. One slight brush and the tablet powers on or off. If something in my bag shifts and the button pretends it's been touched, then the tablet powers on without my knowledge. I've had a few experiences where I went to check something and it had already been on and the battery drained to empty, leaving me unable to use it without plugging it in and waiting the 5+ minutes for it to get to acceptable \"start\" levels. Dell needs to fix this for the future, with something like a \"hold 2-3 seconds to power on\" feature instead of \"blow air towards the tablet and watch it power on and off.\"\n\nIt comes with a full version of Office 2013, which is nice. The problem with this is Office 2013 is on the desktop, made for desktop, and the desktop is a joke. I have to constantly tap the screen many times to get the folders and files to do something properly. Desktop is not meant for touch, of course, so many people will probably not have a good time trying to use it with touch. It's easier to get around using a bluetooth mouse and keyboard. The problem with this is...\n\nIt's not as cheap as the initial price lets you think. You'll need a bluetooth keyboard (and probably mouse if you want to use the desktop properly). Then you'll need a screen protector to protect the main point of the tablet. Then you'll probably want a case to protect the whole tablet. Then you'll probably want a USB On-The-Go adapter because you can't plug regular sized USB cables into the baby slot. Then, if you have trouble with your finger size or touch ability, then you'll probably want a stylus, which are hit or miss. Finally, don't forget the micro SD card to add space for saving and transferring files from other sources. When you add it all up, considering sometimes paying for cheap versions of hardware can also mean cheap quality or DOA, then you'll be spending between $50-100+ to get this tablet in set up enough to protect it and get full use of the features.\n\nAfter all that, I feel like I would have been better off just getting a notebook and external mouse. None of the limitations of the tablet and less headaches. Touch screen is cool and I can see a lot of the perks, but an all-in-one is much nicer than having to carry around accessories and parts to make using it easier. For now it helps me check the stuff I wanted to check and do a few of the things I wanted to do. I just can't take it seriously as a replacement for a notebook (or netbook, which is silly considering that it's about twice as powerful as my old netbook I used for four years). I definitely plan on selling this in the future."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "UPDATE:  8/18/2014.  After about a month or so of using this tablet, I decided Windows 8 wasn't for me, and I bought a Mac computer.  Now, having said that, my daughter, who has a Dell Inspirion 15 laptop with Windows 8.1, loves this version of Windows, especially with a touch-screen inteface.  She is required to have a computer to use at school, and was constantly cramming her Inspirion into her school backpack, along with her textbooks, folders, etc.... My Venue 8 Pro was the perfect solution.  Now, she takes this tablet and a bluetooth keyboard with her to school, which has significantly lighted her load.  She is able to do everything she needs to do at school with the Venue 8 Pro, and saves her work to her Skydrive cloud storage, and when she gets home, she can head over to her Inspirion and pick up where she left off, and has the same user-experience on both devices.  So, it definitely wasn't a waste of money buying this tablet, and I would say for a student, this tablet in many cases would be much more useful and productive than an Android tablet, or even an iPad.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFirst of all, this is a well-made, high quality tablet. Display quality is sharp and colors are vivid.  It has the full Windows 8.1 operating system, not Windows RT, which means you can load regular Windows software just like a regulars Windows 8.1 desktop or laptop computer.  It boots up quickly, apps and programs load very fast.  With an OTG cable, you can connect USB devices such as a thumb drive or wireless mouse.  You can also connect larger peripherals as well such as as an external hard driver or DVD player (though you will probably need a powered USB hub for the large devices such as these, as the tablet's internal power isn't sufficient.).  Microsoft Office Student and Teacher edition is included at no extra cost, making this a great little computer that you can actually do real work with while on the go.\n\nThat's the good.  Now for the bad.  Putting it simply, many of the Windows 8 apps are just plain terrible, lacking in key features.  Take the Kindle app for Windows 8, for example.  I can only download my Kindle books, not Kindle periodicals or magazines.  C'mon, Amazon, you can do better than that.  My whole purpose for having a Kindle app on a tablet is so that I can read magazines in color and look a the pictures i.e. have a more traditional magazine reading experience.  I don't read books on my Kindle app.  I have my dedicated Kindle e-reader for that purpose.  I can download magazines to my Android tablet as well as my Ipod touch.  Other apps, such as the Fox News app for Windows 8, look like they were just thrown together as an afterthought.  When I open a video in Fox News, it causes Internet explorer to boot up side by size, cutting the screen size of the app in half, presenting a disjointed experience.  What's up with that? I find myself ignoring the app all together and just accessing the Fox News web site.  I could go on.  So, my beef is not with the tablet, or Windows 8 per se, but with the writers of the apps for this platform.  Maybe these apps will improve over time, but for now, I won't be putting my old Android tablet up for sale on Ebay anytime soon."}

In this tablet you have a full PC operating system that you can download any application you need.  The screen resolution is pretty good even though it is not full HD.  I have had an Nexus 7 (2013) and Ipads and though those tablets have tons of apps in their respective app stores they are somewhat limited in my opinion.  Sure Windows appstore is still lacking but its getting better every month.

When I got the second one, I found that it had FOUR bright pixels and one dark spot, in addition to many smaller dark spots along the edges of the display. I was planning on dealing with it because I didn't want to deal with the hassle of setting up a new one. That plan went down the drain when I couldn't boot to windows or restore it. If you're looking to get a replacement, make sure amazon has it in stock. I say this because the first time I tried to get the second replaced, my cs rep thought it would be adequate to have me pay for one for $50 more than the original and she'd do me the great favor of waiving the shipping cost. When I told her it would be a problem, she offered me a $20 promo credit. Of course I never got that promo credit, and I cancelled the return and replacement order because $300 extra taken out of my account just doesn't work. I waited until I saw it in stock shipped and sold by amazon, and tried again. This time everything went perfectly and I'm happy to report that the third one is 100% perfect. I would recommend this to anyone who is used to windows 8 and very patient. If you're used to an android tablet, it will take a while to get used to. Give it a couple weeks and you'll be using it in a completely different way than any other tablet. If not, return it and buy a Nexus 7."}

The update procedure should be more understandable than it is.\nMany others have given good reviews, so I won't repeat what others have already said. I would like to address the complaints about the problems people have with the shape of the small USB port. The cord plug has a couple of small bumps on the bottom. Pay attention to that and you won't have a problem. To make it even easier, I place a small decorative sticker on the top of all USB cord plugs so the sticker always designates the top side of the plug. If the sticker is facing up when I plug into the tablet, I know it the correct side."}

One thing you must be careful of however is the micro usb is shaped so you can connect the cable incorrectly and break the tablet so make sure you are always plugging in the micro USB correctly. Another downside is you cant use the micro usb and charge the device at the same time (there are ways to do this but its complicated and involves soldering). Other than that this tablet is great although I think I should have spent the extra $ and got the dell venue 11 pro or a surface. The 8inch screen is pretty good but I think I should have opted for a larger screen. I got miracast to work so when I get home I plug in a keyboard using a micro usb to usb connector and wireless project my tablet screen onto a monitor, with this setup the tablet pretty much turns into a desktop! One other thing to note, with micro usb to usb adapter you can plug in USB devices but those devices must be self-power or use very little power. You can plug in a keyboard or USB stick but if you want to plug in a USB hub the hub must be powered with its own power cord"}

Same story. Slightly different in terms of where the problem seems to reside but the result was the same. Even if taking the prescribed steps had fixed the problem, I would have returned the machine.

I'm running 32-bit Windows 8 on a HP Envy X2 - and upgraded to 8.1 when it was released. Zero problems. I've owned a couple of Dell desktops over the years and they were very good.

I ordered another one of this tablet for a friend and he wanted me to set it up for him, he bought it new. The tablet came new and as soon as I wanted to start to set it up it wouldn't turn on. The reason is because the battery had no charge, if this is your case leave it charging for two hours then come back to set it up. Then since this model is over a year old, there is a lot of updates, you can leave them off but I wouldn't recommend it for security reasons. Again it takes 1-2 hours of constant updating and restarting, and then removing all the unwanted preinstalled apps it's also a waste of time. Overall when you finish installing updates and everything the tablet grants ultimate performance also is great for reading, you can add a bluetooth keyboard and a mouse and have a mini PC so it's a great product but the price is too high keeping in mind is over a year old.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "First, let me say to everyone who has difficulties operating in Desktop mode because of large fingers that everything can be made a lot bigger:\n\nRight click on the Desktop (touch and hold before releasing) and touch on Screen resolution.  Youll have the option to Change the appearance of your display.  At the bottom of that page touch on Make text and other items larger or smaller.  Next, touch on Custom sizing options and select whatever fits you.  I elected 150%.  Notice that the screen resolution won't be affected.\n\nIn Internet Explorer you can zoom by pinching or double tapping.  Double tapping automatically tries to make columns fit the width of the display.\n\nTherefore, I don't really need the stylus for basic operation of the tablet, although its nice to have it.\n\nAfter a long wait, since December, Dell sent me a replacement stylus by Next Day FedEx (at Dells expense), which arrived two days ago.  It works beautifully!\n\nThe active stylus is both a writing or drawing instrument and a mouse substitute.\n\nThe problems with the old stylus were: 1) It clicked from about  above the tablet, which made it impossible to control, and didn't stop writing when lifted, so that it would draw tails after everything.  2) The battery would get exhausted after one or a few days in the stylus.\n\nDell released a firmware update on January 2, 2014, which didn't fix my old stylus but probably helps the new one.\n\nThe new stylus highlights the icon, word, or menu item on which it will land when its about  above it, but doesnt click until you touch.  It only writes when its touching the tablet.  Control and accuracy are nearly perfect.\n\nIt has a switch on the side.  If you press the bottom half of the switch before touching the tablet, a circle will appear on the tablet as the stylus approaches and, when you touch, it will be interpreted as a right click.  So, left click is touch and right click is touch with the bottom of the switch pressed.  In each case you can know in advance where you are going to touch, which helps you guide the stylus.\n\nOn OneNote, Excel and other programs putting more or less pressure on the stylus results in a thicker or thinner line.  You can almost do calligraphy, as if you were writing with a quill!\n\nI measured the voltage of the battery and after over a day in the stylus and frequent use it didn't change by even one millivolt.  Therefore, the fast discharge problem is probably solved.  (In the old stylus the battery would lose about half a volt in a day.)\n\nAs I explained before, as the stylus approaches the tablet, the tablet senses it and items are highlighted.  But it you wait slightly less than a minute, the stylus turns itself off and the tablet won't sense it at a distance any longer.  Thats what allows the battery to be saved.  And clearly it wasn't working in the old stylus.\n\nTo turn the stylus on again, you just need to touch the tablet with it.\n\nAfter using the tablet for over a month and the new stylus for about two days, Im extremely happy with it.  For basic tasks its as powerful as many laptops, but small and light.  At this price point, for anyone that wants a hand held full Windows 8.1 PC, this is an obvious choice.\n\nI would also suggest that some of the problems encountered by other reviewers might be caused by lack of familiarity with Windows 8, Windows in general, or by not having downloaded the firmware and drivers from Dells website and updated them."}

That's a huge step forward for data collection in the field.  No more Windows Mobile!  No more Android apps that are hopelessly inadequate for serious purposes!\n\nBut Windows loses out to Android in a huge way when it comes to tablet interface.  The biggest problems: A) Inability to resize images on the screen by pinching.  Some Windows apps support this, but most Windows programs don't.  And with no active stylus with which to manipulate the very tiny controls on the screen (although we're told there's a useable stylus in the works, no mention of when it will be available), using this thing can be very frustrating.  B) The keyboard does not deploy automatically when you place the cursor in a text entry field- what a pain in the arse it is to have to call up the keyboard manually every time you want to type.  C) No built-in swype function for the keyboard text entry.  That's a serious time saver, especially for fat-fingered people like me, and it should be built in to all touch screen devices, IMHO.\n\nMy suggestion?  Unless you have to have a windows machine to do non-frivolous stuff, you should wait until companies get this windows tablet thing right before purchasing one.  When Microsoft fixes issues like those described above, these things will be AWESOME.  But until then....\n\nP.S.- And if you have to have one now, MAKE SURE you get one that has a functional active stylus.\n\nUpdate 2/1/14\n\nNow sending this tablet back to Dell via Amazon.  It began to show signs of instability after about 2 weeks of use; the same signs that others have reported in reviews on Amazon.  It goes to sleep with a weirdly glowing screen and can't be reawakened or turned off with the power button until some random event (anyone's guess what the event is) occurs 15 minutes later and the thing pops back to life.  I regret the 3-star review now; should be lower.\n\nUpdate 3/23/14\n\nNow has an active stylus that works well enough, so many of the useability issues reported above that related to small icons and fat fingers have been mitigated.  However, the issue reported in the previous update persists, and that should make you nervous if you're thinking about buying one of these.  Also, Windows 8.1 sucks just as badly on this tablet as it does on my laptop.  It developed an unsolicited Bluetooth problem as have SO MANY other Windows 8.1 systems.  I was able to fix by resetting to a previous state, but again, even though things are often fixable with some shenanigans, it should be enough to make a prospective buyer nervous.  I haven't been able to fix my laptop's Bluetooth problem in 6 months.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I purchased this tablet to use for vacations that include air travel. I always back up my SD cards while on a trip and a Windows computer is the only practical way to transfer 10 or 20 GB of photos to a hard drive each night. This tablet is about 5 lbs. lighter than my laptop and power brick combo. Although the instructions say the USB port doesnt provide power, it actually will power a thumb drive, SD card reader, small USB hub, or in my case a combo USB hub/SD card reader with a built in micro USB connector. This combination allows me to plug in a small powered hard drive and the SD card at the same time and copy files from one to the other. You cant power the tablet at the same time so be sure its charged up!\n\nThis was my first experience with Windows 8.1 and I can see why its such a shock to Windows 7 users who are trying to make the transition. At first I configured it to look like a Windows 7ish computer, but you still end up dealing with the Windows 8.1 interface. After a while I found that the best way to deal with it is to keep it in the native Windows 8.1 interface mode and use the Windows 7ish desktop when you need to do real work or move files around. Theres no training provided on how to use Windows 8.1 to check out some tutorials in the internet, youll lower your stress level.\n\nThere are some things you have to do to make it usable for more than web surfing: 1) Buy the 64GB version, 32GB is too small, 2) Buy a 32 or 64GB micro SD card and put your documents, music, videos and photos on it rather than on the tablets main memory, 3) Buy a Bluetooth mouse, 4) Configure the Windows 7ish desktop to be 125% (right click on the desktop and pick Scree Resolution/Make text and other items larger or smaller. Pick Let me choose one scaling level for all my displays and pick 125%, 5) If you are going to do anything more than write a few emails youll need a Bluetooth keyboard.\n\nNormally for a new PC I create one Admin account to use for installing software and managing the PC and a separate user accounts for me and anyone else using the PC. The way Microsoft handles the Windows Store signup may change the way you configure the tablet. When you initially set up your Windows Store account, it changes the login and password of the user on the tablet to be the same as the Windows Store account. So my Admin account got changed to my email address. I haven't found a way to undo that, so you may want to create your Microsoft Windows account from your user account. Also, installing an app from the Windows Store only installs it for that user, not all users on the PC. There are some simple ways to deal with that you can find by searching the internet.\n\nOffice 2013 is included, but the instructions don't tell you how to activate it. Open up one of the Office applications and when it asks for a license key, enter the license key from the Windows 8.1 restoration disk. Although the tablet is called Venue 8 Pro, its loaded with standard Windows 8.1. Windows 8.1 Pro is a $99 upgrade you can do through the Add features to Windows 8.1 control panel menu.\n\nThere is a bug in the OS that causes the screen to go blank sometimes after logging in.  There is a Windows update that fixes it but its not selected by default in Windows Update. After youve done the Important Windows updates, select all of the Recommended updates and install them, too. Also, KB2911106 in the Optional section is a good one to install."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "Get the new Asus instead. In terms of performance, this is a great tablet.  It is quick with internet content and can handle streaming HD video.  The battery life is good.  It is pretty light and is a nice compromise between the too large to take everywhere tablets and the too small to see everything tablets.  If you just want something for browsing, games, reading books, and want Windows, it works well for that.  However, Windows programs are not designed for fingers.  Things like Outlook have too many scroll bars next to moveable folders.  Buttons to close/maximize/minimize windows are too small and close together.  The computer can't figure out if I am trying to move the screen around or select things.  One needs a stylus for such fine work.  If one doesn't need Windows, I'd suggest going with Android for a lower price point and better tablet-optimized programs.  My primary reason for choosing this tablet over a cheaper Android tablet with equal performance was that I wanted a Windows tablet to use for note-taking with One Note and an active stylus.  However Dell has not had the active stylus in stock for 2 months now and I get vague promises of when it will be available and I will be contacted when it is.  They had similar problems with not having the keyboard cover available either when they first released this machine.  I should have just waited for the Asus VivoTab Note 8."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "With the ever growing invasion of technology into the classroom, I was in the market to buy a tablet. Many of my professors are using Powerpoint, pdfs, and word docs so when I found out that some tablets came preinstalled with Microsoft Office, it narrowed my search pretty quickly. I also bought all my textbooks as ebooks rather than the hard copies so my backpack has been considerably lighter. Apple and Android have a much larger selection of apps and games, but if you're just trying to get work done, that doesn't matter. It takes a few days to get use to the choreography of swipes that bring up menus, but it's set pretty logically. You can split the screen to be able to look at two different programs at once which is useful in homework. Great picture on Netflix. Camera, picture, and video quality are clear. After a month of using this tablet, I switched my smartphone data plan from 2.5GB to 500MB because I had been way under my limit, so now I'm saving $10 a month. Overall, I don't have any complaints about it. Perhaps the text displayed is a little on the small side. Those with older eyes might have trouble on the 8 and might want to look at the 11. However zooming in and enlarging text isn't much of a problem. Haven't dropped it yet. Very comfortable to hold. Battery  last all day just viewing files and programs and couple of youtube videos. The more video you watch obviously depletes your battery more."}

I love the idea of being able to run my full blown Win 8.1 applications. Edited 7Feb2014- I have had this tablet a month now and after the first week and a half it started dropping the WiFi and Bluetooth connections.  I have had to do a refresh causing to reload downloaded programs  which can be a problem if they are single license programs. After the refresh things got worse....I have spent hours on the Dell Support line and now I have to send the tablet back for depot repair meaning they put me out of commission using my tablet for 10 days with no guarantee that it will be repaired.  As far as cost goes the tablet, a BT keyboard and BT Mouse and a micro SD Card will run you about $475.00.  The tablet keyboard is too sensitive to use a stylus....doubles characters thus making it hard to type in passwords.  I am now very disappointed in the tablet.  The support techs are in India or Pakistan for all I know which also makes it difficult to understand what they are saying.  They are quick to want to take control of the tablet to fix a problem but I suggest if you have any understanding of the processes that you should have them talk you through the steps....you'll need to for you'll end up doing them several times.  I had a tech tell me that the tablet will build up a static charge that will interfere with operations."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "In short what I like about it most is that the screen is big enough to actually get work done on (compared to a phone), but it's smaller, thinner, and lighter than an 11\" tablet.  Yes, I can put a Surface in a backpack, but this is much easier to take around the house or with me on errands.  I ended up buying a case with a bluetooth keyboard so when I want to do serious work (e.g. long email for my job) I can be more productive..\n\nAnd that's where it really shines for me.  Yes, I can read books, play media, and browse the internet, but what I'm loving is that I can get my corporate email on it and work on Office docs seamlessly while on the road, something I can't do with my wife's iPad.\n\nSkydrive mounts as just another folder in explorer, so dragging & dropping files back and forth from the cloud to the device is seamless and natural.  I use this a lot because not everywhere has good wi-fi, or wi-fit at all.  Or even cell reception (so tethering doesn't get me anything).\n\nThere are more and more apps for the Win platform now so aside from a game or two I haven't found anything I need that hasn't been available for the platform.\n\nMy wife has been an iPad addict since the v1, and I'm seeing her use my Venue more and more as the weeks go on, for the same reasons I cited above (productivity).\n\nJust like the Nokia 920 with Win8 was the first WinPhone that was worth moving away from the iPhone for, this is the first 8\" Win tablet that I think is worth the money, esp. as it really is more than an entertainment device, which is all most tablets are good for.\n\nMy next task is hooking it up to a full 23\" monitor and keyboard/mouse (just need to order and adapter), and then I can get rid of my laptop too."}

(PS Microsoft again, you know how many time I accidentally hit the search button on your phone?) Thanks for not printing your logo any where on the front of the screen."}

I can combine my Nook reader and Kindle reader as well as Calibre into one portable device as well as use it for my emails, document viewing and manipulation while on the go.  My only complaint is that the advertisement makes it sound as though MS Office Home and School is \"included\".  It's a trial version for which you still must pay full price if you want to continue using it beyond the trial period.  Fortunately, Open Office is free and takes relatively little real estate on my limited (128gb) storage.  Most of my time was taken in customizing screens for optimal viewing since Windows thinks you're viewing on a full sized screen and presents you with what, on this screen, are tiny fonts and icons.  All that aside, I love it and would recommend it!"}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "While I like the Venue 8 Pro in general, I cannot bring myself to give it more than a 3 star rating at this time. Here's why:\n\nThe Good: Fast and responsive for most tasks. The Venue 8 Pro works fine with quite a few full fledged PC games providing they support the Intel video chipset, though to be honest the unit becomes quite hot during play. Office Home and Student comes pre-installed (32gb version).\n\nThe Bad: Not ready for use out of the box. The Venue 8 pro had numerous problems including seriously wonky screen brightness auto-adustment issues, requires manual reset of WiFi when turning on or coming out of sleep, touch screen responsiveness issues and some other minor, less serious bugs. Driver updates as well as a BIOS update had to be done manually as the included Dell Update software was quite literally useless. The Dell support website was one step short of nightmare with autodetection and assistance tools that either froze or were otherwise dysfunctional. In addition to this, expect no more than 10-12gb space left over after you install anti-virus and a few apps. A microSD card is a must. A USB hub is also a must if you plan to use anything but bluetooth enabled peripherals.\n\nUPDATE 2/12/14: WiFi issues persist despite full updates."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I purchased this item from Dell directly and was happy a few days before realized they were not so good as others claimed here.\n\nFirst, there is a serious wifi connection problem. I took this item between home and work place and set up connections for both. For Iphone or iPad, they will automatically recognize a wifi and connect by itself when switch from one place to the other. However this is not the case for Dell Venue. 8/10 times this device will tell you NO NETWORK AVAILABLE when a preset wifi IS available. What can you do? The Dell Technician told me to HOLD THE POWER BUTTON until the power goes off and then restart. Does that work? Yes, but  do you mind?\n\nSecond, the \"bluetooth\" simply not function at all. I have a bluetooth next to Dell Venue and a Iphone, Iphone detected it immediately and asked for password to connect, while DELL VENUE Kept SEARCHING FOR DEVICES and never it was able to find a device right next to it. I planned to use my bluetooth earphone for this device, but had to gave up. Is this a big deal to me? not so big because I learn to my iphone mostly.\n\nThird, the device won't let you watch/listen to Youtube without interruption. Once the device enters SCREEN PROTECTION session, it stops playing Youtube or any other music from you device. You have to swipe the screen to let it WAKE UP. Is it annoying? Yes, very much.\n\nFourth. The power. I let the device plugged on charger overnight and the next morning I plugged it out , saw the screen black, placed in my suitcase. Did not use it in the day. In the evening, when I needed to use it, it showed the power dropped to 25%, where did the power go? The device was hot when I took it out my suitcase. Apparently the device had been running  by itself for nothing.\n\nThere are a lot more headaches with this device, but I will not list everything here. I hope the above would help you make a decision when you are looking for a Windows Tablet\n\nGood Luck!"}

The browser is faster than my Android browsers.\nThe hardware+OS core functionality is almost 5 stars.\n\nBut Windows 8.1 interface is a mess. Examples:\n1. Applications work differently:\n- some are 100% compatible with 8.1 and touchscreen,\n- some are compatible to different degrees, for example, Kindle Win 8.1 works split screen (50-50), but it takes only 1/3 of those 50% of the screen. Google Chrome mostly works but there are modes, tweaks, small issues...\n- of course many applications are 0% compatible.\n- even apps delivered with the system (Notepad, Paint etc) are not 100% Win8.1/touchscreen friendly. Why is the product shipped with applications that are not compatible with it?!\n\n2. Settings are spread between so many, many places... There is the right side pop-up (?charm?) window, old Control Panel, Administration Tools etc.\n\n3. I had to return my first Dell Venue because of defective touchscreen. I wanted to remove all personal data at the store from the device. I couldn't find a way to do it. Why? This seems like a basic functionality (returns, giving device to someone else). The only option I found was to rebuild the system with a warning that it may take several hours.\n\nIt is refreshing to take an Android device after the Win 8.1 experience, and see how everything is logical and consistent in Android across the whole system."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "This is a nice tool, but I'm finding that there are some limitations that are annoying.  I haven't had any of the problems with power or other technical issues that other people are complaining about.  There isn't anything that I'd call a deal breaker because I'm sure there are ways to work through all of it, but if this was my only computing system, I'd be a bit frustrated. A lot of what I've been doing is hit and miss and I'm not sure where to find instructions for some of the things I might want or need to do.  I've been trying to add more accessories and what Dell offers is quite limited. There's only the one micro USB port available and it is very limited.  Dell does not offer any cables or other devices to extend the capability from this port--you have to find them from other vendors, but the problem with that is not everything is going to be compatible, especially if you want or need to charge the tablet while using the port.  Dell only offer the stylus, a bluetooth keyboard (which was not available when I first got my tablet so I ordered a cheap one that works just fine), and you can get additional power adapters.  That's it.  And sadly, the power adapters are exactly like the originals in that the cords are quite limited.  If I'm going to get an additional power adapter, I'd like it to have a longer power cord.  Right now, I have just enough length to reach from the power strip on the floor to the top of my dresser or desk and comfortably lay the tablet sideways at the edge.  If I'm careful, it doesn't fall off while charging.  It would be nice if the power cord was twice as long or at least half again as long.  I've tried buying other vendors' power cords, but have yet to find any that are compatible--I've purchased five and I've taken the tablet to Radio Shack and had them try all the same type and weight they had and nothing worked.  Clearly, Dell has done something to prioritize this function.  I'd be more than happy to buy any of these cables, peripherals, adapters from Dell if they fit the need, but they don't offer them.  I want an adapter for the car just like everyone else has--how hard is that to make available?  As for functionality, the tablet works pretty good.  Although I have to say, while I wanted the Windows OS, I realized right away that even though I use Windows, I'm not so much a Microsoft user.  The Venue 8 Pro immediately tried to force me to do everything using a Microsoft account, which I didn't have and didn't want, but I figured all that out and we're getting along okay now.  (-:  One of the things that was a disappointment was how it was touted that Windows Office, including Word, Excel, etc was included on these tablets.  This IS NOT TRUE.  You get the Windows 8.1 operating system, but you only get a TRIAL version of the Office suite, which you have to initiate and it is only good for a limited time.  After that, you have to pay full price for it--they don't even offer a decent discount for it if you decide to buy it.  That is not spelled out anywhere--at least I saw nothing until I logged into it.  I'm surprised none of the reviewers mentioned it..  Pretty cheesy if you ask me and it probably would have changed my mind about whether I got the Windows tablet or just went with an Android tablet, which probably wouldn't have had all the power cable issues.  If I realized I was going to have to pay another $130 just so I could use Word and Excel, it wouldn't have had the appeal.  I thought I needed those for transfer from my laptop.  Without those,  I can do just about everything else I needed to do on any other OS."}

I don't recommend it for any children or individuals that need a more simplistic tablet experience. Running angry birds on an i*ad feels normal. This rig chews through excel spreadsheets and feels right at home with everyday work related items. No need to download any special \"apps\" or pay extra for apps that allow you to open all the business related documents you work with daily. Its preloaded with Office 2013 Home & Student. Most App's are just watered down versions of the real thing. It just runs real programs for real projects. Sure if you need the occasional \"popular\" app, they are out there.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "Finally decided to review this product.  I use this tablet for work and play. Here are just some of the things I have done so far:\n\n1. Connected to an external (Plugable) brand docking station for full Ethernet, printer/scanner and dual monitor support\n2. Installed our company VPN client on the device to remote into the office network.  Combined with the dock, it is essentially like being on a full desktop.\n3. Used Miracast to wirelessly view several movies and play music to our TV when we have company.\n4. Used Miracast with OneNote and the stylus to do some interactive learning with my Sunday school class.\n5. Just for fun, installed Starcraft 2 on a mounted SD card. Plays well enough, especially with the onscreen mouse(see my below suggestion)\n6. Also installed Virtualbox to use with Android Virtual Machines. I always get a kick from running my Nexus 7 VM in full screen mode and have people thinking it is an android tablet, then swipe out to go back to the start menu.  The VMs run smoothly as well and depending on your build you can access to the front and rear cameras and other sensors.\n\nNot enough good things to say about Windows 8 in an 8\" tablet form. It is a very liberating experience to have this kind of power to take anywhere I need to go.  I love that my wife and I can have our own personal profiles with our own apps and layout, as well as have separate accounts for work on here. We even setup a guest account with limited access we let the kids use to play game apps and surf the web. Family safety allows us to very finely tune what they are able to do and also lets us easily monitor their usage history, another plus.\n\nFull access to Windows desktop also means I can install anything I want, like VLC Player or MP Classic codecs.  Nice.\n\nFor those people complaining about the difficulty selecting icons on the Win8 desktop due to the high resolution and small icons, search for and install the touchmousepointer program. I use it in full screen mode, with the left and right-click overlaid to the far-left.  It turns my entire desktop into a trackpad and I can move the cursor across the screen with ease. Best of all is if I connect the tablet to my dock or use Miracast to extend the screen, the pointer will follow me onto the other screen, so I can still use the tablet with multiple monitors without needing a physical mouse. Wish Microsoft had built this into 8.1(bump) so we would not have to rely on third parties, but again, just being able to install this is a strength of full Windows.\n\nI also like that I am able to create a full image of the hard drive, using familiar Windows tools. I try to make a backup at least once every couple weeks to keep handy on my Micro SD card so if anything I install breaks my functionality, I can just reset to my image instead of going all the way back to the preinstalled factory settings and reinstalling everything.  If you only use the tablet for apps, this is not a big deal as those settings are backed up with your Microsoft account, but if you have a lot of desktop programs installed (Office, Adobe, QuickBooks, etc.) a current image is helpful to not have to reinstall these.  You also have system restore, another tried and tested Windows tool that works well on here.\n\nI have also experienced the stylus sensitivity problems others have mentioned around the web. For people still having problems, install the latest Synaptics firmware update posted on Dell support from January 2nd. It has brought my experience about on par with what I have come to expect from a Wacom and I am very glad I purchased it.  It is a great optional piece that made this device stand out among the other 8\" Windows offerings this past Fall.\n\nI have also experienced problems where WiFi will disconnect after extended use and the tablet must be power cycled in order to restore it. I have been in contact with the Dell representative for our office and they are actively investigating it.  Device loses one star for me because this hasn't been fixed yet, but the benefits of the device far outweigh this, IMO.\n\nThe support on this device has been a plus for me.  We've purchased several brand Windows tablets for testing at work. All have experienced horrible after purchase support for hardware and software issues, but Dell has so far been responsive, communicative and very eager to try and make the device work well. They have a lot riding on these devices right now and that has shown in a definite advantage to the consumer. You get a quality built product and responsive support.\n\nAll this being said, I can see where this device is not for everyone.  If you are just wanting something to carry around to watch movies or read eBooks, get something simpler and less expensive. Also, there are some people who just prefer to keep their two worlds - laptop and tablet - separate. This device is not for you. But if you want a good device to consume content and can also be a low powered laptop, consider this.\n\nIf they are able to resolve the wireless issues, I will probably come back and give this 5 stars. Good Job!"}

My primary tablet has been an iPad 2 since it's release, but I've never really been a fan of 10-inch tablets. iOS's basic \"apps-on-a-screen\" user experience has also just become an eye sore.\n\nPros: The full power of a PC, in an 8-inch tablet, at an under $300 price point. This alone deserves 5 stars!\n\nCons: 32gb equates to less than 10gb of free space, but that's more of a fault of Windows. Having to use the microSD slot for permanent storage.\n\nMy first orders screen cracked under my thumb in the first week of use due to some kind of manufacturing flaw. I put in for a replacement and it arrived within a day! Transferring data was easy enough, seeing as how everything was pretty much already on an SD card.\n\nThe limited number of apps in the Windows Store is a bit of a disappointment and the one feature I miss from iOS has been notification center, but thats also not really a unique fault of this product.\n\nConclusions:\nI've seen many reviewers of this product insist there to be a physical windows key on the front, but I'd prefer even entirely doing away with the physical key and I don't know why they brought the desktop start button back on tablets. We don't need three of them! It's a simple swipe-and-tap away to use it from the charm bar!\n\nI have yet to have a immediate need for an active stylus, USB peripherals aren't a priority, and neither has a wired connection to an external display.\n\nI also haven't experienced any of the wifi connectivity problems mentioned here, so I'm guessing updates have more or less resolved that issue.\n\nIf it weren't for having to have it replaced so soon after purchase, I'd be rating this 5 stars. The sheer capabilities of this device, at this price point, far outweighs anything else!\n\nThree months later:\n\nThis little beast has become my goto device for half the things my laptop used to do and it's completely replaced the need for an iPad in the house. (That thing's become desk decoration... all it does now is notify me that I have mail.)\n\nFirst, I still have no demanding need for USB peripherals, but a Micro USB to USB adapter can be incredibly useful.\n\nSecond, I did eventually run into that wifi issue everyone seems to get. I think it happened to me twice. The first time I had to reinstall a few updates and the second time I just restarted the device. Haven't had wifi issues in 2 months.\n\nThird, the low memory (only 2gb of ram) has really started to show itself on occasion. While it's not a surprise and it certainly doesn't effect my overall opinion of the product, it is something to be aware of.\n\nLastly, I've discovered a handful of general issues I've had with Windows 8 itself: The metro Internet Explorer app won't play audio in the background, while the desktop app will, but only the Music app seems to continue playing with the device in sleep mode... IE, iTunes, and Spotify will not... Also, you can't drag-and-drop files between Apps. What's it been, three years and Windows 8 still has these oddities? Sorry, I digress...\n\nNo complaint of mine has beat the $250 price, it's still been every bit as satisfying a purchase as I'd hoped it'd be."}

But here is the thing  If I don't like an app for something like social networking or YouTube, I have a real web browser actually I have my choice of many real browsers (not mobile browsers). I know that a lot of Windows users have been unhappy with Metro and after using it for a few hours, I can see why. It is radically different from what we have come to know as Windows. For the purposes of this review, I won't get into that in how it pertains to desktop use. I will say though that  especially now that Im used to  I really see its value on a tablet or touch screen device even if I am still on no hurry to \"upgrade\" my desktop from Win 7 to Win 8. There are some choices that Microsoft has made that are less than ideal but they all have easy workarounds (and you don't have to practically be a programmer to do them), which makes Windows 8.1 stand above Android and iOS.\n\nThe next good point is the size.  I think that the 8 inch form factor is perfect. Its big enough to be fully useful and small enough to manage thumb text entry pretty well. And the auto-complete in Windows and Windows Phone start out superior to Android and iOS and because of how well they learn, it simply leaves the others in its dust.\n\nHow about the fact that it shipped with a full version of MS Office installed FREE. This devices comes out of the box a productivity monster.\n\nOn to the display quality  I will put this up against an iPad any day.  I have watched a couple of hours worth of Netflix streaming video on this thing and there is no eye strain.  I honestly wish that my HDTV looked this good.  However, the automatic backlight adjustments is not great so I turned it off.  Its worth noting that my daughter was not impressed with that on her iPad and turned it off as well, so it seems to me that perhaps this technology is just not quite ready for prime time.\n\nPrice  Are you kidding me? Best bang for the buck of anything in its class.  And I honestly don't know how anybody could hold this up to the Surface and not walk away with the Venue instead. The Surface was what I wanted but I couldn't afford the Surface Pro and wanted a device running the FULL Windows OS, not RT.  This caused me to look at other devices and when I got to this one, I was so glad that the money issue drove me here.  Way better device, in the end.\n\nFinally we have a real USB PORT and micro SD card expansion, making this a real computer and very flexible.\n\nOh but wait! BATTERY LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I turn it on first thing in the morning and turn it off when I go to bed. I wouldnt call my average daily use heavy but I would call it well above average and I never use more than 70% of the battery, even on my heaviest days.\n\nNow for the bad parts \nThe touch screen is clunky.  Its not bad but its no iPad. In fact its no Nokia 822, Widows Phone (the smart phone that I use).  Put a screen protector on and it gets clunkier still.  But Im adapting quickly to its eccentricities. I just wish that its pinch to zoom was better. Again, my smart phones have done that much better.\n\nAnother thing related to the display is the way that some apps and programs, like IE and Firefox use auto-complete. They put the suggested words so high up on the screen that even with my very large hands, I have to let go and reposition my grip, to touch select the appropriate word, rendering it just short of worthless in those programs.\n\nI also think I would have put a slightly higher resolution cam in it.  The camera on my smart phone has nearly twice the resolution.  But then, I never thought that tablets were a good idea for day to day camera use and I have had this thing for two weeks and have yet to see a need to take a picture or video for anything other than test purposes.\n\nThat being said, in the end, I love this thing. It has quirks and downsides but every device does, and for me, the upsides way outweigh the downsides. Is it the best choice for everybody?  I will have to say no.  Its an acceptable entertainment device but the Kindle Fire HD, the Samsung Galaxy or the iPad would probably be better, because they are simpler to use. But as a working productivity device, its miles ahead of the competition and its still a very good entertainment device to boot.  Add to that the battery life, free MS Office and the price, and I cant imagine a better option for me or users like me."}

I am mostly pleased I chose the Venue 8 Pro and would do so again (but I admit I've never tried the Lenovo).\n\nThe good:\n\nThe device does, indeed, feel solid and of high quality. The back has a really good grip. It was very easy to use and set up out of the box. Performance is great--it is snappy, even while streaming video and using other apps.\n\nThe bad:\n\nI've had a lot of issues with the screen not registering touch. With or without the screen protector, I find that I am having to re-tap a number of times for it to register. This gets very annoying. I hope an update might address this soon. Also, using the Desktop Environment can be very challenging. Windows 8 just doesn't seem to be designed for such a small screen and high resolution. It's challenging to tap such small buttons or icons--even with a stylus--and it slows down productivity.\n\nI would still recommend this as a great portable full-service windows device."}

I have owned 2 iPads, the second version and then upgraded to the Retina display version, both with the ability to use cell as a data source. Never used that feature on either, mind you.\n\nAnyway, once you have had a tablet that works smooth with NO issues, you don't want to expereince another tablet with the most basic functions, the navigation of the screen, webpages, login user/password entries with ANY issues.\nWhen off the bat this thing would make multiple entries of touch input. After a couple weeks DELL posted firmware updates, but it never fixed it 100%. I have to say it was 90% there. Then if you try and calibrate the screen touch accuracy, and happen to do it in Landscape mode, you will brick the unit(unless you get a miniUSB to USB adapter to get a mousse plugged in.\nLastly the stylus was a great feature that has yet to be fixed. The stylus falls apart, innaccurate, and simply useless. They did some updates and things have gotten slightly better, but they also have hardware issues.\n\nAll this time DELL sweeps the issues under the rug as much as possible without coming out and making any comments that may help assure people who purchased the device.  I had a replacement unit, and the same issues.\nAnother issue with Dell is that when you download an update, you can't see if you already installed it, even when you give up your computer to DELL to analyze and scan the system. Their tools for at least this device is broken, and all while never was fixed.\nThey did try and send replacement unit out, and becareful as you might get a refurb as I did.\nDue to past DELL purchases not going so smooth, I think I am done, unless a super deal on a desktop from the Outlet.\n\nSo I recommend getting an Asus or other tablets that use a Wacom touch stylus technology.\nI also had to reset the unit several times for drivers to take. Too much a hassle. In essence there are new drivers and while they are problematic we report back with problems for the drivers to be tailored towards.\n\nThis was obviously released before testing.\n\nWhats there to love?\nFit and finish feel is really nice.\nFull Win8.1 OS with Office\nThe idea that it will have a active stylus one day, when they fix it.\nBattery life\nMicroSD, miniUSB, Screen is good viewing quality.\n\nProblems:\nWifi even after update, can be spotty.\nScreen orientation is much better with update, but I still have hangups when switching from one user to another user profile.\nStylus is not usable for certain tasks\nTouch screen and navigating is painful with touch sensitivity changing. The updates have helped a lot, but still not 100% solid.\nWithout the stylus the OS is worthless as you cannot be accurate to point where you want on a 8\" screen.\nI spent hours on support calls to get resolution."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I've owned the Dell Venue Pro 8 since early December. I am not going to rehash what others have already written. Instead I am going to focus on 2 things: l) the full windows experience and 2) the stylus.\n\nThe atom processor used in this device is excellent for metro apps. It is, however, a little sluggish for applications in full desktop windows like my publisher.com.  Word, Excel, Powerpoint and the like. Hand on heart, even if you are a die-hard windows fan, the only two reasons to buy a Windows tablet are one, to be different, or two, because you like the idea of full windows functionality-things like flash, office suite, etc. Otherwise you would be better off with an Ipad or with some kind of inexpensive android device.\n\nSo getting back to the full windows experience, desktop apps don't work well as touch apps. You need a mouse, touch pad or some other pointer device to effectively use them. One day all of these applications may be written for touch, but they aren't today. That's why, hands down, the Venue Pro is the only 8\" Windows tablet worth considering. Neither the Toshiba non the Lenovo Miix2 offer a solution that is effective and cost efficient, which is a decent stylus (preferably a capacitive one).\nThat gets me to the stylus. When the Dell first came out, the divers were horribly tuned, and it was very difficult to use. The first driver update was very helpful, in that you could easily use the Stylus as a mouse, but it still was only a mediocre input device for text and drawing, You had to write really slowly for it to work well. The latest driver I downloaded this morning is incredible and I world say the stylus/pen now rivals more expensive ones found on the surface pro.\n\nYou have to buy the 64 gb version- windows remains a memory hog, and you should also buy the Dell Active Stylus.\nBy way of comparison, I also own a Kindle Fire, lpad 3, Original Surface RT,IPhone 4S,HTC 8x windows phone, a Lenovo Yoga computer and a ThinkPadX1 carbon and have worked extensively on Mac Airs."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I've found this to be a slick and responsive unit. Battery life is a little over 8 hours and the screen appears quite brilliant. There is a cabal of specification snobs that  insist resolution of 1280 x 800 will not do. They should be ignored, and possibly flogged. The device boots in about 2 seconds and navigating and customizing the W8.1 OS is simple and intuitive. It connects just fine to my WiFi set-up and moves through applications and web pages with smoothness and speed. I've read professional reviews that take away points for an oddly placed Windows button and an ill-advised factory brightness setting. For what it's worth, I feel the Windows button is perfectly placed (and I never use it, the swipe function is always easier and more efficient to use) and the brightness issue is fixed with a firmware update, as are a few other issues. To be honest, any reviewer who mentions these items as a \"con\" can't be taken very seriously. I can't see where else you would place the button without it getting in the way and the brightness\" problem\" is kid stuff.\n\nThe camera is pretty good which is better than I expected (and need). Stylus problems seem prevalent per other users ( I don't have one), though a brand new (2-Jan) firmware update supposedly helps immensely. Also, judging from the fact the stylus is no longer listed on Dell's accessory page, there will be some hardware tweeks coming. Still, this is poor form from Dell as the stylus was obviously released before it was ready.\n\nThe rubbery, hard-molded back has a real premium feel and the tablet seems quite robust, not some cut rate piece of plastic. The design is simple and minimalistic.\n\nAs you might expect, MS Office (included) is a bit cramped on a device this size. If anyone is surprised by this they shouldn't be. This tablet won't replace a laptop but there is no reason you can't log on to the home office to sharpen up some work or create a few simple docs in a pinch.\n\nStorage is only about 8 gigs after the office install, but that's why they invented the cloud and mini SD drives. They also invented a 64gb version.\n\nTo me this device rates a 4.5, but Amazon doesn't allow half stars as this would probably lower overall scores and higher scores sell better. That being said, to me this tablet is very reasonable at $300 and a bargain at $250, especially considering the inclusion of MS Office."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "Dell Venue 8 Pro\nThe Dell Venue 8 Pro produced a reaction in me that a tech device hasn't done for a very, very long time: love at first touch. I stopped by the Seattle Microsoft Store recently and spotted the Venue 8 Pro while browsing through the tablet area. Ive read a lot about 8 inch tablets in the last year but had not thought about getting one after the original Kindle Fire I purchased stopped working a month after its warranty ended. And I frankly thought Amazons version of the Android OS was not very good.\n\nThe bright IPS screen of the Venue 8 Pro caught my eye, but picking up the device was a delight. I loved the textured feel of the back which provides a feeling of security that the device won't slip from your hand. And it also just plain looks good as well. Dell reduced the bezel of the tablet, at least on the two short sides, which visually increases the feeling of thinness. I checked out the edges to see the ports and buttons provided and everything I needed was there: SD card slot, mini USB, headphone. I noted there was a camera both on both the front and back, although in my case these would only be used if absolutely necessary as my Lumia 1020 is my real daily use camera.\n\nThe Microsoft Store clerk came by about this time and asked how much I liked the device. I said it was great and a delight. I had grabbed a couple of the other 8 inch tablets they had on display but put them down again after a moment. The combination of the great screen and the quality feel of the Venue 8 Pro kept me wanting to check it out. The clerk reminded me the device ran full Windows 8.1 and came with Office Home & Student. I knew that. He pointed out that the Windows button that is usually placed on the bezel of touch devices was instead on the top right side (when held in portrait mode). This takes a bit of getting used to but prevents accidental presses of the Windows button on a device that will most likely be used in portrait mode. Then he told me the Venue 8 Pro was selling for $279 for the 32GB version. I was hooked and purchased the tablet on the spot.\n\nIn my experience since purchasing the Venue 8 Pro, it will run between 7 and 10 hours depending on use. There is a digitizing pen option available if you want to take notes on the device. I haven't used that. There is also a 64GB version that costs about $350. The Venue 8 Pro is a great pocket-sized device that runs full Windows. I haven't for a moment regretted my spur of the moment purchase.\n\nCould the Venue 8 Pro be improved? The only thing I would suggest would be inclusion of an adapter to connect the mini USB port to a full sized USB port."}

After waiting until the end of January for parts to become available, Dell stepped up and offered a refurbished unit as a replacement. I was greatly relieved. My view of Dell was quickly falling and we always had such great support out of them at work. My faith in them has been restored.\n\nTo further update my review, I bought a stylus and was able to click a little finer than my fat fingers would allow. I was able to change the size of things on the screen. I have found that a setting of 150% looks good right now. I still wish that I could adjust the size of the virtual keyboard, or its transparency. It is hard to fill out forms when you can't see what you are typing sometimes. The stylus I bought is rubber tipped and skips across the surface, so writing isn't possible with it. Perhaps I can find one with a fine plastic tip like on my Samsung Note. My previous review follows.\n\nFirst, I like the size and grip of the tablet. The price was really attractive. The handwriting recognition was awesome. Even with fast scribbling, it recognized almost everything I wrote. The window needs to be smaller though. It took up 2/3 of the screen so it was hard to see what was being entered.\n\nThis tablet is only 8 inches. Windows apps look good but programs are tiny. I had to have my glasses on to read any text and try to select anything was frustrating. I tried changing the size in the software, but for some reason the slider wasn't enabled and wouldn't work. I bought a stylus and selecting was greatly improved. If I had to do it over again, I would get a 10 inch tablet since I am mostly using programs versus apps.\n\nMost importantly, I was removing my seat belt with the car door open and had the tablet in my coat pocket. Only about 1/3 was sticking out. The seat belt pushed the tablet out and the magnetic catch didn't hold resulting in the tablet landing screen first on the pavement. Needless to say, I was sick to my stomach. I couldn't find a repair number on the website or the included literature and called technical support. After many transfers, I ended up at \"out of warranty\" repairs and was told that there aren't any parts for this device until the end of the month (January). Totally sucks. I have to wait until the end of the month just to find out how much it will cost before even making a decision about repairing it."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I bought a DVP8 right before Thanksgiving. Like many others, my initial take on this PC was extremely positive. I also own a Surface RT, an Asus Transformer Book, and a Nexus 7 tablet, but I found myself soon most often reaching for the DVP8.\n\nThe Surface RT is classy, but the lack of really good apps still holds it back. It winds up being a web browsers for me. I also find it heavy to hold for long periods of time. I really hate that it has a proprietary power plug. Anywhere you go, you have to bring along ITS own charger. Unlike nearly every other modern consumer device (barring Apple) that uses MicroUSB.\n\nThe Asus Transformer is, well, like a cheap netbook with a touch screen. It does the workman job for me but its strictly that, a work device. Its too heavy for general consumption use  but its laptop keyboard makes it very, practical. As a tablet, its not so great. The screen sucks, and the battery life is poor.\n\nThe Nexus 7 is nice. I like it a lot. The full suite of Android apps makes it appealing. Great battery life, light weight, but its basically a big phone that cant make phone calls. I cant do real work with it. But its a good Netflix platform and gaming device for the kids.\n\nWhat I like about the DVP8: The battery life is good, the screen is absolutely great and the form factor just works for me. As a full Windows PC, it can do it all and found that it really does what Microsoft envisioned for Windows 8  a 2 in 1 PC for both work and play.\n\nSo why the one star rating? Because within a month of purchasing my DVP8, one day I discovered that I could not plug in the power cordit simply would not connect. No amount of forcing, could make it charge. I took it to my nearby MS Store (thankfully, I live near one), and they deemed that the MicroUSB port had been damaged and gladly exchanged it for me.\n\nSo I got my new DVP8 home right before Christmas. Within two days, the exact same thing, the MicroUSB port was damaged and I could not charge it. I took it back to the MS store and they thankfully took it back for a full refund.\n\nAfter doing some research on the subject, I found a thread in Dells support forums which discusses this issue and where I found others with the same problem. It seems to stem from Dells choice of using a MicroUSB A type socket (which is a rectangular shaped port), instead of the now universally common type B socket which is trapezoidal shaped. Every micro USB cord I own, is designed to fit into a trapezoidal shaped socket. In fact, Dell evens supplies the DVP8 with a trapezoidal shaped power cord! With every other modern micro USB device out there today, the trapezoidal shaped power cord can only fit into the trapezoidal shaped socket in one direction. But with the DVP8s rectangular shaped port, its possible to plug it in the wrong way, and thus damaging the port.\n\nNow I know that many people reading this would blame me for plugging in the cord the wrong way. But consider this. Over the years, Ive had dozens of devices that use a MicroUSB charger. My last 5 cell phones, my head sets, my other tablets, etcmost of which a plug in EVERY DAY to charge. In years of use, in plugging in various devices over thousands of times, I have never, ever, broken a USB port before. But I was able to break two DVP8s in a little over a month. If you cant charge your tablet, its toast.\n\nThat my friends is a serious design flaw. As one other person in the Dell forum pointed out, its simply a matter of time before every DVP8 owner may plug in the USB power cord the wrong way one time and render the device totally useless. Thankfully, my problem popped up soon after buying it and thankfully the Microsoft store was willing to work with me on it.\n\nIf Dell were to fix this, I would buy another in a heartbeat. But as it stands, Im going to get either a Toshiba, a Lenovo, or wait for the new Asus 8 inch tablet."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I will separate my comments on the product from my comments on Dell.\n\nI ordered with overnight delivery in hopes of using the tablet on a trip. Amazon successfully delivered overnight, the tablet successfully booted up, and I spent about 10 minutes running through the set up. I tried visiting a web page after setting up and was prompted to apply Windows updates. I clicked on OK and within a second the screen went crazy and the tablet started emitting a high pitched whining noise. I had to shutdown using the power button. When I tried to power back on, the tablet would not start up. Other than a very dim backlighting on the screen, the screen was completely black.\n\nI spent a long time on the phone with Dell customer support. This was a 1.5 months ago, so I might be misremembering, but I believe I was on the phone for about an hour. They wanted me to try different outlets in my house, sticking paper clips in holes on the side of the tablet, ... It was obvious to me from the start that this was a waste of time. The tablet was obviously dead. Eventually the support technician accepted defeat and said I would need to return the tablet. He said it would take 5-10 business days to ship a new one.\n\nSince I had originally ordered from Amazon with overnight shipping, I told him that I would return the tablet through Amazon in the hopes Amazon would ship a new one overnight. When I tried returning through Amazon I found the product was now out of stock and the estimated ship date was a month or two later. I called Amazon to cancel my return through Amazon and called Dell back. Amazon said to make sure to let them know if Dell tried to charge me for shipping the old back and that Amazon would cover any such charges. This was not an issue because Dell covered all of the shipping. Interestingly, a day or two later I got e-mail from Amazon updating the ship date for my replacement. I had to call Amazon back a second time to get the replacement cancelled.\n\nDell did manage to ship a new tablet in (if I remember right) 5 business days. I have to give them credit for this. This one worked. Dell said there would be a shipping label in the box for me to return the defective tablet. There was no label. I e-mailed Dell support and told them I needed a shipping label. They did not respond. I called Dell support and explained the situation. They told me to just use the shipping label in the box?? I explained to them again that there was not a shipping label in the box, and they e-mailed me a shipping label.\n\nSomething to note about Dell's phone support is that the lines are noisy. My hearing is not very good and I had a lot of trouble understanding a lot of the people I talked to. Most of the calls I made involved being transferred to at least one if not two other people. I'm guessing technical support is overseas. The returns department seems to be in Cleveland and phone conversations with them were much easier for me to understand.\n\nI took the package to a UPS drop site to return it. I asked the people there if I could get a receipt because Dell had demonstrated so much incompetence that I figured they would lose the returned tablet. I kept checking UPS until a saw the package was successfully delivered. That was a relief!\n\nNow more than a month later I just received a call from Dell saying that I needed to return the defective unit. I called them up. I will admit that I was a little rude when I talked to them. I mentioned my comment to the UPS drop off site about Dell incompetence and ended my explanation of the problem with something like \"it is not my problem if you lost it.\" In response, the support person said something like \"Thanks. Have a good one.\" That was pretty much our entire conversation. Now I'm left wondering if Dell has accepted that I've returned the defective tablet or whether I'm going to get more calls about this in the future.\n\nI called Dell back and asked to talk to a supervisor. After spending about a half hour on the phone, Dell seemed more concerned about getting a tracking number for the returned product than all of the inconvenience I've been through.\n\nFortunately I still had my receipt from the UPS drop site and it had the tracking number. UPS still is showing the package as delivered. I called Dell back and provided the information. They acknowledged that it had been delivered to them and said they would update my order to show the tablet was returned. Still no apology for accusing me of not returning it or wasting a half hour (in addition to the 2-3 hours I've spent in the past e-mailing and talking on the phone) of my time on the phone to take care of the problem.\n\nI went to the Dell site to post a review. It turns out that the guidelines for reviews on the Dell site specifically prohibit comments on customer support. All you can comment on is the actual product. That is somewhat telling.\n\nIf it was not for the horrible customer support, I probably would have rated this product at least 3 stars. I am a software developer and previously had an iPad. While I really like my iPad, I have been frustrated that I cannot install software development tools on it. Since this Dell runs Windows, I figured I could install whatever I wanted on it.\n\nI have been pretty impressed with the various programs I have been able to install. I have not found anything yet that I want to run that I cannot. The problem is that a lot of the things I want to run were developed for use on Windows using a mouse. I find that I cannot select things on the screen finely enough with my finger. Thus, while the programs run, the user experience is poor when using a finger on a touch screen. This is a Windows 8 issue rather than a Dell issue, but it is still something to keep in mind when thinking about purchasing this tablet.\n\nI've also had a couple of times when the device is a little flaky when \"waking up\" (for example, when hitting the on button after the tablet has been sleeping for a day or two). At one point, I was worried that this tablet had died like the first one, but fortunately it started working again.\n\nI am still hopeful that I will get a lot of good use and enjoyment from this tablet. Even if I do, though, I'm sure if I ever think about getting another Dell it would have to be pretty special to outweigh my dread of Dell customer support."}

Is it a surface pro 2 powerhouse? No, but it's close and forget what you know about atom processors because baytrail is a new dawn for ultra small pcs the day of netbooks is history. Ive tried several games and with realistic settings it will do while on the road, your not going to play BF4 on it but older games should do fine like halo, ut2004,half life 2 etc era games will play fine. This thing only has 2gb of ram so becareful multitasking with more than say a couple of programs opened at the same time. Ive tried turbo cad and photoshop and it works fine, which is why I traded off my ipad mini due to its limitations.\n\n I really like the build quality for this price point, I have the 64gb version and also purchased a 64gb class 10 micro sdxc card for movies-music files. I say don't even bother with the 32gb version due to updates etc, it just isn't enough space IMO and dell doesnt charge an arm and a leg for more storage like the fruit tablet company does so go 64gb version. I really don't care about the cameras but they take a good enough picture if you had to use them.\n\n One main selling point for me was the ability to use an active stylus with this tablet, only problem is I have not been able to locate one yet. IDK if dell is sold out or redesigning it?!? Ive had the surface pro 2 and there are times the stylus comes in handy and I realize the one for the dell isn't exactly the same but still from what Ive seen it is still better than a standard stylus ive seen people using on ipads etc.\n\nBattery life during normal usage( everything other than gaming) seems to be around 7 hrs or so though gaming may not last that long. The back of the tablet will get hot while you are gaming , kinda wished they had used aluminum for the back so as to act like a heat sink to help cool it off. Normal usage the back only gets a little warm, and I do like the texture and feel of the device even though it shows finger prints but will wipe clean.\n\n I may add to this review after a month or so of usage, Ive had the device a couple of days and so far it will do what I need it to. Overall happy happy happy.\n\nUPDATE: Ive noticed someone else mention the micro usb port charging issue, I researched this thoroughly before I purchased this tablet and I will say if you are careful plugging the charger in and making note of what direction you plug it in at you shouldnt have any issues. I do agree maybe dell needs to make this area reflect the actual tapered design shape of the plug instead of having a rectangle cutout. I also recommend using the dell charger instead of a phone charger which will work also but may take longer to charge the tablet."}

But I already broke one of the pins in the Micro USB power connector. Funny thing is the socket in the tablet is a rectangular Micro-A and the power cable plug is Micro-B (un-even shape which makes you plug in the right way if the socket is also Micro B). One can easily put the Micro-B plug in the Micro-A socket in the wrong way and if you force it, it will break the pins inside. Just like I did! I don't know who in the world made this choice! I have been using Android phones which correctly use a Micro-B socket and Micro-B plug!\n\nI would have given 4.5 starts for this tablet but for this serious design flaw I have given 2 starts."}

Now its my wife's, and she let me buy the 64GB for myself.\n\nLike most people who buy Windows Tablet's I am not a Surface fan, which almost put me off buying any Windows tablet. But, Dell has done a good job with this one. Windows 8.1 (not RT), very light, good battery life and just the right size, solid construction. Best of all, it comes with Office. Which honestly, was a major Achilles-Heel of Window's Tablets in the $400 or higher range. I won't pay for $400 in hardware to have to pay $100's more for Office. I am a huge user of Onenote and Office, so there would be no point in me buying a Tablet without Office on it.\n\nInitially the App store was abysmal, but I happy to say that many of the things I use on my desktop and now available on Windows 8.x and these 8.x tablets (Dropbox, Box, FB, Twitter, Hulu, Netflix, eBay metro app, Amazon app, etc...)\n\nStill, its a little on the pricey side, (ie. Dell's Android Venue is $150 by comparison), but I am not a GoogleApps enthusiast so for fun and productivity, the Win 8.x based tablet fits closer to my needs.\n\nLastly, one thing I should mention.. I take no end of heat for having bought it. I work in a Gapps based enterprise where iPad's rein supreme. So I am the black sheep; which is fine because I get my kicks when some people descend into sputtering convulsive fits when I dare to whip it out in meetings. :) (Who would have guessed owning a Windows device could make one a rebel....)"}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I bought Venue 8 Pro 64GB from Dell directly, so this is a review for the product in general, and has nothing to do with Amazon. Anyway I feel I am obliged to report what I have experienced and let you decide if this product is worth your time.\n\nIn a nutshell: after TWO replacements in a month, I had finally decided that THREE defective units in a row are just too much. I spent 3 hours with 7 people this morning with Dell and finally got a full refund.\n\nNow, back to the story. I will say something about the active stylus as well.\n\n----------------\n\nThe new tablet looked really promising when I first got it. Light, small enough to be used as a tablet yet fast enough to be used as a desktop, provided an external monitor solution is present - which is sadly not the case.\n\nI applied updates, then I got an error during the updates. The unit still boots after that, but refuse to do system reset or refresh any more. I called Dell and they told me that one of the updates breaks the reset/refresh function of Windows 8.1, and the only solution is a replacement, which I did.\n\nThe second unit is received after a week. This one has another problem: when the battery hit 30% or lower, the unit cannot properly wake up on battery after standby, resulting a cold reboot of the system. It always wake up properly while on AC. Dell tried many things to solve it, but eventually determined that it's a battery defect. So I gladly did another replacement.\n\nThe third unit came after another week. This one seemed fine, except for a dead pixel on the left long edge. I could live with that. After about a week or so, it started to experience the same issue as unit#2 - cannot wake up on a moderately low battery level.\n\nI called up Dell on Day 32 after the initial purchase. After spending 3 hours requesting a refund, all they can offer is yet another replacement. Reason? I passed the refund window (30 Days)! This is totally unbelievable as Dell has yet to fulfill the initial contract of shipping me a working unit!\n\n----------------\n\nMuch said. You can draw your own conclusion, but I believe the Venue 8 Pro\n\n1) has some serious design flaws\n2) has abysmal quality control\n\nand after wasting countless hours getting pushed around to totally unrelated departments in Dell, I would add another\n\n3) utterly irresponsible customer support\n\nAs for the stylus: if you are lucky to get a working one without the \"endless hovering click\" problem, it's still largely useless for writing, as it always leaves a tail of every stroke even after the tip is lifted from the surface.\n\nThere is not reliable way to do external display. Miracast is just too slow. There is no HDMI or DisplayPort. You can use DisplayLink's USB solutions, but then their driver kills Connected Standby (draining battery overnight). Finally, you need to find a way to charge the tablet while using the USB data (using a hacked USB hub - soldering needed).\n\nMy conclusion: there is no peace of mind at all when you use this tablet. Venue 8 Pro completely fails as a serious business product. Stay away unless you need an expensive toy to hack."}

My venue would not turn on after I turned if off to install the armorshield. A replacement is on its way. I currently own a Kindle Fire HDX and an Ipad II. I really wanted another tablet to take with me when I deploy but could not justify spending 800$ on another IPAD.\nThe venue has many plusses and minuses. I will start with the CONS.\n1. It's a lot more cumbersome to navigate through the venue. Maybe it is just me being accustomed to the IPAD. It will take some getting use to. It's not difficult just not as intuitive as the ipad.\n2. Downloading apps, movies, is slower than I am use to. Not terribly bad but enough to notice.\n3. The case that amazon bundled with it won't stand it up on it's own.\n\nPRO's:\n1. It's significantly less expensive than an Ipad.\n2. The ability to double its memory with an SD micro card is a game changer. For me when I am on the ship I can preload video, games and music onto a card and swap them out. I can also use the adapter to attach to an external hard drive which is extremely nice.\n3. Its a windows computer essentially. I downloaded Itunes onto it and still retain access to all of my video's and music.\n\nI will update more when the new one comes in and I get to play with it some more."}

This was my first tablet and I wanted to be able to integrate it with my Windows laptop and use it with Office, Excel, etc. When I first opened it, the tablet appeared to function fine, and I was able to walk it through the set up and input all of my data. However, after the initial set up, the touch screen began to get more and more erratic. Each touch would create multiple entry's.  It reached the point where it would take 5 tries just to unlock the home screen. I had an IT expert (30 years in hardware & software) follow all the online help to try and solve the touch screen issue. The 'fix' lasted about 2 hours and then the multiple entries started to recur and actually worsen. Unfortunately this led to the screen freezing up on a browser. This was not the first time the screen had frozen and I was not willing to deal with it anymore. At this point I ended up deciding to return the tablet. I actually loved the Windows 8.1 system and the tablet itself and might have kept it if not for the touch screen issue making it totally unusable."}

This device perfectly fit that bill.  I can run full Windows programs and apps from the Windows store.  I would like to touch on some of the negatives I have read about this tablet.  First, as others have said, there is no video out port.  This can be overcome with an OTG cable and USB Displaylink display adapter.  Also, I wasn't able to try Miracast yet, but I was able to mirror the desktop using a Chromecast.  Second, I haven't found a way to charge the tablet while using the OTG cable.  This hasn't been an issue for me because the battery lasts me more than an entire day. Third, some people complain about a lack of apps available in the Windows store.  Being able to run the full desktop version of programs means I don't need most of what is missing.  Finally, out of the advertised 32GB of storage, I had around 13GB free out of the box.  This tablet does have a microSD card slot (unlike many of the other top tablets available now) and works great with the 64GB card I installed.  Overall, I highly recommend this tablet to anybody looking for a great portable machine that doesn't have the limitations that other tablet operating systems.

I have found these capacitive buttons a pain especially when watching Netflix, or Hulu because you will be holding the tablet on the sides, which this tablet has plenty of on both ends (very comfortable) without any worry of accidentally hitting the home button (or back button) and ruining the movie. Tablets I own: Ipad, Galaxy Note 8, Nexus 7(2013), and Dell Venue Pro8. I have never used the tablets for GPS so I am not so concerned as my cars have navigation, and so do my iphones and Windows phones. Oh!, and the tablet is a joy. It runs the full windows faster than my  4 yr old Dell Studio laptop with Intel Core2duo. But I still use it as a normal tablet and not a full PC. I would have gotten the Surface RT, but it is bigger, and more expensive. Made no sense to me. Dell makes a lot of sense."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "My prior experience with Atom processor-based devices has been extremely disappointing.  I had read that the Atom in the Venue 8 Pro was much better than previous versions, but we've heard that about every new version of the Atom.  So I was a bit skeptical that this tablet would even be usable, let alone responsive.\n\nSo when I booted it and found it was actually quite fast I was very pleasantly surprised.  Much snappier than I would have ever expected.  And that hasn't been limited just to Windows 8-style apps, but to most of the apps I've run on the desktop as well.  It just doesn't feel significantly slower than my desktop or laptop PCs.  Performance-wise, It is completely usable.  If the potential lack of speed is your hesitation for not buying, you need not be concerned.  It is fast enough for anything but 3D games and the most computationally intensive software.\n\nIn terms of other aspects of the device, it is light and thin enough to carry around with you, but not nearly as thin and light as the iPad Mini or Nexus 7.  Not that it is too thick or heavy, but it isn't nearly as svelte as these other tablets.  But you're getting a lot more -- you're getting a tablet that actually runs a full version of Windows, and includes the real Microsoft Office.\n\nThe screen is very good (do install Dell's software update to address the screen brightness issue), and having ClearType font rendering in Windows means you don't have to run a retina-class screen for text to be crisp at smaller font sizes.  The screen isn't as high a resolution as the iPad Mini with Retina Display or the Nexus 7, but the difference isn't significant enough for this to be an issue for most people.\n\nThe biggest complaints I have with it are (1) it only has one USB port, and it requires a USB OTG adapter which isn't included if you want to plug anything in, (2) the stylus (not included) is only mediocre at best, and (3) Microsoft still doesn't treat the desktop seriously on touch-screen devices.  By that I mean that it really hasn't been thoroughly thought through.  For example, if you're on the desktop and bring up the on-screen keyboard, it covers the lower half of the screen (landscape mode) without any scrolling of the desktop, blocking what might be on screen on the lower half, with no easy way to move things around.  This makes it very difficult to enter data into applications on the desktop without a Bluetooth or USB keyboard.  It would be an easy thing for Microsoft to address if they really wanted to, but it's pretty clear that the desktop isn't a priority to them at this point.  As such, I would not buy this tablet assuming that desktop apps are actually usable without a physical keyboard of some kind.  And Dell can hardly be blamed for Microsoft's shortcomings.\n\nFrom a hardware point of view, though, the Venue 8 Pro is really a very good tablet.  If you're considering it, just buy it.  It's cheap enough (and good enough) to be a product that anyone shopping in this market ought to own."}

Adding a Bluetooth keyboard is next; also go ahead and buy a couple big microSD cards.  I have multiple cards, to hold movies and music, and others to hold large photo files.  Why buy another laptop?  This is full Windows 8.1 by the way, included in the purchase price.  This thing rocks and will keep me busy for some time.  I prefer the 8 inch tablet size since I travel (via airplanes) very often, and is so much better for video viewing and for typing with chubby fingers than my iphone!

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "The Dell Venue Pro 8 is a brilliant device except for one serious flaw: Dell supplied the wrong charging cable on the Dell Venue Pro 8. The port is rectangular and the plug is trapezoidal so it can be plugged in either way, and if you plug it in wrong, you can bend or break the pin block.  I went to my local Staples store where they have rows and rows of tablets. I looked at the connectors on all of them and every single one used a connector that could not possibly be connected wrong. (Except of course the iPad mini which uses a reversible Lightening connector which is designed to go either way). The Dell Venue Pro 8 is the only device I can find where it is possible to connect the power cable wrong and therefore destroy the device. People are suggesting that you mark the device with a pen somehow, but that's just a band-aid measure. It's inevitable that you or someone will eventually connect it backwards and destroy the device. Put simply, the device is doomed. And to those that suggest you shouldn't force it, I don't agree. The pins are tiny and it would be very difficult for an average (perhaps slightly ham-fisted) person to physically detect if the connector is going in upside down. The plastic post inside the connector is just a tiny plastic wafer and would be extremely easy to bend. In other words, you wouldn't know if you have it backwards until it was too late. You'd better have perfect eyesight and be very careful, or have a magnifying glass handy, because otherwise, sooner or later you are GOING to destroy it. That is inevitable. This is a serious design flaw and Dell needs to recall them all and replace the connector. There's no way in this day and age of computing that it should be possible to plug in a connector upside down like this and then destroy the device. It's only a matter of time before every one of these Dell Venue Pro 8 units is damaged because of this issue. Dell screwed up the design and customers are paying for the mistake.  Beware."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "The Venue 8 Pro is a wonderful device for the price point.  Occasionally the screen recognizes the stylus has touched it by making a circle highlight but it doesn't recognize that it was directly on top of a button so the button should have been selected.  The 64gb is the way to go if you are going to get a Venue 8 Pro.  I had a 32 and returned it because after I installed word, excel, etc. there were only 12gb left. I really like the fact that this is a full version of windows pro.  I can remote log into my office to trouble shoot problems or browse the web, run netflix, or listen to Pandora on the relatively descent speaker.  i can't speak for the active stylus or the keyboard as I don't have them."}

This happened after about a month of regular use, just plugging in the charger every day.\n\nThe problem is the port accepts either USB style but ships with the style that can be plugged in the wrong way very easily, thus bending the pins and essentially turning it into a paperweight since it cannot be charged.\n\nThis problem is quite common in the Dell community forums for Venue 8 Pro.\n\nI'll also add, Windows 8 crashes almost daily on this device (yes, it is fully updated). Bluetooth is flaky too.\n\nThe battery also takes more than a few hours to fully charge.\n\nI was excited about the portability, and the ability to do real work if I need to.

I also wanted something smaller than the Surface (too oblong), so the 7-9\" form factor seems ideal. I thought this Dell Venue 8 Pro would finally be the perfect device to meet these needs, and my wonderful wife got me this for Christmas.\n\nOverall I am very, very happy. I love it and use it all the time. Battery life is great, full Windows so you can install anything, screen is nice, and it's available with plenty of space.\n\nI only write this review though to say the pen is terrible. I read it was bad but some feedback was mixed, so I went for it. The stylus though is really unusable. I'm not sure how Dell can sell it as it just doesn't work well. So if you want this tablet for all the other reasons besides the active stylus, go for it! It's very nice. If you want it because of the stylus, don't do it. Wait for the ASUS with WACOM support, or wait for the rumored Surface Mini. Or get this until then, because it's quite nice besides the stylus issue.\n\nUPDATE:\nI saw the newer stylus seemed to fix the previous issues (reviews on Dell's site went from 1-star to 5, etc.). I was going to buy another stylus and give it a try, along with the Dell keyboard. Without prompting from me, Dell proactively sent a newer stylus. Along with the software updates, it works great and really makes this a great little device. Highly recommended!"}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "The name of the product is \"Dell Venue 8 Pro\". This would lead one to think that the device supports/offers Windows Professional 8.1. It does not, and instead includes Windows Home edition.\n\nAnd believe me, I tried to install 8.1 Pro for 2 days. And I failed, basically because this is a poor product, a pretender if you will. For the record, my company is a Microsoft partner and I have access to the necessary software to 'upgrade' to the Pro version. However, Dell has chosen to make that virtually impossible in myriad ways.\n\nStay away!\n\nUpdate 1/3/2014\n\nI considered carefully whether to post this update. On reflection, given the knuckle-dragging responses to my original review, I decided to do so - mostly out of spite. And a special \"thank you\" to the person who told me that I am \"an idiot\" - it means the world to me coming from a moron.\nThe Dell Venue 8 Pro I purchased, and am now returning, was intended for a single purpose: to provide a small form factor test unit for use in my lab. I currently have test devices including iOS, OS-X, Android, Windows Phone 8, Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 8.1. My lab runs somewhere between 12 and 25 virtual servers, depending on client requirements.\nAs I indicated in my original post, I presumed that the Venue Pro was configured with Windows Professional 8.1. Alack and alas, this presumption was incorrect. Unfortunately, this turned out to be a major problem. Please see the following for a hopefully balanced analysis of the Dell tablet:\nPros:\n* great battery life\n* excellent display resolution and readability\nCons:\n* capacitive touch is average at best - for example, it often takes two or even three attempts to launch an application\n*  accelerometers are slow to respond to changes in orientation\n* there is only one USB port, that also supplies power\n* Microsoft's inability to present a consistent user experience across the \"modern UI\" and the vintage desktop\nAs indicated in my original review, my company is a Microsoft partner, and consequently has access to most operating systems and applications for internal use and testing. Hence, I was less concerned about whatever software was on the device, as I assumed I could replace or upgrade same.\nUpgrade log:\n* The unit, as delivered, had Windows 8.1, Home Edition, installed. This version cannot be joined to a domain, which has major ramifications for my test purposes, as many applications depend on trust relationships and PKI. In addition, it requires the user to have a Microsoft account, something I object to strongly given recent government intrusion on personal privacy. In other words, it is not possible to activate the device without having a Microsoft account.\n* First, I attempted to simply enter a Windows Professional 8.1 product key. The Dell refused to accept that key. Reasoning that perhaps this upgrade path is not supported, I created a bootable USB drive with the necessary Dell drivers and Windows Professional ISO as the basis. The XML unattend file contained a valid product key, yet the Windows installer claimed it was unable to read the key. I tried several iterations of the XML file, each containing valid keys, and was unsuccessful.\n* I reconfigured the BIOS on the device to ensure that it was unlocked, and hopefully removed all previously installed encryption keys that might impede a successful installation.\n* I added a USB hub, so I did not have to depend on Dell driver updates, and instead connect a mouse and keyboard to assist in the installation.\n* Over the course of two days, I experimented with various combinations of operating systems, attached hardware, and boot options. None proved successful.\nMy current assessment of the situation is that the worst expectations for UEFI expressed by the Linux community are coming to pass. In some undetermined manner, Dell is able to frustrate any attempt to upgrade a device that I paid for with software that I'm licensed to use.\nAll that said, if you're a consumer who does not care about privacy, has no interest in advanced features of Windows, and wants a device with good battery life combined with a high-resolution display, the Dell is probably a good choice. Just not for me."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "Speaking only of the hardware itself, this device is great. It's good looking, light in the hand, and runs great in almost all situations save for a few graphically intensive games.  I find that the screen gets built up fairly quickly with fingerprint smears but this isn't an issue unique to the Venue. The resolution of the screen is similar to a pre-retina iPad but is hardly noticeable and looks extremely good in most circumstances. The issues with auto brightness have been resolved with a software update. The button lay out is fine, the Start button's location is out of the way so it isn't accidentally pushed when holding the device at either angle.  The battery life is decent, 6-10 hours depending on usage. Windows runs extremely well with zero lag and quick loads. Not being able to charge the device while other accessories are plugged in is somewhat annoying but not ultimately very damning.\n\nWindows 8 might be the only hitch for some people that struggle with a user interface more complex than what is found on Apple devices. Microsoft has come a long way in closing the gap, Windows 8.1 is very intuitive, but tasks like updating the device are slightly more involved than they would be on an iPad. Windows makes the device very adaptable but it comes at a price for less experienced users. Being able to download iTunes and run virtually any windows software available is impressive and makes up for the relatively weak offering of apps in the Windows Store. With practice the UI becomes second nature and the multitude of gestures available start to make navigating the device a breeze.\n\nOverall, very satisfied, especially for the price.\n\n****Update after 4+ months of use:****\nI'm still giving this tablet 4 stars because I'm still very satisfied with it.  I would like to note one ongoing problem I am having with it that I cannot for the life of me resolve.  The wireless adapter goes out at seemingly random times requiring me to either restart the device or go into my device manager to disable then enable it.  I've scoured the interwebs for a fix to no avail.  Suggested solutions like updating your wireless adapter drivers, your Dell drivers, and uninstalling and reinstalling Windows Updates in a particular order have not worked.  The problem doesn't happen frequently, infrequently enough that the problem doesn't sour me to the device overall, but it is annoying when you are surfing the internet then poof, no internet.  This might be a problem that is easy to resolve and I'm just too much a technological dork to make it work but it is what it is."}

I'm still coming to grips with the fact that I can run real honest-to-goodness PC games like Portal, Civ 5 and Starcraft II on this thing! Honestly this is the only Windows 8 Device that makes any sense to me, as it allows you to take advantage of everything the platform has to offer.\n\nOf course it's not perfect, and I do have some very minor complaints. Firstly you will want to install all of Dell's updates, but their update software is very confusing and I could not get it to autoupdate, so I ended up having to download and install everything manually. Also the light sensor is in such a position that if I hold the device a certain way, it frequently dims as my right hand hovers over the screen.\n\nThese are very minor complaints though, I'm really scraping the bottom of the barrel.

The only complaint that I think we both would have is that the USB port on this tablet is the mini port, and he likes to use his cell phone as a hotspot and plug it into the wireless item/laptop/computer etc that he is using instead of doing it as a portable wifi hot spot but he can't because his phone and the tablet have the same size USB receiver so he can't connect them together. We are currently looking for some sort of adapter to be able to connect the two together."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "[EDIT: after using this tablet for a few more weeks. I just find out more and more annoying issues. I am really tempted to give this tablet one star.\nFirst issue, the issue that I mention below regarding 'the screen goes black after login' return again. Second issue, the wifi has to be turn on and off everytime I restart the device or else it won't work. Third issue, just now, the device turn off by itself (actually I'm not sure if it goes to sleep or turn off, but the screen goes black.) I press power button, nothing happen. I wait a while, press power button, still nothing happen. I hold the power button for a few seconds, press the windows button, press all the buttons on the device, still nothing happen. The device is fully charged, so I know it's not low battery issue. I plug in the charger, wait a while and press the power button and hold it for like almost 20 seconds, and finally, the device turn on again. I'm not sure what is the problem. Now I started to regret in buying this device.]\n\nThis is overall a good tablet. It meets much of my expectation.\n\nFirst I'll talk about the good stuffs. The screen looks good, just remember to turn off auto brightness. The device is not heavy. It's considered fast for an atom processor, I don't have any problem browsing the web with several tabs open, and I can browse pages with flash. Haven't tested the tablet with many games. So far, it runs well with League of Legends, Terraria, Gemini Rue and Portal, although I'm not running it at the highest setting. I saw someone was able to play Starcraft 2 on it on youtube. I would say the tablet would be able to play plenty of PC games if not set at the highest setting. However, I wouldn't recommend to buy this tablet just for gaming (see the issues below). The battery lasts about 6 hours while browsing the web. Pretty decent I would say, and it takes about 4.5 hours to fully charge it.\n\nNow let's talk about the issues. On the first week when I received it, every time I turn on the device, the screen will goes black after I typed in my login password. I need to wait a few seconds, then press the on/off button again in order to enter windows. I still had that problem after I updated all the firmware. This is not a big issue for me, more like an annoyance, though now I don't have that problem anymore, not sure what went wrong (or what went right).\n\nThe sound from the tablet is OK, but it is located at the bottom of the tablet. So if you are viewing video, the sound seems like coming from one side of the tablet only. Again, this is annoying, but you can always use an earphone.\n\nIf you are plugging a device into the micro-usb, you won't be able to charge the tablet. Seems like there's a solution for this by using a Y-cable usb otg cable, though I haven't tested it out, and I think Dell should at least provided a usb otg cable which they don't.\n\nNow for the issue that almost cause me to give 3 star. The device gets pretty hot when you are running heavy programs or games. That alone is not the problem. The problem is, after it gets hot to a certain extent, the whole tablet will shut down. This happens to me while I was playing Terraria in a room temperature environment. I'm not sure if this issue only apply to me or to all of the Dell venue 8 pro tablet."}

The tablet is fairly fast in loading.  The wireless connection is very good, at least in my house.  I have a concern with not having another usb port but a small micro usb OTG cable allows me to leave my keyboard carrying case (from my old Android tablet) connected to my Venue 8 pro so that I don't have to use the  virtual keyboard of the Dell. As I don't have a need to charge and work at the same time it doesn't worry me. I didn't purchase a stylus, and I am not sure that I will, given the problems currently faced by owners, so I cannot comment on it.  I find the font size is very small but I have been able to adjust the DPI for a better text size.  I am not concerned with the lack of apps, they will come with time but I am not one for playing games or such.  I don't use them on my computer and I don't need them on my tablet.  Nor am I concerned with not having a HDMI out.  I have a smart TV. It serves its purpose.\nI find the battery life very adequate for my purposes and much, much better than my previous Android tablet.  Windows Explorer works well with pinch and zoom etc and is very fluid.  Unfortunately, and it's not Dell's problem, neither Chrome nor Firefox work anywhere near as effectively.\nOn the whole I am happy with my Venue 8 Pro."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I have been using this device for the past month now and I have not seen ANY problems with it! It handles windows 8.1 perfectly! installed Malwarebites anti-virus and adobe acrobate 9 PRO and its pretty snappy. Sound quality is really loud. Its just about as loud as my ipad 4 retina! Touch is smooth although sometimes a little too sensitive but it all depends on how people touch their screens. I've seen old people try touch screens as if they were trying to squash a bug! Then there are those people who really don't know where the tip of their fingers REALLY end. And I mean REALLY end, you guys should really try putting your face an inch away from the touch screen and look at which part of your finger touches the screen first! its ridiculous but its SO TRUE!\n\nAs for wifi, no problems at all. the complainers got a defected device or maybe they don't know how to take care of their electronics. FUN FACT: did you know that 80% of ignorant people who use laptops like to put their bare laptops on a bed or carpet for hours while they use the laptop? yea I know its crazy how people don't think about the fan sucking in everything it can and spitting it out the vents. The only problem is that these lints and dust particles end up trapped and stuck into the motherboard and processor and they wonder why their computer starts to overheat and lasts for only 1-2 years before they have to get a new one.\n\nok enough of that. Lets see what I've played on this thing... Left 4 dead 2 medium resolution SMOOTH, Heroes of Newerth low resolution SMOOTH!, team fortress 2 high resolution definitely PLAYABLE (no crazy frame lags at ALLL! I've been playing TFortress2 for years btw. I don't play LoL but since HON is the same if not more graphic intense you don't have an excuse there. I tried DOTA2 (without) problems but its not that great. StarCraft2 is good but I recommend low res because the battles get pretty narly. The Dell venue pro 8 with absolute lowest resolution you can play as smoothly as my Asus Republic of Gamers sx74 with a 2GBDDR5 dedicated graphics card on the absolute highest settings.\n\nBattery life IS long! Its just as long as my ipad 4 retina a good 8-9 hours or standby for literally days like the ipad too. you guys who have problems with that are doing something wrong.\n\nHmmm... what else...oh this is one of the most stupidest complaints. the tablet not charging. ok ok if its defective then its defective and i'm sorry. get an exchange from dell. but you guys do know that the AUTHENTIC DELL CHARGING BRICK IS NOT A NORMAL IPHONE/ANDROID BRICK RIGHT? the brick supplies a higher voltage/amp than that low voltage you got connected to your phone. dell probably doesn't want the lower powered brick to work anyways out of fear that it might short fuse the circuits if you use inferior products. SO PLEASE STOP USING YOUR PHONE CHARGERS ON THIS COMPUTER GRADE DEVICE. use the brick that it came with. Or at least a brick that distributes the same power supply. Samsung's galaxy tablet lines have very powerful bricks you can use those too. Oh and as for the apple ipad bricks, (not the iphone bricks, but the bigger IPAD bricks) those ipad bricks have some sort of restriction to other devices that require higher power. it can however charge a simple phone but I noticed that it won't charge my nexus 7 2013 nor my galaxy note 10.1 2014. That's probably how apple engineered the brick only to work with and ipad or something that requires lower voltage. SO STOP BLAMING THE VENUE ON THIS!!!\n\nThese IT guys think they know it all. Well they know absolutely nothing about consumer usage. I would have to admit that I am a little advanced because I like to search google and read forums on how to fix all things electronic. but that's really a problem with the world these days. No one wants to try to figure out how to fix things. they just want it to be fixed already.\n\nFirefox and chrome work JUST fine! They are not optimized for touch but they can in fact pinch zoom. It just looks kinda like how you would hold control and press + or -. so it looks choppy. That's understandable since Mozilla and google decided not to make their browser experience a priority on windows 8. They are working on it so give it some time. right now it works just like it did on my Asus gamer laptop. its snappy but touch is satisfactory.\n\nI'd like to hear some comments from the complainers giving the venue 1-2 stars. they are probably too ignorant anyway about technology that they ... I don't know its just mind boggling to me.\n\nI give it 4 stars because its not perfect. but its pretty darn close!!!!!"}

The size and weight is perfect to read with the Kindle app even with one hand due to the sculptured back plate.\n\nA couple thoughts for new owners that I had to learn:\n\nFirst off, go to the Dell Support website and update the drivers and the programs as others have noted.  The downloads will make the tablet function better.\n\nSecond, if you are installing an SD card please be aware that unless you link your media folders on the SD card to your Windows libraries the default videos, music and photo apps in the metro/modern screen will not see them.  Here's a link that show's you how to do it:  [...]\n\nThird, be aware that all those micro USB cables that you have may not charge the tablet.  This tablet draws a lot of amps as seen in the 2 amp OEM charger that was provided.  Unless the micro USB cable is \"charge only\" you can't charge the tablet from your desktop or laptop USB ports.  Here's a link that describes it all:  [...]  Basically, I sliced open a micro USB cable and shorted the two data wires together so the tablet was able to draw full amps/power from the USB ports and now I can charge from my desktop and laptop USB ports."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "Used Android for a while and love it for what it is. Now Dell and Windows 8.1 have changed the tablet game. I have read a lot of reviews comparing this device to others on the market so I want to balance some of the comments I have read. This tablet has the new intel Z3740D atom quad core chip. Some other models have the Z3740 and say it is better. That would be true if you could upgrade the ram which you can't. So if you look at the specs the intel d chip actually runs faster with the 2gb ram than the non d chip. d stands for dual channel which you can only run if you have two ram chips.  Other complaints have said the one micro usb port makes this tab a toy. I disagree. While more ports are always better you can buy adapters to make this tablet turn into a full desktop pc. Check youtube if you don't believe me. Of course I bought a tablet to use as a tablet. It is nice to have the options though. So why buy this over other models on the market? Lets be frank at this time tablets on windows ate still new and price is a huge factor. This dell costs as much as a Nexus 7 and as nice as the n7 is it can't do what my Dell can do. Most of these new quad core windows tabs are costing close to $300or just above and I paid significantly less. So while this unit does not have gps, hdmi, or the z3740 it does have a beautiful screen, solid build, nice textured back, super thin, good sound, and I have to say Windows 8.1 is rather nice. I like having the amount of fine grain controls that windows allows along with the option of installing any program I want. Being able to browse in true desktop mode. Having a full office suite installed free is a huge advantage as well. This device is so good I sold my 2012 nexus 7. To be honest the gps on a tablet works ok but my samsung gs4 works a lot better so there is no need for that for me. Being able to have multiple windows open and running multiple programs at once on this tab made me see the vision Microsoft had. This is not a stripped down device but a fully functioning pc in a tablet. Microsoft needs to add pinch and zoom to desktop mode to make it really usable but I can't see going back to a mobile platform after using this tablet. Again to have so much functionality for the price is amazing. The processor on this tablet outperforms my top of the line laptop from a few years ago. amazing. So if you are a little bit nerdy and techy like me then you will love this device. If you are expecting it to do everything and want a million apps then another platform or more expensive device might be better suited for you. If you have wanted a tablet that is truly portable, built well, that runs full windows and can actually do work with this is it. I am really impressed with this device. Windows 8.1 is coming along nicely and although there is a learning curve from Windows 7 android or ios it is pretty usable. Settings are buried all over the place which can be frustrating but overall for touch it is great!!"}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "This seems to be a well-built tablet for a great price. However, after spending a week just trying to use it, I have found it has just too many frustrations. First, like any PC, it needs updates. The Dell utility for checking for driver updates is right there on the start menu - a promising start. However, theor 'system analysis' software would never successfully download or install under IE. I switched the default browser to Chrome, and it finally installed. Seems Dell's website does not work properly with IE in this regard, Once the analysis software runs, you are presented with a list of drivers to be updated. However, after installing each one, the analysis software presents me with the same list. It is apparently not able to determine which drivers need updating, and which have already been updated to the latest. Very poor behavior.\n\nHowever, the biggest frustration is trying to use this with any program in the desktop mode. The touch screen lags, hangs, and generally makes it very difficult if not impossible to select small icons and check boxes. This would theoretically be solved with the active stylus, except that it is not available anywhere, and the Dell product page for it is a dead link. Perhaps just as well, since the reviews on it are pretty much bad across the board.\n\nMy purpose in purchasing this tablet was to get a true MS Office implementation in a small tablet form - something which no iOS app or Android app has been able to give me (yet). I'll hang onto it for a bit longer in case they get the stylus issues worked out. But if you need a good responsive tablet, stay away from this one. It is just not well done, despite what seems to be excellent hardware."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "My experience with the Venue 8 when it first came out was negative due to some software issues that plagued early units. I originally bought the 32GB version but returned it because it performed poorly, had screen problems and a complete lack of storage space.\n\nAfter about a month I bought the 64GB version and folio case. After performing the software updates from Dell, my opinion of this device has completely changed for the better.\n\nFirst off, I do not recommend the 32GB version at all. With Office included and other software loaded, there is virtually no drive space left and the 32GB models seem to suffer performance issues in part due to this restriction. Furthermore, if a user wants to install apps, they can only be installed on the primary drive, not flash memory cards and once the drive is eaten up from apps, the performance issues only become exacerbated.\n\nThe 64GB model listed here is the sweet spot and is well worth the $30 increase in cost for precious storage space. After running this unit for over a week now, it performs very well in all areas and has surpassed my expectations of a 8\" Windows tablet. The quality of the unit is impressive and feels solid in your hand. The Venue 8 is fairly thin and does not have that cheap plasticky feel that competing tablets have.\nThe screen is clear and bright now with the update from Dell that corrected initial complaints of a dim screen which was a real problem. This update did not sacrifice battery life at all. I've been pleasantly surprised at how great the battery life is with moderate use all day. Windows 8.1 comes installed and runs very good. At this size, you can easily see how Windows was never intended for this form factor. Using apps that run on the desktop have very small text and trying to click on links within menus can be a problem without a mouse or pen input device. Apps designed for Windows 8 run well since they were designed for touch base usage but legacy apps can and often do have issues. The Venue 8 is certainly no desktop replacement as a device you carry around.\nAll of these tablets are short in the ports department and the Venue 8 is no exception. There is only a micro USB port, headphone jack and micro SD port. I bought a OTC cable so I can plug in a full sized USB device, however you cannot charge the device when using the USB port.\nAt the moment there are very few optional accessories for the Venue 8. Dell offers a folio case which I did buy, an active stylus and a keyboard that has not been released yet. The folio case is a nice way to protect you Venue 8 from bumps and scrapes. It does not have a magnetic cover so you must be careful that the flap does not open when putting the tablet in a bag exposing the screen . One complaint I have is how difficult it is to remove the Venue 8 from the folio case when you need to. The case covers the SD card slot so it must be removed to reach it. It seems as though you could damage the tablet trying to remove it because it fits so tightly inside and snaps into place. The active stylus is currently rating a 1 star on Dell's site and is probably the most hated accessory they have. The negative reviews about it performance sent me over to the Microsoft Store to buy a Jot pen which works on any touch screen device and works well on this tablet but lacks active functions.\n\nMy final recommendation is to say that this tablet is a great buy for anyone interested in a small form factor Windows tablet. Its solid construction, great screen and battery life make this a perfect companion device to take anywhere and can even fit into some coat pockets. The performance is solid and even runs games without lagging or stuttering like last years CPU's were known for. With the addition of Microsoft Office 2013 pre-installed, the price point simply cannot be beat."}

I use it for internet browsing, checking email, listening to music, reading magazines, checking weather.  It will be the device I use for traveling. It replaces a 1st generation iPad.  I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it is to use.  I really liked my iPad but this is a good replacement at a much cheaper price."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "When Acer came out with their 8\" Windows tablet, I thought that was going to be great. Then came to find out the reason it was so cheap was because of the lackluster TN panel they used for the display that would have the colors wash out at the slightest angle. Top it off with a very poor touch response, and the two most important things on a tablet are very poor, which in turn, make the whole device just plain bad.\n\nThe Dell Venue 8 Pro is certainly a step up. It's a zippy little device, but ultimately, suffers from the same problems. The display is nothing special at all. There isn't anything particularly wrong with it, but in a world dominated by 400+ PPI, anything in the 150ish range just looks like you're looking at a zoomed in Bitmap. Tablets this small are used for reading and consumption when you're in bed, holding the device less than an armslength away, so poor displays are very obvious and not really usable in my opinion.\n\nMy biggest problem is the touch response. I find myself tapping the 'X' to close apps, or clicking 'Submit' on a website like 15x before it finally registers my tap. It's a complete dealbreaker when I Apple and Andoid have similarly priced options in the same category of small tablets, with better screens and usability.\n\nOverall, if you need Windows on a small form factor tablet, I guess this is your best option. If you're looking for something to replace your iPad Mini, Nexus 7, Kindle Fire HDX, etc...keep looking, this isn't it."}

It's slick and pretty nice resolution. I added another 32 GB SD card which gives me ample room.

I wish they had switched the sleep button with the windows button on the top.\n\nMy other problem is not with the tablet, but with windows 8.1 which has no options for me to change the sleep mode during media streaming/play.

Win 8: angry birds, cut the rope and maybe a couple more but that is it, no more selection of good games.  Also very limited in all category of apps.\nMicro USB with no power - can't connect peripherals like mice and keyboards, thumb drive that need power directly.  Converter micro USB to full USB (not so common and hard to find)\nScreen resolution - with such small text and icons I need higher resolution to see everything clearer.  Experience not so pleasant, but at least it gets very bright.\nKeyboard not so good - bad lay out with number pad next to keyboard, can't type fast if punch 2 keys close to the same time keys stop typing\n\nOverall this is an improvement toward the path of a possible great product, but it's not there yet.  Having full usable windows and a great tablet experience is like the chupacabra, at this point it's a mythical figure.  Maybe venue 11 pro will make win 8 more usable, but the great tablet experience is still missing form windows 8."}

It barely functioned well as a tablet due to the terribly incomplete OS, and the apps were unbelievably lacking.  I bought this to also be an ereader and found the kindle app is incomplete (no magazines for windows), and the only game I bought ($7 for a halo game in the market and shown in ads of this device) would not run due to screen issues and screen orientation assumptions (developer knows and may fix it next month).  While you can install desktop apps, they are so small as to be barely visible on the screen, and the use of the keyboard in desktop apps was not intuitive.  There seems ro be an embargo on Google apps in windows as no apps are available (you can load Chrome and open it in windows 8 mode).  Media is very expensive in the xbox store ($20 for movies is not uncommon).  One day in and a spyware infection on the device (slipped by antivirus ) had me need to run malwarebytes.  Running that made the tablet unbootable.  This thing is not a tablet and its not a desktop PC .  Its the worst of both."}

Otherwise the tablet far exceeds the apple tablets in productivity. For all you CAD users, I have a full version of Microstation v8 Series 3 installed and it not only works, but it works well! For a $250 tablet this is mind boggling. Apple users will notice minor differences between this tablet and the iPad in fit and finish of both hardware and software, but Dell and Microsoft are very close in producing a superior product, regardless of price.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "Within an hour of turning on my newly purchased Dell Venue Pro 8 it went into frozen screen mode.  I noticed that the screen was not performing correctly from the outset because the left ~ 25% side of the screen would not respond to fingertouches  initially there was no problem with the the right 75% of the screen.  I assumed that the calibration was off so I touch calibrated the screen  it was downhill from that point.  The screen mostly stopped responding to touches.  I was able to get the charms sidebar to slide out but the PC settings screen key was unresponsive so I was unable to reset the tablet.\n\nThere is no hard reset button/combination so if the screen locks down you cannot reset it because the screen soft reset option is deactivated.  There was no OTG cable provided with the tablet so that an attempt could be made with a mouse  however, that is not a solution, because who is going to carry a cable and a mouse with them to unfreeze an 8 tablet  but this is speculation because the screen appeared cooked from the outset since the left side of the screen was not working out of the box.\n\nThis tablet is not well conceived  why would the designers not include a hard reset button combination  it seems like a common sense necessity particularly in a tablet.  However, the main problem with this tablet is that there appears to be a serious quality control issue with respect to the screen touch response quality.  I am returning the tablet to Amazon.\n\nMany of the positive reviews seem overstated  my five year old HP Ipaq outclasses this tablet in many respects."}

It is very, very slick. Couldn't be more portable. My issues: Great screen but my eyes are older and it's kind of hard to see at times. My fault, not the system as it is sharp and clear. Also, W8 is good news/bad news. Obviously designed for tablets but there is a learning curve. I'm competent technically but really don't want to take the time right now when everything else I do is W7. With decent eyes and willing to use W8 this would be a winner.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "This was a Christmas gift yesterday morning. Spent all day setting it up and charged it to around 90%. Used it a lot so tried to charge before going to bed and the charge light wouldn't come on. Tried various power outlets - didn't resolve. Googled and found many people having the same issue. Someone suggested installing all Dell recommended updates inc firmware would fix the problem. Tried that did not resolve. Now down to around 30% charge left so unless a miraculous fix is found it looks like this will have to be sent back.\nI will say that I noticed immediately the non-proprietary usb charger which shipped with it is a very bad fit. The connector does not sit in the port properly. When I get to civilization after the holiday I may try to buy another one although have tried my Samsung usn phone cable and that fits exactly the same way (not totally snug) and doesn't work either.\nVery disappointing Dell. really looks from everything I'm reading on the forums that this product was not tested fully before shipping.\nI like the look and functionality of the machine but without power....!\n\nSee Update review following this - hence I have changed to 4* rating now"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I was really on the fence about getting this tablet, but to my surprise most of the reviews were very positive.  As a gift to myself I ordered one.  I currently have a First Generation Surface RT, but I was wanting something smaller that is easier to hold with a single hand to control my Xbox One or surf the web, something to replace my Gen 1 iPad from back in the day.  So I pulled the trigger and ordered a DVP. I like it so much, I order 2 more as gifts the following week.\n\nFirstly, for everyone, please take note.  Go to Dell.com and install all of the latest drivers as soon as you complete the initial setup. [...]  This will address all of the issues other reviewers have noted.  Install the BIOS update and there is also an Urgent touch panel firmware update. The BIOS update will require that your tablet is plugged in. I suggest going to the drivers and download page, saving it as a favorite, and then just go down the list and install each and every single one.  There is also a fix for the Ambient Light Sensor that was just released on December 17th. Unless I am missing something, there is not an application on the tablet to install these for you. Why Dell or Microsoft hasn't found a way to better streamline this, especially for consumers, is beyond me. I have newer Dell PC's at work that have a tool to find and install these updates for you. Now on to my review.\n\nThis is not an Ultrabook or a Laptop, obviously.  Given the price point, this is meant to directly compete with the iPad Mini (Non-Retina Version) and similar sized Android Tablets.  Keep that in mind going forward, this isn't meant to compete with the iPad Air; that is what the Microsoft Surface is for. As for the iPad Mini with Retina, there really is no competition for that, yet.\n\nDesign:\n\n I really like the textured back on the DVP, it is easy to grip and Im not worried about it slipping from my hand.  It is very comfortable to hold, even for reading on the Kindle App single handed.\n\n The resolution is higher than that of the iPad Mini (Non-Retina Version). The black levels are also very nice.  When watching a movie, skin tones and colors are true.\n\n There is a Micro-SD slot on the side.  I did find it a bit challenging to get the card to click in the slot. I initially thought it did not have a mechanism to secure it, but after pushing the card in deeper, it clicked.  And be mindful to review the manual, I was trying to remove the speaker cover at first by accident.  Oops.\n\n Start Button.  I have to give Dell kudos on moving the button.  Having a Windows Phone and a Surface, I adjusted in no time to the different placement of the Start Button. Dell is known to put a lot of research into ergonomics and study how people actually use a product.  This is apparent as users will be using this tablet with a single hand or with a hand on each side of the tablet.  So having the button on the side makes perfect sense. I do occasionally press the power button instead, but mainly because the tablet is so versatile and Im constantly going from landscape to portrait.\n\n Charger and Cable: The cable is simply too short, way too short.  I think Dell should have taken a cue from Microsoft since the Surface Charger & Cable are much longer by comparison.\n\n The standard front and back facing cameras are on par with most cell phones.  This isn't a Nokia Lumia.\nPerformance & Storage\n\n Compared to my Surface RT, this tablet dances circles around it.  Its very snappy and quick.  Items load very fast. Even after having 8 applications open, I notice no reduction in speed.  I am not finding any bugs.  Then again, I installed all new drivers and Windows Updates before using it. This is not like the netbooks from back in the day that moved at a snails pace.\n\n Start Up is very fast.\n\n I highly recommend getting the 64GB version, youll be surprised how fast you can fill up your storage, especially with movies.  I have about 50GB available after installing MS Office Professional Plus via my companies Office 365 Account. (Not the home version that comes with the tablet.)  I do have a 64GB Micro SD installed as well for any movies and music I download.\n\n Ambient Sensor: Even after the latest update, I don't care for it.  I have done the same on my Surface RT.  With a gesture of your right thumb, you can manually adjust the brightness on the fly, which I prefer.  The only device I have a feature like this enabled is my Nokia Lumia 920. And if memory serves me correctly, it took Nokia about a year and three updates to get it right.  So maybe in time. But its not a deal breaker since I can turn that feature off.\n\n Battery Life: So far so good.  Its lasting way longer than my Surface RT to my surprise. Ive been able to go a full day without having to charge it.  Additionally, it charges back up very fast.\n\nThis tablet was built and priced to compete with other midrange tablets in the market today.  So there isn't a full sized USB Port, Mini or Full Sized HDMI, or even Qi Wireless Charging.  All of those things make it more expensive, bigger, and heavier.  Out of everything, yes, I really do wish it had wireless charging more than anything else others think it should have. Keep in mind, it does have Bluetooth if you must have a peripheral.\n\nUtilize the additional Microsoft Services to fully unlock the potential.  SkyDrive is a huge part of this because it can give you access to files on the fly without having to download them and take up memory.  You can select items and folders to keep synced for offline use if you choose.  Having an Xbox Music Pass is also great because you can download anything you want offline or stream anything you want for a monthly fee.  Ive used Xbox Music (Formerly Zune) for almost four years and I do not miss iTunes at all.  I do wish the SIM slot was on this, but with having the ability to tether a phone and rumors that Windows Phone will allow Bluetooth data connections to Windows 8 tablets in the near future, Im not sure if its something I will really miss in the end.  Also keep in mind that if you have other Windows 8 devices, you're settings, favorites, and even your background image will sync to those devices if you choose. Even Wi-Fi Access Keys!\n\nWindows 8 is search centric. So get out of the mindset of click here, then click there, etc. etc. Use the Search Charm and just simply type whatever you want to open or access.  For desktop users, W8 makes a lot more sense after you experience it on a tablet. Experiences that you can then apply to your laptop or desktop without the touch gestures. One of which is learning that the Settings Charm gives you the settings for whatever you currently have open.  If you have the mail app open, youll get the settings for the mail app.  If you have the start screen or desktop showing, youll get the PC Settings. The built in Sharing Charm is also great as you can quickly share a web page, document, etc. with not only email, but Facebook, Twitter, and more if you have those applications installed.\n\nOverall I think the value is superb. With the Venue you have access to a full PC experience, Quad Core Intel Atom, 64GB of storage, a expandable storage option, and Microsoft Office 2013 included at no additional cost.\n\n*Windows is running a promotion for a $25.00 Windows Gift Card with the purchase of a Windows 8.1 Touch PC or Tablet.  I have reached out to Amazon to find out that status of this is. There is no mention of this on Amazon.com and I have not received a promo code via email. I will post an update once I get a response."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I was able to also evaluate the larger earlier generation of Dell windows tablet, the XPS 10 (larger tablet), in comparison with this tablet.  This tablet has limitations, but for a small tablet, it's fantastic.\nI'm using it for reading (news and kindle), taking notes, playing MP3s (mostly lectures rather than music for me), and for a specific legacy windows application.\n\nSo to begin with, it's amazing that this little tablet really has all the power that my windows desktop has.  It's the full Windows 8 / Windows legacy experience.  Every time I go to the windows 7 / desktop side and see that every feature is still there, I'm amazed.  I use a legacy windows application that's actually a bit sluggish even on my 64-bit desktop and it's just as responsive on this tablet!\nThat's where the dual-processor helps that the first-generation windows dell tablet lacked.\n\nEven though it's a full windows OS, this tablet is a step down from the larger tablets because it lacks a USB-in port that you would need in order to use a keyboard or transfer files to a thumb drive.  If you have that (as with the larger windows tablets), you have a laptop/tablet hybrid.  This tablet is not that, but that's fine.\n\nREADING: I use the built-in \"reading list\" app among the other news, health, and sports apps.  The reading list would be better if it would cache articles for offline reading, but that will probably come soon.  Reading on this tablet's form factor is *perfect* for me.  The kindle app only accesses books (not documents that I upload), so that sucks (wtf, amazon?), but I expect that will be corrected soon as well.  As for reading, this tablet doesn't have quite the real estate that the larger tablet had for holding it (your thumb needs to stay a bit closer to the edge), but it's still fine and it's not heavy (again, all this power in a such a small tablet).\nNOTES: it's both good and bad that you can't just use any old stylus on this tablet.  It's bad that you have to purchase it from dell separately, but it's good because it rocks.  It's a smart stylus such that when you're using it, your hand isn't activating all sorts of other stuff (only does what you expect).  You can also access context menus with it.  Also, since the desktop side is not specifically designed for tablets (won't zoom using finger gestures), the stylus makes selection easier.  I also use it for my legacy application.  Taking notes in OneNote is absolutely the best way of taking notes ever.  If you're unfamiliar with OneNote, get familiarized.  This tablet comes with a full Office license (which OneNote is part of) BTW.  I'm sure some users will make use of (for instance) creating and being  able to present full PowerPoint presentations.\nAPPS:  Granted, the windows store doesn't have the selection that the android/apple stores do, but the built-in apps rock, and you can install any legacy windows application (although you may need the stylus to easily operate those apps).\nCAMERA: The camera is only 5 megapixels, and struggles to focus on my device.  Not very good, but will work in a pinch.  The larger tablets work much better in this area, but again, that's not what I'm using this small tablet for.\nOne negative note; the USB cable that comes with the device is for charging only; it has no data, plugging it into a desktop to transfer files won't work.  You'd have to separately purchase a different cable for that.  Oh well, there's always SkyDrive.\nTaking the price, power, responsiveness, ease of use (I grant that younger or inexperienced users won't fully understand when things switch between the Windows 8 to desktop/legacy mode but for me it's no problem and the desktop side is just so full-featured I love having it), I can't imagine a better tablet."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "First: very fast delivery service from Amazon.  Excellent price, too.\n\nSecond: The quality and look of the Venue are top notch.  I had seen it originally in an Office Depot, I think, and really liked the look and feel of it.  Light, thin, and excellent screen quality.  Great for book reading, laying in bed, sitting on the porch, or even the porcelain throne.\n\nAnd so forth:  Windows 8.1, what's not to like?  Fast, lots of free apps, and Dell includes MS Office 2013 Student edition already installed.  That's $100 right there.  Navigating 8.1 has a bit of a learning curve, maybe 10 minutes.  Others who complain about it just are too stuck in their ways to calm down and give it some thought.  It's pretty intuitive so go with the flow.  Now, I have been using several different 4.8\" UMPCs for many years.  I like the fact that I can slip my Viliv S5 or N5 or Raon Digital Everun in my pocket and off I go.  Yes, they may be slow and under powered, but for my use they are great.  And still going strong after many years.  So, what to do with the much larger Venue?  I tried carrying it around in a binder for a few days but my daughter thought I looked like a geek.  Kids these days.  But after giving it some thought I knew she was right.  So I planned to send it back.  But, it kept calling my name and I couldn't get passed the ease of use, the great screen, the 8.1 speed and utility, so I made the final decision, yes...\n\nNot so good:  The stylus.  It's awful.  Touch with a finger is fine.  I'd give it an 8 out of ten.  The stylus, which Dell sells separately for $30, stinks.  It's just unusable.  , It hovers, double clicks, works randomly, and has a mind of it's own.  It was another reason I wanted to return the Venue, but I ordered a Bluetooth mouse which should be fine for my use.  I don't really ink much, so it's not a deal killer.  But if inking is your thing, beware.  Oh, and I called Dell to get an authorization for return, and was online with their chat for 55 minutes trying to explain that I needed authorization and a return shipping label.  Yes, 55 minutes.  Not waiting for 55 minutes, actually trying explain what I needed.  Oh my.\n\nMine is the 64GB model, which for the extra $ is worth it because the 32GB gets it's space used up very quickly with the OS, Office, apps, etc.  Most people report 10-15 GB left open to start with.\n\nLast, there is an excellent users forum which is very helpful, though of course most people on there are complaining so it is what it is.  But it will give you a good idea of the pros and cons of the Venue.\n\nTo sum it up, this is a full 100% Windows 8.1 experience, has Office 2013, lots of apps, very fast WiFi (two radios), good touch, excellent quality build and feel.  Got it for $299 on Amazon special.  Have to take away one star for the horrendous stylus just to warn others that this is a problem if you are intending to use the Venue for note taking, etc.  BTW, Dell is working on updating the stylus firmware, but it may just be the crappy pen/hardware that's the problem."}

I'm a fire fox browser fan and attempted to install it on other devices, but you don't get the same stellar fire fox experience as you do in desktops- till now! After the size annoyed me I bought a Microsoft Surface 2, this will NOT run legacy apps! The Surface pro is just to expensive and the latest reviews on the Lenovo thinkpad 8 are horrible. This little guy can only charge with the correct watt adapter, so if you try to use an older phone charger, it won't work. Otherwise, it's fast and very responsive.

This fills a role in between a full PC and a tablet.  It is tiny so it is a mind blower that this is basically a touchscreen netbook in your hand. Full windows and windows 8 experience is pretty cool.\n\nSize: At this size it is small enough for any bag but you'd need a pretty big pocket to heft this thing, it is right at home on your counter, desk, or couch.\n\nStorage:  don't plan to put much on the hard drive - lots of word files would be fine but at 32 gb total space, usable space is under 10gb at the start.  Expandable SD is cool for your music or videos or work files but you won't want to fill that internal storage.\n\nPorts and features:  The single USB port is a little light - it means you won't be charging while using USB mice, keyboards, or whatnot.  This does well with Bluetooth keyboards and mice. Great to have full windows networking.  I've ordered an OTG adapter which should let me.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I have owned numerous tablets over the years. I have owned iPads, and the two Nexus 7 tablets.

I have Hulu, and Netflix at my disposal. Office is on the device, free of charge (Outlook is not included). If I need to access my company network, I can. This has Java, and it has run seamlessly so far. I find the Windows Store to be more limiting than other stores, but I have all the essential applications that I need. I do not need a million flashlight apps at my disposal. You can also install full Windows applications. This is not ideal at times, but it is there if you need it. The same cannot be said for the competitors.\n\nThe hardware is very good. I will not say it has the polish of an iPad, but it works great nonetheless. The device is very light, and sturdy. I would highly recommend a case, and at this price you will not feel guilty having to spend an extra few dollars. I also like the fact that it has expandable storage. I purchased a 64 GB card for approximately $40.\n\nOverall, this is an exceptional tablet when you consider the sum of its parts. It is not perfect, but no tablet is. If you enjoy additional flexibility, and want a tablet at a great value, then look no further."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "This is an unreviewable item in its totality. It's utterly maddening: highs, lows, nothing in between. The best possible argument for the Apple way of doing things, where the hardware and software seem to have been created by the same species of organism. This is the opposite of that. 3 stars is the mean created by 1s and 5s.\n\nThe Hardware You Touch\nDell apparently hires engineers from other planets, with fingers that go different places from ours.\n16x9 is a dumb aspect ratio for a tablet. It's just odd-feeling. 16x10 or 3x4 works better. Within the confines of that bad decision, I suppose the volume buttons are in the right place, and the headphone jack is sort of OK, but everything else is really bad. The power button (a tiny silver chicklet on the edge) and the Windows button (a tiny silver chicklet on the edge) are both hard to find when you want them, and too easy to hit accidentally. Not as genius as the first-generation Kindle Fire, where the power button on the bottom of the device was easily activated by, say, resting the device on your chest or lap, but close. That said, the actual finish and solidity are incredible for a sub-$300 device. Ten years ago, you could have sold this for $3k.\n\nThe screen is bright but compared to the high-res devices (Nexus 7, iPad mini retina), it's grainy. Then again, I got this for $199, so I don't get to complain about that. The speakers are great. The little door on the microSD slot is one of those bad little rubbery doors that always feels like it's going to break off. The cameras are bad.\n\nIt charges through one of those idiotic micro-USB ports that needs a special adapter to act like a USB host device. It's next to impossible to figure out which way to put the charging cord in.\n\nThe Hardware You Can't Touch\nIncredible. After almost getting run over by ARM (the processors in most tablets and phones), the quad-core \"Bay Trail\" Intel Atom in this does great. Zippy and power-sippy. If they had this even three years ago, the Intel/ARM landscape would look very different. Network performance is great, even Bluetooth range is noticeably good. Five stars for this one.\n\nThe Software\nOh, Microsoft. One has to weep. Windows 8.1 is so palpably unfinished and under-thunk. You can't find anything, you keep needing to fish in the Desktop world to get anything done, even the live-tile thing is so fiddly you wish it would go away.\n\nThe App Store is even sadder. There are no \"metro\" new-world apps for, say, Spotify, or Pandora. The NY Times app is so bad, clearly no one there is taking Windows seriously any more. (It's December 2013, and its live tiles are still showing photos and headlines about Mitt Romney. That suggests it's been broken for 13 months and nobody there noticed, or cared to do anything about it.)\n\nAs you've heard, the software is a bear. On the 32Gb model, there was, I think, 11Gb actually available for the end-user when I turned it on. Some of that is a restore partition, but what are you going to do to delete that? No instructions are provided.\n\nThe Dell crapware is all crappy. Installing new drivers requires navigating the Dell site, downloading ZIPs of EXEs that spawn temp directories - everything we were doing in 1993. They don't seem to understand the tablet mentality at all.\n\nThe Bottom Line\nI spent some of the last two weeks, including most of today, using this at work, because the only way I can work remotely is to run a Citrix client on a Windows or Mac host. With a bluetooth keyboard, it's basically a cheap netbook that you can use as an e-reader, but with substantially better performance than the 2008-era netbook heyday. But as a competitor to a Nexus 7 or iPad Mini... well, it's cheaper than one of them, and Bay Trail is awesome."}

However ultimately I returned this tablet due to the excessive heating issues. Just charging the tablet (without using it) causes the back to get warm. Simple web browsing (no multi-tasking) causes the tablet to get very, very warm. And as a previous reviewer stated, it can't be good for any electronic device to get this warm. It will cause damage sooner than later. I want my tablet to be around for a few years and the heating issues just didn't sit well with me."}

Super light, almost pocketable size makes it really easy to just pick up and go anywhere with it. 10\" tablets always make me think (albeit only briefly) about were I'm going to stash it.\nBattery life has been pretty much right on the \"all day\" claim, assuming that you stop to eat every few hours and aren't playing online games and pooping in a diaper. I can surf the web essentially all day, at least as much as I can stand.\nScreen is good, but I've seen way better IPS panels than this one. Brightness is good when you disable the auto-management function. People who bitch that the resolution is too low have NO idea what they're talking about. The screen is only 8 inches! Any higher resolution and you'll need a magnifying glass to see the menus. Seriously. This is Windows, not Android and it handles DPI differently.\nPerformance is impressive considering there's no active cooling at all on this. The combination of quad-cores and SSD makes everything very snappy. The processor benchmarks similarly to a Core2Duo and just under some of the slower Core i3 chips. Processor heavy apps won't be impressed (haven't tried Photoshop or anything like that) but everything else runs smoothly.\nReally does cold boot in seconds and resumes from sleep instantly.\nSingle micro USB port can't simultaneously charge the device and run USB peripherals without a little trickery. That said I've seen video of it running quad external displays with a keyboard and mouse all through the one USB port no problem. If you're really determined you could run it as a dockable desktop. I got a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse for mine to eliminate that concern.\nWindows 8.1. I don't use Metro apps much, they either don't have what I need or suck 80% of the time. I set mine to boot to desktop. Having said that the Metro apps that don't suck are GREAT. Netflix, Adobe, Amazon, and a few random games rock.\nBuilt-in Office 2013 works well with touch and you can tell they put some thought into it.\n\nBottom line: Good performance and the most portable full Windows experience money can buy. Small screen hinders getting heavy work done so you have to ask yourself which side of the \"portability versus visibility\" balance you prefer. I'm happy."}

And this tablet comes with a full version of Microsoft Office, enabling me to continue work started on my PC on the tablet.  I loaded a Start button app available free from the store and that helped with the transition from Win 7.  I found apps for all the tasks and tools I used on my Android, so while the selection is not great I found everything I needed.\n\nThe SkyDrive provided free set up easily and was surprisingly useful.  With a bit of work, I set up a home group and was able to copy about 8gb of music from my PC to the tablet.  Then the Xbox music player found it and imported my playlists, a real surprise.

I can print to my printer on home network, I can access my files on NAS, I can move files freely just like what I do on my PC. It does take time to find the correct way to use windows 8.

(Hard-Drive-Intel_Chipset_WW48_PR5.1_A03_ZPE.exe). I also updated BIOS.\n3. Once above all done, connect Push2TV to TV through HDMI. If nothing showed up on TV, Push2TV went to sleep. You can push the side button on Push2TV to wake it up.\n4. On your tablet, open the charm bar, click the device icon, then click Project. If it's first time use, click add wireless display, it will go the add device screen. Push2TV should show up, click it to connect. If it's the first time, a code will display on TV. Enter that code on your tablet when prompted to do so. Once connected, you can bring out the charm bar, then device, then project, you can pick which way to use TV, like mirror or extend etc.\n\nEnjoy."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "There are many reviews on this tablet across the internet so I'll try to not repeat everything that's been said before about it.\n\nI've had this product for a few weeks now and I really enjoy using it on a daily basis. Feels great in the hand and is the perfect screen size for a tablet in my opinion. I'm a designer so I use Adobe products (Illustrator, Photoshop, etc.) a lot, and wanted a tablet that was able to run these applications. I use the tablet for consumption about 95% of the time, but knowing that if I absolutely needed to fix something on a project last minute or change something around is a huge deal to me.\n\nI won't lie and say this things runs the Adobe Suite super well, because it is definitely slower than what most designers are (probably) used to on their main machines. That being said, it CAN run it, which is invaluable in case you need to get some last minute changes in order on something right before a deadline.\n\nThe only gripes I have against this tablet are software related, and they are relatively minor. For instance there is the lack of metro apps, or even the fact that some of the big named ones (Netflix for example) are kind of buggy. Does it kill the whole experience? Eh, not really. Since this is running full Windows you can just download the desktop version of an application if a metro version doesn't exist yet (i.e. Spotify), or in the case of Netflix use the web browser. I'm not gonna dock a star off for this negative because it isn't an issue with the DV8P, it is an issue with Windows that will surely get resolved with time.\n\nPersonally I find this tablet to be without a doubt the best choice at this price point because it has the ability to run powerful desktop applications pretty well which, to me, is invaluable in something this small, light, and efficient."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "Appearance and Buttons:\nThe Venue 8 Pro looks lovely.  There's a ridged rubber back with a metal Dell logo inscribed in the middle, and it's all just clean lines and soft edges everywhere.  It's also very thin and light.  9mm is not a lot of rare-earth metals to be holding, and it makes the whole thing look that much more modern and slick.\n\nThe volume and power buttons on the side are all clicky and responsive, and if you see someone complain about the Windows home button being on the top you have my permission to slap them (lightly) because there's no accidental brushing of a capacitive button smack in the middle of the device every 30 seconds.  It takes about 2 seconds of learning curve to know where it is/figure out that using the home button from the charms menu is easier anyway.\n\nDisplay:\nThis thing has a beautiful screen.  Seriously, Apple may have you convinced that you need 361ppi to be worth anyone's time, but as long as you've got an IPS display, it's going to look good.  178 viewing angles, strong contrast, good color reproduction I think (no weird reds or yellows or anything, at least).  It's glossy, but it also gets extremely bright so that's fine.  Make sure you turn off auto-brightness until Dell fixes the super-aggressive dimming with it.  Stop looking disdainfully at that 800p resolution, the tablet is shaking its head right back at you.\n\nAudio:\nThe single speaker is so loud I don't even understand.  I have not heard any computer get this loud, never mind a tiny 9mm thin one (probably those Asus ones with the bang and olufsen speakers, but they're also 3x thicker).  At those volume levels, sound gets distorted though so don't actually turn it up this loud unless you're in an obnoxious mood.  Again, one speaker so no surround, but that's fine for 90% of cases since it sounds pretty good with minimal tinniness.  Audio quality from the headphone jack is fine as far as I can tell, playing .flac files sounds how it should.  The placement of the speaker is at the \"bottom\" of the tablet, so if you're using it in landscape mode, you might cover it with your palm.  It's not hard to avoid doing that, though.\n\nPerformance:\nEverything loads snappily and continues to do so throughout the day.  I stay in desktop mode most of the time on Office and Chrome, and it warms up only very slightly.  Minecraft runs at a solid 20 fps with all the fancy settings on and far render distance, and totally smooth 40+ with medium and some stuff turned off.  Fallout 3 runs... passably.  I would guess about 20 fps on lowest settings.  That's all I tried for gaming but during both the poor tablet got pretty warm.  Not hot enough to make it uncomfortable to touch, but definitely noticeable.\n\nBattery life:\nIt will easily last someone using it all day, over 8 hours on Microsoft Word/OneNote.  Used intermittently with mostly just web-browsing or music listening, it took me a little under two days for this thing to finally end itself.  I meant to do an official battery test but I forgot what I was doing a few hours in...\n\nStylus:\nNo.  Apparently they're fixing it.  I bought this for note-taking with the stylus capabilities so they better fix it.......\n\nCompetition:\nThe competition is the Toshiba Encore, Acer Iconia W4, and Lenovo Ideapad Miix.  None of those three have a stylus and otherwise they're exactly the same thing so Dell wins.  If you're looking for a supercheap laptop replacement, get the Asus Transformer Book T100.\n\nConclusion:\nKeep in mind that you're looking at a $300 computer.  The fact that it looks so good, feels so sturdy, operates so smoothly, and has such a great battery life makes it a fantastic deal.  This is the definitive Windows tablet so far.\n\nAlso the Microsoft Store is utter trash and it makes me cringe every time I go there and see nothing useful at all to download/purchase.  Stick to the desktop or be a rich developer and make better things for Metro please."}

Windows 8 works great in tablet form and the added ability to use normal Windows Desktop, while not 100% the best in tablet, but the ability to run certain programs you're used to some of the time is just icing on the cake.\n\nThe 8in size is great as well.  It fits my needs of bigger than phone, smaller (and way lighter than even a light) laptop, but all the functionality I get from my laptop and desktop as its the same Windows 8!\n\nI would recommend after you buy it, buy a separate microSD card.  Another 32GB should work (for only like $17 at the time of this writing) to store music and videos on.  Adding some games and then a single downloaded video at HD quality through the XBox Video Store takes up a bunch of the remaining free space so extra space on the microSD card would be a good buy."}

First I will say I've owned several android tablets, including the 2013 Nexus 7, and an iPad, but this is my first windows tablet.  I love the size of the tablet, I think 8 inches is perfect, and it has reasonably small bezels.  The screen, while not 1080p, is great, and super bright once you turn off automatic brightness.  The build quality seems great, except for one problem and that is there is a gap between the glass cover and the side/back panel.  Where the glass ends and the side begins it should be essentially water tight, but there is a gap big enough I can see in a little bit, and even can see some white stuff, maybe its the adhesive, not sure.  Other than that, the only other complaint would be what everyone already knows, at that is lack of apps, especially google.  This really needs google native apps, at least for me.  and it needs voice to text integration as well, but if google ever releases official metro apps I'm sure they will include that.

I can honestly say it beats an Android or iOS anyday with its multitasking, charms bar, and swiping ability. And with this being full Windows you can download apps like Chrome, Spotify, Photoshop, etc.\n-The price is super reasonable. It's currently selling for $249 on Amazon ...that's incredible for a high-performing, full Windows device.\n- Pen support. This device supports an active digitizer, which is much better than the typical stylus many are used to.\n\nCons:\n-No video out (mini-hdmi). If you want to hook this up to an external monitor your main option is miricast, which isn't as convenient.\n-Memory. If you get the 32GB version be aware you will run through that memory very quickly. My advice would be to grab a 32 or 64GB microSD card, which can be bought on Amazon for around $20 and $40 respectively. That's probably cheaper than buying the 64 GB version of this device.\n\nOverall, this is the best thing Dell has made in a long time, and you won't be disappointed."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "It's a great mini-PC, good value, and a very convenient way to carry information. I manage personal paperwork electronically, mostly PDFs but also on OneNote. This tablet allows me to carry it all with me, all the time. OneNote caches all the data so it's all available offline. For other files I use SkyDrive, and use the \"make available offline\" option which keeps a local copy on the tablet. You can do some of this on an Android tablet, but not all. For example, the Android version of the OneNote client cannot access password-protected notes. The Venue 8 Pro comes with a FULL version of Microsoft Office, so there are no such limitations.\n\nBut it's not perfect. The screen resolution is mediocre compared to my Nexus-7 tablet. It only has an OTG USB port; it can be used to power the tablet, or to access a USB flash drive, but not both at the same time. I don't like the stylus (sold separately) - it is N-trig style, not Wacom, so you can't \"hover\" and move the cursor around without clicking. The stylus is also hard to write with, as the screen has very little friction. But even with these limitations, I feel it warrants 5 stars because of the affordable price and the fact that competing 8\" Windows tablets have the same (or worse) limitations.\n\nI struggled with the 32GB vs. 64GB choice, but I'm very glad I chose the 64GB for one specific reason: SkyDrive. You can move the SkyDrive sync folder to a micro-SD card, but only if the micro-SD card is formatted as NTFS. And most 64GB micro-SD cards cannot be formatted as NTFS. So if you buy a 32GB version of this tablet and want to sync a SkyDrive folder which is too large to fit on the internal memory, you are forced to use a 32GB micro-SD slot, and you're left with no further room for expansion."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I had a very specific problem -- as a podcaster, I needed a laptop or tablet to feed Skype through my studio mixer with a very specific pro USB microphone attached to it.  I was delighted to find the Dell Venue 8 Pro tablet -- it works perfectly for this purpose.  But if I was a user in the market for a tablet for personal use, I would be very disappointed. Compared to iOS and Android devices, this Windows 8 tablet is a half-baked Frankenstein device.\n\nWhat you get here is Windows 8 -- the full desktop version -- running on tablet hardware.  Great in theory, but in practice it is a bit of a mess.\n\nAlthough the start menu/home screen features Microsoft's tile UI which works great for a touch interface, you are constantly being bounced to the traditional desktop interface, where touch is approximating mouse clicks.  With no way to pinch and zoom in the desktop environment, you're trying to tap on items that are very very small.  As many of the applications are Windows 8 apps and not tablet touch apps, they have not been optimized for touch, therefore simple activities -- such as filling out forms -- can be very tricky.\n\nPairing a bluetooth keyboard and mouse with the tablet would probably yield better results, but then you lose the purpose of having a tablet.  Overall, I would strongly recommend an iPad Mini or an Android tablet (maybe a Samsung Galaxy) over Dell's 8 Pro."}

Hard to close apps from the \"x\", hard to select sub menus. Yes I have done all the updates\nWorst part is the Bluetooth won't hold a connection to my cell phone or laptop. This is most annoying, I will call Dell support but I expect little help.\nIt maintains a connection to my external Bluetooth speakers OK, but to the phone or PC only makes, then drops, the connection in seconds.\nIf anyone has a solution to Bluetooth please let me know.\nOne other issue I use Firefox, who really uses Explorer anymore? But Firefox will not let me drag icons on or off when customizing the toolbar. Very Odd.\nI am an experienced user. I would say size is good, screen B+, battery life medium, needs to be improved to 10 hours on 80 % screen brightness, auto dim feature not that great. I think next year Dell will have figured out how to get the bugs out on the 2014\nMaybe a pen that fits in the unit's body like the Samsung Note 8.0 ? Shave off some weight if possible.\nComes packaged nice. Comes with Office Home that you install after entering the reg #, but really you won't be using Excel on this screen, but maybe you can forward a file or look at one sent you. Power charging cable needs to be 24\" longer (or buy an extension) so you can read in bed.\nAlso the volume control and power button should be on top they are way too easily hit and there should be a recessed Windows key at the bottom of the screen not on top. Also there is a need more after market accessories, like folios and pens. Dell's prices on these are too high."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "...are amazing.\n\nThis device was discounted pretty heavily for \"cosmetic damage\" on the packaging.  It said that there would be a puncture or some kind of laceration on the box of noticeable proportions.  I expected a hole from a box cutter or a crushed corner or something, but when I opened it I found no damage whatsoever.  The exterior \"sleeve\" box that had all the specifications and such did seem a bit worn.  Not scraped or anything, it just didn't look new.  It is hard to explain, but essentially it wasn't as glossy as it probably should have been.  For that, I saved upwards of $60.  As a gift that will be given out of the box anyway, this was even less of a concern than my near nonexistent concern about the supposed \"damage\" that warranted the discount.  And to top it all off, shipping was free with Prime and speedy as usual.\n\nI couldn't be happier.\n\nAs far as the device itself is concerned, I won't bother reviewing it since there are literally hundreds of them online from various customers and tech news outlets alike.  Overall, the Dell Venue 8 Pro is probably the best cheap Win8.1 tablets on the market.  Keep in mind, though, that it only has a micro-USB port, so any simultaneous peripheral connections, video out, and charging must be done with a specialty splitter/adapter.  That is really my only gripe.  Oh, and that Dell hasn't came out with a matching, folio compatible keyboard like for the Venue 11.  But you cannot really complain about any 8\" device running full Windows for $240."}

Battery lasts several days of intermittent use around the home before charging is needed.\n\nWorks great as a second screen device while watching TV especially with Xbox One SmartGlass app. I tend to leave the Venue 8 Pro near TV / Game Controllers.  I have all the Windows 8 apps I need for social media interactions and content consumption.\n\nCamera is acceptable in well lighted situations though not as good as my Windows 8 Phone.  There is no flash.  Video cam works well for Skype calls.\n\nI have added a 64Gig SD Card for extra storage and locate various pictures and music files for when I travel.  At home between  SkyDrive, Xbox Live cloud services and Home Network I have little need for local storage.\n\nDell utilities are useful and do not attempt to duplicate Windows 8.1 management features.  Dell Update app keeps drivers and firmware current - There have been several updates published since receiving the machine including an important firmware update.\n\nNice having Office included with the machine.  However, I do prefer a larger screen to do any significant amount of real work."}

It runs full Outlook, but you have to install your own copy separately. You can add 64GB of memory easily for about $40. I got mine for $199, so it was worth trying.\n\nHOWEVER, the onscreen keyboard is HORRID, FRUSTRATING, DIFFICULT. Did I say BAD? Samsung's keyboard is FAR superior. If that's important, I'd suggest the Galaxy Note. I haven't done so, but I imagine a Bluetooth keyboard would work. But then that defeats part of the purpose of a tablet -- not having bulky accessories.\n\nYou will also find that there are a lot of common apps available for ios and android that are not available for Windows.\n\nIt's SO frustrating that Microsoft does the complicated things rather well and completely misses the important details - like a good onscreen keyboard. They are almost the only ones who don't have a Swipe-like capability and good handwriting recognition. Really dumb, IMO.\n\nYou need to decide which factors are the most important."}

It is a great little yet powerful tablet. I use it for general browsing, skype, music, youtube and also playing games. I like the ability to access and play music from my desktop, use Picassa, Chrome and the skydrive synchronization. Build quality by Dell is pretty good. The screen is bright and audio very loud for the size. This tablet PC runs the full version of Windows 8.1 which is great as legacy applications are supported. Further Windows 8.1 made good improvements from its predecessor. Intel Baytrail processor is pretty fast and offers good battery life. Windows App store is decent. In addition I run Android apps using Bluestacks emulator. Haven't tried Miracast wireless streaming to TV yet but intend to get the Netgear PTV adapter. The tablet comes with one micro usb port and SD card slot. My suggestion for future improvement for Dell are to have 64GB as default and have 2 usb ports. Also provide recovery image in SD card and free up the disk space."}

It only has the one MicroUSB port so either you can charge or use peripherals (it doen't come with an adapter cable to use standard sized USB devices).\n2.  Windows 8.1 is not ready for the 8\" screen.\n3.  You NEED a keyboard/mouse to use this as a pc replacement in desktop mode.\n4.  If you charge this device while using it, the battery charge stays the same.  ie if you are at 25% battery and put the charger in you will stay at 25% battery, no matter how long you charge it.\n5.  In desktop mode touch screen is finnicky.  Sometimes it takes multiple presses before your input registers.\n6.  Lastly,my unit won't charge and it won't turn on.\n\nI bought 4 of these and all of them are going back, three aren't even opened.  Love the idea, but these 8\" Windows machines are just not ready yet...  I am going to wait for a Bay Trail Laptop with 4gb of memory, and none of these hardware issue...\n\nUPDATE:\nIf anyone is still in the air about getting this device. This has been the best video review I have seen of the device. Notice how the initial impressions are good, quality of screen, the sliding of the screens, etc... But then notice the little things that add up to frustration:\n1. Multiple taps to get things to happen in desktop mode.\n2. The dissimilar experience between desktop mode/Metro.\n3. The poor stylus performance.\n4. The biggest issue is that if you want to accomplish a task you can do it better with a dedicated tablet/notebook.\n\nAdd to this the inability to charge, and it just gets worse... Also the price is still dropping while other Windows 8 8\" tablets are holding their prices, a sure sign Dell is about to give up on this thing, but dumping the inventory. For comparison, I have the Dell 8\" Android version of this tablet, and its great. Affordable, SD card, I think the same great screen, so far very reliable.\n\n[...]"}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "Update:  After getting help from Dell about 9 days ago, and all seemingly ok after the drivers installed..I put the unit away again until after the holidays. Well, had the chance to get into it last night...along with my techie nephew.  The internet though it said was connected we were unable to get online.  He noticed the unit was hot..I didn't as I said it has always been like that.  We assumed it was because of the charging (adapter??) not getting all the way juiced..so we decided to plug in for a few hours since it sat recently.\n\nWell..I have a paperweight since it will not turn on at all now.  I purchased this unit at Walmart....I got the other one online for a bargain. I have not opened that one yet. I am returning this Walmart one and will maybe try one more time..in case I got a defective unit. One star for my unit..which is defective...\n\nI will also try the other unit and see...\n\nI am going to write a basic review..very basic and hope to revisit. To be honest, I did not need a tablet device...but I found this when looking for XMAS gifts for my daughter. I was looking for a budget/decent laptop (does that exist?).  I got turned onto this..but not for her but for my use!  Currently, in my business, we have MS Windows PC's...I use a MACbook Pro even with windows/office installed to keep it all seamless.  We have an Ipad which I hardly used..mostly because I have a hard time with the business side of things I still tend to jump on the laptop for 'work'. As far as the gift for the daughter, she currently uses my computer for word/internet research and other school projects...I wanted to get her off of mine and was opting for a cheap laptop w windows (bc of office); and then I was tooling around with chromebooks for her (for googledocs).\n\nAnyway, I had this brainstorm that really when I travel the only reason I take my whole laptop is because of the office on my pc..I need it.  I then did lots of research on this..and decided to either get her a cheap laptop or chrome; but that I would pick this  Dell PRo up for us to use as a family.  Eliminating the need to carry my pc. And, if the kid needed to use WORD for whatever reason, well we will just use this tablet..\n\nSo, I was lucky enough to get 2--I decided to buy one for my right hand person as well..since he is the one who uses windows/office day and night.  I got them both for $199 on that sale day.  I was looking forward to receiving the items.  I got the second at Walmart as they pricematched.\n\nAnyway, I finally opened it last night.  I will be the first to admit that I am not Windows 8 savy. WE have an older version of windows and all I use the office for is Word/ Excel/ Power point for the most part. Extensively.  I am not a Windows basher because I have MAC and am now quite fond of. I realize its limitations in some regards as well.\n\nNow, learning Windows 8  and then upgrading to 8.1 on a tablet is not the easiest..but I was confident.  I am having problems though to be honest. If some of you who are not overly experienced with Windows 8 think it will be seamless..it may not be.  I have had a hard time with the keyboad sometimes popping up for me to type unless I prompt it. It seems to be slowing down now but still.  The other problem I am having is..I have good eyes! I am 45 and don't have dr prescribed glasses yet..However, I do wear low level reading 'magnifiers' when using the PC.,..\n\nI am having the HARDEST time reading on this thing. I did some research and apparently it is a problem with some people and they were/are looking for a fix for that.  And lastly, today, it just froze. I actually could not get it to move and had to power it down via turning it off. I did try to turn it back on and now wireless difficulties. Not once since 2008 when I started using my MAC have I ever had any issues with my conputer. The ONE time I did it was with WINDOWS/Quickbooks on my MAC....It was a bit disappointing to be directed to 'fixes' upon opening the box..even worse forgetting how to deal with those fixes as quickly as I once did wihen I used Windows Full time. Also at some point I got an error something like \"secure boot is not completed\"...I forget but I have also seen some others get this error and had to 'fix' it...\n\nI am not giving up on it yet..as it can fill a need for me. I am going to try to get an expert to set it up for me and give me a brush up on windows..and then decide again....It is a sturdy unit and nice.  At this point I am going to give it 2 stars b/c of the glitches upon opening the box.  I I hope in a week or less to come back and give it 4 or 5 stating that I love it....because I see it does have potential.....\n\nAs a sidenote, I was also considering Asus T100 Transformer...but once I found this one I wanted this one to work....Hope so..."}

I love that device and truthfully I loved my Venue pro.  The only 2 problems are that 1 windows is so big on such a small drive that after installing and activating the free version of office I could no longer run the recovery option I needed to run when the 2nd problem manifested itself which was that the very first batch of windows updates rendered the Wi-Fi card inoperable.  The card always showed disabled even when enabling it from Network connections window.  The device itself showed the WiFi was functioning.  My technical level is about as high as it comes, this is a device/software flaw that I'm sure they'll fix soon, but novice IT buyers beware.  Before running out of space i choose the restore option of refreshing my PC but keeping my data.  But after the office install the free space is too limited.  If you restore the device to factory settings it restores operation of the Wi-Fi card but every time you allow windows update to run it kills it.  I thought it was a wifi card driver update, but it's not a device driver update that's causing the problem.  Or at least not an update I could see in the list before they were applied."}

The advantages of having a full desktop operating system on a tablet were greater than I imagined, and my other tablets are now collecting dust.\n\nMy only problems with it are - and others have said this too - is that there is only one USB connection which is also used for power, so you can't power and have other things connected, and there's no display out for easily connecting a monitor.  That being said, for basic tablet use, these don't really matter so much. But, because this tablet can do as much as it can, you want to do everything with it which is where those additional features would have been a welcome addition.\n\nOther notes:\n- I like the position of the start button on the side, and the fact that it's a physical button\n- I have found the location of the USB port sometimes awkward, especially being next to other buttons\n- Playing with the screen brightness, I noticed it can get so bright it hurts my eyes (that's good, right?)\n- Certain USB cables aren't powerful enough to charge the device; the packed charger is fine, but you might find others you have won't be up to the challenge"}

They both have desktop power for the kinds of windows tasks I use them for.  I have no problem at all with these decises.\n\nI prefer the 8\" devices when I am on the move. I have been using the Acer W3 for several months now and while the screen is not the best, it has been very functional for me.  I have used it for 3D printing, and as a ground station for some of my drones. I have been looking at a reasonable replacement in size and power to replace the W3, due to its poor display though.\n\nI ordered and received the Dell Venu Pro 8 and was very impressed with its IPS display.  It had more performance than the W3 and its loud speaker is a real winner for me. As for battery life, it all depends on what you are doing but it is only slightly better than the W3.  With its loud speaker I found myself using it to listen to all my podcasts and internet radio programs. Its crisp bright display also makes using the windows desktop easier as well.\nAll that said, the Dell falls short in a couple of areas when compared to the W3.\n1. The Dell Venu 8 Pro does not have an external video out for a displaying on a larger screen. Dell tries to get around this by claiming it has Miracast.  This is a big fail. Its problematic at best and in most cases does not work.\n2. The Dell Venu 8 Pro has only a single USB connector. This connector is used to charge the tablet and to connect external devices. Let me make this clear here: You cannot connect power to the Dell and use a USB device at the same time. One of the reasons I want a real windows tablet is so that I can run my legacy software and connect to various hardware devices.  I want to use it with my 3D printers and to control my drones.  As an example, I can connect the Dell to my 3D printer, but I need to disconnect the device and charge the tablet before moving to another part.\n\nFor the above reasons, the Dell Venu 8 Pro makes a very nice consumption device, much like my IPads, but the inability to run a USB device and power the unit is a show stopper."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "When you first get the Dell Venue 8 Pro, it will be updating the software every time you shut it down.  Do it, because it is really important.  The touch screen is really messed up until you do this.  Then after the software is all updated and I also played with the keyboard settings, then it is acceptable.  Although, I also own a few Kindle Fires and the touch screen on the Dell is not as slick as the Kindle.  The Dell is perfect when holding it, but if you set it down on a stand and try typing on it, you will likely end up with multiple types per touch here and there.\nEverything else about this tablet is just awesome.  Super fast doing anything.  In fact it is my fastest computer that I own.\nNow for the reason I bought this.  After seeing the youtube video turning it into a desktop pc using the Plugable UD-3000 docking station, I just had to have it.\nYou do need to be tech savvy to get that all working.  It took me 8 hours just to get everything working.  Now that I set it up, it is plug and play.  Plug it in, desktop computer.  Unplug it and it is a tablet.\nIf you just need to do surfing while sitting on your sofa, this Dell is over kill and maybe more complicated than necessary.  For this a Kindle Fire is perfect.  If you do more sophisticated tasks like photo editing software, movie editing, stock streamers or other window specific software, then the Dell Venue 8 Pro is the tablet for you.  On the other hand, if you love high tech toys like me and after seeing what this little thing is capable of on that youtube video, you just got to have it.  Good luck."}

The performance is outstanding, and the battery life is great. I've taken this on 4 hour plane rides to date, and watched movies the entire time but downloading the VUDU-ToGo app (a Windows Desktop app which can't be run in Windows RT), and it consumed approximately 60% battery during the flight.\n\nThe weight distribution is terrific, and the WiFi is very fast.  I got the 64GB model, and it's well worth the cost.\n\n***NOTE: Because this is essentially a regular Windows device, it is possible for you to really screw up power savings by doing things like: Installing other A/V solutions (the built-in Security Essentials is JUST fine), Domain Joining, Installing VPNs, etc... My point is, you can do that, but don't expect the same battery savings.  I do use this for work, but I use browser related access instead of native desktop apps.\n\nPersonally, this device really shines.  There are a few glitches here and there, and I'm sure Dell will update the BIOS.  Nothing worth complaining about.

Twice now the tablet has reset to the default settings requiring the password and broadcasting the voice. What am I supposed to do?

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "This review is going to be confusing so let me start with the worst and then get to the best. There is a SERIOUS issue with the WiFi at the moment. For reasons that cannot be determined the Wifi chip in the tablet dies and you have to restore a recovery to get it functioning again. With so little space on board (it says 32GB but that is misleading since the vast majority of that 32GB is used by the OS leaving you only about 9GB to play with) everything you'll do on this tablet revolves around WiFi. Whether its streaming from another computer or the web or using Skydrive you need a connection and having that break randomly is unacceptable.\n\nI've had it happen to me twice; once just an hour or so after opening the box and then a few days later. Its such a worry that I've fallen back on my old Android-custom-ROM-flashing habits and create a System Restore point before and after installing every update. The first time I had done very little configuration so I bit the bullet and restored the original backup. The second time I followed some instructions I found online and uninstalled all windows updates and rebooted.  If you are considering buying this tablet, the WiFi issue is something you NEED to be aware of.\n\nNow, putting aside the WiFi issue, this is a fantastic little device. This is my first tablet mostly because I just could not justify having a high-end smartphone, a laptop, a desktop AND a tablet. Most tablets to this point have seemed like a bigger smartphone - great portability but still saddled with the limitations of a mobile ecosystem. I'd been using a Nook Simple Touch for a while as an e-reader and only because the screen size on phones doesn't lend itself to reading very well but when that died just out of warranty I was SoL. I have a Windows Phone and there is no Nook app for that platform. I started looking at the tablet/e-reader market and initially ruled out the Nook HD+ simply because it doesn't seem to be getting much support lately and I don't want to buy into a dying ecosystem. The Kindle Fire HDX was a nice option but I have spent a decently large amount buying Nook books and the cost of the Kindle plus re-buying all my books (since kindle won't support nook books) brought it on par with a dedicated tablet like the iPad Air and if I were to spend that much it makes more sense to simply buy a dedicated tablet.\n\nAlso, out were Windows RT tablets. They're plagued with the same issue as my WinPhone; a massive lack of support. I hadn't yet heard of the new full Windows tablets so I simply focused on the iPad Mini with Retina Display and the Google Nexus 7.  In the end, both have the same limitations as I mentioned earlier: They're big phones without a cell radio. My sister's husband (a Microsoft employee) told me to check out the Dell Venue 8 Pro and I was initially skeptical. In terms of mobile devices, Dell just doesn't have the reputation of LG, Apple, Samsung, or Google but I did my due diligence and checked one out at the Microsoft Store.\n\nEnough of the tale, let me get into why this tablet (aside from the WiFi issue) is the best available: Its not a silly toy. iPads look great but you pay so much for the name. Android is huge and wonderfully open but updates are slow and I've had issues in the past with reliability (Samsung Epic 4G GPS Radio was bad, massive amounts of bloatware, the silly user interfaces, etc). In the end, both of them rely on their massive phone app catalogues to function. A lot of those apps are great but they are all neutered versions of their full counterparts. The ability to run Metro Apps is similar but mated to that is the ability to run full Windows Apps. Now, an 8\" screen is not the best idea if you're intending to use it as a laptop replacement; its simply too small. Then again, I feel silly having to run and grab a laptop to do basic things like reading or checking news and if while I'm using the tablet I need to do something a little more involved, I can without having to go to the desktop or the laptop. This new generation of Windows Tablets running full Windows on Bay Trail chips is the tablet as it should always have been.\n\nOne of the big things that made me stop and think was the screen resolution: Compared to other tablets the resolution of the Dell is theoretically terrible. If this is one of your worries, I urge you to go take a look at one. This screen is GORGEOUS. There is no pixelation, text is clear and crisp, and its a fantastic display. Dell hit a home run with it. The only downside is that the auto-brightness seems to be a bit too aggressive and tends to dim the screen too much. Turning it off and simply running at a mid-range brightness is fine but you'll notice a hit to battery life. Nothing catastrophic but its something Dell should definitely take a look at.\n\nSound quality is by far the best of any mobile device I've seen yet. I have a nice pair of Sennheiser earbuds that I typically use whenever listening or watching anything on a mobile device and I haven't plugged them in yet because the built in speaker is so clear and crisp. Another home run. In terms of speed, this thing is fast as lightning. I haven't seen a single slow load and the boot time is surprising.\n\nSo to sum up here are the pros and cons:\n\n*Pros\n-Amazing Speed\n-Full Windows with Office included\n-Beautiful Screen\n-Tremendous Sound\n-Decent battery life\n-Windows 8.1 has come a long way from the oft-maligned original 8 and is actually a wonderful platform\n\n*Cons\n-The WiFi issues are a huge deal breaker\n-Screen Auto-Brightness needs to be fixed\n-Listing the tablet as a 32 GB Tablet is misleading since you'll only have access to about 9 GB of that space\n-Not being able to charge the Tablet while also using the micro-USB port to attach devices is a pain\n-No video out other than the micro-USB\n-The decision to place the Windows key on the top of the device (where there would normally be a power button) was an odd one that takes getting used to\n\n*Overall\nIf you are willing to deal with a bit of hassle and hope that Dell will fix the WiFi issue and hopefully the auto-brightness as well, then this is a perfect tablet. It does what its supposed to and does it fantastically. It has its foibles, but so does every device. If and when the WiFi issue gets fixed I will update this rating to a 5star."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "The Windows 8 tablet interface isn't intuitive--I find that I need to google how to do everything. The \"windows button\" is on the top edge of the device and isn't as accessible or convenient as many would like.\n\nMS clearly wants to keep us within their eco-space--changing from IE or Bing prompts Significant additional changes that negatively impact the usefulness of this device.\n\nThe UI learning curve prevents me from using the device to any significant degree at this point--there are prompts that offer assistance in learning the new interface at startup but they haven't been helpful in a significant fashion. It appears that Youtube/Google are your best friends right now for a windows 8 tablet.\n\n***Update 12/18/13***\nOk, so I've had it for a couple weeks and I'm still underwhelmed. It's unfortunate that I can't separate the Windows 8 software from the device, but the fact is, we're buying a device and the two are inseparable. I've not yet been able to do anything of significance using this.\n\nI bought the device primarily so I could read and comment on MS Word docs while waiting to pick up kids after their different activities. I've tried iOS and Android devices with no success. At least the Dell has Word. I've run into some clear problems in using the device however.\n\nFirst, you need to use the onscreen keyboard (OSK) to input data. I tried using a stylus, but there's no reasonably useful character recognition software that I've been able to find. The native Windows writing recognition is, to be kind, absolutely useless. It only occasionally picks up a stylus when writing. The problem then is that the OSK takes up half the screen in landscape mode. In portrait mode it's smaller, but so is the text--I can't read it 'cause it's so small. Yes, I could get a larger tablet but it would be heavier. This is simply an observation, so don't flame me--suggestions on how to avoid this problem will be appreciated, but my hope was that a tablet would have superb handwriting recognition--like my Palm with graffiti did... (boy am I old!)\n\nSecond, I've only been using the device for two weeks and I was unable to connect to any networks a few days ago due to an internal device problem--as reported by the device. The help function required that I go online---uh... how? So, there's an option to reset the device to factory specs--it worked, but all settings were lost and the device needed to be reconfigured. I don't know if this is a Dell or Microsoft problem but it doesn't much matter to me---my experience with this device is underwhelming.\n\nFinally, the UI is not intuitive. Much of what I've learned from years of Windows usage is not useful. One of the least endearing features is the onscreen help--  ***and this is important***  --which cannot be dismissed. These honkin' large help messages obscure parts of the screen and make it impossible to see what's behind them--and the only thing you can do is wait until they disappear--which requires being patient and doing nothing for awhile. I could go on about the UI but there's no need. Just read this (if amazon allows the link to work): [...]\n\nOverall, I'm keeping the device, as I expect I'll need to learn Win8 sooner or later and this is a non-critical device for me. However, I'm disappointed that I can't do much more with it than check e-mail."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "PROS: Delivery was very fast on this tablet. It is quick to start up and has a great screen resolution. It's very sharp and clear. It has a some apps for it and also has Microsoft office which in it self is worth about $150.00. I think as time goes on you will find more apps. One thing I want to share with everyone is you don't have to just buy dell add-ons. Do a little research and you will find that their are cheaper brands that work just as good as dell's and cost less. Example being bluetooth keyboard and bluetooth mouse. You can find substitutes on line with a little research. Just google \"substitute bluetooth addons for dell venue 8 pro\". Also check out any forums you can find. They are a great source because these people already own one.\n\nCons: Dell in it self is the biggest con. Let me explain. I ordered some items to go with the tablet and after the 3rd delay I decided to cancel the orders. Dell apologized and said they would credit back my credit card, that has been over a week ago. They are very good at telling you what you want to hear. So in closing Dell not only can't deliver on their orders but take their sweet time giving you your money back. So remember Dell venue 8 Pro with Windows 8.1 is a great unit but you would be better off ordering add-ons from someone else. Looking online for hints and tips are few, I have been looking for sometime now."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I received a refurbished unit only a few days after calling DELL re: unchargable unit due to micro USB port issues. This is a huge hardware flaw which is reason enough to not recommend this.  If I do not sell or give this away, I believe no matter how careful I am, ordinary use of the Venue 8 Pro will cause irreparable damage to the USB port.\n\nThe wifi drivers issue may be present with ALL Win 8/ 8.1 tablet; am confused if it is an issue due to Intel or Microsoft's driver, whatever. We must all beware of this.  When I had the wifi loss on the Venue 8 Pro i did an entire restore and new set up.  I have a new SONY Vaio Tap 11 which lost wifi connectivity also, after some of the updates [not sure which one caused this...] , so using the only Win restore point corrected it. So I do not count this as a DELL issue.\n\nAnother issue with any new pc is Win 8 set up..if one enters a typo in your email to register, you will NOT get the code MS sends to complete registration and will locked out of using the machine, unable to get back in when necessary..leading to full restoral and new set-up. I had this problem too, early on in the first set-up.\n\nOtherwise, I was resigned to the Venue 8 Pro lack of connectivity and the small desktop. That is an individual choice for anyone considering an 8 in. Win 8 PC/ tablet. Again, beware of Win 8/8.1 issues and look for a competitor's 8 in Win 8.1 tab or perhaps wait it out an updated model. But thanks anyway, DELL for trying to make it right."}

No major abrasions. All I could find was a small scuff and indention to the plastic. I was soo happy since I was still just getting used to this thing and rely on using it for my training video's I watch during my bus ride to work daily. So how does it do as a tablet?\n\nIts exceeding my expectations for the price range. I've tried the iPads, Kindle, and numerous Android devices but NONE of them gave me what I wanted out of a tablet, which was a laptop replacement. I was amazed at the speed of this device as its almost up-to-pace with my laptop which has nearly double the spec's. I can run my Office programs, Chrome browser, and my Android emulator (Blue Stacks) at the same time without grinding this thing to a halt. I can even use TeamViewer or LogMeIn to remote into my other PC's and servers which means I can truly put away my laptop! As an IT nerd I think I have finally found a tablet that has the power I need, but will fit in a (large) pocket, rather than toting my messenger bag everywhere while on-call.\nThe only thing missing is a keyboard...\n\nUpdate: I've ordered the Dell Keyboard / Cover and Stylus.

So when I saw the Dell and at it's price I picked it up.  I love that it is Windows based because that's what I use on my work and personal PCs.  There aren't yet nearly as many apps as are available for Apple, but I found that after having my iPad and iPhone for years I really don't use that many apps and the Dell does have everything I need.\nFor me the most frustrating thing is the size of the screen - it is small and hard to read a web page without constantly expanding the size, but that would be the same for all similarly sized tablets.  I definitely think a stylus is the way to go, it really helps when navigating around the smaller screen.

It's flaky and even after the latest updates, it doesn't work exactly right. In addition, when using a second monitor the colors are reduced (when compared to a direct HDMI connection  - I compared this to a Toshiba Encore with a micro HDMI - huge difference). In addition, video is very choppy when playing anything besides a low resolution youtube video over miracast. The Toshiba encore has it's own flaws that are even worse than the video issue with Dell. Dell needs to get micro HDMI on these 8\" tablets. Miracast is a joke at best. Besides, why should I have to buy an $60 additional device just to hook up another monitor. I purchased the Netgear Push2Tv product. Now, I need to deal with two vendors with their own firmware issues.... nonsense.\n\nOk, besides that issue, the Dell is AWESOME. If you don't need a second monitor, this is the Windows tablet to get. It is very light and thin. The construction is great and feels of high quality. Most everything works well.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "Wifi interferes with and will even kill bluetooth on this device.  It is especially noticeable when using an application like Microsoft's free program \"Mouse without borders\" which enables you to control this tablet from your desktop pc's mouse and keyboard.  There is significant lag in the mouse control which completely vanished the second bluetooth was disabled.  Transfering files over wifi while streaming bluetooth audio caused wifi to completely crash out in one instance.  You can hear stuttering and static on bluetooth audio when using wifi.  So listening to youtube over bluetooth while loading content over wifi is not so good, and the speaker isn't that great on this device....\n\nOtherwise this little machine is very excellent.  I can't wait till we have windows phones with full windows.  This tablet shows its not impossible nor too far off.\n\nI only wish that this tablet had many of the more excellent features that android devices have.  Its missing: gps, accelerometry, high pixel density and full hd resolution, hdmi out, fast charging, and nfc.  Other than that, hey... but then it would cost $600.  These x86 microtablets aren't as far into development as the arm based stuff.  It'll get there eventually.  It is really snappy and battery life is amazing.  Its thin and a good size to hold.  The edges are a bit square and unpleasantish, but thats being picky.  Its good that you can keep hold of it.  The rubberized backing is nice for this as well.  I imagine if Samsung implements this processor in the next note 8 it will be a mega hit.  Android will scream on this processor.  Intel is offering these chipsets at very competitive price points and it's exactly what the mobile device market needs to shake things up.\n\nI immediately disabled hibernation and got rid of the hibernate file and disabled and rid the system paging file.  Gained a couple GBs back from the os.  That stuff has been worthless for so long, I wish they would stop with it.  Next to my older windows 8 tablet I can use a bluetooth mouse and keyboard and have a mini-dual monitor setup.  Perfect!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I've used different family members tablets (iPads really) over the years and never really could see the point of having them when they just seemed like a bigger version of a phone. A couple of weeks ago I decided to give in and purchase a Dell Venue 8 32 GB Android tablet as an alternative to toting around my Dell Inspiron 17r laptop. I love my Dell laptop, especially after having a couple HP/Compaq laptops in the past  that were duds with different issues, so staying with Dell made sense and the table was only $159.\n\nWhen I received the Dell Venue 8 Android Tablet I really liked the look of it. The textured rubber back made it easy to hold and added a sleek look to the black tablet. The 8-inch screen I felt was the perfect size for both eye comfort and holding. When turning on the tablet and setting it up like you do with all Android products, I found the tablet to run very fast due to its Intel processor and 2 gigs of RAM. The downside was that the battery life only seemed to last a few hours with moderate amount of usage. As I continued to move my way around the tablet I realized that it was exactly like using my Samsung Galaxy SIII which I have 4G and not just wifi. So after looking at the reviews for the Dell Venue 8 Pro 64 GB (Windows 8.1) I decided to return the Android version and get the windows. Best choice I ever made!\n\nJust to touch on a few things:\n\nHaving a full version of Windows at my fingertips is extremely convenient. I can quickly flip open my tablet case, turn on the tablet (or wake from sleep mode) and go to an app. I am a Windows 7 lover and have all my programs that I need set up how I want, so it is a little challenging learning this new OS which is so completely different from its predecessor.\n\nThe design of the Pro tablet is pretty much the same as the Android, except the front camera is located on the right side as opposed to the middle, and the texture of the back of the tablet is a little different. The Windows button located on the top of the tablet allows you to return to the Start area no matter what you're in (which is helpful to the Win8 newbies). The speaker gets pretty loud if there is no background noise, but if there is noise that's what headphones are for. Oh and love, love, love the length of the battery life! It lasts longer than my laptop and that is with high level of usage and video streaming.\n\nThe only cons I would see is that it doesn't have an HDMI or display port, and the texts and apps are small. Also the 5.0 mp camera is not so good, but no one buys tablets for their camera abilities. That what smartphones are for. So the Dell Venue 8 Pro might not be a replacement to the Windows laptop PC but it sure is  a convenient supplement."}

The iPad I have runs on iOS 7, but I can't run some Windows programs I need, which forced me to a Windows laptop for portability for those programs.  Then comes along this Dell Venue 8 Pro with the full Windows 8.1 OS version built in, a great screen, and boots up quick, and works really well.\n\nSo I loaded those Windows program from my laptop onto this tablet, and they all work great.  It's a small, light, fast laptop in a thin tablet.  Dell did a great job on this and the price is right.  If only Apple would now put their full Mac OS into the iPad.  You can't go wrong with this Dell product."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I got this tablet from Dell.com. This computer is by far the best implementation of the idealized concept of a single computing device for all - the perfect marriage of a content consumption tablet and a light/heavy work machine. For content consumption, it comes with all the major apps that you need. The games selection may not be as wide as iOS or Android, but I suspect that the eventual unification of Xbox and Windows will change that.\n\nThe speed, display and touchscreen performance are absolutely top notch. This is not a toy like Nexus or iPad which are meant only for content consumption, games and light email. This little beauty can do all that too but it is also a FULL FLEDGED workhorse computer running the powerful windows 8.1 OS. For light content creation, this hooks up nicely to a Bluetooth mobile keyboard and mouse for short term work. And the nice stylus for taking quick notes is a plus. However, I'm eagerly awaiting a custom keyboard for this tablet to be released by Dell...their website frustratingly says 'coming soon'. For long term, heavy duty work use, you can hook it up to a larger monitor using a USB OTG cable and you're all set to use it as your main office PC.\n\nI had given up on Dell as a serious PC maker, but this device has surely brought them back into the game."}

Dell installed Windows 8.1 as if it was on a full scale PC with no consideration to Fonts sizing. The keyboard does not pop when it should. You have to call it and it covers the area  where you are supposed to write; closing it is as tedious as opening it.\nIf you venture calling Dell support GOOD LUCK. NO one there has heard about the Venue 8 Pro.\nIts regretful because the tablet hardware is good and Windows 8.1 is great."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I bought this tablet from Costco after reading all the great reviews on multiple websites. After having used it for a few days, I can't help but feel that this tablet does everything you ask of it, but doesn't necessarily do them as well as I'd want it to. I own a Windows Phone for the last one year, and the transition to the phone from iPhone wasn't a difficult one. This transition from the iPad will probably not be an easy one if I do make the transition.\nFirst let me focus on the positives...\n1. The operating system when in the Modern Metro UI is absolutely great. It looks good, feels easy to operate and allows for things that competing Operating system's don't provide. Couple of examples: I love the ability to pin things on the start screen to allow quick access; absolutely love that I can have two windows open side by side. I've always missed that feature in tablets, and the Dell Venue Pro does it really well. Also love the picture password.\n2. Something has to be said about the hardware. I am not a huge Dell fan, but this tablet feels great in the hand. Doesn't slip and is comfortable to use. The screen is also nice, provided you turn off the automatic brightness that is the default setting.\n3. Internet Explorer: I actually like IE. They have optimized it for touch and it looks and feels great.\n\nNow for the things I don't like that much; or things that make me feel that this tablet is good at everything, but not the best at anything.\nApp gap: Its no secret that Windows tablets have an app gap when compared to their iOS and Android siblings. That situation is improving as I have witnessed on my window phone for the past year. Having said that, if apps are important to you, this tablet is not for you; at least not yet. The argument I've heard often is that this is a PC, so you can always run the desktop apps. That's true that this is a PC, but desktop apps without a mouse/keyboard did not make for a good user experience for me. As an example, I tried to use Spotify. To first login, I had to press a button to make the on-screen keyboard show up. Then it covered half my screen, including the text box into which I was typing, then I had to hit the 'x' to hide the keyboard. I had to repeat the same procedure to enter my password. Once I did that, navigating that desktop app using my finger was not as easy as it is using a mouse. In a nutshell, desktop apps on a tablet without a keyboard mouse did not replace the native apps I have used on my fruit branded tablet.\n\nNote taking: The tablet uses an active stylus which is supposed to be a lot better than the regular styli. But its been a disaster so far. Once again, the functionality is 'almost there'. Dell did issue a firmware update but that's didn't help matters much;  and now as per their forums, they may be introducing a new stylus that would work better. But it's not out yet, so there's no way to tell if the note taking experience will improve or not. I got the Dell over the Lenovo Miix because of the Stylus tech, but now I don't know if I should wait so this tech gets fixed or return the tablet so I am saved some money for now.\n\nMS office: The tablet comes packaged with MS office. That's a huge deal. But then again, if I had to do any serious work, I needed a keyboard/mouse. So while the tablet has the ability to use MS office, its not the best experience; not better than my windows 7 PC\n\nApple TV vs Chromsecast vs Miracast: I have a 5 year old son who loves to watch his lego reviews on youtube. So I usually start the video on my iPad and project it on the TV using Apple TV. That works flawlessly most of the times. I believe Chromecast does the same, but I am not sure. Miracast for Windows tablet has the same ability, but is laggy for me.\n\nIn conclusion, my take is that before you buy this tablet, determine what you need it for. If this is going to be your primary source of work, then consider getting a keyboard. A keyboard will be great for some serious work. If you want lots of apps and games, go with iOS or Android while the app gap on Windows is being narrowed."}

Part of the problem is that Windows 8 doesn't scale itself very well for such a small screen. However I have constant issues trying to hit little tiny x buttons to close windows. This is a real issue since Dell still hasn't gotten the stylus right.\n\nSometimes the screen takes a while to respond to touch. Then of late it has started shutting off instead of going to sleep.\n\nI haven't decided if I am going to keep it or send it back. I prefer my Nexus 7 (2013) by a long shot. I've been in IT for 18 years and I've worked with a lot of tablets including Windows 8. This tablet is an improvement over previous Dell tablets, but it's no where near the Surface Pro. It's also a fraction of the cost though.\n\nIf I keep it, I will update my review after I've used it for longer."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "Great little inexpensive tablet (got mine for about $229).  I think the tablet is almost as powerful as the circa 2009 Slimline Dell PC that I use at work but I can fit this in my coat pocket.\n\nAbsolutely love the fact that it runs full windows 8.1 (32-bit) and comes with M$ Office.  You just type in the product key and wait for the updates.  It easily paired with my wireless all-in-one printer for full print, fax and scan functions from the tablet.  You only get a little over 9GB of HD space free on the unit but I installed a Class 10 64GB microSD card for storage purposes.\n\nBuilt quality is a bit lacking because the body is made of lightweight plastic (I'm used to my iPad3) and there were some minor glitches like the touch keyboard doubling up letters or link buttons on websites not working when pressed. But many of those minor issues are easily fixed with updates from Dell Support.  Battery life isn't too great if you are on wifi but the unit recharges quickly.  Much faster to full recharge than my iPad.\n\nAnother surprising bonus is that Dell's limited warranty on my tablet is good until mid-2015.  I'll probably be using the Venue 8 Pro 2 before then.\n\nHopefully the keyboard cover will be released soon.  Not sure I'll get the active stylus unless they really improve it.  There really isn't any accessories for the tablet at this moment.\n\n*** Update 03/01/2014\n\nStill using my Dell 8 Pro on a daily basis.  I did get the bluetooth keyboard/case combo which is expensive but works well with the unit.  Combined with my wireless mouse, I can actually do work on MS Office.\n\nI did have to get a silicon band to hold them together when I'm traveling.  I think the Microsoft Surface has the best keyboard/cover combo and wish Dell made something similar.\n\nCons:  Touchscreen is still quirky even after the firmware upgrades.  Sometimes I get no response when I press something or if I am on the web it will only zoom when I touch upon something instead of activating a link or closing a window.  Letters get doubled or even tripled when I use the touchscreen keyboard.  It's not bad and does not happen all the time but can get annoying when it does.  And time you would normally right click on something is a struggle with trying get the same results on a touchscreen and no mouse.\n\nFor some reason my warranty was shortened.  Originally it expired in 05/2015 now it's 03/2015; so it was shortened by a couple months without explanation.\n\nI would still recommend the tablet if you can find 64GB version on sale; the storage on the 32GB version gets used quick.  But tablet does have its shortcomings and quirks."}

It's fast and the 8 inch size is very good for me.\n\nHowever, after I updated all the BIOS, firmware and drivers and used it for a couple of days, I found many problems.\n\nFirstly, after the tablet goes to sleep, when you tries to press the power button to bring it on, sometimes it doesn't respond, sometimes it just reboot itself. When it indeed wakes up, most of the time I found the wifi is disconnected (red cross on wifi icon). Toggle the wifi on and off doesn't work, toggle airplane mode doesn't work either. The only way to bring wireless back is to restart the device.\n\nNow I have searched this on the web for a while and many people have the same issue (check out tabletpcreview forums). Some people uninstalled some Microsoft updates to fix the problem, but it doesn't work for me.\n\nI'm sure it's a software/driver issue and I really hope Dell can release some updates/fix/patch whatever before I return it. It was clear that Dell was in a rush to put the device to market before they fully tested it.\n\nBTW, I have several other tablets (nexus 7 and surface RT). The surface RT doesn't have any of these issues.\n\nUpdate: 1. Your normal charger won't charge the DELL venue 8 pro even if it has more than 2A output. This will be very annoying for some people as you need to bring your DELL charger with you.\n\n2. DELL released new BIOS update A04 to fix the restart problem when waking up from sleep. The black screen issue was better described as bland screen issue actually. When you press on the power button to wake it up, the back light is on, only that the graphic driver is not showing anything on the screen. I will see if the newest BIOS fixed the problem.\n\n3. The wifi issue is still there, and I dug it a bit further and found in event viewer the following:\n\nSource:  Microsoft-Windows-NDIS\nDate:  12/11/2013 10:01:39 AM\nEvent ID:  10317\nTask Category: PnP\nLevel:  Error\nKeywords:  (16384),(16),(4),(2)\nUser:  SYSTEM\nComputer:  venue8\nDescription:\nMiniport Dell Wireless 1538 802.11 a/g/n Adapter, {2ad44b8a-5e5a-4011-8f75-4417b5aa1eea}, had event Fatal error: The miniport has failed a power transition to operational power\n\nThis seems to be an issue related to waking up after sleep to turn wifi on."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "Update 2: Short comparison between Asus T100 and Dell Venue 8 Pro\n\nSo I also bought an Asus T100 for a close member of my family and I can use it any time I want. I know many people are cross-shopping these two tablets.\n\nBuild quality is significantly higher on the Dell Venue 8 Pro, but the Asus T100 feels very good too, especially for the price. The T100 screen glass feels like plastic instead of glass initially, the screen surface feels hard to glide figers on. But it becomes useable after some time, after some finger grease settles on it. I think it is missing some special coating specific to high-quality touch screens.\n\nThe T100 has some significant shortcomings (besides its obvious advantages): battery drains much faster at idle/sleep, even after flashing the latest 220 BIOS and the latest Windows and Asus updates. This happens especially when docked to the keyboard. While the Dell Venue 8 Pro can stay in connected stand-by for like 5-7 days, the Asus T100 drains in 24 hours if docked or ~2 days if removed from dock. It also drains much faster with usage. Something is wrong with the T100 battery life at this time, hopefully it's fixable via some updates, but I am afraid it may have something to do with hardware too. The charging time is quite slow too, making you keep the laptop with the charger connected most of the time.\n\nKeyboard on the T100 feels very good, keys are a tiny bit smaller than on the previous \"netbooks\" but insigificantly so. You get used to them and become productive in 1-2 days. Much better than a touch screen keyboard. Trackpad is as good as any notebook trackpad but only after you uninstall the Asus SmartGestures software and flash the 220 BIOS.\n\nThe Asus T100 docking mechanism is very good and stable, with one shortcoming of a too narrow maximum screen tilting angle. Sometimes you wish you could tilt the screen more.\n\nAll in all, if the T100 fixes its battery and stand-by problems it's a near perfect convertible tablet/laptop. But right now I cannot fully recommend it, and instead I would recommend the Venue 8 Pro with the official wireless keyboard case (unless you absolutely need a larger screen).\n\nUpdate 1: the official Dell keyboard case for Venue 8 Pro can finally be ordered from Dell, and it looks quite good with a polycarbonate case that also includes a stand (like the Microsoft Surface models). However, the price is quite steep at $99. Although on the tablet page the keyboard is listed as \"coming soon\", just search Dell web site for either \"Dell Wireless Keyboard\" or \"460-BBHL\" which is the product code for the keyboard case. Can't wait to receive mine :)\n\nNow the original review:\n\nTo get you an idea of how much I wanted this tablet: I am from Europe, but Dell Venue 8 Pro is not available in my country (it will probably be available in 3-5 months at 1.5-2x the US price, as usual). So I used a package forwarding company and bought the tablet directly from Amazon US. Nevertheless, the tablet was in my hand in 3 days, thanks to Amazon Prime (trial) and a very fast service from the package forwarding company.\n\nI am a software developer at core. Even if today I have a higher position in hierarchy, I am still passionate about writing software. Since a very long time ago I secretly wanted a tablet that runs full Windows and can (when no other solution available) be used to develop/fix software and even deliver it to customers. I always thought that Windows has the power to be a 2-in-1 operating system (power both desktops and tablets), and Windows 8.1 achieves this seemingly impossible goal.\n\nI just hate how the Android and iOS tablets are really crippled when it comes to doing actual work. You can browse the web, read some books, watch movies with them, but that's about it. For many economy areas, the web technology is still quite slow and underdeveloped to allow you to really be productive \"in the cloud\". The 28 years of Windows productivity just can't be replaced by 6 years of (Android/iOS) OS  development centered around generating advertising revenue from content consumption.\n\nOk, so now back to the Dell Venue 8 Pro.\n\nBuild quality is impressive. Tablet feels very solid and non-flexible. What could be improved is the bezel around the LCD screen. It has a couple of extra plastic edges which somewhat lower the high-quality feel of the tablet.\n\nThe screen of the tablet is a bit warm color-wise upon first start, but quite bright if you disable the automatic brightness adjustment. The whites have a yellowish tint, which usually happens due to either intentional color calibration, or the glue bonding the TFT layers which will dry and whiten in a few days of use. This also happened on some iPhones and some Nexus devices some time ago, generating quite a lot of buzz. However, my Nexus 4 and Nexus 7 remained with the yellow-ish tint even after some use, so I am not expecting the Dell to gain really white whites but it may just be. I find the screen size absolutely perfect for tablet use. However regular desktop-mode use requires a larger screen, but it can absolutely be used without problems when needed.\n\nThe resolution of 1280x800 is sufficient, but pixels can easily be seen. A full-HD resolution would really benefit this tablet. But we have to think about the price, which is really low for such functionality. And also, Windows 8.1 is not ready for such high pixel densities, some work still needs to be done.\n\nThe storage system (which uses a cost-efficient eMMC interface) is faster than a traditional mechanical hard-disk especially at seeking (random accessing) times, but significantly slower than a full-blown SSD. However it is very well matched to the rest of the hardware, everything loads quite quickly. Software installation does suffer in speed compared to a SSD, basically software installs 2+ times slower than a SSD.\n\nProcessor speed is quite adequate for this tablet, about 3 times faster than previous netbooks, but also 2.5 times slower than the slowest Haswell Celeron desktop processor. Web pages load quickly enough and most web sites are very fluid, but the graphical system plays a role here as well. In fact, web browsing is faster than any Android or iPad tablet I have owned (up to iPad 3).\n\nThe installed 2GB of RAM memory is quite adequate and about perfect for productivity tasks (less for games). However when I tried to process a RAW picture from my camera in Adobe Lightroom and then export it, I got an \"out of memory\" error and could only export the picture without applying a final amount of sharpening. I do think that 2GB should be enough this can be remedied, maybe the paged file (extra memory that Windows allocates on disk when the 2GB are full) is disabled by default, I will have to investigate more. But the simple fact that I can run Lightroom on this tablet is amazing :) (update: problem solved on its own after a reboot).\n\nAbout the connectivity: the presence of only one USB port is crippling, but I immediately bought an OTG cable and a USB+SD card reader hub which works perfectly albeit with the added cable clumsiness. The only thing I wish was that the tablet could charge and use the USB hub at the same time. Due to some conflicting specifications on USB chargers vs. USB devices, you cannot charge and use the USB as a data port at the same time, even via a hub (there are some nasty tricks to do this but it's not simple).\n\nThe Micro-SD port is great and I will probably use it with a 64GB card, however almost all current microSD 32GB+ cards fail rather quickly (months) probably due to not mature enough miniaturization technology, and cannot be trusted with data that is not also replicated in the cloud via SkyDrive. Luckily, there is SkyDrive installed. So make sure that if you use a microSD card, the data on it is also synchronized in the clould.\n\nBattery life is very good, impressive for a full-Windows device. It lasts 8-10 hours with (my) normal use.\n\nAbout the software: to be honest, I like the Metro (touch) portion of the software more than the Android and iOS. It's just easier to browse, navigate, switch between apps, spell-check works better than any other OS. On almost all Android tablets and phones that I have owned there is a short but annoying delay from when I begin to swipe the finger on the screen until the page begins to scroll. That delay is absent here and this makes a tremendous difference. The only thing I miss is a Google Gmail application with push-email support. But this will probably never happen.\n\nIn summary, this is a great productivity tablet, the kind of tablet that you can take on a business or pleasure trip and never miss your laptop. Intel and Microsoft have a huge role in this, but I think Intel missed a few good years in which they could have done this new Atom processor and not keep people waiting so much on a power-efficient, full-Windows capable hardware. My prediction is that this combination of touch + desktop in a tablet will quickly lead to the decline of iPad / Android tablet sales in the next few years. We play, we socialize, but we must also work for a living and it's just easier and more productive to have one device for everything. Unless, of course, Apple follows suit and unifies OS X with iOS some years from now. Google is forced to keep developing web-based technologies, but the data transmission speed (speed of light) will always be a problem in making cloud-based applications as responsive as desktop applications."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "True iPad killer is here if you don't really enjoy Apple ecosystem. I stream movies and musics as files from my own server, without any DLNA or AirPlay in between, that so I get the full strength of everything. This is something only a Windows tablet could do.\n\nPros:\n\n- Powerful. It is a x86 CPU with two cores, with a decent graphic engine. I play COD 6 on it and it is smooth.\n\n- Light weight. Lighter than iPad, but more powerful. Heavier than some same sized Android pads, but a similarly powerful one never existed.\n\n- Good screen. The screen is of course not as decent as Retina. But for its size and general use on it, the resolution is high enough. Also the color is very good, bright and vivid. I've seen better on professional displays, but this is only a tablet. Except resolution, the screen is pretty much up to 1st Gen iPad Mini.\n\n- Long lasting. Unless you get to run a bunch of close-relative-of-computer-virus software on it, its battery lasts longer than 6 hours. That's 6 hours of time you have it turned on. I carry it with me all day and use it occasionally, and it lasts 2 days for me.\n\n- Full strength of Windows 8.1. Although haters are going to hate Windows, but for an average user, it means everything familiar is runnable on it. Productivity stuff like PowerPoint and Excel runs smoothly. Photoshop is running OK on it, only that the limited RAM size cause it to panic time to time.\n\n- Don't forget it is fundamentally a PC.\nYou can wipe the system and install Ubuntu. Or Android. It can virtualize an Android for sure. When did you see a tablet run another OS inside its own OS?\nYou can connect a lot of things to it, like an printer. You'll need a USB HOST cable to connect your old non-wireless printer that comes with a proprietary driver. No other kind of tablet else can, like a twice expensive iPad.\nAlso, although not for everyone, you can install Computrace (Computer LoJack) on it and worry less if you lost it. And more to it, it is Dell, that means your Computrace is not possibly be wiped out.\n\nAlright enough with all the sweet talking.\n\nCons:\n\n- Battery. Though this applies to every tablet. If you play a game on it you get much less battery life, like about less than 2. But it is the bottom line.\n\n- No MHL. You need an USB Video card to connect to external display, or a Mira supported wireless display adapter. None of them is cheap and decent at the same time.\n\n- Sound. The speaker is not too good. It is quite reasonable to expect no bass, because of its size. But there is popping sound and trembling when volume is high. It is better than most Android pad, but clearly no match with an iPad.\n\n- Cannot charge at the same time using USB OTG. Weird design, I wonder if it is fixable by BIOS update or driver update. However this only applies to you guys with a Y-cable which is physically possible to do so.\n\n- Stupid placement of physical start button and power button.\nPower button is too close to volume rocker, I make wrong moves all the time. Very annoying. And you don't get a delay trigger kind of power button (like on an ThinkPad, you press and hold for a very short while to trigger the button action), so it is quite easy to interrupt whatever you are doing when you try to move it. It is okay if you are doing Office. It is very not okay if you are skypeing with your friends.\nStart button is too isolated to everything. It is on top side (as the orientation is designed to be, because that side could be any side if you turn it around). I usually cannot find it at once without looking. Windows 8.1 is easy enough to perform such actions, why not just add some functionality buttons?\n\n- Structure design minor flaw. If you press the bottom side (again, the supposed to be bottom side) seam, it squeaks a little bit. I owned three of this (2 being gifts to my parents and friend), all three of them does this.\n\nWrap up:\n\nIf you are more comfortable with Windows, this is the smallest and yet decent thing running Windows 8.1. It is affordable but comes with amazing power. It runs smoothly just like your desktop. I could not be more strongly recommending this tablet to you.\n\nIf you are looking for a laptop / desktop replacement, you'd better go with Venue 11 Pro or Surface Pro (1 and 2). It's lack of expansions will make your life harder.\n\nIf you are an Android / iPad lover, consider this: I play COD6 on this tablet. If you don't like to use mouse, you could play Civilization. I play it too.\n\nIf you are swinging between this, Lenovo Miix 2, and Acer Iconia W3, here's my opinion (based on very limited knowledge): Miix 2 sucks in screen, Iconia W3 sucks in overall build quality.\n\nThank you for reading this."}

The snappiness is amazing - you will feel everything is zippy from the apps to browsing and since it runs Windows 8.1 (32-bit), a blue-tooth keyboard and mouse will turn this into a full fledged PC (even though the screen real estate is not that conducive - the option of converting tablet to PC is appealing). The form factor is perfect for holding with one hand or two. The feel of the tablet is sturdy. Dell does sell a Stylus (which I did not buy), but seem to have improved performance post-firmware update.\n\nThis is the number one go to device for me, for all the needs except for when I am coding etc. I do plan to buy the stylus and use it for more note-taking etc. The battery life is commendable - charges fast usually stays without a charge for about 8+ hrs."}

I say doubly disappointed because i had TWO tries at making this tablet work and both failed. When I got my FIRST tablet, it booted up, showed the Windows 8 screen. I went to the Dell site to download any updates and the included software. It threw me to a \"Registration\" screen. I checked the box saying I agreed to the contract and pressed the Register button, BUT NOTHING HAPPENED. The tablet did not freeze, I could go back to the Windows screen and open other programs. However, it would not accept any of my passwords on Outlook, or Skype. It apparently did not recognize that i was the \"owner,\" as I later found out. I called the Handy tech support number included inside the box. The first technician I spoke with took the information to register the tablet in my name. I was then transferred to tech support. At first, the gentleman I spoke with had trouble understanding the nature of the problem. Once he understood, he decide to take control of the tablet. He then spent the better part of an hour trying a number of things--which i could not understand--but nothing resolved the problem. Several time, he put me on hold to consult with others, but each time whatever he tried did not work. After being an hour and fifteen minutes on the phone, I had to go to work. He offered to call back at a convenient time, we agreed on a time. He never called back. I returned the tablet to Amazon and asked for a replacement.\n\nAmazingly, Amazon shipped a new tablet, which arrived within 24 hours. i was delighted.\n\nI turned on the replacement tablet and got the REGION AND LANGUAGE screen. I pressed NEXT to get to the next screen--NOTHING HAPPENED.  I tried to see if i could change the language or other information, but the touch screen was not responding. I turned it on and off several time only to get the same result. I once again called the number, got a gentleman who took the information to register my tablet and was passed on to tech support. Tech support thought he could solve the problem. We rebooted the tablet several times. He suggested rebooting pressing the volume control simultaneously with the power button. Nothing worked. He finally consulted with his supervisor who told him to tell me that I should return the table to AMAZON, which i am in the process of doing.\n\nI would love to have one that works, but can I trust DELL at this point, OR was I just doubly blessed this Xmas season???"}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "This is my third tablet; the first two were 1st and 2nd gen Kindle Fire. The main reason for buying this Venue 8 Pro is the full Win 8.1, meaning that I can run all of my desktop software. Specifically, I was actually looking for a really small laptop that can run Adobe Lightroom and MS Office suite. The Android and Apple tablet platforms don't offer me the option. I did considerable search before buying it and it has not let me down. The Atom Z3740 CPU is way faster than I expected. The 2GB memory is also more capable than I would have expected; may be Win 8 is that much more efficient than Win 7 that is running on my desktop. I have Bluetooth keyboard and mouse and 64GB microSD. It is a fully functional computer. The screen could be bigger but the size makes it easy to carry around.\n\nI like it enough that I could have given it a 5-star rating. Two things held me back: 1) no HDMI output; 2) tethered (wired & wireless) display can only operate in extended mode only and not duplicate mode. This really limits its usefulness in some situations. Not a deal breaker but I still do hope that Dell will address this problem soon. The Toshiba version does have HDMI output but there is virtually no review; so I was hesitant and did not go for that.\n\nFeb 9 2015 update\nI have this tablet for a while. I still like it but have since also bought a 10\" tablet with similar specs. I am using this Dell as a test bed for Windows 10. I had some minor issues during the installation process but easily solved. With Windows 10, it is snappier than Windows 8.1. I like the layout much better also. Still have not tried casting onto a second screen. I did a clean installation, I still have almost 20 GB (out of 32 GB) of storage left."}

This update was actually motivated by an action by Dell.  I had never bothered to return the original useless stylus I ordered with the tablet, or contacted Dell in any way, and just used it without.  Without prompting, last week I received a new model stylus to replace the original.  Bravo Dell.\n\nThe stylus is now perfectly functional.  Not quite up to the level of an S-Pen (wacom) but it does what a stylus should do as far as using it in OneNote.\n\nSince the early issues, the tablet has been stable and reliable.  I have been using in primarily as a mini-PC, on the desk with a keyboard and mouse. But it also works fine as a tablet; I even have no problems using Desktop Outlook with my finger.  And my eyesight isn't that great.\n\nThe screen brightness and contrast ratio is the best of any device I have used.\n\nScreen resolution is no issue for me on this small a tablet.  I have compared the Nexus 7 2013 and this tablet and there is no practical difference worth worrying about, at least for productivity tasks.\n\nI have moved it up to 4 stars, and replaced my initial negative experience with this update as I feel the product as it ships today no longer has the negative aspects that the \"first adopters\" like myself experienced.  Give me a version with 128GB and a wacom and you will have a 5-star product."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I bought the 32Gb for $227 during the Black Friday weekend, which was just an unresistable price for a tablet running full Windows 8.1 on an x86 processor. At first it felt very buggy. Certain apps would constantly crash when launching, some required \"repairs\", and some just wouldn't display correctly.  I ran the Windows 8 app troubleshooter which suggested the video card drivers were out of date, yet there were no newer drivers at the time.  Then on December 2nd, new \"Intel Platform\" drivers showed up on the Dell Support site.  After installing those, it would seem that all of my troubles are gone.  The \"Dell update\" software included on the device didn't find those updates, so be sure to go to the actual Dell Support website and download them.  There are other updated drivers, firmware, and BIOS software downloads there as well.  Install them all!\n\nI've been mostly using this as a bed/couch tablet while my Surface Pro is still the on-the-go work tablet, so I haven't installed any heavy desktop programs.  It does come with Office 2013 Home & Student edition, which includes the amazing OneNote 2013 so it may be worth it to get the pen just for that (which I have not done yet since it's sold separately).\n\nAs a couch tablet, the Dell Venue 8 works beautifully with Xbox SmartGlass as well as most of the Windows 8 apps in the store.  Halo Spartan Assault does not run properly at this time. It doesn't recognize/fit to the screen resolution properly. Hopefully an update to the game will fix that.  Fruit Ninja and Galactic Reign run pretty nicely though.\n\nIt's noticeably a bit slower than the Surface Pro, but obviously this is to be expected given the price difference.  Still it is extremely usable and acceptably fast.  I was surprised to see how easily I could browse RAW photos from my DSLR's camera memory card, and even Fhotoroom was able to edit those RAW images.\n\nGreat tablet, great form factor, great application ecosystem!"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "The almost perfect 8 inch Windows 8.1 experience.  I want to first say that I absolutely love this tablet.  The screen is 1200 x 800 but for an 8 inch tablet this is not an issue.  The tablet had the auto-brightness feature turned on by default which made the screen look a bit dim.  This can be turned off and then you can adjust the screen brightness to suit your preference.  Since the display is an IPS display the colors are vibrant.  Watching a Netflix program on the tablet looks great.\n\nThe first thing you will want to do with the tablet is download the newest BIOS and Firmware from Dell.  Dell makes this simple by using the installed DELL app.  Also I was pleasantly surprised to discover that once I registered the tablet my Warranty is good until June of 2015.  I was only expecting a year warranty.\n\nInstead of giving a run down of the system specs and benchmark results I will list why I decided on this tablet.  The need for a full Windows 8.1 tablet experience was what I desired.  Working as an IT System Administrator I wanted a tablet that would run all of my Windows Applications.  Windows 8.1 RT was not an option.  By being a full Windows 8.1 experience I can run all of my Desktop apps on this device.  With the inclusion of Office 2013 Home and Student all I need to do is install Outlook 2013 and connect it to my corporate network to enjoy a full featured Microsoft Exchange experience.  I do wish Outlook 2013 had been included with this out of the box but I can understand why it was not.  With the 64GB version I have more than enough storage.  Then adding an additional 64GB micro-SD card along with a network drive I do not see myself running out of storage.  By being a full Windows 8.1 experience you are not limited by what is available in the Microsoft App Store.  As I said earlier, if you are running a program on your desktop computer than you can run it on this tablet.\n\nThere are things to consider before buying.  The screen is small and if you have issues with seeing small fonts on your display then this will be an issue.  You will need a Blue Tooth Keyboard and Mouse to be able to use this in a productivity environment.  I have not purchased a stylus yet for it but I could see where that would help when running Desktop Applications.  Since the tablet does not have a kickstand a third party case with a kickstand is a necessity.\n\nEveryone who I have shown the tablet to have been impressed.  When I tell them the price which was $329 they become more interested since many of them have been looking at the IPADs and Android solutions which are available this season.\n\nI wish the tablet had stereo speakers instead of just having one speaker.  I wish it had a full sized USB port instead of the micro USB.  I wish it had a mini HDMI display port.  I wish it had a user friendly replaceable battery.  If those items had been included then I would have rated it five stars."}

Even after updating the BIOS and all drivers to the latest available, it will only connect if I re-install the Atheros driver but don't restart.  Once I reboot, I have to re-install it again to get it to connect to 5GHz APs.\n2) Windows boots to a black screen if you boot it up with the device in landscape mode.  After adding a password to my account, I could see that it actually happens after log in.  The screen is ON and the backlight is ON, but the screen is completely blank.  It registers touch input, but nothing is displayed.  Pressing the power button twice, which puts it to sleep and wakes it up, causes the screen to come back to life.  Booting Windows in Portrait mode results in no issues.\n3) Pressing the power button to put the computer to sleep and then waking it up within a minute or so results in Windows NOT prompting for your password.  This is a security risk as someone could pick up the tablet as soon as you put it down and have access to the device.  I am forced to press the Start and Power buttons at the same time, tapping Lock, then pressing power again to put it to sleep EVERY TIME I put this down.\n--UPDATE-- Found a Windows setting to force this to lock immediately  --UPDATE--\n4) Windows does not report the time remaining on the battery, only the percentage.\n5) The rear camera protrudes ever so slightly.  This means the device cannot truly sit flat and the glass cover over the camera is that much closer to being damaged by stray dirt or sand particles.\n6) The Dell recovery software started up in Portrait mode, so you are flying blind when choosing some of the options.  Luckily, I was able to simply press Next about 5 times and it restored the device to the factory image.\n\nBeyond the above issues, I do feel that the value of this device is great, considering that it is a full-blown computer with a full copy of Windows (not RT).\n\nI find it VERY interesting that the cost of this device is basically the same amount that I would need to pay to purchase Windows 8 and Office 2013.  Clearly, Microsoft is offering Dell the software for free to boost sales."}

I was skeptical if I would have a use for a tablet when I have a laptop + 4x PC's in my house.  I remember a time when tablets first came out and failed several years before ipads.  I don't think there is a tablet out there that can satisfy power users like myself.\n\nI didn't want an ipod or android tablet because I didn't want to be a slave or nickel & dimed to their app stores.  The MS apps are a bit limited but sufficient.  I don't care about apps like \"beating up a teddy bear\" or \"make fart noises\" apps.  I wanted real productivity - MS Office, PDF viewing (and writing), Photoshop editing, writing C code and compiling, write SQL queries via command prompt, access my NAS video collection.  I already own most of the software on my home PC, so I don't want to have to buy an app for something I already own, nor do I want a limited version that is not as powerful as the full software.\n\nFull Win 8, expandable storage (SD card), good price compared to ipads and most android tablets, and that was what pushed me to purchase this.\n\nThe screen is beautiful, unfortunately, mine has a little hot spot, so it has to be exchanged immediately, but if it wasn't for that, quality is excellent.  Maybe dell's quality control is not so great for letting this one get by.\n\nSpeeds seem great, took a few mins to get started the first time and update. Takes about 15-20 seconds to boot up from a cold start.  I have an i5 laptop that is about 3 years old and this tablet is fast enough.\n\nMy first hour impression is ok but not great and one of the first things I did was watch an embedded putlocker video.  I immediately installed Chrome since I couldn't stand the popups and ads on IE.  But Chrome doesn't let me resize all webpages and it's very hard (almost impossible) to click on individual links or close/open new tabs.  It was nearly impossible to be able to select the full screen video option.  And when it finally worked, it minimizes that fullscreen video out of view and I had no clue how to bring that video to the foreground.  This could be me not reading the manual and immediately trying to use it, so I will try to remember to report back if I can get this all working.  Getting used to a touchscreen without any buttons will be a challenge when I'm so used to a keyboard with all its shortcuts.\n\nNo HDMI almost turned me off on this one.  I still wish it had an HDMI port and smh why dell didn't include one.\n\nCapacity - I haven't started installing much stuff, so I can't comment on how limiting the 32GB will be, but I do think it will be a problem factor if I treat this as a laptop replacement and install all my software.\n\nSound - the speaker is on the bottom and sound is muffled and low.  If you watch a video upright and have it rest on your lap, the sound is being blocked on the bottom side.  This was a huge design mistake, why not place a small speaker opening on the front side of the device on the edge of the touchscreen instead?\n\nI'm going to try this out for a few days and decide if I want to keep it.  I know tablets are not a laptop replacement, but I have already experienced compatibility problems on a small touchscreen tablet using software (and webpages) that were intended for a PC.  One of my main concerns was having to buy software for a tablet that I already own on PC and avoid paying again for an app version.  You pay for apps because they are optimized for tabets.  I didn't want this to be another money-sink platform in the house.  We have TV's and bluray players in nearly every room, so I needed something closer to a laptop in functionality, but more portable, that goes beyond playing music, netflix, or just internet browsing to justify it and I'm not really seeing that being met here."}

We use a web based texting app from our cell provider to easily and quickly text when we need to; It is very easy to check email, access media on our HTPC and download and read bills or documents.  Our main use is to have Skype readily available to make or receive video calls.  The system is fast, video is more than acceptable.  I don't have any complaints on the sound either.  The disk is encrypted so we allow windows to save our website passwords and that's a real plus.  People have mentioned battery drain but I watched a full Star Wars episode and had over 67% of battery remaining and I had been using it all day.  We don't store media on the tablets they are streaming destinations but I did use some 2gb micro SD cards for a \"save to\" area.  If you spend a lot of time in waiting rooms while the kids get their teeth cleaned or something of the sort - this unit is great to take advantage of the free wi-fi and actually get things done, keep yourself amused or catch up with the news or email."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "First off i will go over some of the flaws other have reported and tell you what i think.\n\n1.  Screen - Comparing to the nexus 5 many say it doesn't stand up.  My issue is that it is an 8\" tablet and 720p for an 8\" looks great.  Screen was a little dim but you need to turn off adaptive display to be able to control the brightness.  This will reduce battery life substantially (more on that later)\n\n2.  Not as many apps as android tablet.  -  look you are buying a windows 8 tablet, if what is important to you is the shear number of apps get an apple device.  Also what people don't realize is that alot of android/ios games are Facebook games.  mthese can be played when you visit Facebook through the browser.\n\nBattery life -  this is the only real flaw that i found with this tablet.  At about 60% brightness i am getting about 5-6 hours of battery life.  Battery drain on standby is about 5% every 8 hours.\n\nPros - this thing is fast.  Internet comes up without pause and multi tasking doesn't slow it down at all.  It could easily be a desktop replacement for most people except for the size, then again, if you want a desktop replacement, why would you even think about an 8\" tablet.\n\nWindows 8.1 - I have an iPad, and an android tablet and for Microsoft to come into the game late and compete, they have to be better.  In this case, they may have succeeded.  The effectiveness of the atom chip is so good that it probably will kill any hope for windows RT.  This is the second device that has been released to the public with the new chip and windows 8.1.  once the other devices start to be released, I predict more and more users will switch back to windows.  There are so many things you can do on this tablet that you can't do on a ios or android tablet."}

Not only is it working, its working well, dependably and the set up is fast. much faster than my brain thinks a little device like this should move. wow. And remember this is USB 2.0 on the device. And its all working well. Insane. Just can't believe there is only 2GB of RAM in this.\n\nBuild quality is very solid. no flex. feels like it will last a long time. Full Windows 8.1 just seems amazing. Camera is decent for video conferencing for Skype and works well.\n\nXBOX 360 Smartglass works.\n\nSure it's a pain that I can't charge while also driving all of the above, but with a battery life that seems to go all day, who really cares?

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I had the opportunity to test out a Dell Venue 8 Pro over the weekend, and I walked away thoroughly impressed. Having used Apple products almost exclusively over the past seven or eight years, it's surprisingly refreshing to see former heavyweights Dell and Microsoft swing back with a low-price tablet that also runs full-fledged PC apps.\n\nPros:\n- Runs Windows 8.1, a complete desktop OS. This is really an amazing feat in itself.\n- Performance is snappy. While this is by no means meant for desktop gaming, this should be more than sufficient for word processing, email, and watching video.\n- The screen, weight, and soft touch backing makes the Venue 8 a really nice tablet to hold.\n- The tile-based touch UI maximizes the usable space on screen, making it a lot easier to find and open apps.\n- Expandable memory makes it easy to add 64GB of space inexpensively. That means more storage for pictures, videos, and apps.\n- Switching to desktop mode is a slick, seamless process and lets you use your tablet the way you'd use a laptop.\n\nCons:\n- The screen has a 1200x800 resolution, which is a lot less than the Nexus 7 or iPad Mini Retina, making it a little less easy on the eyes when reading small text. It's a shame since this form factor would be really great as an ereader.\n- Without resizing your screen, it's impractical using the desktop mode without a stylus. Even simple tasks like closing a window is a chore using fingers alone.\n- There's a bit of a learning curve to using all the gestures. For example, snapping apps into place in desktop mode is a pretty neat trick, but it's not all that apparent when you fire it up.\n\nWith the relevance of desktop PCs waning, the one lingering question I have is how important it is for a tablet to run PC apps? This obviously isn't the right tablet for hard-core gaming or running professional desktop apps like Adobe Photoshop, and competing devices have no problem displaying email, ebooks, or video. That said, if you're looking for desktop performance in a handheld form factor, this just might be the perfect tablet for you."}

The processor speed is simply amazing. When you hear \"Atom\", that will naturally repel you, but Intel has upgraded them far from the terrible netbook processors they used to be. It runs Windows 8.1, which is fast and fluid on the Atom. Overall the best Windows 8.1 tablet under $400."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I really like this tablet and think it shows off a lot of what Windows 8.1 has going for it. First off, the size and weight are nearly perfect for both portrait and landscape modes.  Coupling this with the great display makes for probably the best Windows true tablet experience to date.  The new Atom processor has fantastic battery life and general performance that is on par with full size laptops.  Also, Dell has done a great job with the overall build quality and design that feels solid and premium in the hand. Of course, this is a great choice over the Surface RT as the Dell has both full Windows 8.1 for desktop apps and services (like iTunes, Spotify, and Steam) plus the full version of Office (Home and Student).\n\nThe biggest drawbacks to me are the lack of video out and only the single micro usb port.  I would love to be able to do some light desktop gaming with this, but unless you buy an expensive accessory, it's practically impossible.  Plus, the small screen is awkward to use in desktop mode with legacy applications.  Finally, it is slow to charge and tends to use more power in standby mode than other similar devices.\n\nI cross shopped this with the other super popular Windows 8.1 tablet, the Asus T100.  The Asus has considerably more features for about the same price with the inclusion of a keyboard dock, a full-sized usb 3.0 port, and micro HDMI out.  The Dell does have one advantage in that it includes a rear-facing camera.  The keyboard dock plus the larger screen makes the Asus much more usable in desktop mode with legacy applications.  Ultimately, I found the whole experience of Windows 8.1 better on the larger device.  The Windows store just doesn't quite offer enough tablet apps to make smaller screens like the Dell completely practical yet.  However, Dell has created a fantastic small tablet that is certainly a worthy competitor to the likes of the Nexus 7 and iPad Mini.\n\nFYI, I've previously owned the iPad 2 and 3, Nexus 7 (2012), and Kindle Fire HD, plus current Windows and Mac laptops and desktops."}

I bought it because I'm tired of taking my laptop to school because it's pretty heavy. With this tablet I have the features of a regular laptop but lighter.\nThe screen is pretty good, don't get discouraged about the fact that is less  number than the iPad or Nexus and it runs pretty good.\nThere is a few things that Dell should work on in the next venue or you should be aware of are:\n1) It get kind of hot in the back specially in the part where is the battery after a while. I haven't really push the battery to see how much does it last but I think that its pretty decent.\n2) Sometimes if the link, icon or button that i'm trying to press it's too small, It will take a while to press it.\n3) A couple of times the OS crash on my venue. Nothing special though, just letting you guys know.\n4) The space...I bought the 64 Gb version but after the Windows and Microsoft Office Student edition installation, it went down to 36 Gb. You can add 64 Gb with the microSD. For now, I added the Google Drive Desktop application.\n5) The amount of apps in Windows 8 is very low compare to the App Store or Google Play.\n\nHopefully, this review helps you. At the bottom line, I bought this tablet because it gives me the facility of having the laptop experience. Again, I'm an IT student and I need to be able to run software that will only run in a regular laptop so I've been always hesitating about buying a iPad or Nexus. I was saving money to buy the Surface 2 but $1,000 is too much comparing to the price that this  tablet is."}

I'm sure that Microsoft never designed Win 8.1 UI for an 8\" tablet, and it shows.  Running purely Metro Apps is fine, switch to desktop view to mimic your PC and it gets problematic.  Nothing that a stylus might not fix, but with no stylus, I had to reach for my OTG cable and connect my wireless mouse and keyboard to get some clicks to work.  Touch is just not accurate enough for \"normal\" desktop use.  The beauty is that you can go ahead and install your regular programs, drivers etc. just the same as you would with a desktop computer.  The overall performance is not bad, and it gives you another option versus a notebook computer for on the go use.  Battery life is great and I'm sure with a stylus and a nice case, I'll be able to use this in about 80% of cases that I would normally have to use my notebook.  I'm probably going to invest in some desktop docking gizmos, and have the option of big screen connectivity at my desk.  Think of this as a really small PC on the go and not so much of a tablet.

AND, it comes with full Microsoft Office!  This is usually over $100!\n\nSome tips from an OCD Windows user:  the first time you turn it on, go to the Dell Support web page and find the drivers for the Venue 8 Pro.  Install the Screen firmware and the BIOS - doing this is slightly advanced so don't worry about it if you're not seeing any problems.  Then reset the tablet under the Settings --> Update and Recovery section.  When it resets and starts over uninstall all the Dell programs (luckily there are only 5 or so, all benign but useless)  and any app you don't think you'll use.  Then enjoy!\n\nAgain, this are just some advanced and obsessive compulsive tips - your tablet will be incredible even if you don't do this, and important Windows Updates should install automatically.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I'm going to post this review under both the Dell Venue 8 Pro and the Lenovo Miix 8 as I believe some people may find the comparison helpful.\n\nI will cut to the chase and say that I have decided to keep the Venue 8 Pro and return the Lenovo Miix 8. I rated both of the devices a 5 because they are both very similar and I didn't feel it was fair to dock the Lenovo just because I preferred the Dell. If I could have rated the Lenovo 4.75, I would have.\n\nHere is what I like and dislike about both devices:\n\n1. Screen on the Dell is better than the Lenovo in my opinion. For example, in the Kindle App for Windows 8, after changing the settings to white text on black background, you get a truly \"black\" background on the Dell whereas it is more of a gray on the Lenovo. Also, the colors just seem to be more accurate on the Dell. The Lenovo offers a brighter screen but the Dell is plenty bright for me. I was also able to dim the backlight on the Dell more than the Lenovo which was helpful to me for nighttime reading. These are not major issues but it was something I noticed after comparing side by side.\n\n2. I have grown to prefer the build materials and quality of the Dell more than the Lenovo. The Lenovo is thinner and lighter which I thought was something that was important to me, but the Dell is much more comfortable to hold. This is mainly because the Dell is made from some sort of rubberized plastic material that is very \"grippy\". It just feels comfortable to hold. The Lenovo on the other hand is made from some sort of slick plastic and it always felt like I was going to drop it. Also, the Lenovo made a faint \"creaking\" and \"crackling\" sound whenever I held it.\n\n3. I originally didn't like Dell's placement of the start button on top of the device, and this was one of the reasons that I purchased the Lenovo. After using them both, I have grown to prefer Dell's implementation since I don't ever power off the device. The Start button acts as my \"on\" button and I have grown accustomed to the placement. I thought I would prefer the Lenovo with its capacitive button, but I find myself having to hit the button at least twice to activate it which is very frustrating. I realize it must be very difficult to design a capacitive button with just the right level of sensitivity, but if Surface and many Android tablets can pull it off, so should Lenovo. Hopefully both companies will figure out a way to engineer a hard button on the front like on the iPad.\n\n4. I thought I would prefer having the GPS that the Lenovo offers, but since there aren't currently any good GPS apps for Windows 8 touch devices, I didn't find much use for it. I tried it with Streets and Trips and the program would not recognize the GPS sensor.\n\n5. I get slightly better sound quality from the headphone jack of the Dell than I do with the Lenovo. It's just a minor difference and probably just a matter of personal preference, but it is something that is important to me.\n\n6. Actual user performance on both devices was about equal for me, even though the Lenovo apparently offers a slightly better processor.\n\n7. The Lenovo offers a cheaper case and stylus than the Dell. I have found the Lenovo case and stylus for as low as twenty dollars here on Amazon.\n\n8. I was able to pick up the Dell unit for twenty five dollars less than the Lenovo and see a lot of deals on the 32 gb version of the Dell. Something to consider.\n\n9. Battery life seems to be similar on both but I can't say I have performed any scientific tests to verify.\n\nHere is a list of tablets that I currently own and used as reference points in deciding whether or not to keep the Dell:\n\n1. iPad 2. I no longer have any need for this device and find it to be too limited for its size and weight. I have handed this down to my wife and kids. The kids get a LOT of mileage out of it playing various learning and leisure games. My wife mainly reads books and plays candy crush on it.\n\n2. Kindle Fire HD 8.9. I ONLY use this device because of the text to speech feature and only when I need to read something technical and/or boring for work. I tried to \"upgrade\" to the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" and later learned that Amazon crippled this amazing feature (you have to buy the audio book now) so I ended up returning the HDX. I may upgrade again if Amazon ever brings this functionality back.\n\n3. ThinkPad Tablet 2. This is my go to device for customer meetings as it is very convenient for taking notes with the screen size and dock-able stylus. That said, the device is a little slow for my taste so I'm really looking forward to the new version early next year.\n\n4. Nexus 7 (1st gen). Too slow and battery life sucks. Pretty much collects dust now but I do use it occasionally as a controller for my Sonos system.\n\n5. Surface 2. Love this device with the Type Cover 2 and use it as a bridge between my home pc (Samsung Series 7 Slate) and work pc.\n\n6. Kindle Paperwhite. Love this device for long reading sessions as I don't get any eye strain like I do on my LCD devices.\n\n7. iPad Mini (1st gen) Great for what it is, but very limited in what I can do with it. I use it mainly as a quick consumption device and ebook reader. I might end up getting rid of it now that I have decided to keep the Dell Venue 8 pro.\n\nWell, I think that is everything I wanted to share. I do want to make it clear that I like both the Dell and Lenovo very much, and would have kept the Lenovo if the Dell wasn't a choice. Thankfully, I have a choice and will stick with the Dell."}

Only downside is it doesn't have HDMI out but I can use my Surface RT for that when needed.  I do recommend getting the 64gb version for the minimal $50 upgrade price, but you can add a 64gb microSD card for more space but it's better to have it all on the C: drive and add 64gb on top of it."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I bought two of these for my 7 and 8.5 year old daughters for Christmas and have been setting them up.  I had previously gotten them cheap Asus 15\" laptops, but they destroyed the power connections so they don't charge.  I was hoping for something more rugged this time around.  I debated between these and the inventory blown out original Surface RTs which are selling for two hundred bucks right now at the Microsoft store and BB for Black Friday.  I figured the 8\" form factor would be easier for them to hold and move around with than the 10.6\" Surface. Though you can't get better than the build quality on the Surface line, ultimately I went with these when I happened on the Amazon door-buster for $229 apiece.  What you get is full 8.1 32bit non-pro version of Windows.  This is nice for management since you can have them join your existing homegroup share out their media and then move files *to* them instead of having to pull from an RT device.  The IPS screens are beautiful, to get the full experience you should go into the charms / settings / pc settings / power and turn off auto brightness dim.\n\nMy dad and I went through 5 first gen Windows 8 tablets this last summer and these easily best those due to their latest Atom chip, much perkier than prior version (and considerably quicker than the Surface RT's Tegra 3, fwiw).  There is no lag moving around in the UI; desktop mode is ah tiny as you would imagine on a device of this size.  My girls will use this as content consumption devices and gaming while I try to fix the laptops. :-)  Dell has the Bluetooth keyboard listed as still coming soon.  I got them 64GB MicroSD cards for family movies, photos and music.  The internal 32GB does get used between Office, the recovery partition and their various games including some big Xbox games.  It looks great reading in portrait mode via Kindle and Nook apps; and Pinball FX is a lot of fun in portrait.  Any cons, hmm, as others have mentioned the back gets warm during 3d gaming; I don't mind the placement of the start button on the side.\n\nI'm glad Dell and Win 8.1 has hit this 8\" form factor properly.. The Acer W3 was one of the tablets we tried this last summer, though the first 8\" it was universally panned for its bad screen and is being re-done as the W4.  In the meantime, we have this great Dell and the Lenovo Miix 8 which wasn't readily available when I got these. I'm very happy with the purchase, recommended."}

Compared with the Asus T100 which I have read a lot of negative as far as reliability, wifi issues the Dell Venue 8 PRO is a very nice breath of fresh air. This tablet runs FULL Windows 8.1 so just about all your PC apps will run on here that are not high end. Even some awesome games like Dirt 3, etc can run albiet with the settings on medium to low depending on the age of the game. You can play Xbox games from the Windows store and there are some nice options such as Halo, Asphalt 8, etc. If you're looking for a larger screen for reading maybe try the HP Omni 10 tablet, it is Full Windows 8.1 but only has 32gb Internal Storage with a MicroSD slot and only $399. HP's Omni10 screen resolution is 1920x1200. The Dell Venue 11 Pro base model is 10.6\" screen at $449 with 64gb and includes MicroSD slot for storage expansion. It's screen resolution is only 1920x1080p which is still Full HD."}

Setup was relatively painless, wifi connectivity is great, screen is very good, battery life is excellent, and it runs heavy duty PC programs like Quicken with a massive database.  I was also able to customize it with Chrome and Google drive without a problem.  It is definitely easier to set up with the programs you want than Android and Apple, where you are limited to the apps and often it is cumbersome to use browsers, search engines, maps, or email programs that are not \"native\".  Windows 8 takes some time to get used to, but it does work reasonably well.  The combination of this tablet with a bluetooth keyboard makes a great miniature productivity laptop."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I was shopping around for a Windows based tablet for the past 6 months.  Kept looking at the Microsoft Surface RT (didn't want to pay the price of the pro) and also looking here at ASUS and Lenovo.  When I saw the Venue come out I wanted to touch one so went to the Microsoft Store a few blocks from my office.  I spent about an hour going back and forth between the Suface 2 and the Venue.  The main reason was size and comparison between RT and Full Windows 8.1.  I wanted something that splits between a PC, Tablet, and eReader (huge Kindle fan).  After thinking about what my life would be like sitting on an Airplane and what would be more comfortable to work with I picked the Venue 8 Pro.  I have had this for about 4 days now (bought at Microsoft Store, price was the same as prime and I was in an instant satisfaction mode).\n\nWhat I like:\n1.  Size, this is large enough that the office tools, apps, and web browsing are functional\n2.  It keeps my Kindle on my night stand when I travel.  I was using my Windows Phone and it worked find but it was a bit small and this is much better and holds like my Kindle\n3.  It is full blown Windows, not RT so I can load my other apps on it\n4.  The disk space is good,  with 64G it leaves over 30G to use,  I added a 32G MicroSD card to it and can't think of how I will run out of space.\n5.  Full Windows from the start screen is familiar, don't need to learn anything new.  Not a huge fan of Windows 8 but on a tablet it works great.\n\nWhat I don't like:\nConfiguring Windows 8.1 on a small device is a bit tedious, so need to be patient on the setups and get a stylus (I had one).\n\nThe few comments on the start button being on the side really isn't an issue, a left swipe from the right side of the screen gets you to start very quickly.  So far battery is great, I did remove the dimming and put my own setting on.  I got alittle over 9 hours on the battery that way and other than international flights don't know when I wouldn't be in a position to charge it throughout the day.\n\nThe screen is good, I added a bluetooth keyboard / case to this and still getting used to the keyboard.  The split keyboard on screen actually works well in the hand and I may toss the bluetooth keyboard.  I don't plan on writing documents on this and mostly for email, reading, and browsing.\n\nAlready put Pandora on it, sounds OK with the speaker.  Have Sonos at home and have that installed as well as few other apps I like.  Really don't need thousands of apps and there are enough to make this fully functional for my use.\n\nThe last point is I didn't buy an Apple because they just charge too much for the brand.  I actually had a significant amount of interest from the iPAD users who started to go look at reviews on this after they saw it.  $349 for a Full Windows 8 tablet with 64G, 8\" screen (Kindle form factor) is hard to ignore.\n\nGo ahead and buy it, you will like it for utility."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I do 90% of my work on an Android Tablet (Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014) but there are times and there are specific applications where I simply have to have Windows. I do not really want to carry a laptop for those rare occasions. The 8 inch, Windows 8.1 Dell Venue Pro seemed like an ideal solution. I really wanted to like the Dell, and I got a good pre-black Friday deal on it, but...\n1) the text and window controls are way too small for my aging eyes. Setting the overall scaling to 150% and the text sizes of titles, menus, etc to 11 points (up from the default 9) helps, but there are just too many things in Windows and in Windows apps that do not scale or do not scale well. In the new interface, for instance, the titles of the tiles do not appear to scale at all. You can change tile size, but the text remains tiny.\n2) Windows 8.1 does not work well on an 8 inch touch screen, especially in landscape mode. The most basic of input dialogs (like in the Windows installer) do not scale to the screen so you can not see the enter or submit button. The on-screen keyboard too often covers the text input fields, and it does not automatically pop-up when you enter a text field. It is impossible to scroll pop-up or drop-down input menues in many apps. Some apps resist touch input all together. This is NOT Android by any means. By comparison, Android is a fully mature touch interface that works, the vast majority of the time, as it should. W8.1 has a long way to go.\n3) All of that is compounded by the poor touch response of the Dell touchscreen. I am used to highly tuned touch of my Samsung Android devices. Most operations on the Dell are very difficult. Buttons do not respond. Check boxes do not check (even when you can get your finger on them). I generally had to poke at the screen many times to initiate any action. Very frustrating.\n\nThose are the reasons the Dell is going back. The reasons I hate to send it back?\n1) Visually, the screen is excellent. Colors are brilliant and accurate. Everything looks sharp (just too small).\n2) The build quality is excellet. The tablet feels solid and comfortable in the hands.\n3) It is exactly the right size and price for a back-up Windows solution for my mostly Android mobile life.\n4) Though Windows 8.1 still has a ways to go...it has real promise.\n\nAnd I STILL need a mobile Windows solution. I will try a bit bigger tablet, and hope for one with a more responsive touch screen."}

No longer do I have to give up laptop functionality in a perfect sized tablet. I also have a Surface Pro 2 which is great, but this Dell has won my heart. Super light, works with my peripherals, beautiful screen (e.g. streaming Amazon Prime videos). I did buy the female USB to male microUSB adapter so I could connect my GoPro, Windows Phone, and others. I also ordered a 64GB microSD card to add for video storage (GoPro videos while traveling). I am also very pleased with the snappiness of the processor and memory.\n\nThe negatives that I have found are taking a picture in low light ... pic quality is bad. But my smartphone is for quick pics so nothing lost there. I also haven't found a great case/stand yet ... not willing to pay the price Dell is asking for theirs. I keep searching Amazon for one.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "This awesome little tablet was just delivered to me today and I must say its a nice little thing. I refer to it as little because I am absolutely amazed dell was able to make such a fast, productive device fit in such a tiny package. In my opinion, this is what the surface pro 1 and definitely the 2 should have been. I have never used a surface pro, I'm only speaking because the pro is heavy and I'm a person that likes to keep all her electronics light as possible. I have been an apple fan for the last 4 years after my 1yr old touchscreen hp died. I vowed NEVER to purchase anything windows, dell has made me change my mind. I started taking a Microsoft office class and didn't want to have to use the computers at the school library so I purchased a cheap laptop and I got what I paid for. I'm amazed that this dell venue blows the 15inch laptop out of the water! This thing is incredibly fast. Being an 8 inch tablet I didn't expect the ms word experience to be productive. The only issue I have is when it comes to resizing pictures (dragging the handles). This thing is fast and the touch experience is extremely accurate. I plan on hooking this up to a bigger monitor and getting some homework done. I'm glad I took a chance. Time to retire my iPad for a while. EXTRA INFO. My home is ALL Apple, I have an iPad, iPhone, Macbook pro and MacBook Air (just purchased the air 5months ago). For me to step away from the apple products and not constantly complain....Dell did it and I say thank you!"}

Being able to install just about ANY program on the desktop is amazing (if you can't install a program, google it I'm sure there's a way, I mean people have gotten Skyrim to run on this thing!). Whether in metro or desktop mode this device can handle it all. But the best part about this is the price. I honestly needed a new laptop for school and since I'm a starving college student I have 0 funds.

My wife has an IPad and it is very user friendly. I have a large Android phone and I prefer that UI over the Apple. WIndows 8.1 for a tablet is garbage. I have to update drivers from Dell (which did not work) and then have to update the OS with Microsoft. I want a device that is formatted well for the small screen.  I think Microsoft is doomed. Intel was smart to expand their chip business to other OSes since Microsoft can't deliver on the small screen. Very disappointed with this purchase."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I know this review will annoy all the 8.1 zealots out there. In fact, I'm beginning to wonder if all these glowing reviews were written by Dell employees.  If you want a tablet you can use, buy an Android or an Apple.  If you're a techie and want to spend your time troubleshooting wireless connectivity issues, windows update issues, Microsoft Knowledge Base articles, and software bugs of all sorts, this is the tablet for you.\n\nDell did a FABULOUS job on the hardware (not the most advanced technology but overall nicely packaged for the price).  The screen is bright and crisp.  The tablet is well built unit and it feels and looks good.  The Bing weather app is EXCELLENT and very full featured, and I love 8.1's ability to send things to the \"Reading List\" app. But Windows 8.1 itself is too unintuitive compared to iOS or Android to hand this to an non-techie. If you need Windows productivity functionality, then this might be a great tablet for you (but plan to use the stylus-pen because there's no way you can click on all the small menus and boxes, etc. with even a slender finger without a lot of retries and frustration).  Here are just a few problems with Windows 8.1 that led me to rate this only 3 stars (later I downgraded the review to two stars--see updates below):\n\n1.  There are too many mystery functions that waste too much time to figure out.  Stuff that's easy in every other OS is UNINTUITIVE in 8.1.  Yes, I know the gestures, but I had to waste time searching for things that should be obvious without looking them up (like how to set a PIN code for the lock screen;  I never had to look things up for my Android, iOS, or WebOS smartphones--it was just obvious.\n2.  The email app is crude at best.  You can't even swipe to read your next email in Portrait mode (you've got to go back first and then select the next one in the list).\n3.  There is no way to see the time on your main metro screen (you've got to swipe into the charm bar to get it to appear).  You've got to buy an app to see the time without swiping into the charm bar.\n4.  There is no way to see your remaining battery life without swiping into the charm bar or going to the traditional windows desktop (there is also an itty-bitty icon on the lock screen);  but only the icon on the desktop's quick launch bar gives you the percentage remaining.  You can't buy an app that will give you the percentage of battery remaining, so you've got to go to the desktop which is too much unnecessary launching and swiping. This, along with the time, should be on the main screen.\n5.  The Apps Store is still fairly limited.  There are some good apps in there, but many that I wanted (like the battery app) weren't available.\n6.  Windows desperately needs a \"Back\" button.  Too many times I found it impossible in one app or another to go back to a prior screen without wasting time. Swiping from the top or bottom didn't help.\n7.  The consistency between the way the applications work is poor.  Sometimes there's a back button and sometimes there isn't. Android 1.0 was more intuitive than this.\n8.  The maps app graphics are low quality compared to Google Maps on Android or Apple.  There's also no street view.\n9.  LIMITED VOICE COMMANDS from within apps (voice doesn't appear fully integrated like it is in Apple or Android OS).  This is a big hole. There is usually no alternative to typing for input to various programs. I've become accustomed to Android's voice feature to dictate my emails and text messages on a Galaxy S4 (it isn't perfect, but more than good enough to use regularly).  This is a huge hole in Win 8.1 considering every other OS has had voice functionality for quite a while.\n10.  All you can do on the keyboard is type one key at a time.  There's no SWYPE option, which would greatly speed up typing and improve accuracy. There's no microphone key to use voice instead.  In some apps the keyboard comes up automatically when you click in a blank box, other times you've got to bring up the keyboard manually;  again there is little consistency.\n11.  On many apps, the keyboard gets in the way of filling out fields because you can't scroll the app low enough so it becomes a challenge to type without seeing what you're doing.  You've got to move the keyboard around.\n\nI need Remote Desktop and I understand Windows well, so I'll keep this machine.  But Win 8.1 is a time waster with a steep learning curve and there's no way my wife would be as happy as with an Android or an Apple.  It would have been nice if she could have had full Windows functionality, but if she can't easily manipulate the OS, what good is it?  The breadth and polish of the apps in the Android and iOS ecosystem are so superior, I really can't think of a reason to use a Win 8.1 tablet unless you specifically need to run some Windows-based program (yes, this is a BIG plus if you need the functionality).\n\nUPDATE 12/2/13:\nThe battery life on this tablet is sometimes AWESOME and other times it's mediocre.  I haven't been able to identify the reason.  I used Sysinternals Process Explorer to examine all the processes, but couldn't identify a reason.  I've never found heat to be an issue.  It only gets warm if I give it a big task that requires a fair amount of CPU time.\n\nAnother reason Win 8.1 isn't ideal for the casual user:  installation of add-ins to Internet Explorer often do not go smoothly.  The install won't finish until IE is closed, but you've got to go to Task Manager to make sure it is completely closed so the installer can finish (merely closing IE on the desktop or from metro is insufficient to let the installer continue).  Users don't have to put up with this kind of \"techie\" workaround in Android.  I am also noticing that Office programs like Excel often \"Stop Working\" and must be restarted so Win 8.1 and Office still have a fair number of bugs.\n\nUPDATE 12/11/13:\nI'm downgrading my review to 2 stars.  The Venue 8 Pro has too many gremlins and bugs.  It's not ready for prime time, unless you are a techie who enjoys reading knowledge base articles and searching thru the forums and reinstalling drivers and the like.  Here are more examples:\n\nThere are frequent issues with the Venue coming out of sleep;  occasionally I've got to do a hard reboot;  after logging in, the screen goes blank and won't come back on without repeated presses of the power button.  Sometimes I've got to do a second hard restart. The problem originated with updates KB2883200 and KB2887595 and is a KNOWN ISSUE;  I had to uninstall these updates to get the Venue to work properly though the wireless disconnects still remain;\n\nThere are wireless issues;  the Venue sometimes loses connectivity and NO available connections appear on the connections screen;  sometimes, an error message will appear that say the ethernet connection does not have a correct IP address.  Sometimes a restart fixes this problem and sometimes it doesn't.  The Windows \"Fix Problem\" wizard is equally erratic at fixing the problem; you've got to screw around with it until you can get the connections to appear again so you can connect. From what I seen in the forums, this is a well-known wireless driver issue.\n\nDell's own application to run system checks often won't run with this message:  \"An instance is already open\".  You've got to do a restart to fix this.  In fact, there isn't another instance open when you get this message and it doesn't appear as a running application in Task Manager.\n\nI've restarted the Venue more times in one month than I have my Galaxy S2 in over two full years of use."}

I went with the 32GB because I won't be installing a lot of other applications. It is incredibly fast for day to day stuff like browsing the web and reading eMails. Loading applications is almost instantaneous, switching from one program to another is just as quick. I also have a 2nd gen iPad, which seems significantly slower when compared to the Venue.\n\nBattery life is quite good, enough to last for the better part of the day with light use. As others have mentioned, the screen is not the highest resolution, but it is very bright and has really good viewing angles.\n\nThe tablet is very thin, and light when compared to the iPad. It's got a plastic backing which has a texture that makes it easy to hold without dropping on the floor. The windows key is in a strange location but you get used to it after a while.\n\nI have ordered the stylus from Dell.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "Decided to edit my review due to numerous post by Dell fanboys disputing any negative comments about the V8P.  I'm glad I returned mine.\n\nI came away unimpressed.  Setup took quite a awhile with Windows 8.1 updates and firmware downloads from Dell.  After getting thru the initial battle I noticed slow wifi speeds.  I double checked the wifi firmware upgrade but still could only manage half my usual throughput.  I confirmed the slow speeds against my laptop, iPad,  LG G Pad, and new Note 8.0.  All those devices gave me full speeds with my router, the Venue 8 Pro failed to get anywhere close.  This could just be an issue with my router but I don't want to have to buy a new router just to accommodate the Dell.\n\nScreen resolution isn't bad and I think they did well considering it's not 1080p.  The one caveat is poor contrast in video playback.  Shadows are blocked up and lose detail making low light movie scenes difficult to watch.  Essentially, you can just expect to see black voids where video ought to be.\n\nIf you intend to just use Metro apps the device will probably serve you well. Metro is speedy and apps like Flipboard are a joy to use.  IE running in Metro is much easier to use than the desktop browsers.  I found the desktop navigation cumbersome and not worth the trouble.  Chrome was particularly annoying with a great deal of lag and missed screen touches.  Also, there is no automatic keyboard initialization in desktop mode.  To get the keyboard you'll have to hit the keyboard icon in the task bar.  Using a bluetooth mouse resolves some of the hassle but that's an inherent Win 8 issue not the device.  Win 8 dweebs will love spending hours figuring out how to get the tab to operate like an Android device does out of the box.\n\nThe microsSD card slot is like the ObamaCare website...almost impossible to get in to, then you'll wished you hadn't.  The slot is recessed so far you'll need a tool to insert a card and then tweezers to remove it.  Bad design. However, I'm sure there's a bunch of Dell geeks sitting in a basement somewhere designing tool to easily remove the SD card.\n\nUSB charging is another \"what for?\".  You're going to use the included charger or you're outa luck.  Want to use an external battery?...NOPE!  I tried two different external batteries and neither would charge the tablet.  Expecting to connect to your laptop and mount it as a drive?..NOPE! How foolish I must be to think I could connect a Win 8 tablet to a Win 8 laptop and transfer files via the USB port.  That whole drag and drop thing is overrated anyway.  It's so much easier to upload to Skydrive and download to the V8P, especially when you don't have access to wifi.\n\nExternal Windows Home Key, weird placement, nothing more to say.\n\nGPS, oh yeah, doesn't have one.\n\nDell Active Stylus was buggy in note taking.  The stylus would register before and after touching the screen and leave tails on the pen flow.  I understand Dell may have released a firmware fix for this but mine was returned beforehand, YMMV.  Of course, I've always preferred to have my handwriting to look like a second grader with epilepsy.\n\nBenchmark scores in 3Dmark were excellent (over 15,000 in Ice Storm Unlimited) and game play graphics are smooth with outstanding frame rates.  Who cares if there are very few worthwhile games to play.\n\nOverall, it's a good device if you don't expect to use it or enjoy reading text written on a grain of rice.  With the large number of tablets hitting the stores this year a prudent buyer might want to look around before making a decision.  Or, better yet...try out the pleasure of the user experience by slamming your fingers in the silverware drawer."}

Unorganized, clueless, no follow through, broken promises. The whole thing feels like a 'boiler room' scam organization. Pray you never need to contact them. Hopefully the venue 8 pro is solid"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "Crosspost from my blog josephdickerson.com:\n\nI love living in the future.\n\nI have a LOT of technology in my house, more than my family (of five) need. In fact, I just counted: I have more desktops, laptops and tablets than I have fingers...\n\nAnd I just bought another one.\n\nWhy? Was it pure unbridled techlust (again) rearing it's ugly head? No. It was because the device I purchased is a breakthrough piece of tech, and a computer I never knew I needed... until I had it in my hands.\n\nIt's the 32GB Dell Venue 8 Pro, a Windows 8.1 tablet that is not just a tablet... it's a full Win 8 computer, with access to the desktop and ability to install and run any legacy Windows apps. It's very much like an iPad mini, but with the added value of being able to access the file system and Microsoft Office. I'm mighty impressed.\n\nSo impressed, I'm actually writing up this review. I'm not a \"tech review\" kind of writer, so when I spend the time to do something like this... it matters.\n\nThe device is easy to use in the Win 8 \"modern\" mode, the flat design that Microsoft did long before Jony Ive thought about doing the same for IOS... and surprisingly easy too use in the traditional Windows desktop mode. It's got a great screen, good speaker, over eight hours of battery life, and with the Windows Store featuring (most) of the apps that I am used to using on the iPad it's allowed me to pass my third gen iPad down to one of my sons.\n\nDell (a company I am NOT a fan of, by the way) may have done something I never thought possible... they may have created an iPad killer. Yes, that is pretty high-grade hyperbole, but the more you think about it, the more the possibility rings true. Dell certainly believes they have something special, because they are spending a lot of marketing money promoting the device on TV and print. They are proud of the device, and justifiably so... it's a fast, well designed piece of hardware that works as a replacement laptop with the addition of a bluetooth keyboard and mouse.\n\nWhile I am a fan of Apple's products, I think they are making some mistakes of late, and their emphasis on high profit margins rather than the customer is one of the biggest ones. There is NO REASON for most of their products to be priced as high as they are, and that leaves an opening for competitors like Dell and Google to come in and take potential sales away from them. The Venue 8 Pro is $299, and when you throw in a 64GB storage card for ~$45, you get a device that can serve as a true laptop replacement for most people.\n\nApple needs to watch out, because I used to be a fanboy for their products... and yet, Dell just got $300 from me. That is something that could be considered a \"teachable moment.\""}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I got this tablet as a companion device to my Surface Pro. (This sentence alone should alert you to the fact that I am very familiar with Windows 8.1 devices and that I enjoy having the MS ecosystem to work in.) The size of the Dell Venue 8 is perfect for carrying around at work- something that was cumbersome even with the SP2.\n\nI was able to configure the Dell with the exact same set of programs, appearance, and settings that I have on the Surface; thus, 2 identical devices other than size. With SkyDrive and OneNote, all of my data, documents and notes are synchronized among all of my devices, including the Dell.\n\nSome positive observations:\n- The Venue's Wi-Fi is just as fast as the SP2\n- The Surface has a beautiful display, and when switching between the two devices the Dell's display does look a little washed out. On the other hand, it is perfectly serviceable, and reading on the Dell is easy on my aged eyes.\n- Switching between applications and between webpages seems to be about as fast on the Dell; I am astonished with the performance of the new Bay Trail processor.\n- The Dell awakens from sleep immediately; I can pick it up, press the power button, and check my on-line references immediately when I need information\n- Just for fun, I tried loading Photoshop Elements on the Dell. Loading the program is brisk. With a Bluetooth mouse (I have the MS sculpt mouse) I can actually do a fair bit of photo editing! I was not expecting to be able to do this at all due to the size of the screen!\n- All this for around $300...incredible!\n\nI have no need to stream my media to a TV or projector, so I don't miss HDMI output. With the Bluetooth mouse, I also don't need the stylus. I am not a gamer, so I don't miss the \"hundreds of thousands\" of games in the IOS and Android worlds. In fact, there is no application or functionality that I find lacking on the Dell Venue 8.\n\nThe only negative observations I have about this device stem from the size itself- the consequences of being so light and portable all stem from being so small. I am writing this review on my SP2 with type cover (which I love), but I would not even consider typing a long document on the Dell. I have answered e-mails and can enter passwords, etc. with the Dell, but any serious work would require an extra keyboard. Manipulating files and control panel data in the Dell's Desktop is doable with finger commands, but requires some discipline (I find it fairly easy, actually, but I have to take extra care).\n\nI would highly recommend this device to anyone who could benefit from access to traditional office documents and on-line references when a larger PC is not convenient. It is also fun to use as an e-reader and for playing videos!"}

I an very satisfied this tablet will do the job.\n\nWhat do I like?\n\nIE seems very fast. I have mediocre internet service, but IE has been great on this tab. Much better than our iPad 2.\n\nEmail is good with Yahoo. Haven't tried it with the work exchange server.\n\nOffice is fine, but a mouse is a must IMO.\n\nThe keyboard is good. I like the arrow keys that allow me to move the cursor around.\n\nI'm still learning metro, but I think win8.1 is actually going to work well for a hybrid tablet. Metro for tablet type play, desktop for work related stuff.\n\nI bought the 64gb model at the MS store because it was available sooner than at Amazon. I can't imagine not buying the extra memory in the digital age.\n\nLots of things I haven't tried yet. I would easily recommend this to anybody that needs both the world of work and play.\n\nI also like the case and weight.\n\nThe speed is good for basics I've done so far. Excel works ok, but I haven't pushed it. I can't think of any real negative. I knew what I was getting, so my expectations where in line with what the tab is. I'd guess that most people who dislike it wanted something it is not. Want a bigger screen, get one. A faster processor, the 11 has an i5. There are many great options to choose from. This device fits my needs exceptionally well.\n\nUPDATE:\nStill a big fan of the device.  I have a few \"cons\" to add:\n\n1)  Not a big deal, but I pick up the device with my left hand, I tend to hit the power button.  Not sure it can be avoided, but it's awkward.\n2)  Difficult to work with the desktop mode.  This is a win 8.1 thing, but it doesn't zoom in/out in desktop mode.\n3)  Double tapping certain things is awkward and doesn't seem to always recognize what you are trying to do.  This may be my \"technique\" or double tapping when I'm supposed to single tap or vice versa.\n\nThe more familiar I become with Win 8.1, the easier it is to use the tablet.  I also really like the size of this unit.  I have medium sized hands and find it pretty easy to hold and type.  I plan to get the stylus or a stylus.  I've read the early issues have been resolved and it works well now.  If a mouse isn't convenient, I would hope the stylus would help in desktop mode."}

I would say she loves it, but she's adjusting to Windows 8.1 and it's not the most intuitive OS in the world.  I think it's great.  It's light and responsive.  It feels great to hold.  It has the Atom \"Bay Trail\" processor which is x86.  So, full Windows.\n\nMinor annoyances:\nThe \"Windows\" button is where a normal tablet would have a lock button.  The lock button is on the side of the tablet.  These are dumb placements.  Only USB port is for charging.  I don't know how long the battery has been lasting for her, but she hasn't been impressed.\n\nTwo really big cons though:\n1.) A bad design choice: No HDMI.\nand\n2.) Bugs in the drivers have been causing issues with waking up from sleep.  They force my mother in law to restart it a lot.  Obviously, this is a huge problem for her.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "My wife has an iPad (3rd generation) and I have an ASUS TF300 Android tablet.  Both are great devices, but are completely limited as tablet devices (which is good for ease of use, but that comes with constraints).  For a brand new computer illiterate person, an Apple product is a great way to go.  But for those of us who have been using Windows for the last 20 years, you may have been wishing there was a device that has the best of all worlds.  This is it.\n\nI was hesitant to dive into the Surface tablet when that came out, because it did not have a normal version of Windows.  I'm still a Windows XP holdout on my home machines (desktop and laptops).  But this Dell Venue Pro tablet has a TRUE version of Windows 8.1  With a quick swipe (or button press) you have the traditional blank slate of a traditional Windows desktop, right down to the trashcan.  You can install any Windows software (that runs on 8.1) on this device.  So far it has been able to run anything I throw at it with ease.\n\nI love the Google Chrome browser, so my first download was Google Chrome.  It took about 2 minutes to download and install it.  There were no screwball \"app stores\" to deal with; I just directly downloaded the regular desktop browser version and installed it.  The beauty of this tablet is that it CAN run \"apps\" (that you download the same way you would on a phone), but you can run all of the normal Windows programs you would normally have to run on a desktop machine.  The touch controls take a few minutes to learn, but works quite well (even using browsers designed for normal desktop use).\n\nThe product comes with Microsoft Office (Excel, Word, and PowerPoint).  These aren't some lousy stripped down \"tablet lite\" versions.  They are the real deal just like you would run on your desktop.  There isn't an expiration date or trial period or a bait and switch (no Microsoft Works here); honestly, this thing is truly running MS Office, and with ease!  The only gripe I have is that you had to enter the product key from the packaging that came with the tablet, so it wasn't pre-configured, but not a big deal.  That is an incredible value, especially depending on how you plan to use this device.  Otherwise, the initial setup was a breeze.  Right off the bat there was a preinstalled Kindle app, and after one click (and entering my username and password) my entire Kindle library was availabe.  Very nice.\n\nPerformance is incredibly snappy.  Response for all screen or button presses is instant.  Loads faster than my year old Asus tablet (which I love, but it just isn't snappy at all).  The 32GB size does not have much extra space (only about 10GB free from the get-go).  But it has an expansion port for micro SD cards, so for not much money you can have plenty of expansion (already ordered by 64GB card).  The unit is well made overall.  The screen is incredibly sharp (I can't imagine needing a higher resolution; at some point it just becomes a number that is meaningless, much like the megapixel rating on a camera).\n\nThe device has the Miracast technology.  For about $25 I bought an HDMI wireless plug/dongle (like a thumb drive) that will display the image from the tablet on my TV.  So throw in a cheap Bluetooth mouse and keyboard, and you have a full featured computer on your hands.  Or you can use it to watch and stream movies on a big TV.  The possibilities are endless.\n\nThis is more machine than many users would ever use, so I still advise many friends and family members to pick up a Kindle Fire or an iPad.  But for the money if you are looking for a tablet that can truly behave like a PC, then give this little guy a try.  HIGHLY recommended!!!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I'll preface this by saying outright that the tablet is not for everyone. If you want the best tablets for gaming, absolutely pick an iPad. If you want the cheapest tablets that are no muss no fuss for your family, definitely get a Kindle Fire. If you want the cheapest tablets and know how to deal with a slightly less secure ecosystem and a bit more complexity, go with a Nexus 7 or something similar.\n\nBUT - if you want an extremely fast, extremely capable tablet that can do everything an Android tablet can, and then some, as long as you put a little bit of work into it contorting it into something it might not have meant to be, this tablet is absolutely excellent.\n\n--Build quality and such--\nThis tablet feels great, has an excellent textured back. It's definitely plastic and feels a little cheap at times, but it also gives me confidence that it'll last for a long time without issues. The only problem is that it gets a bit hot when playing games, but only in one part of the back which you generally don't touch when holding it. Hopefully it doesn't prove to be a reliability problem over time, I'll update this review if it does.\n\nThe tablet is also light enough to hold with one hand in portrait orientation for an extended period of time. Even in landscape you can, but maybe not for a long time.\n\nThe screen is a disappointing lower resolution, especially since I know the chip in this thing can push higher resolutions with ease, but it's still better than last year's iPad Mini and the quality is gorgeous outside of resolution. The DPI is high enough to comfortably allow reading in either orientation.\n\nBattery life is hit and miss. It lasts long enough for me, and this review is just my own opinion, I'm not trying to presume opinions of others. I get around 6-8 hours of battery life with the brightness turned pretty far up. The biggest problem is standby battery life, where it lasts only around 5-7 days when not using it. I expect better out of tablets these days.\n\n--Speed--\nI've extensively used the brand new Surface 2, and this tablet is noticeably faster than it at most tasks. Navigating email using the Mail app is a breeze, web pages load very quickly, side-by-side multitasking doesn't slow it down at all. Games perform \"fast enough\", but the graphics capabilities are definitely slower than the Surface 2 here.\n\nThe device is a sheer pleasure to use on the bus or the couch to just catch up on my news feeds, go through my email, and other basic tasks.\n\n--The Windows Store--\nI've actually been pleasantly surprised with how the Store has progressed. I feel like most reviewers were just left with an impression from its paltry state last year and didn't bother to check to see what's new. There's a huge host of news reader apps, and that was recently improved substantially with the inclusion of Flipboard. Feedly apps, Twitter apps, and more - I've never really found it lacking. There are plenty of great games too.\n\nFor games, I've recently discovered Zombie HQ, Asphalt 8, SoulCraft, and a bunch of others that are much higher-quality than I would have expected. Those are of course alongside the Microsoft games like Solitaire, Minesweeper, Taptiles, and others which have been there for about a year now.\n\nI've used iPhones and iPod Touches for years and years and know what a mature app ecosystem looks. If you want the latest and greatest games, iOS devices are absolutely unquestionably the way to go. It's not even a question. But if you just want a tablet that has plenty of games to choose from, even if they might not be the latest and best, the Windows Store has plenty to choose from with more arriving every day.\n\n--\"Contortion\"--\nWhile the Windows Store is improving, you're of course not limited to it on this device. You can do what I call \"contort\" the device to do pretty much anything with a little bit of patience and work. Want to plug in a 360 controller? Go right ahead! Use every Bluetooth peripheral ever made? It's a regular PC, millions of devices work without issue, and you can install literally any drivers you want. Go for it.\n\nI've installed Steam and have been digging around for good touch-supported games. There aren't that many yet unfortunately, but a few like Papers Please, Little Inferno, and Puzzle Agent are great fits. There's even a utility called GestureWorks which uses crowd-sourced button input layouts to turn non-touch games into touch-friendly games. It's still a work in progress, and will only be good for slower/turn-based games, but it shows a lot of promise.\n\nSo if you want a tablet purely for gaming, while iOS devices are the obvious choice, you can do pretty much anything with this device if you add some peripherals and utilities to get it done. There are YouTube videos online showing gaming performance if you want to get an idea of how games run - it's surprisingly good.\n\nOne other thing - the storage is limited at only 14GB left out of box on the 32GB version, but you can use an SD card for everything you want, and also move the recovery partition to a USB stick to free up an extra 5-6GB of space.\n\nSo I give this tablet a 5/5, because for me, it does what I want it to do, better than I expected, and can do so much more with a little bit of work. But that's a 5/5 with caveats since others' interests and patience might differ substantially."}

The screen is beautiful, it feels great in my hand and the things it can do compared to my android tablet is amazing! The people crying about apps are wrong windows has all the apps \"I\" want, and if not the full websites are normally better anyway. you can pin websites to the home screen and next to your other apps, in fact I removed the amazon app and pinned the website in its place. Why use a app with half the ability of the real thing. I'm most impressed with how well internet explorer functions with touch, (remember this is a full web experience not that crippled mobile stuff on other platforms), even the small desktop is easy to use.

Luckily i use the Dell Venue primarily as a tablet and use my laptop for productive tasks but this could easily replace my laptop if only i could dock it to my external monitor!\nCant charge tablet while connected to usb devices - Seriously Dell you are breaking my heart.\nThe Pen seriously needs work. Not quite wacom technology but much better than capacitive pens i suppose.\n\nThe Ugly\nThe Windows start button is in a awkward place. I still haven't gotten used to it. PLEASE add a capacitive start button on the bezel in portrait mode so when used in landscape its on either left or right side.\nGets hot sometimes when being used heavily.\nLack of good accessories. I have yet to find a good case, sleeve or smart cover that doubles as a stand that i like.\n\nOverall i love this tablet and highly recommend if you are looking for a pure tablet experience."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "When I first got it I could not type anything to set the computer up, and it would not boot until I set it up.  I had to hard reset it a few times before it became responsive.  The Dell tech support agent was insistent that a service tag was on the back of the device which it certainly is not, I think it was a Microsoft software bug because I have not had a problem sense.  They could have moved the system restore data to a micro sd card and freed up precious disk space.\n\nThe speaker is decent but there is a serous issue here, they forgot to include the second one!  It really kills the media experience, if you really had to save that last $0.75 buy nixing a speaker you could have at least positioned the remaining one top and center, instead all the sound comes from the right side which sucks on its own but it is also very annoying because that is where you often hold the device and the sound gets muffled.\n\nThe cameras are quite sub par, quality wise they are low end smartphone range.  Bad autofocus, and terrible low light performance.  No flash, when was the last time you had a cell phone without flash?  Even the slightest effort to have an led flash would have helped the camera allot.  One thing I will admit is it takes photos rapidly.  indorse the photos and video is crap but it's quite a bit better outside.  The front facing camera is off to one corner which makes you look even goofier on Skype than normal, putting it in the middle of a side would have been better.\n\nIt charges over USB, it's nice to be able to use the same charger to charge your phone.  Charge is a little slow but nothing to cry about.  A minor annoyance is that it needs a higher end charger if you don't bring the charger with you don't expect to be able to charge off a computers USB port or chargers used with many phones.  The kindle fire can be partially powered from low end USB power sources and will slowly charge from them if it is powered down, not so with the dell.  I'm being too harsh this is really only a minor thing its still amazing that a feature rich windows computer can run off 5 volts two amps while charging it's batteries.  Thanks Intel, we love you (^_^)\n\nPerformance is quite adequate for just clicking around doing word processing this won't run any real games.  A few times internet explorer has become quite irresponsive for minutes on end but each time I've opened up task manager and the issue is the lack of ram.  You only have a gig after windows loads and that can be completely expended with one word document and 5 tabs.  The processor supports 4 gigs I wish they gave you the option to buy it with four.  The only time I really get bugged by the speed itself is when I'm unzipping a file, it runs a snails pace, literally it was unzipping at 42k/s task manager had it pegged at 90% and the tablet was getting quite hot.  The zip file was only 200 megs but it took a half an hour to unzip.  The processor is 64 bit but Dell put a 32 bit copy of windows on it because windows drivers allowing it to do fast resumes and some other power management features aren't available until January.  You may be like 'so what' but 64 bit can really improve speed of things like unzipping files or improve gameplay.\n\nNO HDMI!!!  This one really burns my buttons.  It has this fake wifi screen stream crap.  Nobody has a tv that supports this laggy vaporware.  HDMI is really a nice feature that I genuinely wish I had.  Dell your big in busyness right, you really going to let Toshiba eat your lunch on this one?  Ok so I'm not doing presentations, but I do have an HDMI monitor I would like 'dock' with from time to time but primarily I want to use it to play youtubes and hulus on my tv, is that really so bad?\n\nIt came preloaded with a bunch of crapware, like a \"dell sync\" service thing where you pay dell to 'backup' all your sensitive documents so the NSA can sniff through them.  It's allot harder to clear that stuff out these days.\n\nI really wish dell went with a full size sd card, sdxc is up to 256 gb per card, microsd is a quarter of that and at much slower speeds.  Instead they have a bunch of space carved out for sim cards.  Nobody wants to sign up for $30 a month to get 2gb of internet on a tablet.  We all have cellphones that thether, if we want internets we just share it from our phones, much cheaper that way.\n\nAll in all I think Dell was aiming for the cheapest device they could build features be dammed.  If I where to do it over I would go with the Toshiba Encore, it has much better cameras, two speakers, HDMI output and it has GPS which is awesome if it ever gets lost or stolen you can track it down.  It costs 10% more but your getting 10% more out of it.\n\nVenue 11 pro looks nice though."}

Coming from an Acer W3, this tablet is MUCH snappier, more responsive, and of course, has a significantly better display. It's also really thin and has the smallest overall dimensions of any Windoes 8 tablets (non RT) on the market today (11/14/2013).\n\nUnfortunately i had to return it because I wasn't able to get the tablet to charge while having peripherals plugged in using a USB hub. Dell told me it was possible, and I tried just about everything.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "First of all I want to be fair in stating that I work in Technology and have very high expectations.  I have had pretty much every pad made from the larger manufacturers.  I have never purchased one of the 99.99 devices that are out there.\n\nI gave up my Surface RT a year ago due to the fact it is worthless without the ability to install applications.  I have been using a Nexus 7 G1 since then and it has been my favorite pad to date with the exception of NO rear camera.\n\nI was very excited to the Venue 8 Pro with full Windows 8.1 - this would allow me to use the device with the software installed that I need to do my daily functions.\n\nThe Device feels as a quality device, and I will leave it at that.  I'm going to focus on the functionality of the device.\n\nI if you are going to get this device you need to get a keyboard, mouse for the device.  Dell's bt keyboard is still not available so I have ordered a Microsoft Arc.  Using the windows applications without is next to impossible.  Not to mention the size of the screen.  All of this is to be expected.  I do look forward to obtaining the stylus from Dell which I have ordered as well.\n\nI have had constant wireless connection issues with this device.  Very annoying.  I have updated the bios to no avail and have twice uninstalled the wireless adapter and reinstall (software uninstall not physical uninstall)  It appears to be working properly, but we shall see.\n\nThe battery life for me has only been 4 to 6 hours and this is NOT use time.  It may be due to the generic case that it is in, but I will pay closer attention today.  The past two days it has been completely dead after sitting in my laptop bag.\n\nI am pleased with the speed of the unit and how it handles applications.  I have Office Business installed and use Outlook.  It does a great job handling all of my email and PowerPoints.  It does a great job switching between applications.\n\nThe windows key location does take some getting used to , but I can understand why they put it there.\n\nIf I get the battery issue resolved I will update this review.\n\nI'm still having battery issues with this device.  I am now simply in the habit of turning the unit off when it is not in use.  I purposely fully charged the unit yesterday, unplugged and let it sleep over the evening.  When checking the battery level this morning I was down to 36 percent, which I was not happy with.\n\nI am still having wireless and bluetooth issues.  I received my MS Wedge Keyboard yesterday and configured with the unit.  The only way to get the pad to connect was to reboot the machine.  Simple thing but annoying none the less and most users would not think to do that.  The keyboard is great by the way and I will be giving the Wedge Keyboard a 5 Star review.  I will update this further as the journey progresses\n\nUpdate - I had to return the unit - the battery life simply was not acceptable.  I'm not sure if it was a bad unit or not.  I will stick with my Droid Pad for now and let them get the kinks out of this device."}

Else, I would have either bought a different tablet or a micro-SD card over the SDHC one I burned $30 on.\n\nUpdate to 1 star: I really tried to enjoy the tablet. I actually started enjoying it a little bit, I started doing my computer programming lessons on it, browsing the net. Things were going well, I overlooked issues I previously had. I bought a micro-SD card that was compatible with the tablet. However, now it's hung up on a Windows update. I put it on the charger last night while it was shutting down and updating so now it's on a completely full battery. So now I have to wait about 2 or so days so that the battery can run out because it won't let me shut it down. The screen keeps turning off further slowing the battery consumption. Great."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "The short story - Great screen. Size, grip, and weight are perfect for what I was looking for. Price is right but I was looking for more of a \"swiss army knife\" tablet. I think Dell did a fine job getting this out there but I was disappointed that it didn't have a micro hdmi port. GPS would have been nice also. I am going to return this and get the android version. Hopefully the next revision will have micro-HDMI and GPS. This device just fell short of what I was looking (hoping) for.\n\nThe longer story - I would have given this a 3.5 star rating if I could but I can't see giving it a 4. I think the biggest issue for me was there is no micro hdmi. I don't know how much weight and size this would have added but the additional functionality would have been a huge benefit for me personally. I was looking for something portable I could use for travelling (work and leisure) and something I could carry back and forth to the office. HDMI would have allowed me to hook it up and use it as a desktop in a spare port with one of my existing monitors at work. With a USB keyboard and mouse this would have been an awesome product. The screen is nice enough that when it wasn't hooked up it would still be functional. For me 7 inch is too small and 10 inch is generally to heavy to use as a reader, 8 inch is perfect. The funny thing is when I was looking into this device I thought it had a HDMI, I actually assumed it had one. It wasn't until after I have put the order in for one that I read elsewhere it did not. After finding out it didn't have HDMI I bought a MHL to HDMI adapter (pretty cheap...mine cost ~10.00) hoping this would work. Unfortunately Dell decided not to support this feature either. There is a solution out there for an universal docking station but the cheapest one is ~80 and that was the deciding factor to send this back.\n\nI would also take a half a star off for not having a GPS. This to me isn't too big a deal. I actually have a bluetooth GPS that I connected to the Dell. It took about 15 minutes to get it working but once I did and started to fiddle around with it I found there really isn't too much you can do with it after all. Windows 8.1 isn't like Android. The applications and operating system aren't geared towards location-centric functionality that Android devices are. I think as Win 8 matures as a mobile OS this will change.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I am still on the fence with a Microsoft based mobile solution. This device nearly made me move away from Android but the lack of micro HDMI was the deal killer. I would prefer to hang on to Android for one more year until something like this comes out in this size and weight that has the ability to hook into a monitor. Seems like Dell missed an opportunity by not adding HDMI and Microsoft is still playing catch-up."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "Tablets I have owned include an Android Pandigital, Kindle Fire, Acer W500 now running Windows 8.1 and two Asus RT tablets. The Asus tablets are still running Windows 8.0 because the 8.1 RT upgrade kills the camera flash and makes Bluetooth audio stutter. Neither Microsoft nor Asus have addressed either issue. I have tested other tablets including the Acer W510 and HP Envy 2.\n\nI was happy to see the Dell Pro 8 build quality meets the high expectations set by other reviews. I was less happy with the weight and thickness of the device. I can comfortably hold my svelte 10 inch Asus RT for longer periods than the more brick like Dell. The Asus is very thin and light given the size. The Dell feels more like the older and heavier Kindle Fire. That said, weight and thickness are not overwhelming distractions.\n\nThe screen is nice but does not wow me as much as it does other reviewers. Sound is good and the touch screen responsive. I have no real issues using the touch desktop. I have a theory that skin physiology, as in the body electric, has an effect on touch accuracy between individuals. I rarely have issues with touch screen input on any device.\n\nThe internal microphone is good enough to use the free Speech to Text software to control applications and to dictate. After a short training session and addition of an external headset, dictation accuracy improved considerably. The Dell is a close second to the Asus RT in, out of the box, suitability for speech to text control.\n\nOne of the reasons I like RT and my Chromebook is the greater immunity to viruses and Trojans offered by these operating systems. Within an hour of simply surfing, Microsoft flagged and quarantined a sever Trojan acquired when visiting a well-known tech review site. This site is not hidden in the dark recesses of the internet but one often visited by technology consumers. I feel much more vulnerable using Windows 8. Windows RT and Chrome trade functionality for greater security.\n\nI often use my Bluetooth LG 700 headset to listen to streamed music and while watching videos. One of the first things I check with any new tablet is Bluetooth audio. At first audio streamed without issue. After a few lengthy updates, BT audio was interrupted with micro-pauses. My other Bluetooth devices seemed to work better but the LG 700 is by far my favorite headset and I was about to return the Dell.\n\nI finally clicked the My Dell tile on the Start Page and was taken to the Dell support page. I upgraded the bios as recommended (always makes me sweat when fiddling with the bios.) After the bios update, LG 700 audio worked with only one wee pause while playing over seven tunes. I also updated Wi-Fi and Bluetooth drivers but believe the bios upgrade may have fixed my Bluetooth issues.\n\nWe plan to order a Miracast interface to test the advertised wireless video/audio streaming. Will update my review once tested.\n\nI have noticed one bug reported by others. When I have the device in landscape orientation before turning on, the display often skips from the picture sign in to a dark blank screen. I am forced to hold the power button in for 5 - 10 seconds to turn the device off and log in again. If this is not fixed in a future update, I may return the device. I believe the Dell deserves a solid four star rating, but after reading the many negative comments about Dell support, I hope I never need to contact Dell for assistance.\n\nUPDATE: Bios and driver updates did not correct audio Bluetooth issues. System still occasionally goes to black screen when booted. Halo Spartan will not scale to the screen, making it unplayable. Microsoft does not warn store customers of this issue!\n\nStreamed music when using the Bluetooth LG 700 and LG 730 headsets is unreliable. In stark contrast, no skips or pauses are noted when connected to my Asus RT 8.0 tablet, Nokia Windows 8 phone, or Acer W500 running 8.1 windows. The Dell bios update helped but just as I begin to relax and enjoy the music it pauses or skips. Bluetooth issues, occasional boot to a black screen rather than Start Screen and uncertainty Metro apps will scale properly (example: Halo Spartan) are forcing me to return the tablet."}

I actually received it a day early and I ordered it through the pre-order page that I just happened to run across. $328.99 was a good deal.  Amazon has removed the pre-order price since then.\n\nI have no cons for the tablet, but the Active Stylus & the Tablet Folio from Dell were way over priced.  Especially the Folio.  It's plastic for crying out loud!  I really feel cheated by Dell on that item.  It was $39.99!  I ordered the stylus for $34.99 through Dell and found that the tip slides out of the stylus and can be easily lost if you're not careful.  It works fine so far so I think I'll just glue it in place with a removable rubber type cement.\n\nI guess they got even on the pre-order deal! :^(\n\nThis tablet is amazing and I predict that Windows 8 tablets are going to drive android tablets to rock bottom prices.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "After using the Samsung 500T for over a year I can really appreciate the size, weight and processor speed of the Venue 8 Pro.  The screen is excellent and bright after turning the auto brightness option off.  Great for reading books, watching videos and running my favorite software and the Windows App store has plenty of great Apps if you are into that stuff (which I find too time wasting).  Answering Email on this size screen is excellent because typing in portrait mode is a breeze with the keys being so close for your thumbs.  I have the active stylus and the Dell case which is nice but does add some weight.  The stylus is great for running Windows desktop apps and handwriting but is not as accurate as the S-Pen and watcom digitizer in the Samsung tablet,  I would say that the stylus needs improvement or a software driver to improve accuracy, which is fine for most work and a must for running desktop apps with older menus and icons.  Integration with a Windows 8 phone is incredible, saves a tremendous amount of time, your calendar, email, contacts, etc are all right there and skydrive connects your important files and photos. I also use my tablet to score basketball and football games with a product called TurboStats which is really outstanding on this device. For any program that requires a lot of data entry, the active stylus is a must.  The Windows button in on the side of the device instead of under the screen which I kind of like because you don't hit it by accident and you really don't need it with Windows 8.1.  I would love the option to instead use the Windows button to pop up the keyboard in the Desktop mode because I like to autohide the taskbar at the bottom or even to have the Windows button popup the taskbar when you need it (not sure if this is possible to set).  Overall I really love this tablet because it makes my life easier and it's only $299.  A wacom digitizer with place to store the pen, HDMI out and another USB port would be my recommended upgrades even if it added another $50."}

Get a stylus and bluetooth keyboard on your way out. End of Review.\n\nIf you however want a tablet that behaves similar to your phone then this may not be what you want.\n\nIt doesn't have the sort of stand-by per say that you can expect from a phone where it's really awake but using very little battery, great for playing a podcast or music in the background.\n\nInstead it has a fully suspended ultra-fast power on, so either you set a blank screen saver or you click the lock button and the device powers off killing your playback. It resume works so well that youtube videos will even resume properly after keeping the device off for quite a while.\n\nTo be honest the power settings seem kind of restrictive for a device with a battery, Windows OS was obviously designed with the legacy idea that you have to prepare to lose power any time you unplug it. When you compare it to Android or iOS.\n\nIt's actually quite nice to have a fully running Foobar2000 or Clementine media player running, a *real* VLC/Media Player, but I haven't really found an awesome podcaster with with an increased playback speed option.\n\nI imagine getting a gps pc app won't be as easy but I haven't tried.\n\nIf you plan on using this with 1 hand, good luck. Hopefully the program your using is designed well or else you'll really need the stylus to help grab the corners to resize windows.\n\nThe handwriting recognition coming from the keyboard accessible from the status bar on the bottom right is quite amazing. My handwriting is bad, really bad, I'm not sure if I could have read that looking at some of these scribbles but this tablet picks it up with what I can only assume is NLP (Natural Language Processing) [Thanks Chomsky!] assistance. If you do get a single character or so off then the recognition seems to break down because your off the dictionary so your better off erasing the whole word half the time even though they have commands to split and join and edit single characters etc..\n\nThe handwriting recognition is half the reason I got the tablet, I felt my handwriting has been slipping for some time and this seemed like a good way to take natural notes and work on my handwriting. In this regard this has been pretty good, if not great.\n\nAlso, I ordered this from Dell and spoke with 2 different salesmen and the interactive chat and all 3 of them confirmed the existence of a cell GSM/LTE/// card, ALL LIES. The documentation shows where such a card could exist ... one day? But to be fair if all you saw was the documentation you'd think it had a SIM slot too, I was certainly confused when the slot on the documentation turned out to be a flat piece of plastic.\n\nIf you even go to the Dell website and to the Venue Pro 8 main screen then click on the \"Tech Specs\" you'll see \"Wireless WAN Dell Wireless 5808E (3G / HSPA) Mobile Broadband Card and Dell Wireless 5570E (LTE/HSPA/EVDO) Mobile Broadband Card (US Only)\" ALL LIES. The BIOS confirms no cell card and the windows hardware manager.\n\nSo overall? Good device, horrible company, definitely not for everyone.\n\nEdit 12/9/13:\n\nMore time, more urgent updates applied.\n\nI found out that if you let \"Music\" do your audio playback it *will* play after clicking the standby button, so it appears to go into a normal standby but no other music player I've tried seems to copy this feat.\n\nThe Dell stylus continues to suck (1 star), the AAAA battery seems to have died already. The three buttons (top, middle, bottom) are undocumented and good luck getting them to work consistently. I did get a free passive stylus with a rubber tip and that actually works much better than the Dell one designed for this tablet. Also, no more erratic hover clicking as a result!\n\nFinally, I tried out a random cheapo Bluetooth keyboard, it works well very well. But I think I'll end up getting the Dell one that doubles as a screen protector, they can't screw that up too, right?"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "A tablet that is right sized. A tablet that has just the right mixture of hardware components. You can almost feel the power of the Intel Atom Baytrail series with the touch of this device. Unlike its Apple counterpart, the price is also right. Perhaps there is a reason why they call it Air. It is on top of the sky in terms of price. The Dell Venue 8 pro maybe cheaper, but it does what a tablet should. It comes with Windows 8.1 to my surprise, a brilliant OS for an 8 inch tablet. Many people complain about using the Windows 8 desktop interface on a small inch screen. I have yet to find what is distasteful about it. The desktop and the new metro experience both work well on the Dell Venue 8 pro. Perhaps it is just my personal preference. Nevertheless, the Dell Venue 8 pro has everything right.\n\nExcept for one...\nthe stylus that comes with it if you choose to buy the case + stylus altogether with the tablet. So why does this product deserve a 5 star? My experience with their customer service was satisfying. At first, everyone had the infamous trailing ink problem. The stylus will leave dotted trails making it hard for you to write or draw. They recently updated the firmwire or the OS and now writing with the stylus is a great experience. Unfortunately, that experience didn't last very long when my stylus became defective. My stylus became sort of like a dry paint brush - the lines never connect. I could write better with my finger than I did with my stylus. When I called the customer service, they immediately shipped a replacement with 1 day shipping. All I had to do was return the defective stylus with pre-paid delivery stamp given by them. That is why this product deserves a 5 star."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "Alright, let me give a very simple straight review base on my short ownership of the 32gb version.\n\nPros:\n1. Build quality is decent for a $300 tablet, better than the Nexus 7 2013 version and Samsung Galaxy Note 8 in my opinion.\n\n2. The ability to run PC applications and some old PC games (of course only playable with keyboard and mice).\n\n3. Screen size is nearly perfect, can fit in jeans back pocket-a more portable alternate to a laptop.\n\n4. Price is very fair in contrast to some expensive self-claimed premium products made by Foxconn slave factory.\n\n5. The last one is to Dell. They immediately issued a full refund after I returned the tablet.\n\nCons:\n\n1. Some serious bugs found. Personally I encountered some serious bugs while using it, not sure whether only mine is defective. For examples:\n  A.The OS frequently refused to turn on Wi-fi upon request. Sometimes a reboot could temporarily solve this issue.\n  B.20%30% chance the OS would fail to wake up after turning off/locking the screen (No response by clicking power button).After I gave up trying for 15-20 minutes, the OS automatically reboot, or I have to reboot manually.\n  C.While playing youtube videos on Google chrome browser,if I click the \"skip ad\" button, the video window will turn black while the ad and the video still playing the sound.(IE seems does not have such problem).\nI'm not a paid Dell engineer so I do not have the duty to find out the solutions.\n\n2. The screen, 1280x800 189dpi screen is Ok but not good enough because I got used to read books on my 323dpi nexus4. You probably will not notice the difference if you are reading some typical downloaded novel books with large font letters. However if you are reading small-font high word density books such as PDF version of letter-size textbooks, the words are only recognizable, not sharp at all.\n\n3. It would be difficult to accurately touch the tiny icons of some application interface, especially if you have big fingers.\n\n4. Overpriced official accessories. In order to use the Microsoft Office software for serious purpose you really need stylus and Bluetooth keyboard. But if I have to purchase these overpriced accessories to make it works, it would be no longer a budget windows 8.1 tablet, isn't it? I could get similar productivity on a cheaper android tablet with Kingsoft office installed.\n\nAnd also,only saying how good the product will not help Dell improve in the future. We have enough braindead fanboys in this world."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "A perfect tool for those who have always loved Kindle but they were missing many crucial PC functions in it. I cannot say enough good words about this device: its handy size, its slim yet very sturdy design, its amazing screen, its speed and an absolute winner: its battery (apparently thanks to Intel's Bay Trail processor).\nI am one of those who were never happy with the basic Kindle devices because I was missing full PC tablet features: SD card, MS Office, two cameras, a real internet browser, full email with attachments, flash player, Windows Silverlight to mention just a few.\nI am absolutely not saying that it is a Kindle replacement. I am just one of those people who do not carry with them too many portable devices: a smartphone, a Kindle and a tablet or a laptop. And although Kindle app is just an app, it has everything what I would need my kindle for: storing and reading books and having an access to my Kindle library.\n\nI will save your time because many other reviewers pointed out its PROS. To me, if any product on Amazon has more than 50 reviews and its score is well above 4 stars, it simply means I cannot be disappointed.\n\nI had a chance to try Asus T100 which I ...returned. You will find my review of it also on amazon. http://www.amazon.com/review/RK37FZMX5V1YC/ref=cm_cr_notf_fhv_prd\nI can only say that comparing those two PC Tablets is like comparing Impala with Mustang. And Dell is the latter one:-)"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I have the 64GB version of the Dell Venue 8 Pro.  I have had this device for a few days now. I absolutely love it. I had an Acer Iconia W3-810 previously. The Venue 8 is lighter, has a more solid build, and the screen is far superior.  This has Windows 8.1 out of the box so the Windows 8 Desktop apps work smoothly on it. The Venue Pro is very similar to the Lenovo MIIX 2. It is almost a toss up for me. The distinguishing factor for me is the support. Dell customer service has been more consumer friendly than Lenovo. I have not had a chance to see the Toshiba Encore though.\n\nI use this device for media consumption ( videos, movies, games), email, and for productivity.  I love being able to load a document at work onto Skydrive and pull it down to my tablet to work on.\n\nI know a big knock on Windows tablets is the lack of a large ecosystem. It is true that Windows doesn't have all of the major apps, but they have Facebook, Twitter, Netflix,and pretty comparable appsf or Instagram, Flipboard, and Waze.  Instapin is a great Instagram hold over until the real one comes in late November.\n\nThe Xbox movie and game store is awesome. Halo Spartan Assault is almost reason to get a windows tablet. I am happy with the selection of Apps, movies, and games available. The Venue Pro has a very solid feel and if you like reading books the IPS screen is great for rooms with low light or natural light. It does have a minor glare reading in direct sunlight. Get the kindle app for e-books or the Nook app if you read magazines. I can hold this device in one hand for a good 2 hours before my hand starts fatiguing.\n\nThe Venue 8 pro does not have a USB port, but does have a micro USB. If you buy the little connector for micro to USB you can connect an external hardrive or other USB device to it.\n\nIf you are bored with apple, and frustrated with the instability of Android, then get the Venue 8 Pro. It has the stability of an Apple OS, but the functionality of Windows. It is the best of both worlds."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "Its a 8\" tablet weighing less than the iPad mini but runs Full Windows 8.1, how cool is that? This is what I have been wanting for a long long time - a tablet that lets me consume content, and when I don't have access to a regular PC, it will let me do some actual work! And full Windows means - you can run any windows application, get multiple user profiles and the whole shebang!\n\nOrdered from Amazon for $252.65 on Nov. 3rd and got it Nov 5th - Amazon Prime rocks!\n\nComes in a slim plastic body that actually feels and looks quite good, has the spiraled textured back which provides an excellent grip. 1 micro-SD card slot and 1 micro-USB port. No Sim Card slot. A mono but adequate speaker - if you want stereo you will have to plug in a headphone/external/Bluetooth speaker. In the box you will get a charger and a USB/micro-USB Cable - that's it.\n\nCold booting to Windows takes about 10 seconds. updated the BIOS - took about 8 minutes. Ran Windows updates - about 200MB. Installed some apps - Evernote touch, dropbox, kindle... watched YouTube, Hulu, amazon prime and Netflix, read some PDFs - I have to say the metro PDF viewer really shines in tablet form factor. Next Morning, I decided it was a keeper and ordered an OTG Cable, Micro-SD Card and the Stylus from Dell. I haven't run any intensive applications on it, but the maximum I was able to push it was up to 89% memory use. I was little concerned about the 2GB memory and the eMMC storage. But after I ran passmark PC performance test, it appeared this thing was performing on par with the low end 65W TDP CPU s - like a core 2 duo or a mobile core i3 even, and this is only a 5W CPU, I have to say, hats off to Intel! Way better than the Eee PCs - with which we mostly associate the Atom CPU s. you can see a screenshot of my passmark results. Crystal Diskmark revealed pretty impressive disk performance - I only hope that it will last past the warranty period. Next I wanted to see how it performed compared to other \"tablets\" on the market. So, I ran geekbench 3, and here are the results and some comparison -\n\nGeekbench 3 Results -\n\nDevice  Single Core  Multi Core\nDell Venue Pro 8 789  2525\nAsus Nexus 7  622  1891\niPad mini  262  498\niPad 4th Gen  784  1427\nGalaxy Note 10.1 392  1073\nAmazon Kindle Fire 337  614\nAcer Iconia W3  437  1106\n\nNeedless to say, This little beauty performs exceptionally well.\n\nBefore I knew it, my OTG cable and micro-SD cards were here. The micro-USB port is used to charge the battery and also works as a USB host with a USB OTG cable. It does not function as mtp. Downside to this dual purpose port is that you can't charge and connect to peripherals simultaneously. could not successfully power a regular portable USB drive or slim DVD drive, But it detects an USB keyboard just fine and you can get to the BIOS. One other thing i tried was a generic USB Ethernet adapter and it worked! You can boot from a Retail Windows 8.1 USB Stick, but that's as far as you will be able to go, Dell hasn't made available the touch screen drivers.\n\nAfter getting the cable, I moved the recovery partition to a thumb drive (you need a minimum of 8GB), deleted the recovery partition, and ran disk cleanup - at this point I had a total of 17.5GB out of 27.9GB free - plus the 32GB on the micro-SD card, I think i will survive. pretty much anything video, audio, pdf etc all opens and runs just fine from the sd card.\nA lot of people have complained about the automatic display settings, but it was a bit too bright for my taste when i turned the auto brightness off. Ran the Windows battery report, since i have used it for a few days now. It appears it got almost 10 hours of full use, you can see the screenshot of that report.\n\nDell really screwed up the shipping for my stylus, delayed it twice. I am not an artist, nor have ever used any active stylus extensively. This appeared to work reasonably well for me in One Note and Windows Journal, with some occasional slipping of the pen or a bit of a too much sensitivity. This is one thing I am not too thrilled about in general about the touch screen of this device - its just a bit too much touchy at times, a single key touch will get 2,3 letters and sometime the zooming in/out and scrolling tends to slip too. I don't know what kind of glass they are using, its not listed in Corning Gorilla Glass site.\n\nAfter almost a week of using this tablet, I am beginning to wonder why Microsoft had to take almost a Billion dollars write off on the Surface RT? Windows 8 is actually a pretty good OS, the Metro UI is much better than anything out there - IMHO, including IOS (I own a 1st & 3rd gen iPad) and of Course Android. I think they should have kept the RT limited to just Metro, and for the Desktop part, they could have put in an option to selectively turn on the touch friendly Metro UI only if the PC detected that it has a touch screen - or something like that. That way people would be much less confused. The 2 UIs and the sudden loss of the familiar start button has been a pretty big shock for the users. Maybe they didn't foresee Intel being able to make a 5W x86 processor that's almost as good as a desktop CPU? if Intel continues like this, maybe in a few years our smart phones will be x86 instead of ARM? that will be fun!\n\nUpdate 12/23/2013\nLike a lot of other folks, at the beginning I thought why on earth would Dell put the Windows button like that on the side in the Venue Pro 8? Well after using the Venue 11 Pro, I think I like the placement of the Windows button much better on the Venue Pro 8. The capacitive Windows button interferes too much specially if you are trying to use the Pen in landscape mode."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "Was really interested in the Lenovo Miix 2, Acer W4, Toshiba Encore (the latter two have mini HDMI).  Dell is first out the gate and I don't regret not waiting to try out the others.  It's a full blown Windows 8.1 PC that fits in my pocket.  It feels like a quality piece, tastefully and simply designed with a grippy back and sparse ornamentation.  I actually like that the windows button is on the top left edge in landscape mode, making it less likely to be activated accidentally if it were left on the bezel. This layout also leaves the bezel completely unadorned with no branding, only a full Windows 8.1 experience.  It's location on the Charms swipe area and the bottom left in Windows 8.1 make a physical button superfluous anyway.\nI love my iPad mini (great consumption, play device) and my Surface Pro (serious work device).  The Venue 8 Pro combines the best of both with few of the compromises.  It's no speed demon but it's run all of the necessary work and productivity software that I need (full MS Office, Acrobat, light Photoshop).  It's reasonably quick, I never even sense any type of lag.  The quad core atom is that good.  I'm blown away by the speed.\nThis tablet is actually replacing my Surface Pro as my travel PC...the Surface Pro is powerful but is a little over 2 lb...relatively light but not \"one-handed tablet\" light. Tablet form factor also means I don't have to pull it out for security checkpoints at airports for my frequent travels.\nScreen is bright and crisp (as long as auto brightness is turned off, as others have mentioned).  64GB is an adequate amount (also using a 64GB micro SD card to hold documents and stuff, for roughly 128GB total).\nA full size USB and HDMI would have made it perfect but so far I have dropbox/G Drive to share files and an OTG adapter for when I need to use a full-size USB key.  And those are niggles anyway, this is a relatively cheap $300 tablet, not a $1000 ultrabook yet compares very favorably to the latter.  Paired easily with my MS Wedge bluetooth keyboard and logitech slim mouse and it's a mini workstation.  Battery life has been phenomenal.  Ordered Friday morning (during a brief sale) and it was delivered Monday morning, two day prime shipping.  Kudos to Amazon.\nFor portability, capability, price the Venue 8 Pro is tough to beat."}

For the price there's not a better tablet. Bay Trail processor a big improvement over Clovertrail much zippier. Camera's are pretty decent outdoors for both pics and videos, not that I'd use it for these purposes that often, but if I had to not a bad option. A lot of things come down to whether you like Windows 8.1, definite improvement over 8 but still needs some tweaking. Yes we all know about the lack of apps but most of the apps I need are available, just need a Google+ app and I'm pretty much set. Things like having the virtual keyboard automatically come up in desktop mode and metro version file explorer would be nice updates. Built-in apps work fine for me for playing video, playing music, viewing pics, mail etc. Windows 8 works for me because most of my world is Windows based so it's nice to be able to run legacy apps. Another improvement I'd like to see is better touch performance in desktop mode, it's usable but needs work. Otherwise as far as hardware goes, well built, light in the hands and I like the 16:10 screen ratio which is great for ebooks when reading in portrait mode. At first I was bit disappointed when hearing it was \"only\" going to be 1280x800 resolution but looks good, very sharp text. A couple things hardware-wise I wish it had and seems like it could have would be separate port for charging as opposed to using the micro-usb port. Also a micro HDMI port would have been nice, no way of projecting to a bigger screen. Otherwise if you've been using Windows 8, a great add to your collection."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I have the 64GB version, which I actually bought off the Dell web site instead of Amazon.  It did take a while to arrive (about 3 weeks), but this review isn't about Dell's marketplace. :)\n\nI've had the Venue Pro 8 for a few days now and have gotten in a decent amount of both play time and work time.  I want to preface this, by saying that I've been through the following tablets over the past couple of years - 1st gen iPad, 3rd gen iPad, iPad mini, Kindle Fire, Nook HD, Samsung Galaxy tab, Surface RT, and Asus VivoTab RT. Up until I bought the Venue Pro 8, I was using the Surface RT as my primary tablet. My kids play their games on the iPads, and I honestly haven't touched them for several months, except to install updates.\n\nThe thing that has always frustrated me about tablets is that they are great for consumption of content - books, videos, games, but awful for getting actual work done. And for a guy that works 60+ hour weeks and spends 4 months out of the year travelling, it sucks trying to do work on tablets.  The Venue Pro 8, however, is the full version of Windows 8.  I have the full version of Microsoft Office 2013 on here, Visio and Project (which are critical to my job), as well as other apps that I use, such as Mindjet MindManager, and MineCraft :)  This tablet is literally a full PC in a tablet's body. The battery life is compares to other tablets.  I'm tracking around 10 hours of use so far.  It's turns on and off as quickly as any other tablet.\n\nLast night, I was watching TV with the Dell Venue Pro 8 on the couch next to me, and during the commercials, I picked it up to check up on a couple of blogs and play a couple levels of some casual games.  This morning, I turned on my Bluetooth Microsoft Wedge Keyboard and Wedge Mouse, and went out to Starbucks to work for the morning.  My laptop stayed in my bag, and I only used the Venue Pro 8 - checking email, working on a Word doc, taking a conference call on Lync, etc. Yes, the screen is a little small for working on it non-stop, but the resolution is very good and you can compensate for the screen size by adjusting the font sizes in Windows.  I haven't had any issues working from the tablet for lengthy periods of time.\n\nI two have two issues, though.  The first is the pen. I bought the pen and case combo from Dell, and the pen holder is situated along the right side of the case, when it's being held vertically. Because of this, the pen is close enough to the screen that it deactivates the touch input. This is really annoying, so I stopped carrying the pen in the case. Instead, I put the pen in my pocket. Then the other day, I took it out of my pocket to use it, and I noticed that the tip of the pen had broken off. That was a bit frustrating since the pen was $35.\n\nThe second issue is with the case. It's a pretty nice case, but it's bulky and the tablet is tough to get out of it once it's in. When I'm using the case, it feels like the tablet is bulky and thick. When I take it out, it feels slim and light, so I prefer to use it out of the case.  So my recommendation is that if you buy this tablet, don't spend the money on the case and stylus - instead take the money and buy a Wedge Keyboard and Mouse - it makes it a lot more usable.\n\nThe last thing I'll say is that I saw a video on YouTube of a guy who hooked up the Venue Pro 8 up to a couple of monitors to use it like a PC.  I haven't done that yet, but I did buy a Male B to Female A USB cable in order to do this.  Once that arrives, I'm going to plug this into my USB docking station and try running this tablet as my primary PC.\n\nOverall, this is the best tablet I've used to date.  It really makes Windows shine and makes me more of a believer in the Microsoft vision -"}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I have been spending time with my new Venue 8 Pro for the past 4 days.  Please understand that, prior to this, I've experienced the Acer Iconia W510 (10.1 screen, 32GB) and the Lenovo IdeaTab Lynx (11.6 screen, 64GB), both of which were originally released as Windows 8 Tablets, first generation.  I own them both and recently updated them to Windows 8.1.  So, much of what I have to say is relative to my experience with those two devices.  I also own multiple Android tablets of both 7 (including Nexus 7, both 2012 and 2013 eds.), and 10.1 screen sizes, and Ipad 3rd Gen, Ipod touch, etc.  I'm an enthusiast of new touch screen technology devices and computing in general.\n\n  My first disappointment happened while I was filling text spaces during Windows 8.1 set-up on the Dell Venue 8 Pro:  the slightest or firmest screen tap resulted in multiple character outputs.  So, if I wanted an r, I'd get  mostly rr or rrr, etc.  I figured it would be simply something that would sort itself out after whatever Windows and Dell updates were pending.  We're all familiar with the first set of drivers usually requiring updating, even right after initial release.  Unfortunately, the issue not only persisted even after doing the required updates, but became worse, despite my fiddling with Keyboard and Pen and Touch settings under Control Panel.  None of those settings is clearly meant to address screen sensitivity per se, so it was like walking in the dark to see where one gets, if anywhere.  Unfortunately, I wasn't getting anywhere useful.  Much to my surprise, I allowed myself to contact Dell Support via Chat functionality on My Dell app (via Metro screen; not exactly reachable via windows desktop mode).  The tech person I got had a positive-outcome mentality, which I found very helpful.  He accessed the tablet remotely via an app download whose link he sent me during the chat.  As he worked on the issue, I noticed he was fiddling with the same settings I had tried to adjust before.  Since none of it bore any fruit, he suggested he could refresh (as opposed to reset) the device, to which I agreed.  This sort of resets the tablet's settings but preserves most, if not all, of one's stored files, such as downloads, etc; some installs are removed, including any programs and updates that change any original important settings.\n\n  When the tablet rebooted, it was evident that the hypersensitive screen problem was still there.  The tech had said he would call me later but I had to run some errands, so he did call but I wasn't home to receive the message, which I have yet to retrieve.  My experience with OS-related issues has usually been that one is dependent on updates and drivers issued by Microsoft and the manufacturer.  Any additional adjustment is usually up to me to try.  Just as I was almost realizing that I was seemingly stuck with a defective unit, I read again all of Amazon's reviewsthey've been accumulating at a fast pace over the past days.  One or two reviewers mention something akin to what I've been describing regarding repetitive output but it doesn't seem they've necessarily experienced it to the same degree I have.\n\n  The other thing I noticed was that right after having finished doing the Windows and Dell updates, the storage space was about 12.4gb, consistent with other people's observations.  After the refresh, however, space had decreased to about 8.4gb.  My Acer Iconia W510 has shown this kind of behavior before and, after the tablet does some periodic Maintenance on its own (the msg flag shows a clock icon) it regains space, so that it's been known to go from about 9gb to 12.4 gb.  So I compared both devices storage-wise.  It turns out that, while Acer opted to omit a recovery partition out of consideration for how limited a space one is left with after all is said and done on a 32gb Windows tablet, Dell did not omit the recovery partition, which by my estimate is occupying some 4-5gb of space.  I did run Maintenance manually on the Dellie chose for the device to do it at a time I wanted it to happen and, almost predictably, space went up to about 9.6.  At times it shows 9.5 or 9.4gb, so apparently, space is left in some kind of dynamic state.  By the way, this is after having installed the bare minimum Windows programs I can't be without, things like an antimalware utility, an explorer-like program, Sumatra PDF reader, and VLC media player, and also having updated all apps on the Metro side which Windows indicated were in need of updating, about 28 in total.  I did that in about 3-4 app groups.  Some apps took less space than their out-of-box versions, some took a tiny bit more.  The total of about 9.5gb after updates and installs is apparently the best one can do under the circumstances.  If you add to that the 4-5gb presumably occupied by recovery, it comes out to about 13gb, which is consistent with what my Acer tablet shows, which has essentially the same apps and programs.  Considering that the touch input capability came in half-cooked shape out of the box, it was probably a good idea for Dell to leave the recovery partition in place.  I assume that's what actually makes a refresh possible, or even a reset, should one opt for that more drastic measure.\n\n  Now, the really most interesting observation after the Maintenance is that the touch input problem decreased to about 25% of what it used to be.  I can now tap-write several a few sentences without it happening, or it happening only once every so often.  So much so, that now I can see myself keeping the tablet under the basic assumption that the remainder of the issue may be addressed in time via Dell and/or Microsoft OS or driver updates.  How this happened, I'm not sure.  Maybe there's a virtual device taking care of some aspect somewhere, or something was done to the drivers during the maintenance.  It does leave one with the question as to whether the problem is as semi-resolved as it appears or could rear its uglier head later on.  Now I can see that some people, if their tablet is showing this behavior, might tend to disregard it, or not fully notice it initially.  None of my two other Windows 8.1 tablets has shown any touch input problems at all.  So, fiddling with any controls that could be related has not been ever necessary with them.\n\n  I'll echo most of the laudatory comments regarding the display quality of the screen, regarding sharpness, colors, etc.  It's not iPad-quality, but I didn't expect it to be.  Just a quick glance at the resolution spec of this device shows that it's unrealistic to expect the iPad's supra-HD display quality.\nI love the fact that the screen aspect is close to 16:9 (16:10, I think).  It looks like a larger 7 Android tablet.  The black bars above and below the image with some movies are not as large as on the iPad, which is 4:3 (like an old TV).  The native images, such as desktop, web browsers, etc. are the size of the screen, as they should be.  My understanding is that Windows 8 was designed initially for screen sizes 10 and above.  Anything under that was uncharted territory, until now.  So, it's understandable that implementing visuals and screen-related features, such as touch, in this smaller form-factor is a new step for Windows tablet technology.  I think we'll need to be a bit tolerant with tap issues, which include not just occasional repetitive outputs but also occasional difficulty in hitting the right web links, getting the wrong icons to open, etc.  This tablet needs to be purchased with a work in progress mentality.  If this will be one's only tablet, or one's first tablet, it may not be the best choice.  For enthusiasts, who often are used to waiting for things to be optimized, it's fine.  Even if you're an enthusiast, remember to hit Maintenance before expecting any tap hypersensitivity to decrease enough, if that's one of your initial problems with the device.\n\n  As for the score, I think I'll leave it at 3-stars for now.  Ideally, a tablet's screen should not have any significant touch problems out of the box.  In my mind, that solidly results in losing two full stars.  I was inclined to get it down to two-stars, but since I'm opting to keep it, I'll leave it at a realistic 3-stars, perhaps considering that it's more like two-and-a-half, 50% of the max.  If this were my only Windows tablet I can see that my level of disappointment might get it closer to one star.  Hopefully the problem will be addressed by Dell or Microsoft later on.  For now, I regard it mostly as a content-consumption device, to read, look at web pages, read e-mail (not necessarily write long e-mail!), watch video clips, and such.  As for text, anything beyond tap-typing URLs, writing brief notes or e-mails, or making one-word or one-short-sentence entries is somewhat out of the question.  Hopefully, I'll be able to change this remark for the better once, and if, this limit is resolved.\n\n  By the way, the best way I've found to work one's way around storage space limitations in a 32gb Windows tablet is to make as full use of the microSD card slot as possible.  Ideally, get a 64gb microSD card, or at least 32gb.  Go to Portable Apps dotcom (write it as it should for it to work on a browser) and download the free software for the platform.  Install it in the microSD card (preferably, make a new folder for it and label it something like PORTABLE APPS-DO NOT REMOVE.  Open this initial program and, from it, choose what Portable Apps you want.  These are mostly open-source Windows programs, like Libre Office, portable Firefox, portable Opera browser (there's portable Chrome but I prefer to have it in main drive as my default browser), and several dozens of additional programs, some fairly well known, others not as much.  Wait for the platform to download and install them.  They will be automatically installed to the location of the platform itself, the microSD card in this case.  Modify your psychology to regard the C: drive as for OS, Metro Apps, and essential programs only, and use the microSD card for any installs which have portable versions available.  This has a pro and a con:  It helps to retain some privacy as apps don't attach any configuration or essential files to Windows; they're completely installed in the external storage.  But you're limited to what the PortableApps platform has available.  Also, if you ever switch microSD card, you have to reinstall the portable apps, or do without them while using a different card. Personally, I always leave the same card stuck in there and always have access to my portable apps.  There are other portable apps that are available but aren't part of the PortableApps group (google to find).  These simply have to be downloaded individually to the microSD card and tapped individually to be used."}

This little guy is a full Windows 8.1 machine, allowing me to run just about everything I'd ever need.  The new Atom proc does not disappoint and is indeed significantly speedier than the prior generation.  Everything is quick and snappy, with fast app start times and a smooth UI experience.  I've installed Firefox just for grins (because I can!), but found that the Touch version of IE truly shines on this device.  The full Windows desktop is still there, if you need it, although haven't had much need for it thus far.\n\nInitial setup was pretty painless; I was pleasantly surprised that once I provided my Microsoft Account, setup asked if I wanted to sync my settings from another Windows 8.1 computer.  Selecting the other PC and continuing through setup did just that.  The machine was almost completely configured with my email accounts, documents, and settings when I logged in for the first time!!!  Apps that I had installed elsewhere also appeared in the Start Screen, although most displayed with a small down arrow icon on the bottom left of the tile, indicating the app would be downloaded and installed the first time I tried to use -- nice.\n\nA question that often comes up is related to free disk space.  Once everything that I needed was installed, I was left with about 8GB free.  I can gain about 5GB if I remove the recovery partition, which I may do for added headroom.  I've also read that disabling hibernation support will save another 2GB.  Don't think storage will be an issue since: (a) there's a microSD slot I can use to expand storage; and (b) I'm not loading tons of content on this device, as I mostly consume from the cloud.  That said, if Amazon runs the 64GB version for the same price as the 32GB, going with it is a no-brainer.\n\nMicrosoft Office Home & Student is included, although as an add'l download.  I haven't installed it yet, but will probably do a minimal install of just Word and PowerPoint. Not sure how these apps will behave on a screen this small, but the 2013 versions of Office do have a touch friendly mode that makes them very usable on tablets.\n\nFrankly, there aren't many cons on this device.  I would have liked to see a micro-HDMI out so I could plug it into my monitor or TV.  There's an option to connect to a wireless display, although haven't explored it.  I suppose it's not something I'd realistically do, since I've got other machines more suitable for that.  The only real configuration change I made was to increase the screen DPI setting to 125% so I could see small text more clearly without having to resort to my reading glasses.\n\nThis mini tablet is the real deal... Perfect size, performance, full Windows app ecosystem, great build quality, and great value.  Dell is back!"}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I made an impulse buy late Friday afternoon.  My week had been long and draining leaving me low on creativity and self control.  I've been eyeing a new tablet to replace my still perfectly good Samsung Galaxy 7.7 that I bought in Hong Kong not even two years ago.  As a gadget lover I always want the latest and greatest.  I am using Samsung's lack of an update for my existing tab, and the tablet's ever decreasing speed as a good reason to do some \"looking around.\"\n\nWell, that looking turned from research to purchase, and I sat anxiously awaiting my new toy's arrival Saturday morning.\n\nOpening the box was a bit underwhelming.  Dell's packaging was lackluster to say the least.  The white outer sleeve looked a bit grimy and had some smudge marks that looked somewhat reminiscent of fingerprints all over.\n\nLifting the tablet from it's box I had mixed feelings about the weight.  The Venue 8 Pro certainly feels well built, but my research indicated that Dell's tab would be lighter than my existing Galaxy.  I haven't weighed them both yet, but I highly doubt the Venue weighs what the specs say it does.  I'll update this later.\n\nApps\n\nIt's all about Apps.  I couldn't determine if several of my favorite applications were available for Windows 8 tablets before pulling the trigger and buying.  Here's what I found:\n\nAmazon Kindle:  The Kindle app is present for Windows 8, but it's missing a lot of important features.  The one I noticed right away was no Amazon Docs.  I email PDF's to myself all the time, lots of my computer magazines like Windows IT Pro come only by PDF these days.  These PDFs end up in my \"Amazon Docs\" which then are available on my phone and tablet (but not PC or Metro Apps).  I also found I couldn't download any magazines I bought through Amazon on the Windows 8 app!  Very frustrating!  One additional side note, there's no pinch to zoom in the Kindle App for Metro, so one can't rapidly increase text size without accessing the settings screen.\n\nSirusXM:  Not available.\n\nFlipBoard:  My number one source of morning news.  Not available! (UPDATE, Flipboard for Windows 8.1 was released on 11/15/2013 and it looks awesome!)\n\nFeedly:  My number two source of morning news.  Not available!\n\nFlickr:  I use Flickr to store my online photos.  There is no app for Flickr available for Windows 8.  My research indicated the built in Photos Metro app was supposed to be able to open Flickr albums, but I never got that to work.\n\nSo these apps (or lack there of) are bummers, but there are lots of awesome programs for this tablet too!\n\nOneNote Metro Style:  Microsoft released a really sweet Metro version of OneNote which is fast and finger-friendly.  I've come to rely heavily on OneNote and was pleased by how nicely the Metro version worked.\n\nWindows Mail:  I've been using the Metro Mail app a lot lately, and find the program pretty nice.  When I opened mail on the Venue I was asked if I wanted to add another mail account.  I entered the credentials for my Gmail account, which is even protected with 2-factor authentication, and everything worked great!\n\nI installed Microsoft Office directly from the shortcut on the start menu.  Again, everything worked amazingly!  Word on your tablet is finger-friendly, fast and easy to use!  After having entered my Microsoft Live ID when setting up the Venue all of my previous accounts were associated with Windows.  When I went to save a file through Word I was given options for two of my work SharePoint sites and my personal SkyDrive account.  That's convenient.\n\nMicrosoft has made major integration improvements to SkyDrive in Windows 8.1  Those improvements are present on the Venue 8 Pro, making all of my SkyDrive documents available immediately.  I loved that!\n\nThe Screen\n\nAs I do with any tablet I might potentially keep, I compared the Venue's screen to that of my Galaxy 7.7.  I still believe the Galaxy 7.7 has THE best screen of any 7/8 inch tablet on the market.  The 7.7 has an AMOLED display, which uses true black.  The resulting colors are vibrant and have incredible contrast.\n\nThe Venue 8 Pro's screen didn't compare when held side to side with the Galaxy 7.7.  In contrast the Venue's screen looked washed out and fuzzy (the archer in the background of my sample picture looked very fuzzy on the Venue's screen).  For giggles, I also compared the Venue with the Galaxy Note 8's screen, which also looked far better (though not as good as the 7.7's screen).\n\nI'm not saying the Venue's screen is bad, it's actually really nice if you don't compare it side by side to any other tablets.  The viewing angles are great and the start screen looks nice and crisp.\n\nSound\n\nWhen I first tested the speaker on the Venue I said \"Hey, that's not too bad.\"  The sound wasn't that great either though.  I thought I heard a little bit of hissing and crackling.  I then compared the sound to the Galaxy 7.7 and Note 8, both blew the Venue away.  The Venue's single speaker simply (despite being larger than than both individual speakers on my Android test tablets combined) can't compare to the far smaller, pair of speakers on both of the other tablets I tested against.\n\nPerformance\n\nThe Venue 8 Pro is a performance MONSTER!  This thing screams along, despite having lots of other programs running.  I was shocked by how quickly the device ran even while performing numerous Windows updates.\n\nInternet Explorer, the Metro version, rips through web pages, delivering them at speeds I would previously thought to have been impossible.\n\nThe built in, on screen keyboard is an absolute delight to type on.  Unlike the Android keyboard I use on my tablet, which is downright infuriating.  The Venue's keyboard is accurate, responsive and rarely lags.  I say rarely because I did notice a slight lag in the keyboard one time.\n\nI really loved using Netflix on this tablet.  While watching a movie you can switch out of Netflix to another program.  When you switch back to Netflix the movie starts automatically without asking you load the movie again (thus not requiring buffering time).  This delay in restarting my Netflix movie has always bothered me with Android devices.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nSo here's what I think:  If you want to be productive and get work done, the Venue 8 Pro is an incredible device.  I can seriously see the Venue as being capable of replacing a laptop for many uses.  I can almost see myself carrying the Venue 8 Pro with me down to St. John this winter without my laptop.  Would I feel comfortable that in a work emergency the Venue would get me through?  Absolutely.\n\nThat being said, I already have a laptop.  Yes, my laptop is huge and yes, my laptop is heavy.  But I've already got one.\n\nNow, here's where the problem comes in.  This device is just not fun.  Many of the apps us Android and iOS users have come to rely on simply don't exist on this platform yet.  Further, the apps that do, such as Kindle, are so limited that one feels like they've downgraded their experience by switching over to the Venue 8.\n\nSome might argue \"You can use the web based versions of the apps your want, so stop your complaining!\"  I could argue \"Why do you need a tablet if everything you want to use can be used in a web browser?  Why not just use a laptop?\"  The reason is that we want a convenient experience that's finger friendly, easy on our eyes and optimized for the device we're using.\n\nI'm willing to sacrifice a few things providing that what I get is a net improvement.  There are too many sacrifices to make with the Venue 8 Pro.  It's a device for productivity, not fun.  If I want to be productive I'll pull my laptop out and work with a full sized keyboard and big screen."}

Then when you factor in all the flexibility this device offers over other tablets plus the fact it comes with a full version of Office Home & Student 2013, its an astonishing value at $299.\n\nIn terms of features SD Card expandability and the ability to use USB devices (micro USB adapters are super cheap) are huge in my opinion - and something the iPad does not offer.  The new Intel Bay Trail Quad-Core processor is excellent, and so far every app, movie, and game I have tested play smooth.  Finally the screen is very good, even though its not Full HD. In my opinion, HD is quite fine on an 8\" screen as the colors are vibrant, viewing angles are wide, and text is crisp. Note, this is an IPS quality display.\n\nMy one recommendation here would be to buy the 64gb version if you don't plan on buying an SD card.  The 32gb of space is used up quickly by the OS and Office 2013."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "After a vast amount of research and endless amount of tablet comparisons, I started to lean heavily toward the Dell Venue 8 Pro. I can say that this tablet is SUPERB and excellent in it's category let alone taking 1st place for a FULL Windows 8.1, 8' tablet.\n\nInitially, I've enjoyed the ipad mini, ipad 2, the amazon kindle fire HD, and the nook HD. I've had this craving to wield a Windows tablet that's capable of performing complex tasks and heavy usage that my laptop normally handles. However, there wasn't a tablet that had drawn me in for awhile.\n\nI was excited to hear about the release of the Sony Vaio Tap 11 and the new Windows Surface 2 and Surface Pro 2 that I was willing to throw down that $700 just to use the full version of Windows. I was sadden when I discovered that the Windows Surface 2 was another Windows RT version (cannot install programs) and began to eye the more expensive tablets. When I arrived at the Microsoft Store, I saw the bulkyness of the Surfaces and couldn't agree with a decision to buy the Pro 2 because it was pretty heavy. However, I was really pleased with the product. I then checked out videos of the Tap 11 and saw that it was slimmer but same price, roughly $800.\n\nAs soon I begun to lose hope, I see a review on youtube of the Dell Venue 8 Pro and it's initial hands on coverage. I was glad to hear that it was a full Windows OS and it was only priced at $299. I was sold.\n\nAfter receiving the Dell Venue 8 Pro, I couldn't stop using the device because of it's alternative functions over the app OS systems and I was EXTREMELY pleased with the speed of the tablet. So far, there hasn't been any issues as of today. As for the initial set up, I turned off the auto brightness (PC settings) and updated the CPU drivers through Dell's website that they encouraged to do so. This of course needs a stylus to navigate through the desktop mode yet for some odd reason I had no problems using the touch screen. I stream all my videos and music through Homegroup from my laptop to this tablet with no lag(of course) and the ease of access. This device also comes with Skydrive which is a cloud system to upload your documents to the web that you can access with any other computer. So that adds another 7gb of virtual memory if you want to transfer things or keep it stored. I'd recommend buying the 64gb version (extra $50) because the OS takes up most the memory. However, you can add SD card if you want more memory. The tablet itself is very light and can be held within your palm. The Windows Store has roughly around 100,000 apps according to Microsoft themselves.\n\nBackground:\nI've always had a Windows pc and laptop that runs XP and Windows 7. I seriously concluded that I didn't like the Windows 8 operating system because of the vast rearranged OS system that didn't seem user friendly. I do like Apple products and wouldn't say that this tablet beats it's counterparts. HOWEVER, this tablet is EXCELLENT for producing a full blown Windows OS seamlessly over ANY tablet in it's size and Windows 8 OS is GREAT on a tablet. I don't agree with it running on a PC or non touchscreen because those features that you used to hate, will soon become something you love. I love this thing. I'm glad I didn't purchase the Surface or the Tap or even the Lenovo Miix2. I was nearly set on buying an ipad mini and other tablets but this one easily bested it's category of 8\" tablet. -Random Computer Tech"}

However, after using it the past week, I have found the size not to be limiting relative to my needs and expectations.\n\nBuild quality is very good, much better than the Asus t100 (the t100 suffered from poor screen resolution, sluggish performance and very slow recharging times). The screen is excellent; WiFi is strong; and battery life superb (I can go 8+ hours without needing a charge and have not run out of juice).\n\nFinally, the hardware i.e. Atom chip has finally realized it's potential and provides very acceptable performance. The one in my Venue 8 is rated at 1.33mhz, and is snappy and runs Office and all apps I have thrown at it well... close to my older Surface Pro... and the battery life is very good. The Venue 8 is in addition to my Surface Pro, and compliments my use of Windows 8.\n\nThe only con I can think of at the moment is lack of a built-in stand, like the Surface or Sony Tap 11 have (though the Surface is a better implementation).\n\nAt the price points for the new generation of Intel based Windows 8 Tablets, it is only a matter of time that the like sized Android tablets see a significant drop in market share."}

It's well designed, beautiful screen, fast, light, good price point and most importantly runs full Windows 8. It can play 1080p youtube videos smoothly, I haven't seen any tablet do that in the past. Battery life is quite amazing for such a small and powerful tablet.\n\nFlash is there which I haven't seen on a tablet since Android stopped supporting it. Tried a few old school flash games and they played smoothly, but most of them require either a mouse or a keyboard to be useful.\n\nThe only frustrating part which I also love is the actual Windows 8 desktop, it's just not designed for such a small screen and I find myself hitting tiny buttons several times (FYI I have average fingers). Also, keyboard doesn't automatically popup in the desktop mode, so you are required to do extra clicks to either open it or close it. Occasionally you will be stuck in full screen mode of some sort (like at the end of CNN video with ads at the end) and the only way to get back is to either click the next video and then minimize it or kill the process in the task manager. Also, got stuck in full screen Chrome and I had to kill the process as well. I just wish it had physical back button instead of Windows Metro which I don't see being used that often.\n\nWifi is great as well and you can stream full 1080p video files from your share such as NAS smoothly.\n\nOverall, it's a wonderful device and possibilities are endless. I see it getting more use then a 7\" Android tablet that I have.\n\nI love it!\n\nFYI: The tablet name is VENUS, according to the sticker on the back."}

I was worried that I would be missing the hi-res screen of the 2013 Nexus 7 as this Dell has only 1280x800 versus the crazy hi-res Nexus 7.  I have always been a proponent of more pixels on the screen.  Well I am here to tell you I am now a convert - the relatively lower-res screen on this Dell is an absolute pleasure to use and makes the device a joy.  Colors are clear and brightness is great.  Viewing angles are amazing.  Set it on a desk and it looks more like a color photo than a tablet.  I can't rave about the screen enough.\n\nYes it's slightly thicker and heavier than other ecosystems devices.  But remember you are getting an entire windows PC in this tiny form factor.\n\nSome other things I appreciate about this device:\nNew haswell z series is really zippy\nSD Card!\nUSB OTG works for most any device\nGreat wifi reception and range and almost immediate linking!\nFull Windows 8.1!\nLoud speaker\nTouch works really well, even for tiny screen elements I can almost always click things I want\nGood battery life - its no ipad mini but 7+ hours isn't out of the question with my normal use. Making through a day is easy.\nDid I mention the screen?!\n\nWhile I will admit that the touch apps both native and in the windows 8 app store are lacking for the windows ecosystem, the fact that you are running full windows means you can install the \"big boy\" app with no trouble, or just use the full version of IE to view it like you would on a PC.\n\nI have heard the horror stories about the stylus although I don't have one yet.  It would be ideal to take notes on it but it is not a deal breaker for me.  At worst it is still the same as an android tablet with fatty capacitive pen.  At best, Dell could probably update the firmware for the pen and fix it so that the active digitizer works to take perfect detailed notes and drawings.  So it definitely has potential even though the experience is not great right now.\n\nDell, I give you an A- on this one, it's nearly my perfect tablet.  Bravo!"}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "It's a nice idea but the implementation is terrible. I am constantly opening the wrong apps when I am trying to scroll through things, or clicking links on pages when trying to scroll, or highlighting everything when trying to scroll. The tablet is only capable of registering your true intentions 50% of the time.\n\nWant to hit a button on the screen? On any android, ipad, phone or whatever a small button isn't really a issue. The system is great at interpreting what your intentions are. Not on this though, try about 10 times and that button click will work, just pray it doesn't register as a left click and you accidentally open something else up that you not have to click 10 times to hope you can close that out. Increasing the DPI to %125 helps a little but not really.\n\nThe Microsoft store is useless. I have like 8 apps to choose from or something. I'm probably doing something wrong but this is my first outing into windows 8 and it's not good.\n\nI thought that the screen just might not be calibrated properly for my individual way of touching the screen so I decided to calibrate it. DO NOT DO THIS! I would repeatedly lose access to the side bar scrolls when you swipe into the center of the screen because after calibration the system thinks I'm touching about a quarter of a inch inside the screen so those controls will not open again.\n\nI am a huge fan of chrome and it works beautifully on everything I own, except this. If a page has been designed after the year 2005 it will not scroll smoothly. Don't even try going to the theverge, facebook, or any other website that requires a little extra oomph. Slide show is a understatement.\n\nHowever, Internet explorer can handle those sites with very mild hiccups which I could live with except I don't like how I have to swipe in from the bottom to make any significant changes, like switching tabs. You can go back by swiping from the left side a little in from the complete edge of the screen so it doesn't think you want to alt tab.\n\nThe tablet gets warm when doing stuff that doesn't seem like it should really be tasking the system. Hands getting mad sweaty warm.\n\nWant to charge the tablet and use some external accessories? Nope, won't happen unless you want to get a Y split OTG cable and want to cut open the wiring to install a switch so the system will let you charge and use something like a power external hub for other toys.\n\nStorage feeling a little sluggish? Double the performance by going into the Bios and changing some of the settings to instantly double the read performance of the built in storage! Don't mind that it should be turn on at the start.\n\nHere are the pros of this tablet. FANTASTIC screen! for a 1280x800 screen it it pretty sharp, really good colors and viewing angles, the blacks are lacking but when are they not on something that isn't a OLED screen.\n\nSolid battery life for what it is, about 7-8 hours."}

The on/off switch and vol. are somewhat set outwards were, for me, sometime I change orientation I end up either turning off or increasing  volume.\n\nThe touch sensor compared to iPad and android tablets is a bit finicky. When typing I will get double and triple taps. Even after reset. Without a thin stylus and using my fingers touching around the desktop becomes a hazard for me. Hitting something I didn't want, or shutting down something I needed.\n\nThe os is good at the metro part, but the desktop, were I do most of my stuff is still buggy and reminds me of vista and win me.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "Finally, an 8-inch Windows tablet!\nPros:\nExternal build quality is excellent. Dell did a great job there!\nAlso, out of the box, everything works nicely together. Been a few days, no hiccups, crashes, BSODs. You can see the amount of testing Dell has put into this little table.\nFeels right in the hand, and very easy to carry with one or two hands. Much better than the larger 10+ inch tablets that were all what you can buy last year.\n\nFaaassstttt! Intel finally got to solve the price/speed/power/heat balance problem they had. Previous Atom generations weren't expensive or used too much energy, but they were too slow for day to day use. The Core processors were fast enough, but expensive and their power usage meant much larger tablets. With Bay Trail, finally the right processor is here. What took you so long, Intel?\n\nCons:\nI wish if I could use it in presentations and meetings at work, but it's quite hard without HDMI or a keyboard. The keyboard problem is easy to fix with Bluetooth. But, a micro HDMI port would have been really nice. Yes, there's Miracast, but the adapters out there aren't cheap enough yet. Most are in $60+ range. And the tech reliability and speed doesn't seem to be quite there either. I know there are other Win8 8\" tablets coming soon that have HDMI built in, but again Dell's Venue 8 pro build quality is outstanding, the price is right and I really needed it now, not weeks later.\n\nOther thoughts:\nHaving 32 GB isn't an issue for me, like it is for others. Out of the box, it has about 12GB free space. So, I got a relatively inexpensive 16GB micro SD, and I managed to double my storage space. I don't know if I'll need more, because I keep most of my important stuff either in external HDDs or on SkyDrive. Let's see."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "Fantastic tablet. I don't have much to add to the other reviewers except to say that on the first night I had two instances where the tablet lost WiFi connectivity. WiFi was enabled but didn't show any WiFi signals. Turning WiFi off and on and doing a reboot doesn't fix the issue. After doing a Windows Refresh the first time (losing much of what I had installed and configured) it worked for a while but then later happened again.\n\nI ran a diagnostic of the hardware and the problem is Dell's WiFi driver. If you encounter this problem go to the Dell site, download the Dell Wireless 1538 WAPI Application (File: DW1538_WAPI_2007_WB32_setup_ZPE.exe) updated on 23/October/2013, install and reboot. If fixed the problem right away.\n\nUPDATE: I really wanted to like this tablet, but found it too frustrating to continue to use. The WiFi issues I mentioned above weren't solved by the driver update and often the tablet would not wake up for 15-20 (of continuous button pressing), after I put it to sleep. The last straw today is that is showing as connected to my WiFi network but can't load any pages (when my computer can) and rebooting won't fix it. These are issues that other Dell users are having and are documented on the Dell Support website. I am tired of resetting it to factory settings and reinstalling everything over and over again hoping things will change.\n\nIt is a well built tablet with a lot to like - probably the best hardware of the current generation. I honestly thought that I found what I was looking for, a tablet with the full functionality of Windows 8.1. Unfortunately, the bugs are such that I don't feel like I can trust it and back it goes. Reluctantly, I got the Lenovo instead."}

While the 1280 by 800 screen is not state of the art, the screen is clear and responsive to touch.  The entry level price is ($299) is excellent, and the limitations of a 32 gig SSD can be partially overcome by installing applications on a micro-sd card.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "Let me first start by stating I am a huge fan of the Apple line of products. There are several reason why I feel this way, but the greatest reason(s) are the seamless integration between the iOS and OSX products. Now why is that important in a review of a Dell product with a Microsoft OS? Because I believe Dell may have been the first to nail it with the Venue 8 Pro and has actually built a viable, price competitive alternative to the iPad and Apple product integration.\n\nLet's start:\n\nThe product is packaged in a manner which would make Jobs take notice. It was carefully wrapped and protected in a graceful and artistic manner. The tablet, cord and charger were protected and easily accessed. Like Apple, the operating instructions are sparse and direct to the point (more on this later).\n\nOverall the construction, fit and finish appears to be on par with the iPad Mini I use everyday, except where apple uses an alloy Dell has chosen a polycarbonate. While I didn't weigh the Venue it does feel lighter than the iPad Mini.\n\nThe device powered right up and walked me through the initialization and signing into my Microsoft account. I was pleasantly surprised to see my personal start screen (from my desktop) and email account just showed up. Good for Microsoft the Apple seamless experience is rubbing off at their headquarters.\n\nWhat it didn't do was automatically update Windows 8.1 and the \"Secureboot\" bug (in the lower right corner some non-Microsoft devices show a message) was on the screen. After doing an OS update the bug was still there so I had to go to the Microsoft web site and download the fix for this known problem.\n\nThe Venue is advertised as coming with Office 2013 installed. While it is installed and the packaging includes a key to activate it the problem is it won't activate (I entered my key but it was rejected) by just starting the program from the tile. I had to go again to the Microsoft web site and download the installer for Office with the provided key to activated it for my Venue.\n\nNow here comes the big difference or issue people may find with the Venue; it is not an iPad.\n\nWhat the iPad provides is a simple (for most) GUI interface that is standardized across all iOS devices. The Venue 8 Pro is a full tilt Windows 8.1 computer and with that comes all the power and complexity of Windows. The reason why I am pointing this out is if you have zero experience with Windows 8.1 the learning curve for the interface is a tad bit higher than iOS and Dell provides zero instructions about how to use the device (turn it on and off yes).\n\nOne issue I did find a bit annoying is how Windows 8.1 interfaces with the screen keypad. Many (if not most) Windows programs (unlike iOS and the iPad) are not designed to work with the on screen keypad, so quite often the text box you will be typing in gets hidden by the screen keyboard. Because of this I highly recommend purchasing a BT Keyboard to go with your Venue.\n\nOverall, as others have said, this is the tablet size and format Microsoft should add to their collection. With the changes in Win 8.1 and its integration across devices I believe this is the first serious alternative to the iPad on the market. Price, quality, features, portability and ergonomic design of the Venue Pro 8 make Dell a leader in the 8\" tablet market. This device (and a BT keyboard) should be on the Christmas list of any serious Windows 8 fan who has been waiting for an alternative to the iPad.\n\nOne note: The Wireless is faster than the current iPad (except the iPad Air which has the same wireless radio design as the Dell) series.\n\nPS. I did not give it five stars for these reasons:\n1. Windows 8.1 is more complex than iOS\n2. No USB.\n3. Not completely (almost)  seamless in setting it up.\n4. Windows 8.1 really needs a BT Keyboard to actually do serious typing.\n\nAfter a few more hours with the Venue:\n\nToday I attempted to play live TV from my Venue but it seems Media Center Pro is not part of the package. I have a TV (HD Home Run) tuner hooked up to my wireless network and the Venue automatically identified and added it to the device list, which makes it available for programs to use. Two problems, Media Center Pro costs another $99.00 dollars to get TV Tuner capability and I couldn't find an alternative Windows 8.1 capable tuner software for the Venue. If any one has one which works drop a comment to my Review and let myself and others know about it. Thanks!\n\nOne Month Later:\n\nNow that I have used this pad for a month  thought an update would be helpful.\n\n1st - I like my iPad Mini better. Yes I know many of the readers really dislike the evil Apple Empire and are looking for an alternative, but quite frankly the iPad combined with iTunes is a whole lot easier for downloading and syncing content. On the Venue 8 Pro the easiest way to sync data is to copy from your desktop to a miscro sd card and insert in the Venue slot. Then one has to go to the desktop and select the content to opened by a Windows 8 App.\n\n2. The Windows 8 music and video apps were more than cumbersome when finding the content I had stored on the Micro SD drive.\n\n3. The Windows 8.1 interface worked very well after upgrading the BIOS and downloading the latest drivers from Dell.\n\n4. Do not forget to bring your Dell charger with you! This device requires at minimum a 2.4 AMP charger. The 10W iPad charger will not work, however you can use the 12W iPad charger. It will not charge from a standard USB computer port."}

Finally, we are beginning to see the windows oem vendors start to build and release hardware that shows respect for their customers.  Compare the quality and price of the venue 8 pro to the acer w3 and you will see what I mean.  The Acer W3 was an insult to windows users--the venue 8 says windows users can have quality hardware commensurate with android and apple and at a reasonable price.  Thank you Dell!  Are you listening HP!\n\nPros:\n\n- Screen: Fantastic, no complaints, beautiful, bright movies, pictures, everything looks gorgeous on it.\n- Sound: Loud, clear in fact much louder than the surface pro\n- Build Quality: Thin, light, solid build, good simi-rubberized back easy to hold. comparable to quality of ipad mini and high end galaxy note.\n- Pen: I have not tested the pen, but that it has an active pen for me to use with OneNote, well this is icing on the cake.\n-FULL DESKTOP OS: Now granted many desktop applications are not touch friendly, but you can get the stylus and render this issue mute for desktop apps.  You can run all of your company's applications on this device--if you choose not to fine, but you have the choice.  There are more than 4 million applications available to the windows desktop.  Peripheries will have no problems working with this tablet, is that true for ios and android?\n\n- Office: No, you are not going to write a dissertation on an 8inch device, but if you were so inclined, with office you could. Having office means that, if I need to tweak a document I can do so while leaving the document native format untouched.  When I am in meetings, OneNote allows me to have all of my meeting documents organized in a tablet, take notes, and send follow-up items to my assistant.  Simply by sharing the notebook with my assistant through SkyDrive  my notes can be seen instantly as I am writing them.  We can collaborate on excel, word, PowerPoint documents---PRODUCTIVITY, YES!  It's like I am buying a copy of Office and Microsoft is throwing in a wonderful tablet for free--folks this is a no brainer!\n\n- PRICE: I would have easily paid more than $400.00 for this tablet and would have thought it was a steal at that price, but $299, it's a no brainer\n\nCONS:\n\n- WAIT TIME: It took two darn long for a windows OEM Vendor to produce a product like this.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS:\n\nIf you are a PRODUCTIVITY-CONSUMPTION USER, then this tablet is perfect for you. You can work and play on it.  Any 8inch tablet is going to limit the extent of you authoring activities unless you hook up to a keyboard, mice and large monitor.  But the fact that you can do tweaking of documents you authored, you can collaborate, take notes, etc. This tablet can do what no ipad mini or android mini tablet can do.\n\nIf you are a CONSUMPTION-PRODUCTIVITY USER, you will still find this tablet extremely useful to more than satisfy your needs, though if you are an extreme game consumption user, you might find more mobile games on other platforms, though the added benefit of running a full desktop os, might offset this.\n\nApple and Android vendors have creating competition, force MS and it's vendors to get up off of their keasters if they want to play at this level, and frankly I am grateful to Apple and Android for playing hard ball, at the close of the day we are all the winners for it."}

Being that I travel and needed something for me so I decided to go for the 8 inch market. I tried the Acer W3 literally for a day and return it due to the horrible screen. With the lack of any other competitor I remained with the mini. Don't get me wrong the iPad mini is a great tablet, but after using my Asus RT tablet it convinced me that I needed something that I could use as a consumption device and to an extent productivity... office.\n\nI've been keeping tabs on the Dell 8 Pro since it was first announced. I managed to find one two days ago at a local big box competitor of Amazon. I will try not to repeat what you have already read. My initial impression is this... this is the 8 inch Windows tablet to beat! The build quality is on par with the iPad mini. I'm not speaking to materials of construction but overall quality. Just holding it will tell you the excellent job Dell did with it and didn't skimp on it like Acer did with their unit. Dell has set the bar high.\n\nThe OS is very responsive. And for those of you who are wondering - this is NOT the RT version, its a full version Windows 8.1!  Ive tested the tablet by having up to 10 applications and web pages with heavy flash open at the same time with no lag! Screen is beautiful... setting both the mini and the Dell tablets next to each other you can see the difference especially at full brightness. As for battery life....ive only charged it once since purchase, but it seems to be on par with the iPad mini. But this is going off of my usage.\n\nOverall this is the best tablet I've ever used... its a keeper for me.\n\n**UPDATE (113013):\nSo I've had this tablet for a coupe weeks now.  Things I have noticed so far: 1) When gaming for an extended amount of time, the tablet will get hot in one area, but when you consider the sealed casing its to be expected.  I have not had any other issues to report that could be a negative.  But as other have pointed out, be prepared to install quite a few updated initially...keep in mind that this tablet comes with a complete OS, not some dumbed down tablet OS like - iOS, android or windows RT.\n\nAs for performance, it continues to amaze me how awesome this little device is.  But the one thing that I was waiting to do and primary reason for my review update is that fact that you can indeed run iTunes on it and manage your devices.  I have a company issues iphone and up until now have had to manage my media files via my laptop.  But when I bought the Dell Tablet, I thought what if...well the answer is yes, you can run iTunes on the Dell Venue 8 Pro.  And it runs very smooth - I do apologize for the grainy video, but I believe the point is made.  Great job MS and Dell !!!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "Normally for a tablet that is under $300, vendor tends to use single band (2.4GHz only) one-stream (1x1, single antenna) WiFi to cut cost.  However, Dell Venue 8 Pro uses dual band (2.4GHz and 5GHz) two-stream (2x2, dual antenna) MIMO WiFi, which is the highest WiFi spec among mobile devices (phones and tablets) today.\n\nApple highlighted on its website that both the new iPad Air and the new iPad Mini With Retina Display use dual band two-stream MIMO WiFi.  Apple calls it 'Advanced wireless'.  Amazon also highlighted that both the new 7\" and 8.9\" Kindle Fire HDX use dual band two-stream MIMO WiFi, which it calls 'Ultrafast wireless'.  Among all four 8\" Windows 8.1 tablets announced so far,  Dell Venue 8 Pro is the only one that offers dual band two-stream MIMO WiFi.\n\nDual band allows WiFi to operate in the 5GHz frequency band, in addition to the 2.4 GHz band.  2.4 GHz band is very 'crowded', offers a very limited number of channels to operate, and has interferences from other devices.  5 GHz band is 'clean', offers a lot more channels to operate, and free from many of the interferences.\n\nTwo-stream (with two antenna) MIMO WiFi allows two data streams to be transmitted at the same time in transmit mode; two data streams to be received at the same time in receive mode.  As a result,  it doubles the communication speed and throughput of an one-stream (with one antenna) WiFi.  In addition, two-stream MIMO WiFi enables much longer range and signal reliability than one-stream WiFi.\n\nFor the new Miracast feature (wirelessly projecting video onto TV) introduced in Windows 8.1,  two-stream MIMO WiFi provides a much better Miracast video quality than one-stream WiFi because of the speed and signal reliability.\n\nSo with dual band two-stream MIMO WiFi, you'll enjoy fewer dropped connections and faster media streaming, plus you'll be able to go further from your wireless hotspot than with other tablets.  Since WiFi is the only communication medium in most of the tablets, a good WiFi really enhances the user experience whether you are at home, at work, or at the Starbucks."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "Everything was fine, until last year, (I'm not sure if was an update) but the Tablet freezes and reboots like 5 times in an hour now. I used this Tablet exclusively for Netflix, but now is very annoying to see a 20 mins program between 3 reboots."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "The speaker never worked. After a month or two the area surrounding the speaker would get so hot it burned to the touch, and would be unusable. A month or two after that, there were countless glitches, that I don't have the time to tell you guys about. Eventually threw it away and switched to something else."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FEE7B1I", "review": "I am writing this review from the tablet right now.  Was pleasantly surprised to find that it came with a keyboard dock which converts it to a notebook, not just a tablet.  Also, it came with Windows 8.1, but had an icon to upgrade to Windows 10.  Just finished the upgrade a couple of hours ago with minor difficulty (had to turn of the firewall during install...no big deal).  The upgrade didn't cost anything.  Very nice..  The keyboard dock makes a tablet stand unnecessary, and is just nice for an old-school touch typist like myself.  Plus I can use the touchpad on the keyboard dock, attach a mouse, or just use the touch screen on the tablet; all interchangeably and/or simultaneously.  Had the memory I really wanted and the speed compared to my previous tablets is awesome.  Love the RAM.  Very happy, very happy, and thank you, Mom, for my lovely Christmas present."}
