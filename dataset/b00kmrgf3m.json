{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF3M", "review": "If you want a fast tablet experience, then get a tablet.\nIf you want a fast light weight laptop with a real OS, then buy an ultrabook.\nIf you'd like both but only have enough money for a tablet... then this is an EXCELLENT compromise.\n\nThe build quality excellent. It's strong & light and works in a number of different ways... Laptop style, flat, back bend for video playback, or as a tablet. In case you were wondering, yes the keyboard is exposed on the back when in the tablet configuration, but the keys are disabled once the screen is flipped around, plus they're recessed so they aren't really in the way. The battery life has been very good I've gotten at least 6 hours of life if not more. The Windows 8.1 OS is reasonable for tablet use and the touchscreen works well with it. And while it doesn't come across as zippy, It loads fast enough that I don't get video lag or ever feel like I'm waiting on it either. It does seem to run faster when plugged in. So if you're doing anything intensive, it's not a bad idea to plug in.\n\nThe only cons I can think of are the lack of dedicated F keys (they're shared with the number row), and I've had one small hiccup with the trackpad in Chrome (fixed with a reboot). Other than that it hasn't locked up or acted unexpectedly.\n\nOverall, if money is tight any you need the laptop for work/school but would like to occasionally flip it back and just consume content then this is a great deal."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF3M", "review": "This laptop is pretty fantastic in all categories, aside from a few cons here and there.\nThe metal shell of the laptop really makes it look more expensive than it is and the surface is virtually fingerprint free.\nThe screen is bright and vivid and the touch screen is responsive.  Although after a while finger prints build up, but that is to be expected. The screen is a little oddly placed as it has a different distance from the top edge as it does from the sides and bottom edge. I'm not sure why they didn't center the screen but you shouldn't have a problem unless you have ocd.\nIt also folds flawlessly when you want to use it as a tablet and is perfect when using it while laying down as you can prop it up at 270 degrees. The hinges are very sturdy and at first, I was skeptical on how well they would hold up if you constantly converting from a laptop to a tablet, but I think they will hold up just fine.\nA downside in the design is that when using it as a tablet or at 270 degrees, the screen partly covers the exhaust vent so it doesn't efficiently remove the heat. It also heats up the screen where it covers the vent. This may become a problem if you're watching a movie in tablet mode as it might overheat due to the strain on the processor and lack of ventilation.\nThe keyboard feels large even though it is smaller than standard. There is also no bend in the chassis whatsoever when pushing hard on the keys.\nThe touchpad is grainy to the touch but is very responsive. The left and right click on the other hand have to travel a fairly far distance before they actually click. It will definitely take a little getting used to.\nThe speakers are of good quality and can actually play very loud for a small laptop.\nThe speed of the laptop is a little slow, but I'm used to a desktop with 10gb of ram and an i7, so I'm probably a little biased but I intend to upgrade the hard drive to an ssd and maybe add larger ram to give a boost.\nAll-in-all, this is a very well made laptop and with this price you really can't go wrong. If you're on the fence I would say this is a no-brainer.\nI will update if I come across any problems."}

The best feature is the touch screen which is very responsive, but the track pad sometimes lags and is not as responsive. The screen is very clear, with vibrant colors and good off angle viewing. The construction of the hybrid good and solid. It does not feel cheap, even considering it's low cost. This product would be best used for web browsing, office applications, and light gaming."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF3M", "review": "Two different ways of holding the pants up, so that if one fails, the other will suffice. That is one of the underlying principles of the Internet (and electrical power grids). There is more than one pathway to reach the destination, so if the shortest one fails, not all is lost.\n\nMy IT experience dates back to the antediluvian age of punch cards. Along the way, I've been offered many an upgrade, many a \"revolutionary new product.\" The advantages of some of the new products - for example, magnetic storage disks as opposed to punch cards - were so obvious that I immediately embraced them. In many other cases, the advantages were far less apparent and/or, did the new product contain flaws? Realization of the latter was pithily captured in the enduring aphorism of the IT field: \"I'll wait for version 2.0.\" (Who remembers the first boxy, klutzy Kindles?)  Conceptually, one of the largest appeals of this latest laptop offering from Dell is the proven technologies.  They have combined two - the internal hard drive, and a touchscreen, both now well beyond version 2.0, which provides a greater range of possibilities, yes, both belts and suspenders.\n\nThe reality of this laptop I found equally gratifying.  And it started with the set-up phase. How many \"Please wait, still loading\" signs would I see? None. It seemed that Dell has addressed the set-up issue about as well as humanly possible. Quantitatively, for me, that equaled about 20 minutes, and I had a functioning product, reading what passes for news on the Internet.\n\nI'm leery of clouds, and it has nothing to do with thunderstorms. Having important documents, or a lifetime of pictures, or even seven years of Amazon reviews just \"out there\" remains a bit unnerving. Sure, as a backup, I am all in favor, in fact, two \"clouds\" are better than one. The Dell Inspiron 500 gigabyte hard drive provides plenty of \"immediacy\" for those valuable files, and yes, I'd also have them on an external hard drive. (B&S forever?)\n\nI also have an Acer Chrome, which does not have a hard disk drive, but does provide the utility of having both a touchscreen and a keyboard. I'm still NOT a member of Twitter, believing if you really have something to say, it might take more than 140 characters. Thus the quirky old Qwerty keyboard is essential, and even as I use it, I wonder how many years will it be until it is no longer provided as an option - like the CD ROM - since voice recognition technology would be as \"infallible\" as things get in \"this vale of tears.\" So, in addition to typing emails, I'll also be typing all those Word documents that still seem to dominate my life.\n\nSpeaking of which, I transferred over some old Word files. You get a message that Microsoft office is not on your laptop, and you are directed to Microsoft's website, and given a couple of options, one for about 6 bucks a month, the other for 9, so that their entire suite of office products can be utilized. (Consider it a donation to the numerous good causes the Gates' support.) I haven't tried it yet, but assume the product will be physically located on your laptop. Another essential additional purchase is some form of virus protection. It does contain large elements of a \"protection racket,\" but what can you do? All the major anti-virus programs have failed me in the past. I am currently using Norton on my desktop. Dell is offering McAfee for 30 days, for free, and I'll go with them. I have configured much of my desk top computer for the \"Google\" world of the Chrome browser, and Google searches. Dell makes it easier to be in the Microsoft world of Internet Explorer, and Bing searches, and I have decided to stay that way... effectively being able to monitor, at least to my personal satisfaction, which works better over time.\n\nThe operating system is Windows 8.1, and I find it quite intuitive. Dell has a \"Home\" key that will take you immediately back to the \"Start,\" and I find that handy. I also have a Kindle Fire, and read approximately 30-40% of my books that way. The only noticeable flaw in the Kindle is erratic changes between the horizontal to vertical display. Microsoft 8.1 has a prominent \"Kindle\" button on the start page. I was readily able to access all my books, and immediately checked the changes between horizontal and vertical displays. It was perfect!\n\nThe biggest obvious advantage over the various tablets (and even cell phones) out there is that one can work on documents (or even spreadsheets) without being connected to the Internet (or your cell phone provider.) Battery life is advertised at 7.5 hours (and there are now portable chargers). I intend to carry this with me backpacking - ah, that elusive goal of \"portability\", and although I cannot backpack the loads I could when I was working with punch cards, at 3.3 lbs., it should be no problem. I'll provide an update to this review after 90 days of operating experience, but for now, definitely 5-stars, plus."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF3M", "review": "I wasn't sure what to expect with this because I have another laptop with similar specs but a different Intel processor and different brand and it seems to give me those high usage warnings frequently, especially when multi-tasking and/or watching videos and movies.  I am so pleased to say that I have had zero issues with this one so this processor and setup must do the trick.  It works like a dream! BTW, this is an Intel Pentium N3530 2.16 Ghz.  At the bottom of the page w/comparable specs, it shows an Intel Celeron.\n\nI haven't really had a huge desire for a tablet because I just thought I prefer the laptop style and I figured this would just be cumbersome, but I was wrong about this too.  This is a very small laptop but a large tablet and it is so easily mobile.  It's very lightweight and just flipping it all the way open and folding the keyboard back is so simple.  It makes it so portable and you just pull up the virtual keyboard on the screen and all works perfectly.  The screen adjusts to whether you are holding vertically or horizontally just as it does on a tablet.\n\nThe display, sound and webcam are fantastic too.  I've had issues with sound recently on laptops so I'm so glad I hear well on this one.  With such a small laptop I wasn't sure but it works great and the screen resolution is pristine.  The whole computer feels quality even though lightweight.  When I pulled it out of the box and it was so compact and light I was a bit hesitant and unsure.  Give it just a little time. Once you get used to it I think you will be so pleasantly surprised.\n\nFinally, I will admit I've owned a few Dell laptops over the years and was less than impressed. However, I got a Dell desktop a few months back and it is fantastic and have had no issues with it.  And just since I've had this one, I like it more and more the longer I have it. So, I think they may have turned a corner on any issues they've had.  I know I have with any that I've had with them.  Great, quality products and enthusiastically recommend this computer, especially if you have to tote a laptop around frequently but don't want an open tablet as I didn't.\n\nUPDATE: I've had this computer for several weeks and have still had no error messages or high usage warnings.  I noticed that there was a 3 star review on here that said it is basic and the trackpad isn't responsive.  I want to say that my trackpad is very responsive. Because this is such a small laptop it may take some getting used to - pad itself is large.  Also, for this price point and with these specs, this computer performs amazingly well. I can watch movies or livestream while performing other tasks and have no problems at all.  No, it's not for heavy gamers, but I think most of them would not search for these specs and dimensions. I find myself taking this from room to room all throughout the day because it's so portable. Still enthusiastically 5 stars for me!\n\nI've had a couple of questions about the keyboard...it is pretty small because it is a small computer and, thus, a little harder to type on.  I definitely find it easier to type on the larger keyboards and miss that.  However, I would lose the easy portability if they made it any larger and I wouldn't want that.\n\nUPDATE 4/22/2015:  Just wanted to update that this computer is still working perfectly.  I use it every single day and have had no issues at all.  Everything works great and it's still my favorite of all that I have.  I have seen some of the negative reviews and issues but I have had none of that.  I told my mom just last week that she should buy one for her and for my niece.  I think it's a great computer at a great price."}

I pretty much love everything about this laptop as it suits my needs of somebody always taking it on the go to go wifi everywhere or sit in my small living space to watch shows. It doesn't weight me down at all and can barely tell I have it in my backpack if I'm using it, and I'm using a smaller side bag it still fits with room for the charger/mouse/HDs. I think when I got it having 3 USB ports was sort of a new thing but I still love the idea because I have to go wireless mouse leaving me with two solid USB ports which really get the job done as I transfer files between hard drives constantly. Of course now I would love to have 1TB of HD space but 500TB is getting me buy as I have 5 different HDs with about 10TB of things between them. The shell has lasted a long time with something placed on it pretty much every night and will last for a great while longer. The battery life is solid as I can squeeze about 4 hours still out of it unplugged and that is watching something off of a hard drive with full lighting on. Only con would be that it did completely crash one time and I had to wipe it clean to factory reset. I would totally recommend this for anybody wanting a very good reliable smaller laptop that is for mostly internet browsing, watching media, and light gaming."}

I bought it and kept it unopened in my closet for several months because it was going to be a gift. When the time came around to opening it a key immediately fell off the keyboard. I called Dell support and since it was still under warranty, they sent out a pre labeled shipping box. I sent the laptop in and a few weeks later it was sent back.\n\nI took it out of the box (by then I had gotten my daughter a different gift) and as I turned it on it made a loud grinding noise and a bunch of numbers mixed with letters flashed on the screen for about 10 seconds. No words, just a bunch of garbled stuff. Then the screen went blank and I could it hear it making noise, it was on, but nothing showed up on the screen.\n\nAfter waiting a few minutes I pressed the power button down for a few seconds and it restarted. This time, there was no loud grinding noise and nothing weird came up on the screen. For a period of about 3 weeks the laptop was used for less than an hour. It was never moved nor dropped. One day I picked it up to move it to another table and as I opened it up to use it, three keys fell off. At this point, I had had it. I put the laptop on a shelf and left it there for months. Many months. I kept putting off calling tech support and well, as you can imagine, by the time I got around to calling, the warranty had already expired.\n\nThe guy I spoke with said they would repair it for $149 dollars. I then asked him how much it would cost me to extend my warranty. He said I couldn't do that because I had damaged it. WHAT?! I realized it was useless for me to sit there and explain all this to him so I just said thank you for your help and hung up. I found a keyboard online for under 20 bucks - I'll repair it myself then just keep it as an emergency back up or give it away.\n\nOne other thing I want to note is that is was quite sluggish. It took long to boot up and just seemed very slow when opening/running any program.\n\nBottom line is: I'm never buying another DELL product again."}

When it arrived, the unit worked worked as intended. I was thrilled with it. It was fast, responsive, but still small enough to carry around without it being cumbersome. However, on my second day of use, I noticed that the touch screen was having \"phantom\" touches in the top right corner of the screen. It would bounce my mouse up to that corner, or exit programs completely. I made sure that the software was up-to-date and that nothing was around it. I tried a few fixes that I read online. Unfortunately, it only got worse. Instead of a single phantom touch every hour or so, the screen started - as best as I can describe - spasming in the top right corner. From the moment I got it, I carried it by hand, or in a padded laptop case, and kept it from being pressed against anything, so I know nothing I did damaged it. Perhaps I just happened to get one with a bad screen, but I decided to return it for a refund, as it was too much money to risk on it again.\n\nI gave it two stars instead of one because the actual system on the laptop is fantastic. As I said, quick and responsive, and more than enough power for mobile work. The touch screen, however, is a no go. I would recommend this laptop only if it doesn't have a touchscreen."}

It seemed very nice, despite a lower-end processor, and has kept up pretty well for what I needed it to do. The specs on it are fine, and the touch screen addition was nice -- but the physical hardware on this caused me A LOT of problems.\n\nI purchased a two-year insurance plan, where the computer can be fixed for free. I have had to send it for repairs at least three times. The first two times within 6 months of purchasing, the hinges on the screen would get stuck and get pulled out of place, not allowing it to fold back or even fold up properly. The third time about half a year ago, there were dead lines in the screen and one of the arrow keys quit. I nearly sent it back a fourth time because now, a portion of my keyboard (a, z, Caps Lock, 1, Escape keys) will quit and it takes a couple minutes of pressing before they work again. As well, the touch pad is very unresponsive -- ever since I first got the laptop it was very sporadic and the cursor jumps all over the place. Now, it will not respond to touch at all for a few minutes a few times per day.\n\nThe good -- good battery life at about 6-7 hrs, portable, bright screen, and not too shabby for running what I need it to do (programming, office-based, older games, multiple windows up at once, etc.). But all of this can be outweighed by the fact that the actual hardware is awful and failed multiple times. I no longer trust Dell laptops as I had other problems in the past, and this 2-1 fad is definitely not for me. There are too many problems arising from them."}

Got  to download OpenOffice or whatever you like to use.

I needed a tiny computer with a decent amount of storage, It worrks for that. Just a lot of little things, that are annoying. I definitely would NOT buy the $400 one.

There are poor students like me that has to be careful how to spend money and Dell has been around for years which was a good reason to trust their product."}

Instead of sending it back to the manufacturer, I went to my university to have it fixed while it was under warranty. (In retrospect, I should have sent it back). Since then, the left side of the keyboard has stopped working altogether. I've taken it to the techs at my university several times, and they said I would have to spend ~$400 to have the keyboard and motherboard replaced. I looked it up online and this seems to be a reoccurring issue. I'm not sure if the newer models addressed the keyboard issue, but I will never buy an Inspiron 2-in-1 ever again."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF3M", "review": "I bought this product in December of 2014. It WAS a great computer at first. I loved the tablet to laptop feature of it, but about 3 months after purchase the device decided that the charge was not recognizable, but it still charged; so, I didn't have an issue there. About 12 months after purchase, the left side of my keyboard started \"glitching\" the \"A\" would only work half the time plus the keys surrounding the \"A\". I did the BIOS update as recommended but that did not solve the problem, but I was just going to pay $60 to get my keyboard replaced. Before I was able to get my keyboard replaced last month (August of 2016) I went to turn my computer on, and it acted like the battery was dead, the screen flashed on then off quickly. I immediately tried charging it, but it would not light up as charging. I assumed that the computer just gave up on the charger finally. Next, I ordered a new charger, which did not work. So, my next step was to take it to the computer repair man (I assumed that the charger port had gone bad). The charger/charger port was not the issue. The computer motherboard had failed, and I was not under warranty anymore with Dell. He said that this is the 3rd one of this model that he had seen do the same thing. So, I would not recommend purchasing this computer, even at this low of a price, it did not last me two year. I personally do not feel as though it is worth it."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF3M", "review": "I had been dreaming of having my own tiny-sized laptop for some time, but for many years it was just out of my measly budget.  Then, the prices started to come down a bit, and more and more budget model tiny laptops started hitting the market.  I still didn't have much money to expend, though, so  I did a bit of research when choosing which to buy.  Thats when I stumbled upon this little diamond in the rough - the Dell Inspiron i3147.\n\nWhen I say diamond in the rough, I mean that this laptop isn't really that good in its standard, stock form.  It has a pitiful old HDD 5400 rpm hard drive, the RAM is only 4GB, and it has a bit of an older processor (I got the Pentium quad core version).  However, its hard to judge it based on that, because with some upgrades, it could be turned into something much nicer  I went ahead and swapped out the hard drive for a nice 500GB SSD (I used the Samsung 850 EVO 500GB 2.5-Inch SATA III Internal SSD), and upgraded the RAM to 8GB (I used the Kingston HyperX Impact Black 8GB DDR3L CL9 SODIMM 1.35V Laptop Memory stick).  I also threw in an updgraded dual-channel wifi card since the one that comes with it is actually single channel (this was cheap, and only cost me like ten bucks used).  After the upgrades, I noticed a big jump in improvement.  It was usable, but a bit sluggish with its stock components, but now it feels much more responsive.  The older processor is very much the bottleneck on performance here, but with the upgrades, this laptop is now something nice that can serve me well for a few years to come.\n\nAs far as softwareit comes with Windows 8 stock (I believe, I bought mine used without an OS).  Ive heard tell that the firmware for it isn't very good in regards to the tablet feature (lots of complaints of the keyboard not properly locking in tablet mode and whatnot).  I am not so bothered by that, though, since I really had no intentions of using it as a tablet.  Physically, its a bit too heavy and awkward to make a good tablet experience anyways (i.e.  if you want a tablet, buy a tablet).  As for the OS, I have Linux Mint XFCE running on it, and it runs well (with a few little quirks, but, ah, that's the world of Linux for you!).  As for a Windows experience, Ive actually run Windows 7 through Virtual Box on it, and it works pretty well, so I imagine that Windows 7 would probably run well on it if installed directly (I cant speak for Windows 8 or 10, though).  As for battery life, I get about 5-8 hours on it running Mint, depending on what Im doing (videos vs typing, etc.).\n\nAs for its physical characteristics, it is indeed a very small laptop, measuring a little over 11.75\" by a little under 8\" (it is \" thick).  It weighs right around 3 lbs, which is plenty light for a laptop.  The silver body (I think its a thin aluminum on top, but the bottom is plastic) looks and feels nice, although it is rather slippery, which makes opening/closing the laptop a bit tricky (just be careful).  The hinges on mine were quite strong, and I doubt theyd break any time soon.  Also, the back removes for easy upgrades, but you should be a bit gentle and careful when removing it (especially around the USB ports), because the plastic tabs that help hold it in place and other bits can snap if you're not careful.\n\nMoving on with hardwarethe screen looks nice, crisp and clear (although also rather glossy and glare-riddled), and the touchscreen part seems to work reasonably well (although this can also be affected by software).  The speakers are surprisingly loud for being so tiny, and they sound pretty good (it even sounds good through earbuds, which says to me that the sound card is decent).  I should also mention the USB ports.  I believe amazons description says (or used to say) that there are only two, but it actually has three.  One of them is actually a USB 3.0 port, which is a majorly pleasant surprise!  The touchpad works well in terms of sensing your movements, but it is a bit too sensitive.  It has that problem where you can be typing and your palms accidentally touch the pad and cause the cursor to fly across the screen, ruining your typing.  This is a pretty common problem with laptop touchpads in general, so I don't really count it against this laptop.  If you are running Windows, then Touchpad Blocker works great to help prevent this issue.  On Linux, well, Touchpad Indicator is normally a good program to use, but for some reason it doesnt seem to work on this laptop.  So, I got around this issue by just completely disabling the touchpad from the system settings menu.  I use a usb mouse, and if my mouse ever died and I needed to re-enable the touchpad on the fly, I could always navigate with the touchscreen to turn it back on.\n\nLastly, I should talk about the keyboard.  This is probably the weakest link in the physical build of the hardware.  While the keys are laid out as nicely as possible for a small laptop, and they don't feel too bad, the keyboard does flex a bit when you type, and the whole thing seems a bit cheap.  I have read that some people had their keyboards actually crack, but I don't really feel that will happen to mine based on how it feels to me.  Then again, Im pretty gentle when I type and don't bang on things, so that might factor into it.  I wouldnt write a novel on this laptop, but Id say that if you are reasonable with the keyboard, you probably won't have a problem.\n\nOverall, Im finding it rather hard to choose a rating for this laptop.  On the one hand, the stock setup isn't terribly impressive, and can only be described as mediocre to subpar (plus, Ive heard tell that Windows 8 had numerous hardware compatibility issues with this laptop).  However, on the other hand, it is easy to upgrade and has the ability to be turned into something quite nice for the price.  If you do what I did and buy used components as much as possible, you can save quite the pretty penny (I ended up getting my laptop and all its upgrades for $350 total once all was said and done  an impressive final price for a decent tiny laptop).  Plus, if you have an even tighter budget, a smaller SSD will help you cut even more off the cost.  Hmmgiven the potential this laptop has, and its relatively solid hardware, I guess Ill give it a generous 4-star rating.  If you find that you're on a budget and also somewhat technologically inclined (I am actually not that knowledgeable  I just taught myself how to do the upgrades from internet tutorials), then buying and upgrading this laptop yourself is definitely a solid option!"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF3M", "review": "There are a lot of negative reviews on  thread, and I can understand why.  Out of the box, this is a slower machine, and the quality of parts is not premium.  But I am using this machine even right now, because 2 very simple, and quick upgrades have turned this laptop into a much more capable and fun item.  Here's my advice:\n1. Upgrade the conventional hard drive to an SSD immediately.  These are not expensive, and the procedure to do this can be found on YOUTUBE right here [...]  The cost may be as little as $60.00\n2. Upgrade the RAM to 8 GB.  The manufacturer suggests that the maximum amount of storage for this unit is 4 GB, but that is actually that is not true.  The procedure to replace the RAM is located here on YOUTUBE [...]  The cost will be about $26.00.\n\nWith these 2 upgrades, this computer becomes a relatively fast work-horse.  Microsoft products launch very quickly, and day-to-day web browsing is good.  If you don't purchase this, a like-wise laptop with a Pentium chip, 4 GB of RAM and 11.6 monitor is usually available in some form on sale from this site or Best Buy at around 350-400 range.  Best of luck."}

Every once in a while the mouse would go haywire and the laptop would shut off when it went to sleep.  Fast forward a few months and it is largely unusable.  The battery doesn't last at all, after 10-15 minutes of use, the mouse does whatever it wants which unfortunately is often closing out windows, minimizing windows, opening apps and even turning off whenever it wants.  If it goes to sleep at all then it turns off, period.  Not to mention, turning it on is a huge hassle.  It has to be plugged in for it to boot and even then it takes 5-10 tries for it to actually boot up.\n\nDO NOT BUY THIS LAPTOP unless you enjoy wasting $400 because that's all that will happen.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF3M", "review": "While this computer has lots of nice features like tablet mode (which is impossible if you use a case), these are far outweighed by a number of issues.\n\n1. First and foremost, the keyboard is junk. 1/3 of my keys stopped working within 3 months of owning it. It was covered by the warranty, but as my primary work computer I had to buy another computer for the 4 week repair time. And then the keys shorted out after one year of ownership, right after the warranty expired. Mind you, this was as my secondary computer--it was only lightly used from 3 months until it broke again at a year.\n\n2. The computer is remarkably slow given its components. Programs freeze while running only Microsoft Word and the internet browser. I play MTGO (a card game with extremely limited animations) and need to close all other programs to play it (and it still freezes periodically). And I have high speed internet and have no issues with other devices, so it definitely seems to be this computer.\n\n3. The touchpad frequently stops working, making me have to restart the computer. I've tried to update drivers, and nothing has worked. And Microsoft customer service wants $99.99 to help with even mundane issues, so don't expect any free assistance.\n\n4. Admittedly, the computer ran better when I was running Microsoft 8. Then I made the unfortunate error of upgrading to Microsoft 10, something this computer apparently cannot handle. Something called a \"compressed memory process\" (a known and much-heralded \"innovation\" in Microsoft 10) now runs constantly (you cannot stop it) and takes up 75%-100% of my memory about once every hour--which then causes everything on the computer to freeze up.\n\nIn summary, only buy this computer if you want headaches.\n\nEdit: 1 year 5 months into ownership now and the wireless adapter failed--I can no longer connect to Wifi because of this internal component failure. I don't know if it's planned obsolescence or just cheap manufacturing, but any $400 computer that has a major breakdown every 3 months is completely unacceptable. Never again, Dell."}

The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is because I should have known that selecting the cheap option would get me lower quality.\n\nPROS:\nI was able to access the internet and browse with relative ease as long as I didn't open too many windows or programs at the same time.  I was also able to do work on MS Word, Excel, and PowerPoint without too many issues.\n\nCONS:\nTrackpad - The trackpad absolutely stinks.  It would often stop working for no discernible reason and I had to troubleshoot by attaching a USB mouse, using the touchscreen, or by restarting.  The trackpad sensitivity was also erratic.  Sometimes it wouldn't sense my finger for a couple seconds, other times it was super sensitive to my palm as I was typing and the cursor would move to a different part of the screen (which was extremely irritating when typing in a document).\n\nTouchscreen - The touchscreen also had major bugs. If the computer went to sleep on its own after inactivity, when I would wake it up again the touchscreen would malfunction and begin \"ghost clicking\" in random parts of the screen.  Sometimes it would happen rapidly across the top of the screen and close documents and other applications I was using. I lost several documents because the \"ghost clicking\" closed them before I could save. The only way to fix this bug was to put the laptop to sleep manually and then wake it up again.\n\nSpeed - Again, you get what you pay for so I'm not totally blaming the computer for this since it came as advertised, but I would have to wait a long time (30+ seconds) for applications to open.  30 seconds may not sound like a very long time, but when you are trying to open several applications in a row, that becomes several minutes before you can begin doing any work."}

Had problems with it almost immediately. 7 months after purchase, the touch screen and screen rotate are both non-functional, the sound increases to max on its own, and the USB ports are not recognized by the machine, so I can't access anything on my USBs. It also crashed when Windows 10 downloaded and I had to get Windows 8 reinstalled. DELL makes the worst garbage machines, and I'll never buy another DELL. Cheap garbage made in China. When I called customer support, they instructed me to take the battery out, which required unscrewing the base and having to make mechanical fixes myself. Why on earth is this necessary on such a young machine? DO NOT BUY  A DELL! These are the worst computers on the market, and customer support provides none."}

The touch screen would be engaged without me touching the screen and would frequently close tabs, click on bookmarked pages, and open programs without me even touching the screen.  A few months of this, was fixed by just putting the computer on sleep mode then re-opening it.  Then the keyboard started failing.  99% of the time I do not have access to the left part of the keyboard.  When I do, it takes multiple tries to get each key to engage and the EXACT right amount of pressure.  The keys feel the same as all the others, but the computer does not recognize them as being used. My password for just about everything had a \"1\" and an \"a\" in it.  This wasn't a problem for a while, as I would just open the touch keyboard.  However, now the touch keyboard is not accessible on my computer login page.  I had to change my password to something else in order to simply log in to my computer.

However, I've had problems with this product, from the start, and regret not going to the trouble to return it, while I still could.\n1. It came with an occasional glitchy problem with one of the keyboard buttons (I don't have a ton of free time to return stuff, so I didn't get around to doing it, immediately. It did seem to improve, within the return window, so I just held on to it).\n2. It has problems rebooting. This problem didn't develop, until later. I push the button to turn it on, the light comes on (indicating it's booting up) then the light just fades, and nothing happens. I've tried giving it more time between pushes, etc. Nothing works.  It can take anywhere from 5-15 tries. I don't even know why it successfully turns on, when it does, since there are no differences in how I'm pressing the button between those times, and the times it doesn't turn on. I looked it up, and apparently I am not alone in having this problem with the Dell Inspiron.\n3. It's very slow and freezes pretty regularly, on me. I basically just use this computer for Microsoft Word, email, and general Internet use (no spammy websites, either, I swear!), so I seriously cannot understand why it is so slow. It was pretty slow from the get-go, but has only gotten worse. I have an advanced version of Norton Anti-Virus, and run scans regularly, so I really don't think it's due to a virus. It's just a sub-par product, in my opinion.\n4. It seems to no longer charge, when the lap top is closed. I can leave it plugged in,ball night, but if I forgot to leave the screen open, it will have a dead battery, in the morning. While it does charge while open and turned on (IF I manage to turn it on, with the glitchy button it charges incredibly slow.\n\nAnyway, it might work great for you, but these are just a few of the glitches I've experienced. The rebooting thing has become a daily struggle. I need something more reliable, that I can use on the go. I regret purchasing it, refurbished, through Amazon, since there is no warranty or real support available to fix these problems. I will definitely be purchasing a different product, through a regular store, next time. I really feel like I got the wool pulled over my eyes, with this purchase, and I doubt any \"refurbishment\" of this product ever actually took place. It seems like the reviews on this product have gotten a bit worse, since the time I purchased it, so perhaps there is something to that."}

The screen started flickering and spent two hours on the phone with Dell support in India. Average wait time for support on the phone can be up to an hour, chat is almost that long. My husband, who is a Microsoft Certified Systems engineer contacted Dell about replacing the ridiculously slow hard drive with a solid state one. He was assured the computer would support a SSD. We bought one from Amazon, and he spent two days trying to get it to work. We returned that one and bought one directly from Dell, who once again assured us it would work. That was the end of October. He spent several more hours trying to get it to install, had Dell send us an operating system. Long story short, we had to return the drive, it was received over a week ago by Dell, verified, and their \"refund will be issued in 5-7 days is not quite accurate. I am now on a lengthy hold on the telephone to try to find our where my money is.\n\n We have had numerous issues with this computer, and only reported a couple of them to Dell since my husband is very adept and trouble shooting. The computer is still under warranty, so we told them we want a replacement under the warranty. They are willing to send us a refurbished one, not sure if it will be the same model or a different one. They are \"checking into that\" and promise to get back to me by the end of the week.

The keypad will jump like it's possessed and \"select\" whatever is in its path - doesn't matter if you're touching it or it's alone in a room - like some sort of vindictive demon, it will click and click and click until it has enlarged whatever window you're in so big and so repetitively that the whole system collapses. It prefers to do this when you're a) working on an important email or document, or b) coming up to a plot twist in a good movie you're watching.\n\nThis computer also enjoys notifying you that it will be restarting in X minutes for updates, but giving you NO CHOICE as to whether you'd like to update at that time. In the middle of an online chat group for work? Too bad, your computer will be shutting down for 20 minutes of updates in 10 minutes, better save your work, sucker. I hate this computer.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF3M", "review": "I wanted to like this laptop.  It is inexpensive, touchscreen, it has all the features my wife and children needed.  We bought one for my wife and another for my son.  My wife has had hers for about four months, we just got another for my son.  The worst feature for this is the USB ports.  They are very, very tight and they work on and off.  My wife started having problems about a week ago with her mouse dongle sporadically turning off and on.  This is the very short dongle not the long, so there is no possibility that it got caught on something.  When we got my son's laptop earlier last week, immediately after hour of the box when I was about to start setting it up for him, the same happened.  I immediately placed an exchange which arrive a few days later.  The same thing happened.  It is very frustrating because the laptop literally has been out of the box less than an hour.  The dongle works without any issues on my Surface 3, by the way  The USB port was almost impossible to be used due to how hard it was to get the dongle in and once it was in, it was hit or miss as to when it would work.  I wanted to like this laptop.  It is a great value for the features, but I'm afraid the hardware is subpar."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF3M", "review": "The keyboard is horrible. Worst I've ever used. Flimsywith waaaaaay too much flex and very poor tactile response. Like typing on ice that isn't cold. I regret buying the laptop strictly on that basis alone, because I do extensive writing and editing and pound a keyboard pretty vigorously. But I needed a computer ASAP and bought this the old-fashioned way at a Walmart brick and mortar, failing to appreciate how poor the keyboard is until it was too late. I should have looked at other models. My bad.\n\nThis replaces a failed Lenovo Thinkpad X120E, which had an awesome keyboard. What a night and day difference.\n\nLooking at the keyboard picture on Amazon, I see that the pictured keyboard layout is different than on my model, though it too is a 3147. Most notably, I find that on my laptop the Page Up, Page Down, Home and End keys all require the use of the Function key! Argh. What a horrible design. I use those keys extensively and to have to deal with the Fn key to work them is proving to be a major annoyance. Again, in my haste to get a new PC, I overlooked that unfortunate knucklehead design in this machine... in fact I've never seen it on another keyboard and didn't even notice it until I got home and started using the laptop.\n\nApart from that, it seems like a nice enough PC. I've had good luck with Dells in the past, and will have to learn to deal with the lame keyboard. Bottom line, if you are going to type extensively on this laptop, or a quality keyboard is important to you, I'd look elsewhere."}

This is from me just typing and resting my left wrist and palm on the laptop. Another user on Amazon has experienced a crack in the same exact area so I think this is a manufacturing/design flaw.\n\nThe laptop was still under warranty so I called Dell customer service.  I was told that Dell's warranty only covers hardware and software but the palm rest doesn't qualify as hardware.  I responded that a computer is made of either physical parts (e.g. hardware) or software so how can that be?!  After 2 hours of being put on hold and transferred 4 times, I was finally transferred to someone who just didn't answer a single question I asked - I think he was reading from a script.  He said that he handled service tickets for printers and scanners.  The automated prompt when I spoke with this person mentioned that I had been transferred to a call center for another company called one \"something\".  I asked the rep for what company he handles tickets and he asked me what company I work for!  Mind baffling.  I told him that doesn't matter.  Then I asked him if he handles laptops from Dell and he said he handles Zebra brand printers and scanners.  I hung up after I asked to speak to a supervisor and was treated the same way again after being put on hold."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF3M", "review": "This computer is absolutely impossible! It does what ever it wants not what you want!\nThe worst!\nDon't have time for the B.S.!"}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF3M", "review": "Words just aren't adequate to describe how much I despise this computer. Having owned more than a dozen fabulous computers going back to my trusty Tandy 1000EX in the mid-1980's (where you had to swap floppy disks just to run the Microsoft DOS operating system), if this is the direction computers are going in the 21st century, this product has tempted me to abandon computers from my life altogether.\n\nIn summary, the basic problems with the Dell Inspiron 11 are that it 1) makes getting nearly anything you want to do done nearly impossible, and 2) it keeps doing things I don't want it to do because of the terrible input system and Windows operating system, and its commitment to tracking and tracing everything you do (of course, only to \"help\" you... Big Brother is your friend, remember? He said so).\n\nSpecifically,\n\n1) The touchpad is so large and sensitive (even after adjustment) that it constantly triggers when you don't want it to. So while you're just typing along, suddenly, you find yourself typing on a different part of the page, or on a different page altogether. Or, after typing a long email and carefully editing it, your palm barely touches the thing and the email you just spent 1/2 hour writing just disappears altogether, never to be seen again in this dimension of existence. Or you send emails that aren't yet finished, making you look like a fool to the recipient. Or you suddenly jump off to a website you had no intention of visiting. Or any number of other unexpected and unwanted outcomes which never occurred using previous computers.\n\nAlso, the touchpad just stops working sometimes, until after you reboot some random number of times. And I have yet to find a USB mouse that works reliably with this machine.\n\n2) Similarly, the touch-screen is more trouble than it's worth. It gets stained and smeared with fingerprints and food, and sometimes it just stops working altogether. Then, suddenly, after you reboot X number of times, it just starts working again... for a while. Touch it when you didn't mean to and you can lose your work, send an unfinished email that you're editing, or accidentally fly off to a website of dubious security. I will never get a PC with a touchscreen again.\n\n3) The 2-in-1 aspect is why I got the touchscreen. But once you try using something this large as a tablet, all folded up with a fragile, easily-smeared, easily-broken glass screen on one side and a sensitive keyboard on the other side, you finally realize how ridiculous it is to use this brick as a tablet.\n\n4) The keyboard is crammed and insensible, and after a few months the letter \"n\" required twice as much force to trigger as any other key. The tactile response feels cheap and unreliable. If your fingernails are even slightly long, this keyboard is unusable. (I keep my nails on my right hand for playing guitar).\n\n5) The computer casing is small, thin and stylish, but that's actually a bad thing. This machine is heavy for its size, and slippery. The odds of dropping it or squeezing it too hard and breaking the touch-screen glass are just too high. I have to treat this computer with kid gloves to avoid damaging it and that just adds another concern that I never had with any previous desktop or laptop computer.\n\n6) Around 50-75% of the time when you move the mouse toward the right-hand side of the screen, some idiotic sidebar menu slides out and screws up whatever your doing. Just moving the mouse away doesn't get rid of it, either - you have to click somewhere on the page. And if you click in the wrong place to get rid of this menu, *wham*, whatever you were working on is gone forever, you just sent an unfinished email, or you travel to an unknown website, or.....\n\n7) Dell SupportAssist and Dell Backup interrupts what you're doing constantly, with popup windows. I never asked for these, never wanted them, have no use for them. So why are they interrupting my work? When did I ask Dell to install software that interrupts my work? It must be in the fine print somewhere.\n\n8) Windows 8 is just the most god-awful operating system I have ever encountered. It's an excruciatingly dumbed-down version of an already inferior operating system, apparently designed to appeal to dumbed-down children who haven't the foggiest idea how computers work at low levels. It's like a giant \"smart\" phone more than a computer. Yet, when I installed the free Windows 10 upgrade to get rid of that childish interface, the End User License Agreement for Windows 10 appears to say that Microsoft now collects information on EVERYTHING you type and do, stores it permanently, and shares that information effectively with anyone who asks for it. It seems that Microsoft is now a part of the U.S. Government. Maybe that is why, after being sued by the government for being unable to remove Windows Internet Explorer years ago, Windows 10 includes a bunch of software (including Explorer) that you cannot uninstall - and the government suddenly isn't suing them over it anymore... THINK about that. Carefully. There's a reason why the Windows 10 upgrade is free.\n\nBecause of that I reverted back to that god-awful operating system, Windows 8, and then had to delete all of those useless tiles all over again. Seriously, why would big tiles linking to \"food and drink,\" \"health\" and \"sports\" be the default for an operating system, unless Dell/Microsoft assume that their customers are mindless dolts and slaves of popular culture (versus using a computer for productive WORK). Why would I ever want to see a picture of Justin Bieber, Kim Kardashian, NASCAR, something from television, Barack Obama, or any other sign of the New Dark Age Of Humanity on my computer immediately upon bootup? I bought a computer so I could get WORK done, not to check up on what irrelevant celebrities and trend-setters are doing.\n\nWhen reverting back to an inferior product is a vast improvement in security and flexibility, *something* is dreadfully wrong. Yet I had to revert to this nonsense to avoid the Windows 10 EULA consequences.\n\n9) This laptop doesn't seem to work well with Linux. I tried installing several Linux distributions dual-booting with Windows, and they freeze up or otherwise behave erratically. Yet installing free Linux is traditionally the best way to revive an old dusty computer and give it a new lease on life, so you don't have to throw it away. Obviously, that won't happen with this laptop. This computer is destined for a landfill.\n\n10) From almost the day I bought this I have frequently gotten a popup window error telling me that I have plugged in the wrong power supply for this computer, when I have only plugged in the power supply that came with this computer.\n\n11) This computer is slower than molasses flowing uphill in January. There is a significant delay after almost every command you give it. Often, that delay is so great that you \"try again,\" and then it suddenly processes two commands. Just type a paragraph, and the machine suddenly freezes and stops displaying what you're typing, and then just dumps a bunch of text all at once a few moments later. The result? You lose data, send unfinished emails, fly off to websites you never intended to visit, and so on.\n\nThis computer is all but unusable for any purpose except surfing the internet without the benefit of knowing just how dangerous the internet really is. This is the first computer I've ever owned that seems to control me, rather than the other way around. It terrifies me to think that this is the direction computers are headed. I can't even calculate the lost productivity I've suffered because of this computer. I cringe every time I have to use it. Yet I'm now scared to replace it with a new one if this is where these products are headed. At this point my only option is to buy an older laptop used and install Linux.\n\nShame on the computer industry. You used to be so great."}

Its light, easy to travel with, seems sturdy, allows her to do all the things she needs to do on a day to day basis. She also loves to read and has found flipping it to the use as a touchscreen and reading through the kindle app a nice alternative to her kindle. She/I have no complaints as of yet, and as an avid apple fanboy I admit I was skeptical of purchasing her a dell but I am thoroughly surprised and pleased with the purchase thus far!\n\nA few things I was nervous about when purchasing this computer where the touchscreen, the keyboard when it is in touchscreen mode, and it's durability. She is relatively accident prone and not the most gentle with this computer at time's however it has withstood its abuse and has held up nicely so far."}

It had unusual glitches after it would go to sleep and then wake up where there would be 4 or 5 'touch dots' moving all over the screen as if i were touching buttons on the screen.  The second one, i discovered was connected to the facial recognition system.  I uninstalled that app and it works fine, better than I believed it would for the price.  The one star off is because of the faulty first one.  What are the chances that others have faulty hardware?  I don't know.  I'm using the second one quite a bit now and it's very responsive and has no power issues like the first one did.\n\nUPDATE----------\n7 Weeks later, the second computer sent from amazon to replace the defective one gave the same hardware errors.  It's almost 3 weeks after the amazon return window so now I have to deal with Dell's foreign support team, which is something of a nightmare in itself.  They said they want me to send it to them to repair and send back to me.  It is not ideal to have them do surgery on a brand new computer and give it back to me, as it clearly is defective, but that is the only option they offer.  I'm left with the feeling that they are making disposable computers, meant to last a very short time.\n\nWhile the computer was working, it was working great, but for two identical computer models to share the same exact same problem within 7 weeks of each other is a very unlikely coincidence.  The laptops were never used as tablets and never left the air-conditioned living room or moved more than 5 feet, from the table to the sofa.  The problem is not only with the power supply, it also is within the computer because another Dell cable did not fix the problem."}

But I was desperate and it was the cheapest computer I could find and happened to be the only one in stock and ordering a new one would have cost me a minimum of two weeks wait time. I couldn't afford that. I am an IT major and am required a laptop for Java and programming. That's essentially all it is used and needed for. The day I bought it, I found the system has many many flaws. It flips screens at the slide of a finger across the mouse pad which pulls me away from an exam I am in the middle of, the mouse pad doesn't work sometimes, then the touch screen doesn't work sometimes, switching from tablet to desktop doesn't work because the screen and mouse like to not work. So a good portion of the time I can't do anything with the damn thing because not only can I not use the mouse to type, but the touch screen won't work. Reiterating myself, apologies. If I go to use it for more than 20 minutes (During an exam) the mouse diverts to the top right corner of the screen and repeatedly clicks without my hand doing so and minimizing my screen and screwing up my quizzes and exams. This cheap computer is just that. a cheap peace of hardware and malfunctioning software. I'm a programmer and I don't even want to mess with this thing. Constant updates without my permission cause me to lose homework in the middle of it, then it turns on after 30 minutes at least of doing the update and the updates never fix the problems! Whoever wrote the programming for this computer probably should look into a new profession.\nThis computer has never been dropped, bumped, or spilled anything on. And lets face it, any programming major knows that a computer needs security protection of obviously, mine has it and I monitor it. My advice, fix the software AND test it before trying to make your buck. Thanks for the *cheap* computer. If I hadn't needed the computer the next day for my classes, I would have taken the worthless thing back.\nDefinitely not going with Dell next time regardless of it being this particular computer or any other dell. It's ruined it for me."}

Bought refurbished but in good shape, marked 'new' on dell outlet.\nI'd give 3.5 stars, though.\n\nCurrently traveling with it. Like the weight and easy handling. Battery life is good. No Ethernet though.\n\nMemory replacement was easy. CRUCIAL CT2KIT102464BF160B added 8GB in 2 mins.\n\nDisk cloning doesn't work unless you have a recent BIOS. My power connector pin broke down early so the battery was <10% and then it can't update BIOS. I had to wait for a Dell person to come and bring me a new power adapter. Silly, if you ask me. Reinstalling from the OS disk works best. Inexpensive 1TB Crucial M500 works well so far.\n\nIt's a powerful thing but the touchpad can sometimes drive me nuts. You move the cursor around and it invokes all menus and clicks all buttons on the way. Afraid to buy something I don't want. Poor design. Touchscreen helps sometimes but finger touches are often imprecise.\n\nThe power connector is unlike other Dells. Another minus. (And it breaks, remember)\n\nScreen fades unexpectedly sometimes (have somewhat similar pattern on the other Dell, which went nuts - it only recognizes the keyboard after a login with a virtual one and then making PC to sleep and wake up - I wonder who programmed that weird behavior?!?)\n\nIt has a large piece of plastic tape glued to the bottom.

Unfortunately, I've had the computer for about 8 months, and I've already sent it back to Dell five times to get various problems fixed. Today, less than a week after I got it back from Dell's technical support, the computer locked up and started making a high-pitched whine. I was actually kind of excited, because I've had a bunch of other problems with this computer - the battery's failed multiple times, the hard drive has failed multiple times, the screen is getting discolored, there are several dead pixels Dell will not fix, the sound sometimes starts acting up (sounds like a skipping CD or something), and the battery plug-in is very poorly designed - but it's never made funny noises before! (I have to find the bright side of this piece of junk somehow.) Basically, as soon as I get the computer working again, it will have some other problem and I'll have to send it in to tech support.\n\nBut, if the constant hardware problems aren't bad enough, the computer also does not perform very well. It frequently goes through periods of several minutes where it locks up and needs to think; I'm not doing anything too strenuous, usually just listening to music, browsing the internet, and maybe typing up a Word document. There is no reason for the computer to need to spend as much as three minutes sitting contemplating whether it will perform an action (or crash). Additionally, when I open a new program (or a new browser tab), the computer often takes several minutes to start the program/browser up. This computer is not that old; it should not have that much difficulty performing simple actions.\n\nI'm trying to think of good things to say about this computer. It is cool looking, and I do get compliments on it. I find the flip screen handy. It's small, light, and portable. And, for the first month or so, it did work pretty quickly. But it's been such a disappointment, and I've had so many problems. As I said above, it's very possible that I just got a bad model. But I bought and paid for the computer and Dell refuses to replace it, so, telling me I have a lemon doesn't do me any good. And, if you buy this laptop, you might very possibly get a lemon as well - a lemon that Dell will not replace and which you will have to send in for repairs every month or so."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF3M", "review": "I bought this nice little laptop for my wife.  She was using a notepad to read her emails but found it frustrating to answer them using only a touchscreen. This little computer is basically a touchscreen notepad with a keyboard attached.  It's very lightweight, very portable and versatile. She likes using the touchscreen to read her emails using one of the new Windows 8.1 apps called TouchMail, but she uses the keyboard to reply and it is much easier than using the on-screen keyboard.  We disabled to on-screen keyboard so that it wouldn't automatically come up each time you touch an input on the screen.\nNow for the big con: We bought this in October of 2014 and from the time we started using it the touchscreen would become partially unresponsive when waking up from sleep.  The computer would be working just fine and then we would come back some hours later and the touchscreen just wouldn't respond for most operations.  Shutting the computer down and starting it back up would always fix it but that was annoying.  Being new to a laptop and also Windows 8.1, I thought this was a software issue and tried over several months to update drivers and BIOS, and change settings to correct this issue. One time the mouse started slowly moving by itself across the screen and opening things making the computer unusable. I finally contacted Dell support. The Dell tech took remote control of the comptuer and attempted repairs using software.  This did not resolve the problem so Dell sent me a pre-paid box and shipped the computer to their repair center.  They replaced the LCD panel touchscreen and sent it back to us at no charge.  This fixed all of the touchscreen problems and our computer has been working wonderfully ever since. So the moral of the story is that if you are experiencing touchscreen or mousepad issues please contact Dell support and they will correct the issue for you.  They sent emails to let us know what was going on and also contacted us afterward to make sure that the issue was resolved to our satisfaction."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF3M", "review": "In this review I will go over some of the things about this laptop I will then go over what I really like about the laptop and what I don't like after that I will explain who this laptop is for and if its worth to buy. If you don't really care about any of the things I said then please don't waste your time reading this review but if this interest you then please keep on reading. I also welcome any comments or questions!! :)\n\nSo I have had this laptop for almost 2 weeks, it defiantly has some flaws but with that being said I think the things this laptop has to offer outweigh its draw backs. First of all I did not get what I paid for. I was suppose to get the one with the Pentium processor (4 cores) but instead I got the one with the Celeron processor (2 cores). I did not demand a refund because the upgrades alone are worth about $130.00 so I decided to keep it. The laptops hard drive has been upgraded to a (Crucial MX 100) 256 GB SSD and the wifi card has been upgraded to a duel band wifi card. I found out that this laptop is great for bringing with me to places because its 11.6 inches instead of 15.6 inches like most laptops but just because this laptop is small don't mean it feels small when you use it or by any means slow because this laptop is surprisingly fast once you adjust some settings. (Keep in mind my laptop had been upgraded to a SSD so your experience may vary if you are using the stock hard drive.) This laptop is great for surfing the web, watching HD videos from YouTube, working with Microsoft office and playing some casual games like Halo or plants vs zombies. I have noticed that I get about 4 to 5 hours of battery life which is good for a Windows machine since most only get about 3 hours. One other thing I have noticed is when I use Internet Explorer my cpu usage in task manager goes up to about 80% from 10% thats a 70% increase! Sometimes it gets all the way up to 100%. I am not for sure if its just me or if it happens to other people to. The thing is ever since I have installed Google chrome the cpu usage hovers around 20% to 60% and only uses about 70 MB of ram which is great. I do really enjoy the touch screen. I did not want a laptop with Windows 8 if it did not have a touch screen because trying to use Windows 8 without a touchscreen sucks. I have noticed the touch screen driver does have some bugs I say this because most of the time when I am watching something on YouTube and I have it play in full screen after I am done and I exit out of full screen the touch screen does not register when I tap on it so I end up having to minimize my window and then maximize it for the touch screen to realize I am done. Its not anything that makes me want to throw my laptop at a wall but it is defiantly annoying! I love the keyboard and track pad! They are the best I have used in a Windows laptop. The keyboards keys are a little soft and rubbery but not to soft. It feels very good typing on its much better then typing on something thats just hard plastic. The keyboard is one of many reasons why I love this laptop. The track pad is great to. I can scroll pretty well with it. Sometimes it does not register when I try scrolling but for it being a Windows laptop you cant expect it to be like a Macbooks track pad. The left and right clicking function works well its not to hard to push down and it feels pretty solid when you press it. Using the laptop in tablet mode is awesome. One reason I wanted the 11.6 inch Dell 2 in 1 over the 13.3 inch 2 in 1 version is because the smaller version has bigger boarders around the screen making it easier to hold without touching the screen also the 13 inch model would be harder to use in tablet mode since it is bigger and heavier. The last thing I want to say about the laptop is that the build quality is fantastic. It looks and feels like a premium laptop. Some people even think it feels like aluminum.\n\nThe pros\n(A great keyboard and trackpad) There would be no point in having a laptop if the keyboard or trackpad were hard to use. It would make the user experience terrible.\n(Good build quality) you feel like you get more for what you paid for. The laptop don't feel like itll break anytime soon.\n(More then one function) Having the ability to use your laptop as a tablet not only makes it very portable but also makes it really fun to use.\n(Viewing angles are superb) Colors look great. The screen looks good from just about any angle.\n(Slim) This laptop is not even a inch think. I think this would be considered as a ultra book. Another thing that makes this portable.\n(Battery life) Battery life is good for a Windows machine. I get about 5 hours which almost last me the day.\n(Overall speed) You get a speedy laptop in a small package. Much much better then any other $350.00 laptop I have used.\n(Ports) Great amount of ports. 3 USB ports, (one being usb 3.0) 1 FULL HDMI port, a SD card reader and microphone/headphone jack.\n(Loud and clear built in speakers) These speakers can get very loud but don't sound bad at all when turned all the way up\n\nThe cons\n(Touch screen driver) Sometimes the touch screen does not register my fingers when I am trying to use it. (Very annoying)\n(Trackpad) Sometimes the trackpad don't work when I boot up the laptop. For some reason I have to put the laptop in portrait mode and then back into landscape mode for it allow me to use the trackpad. I am sure this is a driver issue to. (Very weird)\n(Hard drive interface) This laptop uses sata II interface!! Not sata III. I would think every laptop today uses sata III. Why Dell decided to use sata II is beyond me.\n(Memory upgrade options) The laptop only has one slot to upgrade the memory. This is a minor drawback because even if you were able to upgrade to 16 GB of memory there wouldnt be much use for it since the laptop don't have the graphics to handle huge games or tons of video editing.\n\nConclusion\nThis is a great little laptop. I think this laptop will suit most of the peoples needs and what I mean by most people is someone who plans to use it for surfing the web, light gaming like halo or gameboy emulation, typing essays or making power points also someone who likes thin and light laptops that can also transform into a tablet.  I also think sound editing would work good on this to. I am not someone who edits sound but I have played with a piece of software called FL studio and it works good. This laptop is not for someone who wants to Video edit 1080 or 4k videos (480p or maybe even 720p I think would be fine) or someone who plans on playing games like Battle field or Skyrim because this laptop will lag bad. I gave this laptop a 4 out 5 because the touch screen and trackpad drivers do have minor bugs which can be annoying to deal with. I think for the price its more then worth it because it can serve more then one porpoise. Its light weight, it can be used as a tablet and a laptop.\n\nPS: If you see this laptop sell at Walmart for $500.00 or even $450.00 Dont buy it! You can buy this laptop new for $400.00 on here (Amazon)\nI bought mine used for $330.00 and it came with a 256 GB SSD and upgraded wifi card."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF3M", "review": "I bought this laptop after seeing attractive features like HD screen, 2in1 (tab convertible) etc. But, I deeply regret for buying this one. There are some inherent problems with this model, or this laptop sold online as \"NEW\" are \"REFURBISHED\". Buyers, BEWARE!. Please get some cheaper tablets rather than buying this one.\n\n1) Sound card issue - Within a fortnight purchase, I got an issue where speakers started producing crackling sound while playing movie/songs. But, it stopped when I started using next time. But, this kind of intermittent problems continued every 20 days or so. It worked once after restarting.\n\n2) Sound Volume drops to ZERO automatically without any control - After a month of purchase, every 20 days or so, sound volume automatically dropped to \"ZERO\" level. I tried all ways and at last it worked only after restarting. So, whenever I face this issue, I had to restart.\n\n3) Microphone issue during Skype calls - During Skype, either caller or opposite party hear some thudding noise in background (even though both caller and opposite party was speaking in quiet room). In addition, both parties hear echo. This problem is happening whenever I use Skype. This problem started to happen after 3 months of purchase.\n\nWhen I reported this problem to DELL support, they mentioned that it is not issue with hardware and mentioned as driver issue. Further, I was shocked to hear from support that I had to shell out 200 dollars (for one year support) or 110 dollars for one time support. Though DELL website has web page for drivers, installing those didn't work. It looks like DELL intentionally remove drivers so that buyers had no choice other than approaching them for the exact driver. BUYERS, FIRST THING YOU NEED TO DO IS TO GO AND CHECK FROM \"DEVICE MANAGER\" AND SEE IF THERE ARE ANY \"UNKNOWN DEVICES\". IF IT IS SHOWN, THEN THE REQUIRED DRIVERS ARE NOT INSTALLED IN THIS LAPTOP. By not pre-installing the drivers, DELL finds a way to squeeze money from buyer pocket.\n\n4) Windows 8.1 issue - In Windows 8.1, Microsoft forces to create Outlook account for accessing any APPS. If you log into/create Outlook account, then from next time log onwards, you necessarily have to key in Network SSID to log into computer. When you are struck in a place without internet/wifi connection, then you cannot log into computer. This is a stupid move from Microsoft forcing users to use One password, i.e Outlook for accessing APPS in Windows 8.1. After getting locked, I had to use smartphone as wifi hotspot to change from Outlook account to normal user account. But, if you want to access pre-installed apps, then there is no choice other than logging through Outlook account. Microsoft, I think is competing with GOOGLE in one password for all segment. At least, GOOGLE was doing it for Internet access only. But, it is pity that MSFT forces users to lock into OUTLOOK account for even logging into computer. BUYER, DON\"T FALL PREY INTO WINDOWS 8.1. If you are still buying/using Windows 8.1, then create only local account so that you won't be trapped when there is no internet connection.\n\nSo, BUYERS, DO YOU FALL PREY INTO DELL AND MICROSOFT TRAP?\n\nI think, now a days DELL is no more a good choice for laptop purchase, I feel we can rely on LENOVO for laptop purchase. If you are not interested in Lenovo, then it is better to skip the idea of buying this DELL model and look out TAB with 8 inche size rather than wasting money on DELL laptop.\n\nAll said and done, I gave 2 star is only because of the only consolation aspect that this laptop has HD screen. But, now a days many laptops/tablets come out with HD screen."}

However within the first 36 hours my speaker started to go. My Amazon seller was very helpful and as well was Dell tech support. That's why I went with dell. They have great customer service (and my old dell inspiron lasted 6 years). The problem they said was the motherboard, luckily its under warranty and could easily be fixed for free. But is it worth it? I don't know. The keyboard is nice, the touch screen is good.\nWhen I put the laptop into tablet mode the first time and put it back to laptop mode I lost my cursor and had to restart it. Not sure why.\nThis laptop though gets 2 stars though because I had problems within the first 36 hours. Ill get another model and try it again.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF3M", "review": "I would give this Dell 2-in-1 (Pentium quad-core version) 4.5 stars if that were an option  it's almost perfect for me.  I've been wanting another compact laptop for a while, especially for travel, so the sleek appearance of this is what originally caught my attention.  Been using it for several months now and really, really like it.  I understand the internal configuration isn't designed for heavy gaming and such.  Even though I'm only a casual user, doing mostly basic computing tasks, I still want a laptop that performs well.  Here are my thoughts and observations so far:\n\nSeveral reviews claim this machine is slow, and a few noted that after a short while, performance seemed to improve.  This was my experience also.  During that first day, I was pretty certain I'd be returning this model.  I had cleaned it up of unwanted programs, didn't load it down with new ones, and didn't install a heavy security program.  Yet, it didn't behave new and snappy, I was extremely disappointed.  However, a day or so later, things seemed to clear up and from then on it's been fine.  The likely cause of this is all the Windows and Dell updating the computer goes through when it's fresh out of the box (there were 50+ Windows updates needed on mine, plus driver updates).  Therefore, new owners, be patient and don't give up on it too quickly.  Run the Windows Update (and restart) a few times before doing anything else.  Beyond that, I haven't had any issues with the other recurring complaints:  Wi-Fi stays connected (but I am not currently using bluetooth); touchpad works fine after some personal pref adjustments; touch screen responds relatively well to taps and swipes (after calibrating), has pervasive function, and rotates properly in tablet mode; LCD is clear and bright; hard drive seems fine; it's a little warm at the rear but not hot; power cord is recognized and charges quickly (though I did see the dreaded non-Dell warning on the in-store unit I inspected); decent battery life; hinges are sturdy and functional; keyboard and all keys are fine (little bit of flex).  Can't comment on the camera, haven't used it.\n\nIn addition to all that, here's what I like about this particular laptop:\n1) The 2-in-1 feature!  Very portable laptop + a large tablet in one unit.  Because it's so thin, it folds nicely into tablet mode, albeit heavier/larger than a typical tablet.  No question, Android apps selection is better, but leaving my tablet home and having one less thing to carry on a plane is OK by me.  No more bulky laptop bag, this easily fits into a mid-size shoulder bag or purse.\n2) I have never been disappointed with Dell.  Every Dell product I've owned, and there have been many, has out-performed and out-lived all the others.\n3) This is a very upgrade-friendly unit, particularly for a novice.  I've decided to swap out the HDD for a SSD for these reasons:  less chance for disk damage, less heat, more energy efficient (aka battery life), and faster boot/response times.  Additionally, the wireless LAN card can be upgraded to dual band (recommended if you plan to use bluetooth) and the RAM can be upgraded from 4 to 8GB (single stick).  There are how-to videos available on YouTube depicting these upgrades.\n4) This is the first time I've not immediately reached for a wireless mouse.  The touch pad works surprisingly well for me and is very customizeable.  That, along with the touch screen, makes navigation easy.\n5) Many folks dislike Windows 8.  While I don't love it, I am adapting, primarily because of the touch screen which makes Win8 a bit more bearable.  If this were a standard laptop, I'd probably install one of those programs that cause the OS to look and run like Win7 (such as Classic Shell or Start8).  For instruction on how to use Win8, go to the Microsoft website, they have some getting started videos that are helpful.\n6) Some aren't  happy with the placement of the power button (on the side), but I actually quite like it.  This allows the pc to function nicely as a desktop / work-station unit (in conjunction with an HDMI compatible monitor, wireless keyboard and mouse).  Just turn off the sleep response to a closed lid.  This feature is something I've long been looking for in a laptop.\n7) It runs VERY quiet (and basically silent with the SSD installed).  Even the fan isn't very noisy.\n\nA few things to note:  There is no optical drive, you'll need to use an external drive or download your software from the net.  An iPearl Mcover hard shell is probably a good idea, this model is said to scratch easily.  There are also skins available that can help protect the top cover and palm rest area (esp when in tablet mode).  I left the clear adhesive film on the bottom cover for protection of that surface.\n\nA few complaints:  That initial sluggish behavior is, understandably, off-putting. Aside from that, my PC runs very smoothly with ONE exception - the 'automatic' Windows updates still bog down the system, no other programs or processes have this effect (this was remedied with the SSD upgrade). Occasionally, my touchpad won't recognize two-finger swipes for page scrolling and I have to use the touch screen instead (which turns out to work better, but still).  Wish there was a Fn-key for quicker enabling/disabling of the touchpad.  The touch screen is sometimes less responsive in tablet mode compared to the same actions made in laptop mode.  Also, the touch screen won't recognize some check-box and dialog-box taps, forces me to use the touchpad and pointer.  When in tablet mode, the LCD dims and brightens for no reason (with no obstruction or interference to the sensor).  The touch screen is not stylus-friendly at all, add the matte screen protector that I applied and my stylus has been rendered completely useless.  New users -- definitely go to the Dell website and update your drivers, particularly for the touchscreen and touchpad.\n\nUPDATE / UPGRADES:\n#1 After receiving the Samsung 850 EVO SSD ($100), I cloned my HDD using the included software (via an external optical drive).  Many advise the use of better cloning software, but being inexperienced, I opted to adhere to the manufacturers directions for my first time.  Everything went fine.  Follow the directions provided and consult online instructional videos if needed.  But before you begin the upgrade, I suggest that you first create a bootable backup onto a flash drive via the Dell Backup and Recovery app.  The Samsung migration software does NOT clone the recovery partition of the HDD for some reason (others consistently report this and my experience was the same).  That said --  I can attest to the much improved function and performance of the new SSD over the original HDD.  Applications and programs engage quickly, pages load faster.  From being completely powered down, start-up takes about 10 seconds to completely up and running, shut-down takes about 5 seconds to lights-off.  Also, the amount of heat generated near the rear of the unit feels to be only about half as much as before.  Highly recommend this upgrade!\n#2  Never had any issue maintaining an internet connection, but speed test results for this laptop were only about half that of my other PC's (a laptop and a desktop, both wireless).  So I purchased and installed a dual-band wireless card.  The cost was under $30 and it brought the speeds up to par with my other PC's.  Another recommended upgrade.  Just be sure to buy the proper item:  \"7260NGW Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC\"  (802.11ac  Wi-Fi + Bluetooth 4.0).  Be careful with cheaper options, some don't have bluetooth.\n#3  I went several months using the original 4GB of on board RAM before deciding to upgrade.  The main reason for doing so is because the Samsung SSD that I installed has a RAPID Mode feature that uses 4GB of RAM all on its own.  Also, my word processing program was a little slow to engage and I use it frequently.  After installing an 8GB RAM stick ($38), everything is engaging and running even faster."}

I changed the standard HDD for a 240GB SSD and this extends battery life, speeds up the computer, and makes the computer less sensitive to bumps, etc.  The touch screen hesitates at times and the touch pad also isn't always the most responsive, but I'm not sure whether this is the fault of Win8.1 the program or the computer, but all-in-all I'm enjoying it.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF3M", "review": "I had a 6 year old HP that was clearly heavy and getting slower.  I really was looking for something that was far more portable and lighter to be able to carry around in my briefcase.  Secondly, I wanted something that would last some hours before needing to be recharged.\n\nI looked at a number of different computers, including a Macbook and a similar Toshiba.  But, I found thi\n\ns Dell and began to research opinions about this computer.  This research included professional reviews and Amazon reviews which really gave goood marks to this computer.\n\nMy criteria?  Lightweight.  Long battery life.  A good keyboard.  Ease of use.\n\n1.  What's in the box:?  You receive the computer and the charging cable.\n\n2. Aesthetic:?  This is a nice looking computer.  Though thee similar Toshiba has that nice looking gold color, which I think is still nicer, this Dell has a high tech silver appearance.  The computer itself is quite thin nature.  The screen has a nice black bezel which matches the chiclet type keyboard.  I would say this is a nice looking professional computer that looks and presents a very nice image.\n\n3.  Use?:  I wss impressed with the ease of set-up.  This system has Windows 8.1, which I don't love but requires a lot of customization to reduce what I think is a lot of ticky tack stuff.  Another nice thing is the computer does not have a lot of bloat ware beyond the McAfee virus protection software which I never use.\n\nOnce I set-up the computer, let me describe the performance.  This is a pretty snappy machine.  I have noticed after some adjustment, the computer performance gets better.  First off, turning off the anti-virus provided helps.  Second, I modified the trackpad by turning off most features.  I think thhiss is important because though I think the trackpad here is actually pretty good, Windows will drive you insane with all the bopping out to a different window.  In addition, you can modify Windows so that it starts in familiar desktop mode.\n\nNow, the computer has enough juice to bring up and respond multiple windows and programs.  I have only rarely encountered a stall because the processor couldn't handle something.\n\nThe screen is really nice and the colors pop very well.  The keyboard feels good.  There is limited flex in the middle of the keyboard.  However, the keyboard is responsive and has a nice feeling.\n\nThe touchscreen is a nice feature that I have begun to use from time to time and I am glad it is there.  And this leads to another feature.  This computer can be turned into a tablet.  Though I haven't used it very much for that, the hinges are reassuringly robust and the hinge action is quite easy.  Plus, the screen really moves around quite easily to accommodate this feature.  As well, the keyboard shuts off so you can easily use this as a tablet if you wanted.\n\nThe battery power is really excellent overall.  I am receiving almost 7 hours everytime with moderate typical use:  internet, MS Office and similar use.  I intend to place a SSD drive into this computer, which is apparently fairly easy to do and will surely accommodate even longer battery power. Plus, thee charging time for this computer i actually quite short - a very nice charge happens within 1.5 hours.  So, this computer will easily get through a typical workday with typical use (assuming lunchbreaks, and not constant use.\n\nOverall:  I am really beginning to love the computer  It is very well made and is better than I thought.  I think many of the criticisms of the computer is really based on the weakness of Windows 8.1.  This is a very nice computer.  Sure, it is not the Macbook, and I can't pretend to have spent 1 thousand dollars on this.  But at least everytime I see a Macbook, I can smugly remember that I spent 1/3 of the price and stilllive with myself.\n\nThis is a great little computer for a netbook, and you could do much much worse."}

Noticed a quirk when I first logged on to the internet. Card would go to sleep after a minute or so. I turned this feature off in the properties of the card and worked great ever since. Also it runs all the programs I needed tor work. and I work in a rough environment but it has been holding up better than I would have imagined for the price. This is not a gaming pc so don't expect a powerful gaming machine. but it handles office and plays online videos great."}

I have an ipad, but needed a full featured laptop for business.  Other 2in1's have 32 or 64gb of storage, or were prohibitively expensive for a part time use laptop which seemed like a big problem to me.  So when I found this one on sale it seemed to solve both problems.\n\nPros - Fits in an expandable folder, is very light, looks good, gets sufficient battery life for me to meet with clients all day, at coffee shops, their offices, homes for sale, etc... and when I get home at night it still has plenty of battery life left.\n\nCons - Windows 8.  I literally can't express how horrible windows 8 is compared to windows 7.  It does have it's good points, like touch screen friendliness, but has some absolutely horrible things like switching programs every time my finger brushes the touch pad from the left and is basically an incoherent mess.  I didn't deduct a star for that because that's a windows 8 problem not a problem specific to this laptop."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF3M", "review": "I hate this machine.  It started off great:  solid state HD to minimize heat/scratching issues, great screen, relatively fast.\n\nLoaded a few things (Firefox, some MS Office stuff) and the speed began to degrade terribly - lags on startup (despite being meticulous about the Startup Apps, Disk Cleanup, and Services), and opening programs.\n\nThen, more weirdness: if I even have the edge of my hand hover over the keypad, it will suddenly switch windows...\n\nTHE BIGGEST SIN on this damned thing is this:  the screen keeps blacking out!  I think it keeps thinking that I'm trying to fold it back into tablet mode, and whatever sensor is on just suddenly blacks out the screen, in ht middle of when I'm working!  So I have to restart, open and close the lid like a f***ing idiot, which looks great when I'm using it for a presentation or on the road.\n\nSo close to good, but now INFURIATING.  Mechanical issues abound - I would trade it in if I could get another manufacturer's model."}

It is not that sensitive with touch screen pens. Using your fingers works perfectly fine, but if you try to use a pen it has trouble detecting it on the screen so you can't really drag file too far before it let's go of it.\n\nIt might be the type of pen I bought, but I've tried about 3 different brands and none seem to work right for the screen, all of them worked perfectly in a similar laptop of another brand that my brother has though.\n\nIn all, it's a good laptop for the price and the battery lasts quite long so I can spend hours in the library without having to plug it in."}

The trackpad often does things I don't mean to or don't want to. My husband adjusted the truckpad's sensitibity but didn't help much.

I use a Windows at school (non-traditional student here), plus we have a couple older Windows laptops at home, a Linux box, and an old Dell box...so I figured it wouldn't be too big of a deal to just get another Windows.  However, I just so dislike the operating system of Windows 8. It's not as intuitive as prior Windows operating systems, so I cannot stand this computer.  It's too bad...it's not the computer's fault.  It didn't need to be filled with a criminally ridiculous operating system.  It's a cute size with an ok keyboard (but not nearly as good of a keyboard as our Mac book).  But the operating system is too slow.  And I'm going to need to get a book from the library (like a Windows 8 for complete idiots) to understand how to get this to work for me.  Since I don't use this computer much -- because I just can't stand it -- when I do use it I have to relearn weird things; swipe this way for that, swipe that way for this...no, no, use two fingers and swipe this way.  The GOOD news is my children really want a laptop (our other Windows laptops are literally falling apart with missing buttons), so I'll be giving up on this one and letting them play Minecraft on it.  I gave it a few months and now I realize I am defeated.  I Once I get out of school, I'll get a job and be able to buy a Mac book."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF3M", "review": "I'll try to kee this review as short as possible. But I'll keep it detailed too.\n\nAs a long time Dell hater, and for good reasons. I was looking for anything but a Dell. I needed a portable computer to throw in my small Osprey day pack that I take to work or wherever. I needed it to be powerful enough to run some programming applications and host an Oracle virtual machine for classes I'm taking. And it had to be cheap enough to not make me want to slash my wrists in sacrifice to the blood god in order to pay for it. In other words, Apple was out simply because of the above. As much as I want a MacBook mini, it just wasn't practical or cost effective for what I needed it for.\n\nThis computer was what I settled on after much research. I'll admit I was skeptical but man, it blew me away. It's not screaming fast by any means (it's not my 9lb 17.9\" MSI gaming notebook for sure) but it runs what I need it to, and quickly enough for me to be happy and never frustrated. The battery life is AMAZING. I don't exaggerate in the least with this, it lasts forever. And the power profiles keep it running very well on battery power with little to no loss of computing speed, which in experience is a rarity. Normally you have to sacrifice battery life greatly to get even close to plugged in power.\n\nI can't comment much on the tablet functionality, as I have only used it that way a few times for reading. The hinges are still as tight as the day I bought it though so I supposed they'll hold up to frequent tablet usage.\n\nThe body is solidly built and all aluminum. A+ for the price range too.\n\nI won't comment on Win8. It blows... If you have the ability, just downgrade to Win7 but if you can't, it'll take a bit of getting used to. I didn't feel like downgrading and mess with that so I figured out Win8.\n\nDell did a great job with this one. Hands down."}

Its looks very sleek and the color is just amazin.  It has a really high -end look to it. I love the amount of ports this device comes with and the sound is amazing for such a little machine. When I pulled it out of the box, it was actually smaller than I anticipated, but the size makes it very easy to carry around. I Walk with it to work everyday and it doesn't make my backpack heavy at all. The keyboard feels great to type on. I thought it may have taken some getting used too, but I was completely wrong. Because of the design of the keypad, being spaced out, it feels awesome to type on. I got used to it immediately. Its better to type on than a 14\" laptop I was using previously. The screen is great too. Touch gives me no problems, very responsive. I love the different modes as well. Of course it would be heavy in tablet mode, because its about 3lbs, but the display and tent modes are a good way to use the touch screen without having to deal with the weight in your hand. I've been looking at this laptop for months before I purchased it and I'm really glad I did. Everyone likes it and wants to get one like it. The one thing I wish it had was A  backlit keypad, but for the price I got it for ($339) I really can't complain. I think its the best thing out there on its price range if you want a 2 in 1 machine. I plan on upgrading the RAM as well, though it isn't giving me trouble as is. Overall I would HIGHLY recommended this laptop to ANYONE who wants a nice, everyday laptop to use on the go, or at home.

Let's start with price. .  Unless you find a great deal elsewhere this is it . price range for a convertible laptops are not cheap ..So all in all great for someone on a tight budget.. . Who will benefit the most from this device obviously I really can't answer but.. Currently I use mine as a total replacement for work and personal life . ..I  am in the insurance industry and I need to be connected all the time to produce quotes, email communications and produce info quickly for my customers .  I am also in school and currently use One Note, Office and of course the Internet for my course studies..  For my personal use I am able to browse at amazing speeds and download files quickly I was even able set Up XBMC /Kodi and Netflix to stream movies and shows. In addition to all of this I use this device for some graphic work Photo Shop CS 6 . haven't test video games yet but I believe the hardware will allow you to play and run a few games with out distress. NOW FOR THE BATTERY... 8 Hours just doing light work 6 if your connected or running multiple things.. Personally I suggest you turn off running certain programs in background to utilize the full potential.  On a full charge I was able to watch a full movie on Netflix 2 hours 30 Min  and browse the Web email.. Facebook. .ect..  Another 2.5 hours and then stream Pandora for another hour or so with bluetooth connectivity and still had about 1 hour left.. I'm telling you I only purchase devices that are useful to me.. And Battery life has to be up there. (Hence why I Still have my Asus tf101 running Katkiss this tablet can can run 13 plus hours...on one charge).... .Anyway what about the size? its about the size of a one subject notebook 11.6 inches so If you need a bigger screen then get a 15 inch. For me it's portable fits in my 15 inch laptop bag with room for a notebook or other stuff  .. I have no problems typing a small email or a 10 page research paper with ease. But again it's up to every individual.. Personally if this is a concern head up to Best Buy or a store where you can try it out... Now The resolution.. . and screen is crystal clear not a dead pixel or lack luster view.. Great for watching or reading and easy on the eyes now I did notice a glare on the screen when outdoors with direct sunlight but again  it's a regular screen. anti glare cost money..\nTouch screen very responsive and quick... I am in the process of finding a good stylus to work with this device so if anybody out there could recommend one it will be appreciated.. Ok Speakers.. Simply.. loud and clear..  This little thing can push. . great sound... no its not or going to be in away Beats Audio or Bose sound quality but again those options costs and there out there.. .. if you are not looking to Dj a banquet hall with your laptop speakers then I think you should be fine... Additionally the space, ports, listed and HDMI out is a huge plus... easy connect Blue tooth pairs up nicely to any BT devices.. Sorry . no Blu-ray, CD, disk drive/player . but you can pick up an external portable one for cheap. . All in all if your looking for something that is a good buy.. Can be used for everyday use, Great Battery life, portable and even looks good then I say I highly recommend this product.. .\nJust want to note a little more on the design.. Silver and. Sleek the hinges work well is not cheap! the only CON is disabling the keyboard when in tent position. However still not a deal breaker..\nAlso recommended*\n this device comes with few bloatware.. SORRY  No MS office software , McAfee Antivirus.. I noticed that the Antivirus that came with the device would slow my laptop down so .What I did was deleted the Maccafee and used AVG instead.. .it runs faster then ever now I am also in the works of upgrading the RAM.. Hope this helps . ..Good luck!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF3M", "review": "I love this Dell 11.6\" i3147. I'm really enjoying using it in my work. But I did my homework first to make sure to overcome what downsides it has. Frequent complaints are:\n\n* Freezing and slow OS (I switched to an extra 500GB SSD I had. I cloned it directly from the new HDD at the very start. Then on starting it up, I made sure to run it 3 times through Windows Update and wait until it *finished* all update installs before I began to use it.) Here is what I used to clone the HDD->SDD drive, though there are several free software solutions to help you do this:\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Sabrent-USB-3-0-to-SATA-Dual-Bay-External-Hard-Drive-Docking-Station-for-2-5-or-3-5in-HDD-SSD-with-Hard-Drive-Duplicator-Cloner-Function-4TB-Support-EC-HDD2/dp/B00IKC14OG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Sabrent USB 3.0 to SATA Dual Bay External Hard Drive Docking Station for 2.5 or 3.5in HDD, SSD with Hard Drive Duplicator/Cloner Function [4TB Support] (EC-HDD2)</a>\n\n* The wireless card frequently drops the signal. This is in part due to it being only a single band working on 2.5GHz like the bluetooth. (I looked up the size of wireless card in the unit which was the slim , taller one, and then ordered a new Intel 7260AC wireless card from Amazon for $38:\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/7260NGW-Intel-Dual-Band-Wireless-AC-7260-802-11ac-Dual-Band-2x2-Wi-Fi-Bluetooth-4-0/dp/B00GUNZUG0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">7260NGW Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC 7260 802.11ac, Dual Band, 2x2 Wi-Fi + Bluetooth 4.0</a>\nWhen the laptop arrived, I changed out the card at the same time I changed out the HDD. On bootup, Win 8.1 installed the new drivers and I then updated those drivers for the 7260AC wireless card. So far, I have no wireless issues. It works extremely fast on my company's AC router: 150-250Mbps. Funnily, I think I get a bit better throughput by letting Win 8.1 install it's default drivers for the card and BT rather than Intel's updated ones. No idea why, but the default ones seem more stable.)\n\nNOTE: I'm finding that Dell's suggested Realtek HD Audioo drivers seem to conflict with the Intel 7260 wireless card's drivers. The best has been to utterly remove/delete BOTH sets of drivers and then reboot and let Win 8.1 install its default drivers for the Intel network card and the audio. DON'T upgrade either of them. Then both seem to work great & smoothly & fast.\n\n* Many complained that the chassis felt thin and too flexible, with the area around the palm rest flexing and causing touchpad issues. Reviews also complained of the cheap paint job on the unit and frequent scratches on top and bottom of the unit. (Examining it, I found that the paint *is* pretty thin and cheap feeling. So when I ordered the 3147, I also ordered the iPearl mCover hardshell case for the Dell 3147 for $19:\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/iPearl-mCover-Hard-Shell-Case-for-11-6-34-Dell-Inspiron-11-3147-3148-2-in-1-Convertible-Laptop-Black/dp/B00ONKJ2N4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">iPearl mCover Hard Shell Case for 11.6\" Dell Inspiron 11 3147 / 3148 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop (Black)</a>\nAs soon as the laptop arrived, I put the shell on the top to minimize scratching while I worked on the inner components, and once I was done with removing the bottom, I put the bottom shell on as well. The shell does prevent the laptop from folding back into full tablet mode, but I already have a tablet, so I don't need that feature. I can still do 3 of the 4 positions: laptop, tent & display. Also, that thin bit of extra shell casing makes the laptop much more rigid. I get no touchpad errors at all and the palm rest has no noticeable flex to me. So that makes two clear benefits for having this hard case on it, though it does add 8 oz to the weight.\n\nThen to keep down scratching on the exposed surfaces, with the bottom iPearl mCover shell off, I used some Carnauba car wax that I had for vintage pen restoration and applied several coats on the surface where my hands rest as an extra layer of protection. I put the wax over the entire area except the actual keyboard, of course, and buffed it to a slight shine. It works well and the paint feels much more solid now. When I have the time, I will do the same on the lid and bottom of the laptop. Sounds weird, but many do it for vintage pens as I did and this works well and is fairly harmless and never yellows.)\n\n* Some complained that the bottom of the case was fragile/breakable when removing the bottom plate. So I purchased the laptop nylon spudger tool kit for $12.50:\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Set-of-5-Professional-Laptop-LCD-iPad-iPod-Spudgers-Non-Mar-Nylon-and-Metal-Pry-Open-Repair-Tools-for-Plastic-Cell-Phone-Tablet-and-MP3-Cases/dp/B00A8Q9U34/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Set of 5 Professional Laptop, LCD, iPad, iPod Spudgers Non-Mar Nylon and Metal Pry Open Repair Tools for Plastic Cell Phone, Tablet and MP3 Cases</a>\nThen I opened the bottom carefully, avoiding any pressure near any of the port areas. And the nylon spatula sticks made no scars on my laptop bottom cover.\n\nI decided I would wait on the RAM upgrade until I determined how much memory Win 8.1 would use under my usage. Dell's specs on the RAM are incorrect. The processor handles up to 8GB and many have upgraded it easily. But, IMO, the most noticeable upgrade will be switching out the HDD for an equal-sized SSD. That makes a real difference. The increase in RAM will only show up if you do a lot of multitasking and have 20+ tabs open in two web browsers at the same time. Mostly, the upgrade from 4GB to 8GB will not be very seeable to most users. Those more power-hungry users won't (or shouldn't) be buying this cheaper laptop. It is great, but it is no powerhouse, and it isn't meant to be.\n\n* As an added note, several complained of huge amounts of bloatware/trialware/adware. To my surprise, beyond a trial version of Office 365 that comes with nearly all Win 8.1 installations, I found NO bloatware at all. Even the dreaded and hard-to-remove McAfee AV was NOT THERE. This, BTW, was a new boxed unit from Dell via Amazon. Still had the box & inner stickers sealing it from Dell. There were some Dell utilities for updating Dell drivers but after running it once and having Dell put in a driver that made an issue (wireless card), I just uninstalled it. So it is to me 99% adware-free. I think Windows Add-Remove Program list was perhaps 10 items. Very short and easy. I can't speak for others, but my 3147 arrived Feb 19th with pretty much NO BLOATWARE or adware. Yay!\n\nFor those worrying that opening the back voids the Dell warranty, rest at ease. The Dell Users Guide that comes with it is ONLY about how to open it to access all inner components. IOW, Dell *expects* you to open it and upgrade parts yourself! No warranty voided. Though if you damage the body while doing so, *that* is on your head. Nearly no other 2-in-1 laptops offer this kind of accessibility, so that was and is a real selling point for me.\n\n* The ONLY CON I'd give it now is the old-style adapter plug. It juts out of the left side of the unit a good inch just waiting for an accident to break it off and damage the charging port. I'd have much preferred a right-angle plug to this. Perhaps later I can get such an extra adapter on Amazon. One day, maybe Windows units will come with magnetic charger plugs as we have on the Macs. One day ....\n\n* Another con is that with the lid open in work mode, the laptop is a bit unbalanced. Depending on the angle of the screen, the front rubber pads may actually float a tiny bit off of the desk top allowing it to move around. To overcome this, I put my 8.9\" Fire tablet in its rubberized case under the back side of the 3147 by just a 1/4\" or so. This raises the back end by about 1/4\" and is just enough to keep the weight to the front and prevent it from moving and keeps it stable. Works for me. Others may hate this idea. I just want to get work done.\n\n* Oh, and one last con. Several have complained about the touchpad. Many hate it. To overcome any glitches, I TURNED OFF all gestures on my touchpad. It can see one & two-fingered taps but no gestures. I also turned off scrolling, etc areas on the touch surface. I just wanted a mouse pad. And this works for me. Some insist on the gestures and zooming, etc features. I'd rather have that off than suffer weird mouse behavior. And now my touchpad works wonderfully; no glitches or wait-states at all. It does just what I want it to do.\n\nOver all, this laptop flies for me; no slow downs, no freezes, no video buffering, no mouse touchpad weird behavior. The laptop body with the added hardshell case is firm and solid. Every OS operation is smooth and opening apps is also fast. All components are easily accessible (9 screws and if you have the right nylon spatula tool & patience, no damage to the housing). Many of the extra tools and USB 3 Cloner I bought, I'll use later for other devices, so no loss there either.\n\nFor me, factoring in its price, processor and accessibility, I give this laptop a solid 5 stars."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF3M", "review": "I received my Dell 2 in 1 about two weeks ago and have been amazed by what this laptop/tablet can do. I, like others before me, have upgraded the RAM from 4gb to 8gb, and am in the process of upgrading the standard hard drive to a solid state drive for quicker responses when opening multiple applications (I use this laptop mainly for instructing PowerPoint workshops where I play large video files and multiple graphics). This laptop is a much needed upgrade from my previous netbook, which ran XP with a puny 1.33 Atom processor. The Pentium processor (2.16) is a nice step up. While not an I-core, this processor is a quad-core speed, which makes most daily applications in laptop or tablet mode run pretty smoothly. Video playback is smooth with reasonable picture quality; again, a vast improvement from my dated netbook. Graphics are sharp and clean from its max 1366x768 resolution screen. I have read many comments about this 2 in 1 from Amazon as well as on C-Net and other websites. The vast majority of reviews have been positive. This laptop is relatively thin (1\" thick) and light (3.1lbs) for an 11.6\". Battery life is fairly reasonable with up to 7-hours of use on a single charge. For the money and versatility of this Dell 2 in 1 for everyday use, I highly recommend it!"}

Going into college required more usage of microsoft office and I hated switching from google docs to office constantly. So I decided to buy into windows and give it a go. For the price, it's an excellent computer. 4gb of ram is plenty for an average user, it'll load word, music, and still be able to be on the internet just fine. However I would highly suggest upgrading the HDD to an SDD. I bought a 128gb sdd with this and put it in as soon as possible. On the first boot, it took awhile load, probably two minutes or so. Afterwards it took probably a bit longer than 1 minute before everything was functional. After putting in the sdd, it loads much much faster and there is hardly any wait time. I've always seen touchscreens as annoyances, why would anyone want to poke at the precious screen? However the touchscreen is actually handy for when I am simply too lazy to scroll and click with the trackpad. In my opinion the tablet portion is useless. It's much too large and awkward, however there are no issues with it. One of the biggest issues i have with well this 2 in 1 is the flexible keys. For those who do not know what I'm talking about, when you press on the keyboard it dips down just a bit. It flexes as you type. Same with the trackpad. I am unsure if there is a fix for this, however it's in my opinion mildly annoying. but tolerable, for the amount of power you get out of this laptop it's very much so worth the flexible keyboard. I noticed a few other reviews having issues regarding the condition of the item when it arrives, (i.e it was marked as \"new\" on amazon but was actually refurbished), to this, you must simply just pay close attention to the seller of the item. It looks more expensive than it is and it functions very well. I use my laptop for commute and for college. To anyone who wishes to edit videos, videos, play more advanced games, don't buy this. For those who need to get work done, at home, in the car, in a train, on a plane, this is the laptop for you."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF3M", "review": "I purchased this laptop convertible in December 2014.  I liked the slim looks and tablet hinged, touch screen capability.  When I first received it, I noticed it did not sit evenly on my glass desk.  It would rock a little when I placed my palms on the palm rest.  Then I noticed that the keyboard had a lot of flex in it.  Shortly thereafter, I noticed when my room darkened in the evening, the screen would dim and I could not bring it back to full brightness.  I call Dell support and they told me the ambient light sensor could be bad and return it to Dell in Texas because the display might need to be replaced.  Things went down hill from there.  I waited about two weeks for my Dell Inspiron to be returned and it was returned NO TROUBLE FOUND.  I then spent hours on the telephone with support (Support is in India I believe.)  I refused to send it back to Texas and they sent out a tech on 3 different occasions.  Replaced motherboard, keyboard and display.  When they did not have a replacement display in stock, they offered to send me a REFURBISHED LAPTOP of the same model.  That did not sound like a good deal to me, I purchase a new laptop and pay new prices and Dell sends me back a refurbished one!  All of this confusion and hours on the telephone, Dell literally destroyed the laptop replacing parts and changing drivers and settings and I discovered the fix myself.  You have to disable the ambient light sensor in your power settings.  But by the time I discovered the fix, Dell had trashed the laptop.  The keyboard and touch screen worked intermittently.\n\nThank God for Amazon.  They sent me a replacement same day.  It worked OK, but it turned out the touch pad was not seated properly and was higher than the palm rest.  POOR QUALITY CONTROL!  Another example of poor quality, one of the techs that worked on replacing my display, told me the cable from the motherboard to the display was so short, it kept pulling loose when he tried to replace displays.\n\nAmazon sent me a total of 3 units and I finally got a good one and I LOVE IT!  I would have liked to give it 5 STARS, but because of Dell's disappointing support and the poor quality control, I cannot!\n\nAMAZON SUPPORT - definitely 5 STARS!  Laptop I now have 5 STARS!\n\nMy advice is it is a great product at a great price!  If you get a lemon, don't go to Dell.  Go back to AMAZON.  They take care of their customers!"}

It is truly a laptop- battery life is variable depending on how you use it.  One moment it might tell you that you only have 3.5 hours left, the next minute you have 4.6 hours left.  In tablet mode it's heavy and bulky, so not very good for holding for reading books.  Windows apps are sparse and not very good.  Shopping for programs to buy on the internet gives you a more fruitful response but lacks the security of buying from an \"approved\" source in the app store with reviews to help guide your decision.

It features Windows 8.1, a 2.1GHz Pentium Quad Core CPU, Intel HD Graphics, 4GB of RAM, 500GB HDD, 11.6\" 1366 by 768 resolution. It also has a full HDMI port, 1 USB 3.0, 2 USB 2.0, Full size SD card reader (SD cards DON'T stick out when inserted--major plus!), Accelerometer, 2.0MP Webcam, Ambient Light Sensor.\n\n*SIDE NOTE: I am upgrading from Averatec N3400 series laptop that I got March 2010, which still works great, and handles most things I throw at it. It featured Windows 7 Home Premium, a Core2Duo 2.1GHz CPU, Intel HD4400 Graphics, 4GB RAM, 320GB HDD, 13.3\" 1200 by 800 resolution, 1.3MP Webcam, VGA port. I have that as my backup PC now.\n\nUPGRADES:The 500GB is spacious for the majority of us, but the option is there for those wanting to upgrade to a SSD (up to SATA II speeds). The 4GB of RAM is also upgradeable to 8GB.\n\nLIKE: Tablet Mode! You can flip the screen over to the back and it acts like a Windows 8.1 tablet! There are many positions this laptop can be propped up in. Right now, I like using it in 'tent mode' (think triangle with point on top).\n\nA responsive 10-finger input touchscreen is also present. Makes using the device more practical than a mouse or using the touchpad (I hate using laptop touchpads).\n\nThe battery life I've been able to get is between 8-9 hours! 40% brightness, BT on, Wifi on.\n\nDISLIKE: None!\n\nI have no dislikes about this laptop. It's not a gaming laptop, nor is it the fastest processor out there. The pricing on Amazon and Dell show this as more of a budget/value model. It works with HD videos and for my lifestyle so that's all that matters to me!\n\nGet this laptop! You won't be disappointed."}

Then, while I was using it, I heard a \"click\" and the sound of the disk spinning down. Many, many attempts to reboot were futile. Sometimes, on rebooting, I would see the white circle logo on the screen for a second or two, then \"click\" and dark screen again. But mostly the reboots were completely unresponsive. I called Dell and they said it would have to go back for repairs, but they said I would first have to request a \"transfer of ownership\" from the previous owner. I was surprised and went back to verify that it was indeed advertised as \"brand new\". Apparently it was a \"refurbished\" machine, but advertised as \"brand new\".\n\nFurther aggravating the matter was that I had already set up some personal accounts on the computer, and now had no way to access the OS to delete them.\n\nSo that soured the whole deal for me.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF3M", "review": "Out of the box, the Inspiron 11, 3000 Series is reasonably impressive in terms of bang-for-buck ratio. Impressive (almost over the top) 500GB storage capacity, great display and an eye-friendly form factor. The weight is good as well. Combine this rig with a few mods, and you get beyond your money's worth.\n\nIn my experience, I've achieved the most utility out of any computer by narrowing down to two bottlenecks: network and CPU. This laptop hits the reverse of that out of the box, RAM and HDD. Upgrading these turns this into an impressive little laptop.\n\nThe first thing I did was upgrade the RAM. Indeed, Dell claims this unit can only accommodate 4GB, which is false. I am happily running an 8GB low-voltage DIMM with zero issues. I replaced the 4GB chip before even turning on the unit. Easy-peasy.\n\nSecond, I upgraded the 500GB HDD to a 250GB SSD. This took some work. You have two options: clone the existing HDD or install Windows 8.1 fresh. I really didn't want to track down my license key, nor did I want to go on the infamous \"driver hunt\" that seems to crop up with these newer touch-screen netbooks. Cloning was the way to go for me. If you're looking for a quick fix, buy an SSD of the same size (an extra $100) along with a drive cloner ($40) and press a single button - you're done. I did it the hard way, with a smaller drive...\n\nHere's the general process I used:\n\n- First, modify the BIOS by hitting F2 at startup.\n- In the Boot menu, disable \"Secure Boot\", enable \"Load Legacy Option Rom\" and ensure Boot List Option is set to \"UEFI.\"\n- Save and exit.\n- Pull out the HDD and manually SATA it into another computer/workstation (or use an enclosure/USB adapter).\n- Do the same with the SSD.\n- Boot up the workstation, go into Disk Management in your workstation and find the two drives.\n- Note that there are 4 partitions on the HDD; we want to copy all of them.\n- Shrink the \"OS\" partition (right-click) so that all 4 partitions will fit on your new drive. I left 10% extra for the performance consistency argument.\n- Next, I used Macrium Reflect (the free version) to clone the HDD to the SSD. I tried EaseUS Todo Backup Free, Windows Restore, and Windows Image Creator, none of which worked. I've heard Acronis fails to do the job as well.\n- In Macrium, you will see the following partitions:\n\n[Little Partition][Recovery Partition][OS (big partition)][Unallocated space (also big)][Recovery Partition]\n\nIf you try to copy everything to your smaller SSD, you will likely get a \"not enough space\" error - I believe it's trying to put the unallocated space in between the two partitions above. Instead, I've had no problem dragging every partition one-by-one so they copy over like this:\n\n[Little Partition][Recovery Partition][OS][Recovery Partition][Unallocated space]\n\n- After cloning, pop the SSD into your laptop and boot on up!\n\nI ended up factory restoring right before cloning, and it booted up as if it had just been pulled out of box (setup screen and everything). I'd recommend cloning before even turning the on for the first time. Naturally, there are some SSD optimizations you can perform after this, but this'll get you up and running.\n\nA few notes:\n\n- Opening the case is tricky. There are 9 screws on the bottom and the casing is snapped in and magnetized as well. I wasn't able to get in without the assistance of a flat head screw driver, and ended up causing little scuffs around the edges along the bottom. These are not noticeable unless you're looking for them. Also be *extra* careful if you lever anywhere around a USB or SD slot; these will snap in half very easily, I found to my dismay.\n\n- Once you get up and running, you may notice decreased performance immediately after your first boot, persisting for an hour or so - I believe this is the operating system's search indexing everything. This smooths out after a little while.\n\n- You may notice the unit gets hot if you run in tablet mode. Note where the exhaust port is - it's very easy to cover and not realize it.\n\n- The island keys feel fine, but the surrounding bezel appears bowed up and flexes when typing. Just makes the unit feel a little cheap sometimes.\n\nOver all, I'm extremely happy with this laptop/netbook mod - it went from good to awesome for a grand total of about $510. It's very zippy and has been able to handle anything I throw at it (general internet usage, documenting, and remote controlling of a larger desktop). The touchscreen is a little meh sometimes, but what do you expect in a $300 machine? The screen real estate and brightness continue to impress me, and the battery life is spectacular now - It was good before, but now I'm getting 8-10 hours with reasonably heavy usage on the stock battery (I may replace this as well in future, but so far I've had no complaints).\n\nHave fun!"}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF3M", "review": "Shortly - about a month - after we purchased this item, when folding it back from tablet to laptop mode, one of the hinges popped loose and broke, causing the touch screen to stop working.\n\nWe contacted Dell, who told us that despite this being a new purchase, they counted that as \"normal wear and tear.\" I kept calling back, because Dell is supposed to warranty the hardware, and if a hinge and touchscreen isn't hardware (which at one point they tried to indicate) I don't know what is.  After several days of repeated chat sessions, phone calls, and \"escalating,\" after I mentioned that I would be posting this complaint - they FINALLY agreed to send a technician, who found that in fact, the plastic housing on the hinge had broken when it should not have, and rendered the touch controls on the screen (which are inside the hinge) inoperable.  He replaced the touch screen and fixed it. Basically, Dell's position about hardware on this machine is that customers who call for service treated the computer roughly and are lying about it: I was extremely surprised by this treatment, which is an antique way to handle problems.\n\nThat said, first of all, be aware that the hinges are not separate pieces but are fixed to the bottom of the laptop with relatively flimsy plastic - this computer is cheap because it is made cheaply, both in design and materials.  We also own a Lenovo Yoga that has the same hinge mechanism - but is much more durable and probably easier to fix because the hinges are a separate piece of metal.\n\nOtherwise, this computer has mostly been worth the money - but be forewarned that it needs to be handled very, very delicately and that Dell will basically refuse to help you unless you threaten to publicly tell the truth about how difficult it is to get warranty service. (Note: we did not have the same problems with the slightly more expensive Inspiron 13 7000 series that we also bought; I wish we had bought two of those even though the 11 inch size is more convenient for me.)"}

It only takes two hours to fully charge. It might take less than that, but the power light doesn't indicate a full charge, so I let it go about two hours and then when I turn it on it has full charge.\nSometimes the mousepad opens up the \"Charms\" when I'm moving the cursor, but I'm sure that can be turned off, and you could always buy a cheap USB mouse if it really bothers you.\nTouchscreen works well, I am primarily using it in laptop mode (as opposed to tablet) for school. If you are going to use IE in tablet mode, I would use the Start screen app rather than the desktop link. The desktop version doesn't cooperate very well with the touch screen.\nIt is configured to hibernate after 3 hours of inactivity, and it won't wake up from hibernate if you just open the lid.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF3M", "review": "I bought this laptop for its portability and possible use as a tablet for art and design. Let me just say the form factor is perfect, it's got a big enough screen for easy viewing and is still small enough for comfortable carry in hand. It's thin and light and features the ports I need for optional accessories on-the-go (external storage and a mouse, the hdmi is definitely a plus). It runs a full Windows OS and runs an Intel processor so you know it'll run all the aps and programs you'll need. For the price it's a GREAT deal and with a few upgrades actually becomes a SERIOUS road warrior.\n\nOut-of-the-box it can handle most tasks just fine, I spent a couple days on it with just the 4GB of memory and the 500GB hdd while waiting for my upgrades. The first time you crack it open will be a NIGHTMARE of updates though, exposing the real down-side of being equipped with a mechanical 5400rpm hdd. Initially apps took forever to load and McAfee was making matters worse with its background scanning AND Windows updating. I work with computers anyway so I always expect this hurdle but it's just a tad more unbearable when going through it on lower spec'd machines. Once you get those outta the way the laptop will be in a more workable state, though checking the task manager did reveal constant hdd access and being at 100% usage most of the time. The memory situation isn't bad too, it stayed around 30-45% of the installed 4GB most of the time but I decided to upgrade it to be able to load larger programs easier (especially for working in art and photoshop programs).\n\nThe one SINGLE upgrade that did the MOST for this laptop was the ssd, I picked up a cheap Adata 128GB and WITH MUCH TROUBLE managed to clone the old one and take it out for storage as an external hdd in an enclosure. Be careful with cloning as you have to make sure Dell's recovery and other partitions still work otherwise you'll need external means of recovery. Best advise given what I know now is to create a recovery usb flash drive from Dell's own Data Protection app while you're still on the old drive then use that to recover on the ssd.\n\n***Please do your research ahead of time and get everything you need before you give up that old drive!***\n\nAnyway, this thing is just awesome now and I say get one while you can, definitely a great buy. I took away a star for the hdd and the resulting laggy out-of-the-box experience while it got chores done, though the price obviously dictated that.\n\nUPDATE 3/8/15\n\nI actually had to send back my original unit for some issues and instead purchased another unit directly from Dell. Due to a promo going on I ended up getting the 3148 version which has a Core i3 processor in it. A MAJOR difference from the quad core Pentium which unfortunately had a pretty anemic iGPU but was also half the TDP (7.5w versus 15w). In the end to me the Core i3 was the better deal as I could actually do some gaming on it (several games I've tried got mixed results but with tweaking most played well at full panel resolution). Also in general the Core i3 offered better overall system performance (2 stronger cores with hyper threading versus 4 weaker but higher clocked cores).\n\nI have majorly enjoyed the experience on this laptop and the battery life now with the SSD installed has netted me between 8-9 hours max with light use and default power settings. One quick note, Dell is shipping these now with better hard drives (mine came with a WD 5400 rpm that got around 120 megs per second). The resulting OOBE was MUCH better, so much so that I actually thought maybe the SSD wouldn't be necessary now though obviously it was still a major plus all around. Overall I absolutely L O V E the 2in1 concept and now cannot live another way :) Dell has also been exceptional in their customer service. That together with all of the above has forced me to give it 5 stars."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF3M", "review": "Bought this for my wife who wants a laptop but not a tablet. So I got her both and she loves it. The laptop is great for both laptop and tablet use. It is a little heavy to carry around as a tablet and very light for a laptop. It fits in that sweet zone. It is awesome to use on the couch or in bed watching movies and just surfing the web. Fold the screen back and off you go. This beats a laptop as you do not have they keyboard to deal with. The Presentation Mode is the best for when you are laying on the couch or in an odd position as the keyboard makes for a great base on any odd angle.  It is great for getting on line, watching videos, Office, and other stuff that a casual person will do, and exactly what my wife uses it for. I have my custom desktop that we use for editing videos, Photoshop, etc. Overall the Pentium is a great laptop for the money and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a convertible.\n\nCons that I noticed.\n1) The corners are not very rounded and will dig into the palm of your hand. Have to hold it on the sides or bottom when using it as a tablet.\n2) The heat vent is at the back center. I can see why they put it there but its not a good spot. If you have it in tablet mode resting on your chest, you will be blocking the vents as they point down. Or is you are typing with it on your lap, odds are you are holding the laptop at an angle pointing the back of the laptop down into your legs blocking the vents. If using it in tablet mode while laying down, I suggest you turn it upside down, so the windows button is at the top. This points the vents up and keeps it cool. This is nitpicking as i was holding it like this for a while and the bottom got just a little hot but where else is the heat gong to go if you block the vents?\n3) There is some flex to the central buttons on the keyboard, but nothing bad at all. Just something I noticed. Also if you press the windows button at the bottom center of the screen there is a little flex. But you really shouldnt be pushing it when in laptop mode so it doesnt matter.\n4) Comes with McAfee, but not much other bloat ware. I downloaded IObits uninstaller and Driver Updater and got rid of it. I recommend IObits uninstaller as it gets rid of EVERYTHING and does a registry clean to make sure it is gone and the Driver Updater gets everything up to the newest drivers.\n5) It took A LONG time to update (1.5gb download). Updates are normal and expected, but this one took almost all night. Granted I probably had OneDrive syncing her millions of pictures of our dogs, but it still took a while.\n6) You can hear the hard drive clicking when in use. The case is thin and the fan is so quiet that the loudest part is the hard drive. Scares my wife but its supposed to sound like that. There isn't anything to muffle the sound as in larger laptops, so I told her to turn up the volume a bit. Problem solved.\n7)  It comes with a SD card slot, not a micro sd slot. This is just personal preference as I will generally be using MicroSD cards over regular SD cards as my Surface 2 and cell phones have microSD cards. Just need to buy an adapter to slide the card into and then into the laptop. Thats all.\n\nOther than that, its a great laptop. The next thing I am going to do is replace the hard drive with a solid state drive to get rid of that faint clicking (mainly to appease my wife), to speed it up quite a bit, and increase battery life. Seriously, a Solid State Hard Drive is the single BEST upgrade you can do to a laptop, hands down."}

In the process of cloning my HD onto my SSD and running this laptop with SSD, but that will have to wait, because I still need to get the program.\nAlso, like most of the other people who bought this have already said, the mouse pad on this laptop sucks.

The touchscreen stopped working in the first month and prior to that it was sporadic and would stop working in the middle of use.  I got the touchscreen working again and now in month 3 it has completely stopped working.  I bought this computer for the touchscreen and tablet like qualities while still having the ability to use a laptop once in a while.  Now I have a mediocre laptop and no tablet like qualities.  It fails to recognize the power cord at random and freezes for 1-5 minutes at random or shuts down the program I am trying to use (programs that came installed on the machine!)  Try to use the mouse and the screen size enlarges to massive proportions and takes time to get back to a normal view.  If I were Mr. Magoo that would be a great feature but I am definitely not blind!  If I still had the box when this all started in the first month I would have returned it ASAP.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF3M", "review": "I'm very pleased with this machine.  Performance with the HDD wasn't bad, but I purposely refrained from loading up many apps that run in the background all the time.  Despite feeling the HDD performance was very reasonable, I switched out the HDD for a Crucial SSD, mostly because I wanted to try having a full SDD setup.  My i7 Lenovo has a small SSD to go with a large HDD, plus 8 gigs of RAM, so that is my normal work horse machine.  This little Dell, however, is a lot more fun than the i7 Lenovo.  Performance after replacing the HDD with the SSD is quicker, full startup is under ten seconds and awakening from sleep is almost simultaneous.  Battery life is good, much better than my Lenovo.  The touch screen has worked as expected, and the minor keyboard flex doesn't bother me.\n\nI'll point out that the Crucial SSD installation had some issues.  The cloning software that comes with the SSD appeared to work fine, but the machine would regularly freeze up after the switch.  After some research, it appears that a lot of folks have had that issue with the MX 100 Crucial SSD.  I had to do several tweaks and a BIOS update to get rid of the freezing up, but after a few hours of research and tweaking things, it has worked perfectly for several days now.  I'm also considering a RAM upgrade, but I'm going to watch memory usage with the Task Manager for a while and see if it appears I'd benefit from upgrading to 8 gigs.  If I experience any system slow downs from only having 4 gigs of RAM, then I'll upgrade.\n\nThe USB 3.0 works well with my Plugable USB 3.0 Docking Station UD3900 for extending or projecting the screen to my larger desk monitor.  No issues at all with screen resolution on the external monitor using the Plugable Docking Station, so I've not tried using the HDMI to run an external monitor.\n\nFor those of you with less than perfect eyesight, like me, take a close look at the primary functions of the top row of keys on the keyboard.  In addition to the usual volume and bright controls, there are several Windows 8.1 shortcuts that are very helpful when using a second screen.\n\nSo far, this seems like an excellent little budget machine.\n\nUpdate:  My company recently updated my work laptop to a new Thinkpad Yoga with 8 gigs of ram, a Core i7 processor and a 256 GB SSD.  While the keyboard, trackpoint and touchpad are all nicer on the Thinkpad, the little Dell holds its own just fine for my uses at home.  It actually starts up and shuts down more quickly than the Thinkpad, probably due to the enterprise security software that is on my work laptop while the little Dell is running Avast.  The Dell also picks up my home WIFI connection much more quickly than the Thinkpad.  The build feels much more solid on the Thinkpad, but the Dell seems like a very good little machine for less than half the cost of the Thinkpad.  If I liked the Dell's touchpad better, I'd probably take it on my work trips rather than the Thinkpad."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF3M", "review": "I've had mine for 3 weeks now and so far I'm happy with couple of features I didn't get from Asus.  I had Asus 11'6 touch screen and liked it as well but didn't care for the battery life which only lasted 2 hours or so after fully charged this even though it says 4 hours in the spec.  So with the short time I had with this laptop I will break down in pros and cons below.  I may update in the future as I use this little more.\n\nPros:\n1. Very nice speaker sound. Loud and almost sounds like a miniature stereo. Asus didn't have this quality.\n2. Battery life is much longer than Asus so far can't say how much ore but definitely longer.\n3. Has the option of flipping the screen all the way back so you have a tablet when you don't want the keyboard in front of you.\n\nCons:\n1. One of the most annoying thing about this and my Asus is the touch pad in which it's just a flat surface without any indentations from left to right, meaning if you press the right side then you get the \"A\" function which is where you use as enter and the right side as the \"B\" function where you get a drop down menu to select actions such as new folder and etc. Now the problem is that occassionally I press the left side to but it keeps giving me the \"B\" functions??!! Really really annoying when you're typing away and want to get a cursor there at certain area but it gives me the drop down menu instead.  I really wish they had separated these features instead of making one flat touch pad.\n2. Screen seems to be have a darker hue than the Asus.\n3. Heavier than Asus but definitely has the better quality feel to it than Asus.\n4. The charging cord is heavier with 3 prongs and has that rectangular shape bulk where you need to plug in as an extension before plugging in to an electrical outlet. Asus is just a cord with regular 2 prongs very easy to carry around and doesn't add weight to your laptop case.\n\nOtherwise, I am happy so far so I will keep using it."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF3M", "review": "Having the ability to have all the power you need to do any sort of tasks is an amazing feet and Dell damn near hits the mark on this one.  It just doesn't get much better than being able to watch a movie on a TV with the HDMI, hook up your laptop to a monitor and have two screens to be able to perform real work, use as a regular laptop for quick modifications to documents, writing e-mails, etc, and the ability to have a tablet to read news or play games (like Hearthstone).  I did do what most people will suggest on these reviews and dropped in the SSD and removed that slow 5400 rpm disk drive - I highly suggest it and you won't regret it even if you buy a small one for cheap.  I haven't done it yet, but you can also remove the current 4 GB of memory and put in an 8 GB stick.  Having the ability to have a cheap laptop that is upgradeable with good performance is awesome because that means it's future proof as long as you just pay a little more to keep it relevant.\n\nWith that said here is why I gave it 4/5 stars instead of 5/5 stars:  Dell makes this thing a nightmare to open, seriously a nightmare, The screws are so small (as is any computer) but they put some type of adhesive into the screw holes when putting in the screws and with such small screws it's so damn hard to get them out.  I stripped one of the screws that luckily was not imperative to replacing the HDD, but when it was all said an done I had blisters on my thumbs from fighting with those screws.  Secondly, the addition of the 500 GB 5400 RPM drive.  This is 2014/2015 we seriously need to get away from using disk drives and I believe laptops and computers by manufacturers like Dell charge way too much premium for a SSD.  I would have preferred to see a 128 or 64 GB SSD in this over a HDD.\n\nImpressive performance I would say for this machine.  And I almost want to give it 5 out of 5 stars, but I believe Intel could take the Atom series processors to the next level by putting a core series graphics accelerator on the mother board for these.  Keep in mind adding that will lower battery life, but it would put this laptop (and other devices using Bay Trail) into serious contention for being your all in 1 desktop/laptop/tablet replacement.  This issue really does not have much bearing on the review of this product since Dell isn't creating the architecture, they're just putting the pieces together but I had to mention it - especially in terms of playing games.\n\nSpeaking of games, I wanted to touch on that before ending this review.  Regardless that this is not a gamer's machine, there are a lot of people who want something that can perform their work but still have the ability to play some games on at their leisure plus, in most cases, gaming is a true benchmark of what a machine can handle.  I can confirm that this laptop does in fact run better than the 8\" and 10\" Bay Trail equivalents because this laptop actually sports a heatsink and fan (very quiet as well).  Why does this help?  Mainly because this allows the Bay Trail processor to run at a higher frequency because of the cooldown mechanisms used in this build (where as the other Bay Trail tablets only rock a heat sink) and I have not suffered from throttling on this laptop (where as on my Dell Venue 8 Pro I have).  This thing will run your classic favorites amazingly: Unreal Tournament 2004 ran flawlessly with excellent FPS, Counter Strike Source ran extremely well too with medium settings averaging 50 FPS, Diablo 3 was playable at the very lowest settings possible (800x600 with all settings on low and shadows off), Hearthstone is a breeze and is very fun on a tablet setting.  A lot of modern games are going to be difficult for this machine to run, but the key is the dynamic shadows that really hurt performance; if you're able to get rid of the dynamic shadows by changing the config files or the in game config then you will have a lot of games playable on this machine.\n\nIf you're looking for an ultra-portable with all the bells and whistles minus the price this is it, you found it.  If you're able to get this 2 in 1 at below 300 I highly suggest buying it and I know you won't be disappointed either."}

Being a MacBook person for years, thought I would try this Dell to replace a Lenovo Yoga that was painfully slow and kept crashing to run some of my Windows programs. First of all here is what I did after receiving the new Dell and what a difference with great results. Before turning on the device, I removed the mechanical HD and I purchased a Samsung EVO 850 SSD with 500 GB and a Crucial 8gb Ram stick. Placed the original drive and the new SSD drive in a cloneing adapter (available on Amazon for around $40). Pressed clone button and after approx. 45 minutes, the original drive was perfectly cloned on the new SSD drive,\nReplaced with the new SSD and 8 gb ram card. Fired up the Dell and it started fine as new with absolutely no issues. The Ultrabook is FAST and the boot speed is 3.7 seconds. Everything runs so much faster, loads faster and has become a much more appealing computer. The nice things about these upgrades, is that you can remove the items once the device has ran it's life course.\nReason for the 4 stars. The keyboard has some flex to it which is a little annoying and the bottom is plastic. Other than that I love it and would recommend the upgrades if you want a fast and reliable computer.\nSomeone has mentioed that the RAM was soldered on and the Crucial scan is incorrect as reporting that 4Gb is the maximum RAM allowed. That is incorrect, for I have removed the original 4GB ram card and replaced it with a Crucial 8GB card with no issues. Hope this review helps with your decision."}

The keyboard developed the famous \"far-left keys stopped working\" problem. This is a known issue at Dell. It's all over the web and on Dell's own forums about the problem.\n\nMy warranty expired just a little over a month ago, and Dell will not replace the keyboard. They said it will cost $159 to replace the keyboard. And that's on top of the cost of shipping it to them. So now you're talking close to $200 for a $30 replacement part. They won't sell just the keyboard to replace it myself.\n\nOthers have already stated that they have had the keyboard replaced by Dell, only to have the problem return again.\n\nOn top of that, Windows 10 keeps locking the device up if it sits without being used for too long. I've tried the upgrade version of Windows 10 multiple times, and installing fresh copies multiple times. The problem persists.\n\nI've now lowered the number of stars, and I will also now look elsewhere for my next laptop purchase. Definitely won't be a Dell. And I'm not putting another $200 into this thing just for the problem to return again.\n______________________________________________________________________________________________\n______________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\nI want to start off by saying:\n\nFOR THOSE WHO THINK THIS LAPTOP IS SLOW:\nYou're partially correct. Mechanical hard drives are the main bottleneck in most modern computers nowadays. The 5400 RPM hard drive that is included with this laptop is no exception. Painfully slow, but some may want it for the capacity.\n\nI ordered a Solid State Drive when I ordered this laptop, and this thing flies! It boots up (and shuts down) in seconds. Every program opens near-instantly. No waiting, no lag.\n\nI deliberately purchased a refurb unit in hopes that some of the issues that others have had would be fixed. So far, that seems to be the case. I have had zero issues with this machine.\n\nI also purchase a wireless Logitech keyboard and mouse and have this laptop hooked up to a monitor while at home. This thing makes a perfect second desktop. The wireless Logitech keyboard/mouse combo only takes up one USB port, leaving  you still with two.\n\nI also love that this can either be a laptop, tablet, or desktop. This could be called a 3-in-1.\n\nThis unit is light, portable, and (for me) the perfect size for a portable laptop.\n\nFor those interested in this (or any other laptop), I implore you to purchase a Solid State Drive and replace the mechanical hard drive. It will speed the device up, save battery, and reduce heat. It's a win-win-win.\n\nI've been using this for a couple weeks and loving it."}

It's fast, slim, and yet sturdy. Keyboard is solid, precise; I've also had no issues with the touchpad or touchscreen. Tablet and tent functions work flawlessly. There's no noise, heat, or buggy issues.\n\nPart of the reason for this laptop's success is that it runs an operating system that it's made for--Windows 8 (which can be a disaster on a standard computer). Here on a touchscreen tablet-2-in-1 it's magic. It's quick and intuitive: I spent very little time trying to get my settings just perfect, unloading adware, filler programs, etc. Screen quality is great, HDMI output works wonderfully on a projector.\n\nCons: (1) the screen text is a bit small--and resizing it through \"Display\" settings only works for your computer's text, not websites. My eyesight isn't that bad yet I always feel like I'm having to get really close to the screen. The good thing is that with the touchscreen resizing is much easier, but it's still annoying that you can't get a more seamless text experience (2) camera quality is minimal, but if you're not using the tablet as a primary camera you should be fine."}

I am very pleased so far with the overall function of this laptop/tablet combo. I purchased the lower priced Pentium chip after researching the difference between that and the Core i3 chip, and reading that the Pentium outperforms some tasks and uses less power, so along with the price, it seemed to fit for me. As advertised by A.Warehouse Deals, it came in the original box and shows no signs of being \"used\". HOWEVER, the key board, though looking brand new, is not put together properly, which seems to be a manufacturing error, or possibly meant for a non US English language user. I did not notice this at first, as I normally type without looking at the keys, and the correct characters displayed on my screen. But when I did look for specific letter and symbol keys before typing, I realized that the key labeling on almost all of the symbols, and many of the letters are completely incorrect. I did not want to return the laptop, now that I have it cu tomized the way I want it and am happy with it otherwise. It is programmed correctly for US English, so as long as I type from finger memory, the outcome is correct. After contacting Amazon Warehouse Deals about this issue, they did issue me a 25% discount, which I found very satisfactory. So I am rating the laptop/tablet 5 stars, since I am very happy with it overall. Even though I have not used it for too long I have tried to test it in for all the regular home uses I will use it for, including multi functions, such as listening to CD's or MP3 music files, while using Kindle on the Tablet, as well as having many search windows open, along with g-mail, etc. I am not a gamer so I cannot speak to how the graphics performance is, but I did download the Autodesk SketchBook to use with the tablet function, and am enjoying this with the stylus I purchased.

Despite that, I do like it for how lightweight and portable it is that I can bring to and from home, also to my classes without feeling like I'm carrying an extra ten pounds in combination to my text books for class. I have back problems, so having a light computer like this really helps. Apart from that, there are a few reasons as to why I am only giving it three stars:\n\nWindows 8.1 -\nI know 8.1 was made to be for computers like this, but I have a hard time navigating it more than I would like to. I miss Windows 7 and being able to search my entire computer for something from a small start menu at the corner of my screen. Not only that, but having to switch screens every time I need to access the control panel gets pretty old. I am a university student and not being able to find assignments quickly to edit for my classes gets really annoying. Especially since I can't access Microsoft Word from my desk top. If I want it, I have to go to the Start screen and find it.\n\nTouchscreen and Onscreen Keyboard -\nThis bugger is one of the few annoyances I have run into with this computer. Ninety percent of the time when I start up the computer, does my onscreen keyboard pop up ready to act like a tablet when I don't want it to. If I wanted a tablet, I would have bought one. But I needed a computer. The combination of the two seemed like a good idea, if not a bit faulty. Do better Dell.\n\nTrackpad -\nWhere do I start with this? The trackpad overall doesn't respond a lot of the time when I start up my computer like it should. The mouse pointer shows up on my screen, but no response from said trackpad. This causes me to have to bend the screen all the way back to to almost touching the back of the keyboard, and bend back forward at least four times EVERY TIME I START UP THE COMPUTER. Not only that, when I move my finger on the trackpad sometimes to move the pointer across the screen, it switches to the Start screen when I don't want it to. When I actually do want it to, I can't figure out how to do it. This happens a lot when I'm doing something important, or trying to watch something. Also, the casing around the bottom of the trackpad is so thin, that I can left and right click my mouse from under the keyboard. It doesn't help when I just want to curl up on my bed and do some homework because god forbid I put normal pressure against the underside of the trackpad.\n\nCharger -\nAfter having lost my original charger for this computer, I tried contacting Dell to receive a replacement charger. Sadly, Dell's website has no available replacement chargers for this series. At all. Trying to contact them is like trying to get into a VIP room when you don't have a pass. I tried contacting dell like any person would by sending them an email. I couldn't do that, either. At least, not without an account. Nor could I find a phone number on their website. Anyway, after the struggle of trying to contact them, I settled on getting a Universal computer charger. I live in Alaska, we don't get chargers for this series of computers as easily or quickly as other models of computers. I wouldn't be surprised if chargers for this computer still don't exist in town yet. The Universal charger end for this computer broke because it was made from a third party, so I didn't have a computer for months. Luckily I have a spare computer, and was able to order a spare charger for the exact model. But going through trying to find a replacement was harrowing. I'll say it again, do better, Dell.\n\nFast Access Face Recognition -\nNot everyone wants it. End of story.\n\nWiFi Connection -\nIt won't connect to my university's highspeed internet for some reason. The wifi will connect to the older wifi profile but not the new one. I have been trying to get it to connect for a while now, but haven't figured out why it won't.\n\nOn the flip side, i do like this computer. It has nice speakers that get really loud. They're louder than my old computer's, which is amazing, and I love it. Also, the bluetooth is easy to connect to. I haven't had any trouble with it at all. So despite this being a very new model of computer on the market, it has its ups and downs. What I have listed are just some things I think Dell can improve on when making more of these for consumers. The concept is great. It really is, but like Windows, please perfect on these issues before placing them on the market. It would help us all out."}

I spent two hours setting it up and loading my programs only to get the black screen of death when attempting to restart. After an hour on the phone with Microsoft support (clearly outsourced to Asia given the difficulty understanding the support person), they declared it DOA and recommended that I return it to Amazon. Amazon offered to send a replacement but I have no interest in taking a chance on another Dell. I will go back to Toshiba with which I have had good luck in the past."}

The error message \"Plugged in, not Charging\" is displayed even when it really needs charging. Called the Dell Help desk and they couldn't fix the issue. The Dell Customer Service accepted the product is defective. They tried every setting and updated the BIOS firmware. They finally agreed to send a new one, but send us a Refurbished one. Though the DELL customer service act friendly, their service sucks. If you are willing to deal with this known issue and a head spinning customer service, take your chances. It is a nice little laptop for the price. We took our chances and we ended up returning it."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF3M", "review": "The Dell Inspiron 11.6 2 in 1 is a great laptop, as long as you know what to expect.\n\nAnd what's that? A device that'll do any basic computing tasks you might have, such as running a web browser, light photo management and editing, very light gaming, etc.\n\nThe \"flip\" feature is neat and useful, but the touchscreen alone is worth the price for those moments you'd rather just flick the screen or tap than use the keyboard. The best use-case I can see for using it like a gigantor-sized tablet is on the couch, reading with the tablet up against your knees.\n\nI thought I'd be bothered by the low resolution screen, but the truth of the matter is that at the normal distance you use it at, I don't notice it too much. When you use it like a tablet, that's another story, but even there, I find the pixels less obnoxious than a first-generation Surface, which had a comparable resolution.\n\nThe biggest irritation? The build quality is a little loose, and the keyboard flexes in the middle when pressed, or just when typed on. It's not much, and not a deal-breaker, but it really, really shouldn't happen. If they could double the battery life while they're at it, I'd also be willing to pay an extra hundred dollars - 5-6 hours is fine for most purposes, but the comfort of knowing you've got 10 hours or more on tap is pretty great.\n\nOverall, a great laptop at a great price. It's less of a compromise than many 2-in-1 computers I've played with."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF3M", "review": "Had for 2 weeks so far and generally pleased with the purchase.  Excellent screen, viewable from a wide range of angles, decent speakers for a laptop, excellent battery life, Windows 8 has a learning curve vs. earlier versions, but is OK once you find your way around. Usefully versatile - the tablet mode is great for reading printed pages in pdf documents in portrait mode. I was hesitant mainly because of negative comments about the keyboard (feel, bends slightly), but I don't have any issue with it.  There is no bloatware other than a couple of Dell applications, except for the apps preloaded with Windows 8. Cons:  It doesn't appear to be an especially fast machine with the Pentium, but is acceptable.  One of the USB 2 ports is rather tight, but I hope it will free up with use.  Screen image sometimes changes unexpectedly when I accidently invoke a gesture on the touch pad or move the cursor to a certain region of the screen.  The touch pad is OK but sometimes a little slow to respond.  I have a better pad on an old ASUS netbook.  But maybe adjusting the pad settings will help.  There is no ethernet port (the similar HP machine does have one), but I added one using an ethernet-USB adapter, and then used a crossover cable to connect with my old Windows XP machine to copy files using laplink without the need for a wireless connection.  Many apps require you to sign up for a microsoft account; this is also presented prominently during set up, but it is possible to refuse and create a local account for the machine.  If you don't wish to get a Microsoft a/c, they are of little or no use, and so far it's not clear how to remove them."}

The only thing I had problems with is that sometimes I had to reboot it to get the keyboard and mouse back up and running.  That happened twice but maybe I just didn't have patience to wait for it to reconnect correctly.  I'll withhold judgement on that until I've had it longer.\nI bought the dell because it had good reviews AND it had better slots than any other two in one of this size (and some bigger). The HDMI worked perfectly as did all the USB slots.  There's an SD slot too but I haven't tried that yet.\nI don't think I would buy this for my every day machine.

I have a full computer with full windows and i7 Intel processor and 12 gb ram...2 tb hd...yada yada and a ipad 3.  So I needed something to just be a portable machine. This really suprises me at every turn. I've run photo shop , Traktor Dj 2 with a midi controller , I've recorded podcast with it...I've had presentations with it. It performs as it should. The touch pad mouse is a little bug and glitchy but you can solve that with the touch screen or your own mouse. I'm using the stock  quad core pentium processor and the 4 GB of ram with the 500 GB 5400rpm hard drive.  This works fine for me. You can expand it to 8GB of ram and the hard drive to Solid State...bit of you are doing NORMAL stuff like: YouTube , Netflix , Hulu , web browsing , some photo editing...music, word documents, excel spreadsheets, PDFs ( 3 or 4 open) you will be fine. This is not meant to be a power machine but if you tech savvy you can have a awesome budget tuner machine. The flipping out and tablet modes are good too. It does have rubber feet around the keyboard. So the keys aren't engaged when sitting flat in tablet mode. Holding it as a tablet is different but I use mine on a desk or podium when public speaking. All that being said this tablet really shines and is a good little budget machine."}

Straight out of the box this thing looked great and felt very solid. The hinges for the convertible screen look and feel solid. I don't think they are going to break anytime soon. The plastic/metal combination case feels great, isn't a fingerprint magnet, and looks very professional. I am a large guy with large hands and this keyboard still feels very comfortable. The keys have decent travel and nice feedback. From reading previous reviews I was expecting this computer to be sort of slow but straight out of the box it has done everything I've asked of it with minimal lag. The only slow downs I have noticed have been related to the 5400rpm HD and nothing to do with the processor. The screen looks amazing for the resolution and build, and the touch is very quick and responsive. I only have two minor complaints with this computer so far. The brightness on the screen seems to change on it's own for no apparent reason occasionally. It doesn't do it often enough to cause me any issues though. The other thing is the track pad. It feels good and is very responsive to touch but it seems the gestures (such as two finger scrolling) don't seem to want to respond sometimes. These are both very minor complaints and not worth deducting a star. I will update this review after a few weeks of use.\n\n**Update**\n\nI had to take away a star for the trackpad. This this is infuriating. If you sit the computer at a slight angle, like sitting it on your lap, the upward pressure pushes the button! Like your clicking the mouse from the bottom. If you pick the computer up from the front close to the trackpad it clicks the button. Also, the right click seems to take up more than half of the bottom two buttons. I always end up right clicking when I try to left click. The only thing this trackpad does right is the sensitivity. It always registers my touch and almost always goes where  I want it to as long as I don't get to close to that right click button."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF3M", "review": "Out of the box you are very impressed with the function of the 2-1.  It is very smooth for internet and seemingly other uses but the bluetooth is a disaster.  I purchased this 2-1 laptop as a Xmas gift for my son and read some reviews on several laptops but didn't go to the Dell website which is what I should have done.  Another gentlemen who purchased this laptop spent two full days with Dell support who appeared to be very helpful and willing to assist but never came through meaning this is a real issue and they have no idea how to solve it.  And that issue is the bluetooth will connect but no more than about 2-4 minutes and it drops the connection and loses all sight of the connecting device.  THEN to top it off if you try to go into the PC and devices section to address it, the operating system locks up and you are forced to reboot the laptop to be able to access the bluetooth again.  Unreal.  How can you ship an item advertised as bluetooth when it doesn't even work?  I have a desktop that is 10yrs old from Dell and the bluetooth feature works just fine.  Truly unacceptable that they did not fix this problem or apparently even know about it before offering it to customers.  I will be returning it and purchasing something else.  Very unhappy personally but especially since my son is."}

It's small and has a very nice screen and very nice keyboard. I love the matte finish on the keyboard, which eliminates finger prints. The operating system seems to have a pretty good speed so far.\nThe convertible tablet is a really nice feature, too. When you're sitting with it in your lap. it's very convenient to be able to flatten it like a tablet. I LOVE the touchscreen, too. I was a little worried at first as to whether I would like this feature. But, it so much nicer than having to really on a keypad and a mouse. So easy to just touch or drag with your fingers."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF3M", "review": "I purchased this device after returning the XPS 11 because I needed a laptop, not a tablet. I got the Inspiron 11 on sale for $299 around Christmastime, and I took a chance on another 11\" convertible.\n\nIt's a great machine all around.\n\nForm Factor: This comes in at just around 3 pounds. Fits nicely in your bag, and isn't too terrible to hold with two hands as a tablet. I use it more in tent mode than in pure tablet mode. Holding with one hand is passable, but doesn't feel great as time goes by. Looks fairly sleek, but not futuristic like the XPS 11.\n\nPerformance: The processor surprised me on this one. I got the Pentium version, and I've always operated under the assumption that Pentiums were junk these days. Performance was sluggish with the 4GB/500GB stock combination, but the machine runs *very* quickly with the $60 120 GB SSD that I installed. Cold boot takes about 15 seconds, which is very impressive. Applications open almost as fast as my Core i7 Desktop beast. Multitasking causes the system to struggle just a tad, but it's more than fast enough if you understand that this is a $300-400 mobile device and not a desktop speed demon or a true ultrabook that costs two, three, or even four times as much.\n\nScreen: Looks great in laptop mode. If you're in tablet mode and hold it too close, you'll realize just how few pixels there are on the screen. Again, whenever I notice a flaw in this machine, I remember that I paid $299 + $60 SSD upgrade and I'm very happy. Touch screen is responsive and fun to use in tablet or tent mode.\n\nKeyboard: Keys are a little small, but I can type nearly as fast as on a full-size desktop keyboard. Some flex toward the middle, but nothing too bothersome. My biggest annoyance is the absence of a dedicated home/end page up/down keyset, but that's to be expected on a machine this size.\n\nTouchpad: Can be jerky, although it's better if you increase the sensitivity. Some build quality issues. It creaks noticeably if you accidentally try to click by pushing on the touchpad itself rather than the keys at the bottom.\n\nBattery Life: Very impressive for the size. I get about 6 hours doing normal tasks, and even longer than that if I'm logged into remote access through my job (i.e. the laptop isn't doing the actual computer processing, my work machine is)\n\nI wish I could have gotten the Core i3 version of this, but the price differential was too large to justify ($519 vs. $299 at the time I purchased.) The Pentium really impressed me for what I need, and I'm a big fan of the machine. Would very much recommend to others, so long as you're willing to upgrade to an SSD and are aware that the machine will lag a bit if you multitask too hard. For $350, you can barely get a decent tablet or cell phone these days, so a full-fledged laptop is really a great deal!\n\nUPDATE: I also added more RAM to this device, bringing it to 8 GB rather than the 4 GB that came pre-installed. Performance increase seems relatively minor, since I would imagine that the processor is the real bottleneck here. But, I can't imagine that it hurts, and the RAM was reasonably priced (plus I was able to repurpose the 4 GB DIMM in another machine). Even with the 8GB DIMM and the 120 GB SSD, my total cost on this machine is still $425+tax, so I'm a very happy camper."}

Being able to fold it back into a tablet is not something I really need and haven't used that feature but being able to scroll and zoom the screen and select with my fingers instead of the mouse is hugely helpful. Only a couple of gripes - the bottom of the laptop is a painted metallic/silver and easily scratches up and is a little flimsy. I would have appreciated more if it were black and a little stronger quality plastic for protection. The on off button is in a bad place (front side of bottom of unit) and I have accidentally turned it off several times when picking up the laptop or moving.

I use Macs at home and work and am the Apple tech in my dept.  But I like all operating systems and always have Windows via Parallels on my Macs.  I have liked Windows 8 from the start though it had some drawbacks before they (mostly) fixed them. Anyone who wants to understand why Microsoft created Windows 8 need only to use this computer.\n\nYes, I had to tweak the video settings but this is an issue with other Windows 8 devices I've used and not unique to this product.  With a regular laptop keyboard/form factor I can get my work done.  At home in my chair I mostly use it as a tablet (keyboard down) to get it closer to me.  That makes it kind of a 2 screen device.  One is small but usable as a laptop; the other is larger than the iPad as a tablet.  Or use HDMI to connect it to a larger monitor if needed.\n\nIn bed it's replaced my iPad.  Now it's a tablet with it's own infinitely adjustable stand.  I've had it for a few weeks and like it more every day.  I can tell you this:  I will never purchase another laptop that does not employ this form factor.\n\nAnother thing I'd like to mention is that from the beginning I've loved tablet screens in general better than most laptop screens.  I've wanted one the XPS models with the rotating screen but couldn't afford it.  This solved that problem.  Battery life is good.  Standby time is excellent.  How much time you get is as always dependent on screen brightness and what you're doing.\n\nI set up a Surface Pro 3 for one of our administrators the other day and I can tell you that if someone gave me a choice between this one and the Surface I'd choose this one at one third to one fourth the price.  Yes the Surface Pro 3 has a higher screen resolution but that was a problem for me (I'm in my 60's).  It was too high and things were too small.  I could adjust it to a point but not enough. Anyway why would someone want to type on either of those keyboards!\n\nI have had none of the issues that some early buyers had with the device.  That did give me pause but Dell's handling of these problems as reported by the users encouraged me to go ahead and buy it.  Right now, as far as I'm concerned, Dell is out-innovating Apple.  Kudos to Microsoft for making it possible."}

I really enjoy the keyboard. I thought I would have issues coming over from a full sized keyboard but the transition has been seamless.\n\n*Now the not so good.\nThis thing is slow. It pains me how slow it sometimes becomes. I think this 2 in 1 just cant handle a full version of windows 8.1. I removed a lot of the junk that came pre-loaded on the computer and it is still running slow. The track pad on this is less than desirable. At times, it becomes completely unresponsive and I have to use the touch screen.\n\nI think that the 2 in 1 is a great idea; however, I think that it could use some remodeling and re-engineering. Down the line I would definitely try a new and improved model."}

You can find this driver if you search for \"Owner's Thread: Dell Inspiron 11 3147 2-in-1\" (it is on page 19 post #185).\n\nFinally, the price difference of over $100 between this one and the one with Core i3 is really not worth it.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF3M", "review": "I bought the Dell Inspiron i3147-3750sLV after Black Friday at staples for a few dollars cheaper than Amazon. Overall I'm extremely happy with this PC. It came with N3530 Pentium processor (based on the new atom cores), a 500 gigabyte 5400rpm drive, 4gb low voltage ram, a 3/4 full-sized keyboard, and a 11.6\" IPS display.\n\nPerformance: The performance of this machine isn't close to an I7 in speed, but it performs extremely well for average laptop use, and as a student I don't expect any problems for my use. With an SSD upgrade and keeping in mind it's built on low powered cores(7TDP), it is an especially good performer. I never booted from the 500 gigabyte mechanical drive or the factory installed Windows, so I can't testify to the speed a lot of people experience. I booted the default configuration upon arrival to make sure the HDD worked, but immediately replaced it with a 7mm SSD(Could not close the case with 9.5mm drive) and reinstalled Win 8.1. Benchmarking the machine I got a Peacekeeper score of 1500(Acer C720 chromebook gets 3000), and Novabench score of CPU/GPU: 289/27 (I3 CPU/GPU: 280/88). Although it runs Netflix and Amazon instant very well, I imagine trying to run games outside the Windows store is absolutely futile. Also, to compensate for the reduced storage of my SSD upgrade, I purchased an SD card after discovering the SD slot accepts the card nearly the entire card with only enough sticking out to pinch and remove it.\n\nAesthetic/Feel: It has a very nice feel and look. The case feels very solid, is thin, and is a good weight for what it is. I would not necessarily try to hold it like a tablet, but with as large as the screen is I wouldn't try that anyway. It is very easy to put in your lap or cradle in one arm and use the touchscreen with the other. The touchscreen is very responsive, excellent quality, and has awesome viewing angles(Thanks IPS screen!). It's the best quality screen I've had on a sub $600 laptop. I've not had any \"ghost touches\" some reviewers report. The keyboard is a good size and is pleasant and very usable. It's true there is some bend in the keyboard, but there is no bend anywhere else in the frame, and I don't feel as if I'm going to press a key through the keyboard either. I have experienced what some users report with the keyboard not responding after being in tablet mode, but that has only happened 1 out of probably 100 or more flips; I put the computer back in to tablet mode, then closed it and it was functioning again upon opening. I think it was a result of turning it to tablet as I was booting.\n\nHeat: some reviewers mentioned excessive heat with tablet or tenting mode. While it is true it heats up slightly more than in laptop mode. I measured the CPU heat with CPUID while in light use, after streaming video in laptop, tent, and tablet unplugged on a hard surface. The baseline CPU temp 109f turned on. Watching video it climbed to 140 but the fan kicks in around that and the temp went to 125 within a minute. I transitioned it to tent mode and in five minutes it dropped to 130 after the fan activated. I put it back into laptop mode and it dropped again to 125, then switched it to tablet mode on a surface and it went to 130 after the fan turned on. Tablet usage on lap with fan facing away also has the same temp and it actually got hotter (135) just browsing in laptop mode on my lap. So there is slightly more heat, but people might just be noticing the heat transference after a half hour of usage. Obviously blocking the fan in tablet mode will also create quite a lot of heat, but if the fan were to run continuously I doubt it would break 115f.\n#Edit: Watching a 2-hour movie in tent mode did make the computer feel much hotter than watching it in laptop mode, but the CPU temperature still reported a max of 134.\n\nLinux: I tested the PC with Ubuntu 14.10 and it worked wonderfully. First boot I ran into the shutdown issue I've read about elsewhere, however after updating the bios in Windows from version 2 to 3, there has been no issues with rebooting or suspending on Linux. There is 100% compatibility as far as I know. The only thing I have not tried yet is the SD card, but I will update that as soon as it arrives. Linux even enables me to use two finger scrolling/swipe on the touchpad, something I haven't been able to do in Windows yet-Although installing synaptic on a fresh install made it easier to use, I cannot change any settings not available in the generic `Mouse' settings. Linux feels a bit faster than Windows on this machine also. The only problem is Ubuntu (gnome or unity) does not allow full use of the touchscreen-there is no automatic onscreen keyboard, chrome browser only allows touchscreen scrolling when started by touch, and I could only use the left->right swipe to open activities in Gnome 3.14(upgraded from Ubuntu 14.10). This is a problem since there has not been as much manpower to make these work compared to Windows 8. As Fedora 21 gets released tomorrow I will update it further after testing the latest Linux kernel.\n\n#Edit: Ubuntu sees the SD card. Fedora 21 has much better immediately satisfying touchscreen use. From booting in the live environment the touchscreen is immediately responsive to left-to-right swiping the activities and down swiping to open up menus. Unfortunately one of the reasons I never used Fedora before and likely won't start is there were some slowdowns once I installed it that I couldn't figure out how to fix.\nI installed and played Block Story(Similar to Minecraft) with medium graphics settings, and it ran very well. Although I did not test frames-rates, I had no lagging or dropped frames.\n\nUsage: I've not been using it like I normally do since I've been out of  school, but I've used it for typing this review and several other things and have enjoyed typing on it more than my old 15 inch computers. I've also used it a lot in tablet mode some for video watching and light browsing and the onscreen keyboard in windows 8 is very usable. My favorite way to use it (besides laptop) is actually flat on my lap while lounging and watching television. It allows full use of the keyboard without laying the computer at awkward angles."}

After paying to have my laptop fixed, Dell ended up returning it to their warehouse instead of me.  Their solution was to provide me with a refurbished laptop.  My biggest concern to this was the fact that I had specifically asked for my hard drive not to be reformatted or a new operating system installed.  When I asked Farat Herman, Client Technical Support Specialist, why he could not track my laptop's location at the warehouse, his initial response was that it probably was re-issued to another customer.  However he had no work order or actual proof that it was not sent out with my personal information as well as confidential company information.  When I mentioned this, he then claimed it was probably tagged for destruction.  WHAT????  First it was sent to a customer and now it is tagged for destruction?!?!?!  He really had no idea what was happening with it and tried to placate me with any line he could think of.  In the end I finally said, fine send me a refurb laptop, but I want a refund since I did not get what I paid for since what I paid for was MY laptop back with all of MY information on it.  He said \"No, there is nothing else I can offer, and I speak on behalf of the President of Dell.  There is no one else that this issue can escalate to.\"  I can't tell you how frustrated and let down I feel from this company and their service.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF3M", "review": "I love this laptop / tablet.  This 2 in 1 was a perfect fit for me.  At first, I was worried about it being too slow, however, after uninstalling all the Dell bloatware it is actually pretty darn fast and reliable.  It's the perfect size for being a tablet and computer.  It's light weight and easy to use in the field for troubleshooting IT issues.  I recommend purchasing a USB to Ethernet adapter.  It only has a wireless adapter.  I love the battery life.  I usually see about 2 hours on my laptop and get between 4 - 6 hours on this machine easy.\n\nNow I'm going to go against the gain and admit I love Windows 8.1.  I'm not sure why it gets a bad rap.  It's perfect for tablet-like features and apps but also great in a production environment.  Install the Windows 8 RSAT tools and it's great for managing remote Windows 2012 servers and Hyper-v VMs.\n\nThe Windows store needs some help but I can't blame that on this computer.  I wish Amazon would release an Instant Video app.  But since this is a full computer I can watch it through a web browser until one (if ever) is released.  I've used it to stream DVD and Blu-ray MKVs across the network with no stuttering.  I get over 10Mbps which is OK for wireless N.\n\nHonestly, it's hard to say anything bad about this unit.  If I had to complain just to complain, the touchpad seems a little sensitive when I'm trying to type.  The cursor jumps around a bit when I don't expect it to.  I'm learning to pick up my thumbs (when I type) and it doesn't happen as much.  Other than that, this machine is great.  I have no complaints."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF3M", "review": "A great laptop/tablet at a great price.\n\nAs someone who's gotten so spoiled by the touchscreens on my smaller devices that I actually find myself touching non-touch screens out of force of habit, getting a laptop with touch capability was essential. I didn't want to spend more than $500, and this actually came in $100 under that.\n\nSure, for more money you can get a faster laptop, but this one so far runs all the basics, plus even games like Civilization IV, perfectly well. Video is smooth. I've yet to throw enough at it to make it crash or slow down.\n\nIt feels durable, particularly the hinges, which were of most concern. After gingerly flipping from laptop to tablet mode for the first week, I realized I didn't need to be so sensitive - they're pretty solid, and seem like they'll last the life of the laptop.\n\nSince it folds rather than detaches, the full tablet mode is a little clunky. I notice this especially when I read comics on it - it's a little heavy, and feeling the keyboard on my hand or lap is a little odd. It's also pretty easy to bump the button in the center of the screen that flips everything back to the home screen. But for other things, you can easily use the touch screen at another angle and rest it on a table or your lap.\n\nI would recommend this to anyone looking for a good, sturdy, portable laptop with a touchscreen."}

The whole device was warped.  Set it on a flat surface and it rocked liked a rocking chair.  The keyboard was also unusable in the sense that when typing, the entire board area would flex and pressing a key with any finger would result in a tingling like vibration throughout the keyboard that could be felt on all fingers in contact with any other keys.  I suspect though this might also have been a result of the warped body/frame of the device.\n\nCompared to the Lenovo Yoga 11.6 inch 2-in-1, it's a better deal in that for less money it has an extra USB port, a standard HDMI cable port (vs. the mini port on the Yoga) and a standard power port (vs. the proprietary port on the Yoga).

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF3M", "review": "Buyer beware!!  This laptop on paper sounds like a good idea, in fact had Dell done a good job of designing it, it would have been great.  I got mine a couple months ago and it is a nightmare.  The thing scratches  incredibly easily, when I got mine it was already scratched.  I looked into buying a lid replacement but they apparently don't have those in stock.  Then it has little rubber guards to protect the laptop when you place it on a surface, the other day while using it as a tablet one of them just fell off- mind you it's two months old.  But neither of those two things is the reason this gets a 1 star review, my problem with this is the touchscreen and Dell's Customer Support.  This laptop is extremely prone to detecting \"ghost touches\" - that is, the touchscreen acts as if you are touching it and relays visual feedback as if you had touched even if you aren't touching it.  This has huge implications which make this basically none usable.  It will scroll down on it's own, close down programs or even documents because very often it detects ghost touches on the top right hand corner where the \"X\" for closing out a program is found.  The only way to end these ghost touches is to restart, and then hope it lasts a couple hours before starting up again.  When I contacted Dell about this, after extensive troubleshooting the representative suggested that my last option would be to reset the laptop to factory condition- hence losing anything I had saved here.  As this is my only laptop I had no where to move my stuff so I was prompted by the agent to go buy an external hard drive so we could try one more stop that would possibly, although probably not work.  When I told him I was not going to go spend $50 on something that just might work (I know I should have one of these anyhow) they told me needed to send it in to one of their warehouses.  I live in Costa Rica, so I asked him if I could get help locally after all there is a Dell Store 2 miles from my home and Dell also has Customer Support for Costa Rica.  Their answer? Nope, I have to send it to the US as they will only cover any assistance that is given there.  Well Fedex is going to charge me $90 to send it there, $90 to get it sent back- plus local taxes I will have to pay for bringing in electronic equipment once it returns- at the very least $100.  So now I am going to end up paying $280 to repair a two month old $450 dollar laptop.  This is my first and probably my last Dell, and the second time I have had a bad experience buying things online in the last month.  I usually try to buy online as it is cheaper but I am coming to realize that is costing me more than it is saving me when all is said and done.  My recommendation- DON'T BUY... and if you do, buy at a local store where you can walk in and demand a refund or fix on the spot which will save you the hassle of dealing with the \"World's best customer support\" as Dell calls itself."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF3M", "review": "The positive reviews on this laptop/tablet/propped up touch screen/laptop with touchscreen speak for themselves. The device is a piece of art and genius ingenuity.  A lot of people simply like the idea of having a keyboard that is permanently attached allowing the device to have more power than most of the mobile devices out on the market.\n\n1. The screen.  I was concerned about this.  Coming from an LG G2 phone with high quality resolution, I was a bit skeptical of this laptops native resolution.  The laptop does not disappoint in screen quality for me. No text are not as razor sharp as the LG G2, but they are plenty good, and the color pop!!  I have found for all of these full windows 8 tablets/pcs while the picture color is good, you can make it that much better through some minor adjustments. Right clicking on desktop you can go to graphic properties, click on display, click on the color tab. Leaving brightness at 0 and contrast at 50, I found that bringing down the gamma a bit made the pictures look like a Panasonic TV in terms of contrast.\n\nThe keyboard: My initial concern reading some of the reviews would be that this keyboard would be like some of those mini keyboards you see for the ipad 3/ size tablets. On the contrary, I find the keys on this to be very comfortable and spaced out. They are a bit smaller, but nothing not as small as some of those keyboards for ipads or other tablets.  I could type on this for hours as I am quickly typing here as I write this review and feel fine. Also when you flip it over, YES, the keyboard does disable. Meaning you can use this as a tablet and not have to worry about the keyboard.\n\nThe mouse in tablet mode:  When you flip it over to tablet mode, one would expect that the mouse would lock just like the keyboard.  Indeed, that is exactly what it is supposed to do. There is a program called quickset, that manages this in tablet mode. For some reason some people are experiencing that while the computer locks the keyboard in tablet mode the mouse is still active. For those who are having this issue there is an easy fix.  One should go to my computer, open the c: drive, go to program files (regular not x86), click on the folder that says dell, and click on the folder that says quickset. At this point a list of icons will show up.  You will want to right click on the icon that says \"QS\" or \"quickset\"  go down to send to and send it to the desktop.  What this does is allows one an easy access to manually turning off the mouse within less than 10 seconds after turning it over into tablet mode.  Im not sure if its my drivers installed, if its a windows update that caused this or what it is. But some have experienced this and having that program on the desktop is an easy quick fix to the problem.\n\nSome people have given this tablet a negative rating due to the trackpad. They have stated that the trackpad is a bit slow. There is an easy and permanent fix for this. If you to your app screen, you can click the search icon in the upper right corner. Search for control panel. Open it up and view by large icons. You will want to click on the mouse icon.  Going to the 4th tab once you have opened the mouse settings, you can control the pointer speed. Hit apply all set. My trackpad is super responsive.\n\nThe vent:  It does its job fine, but needs respect due to the nature of what this is (a fully functional laptop with an intel chip inside). The laptop puts out very little heart.  Compared to my old HP this thing puts out next to nothing.  When multitasking it can get warm like any laptop, but never hot.  Still in tablet mode, when you flip that screen over, the vent needs to be respected. Make sure that you hands are not blocking it or the vent isn't resting down and being blocked. Initially some might say that this is a reason to go with a tablet over a laptop. However the tradeoff to being respectful of this vent, is that you get much faster speeds, a larger hard drive, and much greater versatility on the spot with full Intel chips.  That is the number one reason why I like this. It functions like a laptop, it functions like a tablet, unlike the ones with screens that come off and the computer is in the screen, you can hook up external dvd rom drives, have have 3 usb ports.\n\nApps: They are growing fast! If your an app person...Microsoft's weather app is the best weather app I have seen. Its better than apples, its better than Samsung's Accuweather.  The radar is easy to access, its very user friendly. But windows has all your basic apps and more now.  They have facebook, painting apps, youtube apps, alarm apps, microphone apps, news apps, game apps...THEY EVEN HAVE A GOOGLE SEARCH APP. (Meaning): You can use your voice to search  The first time you open the app you have to allow the app access to the microphone, but the mic on this is a lot better, faster and more responsive than any Samsung tablet Ive used so I like using google talk.\n\nSpeakers: Im very very impressed. Better than my 17 inch HP g7 laptop. They are plenty loud for me but really I don't care about PC speakers because I usually use headphones for music and movies. the device has blutooth so you can even connect wireless headphones.\n\nBrightness: Directly on, the screen is plenty bright. It can go plenty high as well for high and for low light situations.\n\nWindows button on Monitor itself: Very useful.\n\nLast thoughts:\n1. You can upgrade the ram to 8gb.\n\n2. You can change the 500gb disk hard drive to a solid state drive (which is much much faster even though this is already a fairly zippy machine).\n\n3. You can easily hook this up to a monitor using a standard size HDMI port. No conversion cables necessary just plain old HDMI. Plug. Play.\n\n4. Good battery life for a laptop.  I'm getting about 6-8 depending on how I use it.  If you switch to a solid state drive you will get more. 6-8 is typical of a tablet so for a fully functioning laptop to get 6-8 with a true Intel Pentium inside your looking at good battery life.\n\n5. What about external monitors?  If your monitor doesn't have HDMI, it likely has DVI.  HDMI to DVI cords are cheap to buy and work just fine.\n\n6. This tablet has mirror cast.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\n\nI have owned many electronic gadgets over the years.  I really enjoy tablets and love cell phones. But this is one my new favorites. You can make it whatever you want it to be and windows apps are growing every day. I was planning on using an android galaxy tab pro as a replacement desktop/laptop. Tried it for a week and sold it. While the display looked great there is nothing like having a desktop where to store stuff, the ability to buy an external DVD play and have it work just fine for DVD movies and games, and the functionality of again, whatever you want it to be.\n\nReally if your looking for a tablet but are torn between the tablet and laptop infrastructure, but want something with faster speeds and more versatility than the tablets that disconnect from the keyboard and are tablets on their own (Like having the ability at a moments notice to plug in an external DVD player and CD RW drive via USB), then this is an excellent choice. The 11.6 screen is great for mobility and is a perfect cross over."}

It works ok as a slow, compact laptop but if you just wanted a laptop, there are many other high-quality choices.  It's - supposed - advantage is that it converts from laptop to tablet and back, but this is only nominally true.\n\nFirst:  Dell does not sell a stylus that works with this so you have to purchase one at a retail store like Best Buy.  The stylus' that will work with this touchscreen are limited and clumsy.  The screen is not responsive so the best you can do is mimic the hit-or-miss crayon scrawls of a child.\n\nSecond:  When you convert from laptop to tablet and back, all hell breaks loose. Browsers freeze up with little shadowed circles flashing on and off at the edges of the screen.  The edge of the screen is large unresponsive, like when you are trying to close a browser window or attempting scroll up and down a page. Pages open, close, minimize, expand, scroll up and down, freeze at will.\n\nThird:  If you use it as a tablet and then want to go back to the laptop functionality, you have to re-start.  This is not how it's designed but at a minimum, half the time I've attempted to do this the keyboard and mouse pad will not work until the computer is restarted.  Sometimes it take 2-3 restarts to get the system to recognize the keyboard and mouse again."}

The processor was briskly responsive to all my word processing, research, and online education needs with fast streaming video and audio.\nThen, halfway through my first term in grad school, eight keys on my keyboard stopped functioning. Two hours with a tech and remote diagnostics revealed a hardware failure and Dell sent me a prepaid UPS label for GROUND SERVICE.\nTo Dells's credit, the repair only took a 48 hour turnaround and the return shipping is being sent express.\nWould have been a 4-star review if it weren't for the hardware failure."}

The the keyboard completely stopped working...it had always had some lag and the touch pad was a little weird from the get go.  Wanted to love it and spent hours last night on line with it trouble shooting and reading up on keyboard problems that seem to be way too common.  It's going back to Amazon today.  Not spending the time on the phone with a Dell tech.  I have had Dell products before and if this is an example of what they have become I won't step foot near another Dell. You are warned!

I promptly disassembled it (which simply involved removing the screws from the bottom - much easier than most net-books) and removed the original drive.  I partitioned a Samsung SSD to two drives, and installed the original Win 8.1 system to one and installed it.  I used a USB with  the Ubuntu 14.10 install to put it on the other logical drive.  You have to disable the rapid boot to get to the dual boot mode at start-up.  Start-up in the dual boot mode for Windows goes from 5 seconds to 25 seconds.  This version of Linux does not perform as well as Windows on the touch screen, but I prefer it to Windows for everything else.  This version of Ubuntu does not seem to have the Opera browser available on it.\n\nPros- Fast processor for decent price.\n  - Decent screen\n  - Good sound\n  - Reasonably light for a full function computer\n  - Battery and hard drive easily replaceable\n  - Easy to open to make modifications and replace battery after taking all the screws out of the base.\n\nCons\n  -Plastic case is sturdy, but not much for appearance\n  - Keyboard does not have a quality feel to it, but the tactile response of the keyboard is great, and a pleasure to type on.\n - No hard drive activity light\n - No lighted keyboard\n\nI have owned it for two months.  I would purchase it again.\n\nUpdate March 29, 2015\nAfter 6 months of using it I still was unable to become facile with windows 8. I wiped the SSD and installed windows 7 Pro and tried to have the dual boot with Ubuntu. I never was able to get the Ubuntu to shut down and load properly - it was easier to use Ubuntu running on the USB 3.0 port from a USB 3.0 flash drive. After never being fully happy with the computer, I purchased a used Latitude E6230 12.5\" on Ebay for $320 that I am much happier with. It is heavier, no touch screen ( I found the touch screen not to be of any benefit to me). I am using Ubuntu on the USB 3.0 port from the flash drive with no difficulty.\nI still consider it a great value for the cost, but it just was not for me.\nAfter reinstall of original hard drive I hope my son finds it to his liking."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF3M", "review": "I bought this for NaNoWriMo. Got it on Oct 29th, had it all set up and ready to go. Love the light weight but study construction and the convenience of a convertible laptop/tablet. The processor speed is good. So why do I give it two stars? Because it keeps giving me problems. First of all, I had a hard time getting extra language packs installed. The touchpad driver is fickle and I think it conflicts with the touchscreen driver sometimes, making the cursor go away or freeze up quite a bit. Then it gives me a black screen on boot-up a week after I got this. I had to play around with it for a hour and finally reflesh my Windows installation. It took me almost two hours to get all the software installed again. Two hours that I could have been writing. Afterward it still boots up very slowly, and it freezes up a lot. Then today, just shy of two weeks since I got it, it got stuck on Windows Update and cannot start Windows. Dell tech support advise me to get the product replaced. I cannot believe that I wasted the whole night and still can't get this thing to work, and it will be another two days before I get the replacement. So much for writing!\n\nBottom line is: this machine has good spec for the bucks, but the software sucks. I used to have good luck with Dell products, but I am very disappointed with this one."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF3M", "review": "Hello!  I got this little netbook/entry level ultra book to replace a full size laptop and a 7 inch android tablet.  Just like many other users i felt that windows 8.1 is annoying (I love my windows phone), is a little under powered and the come of the components (touch pad, and chassis) on it doesn't feel as solid as it should feel. I also had the annoying problem of the rough touch pad being in consistent with me when I was trying to use it.  After using the laptop for a day and with the intention of returning it I went to Costco, best buy, office depot and the Microsoft store to test out all the laptops on demo; but at the end of the day I have decided to keep this laptop even with all of those short coming and here is why.\n\n(Some personal opinion with some market research)\nFirst of all most of the laptops in this price range with similar configuration cost around the same as this laptop but none of these laptops (HP 2 in 1 that use the same processor, Lenovo again with the same process but with a non upgradable ram, and ASUS transformer) would offer the same upgradeability, size, power, screen quality and battery life as this laptop (so yes they are all kind of slow) It is true that I can get a full size laptop with a more powerful processor but again I got this laptop because of the size and that was a big deciding factor for me.  In my opinion there are three other types of laptops that is available on the market with a similar size form and battery life as this laptop but with a huge upgrade in speed (mac books, ultra books, and chrome books) but here is why I didn't pick them over this laptop.  The mac book and ultra books are beautiful, powerful and runs forever but the closest laptop that was just as slim was an hp ultra book priced at around $600 which I don't have a budget for.  The chrome books are just beautiful, fast and smooth for just around $200 but as an engineering student and it would impossible for me to own a device where I can't run any engineering, MS word, PowerPoint and other windows program on. (if I was in a major that would just require word I would gladly use buy a chrome book.)\n\n(Some ways around some common issue of this machine)\nAt this point I have come to terms with some of the limitations that I will have with this laptop (such as the over all speed, build quality, etc) but I did find some ways to go around some of the issue I encounter with this machine.\n-I have found out that I can set the touch pressure, pointer speed and palm reject  with a software included in the control panel under the mouse setting.  I found that by setting the touch pressure to min, palm reject to max, and increase the point speed I was able to get the touch pad to behave like a normal touch pad.\n-To make things a little quicker I remove McAfee anti virus from the computer.  Windows 8.1 come standard with windows defender which have proven to be very simple to use and effective over the years.\n-Ccleaner is a very great tool to have to free up some junk left over by the extra dell software and usually would restore some speed to the machine.\n-There is no way around Windows 8.1 and it does feel a little clunky even coming from someone who has a windows phone.  My suggest to that is that for the user to take your laptop (doesn't matter what make, model as long as is windows) to your local windows store to have their employees take you on a tour through windows 8.1.\n\nAt this point this is all I have to say about this laptop and I will update this review when I spend some more time on it.  In case I didn't mention this before but the battery life on this thing is simply amazing which would easily make up for some extra time it takes to load a youtube video.  I hope this review would give someone who is interested in this product or are thinking of returning this product a reason why they should buy it or keep it. Thanks for reading my review.\n\nUpdate: (Replaced factory hard drive with SSD hard drive)\nI decide to replace the factory hard drive with a solid state hard drive to increase the processing speed and battery life a little bit. Due to the limitation in the factory recovery software I was not able to just restore windows with a recovery SD card.  I had to use a hard drive cloning software with a cable to complete the hard drive replacement. http://www.amazon.com/Crucial-Laptop-Install-Kit-2-5/dp/B00C981DDY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1416009448&sr=8-1&keywords=crucial+kit\nand this is the hard drive I got.\n http://www.amazon.com/Kingston-Digital-Adapter-SV300S37A-240G/dp/B00A1ZTZNM/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1416009471&sr=8-2&keywords=kingston+ssd+v300\n\nFyi this laptop use a 7mm laptop with no extra adaptors so you won't need to get the ssd installation kit with the bracket.\n\nUpdate: Screen Calibration\nI had an issue with the touch screen being unresponsive.  The screen became a lot more responsive (almost perfect) after performing a screen calibration which can be found by typing \"screen calibration\" at the start screen."}

Windows 8 does take some getting used to, but if you have a windows phone or an xbox it won't be totally foreign, and you do have the option to toggle between the windows screen and a standard desktop so it's really just the change to the start menu that takes some getting used to. It's durable and convenient and the enclosed keyboard helps keep things from messing with your keys. I did have a keyboard issue that required repairs but Dell's customer service was really great about it and the warranty covered the repair. I'm not a big touchscreen person, so a keyboard was a must for me, but the ability to fold the computer in half and use it as a tablet is super convenient."}

After using it for 20 minutes the touchscreen. stopped working.  It took 2 hours on the phone with Dell to get it working. However, it is certainly not very responsive--a lot worse than my ipad.  I couldn't get easy transfer to work, so I haven't transferred the data from my old computer.  This Dell also seems to be very slow compared to my old Toshiba.  I realize that part of my annoyancee with this computer is that Windows 8 is such a pain.  I'm still deciding if it's worth countless hours to get used to this computer.  If I did decide to return it, I would not get another touchscreen computer because it seems that the touchscreens aren't that good yet. If I keep this Dell and like it better, I will do an update. But for now, I regret buying it."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF3M", "review": "A few months before I had bought this Inspiron 2-in-1 laptop, I was looking for a new laptop for school. I previously had a Toshiba Satellite that I had got for a birthday gift/graduation present from my mother. It was from 2010 and the laptop was slowing down, even though I always ran all the proper software to keep it going fast. It did its job and it was time to replace it. I was looking for something light and portable that had a good battery life. As i am a college student, I need the battery life and an excellent keyboard to take notes with. With this, I can't be happier with what I have.\n\nFor $400, you get a quad-core Intel processor. Even though it isn't a part of the Intel Core i series, the Pentium in this bad boy definitely does the job. From being shut down, I can have this booted to the start screen in less than 15 seconds, which is half the time that my desktop can do with an SSD (solid state drive) in it. Anybody who knows about computer building and operation knows that an SSD is at least 10x faster than a 7200 rpm HDD (standard mechanical hard drive). With this having a 5400 rpm HDD in it, I couldn't believe the performance I get from this. I prefer to work on this rather than my desktop with my 32 inch flat screen as my monitor.\n\nWorking on this, I feel like I am more professional and can take a lot better notes than what I could ever do with my old Toshiba. For about 2 weeks, I was on the fence about buying this laptop. I waited for the price to come back down to $399.99 (from $429.99). I have loved working on this ever since I pulled it out of its packaging. If you are a college student who needs something good for class work or a business man who is looking for something to take to his meetings and work on his work at home, this is your computer. Look no further.\n\nOh and I forgot to mention, Amazon is selling this $50 less than Dell themselves are selling it at. The 2-in-1 at this price from Dell directly only has a dual core Celeron processor in it. Buy it here and get 2 extra cores and a little more clock speed for free. What are you waiting for?"}

I don't like to carry around a portable desk top, I have a 17\" laptop, a 15.6\" laptop and a 11.6 Chromebook. I used the Chrome book the most out of all of them out of convenience and ease of use.

Like  Programming Micro Controllers directly from it and running network and test specific software for electrical design. This little PC has the power and the size I need to do my work almost anywhere. If you are looking for a tablet though I would highly recommend an Android device as Microsoft Tablets do not have any good apps for a tablet experience. If you are looking to use your Laptop in a tablet mode then this is the one you are looking for. I find that using a laptop in Tablet mode it more of a novelty than a convenience. But that is more of a personal choice. Overall I give it five stars for comfortable keyboard good battery life smooth touch screen and touch pad response. Boots up quickly and programs run smoothly.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF3M", "review": "This my third Dell PC. My experience with their products has without question been wonderful. They work and just keep working. Until this most recent purchase I've never had a reason to call Dell Support for anything. The purchase of this 2 in 1 changed that.\n\nIt is important to note that whenever I purchase a new PC the first thing I do is check the manufacturer's website for updates and apply all those that are recommended. This was done with this 2 in 1 as well.\n\nAlmost immediately the touchscreen feature had stopped working. There was no obvious pattern of use to cause this. The only fix was to restart the PC. The touchscreen would then work for a while, but always at some indeterminate point again stop working. This lead to my first call ever to Dell support.\n\nWhile it was clear by the name and accent, I was speaking with someone offshore, he was most courteous and very professional. After explaining the problem, he took me to the Dell download area where (after installing remote control) he again installed all the same updates I has previously installed. It made no difference.\n\nAs I was away from home when placing this call it was agreed I would monitor the problem and call back when I returned home to determine what next would be done.\n\nA few days later when checking the notification area, I discovered the battery status indicator seemed to be reporting erroneous information. Although the PC was plugged in and the green light on the brick was on, the indicator reported in was at 90%, plugged in but not charging? The unit had been plugged in for the previous 12 hours and not used. It should have shown a fully charged condition.\n\nI monitored this for a few days, noting the erroneous battery status report seemed to come and go and the amount of power remaining seemed to change, again there was no pattern of use that lead to this condition. During this time the PC remained on AC power for fear there was something wrong with the battery itself.\n\nAs I was still away from home and dependent upon this PC for light work duties, I contacted Dell support a second time. Again going offshore, I spoke with another representative who did exactly what the first rep had done, but to no avail. After it was determined applying the updates did not correct the problem, this rep agreed to send a Dell technician to my location to physically inspect and repair the PC.\n\nIt is important to note this onsite service was something I did NOT have to pay for. Dell provided it as a one-time courtesy because of my situation being away from home and needing the PC. They were under no obligation to do that for me, but did. The tech rep arrived a few day later, swapped-out the motherboard, power port and exchanged the AC cable and adapter.\n\nWhen he completed the work and re-checked the battery status, the erroneous readings were still present. He concluded the PC needed to be shipped to the Dell repair depot for a thorough inspection and to arrange for this with Dell support. As the unit was less than a month old the warranty should cover everything.\n\nA few hours after the rep had left, I had reason to put the PC in the tent mode to watch a movie and discovered the screen image no longer would rotate 180 degrees when the unit was flipped. However both left and right portrait modes worked as did the standard laptop landscape mode.\n\n(To those who would tell me about the keyboard buttons to manually rotate the screen. Yes, I was aware of them. They were not required as the rotation occurred automatically whenever the PC was repositioned. However, once it stopped rotating automatically the buttons were tried. They worked, EXCEPT for the tent mode.)\n\nThis was yet a new development on this PC, as the tent mode had been being used extensively and without problem since the unit was first received. My third and final call to Dell support was placed. Another friendly and professional representative did their best to help me, do EXACTLY the same as did the first two, but to no avail. We made arrangements to have a return shipping box sent to my home and to be there after I had returned from my trip.\n\nOn my return home from my trip, a stop for the night at a hotel and an attempt to catch up on some work, I got out the 2 in 1 and tried to turn it on. It would not start. I was completely unresponsive on both AC and battery. The unit appeared dead.\n\nWhen I arrived home and checked on my desktop PC, I saw that Dell had followed up with emails keeping me informed of the status of the box en route to me. The box arrived as promised and on schedule. The box, more than adequate packing to isolate and protect the PC during shipment, instructions and a pre-printed return label via FedEx ground. This problem-plagued PC is now on its way back to Dell for repairs.\n\nAs you would expect Dell notified me upon their receipt of the PC at the repair depot. As the unit moved from one department to another its status was posted to their website. When the repairs were completed and it was shipped back another email was sent notifying me to expect it, along with package tracking information.\n\nUPDATE...\n\nNeedless to say, when the PC arrived, I was excited to have a now fully functional machine. Unfortunately, that was not the case. Upon opening the outer carton I immediately became aware of the shoddy packaging effort. The bag the unit was to be in was laying unused in the bottom of the carton. The material intended to isolate the PC was ill-fitting, allowing a significant amount of movement within the carton itself.\n\nOn top over everything was a single slip of paper. A photocopy that appeared to have been a copy of a copy of a copy, etc., to the point it was barely legible. On it was a series of checkboxes of different work that could be performed. A single box was checked: \"reinstalled operating system.\" My heart sank realizing full well the problems this PC had were hardware-related and the (likely) nothing had been repaired.\n\nMy suspicions proved true when I booted-up the \"repaired\" machine. All of the problems it left with, were still present. It is important to note I included a detailed 2 page summary covering everything that had been discussed with Dell technical support. Screen shots were also included. There was no excuse whatsoever for the Dell repair depot to have ignored them.\n\nIt took a few days for me to regain my cool, but as soon as I did, I call Dell technical support once again referencing the now growing list of service request numbers associated with this machine. As before, the Dell support person was courteous and professional. He could sense my patience was near its end with this PC and did his best to help.\n\nHis solution was to do a clean install (once again) of the OS. Although I was certain this would make no difference, I followed the instructions he walked me through to the letter, but to no avail. The next solution offered was another trip to the repair depot. My response was a polite but firm: \"NO!\"\n\nI went on to explain that this PC was less than two months old. Problems plagued it from almost the beginning. I had been patient, having done everything Dell support had suggested, yet found myself with a PC that still did not work as it was supposed to. I thanked the Dell support staff for all their professionalism, help and diligence. I was honest with them about my disappointment in the repair depot's efforts, to which they had no comment.\n\nI then asked the PC be replaced.\n\nI was transferred to another Dell representative. It was necessary to re-explain the entire history of the ailing PC. I was told of Dell's policy, under these circumstances, to provide a refurb unit as the replacement, which carried the same warranty as a new one. The arrangements were made. The replacement PC arrived about 5-6 days later, along with a pre-paid shipping label to return the original unit. The original PC was sent back to them.\n\nThe replacement PC was totally pristine, appearing to be and both packaged and labeled as if were a brand new PC, not a refurb. Of this I cannot be sure, but certainly am not complaining. The replacement PC works perfectly, with none of the problems I found in the original.\n\nWhy share this entire story? There is a lesson to be shared... Polite, patient and reasonable behavior can sometimes pay off. It's worth trying first, as you can always lose your temper later. However, it is the company you find yourself dealing with that often determines the path.\n\nDell makes great products. In spite of their best efforts to prevent it, occasionally a \"lemon\" rolls-off their assembly line. Making great products doesn't necessarily make them a great company. Greatness is demonstrated in how problems such mine and the occasional \"lemon\" are handled.\n\nDell did everything to try and help me with my \"lemon.\" They did more than they were required to do. Even so, when all their help failed, they still stood behind their product and replaced it with a peach!\n\nI could not be happier with the 2 in 1 and the company that not only made it, but stood behind it.\n\n+++ Update ++++\n\nOthers have asked for follow-up since my experience explained above, so here we go...\n\nI still have this PC and have since upgraded it to WIN 10, which seems better designed for this PC, as everything seems to work better than it did with WIN 8.2. I've grown to like this PC very much as I travel with it quite often and have had ZERO problems since receiving it as a replacement for the first defective one. I remain a loyal Dell customer."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF3M", "review": "Was really excited when first seeing this Dell Inspiron 11.6\" 2-in-1 notebook in a local showroom.  But reading many reviews online, it seemed to have a pretty high \"lemon\" rate--like problems with the trackpad erratic and keyboard sometimes stopping working, and occasional freezes and crashes. But some people loved it, and the design is unique and innovative with the flip screen in particular. Not only that, it appeared to be easily upgradable with an SSD and more memory if desired, and the display looked pretty good. So took the chance & grabbed one (a display model that i was able to personally use ahead of time, seemed solid with no apparent glitches).\n\nSo got it home and worked pretty well, and in all fairness audio (for a laptop) was outstanding, but the keyboard stopped working.  So i \"refreshed\" the machine which took an hour, and keyboard started working again.  So my newly-ordered Crucial M550 240gb SSD arrived, and after cloning the drive figured it'd be a cakewalk to swap it into the machine (especially since Dell provides instructions for getting into the innards thru the bottom).\n\nGuess again--no less than 9 screws had to be removed (some were loose), then hassled with plastic friction catches still holding the bottom in place (hoping not to break any of the thingys off). So finally successfully pried the bottom off.  Next, the spin 500g drive was held in with 3 more tiny superfluous screws (one would've done the job, but the fates were on my side--didn't lose any). Then the SATA connector to the hdd was not anchored to the mainboard--rather loosely held in place by a tethered wire, which made removal more risky than necessary.  All this apparatus was right next to a ribbon keyboard cable loosely connected to a plug--so loose it popped off when i removed the hdd (had no locking mechanism). The ribbon cable was run underneath the hdd, and folded diagonally over on itself to line up with the plug with no slack, so that operating temperature changes probably helped work the plug out of the socket over time. The connector has no hard plastic cover, which caused it to be the dickens getting it firmly seated in the socket without damaging it.\n\nAfter about 4x the estimated time to get this done, got the unit back together with newly-cloned SSD and ribbon cable staying loosely in the plug and all 12 screws reinstalled (miraculously without losing any).  Turning it on, bootup was faster but not spectacular, and overall performance was less than hoped for-- still slightly hesitant functioning. Compared to a Toshiba NB15T 11.6\" notebook (which is really a lesser machine in comparison which i also retrofitted an SSD), had a huge difference for the better in performance, and imho running side by side is smoother than the Dell.\n\nOne thing that had attracted me to the Dell was (in the showroom) a contrasty and overall attractive LED display. But after close side-by-side comparisons with my Toshiba, the difference wasn't striking. Both are 720p, but the colors, contrast and clarity don't hold a candle to what really is \"the standard\" in portable screens out there right now, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S with its 10 1/2\" Amoled display. Amoled just runs circles around typical run-of-the-mill LED displays, including Apple Retina (sorry apple fans). The Galaxy S's really really deep contrast and realism (and 1920p resolution)--just absolutely nothing else like it exists out there right now especially for movie viewing.\n\nSince after this experience the Dell's design did not inspire confidence, made the big decision and once again risked everything to put the Dell back into its original condition by removing my precious ssd, reinstalling the spin hdd, and back together without the keyboard cable slipping loose again, restored the OS to its factory state, in working order, ready for return.\n\nReally a shame, some really nice features in Dell's 2 in 1 notebook. But after getting a look inside, can see why there are lemon reports on this model ('tis a pity...)."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF3M", "review": "Intro: I am a graduate student in need of a computer I can carry in between my job, classes, and travel destinations. Due to the nature of my schedule. I was in need of a computer: 1) small enough I could store in my backpack/briefcase. 2) Light enough that it wouldn't feel uncomfortable to drag around like my 15.6\" Dell laptop. 3) Compact and versatile enough to open up on an airplane/train and get serious work done--sometimes requiring split screens with MS Office and hand drawing supply and demand graphs using touch input. 4) LOOONNG Battery life. 5) Lastly. I was in need of a computer study enough to withstand moderate the moderate abuse inflicted by a busy work-student-traveler lifestyle.\nInitial thoughts: I knew that Dell \"skimped\" a bit with the choice of components of this laptop. Certainty, the specs could be better... but I get it, Dell was trying to offer a good value for the price. I ended up choosing to buy this laptop over the Lenovo competitor because of its ability to be easily upgraded. I bought a Kingston 250Gb SSD with it, and I intend on buying an 8Gb RAM upgrade soon.\nOUT OF THE BOX: the mechanical 500 GB hard drive slows down the computer to the point of annoyance. I wasn't satisfied with a 20second boot speed. When running a browser, Office, Evernote, and Spotify expect a considerable amount of lag.\nUpgrade #1: Having a mechanical hard drive in a computer that is supposed to be a versatile 2-in-1 just doesn't make sense. There aren't many tablets out there that have mechanical hard drives. The moving, flipping, jerking, and tossing will eventually wear down the mechanical hard drive to the point of failure. I added the 250 GB SSD very easily by simply removing the back cover. Boot speed went down to 9 seconds. I experience no lag when running Chrome, Office, Evernote, and Spotify. The battery life went up significantly to an average of 8hrs. It's also worth mentioning that the laptop is completely silent at this point...\n\nThe rest of the laptop:\n\nKEYBOAD/MOUSE/ TOUCH INPUT: I see a lot of people have complained about the keyboard and trackpad. In my experience, the keyboard feels solid and doesn't exhibit much flex. The trackpad is less sturdy than the keyboard and is not very fun to click into. I also increased the palm rejection setting and it doesn't bother me when I'm typing/drawing on it. I experienced a faulty touchscreen from the start. When I flipped the hinges into \"tablet mode\" the touch screen would no longer work. I sent it back and got a replacement. The touch screen now works fine. Once again, you have to be ready to do a bit of trouble shooting with this computer.\nSOUND: amazing sound for the price. Every time I play music from Spotify my friends comment \"wow that's louder than my Mac.\"\n\nSCREEN/HDMI: vivid colors, great contrast rate, for an 11.6 inch screen, I am pleased. I always have the brightness all the way up and I don't experience any problems. HDMI can be a little funny to configure at once but I finally got it to adjust to my 22\" dell monitor.\n\nConclusion: buy it if you're competent with computer troubleshooting. The hardware may be faulty due to the lack of quality testing from Dell. I highly recommend upgrading the hard drive to an SSD if you're trying to get anything serious done. The battery life is very impressive. Overall I recommend this product despite the problems I had with it. I knew what I was getting myself into in the first place and that lowered my expectations enough to be willing to shape this device into \"my own.\" If you're up for a challenge, get it. I will offer an update in the following months describing the 8GB RAM upgrade.\n\n********UPDATE********  12/31/2014\nThank you for taking the time to read my review and leaving questions. I've had the laptop now for a couple of months and I wanted to give an update on my thoughts:\n\n1) My enhanced version of this laptop (SSD + 8Gb RAM) has completely replaced my larger more powerful Intel i7 15.6\" Laptop. My inspiron runs just about everything. Including Photoshop CS6 and Adobe Illustrator.\n\n2) The battery life took a hit with my heavy usage. I am now getting around 6.5hrs of battery life... But then again, that's still REALLY good.\n\n3) I recently bought a stylus to accompany this laptop. If you are considering buying one, I highly recommend you buy a stylus with magnets. The inspiron has four sets on magnets: Two near on either side of the trackpad and two above the upper edges of the monitor. When I am in class, I simply \"snap\" my stylus onto the screen. When I close my laptop I snap the stylus onto the outer edge of the trackpad. This may sound really geeky, but I have gotten many compliments on this simple feature at the time I am sitting in the middle of a meeting and I am able to draw figures on my screen like I would with a pen and pencil.\n\n4) Heat: when the laptop is in heavy usage, it gets hot. Not uncomfortably hot, though.\n\nFINAL thoughts: I have not had any problems with the laptop in the past three months of usage. I have been very surprised at the performance I am getting. I am going to raise this review to FIVE starts instead of my previous four star review. This laptop deserves more attention and it's a complete underdog in the market."}

It is so small and light that it is a lot more convenient for me to sit in corners and draw than my extra wide and bulky Toshiba computer.\n\nIf you are use to ultra fast computers, this computer will be kind of an adjustment for you, but you should know that by the specs.  I hear a lot of complaints about the keyboard popping up a lot and getting in the way, but I have not had that problem really. Biggest things to note are the face recognition is really terrible and by-passable and all it does is slow down start up. I've had a glitch when I fold over to tablet and back to laptop and the mouse freezes but everything else work, I understand this is probably because I have not been the nicest to this laptop.\n\nI've had this 2 in 1 for exactly 3 months and I'm happy overall, even though I use it for everything but what I intended to from the beginning."}

Actually, I love it!  The exterior case and build quality are high end.  I am amazed with the quality feel of the hinges as you flip the unit all the way open and closed.  The keyboard is just big enough for a grown man to use.  The screen is very sharp.  This is my first experience with Windows 8 (8.1 actually.)  I was a little apprehensive about this new OS, as I'd heard some negative reviews, and wasn't looking forward to learning a new OS.  Windows 8.1 is so ridiculously intuitive, I was up and running and using everything within a matter of minutes.  And speaking of getting up and running...boy does this thing start up quickly!  And I can certainly confirm what several other reviewers noted: the sound quality is surprisingly good.  Any down sides yet???  Well, I do wish it had a built in DVD drive.  But that would make it bigger, and I love the size.  And the track pad isn't the best.  It's not bad, but I have used much better.  But I've found that I am using the touch screen 90% of the time anyway, and forgetting about the track pad. Overall, this little computer has a high end build quality and feel, operates faster than my other machines, and works really well.  I am pleased."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF3M", "review": "I'm really enjoying the new rush of thin and light notebooks. I enjoy the 11 inch form, and it works great with the 2-in-1, anddells attempt was not too bad.\n\nThe design is decently eye catching, it's ultrabook thin, with all the usb ports, hdmi, sd slots you could need. This is the part that is kinda meh to me though. Firstly the shape of it is kind of odd. While the main computer portion is thin, the screen is almost as thick, which when closed, makes the laptop thicker than your average thin and light. The keyboard is decently design, but when you type it had a hollow cheap feeling that is hard to explain. The touchpad also just doesn't feel that great, the texture is cheap feeling and it works so-so. The hinge could be a little stronger; if you yank up the laptop, the screen will fall backwards. These aside, I feel like most of them are things you can look around for $450, they aren't deal breakers, I just wish dell would have made a few things like the keybaord and touchpad feel a bit less cheap.\n\nPerformance on this laptop is not bad. Websites load fast, league of legends plays well on low settings,  videos play fine. The largest slowdown to things are the hard drive though, I almost would have preferred the cheap emmc memory used in the tablets. If you installed a cheap ssd in this (which you can do, as well as upgrade the ram, which is great) this would fly a lot faster. The new bay trail processors do great in every day use. The one complaint I have on performance is the multi-touch trackpad does not work too well. When you're scrolling, it's really jittery, and unstable feeling. Sometimes the multitouch just doesn't even work at all either, it's kind of touchy.\n\nScreen - The screen isn't bad, viewing angles are decent, though not as good as other IPS screens. Color and brightness seem good enough for the casual user. Touch on the screen has worked flawlessly so far.\n\nBattery - I think your average day of web surfing, and work processing would net you around 6+ hours on this, a lighter usage without internet would be 8. This is one thing Dell did well with, the other notebooks with these low power pentium and celeron bay trail processors should be getting at least this much battery life but for some reason they don't I applaud them on this.\n\nOverall this isn't a bad buy. If Dell would have made it a little bit lighter, and a little less cheap feeling it would have been amazing. If you are looking for a cheap pc that is light and functional this will get things done for you .If you buy this and know what you're doing, I would recommend getting a 120gb ssd and replacing your hard drive with that (you could almost sell the drive for as much as one would cost) and this would be a much more mean machine."}

Every time it's moved, even slightly, it disables the touchpad (apparently because it thinks it's a tablet every time it's moved, which is silly for anyone using a laptop as it's meant to be used - on one's lap).  Along with disabling the touchpad, when it's moved the product also resets the volume to zero and forces you to reset it with different buttons depending whether it's in tablet mode or laptop mode.  An obnoxious black box for volume control (which doesn't even work) stays on the upper left corner of the screen almost constantly.  Once in a while the touchscreen functions also just don't work - you tap on the icon for the touchscreen keyboard and it appears just to disappear.  Also, Alt+Tab doesn't work properly.

The keyboard is smooth; the hinges are strong & hold in any position; the whole thing is big enough to work on yet small enough to be compact.  It is a little heavier than I'd prefer for reading my Kindle books, etc.,  but it'll suffice for when I'm not reading on my tablet.  I love the touch screen & am amazed how easily I am picking up Windows 8.1 (never used Windows beyond the Vista version).

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF3M", "review": "I needed a new laptop, but had never really given a tablet/laptop combo much thought.  I have a Kindle paperwhite that I use for reading, and didn't really think that I needed much more than just a new laptop.  I couldn't have been more wrong!\n\nI'm not going to focus on the technical aspects of the computer because it's all described in the product description from Dell.  Instead I'll just try to explain how it works for what I need.\n\nMy previous laptop was actually a netbook.  It was great for email and searching the web since it was small and lightweight.  What I didn't like about it was the battery life and that I couldn't use it for some of my high performance software like Photoshop.  The Dell Inspiron Convertible Touchscreen laptop is perfect for my needs.  I love that:\n\n*  It's still very lightweight and portable, but offers a larger screen\n*  It has a long lasting battery 6+ hours!\n*  I love love love the convertible aspect.  I didn't know if I would really use it like a tablet, but I use it way more as a tablet then I thought I would.  I have used it to watch movies (and the screen ratio is perfect for this function), search the web.\n*I love that you don't need a case to have it stand up (tent-like) like you do with an iPad or Kindle Fire.  I've used it for business trade shows to showcase products as it can stand on it's own.\n*It's as fast and responsive as I need it to be with all of the programs that I've run on it.  Including Photoshop which is a resource hog.\n\nThings that I don't love so much:\n\n* I'm not a huge fan of Windows 8.  That has been the biggest learning curve for me.  This has nothing to do really with the Dell laptop or it's performance.  Though I have learned that I can reach my desktop for a more Windows 7 experience from the home page.  After I created some short cuts on the desktop it resolved many of my Windows 8 hangups.  I still don't like that you are tied to a Microsoft account to download apps for Windows 8, but it's something I'm just going to have to learn to live with if you are going to have a product that uses Microsoft Windows.\n* I also don't like it for reading.  While the laptop itself is really lightweight (for a laptop), it's heavy for an e-reader.  And I didn't really like the Kindle app for reading.  It doesn't have the same options that an actual Kindle e-reader does.  Again this isn't really something at fault with the computer, but the app.  I still use my Kindle paperwhite to read with, and I'm perfectly OK with this.\n\nOverall, I was pleasantly surprised.  This laptop performed better than I had expected.  It's sleek, lightweight, and it does everything that I need it to do, plus some especially for the price.  I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a laptop, regardless of whether you think you want a convertible laptop or not.  I think you would be surprised at how much you will use it as a tablet.  I know I was."}

Their own literature says the operating system won't handle game playing. When you have a problem, Good Luck, there is no tech support in the US. India or the Philippines, take your pick.

And unless you can hold your hands completely motionless, in no time you will be typing in a foreign  language. And in addition, the keyboard is very small, and your hands hide the keys.

I purchased mine from Dell for 4 Benjamins, and financed it through a Dell Preferred Account for an additional 10% off. Beyond the form factor and price, I like the fact that the memory and storage on this machine can be user upgraded, whereas many other similar devices come with those components soldered on.\n\nI've upgraded the hard drive to a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Samsung-Electronics-840-EVO-Series-250GB-2-5-Inch-SATA-III-Single-Unit-Version-Internal-Solid-State-Drive-MZ-7TE250BW/dp/B00E3W1726/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Samsung Electronics 840 EVO-Series 250GB 2.5-Inch SATA III Single Unit Version Internal Solid State Drive MZ-7TE250BW</a>, and it made a significant difference in noise and performance. The only issue I encountered during the OS migration was the Samsung Data Migration software kept giving me a disk defrag error, which I was finally able to resolve by using Windows 8 disk manager to shrink the primary hard drive partition down to less than 250gb. The Samsung Data Migration software worked flawlessly after that. The Samsung Magician software is also excellent, and I recommend installing it. This laptop only supports SATA II, but from what I've researched the speed difference isn't noticeable for most users, and certainly isn't a bottleneck in this machine.\n\nI have not upgraded the memory at this time. I am waiting for prices on 8GB DDR3L memory modules to drop, and 4GB is currently sufficient for my needs as it isn't my primary workhorse computer.\n\nI also own an Asus T100, and below are the differences compared to the T100. A \"+\" denotes an attribute in the Dell's favor, and a \"-\" denotes an advantage to the T100:\n\nDell i3147-3750 vs Asus T100:\n\n+ larger screen size (11.6\" vs 10.1\", both at 1366x768 resolution)\n+ roomier keyboard that is much easier to type on\n+ more flexible screen (I wish I could tilt the T100 screen back another 15-30 degrees)\n+ more memory (and is user upgradable)\n+ more storage (and is user upgradable)\n+ much faster charging (T100 uses microUSB charger which is slow)\n+ faster CPU (Pentium N3530 vs ATOM Z3775 or the older Z3740)\n- shorter battery life (5-6 hours vs 8-10 hours)\n- heavier (especially in tablet form)\n- bulkier power supply and uses a 3-pronged power cord\n- worse build quality (Dell uses soft plastics and the finish scratches easily)\n- higher street price at time of this review\n\nAll in all, I really like the Dell. I only wish it had a backlit keyboard (but that would raise the price), or the F1-F12 keys were more visibly labeled (the small blue lettering is difficult to see in the dark).\n\nBelow are a couple of tips I've discovered that other users may find useful, particularly those that prefer a bluetooth mouse, as the built-in trackpad isn't all that great.\n\n* To prevent bluetooth devices (like mice) from disconnecting, see: http://i.imgur.com/Vtni7GY.png\n\n* To switch the functionality of the Function keys, see: http://i.imgur.com/ZxlFLtR.png"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF3M", "review": "After having this for a little over a week, I absolutely love this computer especially since the one I had previously had a VERY slow internet connection. This laptop does take a little bit to start up and the apps on the start menu takes a little bit to load, but the internet connection is not slow. The fact that this can also be a tablet is pretty awesome too.\nWhile other reviews said they had an issue with the touch pad after turning this laptop back into one from a tablet, I have to say I have not had that problem. There was one time that the touch screen was a little glitchy (kept acting like I was touching the screen even when I wasn't) so it prevented me from using the touch pad. I just closed it and then later restarted it and I haven't had a problem with it since. Another problem that I recently had was that when I turned it on, the screen remained black even though I could hear that it was running. After freaking out a bit, I held down the power button until the blue light faded out and the laptop turned off. I waited about 10-15 seconds and then I held the power button down again until I saw the dell logo on screen. What a relief! So if this happens to you, don't freak out. It will be ok.\nSo far, this laptop has worked better than I could have imagined. The glitches that occurred were only brief and haven't happened again. The glitches are the only reason I give this four stars. Also, I do have to agree with other reviewers about it heating up after it has been in tablet mode for awhile. However, after this happened, it seemed like it cooled down pretty quickly. Due to the fact this a pretty cool design for a laptop, it's at a good price, works really well, and hasn't really given me any grief, I would highly suggest this laptop.\nIf there are any more issues, I will be sure to edit this review."}

This laptop/tablet 2-in-1 works well out of the box but works even better when you upgrade the RAM to the 8 GB max and swap out the 500 GB mechanical hard drive to an SSD. The quad-core Intel Pentium processor is quick.  Unless you are gaming or using CPU hogging applications the processor performs most tasks smoothly. The touch-screen is very responsive. If you are a digital comic book fan you will be happy using this as a tablet to read your books. The battery life as advertised is between 7 and 8 hours (I am using an SSD).\n\nA note to people looking to upgrade the RAM and hard drive to SSD. Make sure when looking at RAM you purchase a stick that is low voltage v1.35. Secondly, do not attempt to clone the drive and replace this will not work. The best procedure is to use a USB drive or CD's if you have an external burner and create restore disks. Install the SSD drive and use the restore disks to install the OS. You should run in to less issues using this method.\n\nI was expecting a high volume of bloatware on this machine but Dell has really kept the amount low. Besides a few Dall applications and McAfee there wasn't much else that needed to be removed. McAfee can be a pain to remove, I recommend reading online tutorials on proper removal.\n\nI highly recommend this and am happy with my purchase."}

I love this laptop, so that makes switching Windows versions much easier.\nThere are may positives about this machine, but I think the two things I like the most are the size and the responsiveness.  The keyboard is a breeze to type on, and the touch screen makes it easy to move around the page.\nThere are two things which Dell could have make a little better.  The first is that the power converter is normal sized, which cuts down on the portability of the unit as a whole.  The other thing is the track pad / mouse pad.  It's a little larger than needed and doesn't have a good feeling texture.  It also doesn't have an easy touch and scroll functionality which my older Toshiba has.

The laptop is far, far thinner and better looking than absolutely anything Dell has ever come out with before, I can promise you that. I've owned an older version inspiron for years (that weighed way too much) and worked with many latitudes and ultraportable XPS machines, and I can tell you this laptop far and away looks better than any of those. Only negative thing I can is that the black bezel around the screen is a bit wide (maybe an inch all the way around) so the touchscreen is definitely not edge-to-edge by any means but I can understand the utility of that if you're using it in tablet mode (which I never do). Other than that it honestly looks (design-wise) like a >$1000 machine easily.\n\nThe hinges are also much stronger than I would have thought. Again I've had this for over a month and I use it very frequently, and I've maybe once ever actually moved the screen around to be in tablet or stand mode (never really tried working in tent mode). But I can tell the hinges are better than I expected them to be in the sense that they are strong and won't give too much when you're pressing on the screen when it's in regular laptop mode. But again only 1 month so far, time will tell.\n\nThe pentium processor isn't the fastest thing in the world but I went for years with a first general intel core duo 1.6 GHz in my old inspiron and it worked just fine for me, so this is definitely an improvement. I use it a lot to write documents in MS Word or look up my patients in the remote medical record system (Epic) usually on one side of the screen while I have a netflix tv show or something running on the other side of the screen (I like the side-by-side thing), which incidentally is perfectly fine on this 11-inch screen. I had some concerns that the screen might be too small for me but honestly it's perfectly fine (although I'm 26 so my eyesight isn't that bad yet). But the fact that it's a touch screen makes life so much easier. Instead of scrambling for the cursor with the touchpad sometimes I just reach out and touch whatever box or icon I want to click, huge time saver.\n\nAll in all: this is actually a very high quality machine, and even more so when you look at the price. I would much rather own this than a macbook air which I was also considering (before I remembered that I hate Mac OS), and besides I could break this and buy two new ones before I would approach the cost of a macbook air (which just doesn't make sense to me for my uses)."}

I didn't need the added bonus of the flip-over/tablet feature, but I thought it was nice design and maybe Id use that too.\n\nThen, after receiving it earlier today, I spent several hours using it.  And Im sad to say that the more Ive used it, the less I like it.  So tomorrow Ill be boxing it up and returning it.\n\nThe two big problems I found were a glitchy mouse pad and an underpowered CPU.\n\nThe problem with the mouse pad is scrolling.  It isn't always responsive.  Sometimes  especially when the computer is doing something, it will hang and ignore your finger movements.  Also, even when it is responsive, it still does not allow for one finger edge scrolling.  By design, it requires two fingers to scroll  and has no edge scrolling option.\n\nThe other deal-breaker is the underpowered CPU.  When the computer is downloading large files or programs  it will not allow you to efficiently work in the background.  Instead, it will hang and freeze intermittently if you try to do anything (even web surfing) while its downloading larger files.  Thats probably not going to be an issue for most people  since they don't download larger files regularly.  But for me, it is a great inconvenience and Id rather keep the old clunker I have now, than live with that problem.\n\nNow if all you plan to do is surf the web, check email and stream videos you will probably be very happy with this device.  Its perfect for those things.  But if you plan to use it for professional work  and you need to remain productive  then Id recommend you keep shopping . . ."}

Initialize the SSD as GUID Partition Table (GPT) vs Master Boot Record (MBR) and format as simple volume:\na. Use \"Run Command\" and type \"diskpart\"\nb. Identify the drive to reformat: type \"list disk\"\nc. Select the drive, and reformat it: type \"select disk <disk number>\"\nd. Type \"Clean\"\ne. Type \"convert gpt\"\nf. Type \"exit\"\n\n2. Set BIOS to UEFI boot in unsecured mode.\n\n3. Used Win 8.1 media for a clean install (when choosing the installation type, select \"Custom\" the drive should appear as a single area of unallocated space.\nSelect the unallocated space and click \"Next\" Windows begins the installation).\n\n4. Load Win 8.1 drivers from Dell Support site (preferably on a SDHC card from another system since Wi-Fi will not operate on system without driver; another alternative is to access internet via an Ethernet/USB dongle).\n\nNote: Dell Inspiron i3147-3750sLV system BIOS does not incorporate Trusted Platform Module (TPM), however, you can encrypt the Samsung SSD by upgrading to Win 8.1 Pro and enabled BitLocker (see allow BitLocker without a compatible TPM link: http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/6229/how-to-use-bitlocker-on-drives-without-tpm/)"}

I like the dual functionality of the Inspiron 2 in 1 - I switch back and forth between tablet and laptop mode constantly. When I need to do serious work I hook it up to a keyboard, mouse and 24 inch monitor.  Windows 8 takes some getting used to and the touch pad is kind of funky so I use the touchscreen most of the time. I opted for the Pentium Quad processor and it was worth the extra money."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF3M", "review": "Bad on so many levels.. For one, the form factor is very cheap, and prone to issues. Such as the trackpad not pushing properly. Second, the trackpad itself is hideous, even with adjustments it feels like a cheap paint job over some cheap plastic.\n\nThe brightness/color are off on the screen, and the screen itself presents an image of a cheap, low end Chinese screen you find on $50 tablets. No SSD, and a slow 5400RPM drive. Not good. Loaded to the max with bloatware. McAffee junk product, Dell nonsense, so much so you will literally need to reformat this to make it reasonably usable. Overall this is pretty bad, and I do not know why anyone would settle for this.\n\nEDIT: I wanted to expand this review to include what I believe are the best alternatives. Currently, Lenovo Thinkpad Twist is the absolute best 2 in 1. Sadly they just stopped making them. After hearing this news I purchased a second new-in-box Thinkpad Twist so I would have a nice new one to years for a few years. The twist is lightyears better than this, and costs only $100-$150 more in most cases. So since this particular 2 in 1 is horrible, where does that leave you with choices?\n\n1) Surface - the previous Surfaces were lousy for so many reasons I don't even want to list them. The new 3 is much better, but still limited as it doesn't function well with non-metro stuff, and has limited use with the flimsy keyboard. They are also overpriced.\n\n2) Dell Inspiron 2 in 1 Convertibles. These seem ideal, but the form factor is terrible, they have the quality of a $50.00 tablet from China. They toss 5400RPM drives in these, and massive bloatware. Then they increase battery life by crippling the features, and beauty of it. Overpriced for what you get. But the two worst aspects are when you go into tablet mode the keyboard is exposed on the back - although disabled, it feels terrible. The second thing is the onscreen keyboard 'rarely' fires off correctly. Overall these are terrible.\n\n3) Dell XPS Carbon Flips. These look great, have nice flip screens, but suffer from poor reliability. They often overheat, then the chips 'fail' on them. Microcenter employees told me they replace the display model one every week, as it mysteriously dies every few days. Reading online, this seems to be the issue. Once again Dell lacks quality control. These are also expensive, and if reliability isn't going along with that price, who wants them?\n\n4) Asus. I do not buy Asus anything. They have hideous quality control. 10-15 years ago Asus was good. Their motherboards were nice, their graphic cards worked. But anyone with any knowledge of components and systems probably avoids Asus these days. So that basically removes anything Asus from contention.\n\nSo that leaves me back to Lenovo.. I don't like the Yoga, which once again moves the keyboard to the back after disabling it. The only viable one is the 'great' Lenovo Twist, which again they are no longer making but overall is the best 2 in 1 device out there, and I have tried almost all of them at this point. A good 2 in 1 should function like a 'great' tablet, and a 'great' notebook without any compromises of either. Twist has Gorilla Glass screens, few companies use those on 2 in 1's. Twist has robust hardware, with a small SSD for Windows, and a larger drive for files, the best of both worlds. Lenovos have a strong battery, run cool, and the twist feature is far more than a gimmick, it WORKS."}

I spent close to two hours working with Dell Support (they've always been great to work with)and net/net - - you cannot get the resolutions to work properly on a monitor or HDTV (16 X 9).  This renders the HDMI \"out\" useless.  DO NOT expect this to work with a monitor or HDTV for movies.  The resolutions are not accurate - - 1920 X 1080 is oversized on a standard 16 X 9 HDTV. Sure, you'll get a picture but it's off - - way off.  And that's unfortunate.  Works great as a vacation PC - - do not try to substitute as a Travel/Work PC.  If you cannot connect properly to a monitor - - what's the point?  Too bad - - loved the plane ride to CA and being able to see full screen TV on DISH on Southwest Airlines.  (Android does not work).\n\n***UPDATE 08.30.14 - Just swapped out the hard drive to a 500 GB SSD Samsung 840 EVO drive.  Also purchased the Inateck USB 3.0 2.5 Portable HDD Enclosure from Amazon as well.  Blazing fast speed!  Well worth it.\n\nIf you are considering upgrading this tablet/laptop - - it can be done.  My recommendation is to read the manual from the Dell website and follow the instructions.  The Samsung migration software is also very easy to use.  I'd suggest matching drive size - - 500 GB.  You can go smaller, but for the extra $$$ - - it provides that same storage capability but much, much faster.  And it wasn't that slow to begin with! ***\n\nI purchased this from Micro Center as an open box unit for $340.00.  It will be used as a \"Travel PC\" - so I needed a strong Windows laptop that was portable and easy to use.  It comes installed with McAfee - - and I had problems getting rid of it (Windows Defender works much better!)  The Dell service is fantastic and you need to run the McAfee software to completely get rid of it.  Much faster without McAfee and it's harassing messages.\n\nI read the problems reported about the trackpad.  I was surprised - - it's worked fine for me.  The keyboard is a little tight but very functional.  You can type fast and it isn't a problem.\n\nI upgraded the memory to 8 GB.  I was going to install an SSD but the speed is surprisingly fast - - so I will wait on that.\n\nScreen is gorgeous and this is a very portable unit.  Sound is super - - especially for movies.  I'll use it in tablet mode for movies when I fly on business with ear buds.  Otherwise, the speakers sound better in the \"PC\" mode.  It does run a little hot but not a deal breaker.  Battery life is 5 to 5 1/2 hours - - I keep the screen pretty bright.\n\nSo far, so good.  Nice and compact.  I do not know of anything on the market that provides the versatility of a tablet and the usability as a laptop compared to this unit.  This means one less device to carry on planes and that is a huge benefit."}

I was hesitant after reading the display resolution specs but the display is great, the colors vibrant, responsiveness quick and it's bright enough to work on outside. I was also assuming I would have to upgrade the RAM or get an SSD for decent speed. But so far so god, as is. I keep numerous windows open and don't feel any great performance issues at all. Boot up is also surprisingly fast. Great to be able to use my Windows programs, the wireless works great, it's great as a tablet and as an entertainment unit. The sounds coming out of the speakers is pretty amazing better than my W520. The only thing I felt I needed to buy so far is a USB-ethernet adapter to directly connect to the internet. That cost me $15 on eBay. Finally the keyboard is fantastic. Not crunched up like the Asus transformer which I was also considering. Very highly recommended.

Large enough to see the screen and my projects clearly, small enough to fit comfortably on my lap while lounging on the couch.\n-The convertible aspect is WONDERFUL. I love the rotating design of the screen. Because the screen always stays attached to the keyboard, it always feels very stable.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF3M", "review": "This laptop is an amazing value. As soon as you remove it from the box, you can tell that build quality is superb, especially for this price point. The shell appears to be some lightweight metal alloy, thought it may be some plastic-metal concoction. At any rate, it feels durable and strong. I have owned much more expensive Dells in the past that have felt much cheaper in their construction. For this particular computer I was worried about the integrity of the hinges, as I plan to use it in all positions and switch between them frequently, but after a few weeks they still inspire confidence (the hinges themselves are made of an even sturdier metal).\n\nThis laptop is reasonably fast for everyday uses and feels very smooth for some more advanced graphical consumption (I use it to read 100MB+ graphics-heavy PDFs, and it looks brilliant). I upgraded from the Acer C720 Chromebook, a brilliant little machine in its own right, but I wanted a more fully-functional machine. The Chromebook was a bit faster for web browsing, but only slightly and of course they can't by design do much else.\n\nIt comes with Windows 8.1, which is a bit of an adjustment from Windows 7, but take a deep breath and get through the transition period. I have to admit that after 3+ years of using Windows 7, I was pretty stressed in my first few days with Windows 8.1, but after a week of trial and error, and looking up a few things, I feel at home again. I don't want to belabor my impressions of Windows 8, since almost all PCs come with Windows 8 now, but I will mention that this computer ships with the most recent updates (as of August 2014), which limits the amount of online updating that has to be done on first bootup.\n\nFor me, mobility and flexibility were keys to purchasing this laptop. This is an around-the-house laptop, capable of doing all of my day-to-day computing tasks, mostly consumption of reading material online or in images, movies, PDFs etc. It handles these tasks brilliantly, and the ability to flip the screen into tablet mode is wonderful for reading and general consumption. For distracted web browsing I still prefer to use a keyboard, but if I know I'm going to spend 20 minutes all on the New York Times website reading articles, I will use it in tablet mode.\n\nIt gets a little bit warm, but only noticeably so when watching video or playing games. The vent is at the joint between base and screen, which points away from the user in laptop mode, and can be oriented to face away in tablet mode as well (as you can flip the screen in any direction in tablet mode and your content will rotate automatically). The keyboard takes a little getting used to, but this is the case with any keyboard. This review is the most I've typed on it in one go, and I'm finding that my fingers have adjusted nicely. They keys have a good resistance even for a low profile keyboard, and they don't get in the way when the laptop is flipped into tablet mode. The battery life is great. I haven't used it past halfway (and to ensure the longevity of modern day Lithium-Ion batteries, you shouldn't), and I get about 3 hrs on a 50% charge. (extrapolate to 6 hrs on a full charge, but again you really shouldn't fully drain a LI battery, which I know is counter to what you were told a decade ago about batteries, but the composition of batteries has changed since then).\n\nThe last key to mobility would be installing a solid state drive. At first I thought I would do this immediately because I couldn't bear the thought of going back to a spinning drive. But actually, after using it for a while, I hardly notice it. I will still probably upgrade eventually, but maybe once the Dell warranty has expired (12-15 months, depending on where you read).

I have been using a 15 inch Lenovo laptop windows 7 for a few years,  which weighs 6lbs with much faster processor i5.  Yet I have had some wifi issues over the last year with lenovo and had read about wifi issues with the Yoga.  I thought the Dell XPS 12 might be the answer but it was $300 more than this Dell Inspiron 2 in 1 and  had 128SD and the flip spin screen was a little awkward.  When I saw this for $399 with 500gig, I pulled the trigger.  I liked the idea of being able to use in tablet mode when traveling or when on my sofa at home.  Finally, I wanted to try out Windows 8 (actually this comes with 8.1).  In the two days, I can say it has maintained good wifi connection and has been plenty fast for my needs (surfing the web and watching some videos, e mail...).  The only con so far is that when I folded it back to tablet mode, I noticed it was getting pretty warm but I also had plugged in the charger.  I will have to see how it goes from here.  One other slight issue is that the font is small when I type (this review for example) but perhaps that can be adjusted, unless this is just a function of using a 11.6 screen.  I had thought about a 13 inch screen but the HP one I looked at with detachable tablet was too bulky for my travel needs.

I like to use it as a tablet  but I don't want to detach it from the keyboard, because you never know when you are going to want to flip it around to type anything longer than a couple sentences.  This computer is very thin, elegant looking, like a higher end ultrabook from last year or the year before.  The keyboard feels high quality.  The battery lasts at least 6-7 hours.  It is not the fastest laptop out there but at 2.3 ghz it's respectable.  It only has 4 g of RAM but the machine itself tells me that the max is 8.  You can buy a single stick 8 gig of DDR3 RAM here on Amazon for 72 bucks, which gives this little machine the power of a 1000 dollar laptop.  For another 105 dollars you can throw in a 256 gig SSD harddrive and then you have a computer in competition with $1400  laptops, other than lacking an I-series processor.  I plan to do both of these modifications.  I also like that the battery is easily user-replaceable.  I think the screen is not as precise with touch sensitivity as it could be if it was a Samsung or Apple device, but that's my only minor complaint.  The USB  3.0 and HDMI ports are nice to have---these are not standard on all laptops in this price range.  All in all I don't think there is anything better around right now for even 100-200 dollars more.  It doesn't hurt that this is a sleek and elegant looking computer, as well."}

This is my first hybrid touch pad/laptop, alternative to my larger laptop, it is light weight allowing me to carry to class or any where, and to type this review, lol.  For the HD--don't expect super speed like the steady state HD."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF3M", "review": "Just got this laptop today and so far I am very satisfied. It does exactly what I bought it for: Office, netflix, youtube, notes, pandora, skype etc without any issues. I wouldn't call it blazing fast, but it seldom lags in doing any of these tasks, or several of them at a time. I didn't think I would enjoy the rough trackppad, but it feels perfectly fine and the keyboard is very easy to type on, even though I have fairly large hands. The speakers sound pretty good and I haven't had to turn them past 50%, so they are pretty loud too. Lets not forget the screen though. Don't let the low resolution fool you. This laptop has an excellent screen. It has vivid colors, clear images, and is very nice looking. I've seen $600 laptops with screens worse than this one.\n\nI do have a few minor complaints though. When in any mode except \"Laptop\" or \"Tablet\" the volume and power buttons are difficult to use. Also, the touchpad did temporarily stop working. Flipping the screen and letting it re-orientate fixed the problem though. The battery life is a little less than expected too. I've seen several claiming 7-9 hours, but I've only got 5-6. Not bad, but less than I expected.\n\nOverall, very much worth the $400 I spent on it."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF3M", "review": "I bought this laptop for school and watching videos/browsing the web. I have a larger 17\" laptop that I use for gaming and such. I must say, I love this laptop. I've never really been a fan of Dell in the past, but I gave them another chance with this Inspiron. I'm quite impressed.\n\nThis is my first computer with Windows 8. I've heard a LOT of negative reviews on Windows 8, but I must say, its not as bad as others claim. Its nowhere near perfect. And I would never like Windows 8 without a touchscreen computer. Seems as if Windows 8 was MADE for touchscreen computers.\n\nPros:\nGreat display. Vivid colors and very clear.\nGood speaker quality. Much better than I expected.\nVery solid build.\nGreat keyboard.\nTouchscreen is very responsive.\nSwitching it over to \"tablet mode\" is very fast. Even though the keyboard is on the back, it doesn't feel as awkward as one might expect.\n\nCons:\nTouchpad is not very great.  I find myself resorting to a wireless mouse or using the touch screen most of the time.\nThe silver finish seems very cheap. Been using the laptop for a couple of days, and its already scratched at multiple locations.\n\nAll in all, its a great laptop for the price. I got this for $399 + a $50 rebate. Would definitely recommend this laptop to anyone."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF3M", "review": "Surprisingly well-executed computer.  I expected a thousand minor irritants typical of cheap Windows systems (none of which seem to affect Apple's portables), e.g. unusable touchpad, lousy battery life, loud fans and/or heat, derriere-loads of crapware, palm rest covered in cheesy stickers.  Instead this thing, despite its low cost, seems to have struck a fine balance.  It's fairly well-made (despite all the plastic), the touchpad is decent-to-good, battery life is excellent, and the greatest surprise has been the audio: great sound in headphones, and even the little speakers aren't bad.  It's very usable as a tablet, and I appreciate the touch screen.\n\nHowever, it's not fast or anything.\n\nPROS:\n- Audio subsystem!\n- Battery life.\n- Fanless: no noise, doesn't get very hot.\n- Usable keyboard and trackpad.\n- Light and portable, and seems robust-ish.\n- Touchscreen and hinge work great.\n- Usable as a tablet.\n- Microsoft no longer seems to force its sticker on the front.  A revolution.  If only Intel would adjust.\n\nCONS:\n- All plastic.  But at least it's not shiny, so it doesn't look like hell after a few hours of being manhandled.\n- Screen is pretty reflective.\n- Slow CPU, and the HDD feels slow too, especially coming from a machine with an SSD.\n- Still some bloatware.\n- Intel's sticker still a drag to remove.\n- Though in principle it's expandable, the process doesn't seem friendly."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF3M", "review": "I have only had this for 2 days, and I love it. Great alternative to the Surface. I did copy the HD to a SSD before I even booted to Windows for the first time, compared to the display model I played with at a big box store, it is way faster. So far I have not experienced any of the mouse, or auto-rotate lag that other reviewers have discussed, maybe because I uninstalled all the bloatware and other unnecessary apps that run in the background. I have it running MS Office 2010, and other software that I use daily, and no issues. my only complaint would be that the screen is not Full HD."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF3M", "review": "If all you want is a laptop then this one might be too small for you.  And if you want a table then this one might be too large and heavy for you.  But as a combo laptop/tablet it rocks!  I like the metallic finish that makes it look more expensive than it is.  The device boots up and shuts down very quickly.  The keyboard has the feel of a full-sized keyboard and (unlike some others) I haven't experienced problems with the touchpad.  The touch screen is very responsive, the display is great with very vivid colors and the sound is good too.  But the best thing is the ability to flip the keyboard around for four modes of use:  standard laptop, standard tablet, stand mode or tent mode.  I expected it to be awkward with the keyboard underneath in tablet mode but the keys are deactivated in that mode and the keyboard itself is flat enough that it's not an issue.  This is not for everyday tablet use as it's a bit heavier than a pure tablet but of course with greater functionality, a built-in keyboard and use as a full (touchscreen) laptop too.  I recommend this Dell Inspiron as a very versatile device that meets so many needs."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF3M", "review": "This laptop is pretty good, especially for the price. I'm glad Intel changed the name from Atom to Pentium because of the previous stigma attached to the slow Atom CPUs. The CPU in this one is now an out-of-order design and has competent graphics. The one thing I did do is upgrade to an SSD. This REALLY makes the thing feel much faster. Battery life is phenomenal as well. There are a few little issues. The keyboard is a little 'flexy' when typing, but not unusable by any means. The touchpad will sometimes just not work. I've found that this is the keyboard and touchpad locking software for when the screen is flipped. If you flip the screen over and back, it will fix the touch pad. I've also disabled the built in Synaptics gestures and installed 2-finger-scroll. Its much better and more consistent than the Synaptics control panel. I'm thinking of upgrading to 8GB of RAM, but haven't yet decided as I haven't had any slow down with the workload I put on the machine. Overall, its pretty good, not great. If the touchpad could be fixed, I'd give it 5 stars for sure.\n\nAs a side note, if Dell offered one of these with a Haswell i3 for $100-150 more, I'd plunk that down without hesitation. I'm not looking for an i7 quadcore or anything, but just not a 'budget' machine. However, until laptop OEMs realize that small doesn't need to be low end or ultra high end, I'll be fine with this one."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF3M", "review": "Very nice design and display. Had a good keyboard and touchscreen. I originally bought it hoping it would be an alternative to a rather large HP laptop I had. After a couple years of hauling around a 15\" laptop that constantly needed charging, I was ready for a smaller and better laptop.\n\nOverall, I think I liked this. It was quite heavy, though, for an 11\" (almost as heavy as my 15\") and that was a deal-breaker for me. I also personally think that 11\" is too small for me (so I've gone with Apple's MacBook Air 13\", which I bought a couple years later).\n\nIt also came with Windows 10 preloaded, which would normally be a positive, but my school had this issue where Windows laptops that already had Windows 10 on them (rather than Windows 8 and were later updated) couldn't connect to its wifi. The computer person at the school had to help me and code it so that it connected, but then that meant it couldn't connect to any other wifi connections. However, this was just an issue on my school's network, which has been fixed as far as I know. Since this is such a specific issue to a specific place, I don't really hold this against the product. The only real downside is the weight and size, but that's just me. I returned it for all these reasons. As mentioned earlier, I eventually went with the MacBook Air 13\" because of the light weight, good screen size, and compatibility with my school's network.\n\nBut if you're looking for a good quality laptop with a touch screen and beautiful display that won't break the bank, and light weight isn't a top priority, then this is a good choice."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF3M", "review": "There is barely enough processing power to support its own operating system. From day 1 it was incredible slow and had a ton of lag. Its primary use was for school work (word, excel, PowerPoint) and it was the most painful process each time. That being said, there was no game use, no video streaming, and no really demanding programs.\n\nIt looks sharp and appears to have good components, but don't be fooled. This computer is a frustrating waste of time.\n\n**Additionally, the hard drive failed on day 8 of month 13 and the computer became inoperable. There is a 12 month warranty, with a couple of day grace period. Dell informed me that my only option was to pay for shipping and pay for replacement plus labor of parts (about $150).\n\nBefore this experience, I used dell exclusively for my business computers. Now I refuse to buy them again. Needing dozens of computers every 2 years, is not enough for them to do the right thing with one laptop that I purchased for personal use."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF3M", "review": "I've had a few laptops over the years, and this one has been the worst. Here are some highlights:\n\nInaccurate touchscreen - The resolution of the touch screen is terrible. I cannot use it in tablet mode because it's so difficult to use the touch function.\n\nWeak hinges - Within a year, the right hinge was broken. Inside each hinge is a series of small precision gears, riding on very small axles. The axle bent, binding up the gears, which locked my laptop open. Very difficult to use a laptop when you can't change the angle of the screen. I had to cut open the hinge and remove the gears. Now the screen opens crooked.\n\nAbysmal performance - too slow to run much more than word and chrome. Don't try to use this for any games beyond minesweeper.\n\nSlow startup - very difficult to get the laptop to hibernate instead of shut down. The power settings are useless, as the computer will completely shut down whenever I shut the lid. Touching the touch pad and pressing keys won't wake it up. A majority of the time, neither will pressing the power button! Any 75% of the time, I need to hold down the power button to give it a \"hard reboot\". When it does wake up, it takes about 4 minutes before I can perform simple tasks like open Chrome or My Computer.\n\nAnnoying bloatware - every time I turn it on, it asks me if I'd like to enable facial recognition. No way to disable the message. And when I do try to enable it, it's useless. Doesn't recognize my face, and I can't find any purpose or use for it. Constant pop ups letting me know my TouchPad had been disabled (it hasn't) or auto-rotate has been enabled (still sitting horizontal on my lap). No rhyme nor reason for most of them.\n\nEase of use - due to the reasons above, and a few other minor annoyances, I have ended up just using it a very large, very expensive SD Card reader. Everything else, from browsing the net to sending emails to organizing photos, is more quickly and easily done on my phone. I feel like it was a waste of my time and money. Please don't make the same mistake I did. Keep looking for a different laptop."}
