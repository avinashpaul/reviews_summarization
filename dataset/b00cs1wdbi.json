He loves our iPad and we wanted him to have a tablet all his own with much more controlled access to the Internet. First...I had NO IDEA the apps/games would be so expensive!! It's much cheaper for me to buy the cartridges on Amazon than to download them directly to this device. It's makes no sense to me as there are no material, packaging or shipping costs! It also has no capability for the parent to decide which child gets a certain app under their user profile. Sometimes you may want a certain app for both and sometimes you may not. Depends on the age or gender difference of your children. I thought access to the Internet would be much more broad but allow the parent to control accessible content. Seriously debating returning this device before anymore content is downloaded. ;("}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "We received this tablet yesterday and set it up. For some reason when we click on the calendar app, the date is set to the wrong one. I am not sure how to fix it, and contacted Leap Frog with no help. Also, the product has dead pixels on the screen. It is a little slow, but I didn't expect it to be super fast. We tried out the NABI 2 before, and the one we had was always freezing, slow, and glitchy. This Ultra was actually better in that aspect with our experience. Besides the data problem and dead pixels, I think that the screen is nice, it feels nice and durable, and has nice content. I was already aware that the apps cost more than if we had an ipad or kindle going into this purchase so that situation doesn't bother me much.\n\nEDIT ***I forgot to add that the \"pink\" option we chose is really more purple like our tag reader than in these pictures.\n\nEDIT 2 *** Amazon sent us a replacement for our dead pixel leap pad ultra. The new one is slower than the first one. I keep wanting to give it the benefit of the doubt, but new problems just keep occurring. Instead of being able to edit your profile by clicking your name at the top of the home screen like it prompts you to do numerous times it always goes back to the sign in screen. This didn't happen on the first ultra we had yesterday. Also we purchased 3 apps from the app center and 1 wouldn't download. Finally the tech support was able to fix it, I am so happy they responded fast about it. I am hoping that we can fix the edit profile problem and that once these bugs are worked out I will love the tablet even more!"}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "I am writing the review I wish I had read before purchasing the Ultra.  I did research on it before purchase, but I could never physically touch one before ordering the \"next great thing from LeapFrog\".\n\nI expected great things considering how much family members had raved about their LP2's.  The platform of games/web browsing and ebooks sounded great.\n\nWe got ours and set it up/tried it out before giving it to our 3 year old.  It takes 10 - 15 seconds for it just to turn on AND for apps to load.  I got bored, I can't imagine what a 3 year old would do.  It also has trouble recognizing when it is turned from landscape to portrait and gets stuck and unresponsive and needs to be restarted with the main power button.\n\nI have had it freeze on me at least 6 times and needed to restart it.\n\nEmails and calls to customer service as well as a FirmWare update have all proven futile so far.\n\nApps are VERY expensive -- up to $25 and not that much more impressive than some of the apps I have bought on my iPad for $3.  The ebook selection for the Ultra is very limited at the moment; the books available for the LP2 are not necessarily available yet for the Ultra.\n\nWe will be keeping our daughter ignorant that we ever even had this device in the house and, unfortunately since we cannot return it now that it has been opened, will look to give it to someone who may not mind the clunkiness of it."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "We have had our Ultra for a few days now.  We also had the LeapPad and the LeapPad 2.  We decided we needed to upgrade for the bigger screen and wifi.  There is so much we love about the Ultra!  The screen is HUGE.  The size of an ipad mini screen.\n\nThe Ultra is built TOUGH.  Its heavier than the LeapPad 2, but that is to be expected due to its large size. It comes with a built in battery, no need to purchase batteries or a battery pack on this device.  The Ultra comes with a charger for at home, and a USB cable.  You can also purchase a car charger for this device.\n\nMy favorite upgraded features are the 7 inch screen, the kid safe LeapSearch which allows your child to surf content that Leapfrog has deemed safe.  There are categories of video's and websites like NickJr.com, PBS kids, Barbie, ThinkQuest, Highlights Kids, Funology, NASA, and many more!  I also love that there is an upgraded Pet Pad Party app which allows you to pick from a wide variety of pets, design them, design their home, play tick tack toe and all sorts of fun things!  My daughter really enjoys that feature.  For those who have 2 children who will have Ultras there are peer to peer features where your children can play against each other (or any other Ultra user in the same room).  Games like Cart Racing and Roly Poly World, but you can select the learning level for each child so the questions will be geared for that child while they are playing on their device!\n\nAnother great feature on the device is a APP CENTER APP, where you can purchase and download apps right from the device.  You can only do this is parent mode of course, and you have to enter a code that you choose to purchase an app.  I love that you can also purchase apps from the app center at Leapfrog.com, or from Leapfrog Connect on your computer and once the Ultra is turned on it will start downloading your purchases with no need to connect via USB.  I really like the fact that the stylus is pushed into the side of the device, and that the volume buttons are at the top, and the power button is on the side.  The only buttons on the front are the d-pad and home buttons.  I have noticed that with the Ultra you can use the d-pad in games where you normally tilt the device to move objects or characters.  I'm not sure if that was a possibility in the previous LeapPad devices? Its great to have the option.\n\nI highly recommend this device. Its perfect, safe, fun, big screen, wifi included, tough, will grow with your child, and Leapfrogs educational content can't be beat.  We have tried Vtech products, and we own a Kindle Fire and Ipad, but my daughter still chooses her LeapPad to play with. I love that I don't have to worry about anything she is looking at or playing with, and I know that she is LEARNING from content designed by education professionals.  I have never found the quality of content anywhere else, that LeapFrog offers.  Ipad apps may be cheaper, or free, but the content is just not there.  You get what you pay for with Leapfrog, they stand behind their products.  I don't mind the cost to ensure that my child is learning as we use our device for educational entertainment.\n\nIf you are looking at buying your child a learning tablet, this one simply can't be beat.  We are thrilled with it.  I'd suggest not waiting to long to purchase if you are thinking of this being a Christmas gift. Its sure to be a sell out!!\n\nThank you for another great product Leapfrog!"}

The original one has by far lasted the longest. We bought the ultra for our daughter just wanting to upgrade because she's had the other one for so long. The 3 has been good too except for the stylus tip. I can deal with that. The ultra was used for a month, and the screen cracked. When turned on, more than half the screen is black and distorted. I can't find a replacement screen to get it fixed. And on the leapfrog website, it says it is not covered by warranty. Now I have this product that can't even be played with. Very disappointed with this one."}

You can't download PBS kids, Netflix, or any other software like that like you can on a Kindle or iPad. There apps are really expensive and even on Wifi it's the slowest device I have EVER used. Like makes me crazy slow when I'm trying to add new apps. The only positive it has is that it's very easy to use for as young as 3 year olds."}

They told me I could atleast transfer my paid apps to a new device.. 1. Uh.. you damn well BETTER and 2. Yeah I'm not buying another device.\n\nWhen the device worked, it was really slow but the apps are great and educational. My kids mostly just hung out in the paint shop through, sometimes the pet game and later the recording studio.\n\nAlso, there is this weird issue where if you make a profile with your child's name and then rename the profile, you cannot revert back to any previously used names.. The device stores them into it's hardwear for whatever wasteful reason and tells you that the name has already been used. I.e. your kid finds their way into the customize your profile tab (which is accessible to them so they can personalise their walpapper and such) and accidently changes their name, you cant go back and fix it. Kelly is now Keally or something. Dumb."}

I think it could get monotonous if a kid play this too often, they might lose interest, but we limited him to playing it at the gym so it's his special treat to get to play it.  Lately he's been more interested in the camera/art features than the cartridge games.  The camera has some fun filters (pre-snapchat) like you can put your face on an animal...he had a lot of fun taking pictures of his grandpa and putting his face on a bear, monkey, etc.  It's a very sturdy toy, I did get the protective case for it, so that probably helps, but it's definitely made for small children and made to stand up to them playing with it"}

I think it is very expensive kids tablet especially there is no support from LeapFrog. You would assume they would build something stronger or have the protective gear for it, nope not the case. I would highly recommend to get a regular tablet with protective gear. You can easily find an Android tablet for the same price with tons of free apps and/or paid apps which are way cheaper than LeapPad games.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "We have had two of these for 15 months now. Long-term battery life has been the only problem. BOTH of them began losing battery life after 12- 14 months. My kids don't use this every day either, they use it maybe 4- 5 times a month on long car rides for a total of 10- 12 hours on each. The first one went at 13 months and the battery would only last half an hour at best unplugged from the wall.  It was just past the warranty so Leapfrog customer service was awesome and replaced it for the one, even the replacement does not last 6 hours but it survives he car trips so that's fine. The second one now only lasts about an hour before the battery runs out. I think I'm out of luck there.\n\nThis Leappad Ultra overall has been awesome for my kids. Slightly disappointed with the limited internet access but I suppose that's why they came out with the Epic.\n\nMy kids all love the Ultra. My 2 year old started being able to maneuver the apps and play with it around 2 1/2 - 3 years of age. My 5 year old it's still perfect for. My 7 year old gets bored as she finishes the games too quickly. We have more than 35 games ranging from cheap quick puzzles and show episodes to full on $20 games. Having that many is probably why she still plays with it at all at this age. Although she has not yet surpassed language and math yet so that's still on-target with her skills. It's just the games that are not as exciting anymore for her. Overall I'd say by the time she's  7 1/2- 8 we'll need to move on to a more sophisticated gaming tablet like Epic or Kids Kindle.\n\nThe games are pricey but can be manageable when you get a Gift card on sale and combine it with the online app promotions like 30% off. We love that it can still use the cartridges but also can hold lots of space for downloaded games. This was an upgrade from the Leappad 2, and it's far better for all ages, even my 2 1/2 year old enjoys this one better and can maneuver the apps well. I'm really pleased that over the years they've all used the cartridges and grown with them but unfortunately they are phasing those out and we'll be stuck with unusable cartridges. On the plus side, everything we downloaded can be played on ALL the tablets (we have 3 plus the broken one) so we don't have kids fighting over cartridges or accidentally losing a $20 game cartridge.  If we buy a new tablet we simply download again all the games we ever purchased. It does say they have a limit to how many time they can we downloaded, but we had 2 of the old Leapfrog 2's years ago, and then downloaded those same games onto 3 of the Ultras with no issue."}

So essentially they traded. Although all toys in my house are for everyone. So if yiur buying for a 2yo, just get a nabi jr."}

I had issues setting one of them up because the leapfrog site went down in the middle of the setup.  Now six months later my son's tablet won't load games, it powers off every time he tries to play a game.  So I ran the repair function and it worked for five minutes, now it won't even boot up.  My daughter's tablet won't connect to wifi, so if it needed updated I will have to plug it into the computer.  She still loves it, but my son is very frustrated that his son't work."}

I cracked the screen on the first one and didn't realize until after I threw it out that Leapfrog would replace it. I'm not used  to a company standing behind their product like that.\n\nMy son is 5 years old and has used this since he was 3. It has great learning tools and we especially like the books. It helps him learn to read and he can read stories on his own. He loves drawing pictures, taking photos and making videos. It is great to bring along on trips in the airport, or the car. He will put his headphones on and get to work. He calls it his \"ipad\". We've tried the kids version of the amazon fire, but I think this is a much better alternative because it is more controlled from a content perspective, appeals to younger ages by being more user friendly to that demographic, and is extremely durable when it gets dropped a lot.\n\nI will be buying a second for my 2 year old in the very near future. You will not regret the purchase."}

My oldest daughter had her last one for over two years before the battery finally gave up life.  One of the two I ordered in May (purchased for my 6 year old) must have had a faulty battery because by April we were having trouble with getting it to turn on, by May it was questionable as to when it would work and then as of last week we can not get it to turn on at all.  It waited until just after the return date to mess up and an extended warranty was not available when I ordered them.  The problem was not due to operator error, as my daughter takes very good care of her tablet and we had a very good case for protection.  I give three stars because the actual product itself is very good; but having a three month old faulty tablet is a huge issue."}

No reason for it to cut off right?  Called leapfrog and they replaced it, yaaay no worries. THEN about 6-7 months later we had the same charging issues. Our son cannot play the device at all without it being plugged in. It seems to be a common issue as there is a Youtube video to fix it, but you risk voiding the warranty.

They were both fighting over who got to use the Leapfrog tablet we had and they were both getting upset over which games and shows they each wanted to watch. With the limited room on the other one they would have to choose and it was a huge hassle to have to delete and redownload all the time. I bought 2 of these and now they each have one, they each have their own games and shows and don't have to share. I LOVE that it has a 6-8 hour battery compared to the 2-3 hour that the other one had and I love that I don't have to worry about my 4 year old downloading random games from the game store. It was a hassle buying the cartridges because they were always losing them, however since I switched to buying them online and downloading them it has been a dream. Nothing to lose, nothing to fight over! Its great for long drives! And I love that it came with 11 downloaded games! If you haven't checked these out before you should now!

My grandaughter lost interest in it after about a day. The games are somewhat difficult to understand for someone that young, its confusing to any child (even after showing them), how to use the camera, the painting app, etc. It was out of the question to set up the internet and browsing for online games or even videos as she had no idea of what to press or how to use the Leapfrog, even with plenty of instruction from her mother. There are game \"cartridges\" (seems a little outdated?) to plug in to play children's games, and without sitting to show your children repeatedly how to operate the system and play these games, its not useful. I noticed that the games are not as responsive as they should be (probably a system problem) and difficult for a child to understand.\nMaybe my granddaughter was too young for this, but even as she got older she wasn't interested. She used her mom's Ipad instead to watch movies, Youtube and play online games.\nInstead, buy them an Ipad when they are old enough. Its easy enough to operate and does what it is supposed to.\n My  daughter felt bad gave  me the Leapfrog back to me after a year, to see if any of my other grandchildren wanted it. No takers. 150$ down the drain."}

It has always been slow to connect to wifi but now, April, the screen is jarbled, with lines running through it making it unusable. His parents insist it was not dropped, but even if it was, it was in a LeapPad protective skin and should be rugged for kids' use. When his mother contacted LeapPad all they would offer is an exchange for another $70 fee. They say the inside screen is cracked and that is more expensive to repair. Needless to say I am extremely dissatisfied.\n\nWe had gotten his brother, who is now six, the LeapPad2 when he was three. It has worked beautifully and provided hours of enjoyment. He now has his own Kindle. We liked the Ultra because of the WiFi and the touch screen which is why we chose it for the younger grandson. Never did we anticipate problems and poor Customer Service from LeapPad. I guess my advice would be \"Buyer beware\" and avoid the Ultra."}

Finally, a month after they shipped the second leappad, they send me another dud.  This one has a label on it that says \"sample\".  It won't hold a charge and only works if plugged into an outlet.  Now they expect me to pay shipping so they can \"test\" it.  I'm so frustrated because I wasted a ton of money on games.  And the apps - you can only download the app to so many devices per account.

They offered a one-time replacement for a cost of $69.99 plus shipping (which is about $15 less than what I could have gotten it off of Amazon). I took them up on the offer as the LeapPad was a gift from my mother to my son and I feel guilty that it's broken already, but I'll be really mad if the next LeapPad's screen is broken by the end of March."}

Perfect for a younger child, as opposed to a tablet, in my opinion.\nA bit heavy, if you are comparing it to an iPad, but that doesn't seem to bother the kids using it. I would recommend buying a rubber case, just to prolong the life of the LeapPad."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "We bought this to replace the LeapPad2.\nThe screen is much larger and made more durable than the LeapPad2. That was the reason why we replaced the item, because our daughter broke the screen by pressing too hard with the stylus. The LeapPad Ultra has now held up for 3 years.\nUnlike the LeapPad2 this one is rechargeable by standard. It has built in Wifi for use with some apps and downloading but the connection is extremely slow. I don't recommend using it much. For this reason, it gives you the option to update programs with LeapFrog Connect using the Wifi but I strongly recommend doing that by USB connection just because of how slow it is.\nThe app lineup is great, with some licensed tie-ins (like Disney and Nickelodeon) and many original programs. I recommend LeapFrog over vTech because of the app lineup."}

Your most basic \"adult\" tablet has way better resolution.\n2) the screen isn't glass, its soft plastic and is VERY easy for a young child, which is the product's demographic, to press to hard on the screen amd permanently damage it! Even with the screen protector!\n3) the pressing recognition is horrible. The default paint app that lets you draw with paintbrushes or various other tools is so bad its appauling. It doesnt make curved lines. It only makes straight lines and only registers half your movements.\n\nThe programming of the leap pad is so lacking there is no reason why such a poorly designed kids tablet is worth more than majority of android tablets.\n\nDo yourself a favor, just buy an android tablet for your child amd download education apps for free on the appstore. There are plenty!\n\nLeapfrog products are just overpriced garbage. Im honestly shocked. I bought this for my daughter for christmas and im so dissapointed ill never buy a leapfrog product again."}

As everyone knows, kids these days are already tech savvy. I looked into the LeapFrog Ultra and I am not disappointed with this purchase at all. Knowing toddlers aren't often easy on their toys and can be very accident prone, this is the perfect tablet for them. My son has dropped this many times and it is still in one piece and works great. I love that all of the apps are oriented towards children and that he cannot access the bad things that can be found through the internet. He has actually learned shapes and colors thanks to this product. He loves going on the video search and watching the videos that they have available. He actually found some of his favorite videos on his own. The other plus side to it, is that I am able to create a pin, so that when he tries to access the app store, he can't get in to make purchases. Also, after creating the account (attached to my email address), I receive periodic emails about what he has been up to and how he is doing with answering questions and other things. It is the perfect tablet! I have had a love for LeapFrog for a while (at least since he got his MyPal Scout) but now I really love LeapFrog. Best learning tablet for toddlers! I highly recommend this product!"}

When it works right, it's great but in no time at all the wall charger stops charging....have bought several new wall chargers to no avail. We have to charge it using the car adapter. Also have a lot of software issues where the device doesn't sync, randomly deletes everything on it, or says the memory is full when it is not. When plugged into a computer the device is not recognized and cannot be repaired using their software. Thankfully, I purchased the protection plan when I purchased it from Best Buy and will get store credit. Another unfortunate downside is that it only uses app and games specifically designed for Leap Pad. Once we upgrade to a better device we will lose all the apps we purchased for the Leap Pad. All that being said, my son has gotten hours of fun and a lot of use out of the device which is why I gave it the three starts.

Technically 2010 if you count My Own LeapTop.\n\nWe've had 3 - LeapPad 2's and Now we have 1 - LeapPad 2 and 2 - LeapPad Ultra's.\n\nI wanted my Samsung Tablet back so we had to find another solution for the kids. Our original LeapPad 2 purchased in November 2012 for my daughter, and is still going (its now been passed down to my 1 year old). These are amazing little devices. We purchased our 2nd LeapPad 2 in March of 2014 for my Son (He was 15 months old). He dropped a large metal car on it and cracked the screen in November of 2014. LeapFrog replaced it at no charge. In October 2015 his sister stood on his LeapPad, during a cartridge game argument and cracked his screen. Since we had already replaced the LeapPad, LeapFrog offered some apps toward our new LeapPad. Which is cool, I was just looking to see if we can order a screen or take it somewhere to replace the screen. They can not authorize screen replacement. It will void the warranty. Which my warranty was already dead. I looked around a bit but from everything I could find involved sodering and a little more work than I was willing to try.\n\nSO ANYWAYS\n\nWe purchased him a LeapPad 3 from a large \"big box\" retailer but then Amazon had the Ultra on sale for an excellent price so we returned the LP3 and got the Ultra.\n\nBoth kids love them. Yes the apps are pricey. Yes the games are pricey. But I know what they are playing. I don't have to worry about unauthorized in app purchases or inappropriate pop up ads. Their favorite shows are available for download, they have plenty of games both digital and cartridge. They have books. I like that the shows we download transfer to our LeapTV. So the money is spent once and covers a lot of their platforms. I love the fact my children are getting educated without even realizing it.\n\nI wish there was a storage system for the games that made it easier to keep them in one place. I'll post a picture of what I am currently using if you'd like an idea. But I am constantly on the look out for a solution.\n\nI like that these hook up to our home WIFI, I can do a lot the the parent account stuff right from the tablet without having to hook it up to the computer. I swear every time you have to hook it up some update takes FOREVER. Hey LeapFrog, send me an email when there's a new software update? Have some little pop up on the LeapPad...Save me s0ome time.\n\nThe issues I have, have nothing to do with the device.\n\nThe LeapSearch kinda made me nervous, but after playing with it I'm ok, Its safe.\n\nThe battery lasts pretty long. I believe it says 6 hours but we've gone days without recharging it. But we have a car charger just in case.\n\nDoctors appointments, long car rides, rainy days...This saves the day."}

It's Ok, or maybe we are just spoiled with the speed and quality of iPads and Kindles.\n\nPros:\n I don't have to worry about her going to the app store and buying stuff, or getting on YouTube and watching video's she shouldn't be watching. The games all transfered over from her Leappad 2 which is nice, I didn't have to re buy anything. We buy all our games digital since we don't want to loose the cartridges. I love the educational factor to Leap Frog products, we have owned them for 10 + years.\n\nCons:\nThis thing is SLOW.. super slow to load, slow to turn on.. and the internet browser is pretty much pointless. The voice recorder.. it has 20 different slots to record things, mainly annoying things your kid is doing at the time then she replays them over and over and over and over... I wish I could \"hide\" the voice recorder. :) But maybe your kid isn't as annoying as mine! :) Navigating the parent settings is very tedious. On top of the system being so slow going in and out of the menus to set it up pretty much took me all day. It was a long drawn out process.\n\nEnd decision... If i had to go back and buy her a tablet again I think I would of just got her her own Kindle fire and locked it down with Free Time. It's faster, has free games and apps that you are not paying $20 + for on this. When this one finally gets to slow for her to handle that's the route I will probably go.

One of the free apps is the app store where you will HAVE to buy every game if you want actual learning games...any games!\nI don't consider a calculater, voice memo, clock, calendar, camera, notepad, or any of the \"free apps\" anything FUN or game like!!!\nSo after spending the $100 for the tablet, be prepared to spend hundreds more on apps, and games just to use the damn thing!!!\nI bought an app bundle for $35, and it said 5 apps came with it...what a deal!  ... (do I have a choice?)  So I buy it...1 game, 4 cartoons!\nSo then I order a few of the $17 game cartridges thinking those will be better....I could have gotten better apps on google play store FOR FREE!!!!\nAbsolute WASTE of $$$$$$!!!!!  I'm so pissed!!!!\nWorst purchase ever!\nI'm ready to just toss it, it's basically that worthless.\nLook into something else that has Google play store so you can actually get some free games."}

Also important to us that children \"computing\" does NOT have Internet access.\n\nThis is our first leap frog tablets  (only Explorer game systems before) All of our \"green\" game cartridges from our Explorers worked in these tablets, but the off-brand \"white\" cartridges did Not.\n\nThe downloading of games, which we didn't do much before seems good with our first 2 games. They are kind of expensive vs used cartridges, but one download purchase applies to both tablets, so both of those users can play those games without fighting over cartridges (that's nicer the more I think about it.)\n\nI would certainly recommend Leap Frog products"}

I've had it for 2 or so years now, and can tell you almost immediately I wasn't happy with the purchase. For starters, it's heavy. I bought it for a small kid, so I was not happy that it weighed so much. It crashes CONSTANTLY. And it's SOOO SLOW to try and load anything. To the point that you just want to turn it off and not bother. Not to mention, the games are $25 on average a piece! They do have some less expensive games, but they're not fun or entertaining. It's so expensive, and not worth the money at all. Now having it for 2 or so years, it is still working - but it's been used very lightly b/c my daughter, while she liked the leap games, wasn't getting a huge variety b/c of the cost... which caused her to get bored with it. She'll hop on still every once in a while to go onto the online kid videos, but that's it, (she's 5). I bought an Amazon kindle fire that allows learning apps for far cheaper, and includes netflix. Of which she loves! You can't add apps to this leap pad. The only positive I have on this aside from the fact that the learning games (expensive ones at least) are nice, is that it is nice to be only kid friendly. I don't have to worry about her getting onto something that's inappropriate. I wouldn't recommend this product to be honest though. Far better options out there."}

If you run into issues with adding/syncing games on multiple leap pads you will have to figure it out yourself. Low levels of comprehension from staff, complex walk through to fix issues.

The games run from $5 to $20 and if you're like me, you'll end up buying plenty of them.\n\nThe first LeapPad I got was a LeapPad 2 for my daughter. It blew through batteries, so I got a battery pack and charger. Otherwise I have been fairly happy with it.\n\nWhen I got a LeapPad for my son, I opted for the Ultra. It had a charger, a bigger screen, and WiFi. I got one used on eBay.\n\nThe first one I bought has a problem with the screen- it would freeze occasionally. The machine was less than a year old, but since I bought it used, LeapFrog would not honor the warranty. They offered a discount on a replacement. The seller offered a larger discount on another used one (it was after his 30 day warranty). So I got another used one.\n\nThis one worked great for a year, then one day my son complained that it was not working. I looked at the screen and it was covered with lines. After consulting with LeapFrog we determined the screen had broken from the back. Broken screens are not covered by warranty and once again, I got it used. LeapFrog does NOT sell replacement screens nor do they offer repairs or even recycle broken units. They did offer me 2 games (value $20) when I registered a replacement.\n\nWe replaced it with the LeapFrog 3. It has a smaller screen, but it is also sturdier.\n\nLeapFrog should sell replacement screens or offer repair service for these. It is a very expensive disposable toy. And the kids like it too much not to replace it if it breaks."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "I purchased the Ultra for my 3 year old son. I went back and forth with this purchase based solely on the reviews here, and they all seemed to echo the same complaints. I just wanted a kid friendly tablet for the little guy, so I went ahead and purchased this. I got it about a week before Christmas to ensure the tablet was in working condition (and 30 day Amazon return in case it craps out).\n\nIt comes with a USB/wall charger. You can choose 1 of 3 apps to download for free. If the tablet sits untouched for 5 minutes, it will shut off.\n\nRight out of the box I charged it for a few hours. When I was ready to mess with it, it powered on quickly. You have to follow some steps to set up the tablet: connect to your wifi, then set up an account on leapfrog to purchase apps, and then set up the child's profile. Now the display is a bit archaic in today's fast-paced tech world. This model is only a year or so old, Leapfrog could have used a more upgraded interface. The response time is rather slow, so if your child is used to an iPad or smartphone this could test their patience.  The tablet comes with a stylus pen or you can also use your finger to open apps.\n\nWhen you look for apps to download on Leapfrog's site, they'll range from $5-$20, and there's app bundles too. (**Purchase a $20 download card on Amazon or Target when they're on sale)\n\nFor the price it's listed currently ($59.99), it's a good grab, if this was $100+ I'd be sending it back. It's just ok, something to keep them occupied in the car or at the store.  I agree with other reviews that this tablet is best suited for the younger crowd up to age 6 (that's even pushing it)."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "This tablet is OK as a toy, to be played with for a short period. But, your child will quickly get tired of it. In fact, older children (4 and older) will grow out of it very quickly. Our 4-year old stopped using it within about 6 months and only went back to it occasionally. It is possibly best for very small kids, if you are comfortable with them having a 'computer'.\nThe screen is the old type, which you have to press on to get it to work and it is fairly likely to break. Check out the Google searches and answers for 'LeapPad screen broken' - there are lots. Our experience is that the screen broke irreparably within one year - ie it did not last Christmas to Christmas. LeapFrog have informed us that they do not do repairs and the warranty period is very short (less than one year).\nThe price is currently very low and you are definitely getting what you're paying for. If you are happy with a device that will look like a tablet and keep little kids amused for 6+months, then this is a good bet. It does look good and the games are good fun for little kids.\nThe system 'lockdown' means you can be completely confident that your kids are safe online and playing the games.\nGames, apps and books are very expensive - expect to pay around $7.50 for an eBook, up to $20 for a new game and around $10 per app.\nThe real issue is the processor. It is extremely slow. Load times are long, accessing the web takes ages and the tablet will spend a lot of time with the circling logo on the screen whilst it thinks. Young kids don't mind this, but your older ones, possibly used to parent smartphones and iPads, will tire of it quickly.\nAll-in-all, I would recommend that you consider spending the extra $20 or so on the Amazon Fire for Kids package - you will get a two year 'no questions asked' warranty, access to Amazon Freetime for a year included (no expensive games or apps to buy on top of the purchase price) and the technology is far superior. You also get a bumper inclued, which means you don't need to buy the case, which costs $25 for the LeapPad (and will be needed as the cartridge games get lost very easily indeed without somewhere to keep them and the LeapPad device itself is actually quite fragile)."}

I contacted LeapFrog, and they said because I was past the 12 months, there was nothing they can do. This device didn't even make it to 100 hours of use and the battery has failed completely. I tested it several times, charging it up and then keeping it awake and it never made it more than 30 minutes. I was offered a discount on a new tablet, but there's no way I'd spend more money on this (just bought 3 new games, which are not exactly cheap).

Their technical support is also god awful. I'm talking beyond abysmal. The people on the phone are not only not helpful, they go out of their way to be rude. They actually question whether I've bought the thing or apps that are MISSING. It's appalling.\n\nDon't buy this thing. Do yourself a favor. It takes me ALL DAY to \"sync\" my leappad to add or delete an app. It's horrible. I want to stick a knife in my eye.  No. Seriously. A knife. Maybe a big old blade. It would be less painful."}

It may take a few times of starting over before you even get to the home screen. None of them have all the content we bought for it due to apps disappearing and having to be reloaded again and again.

He had been asking for a tablet for a while and I wanted to get him something educational AND fun.  I also figured it would be a good investment since it claims to be 'kid tough' and he has a little brother. I thought once he was done I could hand it down to his brother. The app packages are ridiculous expensive, so it was nice to get a percentage of for my first purchase (theres why I gave it the first star). My son loved it (2nd star). But let me tell you, KID TOUGH MY A$$. It didn't take 6 months for it to be dropped and cracked so badly that most of the screen was just black and useless. I tried so hard to make sure they took care of it, it was an 'in home only' plaything. No trips to the park, they read books in the car....and it still managed to render itself useless in less than a year. Don't waste your money if you have a child that will test its 'kid tough' feature. If you have a gentle kid (lucky) and patience for the craptastic music app, this may be okay for you."}

Most of the games are backwards compatible and easy for even a 2 year old to use. There are also apps that sing educational songs, play tv episodes from leapfrog and some nick jr. and read along books that require no interaction for younger kids. Most of the games we have are adaptive and automatically adjust to their playing level.

The game was a tooth brushing game...all you do is rub your finger on a dirty tooth before the music stops. That's it. If you want to have access to the many books and learning games advertised to come with the expensive device, you will have to pay $8-$35 per app. Crazy! I am returning them tomorrow.

From the pictures as shown I could only tell there is a slight difference on the front----the color of the frame outside the screen, either black or green, and as well as the printing on the top. After I decided to accept whatever would be shipped to me, I placed the order, not knowing the inside differences at all.\n\nFortunately enough, I received a Ultra XDi ! Compared with iPad, yes, it is slow, you always have to wait the small cirle goes round and round for loading. But I do like the Ultra XDi over the platinum,  by the good-looking.\n\nFor a user in China, the biggest short-coming is that you cannot pay in the appcenter by credit card due to region limit.

My only complaint is it is a little slow and luckily my kids don't realize it.\nYes it can get pricey with having to buy leapfrog specific games, but you can always get a deal! I buy a leapfrog download card from amazon when they are cheaper then the $20 you get. You can save at least $5, if not more. Then when you go to redeem your leapfrog card, look for discount codes on leapfrog's site and sales or promotions. I have never paid full price for any of the games or videos.\nMy 5 year old loves the different character learning games and when my other little guy was 2, I put some videos on it for him and they both still watch them.\nYes you can get free android or apple apps, but I think these leapfrog games are well worth the money spent as long as your getting good deals on download cards and sales, promotions or discount codes."}

It was not dropped, abused, or trampled, so there is no good reason for its failure. Several others had posted reviews with the same problem and I chose to ignore those reviews - my mistake. Prior to the unit's untimely death, I noticed a couple of other things I didn't like: 1) apps load very slowly (granted, it's not an ipad or an Android, so maybe I'm being a little harsh here) and 2) The display isn't that great. For a high resolution display, I was expecting something a little more dramatic in terms of color. For example, all of the colors on the drawing app are pale and dull. Again, I understand that this is not an ipad or a high end Android device but I was expecting a little more from a product that advertises itself as having such a great screen. Also, anyone buying this product should know that the apps are VERY expensive. Granted, many of them a very good learning apps, but nonetheless it's a little risky paying $15 for an app that may or may not interest a child."}

The older 2 games still work great and have held up, we just wanted the new bells and whistles! This version is a joke. Bought 2 as Christmas gifts, one lasted maybe a month, and I made sure my kids treated them carefully. It appeared to have a cracked screen -- just like some of the pictures posted by other reviewers. Not a kid tough toy at all. So I contacted leapfrog and they were helpful, to a degree. I received a new game and that one worked well for a couple of weeks then one day when my daughter went to play it it had a screen message to plug it in and connect to leapfrog connect. What the what?? I tried, I contacted LF, they told me to uninstall and reinstall etc etc. long story short wasted a lot of time trying to 'fix' the new one and now we have 2 pieces of expensive junk that don't work. I gave up trying. So don't waste your time. Oh we still do have the second one from Christmas, it mostly works ok I suppose. But it is slow, freezes frequently, and frankly the kids have forgotten about it because my younger one was so distraught that hers didn't work anymore but her older sisters did, that I took it out of circulation.

Easily keeps him quiet and entertained when we need a few minutes to occupy him.\n\nPROS: Super durable. Has been dropped a time or 2 onto carpet from about 3 feet and suffered zero damage. He did manage to scratch the screen with something, but they are barely noticeable. I love that he cannot order anything accidentally and the limited internet he can actually get is targeted just for kids. The app menu is pretty easy to navigate. Speaker is very loud and clear so no problems hearing the device.\nThe games change and \"learn\" how your child is progressing and changes the difficulty based on that. Since my son has special needs, getting educational value out of the device is super important to me.\n\nCONS: The buttons themselves could be *easier* to navigate for my son, but he is learning. The large size can get in the way, but we do not mind at all. Slow loading times, but not unbearable. The games are kind of expensive, luckily he only sticks to sesame street and we found some games on clearance at Target for like $4."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "Not recommended from the perspective that you cannot set play time limits on this.  I think it should be 30-45 minutes max a day, but sometimes my boys sneak in many times that.  I don't like the power struggles that ensue.  If the device would time out like the android tablet I set up for them, this would be a non-issue.  I would just go the straight android tablet route if I had to do this again, then use applock and kidsplace.  Those two apps together work nicely.\n\nThe second reason I don't like this is the potential accessibility of advertisements for games.  This can be loved down by the parent at least.\n\nIf give it more stars if they'd allow the setting of time limits (kidsplace proves this is possible).  Game controls and app loading lags would keep it from getting more than 3 stars.\nThe third reason I don't like it is I won't use it for reading games.  I don't want my boys getting used to lights and buzzes when they read.  That won't help them acclimate to real books later.."}

In my opinion this is the most horribly designed software in the world. I work for a software company and it still took 20 hours to sync a new leappad. The directions and online help are worthless as they tell you to click on things that don't exist. I am in the process of trying to sync a new one and having the same issues. We are honestly going to just throw it away as we cant get it to work. It comes with WIFI and I bought a bunch of apps and then tried to download all of the old apps that I had purchased and it simply never installed them. I then tried to sync with my computer and after 12 hours of syncing it said it was done but nothing happened and it still did not download anything.

I bought the LPU for my son with the hopes that it would be an exclusively educational alternative to an iPad or Galaxy Tablet.  I can't believe how horribly slow this device is.  The apps are terribly overpriced for the limited amount of content each 20-25 dollar purchase provides.  We are going to sell this on Craigslist and go with a regular tablet of the same price range.  This will mean changing settings for kids only content and putting it in an indestructible case but eliminating the lag and crashes will be well worth the extra work.  Leap Frog you have changed our opinion of you for the worse.  It seems that you have turned into a money hungry company selling inferior products under a name that used to belong to a company that  cared about the quality of its product."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "We didn't purchase through Amazon - but I used this site to decide on the LeapPad because of the reviews so wanted to add my own.  For starters this is a LeapFrog product so it only uses LeapFrog programs.  I knew this going in (as it seems some reviewers did not) and this was my biggest selling point as I would rather my child have access to educational programming from a company that has dedicated itself to that field than a lot of apps and such that claim to be educational but are not.  Second this is not a tablet, it is a learning toy, so while it is set up to have the \"tablet feel\" it is a little slower in operating and has very limited internet capability - again another selling point for us as our 2.5 year old needs neither.  We wanted something that would familiarize her with technology and internet, but with in very strict guidelines and this has proved to be perfect.\n\nIt has had some glitches when using the internet youtube feathers which are solved by turning it off and back on, it also does not move as fast as a tablet, but our daughter had very limited \"device\" interaction previously to this, so doesn't realize that the slight lag isn't normal.  The camera isn't by any means close to that of a tablet, but again is perfect for a young child and she loves it.\n\nI would think the only reason this product would not be a good fit for you is if you had a child that already had a tablet or you had a child on the older end of the age range.  I feel that my daughter will probably use this up until she \"ages out\", but if you are considering this for a kid who is 7-9 it might be best to save the money and purchase an actual tablet instead of turning around and doing it in another year or so."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "It is OK and my son enjoys it, but at 3 years old, he is finding it to be slow.  He has used first gen IPad once in a while, which is way faster than the leap pad.  Every time you change apps or do anything, it waits and waits while it loads (up to 10 seconds in some cases - which in 3 year old world is an eternity).  I think the Kids Fire HD may have been a better choice, particularly the break it replace it policy.  Apps are really expensive for what you get, the ones that can be downloaded don't have the content that the chips do, so really they are pretty basic.  Fifteen to thirty dollars for an app is a lot.\n\nOn the other side, the content is for sure safe for kids.  There is no way to get to any thing other than leapfrog stuff (without hacking it).  I am not sure if the amazon tablet has that feature, although they show a kids safe selection.  If I knew what I know now, I wouldn't buy this."}

We have been using iPads and a Kindle for the past two years.\n\nI was frustrated with iPad apps because:\n(1) The 3 year old always needed a lot of help.  The games weren't always intuitive and it defeated the purpose of occupying him.\n(2) The apps always start to ask for more money.  The kids didn't quite understand why there were so many levels and screens they couldn't get to.\n(3) Even the \"learning apps\" felt a little junky.  Once you purchased a few, you realized they are all the same... ie, matching, or coloring, or puzzles, etc.  And they always asked for more money!\n(4) The internet accessiblity always worried me.\n\nI decided to switch to the LeapPad because I wanted a device my youngest could manage on his own without getting frustrated and needing my help.  Plus, I was hoping for better quality apps, and interactive learning apps that provided some educational value.\n\nPros:\n\n-The apps geared towards young children (3 and 4 yr) are manageable without help.  They don't require reading and the instruction is good.\n- Leapfrog has a lot of the characters they know from their favorite TV shows\n- The whole thing is \"child friendly\" so there's no accidental viewing on You Tube or messing up your iPad\n- The age of the child is programmed in so you don't have to adjust the skill level for games.  It knows the level for each individual child.\n- The digital apps are convenient to share on other devices\n\nCons:\n\n- Limited to the apps offered by Leapfrog\n- The responsiveness of the device is slower and it's hard to get used to waiting\n- I have a little trouble syncing the device, and adding new content takes a long time\n- The good apps are very expensive.  You can spend nearly $100 very easily!"}

Upon having his tablet which was the leap pad ultra he had learned to use it quite well. Though it is flawed and limited to what it can do. He still found joy in some of the already programed features. However the other day my son accidentally dropped his sippy while on his tablet and it cracked the screen. Don't expect leapfrog to do much but tell you to buy another one. Theu do offer a warranty but what they don't tell you is that you only get this warranty for 2 years and you HAVE to buy it from their site. No other retailers. On top of that theu also do not replace parts or do they accept accidents from the age groups that they aim for. It's almost impossible to get a new one. Personally after having a leapfrog I will NOT ever think about getting a tablet again. They back you into a corner if it breaks wither buy a new one or hope someone else is selling an already broken one with parts that still work that you need. The apps also don't transfer over either you have to hook them up to the computer and transfer the data over yourself. Our next tablet will be one without a BS warranty and one that we can replace some thing so simple as a damn screen."}

Does not allow \"kiddy\" surfing of internet appropriate sites, even though it offers wi-fi.  Apps are mostly interactive books, so I'd rather just read to my child myself and buy him books.  I like PBS apps for kids, which are free and I feel more interactive and educational for his age (he's already identifying letters with Super Why).  They average $7+ a piece, so they get pricey very fast.  It also froze a few times and takes a while to load screen to screen.

After all, this is essentially a childs toy, not a sleek new device for tech geeks.\n\nHowever, after tinkering with this device with my three year old daughter for the last year, I will agree that the slow operating system does hinder the user experience.  For us, the LeapPad Ultra was purchased so our three year old daughter would stop using our older daughter's Kindle Fire.  Quickly after the purchase of the LeapPad Ultra, our three year old continued to prefer the Kindle Fire, as it was faster, the games were easier to access and the overall experience was more enjoyable.\n\nTo this day she is uninterested in her LeaPad Ultra.  It is slow.  Painfully slow.  I watch my daughter attempt to interact with the games and activities and observe her frustration with the laggy games and limited touchscreen response.  Furthermore, the games are extremely overpriced on the app store and the customer service is lazy at best.  For example, after battling with an app store error for some time, I received an annoying copy/paste response placing the blame of the error in my hands.\n\nI will not purchase another product from LeapFrog.  There are many more options for children.\n\nSeriously, stay away.  This product is bad."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "So much better investment for your child than the free apps on your phone.  I had scoured all the free or low cost phone apps trying to find educational games for my son.  Most of them require you to spend money when you get past the basic 1 or 2 levels.  The phone apps don't \"walk\" you through the process.  You have to keep instructing your child how to play each level of each game.  The leapfrog games and apps verbally walk your child through all the instructions... talking to your child, explaining what is required for each step.  It explains what you did wrong if you choose the wrong answer.  It combines an education of a subject with game playing and if you \"pass\" that you get to play the game.  We own approximately 30 games now and I can honestly say each $2-15 game/app that I bought has been totally worth it.  My son has learned more about math and reading, science and geography, space and exploration, health and hygiene, recycling and the planet than any other device or game or movie that I have ever bought.  If you want to be cheap and don't care about your child's education than stick to the free phone apps and hope that he doesn't see porn sites advertisement that has popped up on several occasions on those games.  If you want your child to be fully engaged, learning and having genuine fun...get the pad.  It is like having a tutor for your child for a lot less money. I whole heartedly recommend it."}

On top of this, all of the apps cost $10-$15 and most are based on TV characters.

At first, it appeared to be going well, but then, on step 3, it froze up. I have now called the Leapfrog support team twice. They have given me two separate actions to fix the leappad (first to reset the firmware, which kept errorring out before completing; second to reset the device). Both fixes initially gave an estimated time of 15-20 minutes, but took much longer. I'm still stuck with a birthday gift for my son that isn't working. Calling support again...\nUPDATE: So, a few hours later, the leappad appears to be working. But, there's a catch. While I was initially setting it up, it told me that I was going to have a one time opportunity to purchase apps at up to 30% off (if I bought 3 or more). Well, guess what? After going through all the steps they had me do, this offer disappeared. When I called to complain about it, they initially offered me a code for 15% off...really? this is the same offer currently showing for absolutely everyone on their website. I was furious! So, because YOUR product didn't work out of the box, I spend 5 hours of my day trying to fix it, only to be told that I am no longer eligible for the 30% offer? After I said as much, they offered me two free apps from a select list (read here, the low dollar ones). Then, they asked me if I was happy. No, Leapfrog, I'm not happy. I took the free apps, as there was nothing else they were willing to offer. And, by the way, if you want to talk to their tech support on the phone, you have M-R 9-5, F 9-3. So, if you are a working parent...good luck.\nI'm so frustrated and really hoping the experience will improve from here. I'm a longtime Leapfrog promoter...have the letter, word factory, and math adventure DVDs. Had the tag Junior. Had a handheld game. I really wanted to love this...\nSo disappointed so far.\n\nUpdate : so, the unit kept acting strangely... Screen would rotate, graphics slipping off screen, so I returned it. As always, I love amazon. Took the return, no problem, and sent me a new unit. This one is working fine. Guess I just got a lemon the first time around. Fingers crossed this one continues to work."}

My boys have dropped them several times and they are still working. My youngest recently submerged his in the bathtub as he took a bath and it was under water for a good 30 seconds.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "I received two of these as gifts for my daughters for Christmas. Initially we were pretty excited. After some simple setup, my kids were on their way to zoning out in electronic bliss. (Heads up, parents of multiples: register both leap pads to the same email account so that all purchases are shared).\n\nSo far, I like that the tablet takes into account my children's ages and seems to tender the games toward their appropriate age groups. I like that it's all kid friendly, and they have the freedom to open apps without my consent. I like that the apps can be \"learning\" based. I enjoy that their leappads connect, hassle free (really, I don't have to do a thing, they sync up on their own) and the girls can play together. I'm pleased with how durable these things are - they've been dropped, stepped on, carried around by the pen that comes attached, you name it, they're still going as strong as the day we got them.\n\nThat's about where the pros end, because here are the cons with this system. First and foremost: the apps are too bloody expensive to make this a worthwhile purchase. I'm talking $10 for the *cheap* ones, and upward of $25 PER APP if there's a disney character in it. Each leappad came with a $30 card to buy whatever we want. I figured this was days of fun, but once I saw the price of a Sofia the First app, I realized that this was enough for ONE app. I stayed away from their cartridge systems for this very reason. The extreme pricing of the leappad negates its practicality entirely. After buying four full-priced apps, I will have spent $200 on this thing, the same price as an adult tablet which has access to the app marketplace where a plethora of companies produce educational games for a mere $3-$5 a piece.\n\nThat brings me to another point. The \"educational\" level of the games on the leappad is sadly mediocre. In one of the language games, the answer is always the middle choice. In most of the other games, it's pretty much just video games with a break every 5 minutes to \"solve a puzzle,\" and the puzzle is the educational portion. The narrator points out things like \"proper sentences have periods and commas,\" and \"help the dragons pay their bill by doing X.\" Okay, great, but I'd like to see more of this, and have the answers be a bit less predictable. The \"e-books\" are not very user friendly - for the life of me, I can't figure out how to get back to the beginning of the book without paging all the way back to the beginning - which no child has patience for.  You can pick a child's \"level\" in the book and it will either simplify or complicate the story and highlight the words accordingly, but once again, that requires figuring out how to get to the beginning of the book.\n\nAs far as the technology itself, it's not quite on par with the rest of the tablets on the market. The drawing program is a prime example, where the touch screen's sensitivity cuts out at odd intervals, leaving lines where you want curves and jagged edges in your circles. The games stop working fairly frequently (I don't have more details on this, the kids just complain that it's not working) and I have to tell the children to restart the tablets. I'm betting the screen is unresponsive, given the way they start tapping frantically.\n\nOverall I gave it three stars because it still keeps the kids entertained, even with the limited amount of apps I have on there for them. I like that. I was tempted to give it two stars though, because frankly leappad's blatant greed just gets my hackles up. Twenty five dollars for an app? Really? I have no idea what justifies that price, the screen resolution certainly isn't it. My advice? Buy a regular tablet - nexus or something similar - get it a kid-proof case, and go to town buying educational apps on it for your little minion. Much better bang for your buck"}

The Leap Reader is still around somewhere too, though it could have used a larger memory, it was still a nice toy.\n\nBack, to the Ultra, my son, LOVED it at first, so did we. It was great. The apps and games are big bucks but I can overlook that since it is so nice to take in the car on long trips. My one complaint at first would be that the screen wasn't sensitive as some of the better devices on the market, but I was willing to over look that even. I had drank the Kool Aid.....Fast forward only 4 months......it started to show a red screen with a battery symbol on occasion even though it still had some charge remaining. Ooh, oh! Now it is doing that all the time and not holding a charge very well. I have called Leap Frog several times and like the other reviewers said they are not that helpful, offering up weird advice like hold down the right button and home key.

I'm guessing we will be replacing it after less than 1 year.

She plays the pre loaded game, but no where as much of the YouTube video's on there. It's cool because they randomly change, so there is always something new to watch. Misc videos of music, animals or something being silly, etc. I mainly love it because if I need a break, she CAN play it for HOURS and be totally content. IF I want to watch a television show and I don't want her to hear what's going on, headphones! I've had days where I needed additional rest.... let's just say, this thing is AMAZING... It's not just a device of useless info, she can actually learn things.\n\nCons- It's a bit heavy"}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "I got my toddler this tablet because he was always stealing ours. It has all the features I was looking for: it's sturdy, it's safe, the on screen buttons are big, and it has access to various games and pre-screened online videos. Mind you, the games aren't cheap, but the quality is much better than $1 iOS games and he gets a lot of use out of them.\n\nHOWEVER - having played with our tablets before, the boy has a (reasonable) expectation that apps take less than 30 seconds to launch, that waking the device up should be instantaneous (it takes almost a minute!), etc. YouTube videos take a minute or two to start and crash frequently. The screen orientation gets stuck in the wrong position. And don't get me started about the two hours I fought the glitchy account set up process while an anxious birthday boy was dying to play with it.\n\nBottom line: this is a decent but underpowered tablet that makes my Nexus 7 feel peppy by comparison and stunted by broken-feeling software. It does work, but I wouldn't recommend it for a child with a short attention span or a parent with anger management issues."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "My 3 year old twin boys each got one of these for Christmas this year. They seem like they are built durable as they are heavy and bulky but our screen cracked less then 2 weeks later. The crack appears to be on the internal screen because until we turned the Leap Pad on this morning we didn't realize the crack. How this happened, we haven't a clue. When we contacted Leap Pad about this particular problem, of course, it isn't backed by them. The only solutions they provided for us was to either have the seller address the issue or to buy another one from them for 50% off.\n\nI would highly suggest if you're in the market for a kids tablet to go with the one Amazon sells. The apps are far more affordable and they back their products. Our kids have been playing on our Kindle Fire HD tablet for over a year and despite the drops, etc it continues to work just fine. Leap Pad has a long way to go to catch up with their product durability in my opinion!\n\nThe processor is also frustratingly slow. If your kids are used to playing on ipads or kindles, they are definitely going to feel the lag on this thing. Apps take what feel a like forever to load (I bought 6 apps and it took at least 45 mins to load, whereas the kindle is almost instant.) The touch screen sensitivity is weak too. It requires several attempts to select something."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "Most reviews here focus on comparing the LeapPad Ultra to previous tablets.  We have never owned one before so this is just what I see based on no previous LeapPad experience.  My son got this for Christmas from his great-grandparents, and he loves it.  I'm pretty lukewarm about it.  The biggest flaw is you CANNOT arrange the icons.  This means the games, videos, or ebooks that you download will in all likelihood end up on the second or third screen. This is a real hassle.  Here are my thoughts on it in list form:\n\nPROS\n- Easy setup & monitoring\n- Seems well-built/sturdy\n- Large catalog of games, books, and videos with familiar characters\n- Multiple profiles for sharing with more than one child\n\nCONS\n- Inability to arrange icons on home screen (it really will frustrate you & your child\n- Hard point stylus. Younger kids tend to press too hard.  We've actually detached it and are letting our son use one of our rubber tipped styluses until the screen protectors arrive.\n- Camera quality.  The kids want to take selfies all day and they look like they were taken in low light on a 1997 Nokia cell phone, even in good lighting. So bad.\n- Expensive online store.  Games retail at $25 and they really aren't any better than educational games from the Google Play store or iTunes.  A pretty big rip off, especially with the upfront cost.\n\nPersonally, if I could do it over again, I'd tell them to get him something else.  He likes it, sure.  The characters are fun and familiar, but the educational level of the games isn't mind blowing.  They aren't even above average.  It really isn't a great value.  I have a military grade case for my iPad so that he can play on that, and it's really a preferable experience all around to do that."}

I easily spent 100.00 after taking it out of the box, just to get it to the point where my kid could sit and play with it with apps that are relevant to her.\n2) It is very slow. Every screen load takes between 5 and 30 seconds, usually falling somewhere in the 15 second range. This happens a lot and it completely halts the experience, the music stops, the screen goes blank except for the spinning wheel of doom.\n3) Downloading a 10MB app takes 10+ minutes over Wi-Fi.\n4) The internet app loads (very slowly) into a home page with nothing but ads for $20 and $30 apps and games. Most of them with familiar Disney characters on them. They are obviously there for the kids to find, and nag their wallet carrier for. This seems like a cheap move to me.\n5) The stylus ties to the body of the unit towards the bottom. When you flip the device horizontal this is now on your left and the cord is barely long enough for the stylus to be held in the right hand in this configuration.\n\nThere are a few things that I like.\n1) It does seem durable and well built.\n2) The stylus has a built in holster on the unit, but has a very short lead.\n3) Once you get the apps on the device and running, they are pretty good educational apps.\n\nI think it won't take long (with the expensive apps) before this device ends up costing more than a 16GB wfi ipad. Which would get more mileage, has plenty of children's apps (for less than $30.00), access to apps like Netflix kids and PBS, and an overall better user experience with shorter load times."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "We're on our 4th LeapPad device - we have two kids, and they started with the LeapPad 2s. It was awfully cumbersome to get any content actually loaded on to their devices, so when I hard that the LeapPad Ultra had WiFi, it seemed like the answer to our prayers.\n\nWell...not so much.\n\nThe device itself is easy to use, sturdy, and simple for the kids to figure out. There's a decent amount of content available, and a huge selling point for us is that if you buy one product, you can install it on two different LeapPads, so we didn't have to buy two of everything. My girls love taking pictures with its camera feature, although the quality of the shots is basically what you'd expect for an add-on camera for a toy.\n\nNow for the negative. It's virtually IMPOSSIBLE to get any content loaded on to these devices. I can't get into all of the details about the problems because I have literally about 48 hours of content to draw from, but I can tell you that it took me virtually TWO SOLID DAYS to change the content on these devices before we headed out on vacation last August. I should point out that I work in IT and am 3 letters short of a whole alphabet of IT-related certifications, so I'm not one of those people who is confused by technology.\n\nFast forward to yesterday morning, when my Kindergartner came to me with her LeapPad Ultra and sweetly asked, \"Mama, can I have some more stuff on my game?\" Grimacing, I said \"Go ask your dad to help you.\" Well, it's now 24 hours later and we STILL have not gotten any sort of usable content on this stupid device. I should also point out that my husband ALSO works in IT and has an extensive background in coding and software development, in addition to just being one of those guys you call over to help you fix basically anything technology-related. He just came up with it and dropped it on my desk and said \"I'm done with this piece of s*&^. If you want to try for yourself, go for it.\" He's been working on it nonstop since he got up this morning, in addition to spending two hours on it yesterday getting it \"set up to download so we can just leave it.\"\n\nBecause none of that's very helpful in understanding what went wrong, I can add some details. In order to load content onto this device, you have to connect it to a computer that has the company's LeapFrog Connect installed on it. Ostensibly, you browse offerings in the market place, purchase them, and then load them onto the device via either the USB cable it comes with or (ha ha...insert hysterical laughter here) the built-in WiFi.\n\nOne problem is that, despite there being more room on this device than the Leap Pad 2, there is really just not a lot of space for much of anything on here, given all of the built-in stuff already loaded. So after you buy a bunch of stuff, you realize it's not going to fit. There's supposed to be a little applet letting you know how much space is on there and what will fit, but we've had issues with it SAYING that everything will fit, only to have the extremely slow process of trying to transfer content (which apparently can't be interrupted) fail.\n\nAs I type, I have the app running in the background. I'm just trying to delete everything from the game so I can try again. However, I'm unable to save any changes because apparently it's still trying to load the few apps my husband picked to the game. So I'm going to have to wait for that to fail before I can apparently start again. It's 6% done with its attempt to upload, and it's been running for about 45 minutes. Also, you have to be sitting at the computer while it does this, because if you walk away and your session suspends, it stops trying to transfer the data.\n\nLeapFrog Connect is just hideously flawed. Horrendously, terribly, horribly flawed. I feel like I could download the Library of Congress faster than it takes to transfer 3 episodes of Dora the Explorer to this device. The WiFi option is useless because if the connection gets dropped (and it does indeed have a microscopic range), the transfer just stops altogether and must be manually restarted. And half the time, you can't get the WiFi downloads status page to show anything at all - you'll want to re-start, but it will say that nothing is queued for download. Two hours later, it will be back there. You can re-start the download at that point, but then the whole cycle will just start again. This isn't my experience from one device-  we have the same problems with both the LeapPad Ultras we have, and we had the same problems with the horribly slow transfer speeds for both of the LeapPad 2 devices that we have - that's why we went to the Ultra, so we wouldn't have to sit and babysit these stupid devices. Add to the problems already experienced the random lack of ability of the device to accurately reflect what you've set it to do and the random greying out of management choices and you've created the perfect recipe for disaster.\n\nMy advice for anybody wanting this game is to try to add one game at a time. And make sure you have plenty of time to sit around babysitting your computer while you do so."}

But we got it on a $99 special before a long trip, so i was pleased to give it a try at $50 off.\nPros: completely safe educational apps.  Good for young kids (our 4 year old is learning a lot from it and enjoying it, our almost 2 year old still mostly pounds the screen with the stylus. Mostly,  not for under 2-3 unless you want to walk them through step by step).  No browser for accidental Internet surfing or unsafe sites loading.\nCons: a little slow during transitions but it doesn't seem to bother our 4 year old. Expensive apps (i have found lots on clearance at Walmart,  staples,  etc so keep your frugal eye peeled). It's heavy.\nOverall I got what i expected and wanted.  Something my sons can use on their own as a educational supplement.  Safe learning games.  Something geared towards 4-6 year olds.\nIt does say for ages 3-8 and I know those ages could still get enjoyment out of it.  If you're kids are older,  I'd look into a more advanced system.

The first day we got the LeapPad it wouldn't even work. Once plugging it and turning it on it had to automatically update. It would do an update then restart then do it again. It did this about 4 times before it just froze. It would keep saying that the leappad was almost ready to play and it just needed to be restarted. No matter how many times it restarted itself or I manually restart it would just go back to that same screen. My husband and I thought maybe it just needed to charge but 4 hours later and still NOTHING. I went all over the FAQ and forums about how to fix this and found nothing. I finally downloaded the leapfrog connect into my laptop and connected the leappad and it said there was sort of error and it had to reinstall everything. THEN, after all this hassle it finally worked but it had no battery. After being charged for HOURS, it still had no battery. So again, I hooked it up and left it alone for another couple of hours were it charged enough for 1 single bar. It also runs very slow. Perhaps I've been spoiled by smart phones and high speed but it has to load after every single selection. Turning it on? Loading...Signing on profile? Loading... Selecting an app? Loading... Exiting the app? Loading... Want to play a game? Loading...It's ridiculous. Then the \"games\" that you thought were included were going to be great...nope... I doubt my daughter is interested in playing with a calculator or calender. The only game that was included that she played with was the artstudio and it lagged a lot. You would draw something...lag...then it would come up. Sometimes it would just freeze. So much for a brand new product. I'll be returning this."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "We have a LP2 for one of our other children and decided to \"upgrade\" to the LPU. So far the LPU has been very disappointing:\n\n1. Load times - every time you open an app, close an app, return to the home screen, etc. it takes 10-18 seconds to load. The LP2 is twice as fast with an average of 5 sec load times. The LPU load times are so slow that often times, our child will get frustrated and click the home button again to go back and try to get something else to work before it evens loads.\n\n2. Wi-Fi - the load time for the Wi-Fi makes it almost unuseable. Imagine trying to load youtube videos with an old dial-up 16kb modem. We tried turning the Wi-Fi off to speed up load times for everything else but this did not improve performance. 30+ second load time for the Leap Search app\n\n3. Included apps - the advertised 11 apps with an $80 value is extremely misleading. Those 11 apps included: calendar, notepad for taking notes, calculator, clock, voice memo recorder, and others that no 4-9 year old would ever use. Just the most inexpensive thing they could possibly include and call it an app so they could market it as including 11 apps an $80 value. The only usable apps for a child are: pets, e-book, learning songs, and art studio. That's 4 apps, not 11. In fact, one of the apps requires an additional LPU in order to use. Complete ripoff.\n\n4. Price of additional apps - the 8GB of internal memory sounds impressive compared to the 4GB on the LP2. However, the only thing you would really use the room for is installing new apps. We liked this feature because it is easier for a kid to not have to install cartridges all the time without losing them or leaving them laying around the house all the time. However, most apps are $25. You can find those same games on black friday deals for $5. Of course, the prices for the apps will not be lower, only the cartridges. So if you're thinking about using the LPU for apps in place of cartridges be ready to fork out some significant cash.\n\n5. Stylus - the string is too short for the pen to ergonomically reach the opposite site of the leap pad.\n\n6. Weight - although having a larger screen size is a plus, the additional weight is very significant. A small child will not be able to hold the LPU in one hand while touching the screen with the other for very long. I tfells like it weighs at least double the LP2.\n\nOverall - stick to the LP2, the LPU is not worth the money.\n\nPros: larger screen\nCons: very slow processor (significantly slower than LP2), super slow Wi-Fi, terrible included apps, much heavier than LP2 (difficult for a child to handle), cost 50% more than LP2\n\nUpdate:\n\nAfter 2 months of use, the battery on a full charge only lasts 30 minutes."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "To be completely honest, we bought it for our 5 year old for Christmas...oops!...Santa gave it to her for Christmas. Her old Innotab was shot to pieces, as slow as an 80 year old crossing the street and didn't have near the options this one did. We were happy to make the switch given the optional space, the cameras, the video and wifi options, etc. The videos are kid friendly and she finds them hilarious.\n\nWe didn't expect it to dance or do tricks but just entertain her on trips to the store so it curbs the need for me to want to sell her to any passing stranger when she gets out of hand on rare occasions (apparently shock collars on children are still frowned upon).\n\nAnyway, it has a wide selection of apps to play with. If your child is not so great at keeping track of their games or ocd like mine and thinks everything needs to be clean so \"hey lets clean the cartridges in the sink\", I recommend you buy digital downloads of whatever games you like from the LP website. They have a wide variety that stores don't carry and they aren't very expensive.\n\nAll joking aside, my child loves it and gets a lot of use out of it regardless of how well we as parents like it. We did have a little trouble with it not turning on sometimes after charging it but ***if you hold down the power button and home button at the same time for 10 seconds*** it should fix the problem without resetting anything.\n\nAlso, check for naked pictures...kids are really sneaky...lesson learned. The only reason I give it 4 stars out of 5 is because it does have some known issues with turning on."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "Slow, outdated, JUNK.  The Leap Pad concept was a great one. However it is to modern childhood learning what a rotary phone is to making a call. The leap pad games are dated and the graphics look decades behind the times.  We bought it new AT $150.00 with 2 \"educational\" games at $25.00 each. The Leap pad is ABSURDLY SLOW and the touchscreen is abysmal for a 2-4 year old.  We then bought an older model iPad from Target for $200.00  Granted its a bit more expensive  BUT, you will MORE than make up for it saving on apps vs Leap pad games for it. We can buy educational apps from .99 cents and up. Average price is $2.99 and they are FAR superior to anything Leap Pad is offering.  Sorry but I would not recommend a leap pad to anybody. The iPad may be a bit more fragile but is worlds superior for educational early childhood learning. With literally 1000's of apps at the price of a cup of coffee it is 100X better than the Leap Pad."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "My daughter has only recently been able to start using the LeapPad Ultrawhereas she could easily navigate our iPad from an early age. So while the LeapPad Ultra has better games, music, eBooks, content in general for her age, it takes longer to switch from one thing to another, and the touch screen sensitivity is pretty subpar. I find this annoying since my 3yo can get easily frustrated, this is another thing that quickly and often frustrates her. For example, she will be touching the screen to open an app or click next on a page and it just won't work. I think she is over reacting and I go over to help her and I have the same difficulty. We try pressing softly, hard, to the side, in a different spot, everything. Only after multiple frustrating tries does it start to randomly work. I know that if you have your finger or any part of your hand on the screen, it will not recognize what you are trying to press; but in my previous example, there was nothing else touching the screen.\nAnother frustration with the system is the app center. I have purchased apps on my computer, phone, and tried on the LeapPadand every time I have had issues. Once it wouldn't let me send an email to reset my password even though I had entered my email. Another time, the LeapPad Connect wouldn't recognize and download the new apps onto the LeapPad that I had connected properlymultiple times.\nI have not used any tablet other than the IPad or the LeapPad, but I think ideally I would have waited to buy the LeapPad and done research to see if there was a tablet with a price point between the iPad and LeapPad that had the content of the LeapPad, but the technology and user friendliness of the iPadif that exists?"}

The problem is it takes way too long to boot up and start playing games. The screen is also too unresponsive and the games are too expensive. We ended up buying him a Kindle Fire HDX with a good case and he mostly uses that. I would not buy this again."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "Here are some frank thoughts after having heavily researched kid-friendly tablets, narrowed it down to the Nabi, Kindle Fire, and LeapPad Ultra, and having purchased and used the LeapPad Ultra for about a week.\n\nMy first piece of advice to parents would be to really figure out what your expectations are of a tablet. Are you looking for a tablet because it seems your child has commandeered your iPad and you really need it back? Do you want something for him to watch his favorite Netflix shows while you get some work done? Would you like him to be able to video chat with Grandma on his own more often? Does she need a tablet to get on the internet and do some research to complete homework assignments? Or, as was my case, are you looking for a \"back door\" way to sneak in more learning for your child while they are being entertained and at the same time gaining familiarity with using technology on their own on something that is exclusively theirs?\n\nOnce we figured out what we wanted to be able to do with the device, deciding on the LeapPad Ultra was easy. The second piece of advice, as already mentioned in other reviews, is that you should try to make your decision based on your child's needs and abilities currently, or maybe within the next year or two at most. Technology changes, needs change, who can say with certainty if in a few years your child will still be using whatever tablet you purchase now. So here are our pros and cons, keeping in mind that a \"con\" may not be a drawback if that is not what you are needing the device to do. We hope other parents find this useful:\n\nPros:\n- Well-designed educational apps. This is the main reason we purchased the LeapPad Ultra. Yes, the apps are expensive, but the quality is apparent. Like for a lot of parents, time is money, and I got tired of downloading various free or relatively inexpensive apps (on my iPad) for my child to try, only to find that the app mainly consisted of doing the same thing a hundred times ... touch the red balloon, yay! touch the green balloon, yay! Or finding entertaining apps my kids would gladly play for hours but with little educational value. Of course, there were a few exceptions, but with the LeapPad Ultra, you go to the store and a ton of apps are nicely organized by age, by subject matter, by delivery (i.e., game, interactive book, etc.) so you know what you are getting. And there are ways to reduce cost, like buying during one of their many sales, buying the $20 card on amazon, etc.\n- Large screen, clearly looks like a tablet. Out of the box, my kids automatically knew what it was and were delighted.\n- Styling is very attractive and kid-friendly\n- Stylus is included and tethered\n- Awesome battery life\n- Tablet talks to kids and provides instructions. Do they all do this? My kids figured out they had to be quiet and listen to the instructions. This was unexpected and very cool.\n- Front and back facing cameras, just like Mommy's iPad.\n- Pre-screened and approved websites and videos. They are primarily educational. Notably, this is a drawback for some. But for my 3 and 5 year olds, this all the internet/surfing experience I want them to have at this point.\n- I can ensure that the LeapPad is used as learning tool. We don't want it for movies, video conferencing, or general internet surfing. If they are on it, I know they are going to be engaged in some kind of interactive learning experience. Notably, you can purchase music and videos if this is something you want your child to have.\n- I bought two at once for the 3 and 5 year olds and am looking forward to the \"co-op\" apps they can work on together.\n- You can use cartridges or download apps. The app purchasing experience is actually very easy (thanks LeapFrog, heh) and they drop right onto your device over WiFi. We have two Ultras and the apps we purchased automatically dropped onto each kid's LeapPad. I have heard that getting second hand game cartridges helps to keep costs down.\n\nCons\n- No true internet search capability\n- Video quality and interface are not like an actual tablet, i.e., a little grainy, not totally smooth. I believe this is marketed as an \"educational toy\" and the quality is consistent with this. To my kids, however, everything looks great.\n- Camera quality as above. Again, my kids are overjoyed with each having their own camera and recorder. But of course the quality is more \"toy\" like.\n- You must wait for apps to load and for the home screen to appear. The LeapPad \"thinks\" a lot. And slowly. I knew this going in so I didn't expect it to have a full-on lightening fast processor like the Nabi or Kindle Fire. But it is turning out to be a good opportunity to teach to kids to wait, patiently, and not jab at the screen or home button while the LeapPad \"thinks.\"\n- Glitchiness, for lack of a better word. Once or twice the LeapPad does not autorotate when it should. Yesterday the apps were all shifted over about a inch from where they should have been. I saw weird lines at the bottom of the screen for about 2 seconds and then it fixed itself. The other issues were fixed by pressing the home button. For now, just a minor inconvenience. But does it worry me? Absolutely, because of ...\n- The customer service. I read the reviews from others about LeapFrog's CS and wanted to think that perhaps those people had usually bad experiences. Unfortunately, I did have to interact with their CS already and the experience left me worried. Very worried.  Although I did get a response within 12 hours, the person responding clearly had not read my email, because the problem I had reported (the device got stuck on the download screen and then shut off automatically before getting to the start up menu) could not have possibly been fixed by their solution (select the parent option at the start up menu). Luckily, the problem was my fault through impatience (the first set-up it took overnight to complete the update process but then was ready to go by the next morning).\n- It comes with some free apps, but once you dive in, it does not feel like a lot. For example, you go to the virtual bookcase and it is empty until you buy a book to put there. It seems they could throw in a free book, especially as it is marketed as an educational toy.\n- The \"expiration date\" factor.  I can foresee that once they have outgrown the LeapPad apps, we will have zero use for this device. Unlike the Kindle or even Nabi2 which, through parent mode, can be used for a long time yet to watch movies, download regular apps and books, get on a real internet browser, etc.\n- Cost. The LeapPad experience is not cheap. We purchased two Ultras for $129 each from amazon with their promotional credit deal. Then we got two of the extra tough covers for $25 each. And we also got the shields for the screens for $12. Then you need to purchase additional games and books which can be as high as $25 for a game. It adds up.\n\nThe bottom line is that I got the LeapPad Ultra for the LeapFrog learning apps. They are high quality and provide my kids with another way to learn in addition to the flash cards and workbooks we already do. Plus, they get to practice using technology themselves in a safe environment."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "We purchased TWO LeapPad ultra bundles from Amazon last November, for both our kids to receive from Santa this past Christmas.  We purchased the LPU, the Leapfrog brand headphones, the protective skins, and the cases.  It was NOT cheap, but I heard great things about the product.  Right off the bat there were a few issues, but they were resolved once we downloaded the Connect program to use without computer.  However, just a few days ago (it's now June...so 6 months after he received it) my son told me he could not hear the sound on his LPU.  He handed it to me, and I pulled out the headphone pin out of the headphone jack- it was broken in half- horizontally, not vertically.  The broken piece is still inside, and is so far down that you can't get anything in there to pull it out.  Of course, the LPU still thinks the headphones are plugged in, and now won't play any sound.  So, we essentially have a toy that we spent well over $200 for (if you could the case, skin, headphones, 3 cartridges, and at least 6 games we downloaded from the App store)....that we can no longer use.  I spoke with customer service on the phone today, and the lady told me that they had looked into it, and that it was no covered under manufacturer's warranty.  Well, I assure you- there is no way we caused this break, and I find it despicable that this company will not stand by their product.  Now, with one child who has a LPU that works, and one child without- I'm certainly not giving them any more of my money, and I will tell any other parent who listens how Leapfrog did NOT make this right."}

The first problem was that your system rejected her credit card the entire \"buy within 2 hours to receive 30% off\" period.\nI called. They said she had a different name from mine and she needed to call to add her information to the billing information. She called and did this, I was to receive an email within an hour confirming this had been done. 3 hours later, I had no email but attempted to purchase the apps through the leappad as instructed.\nThere was no billing information on the account. It rejected MY credit card. I called again. They claimed all the errors were due to the CVV number being wrong. Neither of us have EVER had a problem with this on any other online purchases, anywhere. They told me to try again, as I finally received that first email confirming the billing changes were made.\nAgain, the leapfrog account showed NO billing information in it's records. I tried putting my mother's credit card and mine into the account information and directly into the checkout page. Again nothing but errors.\nCalled again and was rudely told it was on our end and asked had we checked the bank. Again we told them we had never had trouble with our CVV numbers.\nThe rep offered to send a report \"to determine if the error was on our end or theirs\". He told me it would be Monday before we heard back from them. Keep in mind the 30% offer is only good the first day of registration. Keep in mind I have a 4 year old and a 6 year old that will be super excited to have their own tablet but nothing (other than 3 simple apps) to do with it until Monday. I HAVE TO DEAL WITH THEIR DISAPPOINTMENT.\nThe rep was kind enough to supposedly add a note so that we will eventually get our 30% off, only after I insisted.\nMy mother called back. There were no supervisors available (naturally). The most she could get out of their indifference was to put a rush on the request. Supposedly we will hear from them this evening instead of Monday. Considering how long the 1 hour email took, I am not holding my breath.\nWe have already decided that if this situation is not corrected quickly, we will return your product and proceed to spread the word to all of our friend and social networks. It seems ridiculous that your company would disappoint children and cause this much trouble just to RECEIVE money.\n\n5/2/14 : so far they tell me they are 'looking into why my mother's card won't work' and gave me a 20% off coupon for future purchases... not sure how to use it since I can freaking make a first purchase... Also no mention on why MY card won't work on their system. No mention on customer service's indifference to our problem.\n\n5/3/14 : No word. The 30% off offer is no longer showing on our cart. My CC is still not being accepted. My children still don't have the apps they were promised to play and learn with. I am SO upset with Leap Frog.\n\n5/6/14: Another email from them. They claim that my mother's information has been updated in the billing system. The stupid thing still won't accept either of our cards to pay with and the 30% off deal is expired. I am thinking that both of the introductory deals are scams at this point. Buy apps within the first 2 hour (or day) and get 30% off!!!! Ha ha, you can't make a purchase."}

The other has numerous dings in the screen from the stylus that is part of the product.  Additionally, this LeapPad is used by a girl who is very careful with things.  When we contacted LeapPad they informed us that they do not repair the screen.  To put a product on the market for children that is this fragile and not have a means to repair it is inexcusable."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "We purchased this for our son for Christmas 2013 and started regretting it shortly after. The device is a great concept with poor execution. When we started to set up the Ultra, it automatically downloaded apps from the previous Leap Pad. It would have been nice to have the opportunity to decide which apps we wanted to download and which ones we did not want to download. Felt like it took a year to download them all. Finally got it working, but at times the device would run slower than molasses during a winter vortex. My wife purchased new apps recently that my son can't even use because the Ultra is too full. But it is not allowing her to delete the apps. So, I decided to install the LeapFrog app on my computer - thinking it would speed things along for setting up and managing the Ultra. NOT! After taking what felt like a century to download the apps, now the Ultra is \"syncing\". Started last night around 9:00 PM.  Want to know what the percentage was when I got up at 6:00 AM this morning to check? 15%. In the meantime, the Ultra will probably die from battery starvation, and I will have to begin the syncing process all over again.  Complete waste of time and money. Not to mention that the tablet is so big, even Hagrid from Harry Potter would probably gawk if he saw it."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "I bought this for my son for Christmas 2013. I bought him the leappad 2 for Christmas the previous year and he liked it for the most part. But once I saw the LPU and all of the wonderful features they advertise such as kid safe Wi-Fi, more apps, bigger screen etc. I knew that I wanted to get him this instead. This device is worse than the LeapPad2! Such a huge disappointment! When I purchased the LeapPad2 I had to exchange it only a week after I got it due to it crashing continuously. The second one I got worked better but it would still freeze a lot and we could never get it to turn off. You actually had to open up the back and take the batteries out for it to turn off. Anyway, so when I got the LPU I thought that leapfrog had made some great improvements and that I would finally have a tablet that my son would love. Boy was I wrong! This device is so ridiculously slow that my son just gets frustrated and wants to play with my iPad or my iPhone. The Wi-Fi is a complete joke. The device freezes constantly and apps crash repeatedly. The download process takes for ever! I just downloaded a video for him for $7.50 and it took ONE HOUR!! Seriously?! I can download an entire movie for my son in a matter of seconds on my iPad. It's not even worth my money at this point! He kept asking me over and over is my video done yet? Is my video done yet? And I just kept saying no, not yet. No not yet....ugh! Plus the apps are ridiculously expensive! I can download so many wonderful, educational and fun games on my iPad and they are either free or only cost a couple of dollars. Oh, and it only takes about a minute to download instead of HOURS. No wonder he prefers to play my device instead of his. Unfortunately, during our renovation process upstairs my husband accidentally threw out the box for the device which had the receipt in it. So now I'm stuck with a device that my son doesn't want to play with and hundreds of dollars that I have wasted on apps for something that doesn't work."}

She does not throw it, dunk it in water, step on it etc. and very shortly after she received it, it started getting very faint \"scratch\" marks behind the outer screen.  No big deal, whatever.  Then, it slid off the couch (6 inch drop onto plush carpeting) and this huge black mark appeared from one side of the screen to the other.  She continued to use it for another month until she really started to complain about it.  I purchased a warranty for it when I bought it.  Little did I know, the warranty only covers defects.  Leapfrog does not offer an accident warranty for the device UNLESS you purchase the device from Leapfrog.com.  I went back to the store when I purchased it and luckily they replaced the device but clearly advised me that any warranty I buy will not cover accidents.  We had the device for literally 2 days with a leapfrog rubber \"protector\" on it and it is kept in leapfrogs Monsters INC. backpack when not in use, the screen is shattered from one corner to the other.  I am livid.  This tablet is not cheap and neither are the \"games\".  I am a single mother!! if my child was not so happy with this device I would be leaving it behind for good.  Unfortunately I have purchased yet another Ultra!!  From the website.  The Ultra is for 3-9 year old children but is no way near tough enough for a 3 year old.  My child is gentle and we are now on our 3rd one in less than 4 months! I am disgusted and outraged with Leapfrog.  The device itself is HEAVY!!!! I don't even understand how a child's \"tablet\" is so heavy.  why???  My tablet was $89 and can do waaaay more then her Leap pad Ultra and weighs 1/10 the amount hers does.

The processor on the device is extremely slow and you have to really touch the screen for it to recognize your input.  The price of the games are much more expensive than compatible apps through Google Play or the App Store.  After a few games you would break even on the price difference between devices.  You also can't load your own mp3's to the device, you have to buy songs in their format from the leap frog store.  The screen resolution is also sub par.

When we looked at it a month after he got it, it was full of pictures that he had been taking! It's very kid friendly, and very easy for them to use.  The ability to add games from the LeapFrog website, as well as actual game cartridges makes it a smart purchase and very flexible.  The games vary for ages 3 and up.

When we recieved the leap pad Ultra it was a little slow, after loading the updates it picked up speed.  We had purchased the carrying case and protective skin that amazon sells.  I have to say that my youngest brought the pad outside and placed it by the front door to play with the garden hose while we got ready to get into the car to drop off big brother at preschool.  I did not realize he had left it there, and assumed he had it in his little carrying case for it which he did bring into the car.  It was outside on our front door for over seven hours, where it was exposed to a severe thunderstorm that hit our area, it rained so much that the street flooded.  My husband came home from work and found it wet! There was water from the rain over the screen, he sent me a picture of it and I thought it was ruined.  (I was surprised that no one took it from the door at plain sight, I love my neighborhood.)  Let me tell you, we dried it off and made sure that there was no water left on the device, and it turned on.  Nothing happened to this little pad, absolutely nothing!  I was amazed and impressed by the quality of this product, LeapFrog did a very good job in designing this product and its resistance threshold.  My boys love the Ultra leap pad, they always play on it and enjoy all the available activites preloaded on the device.  They also enjoy making videos and taking pictures, we are very happy with the leap pad and believe it has been a great learning experience for my boys who are 5 and 3.5.  Like I said the product is very sturdy, the youngest has flung it a few times and nothing has happened to it, I am sure the little skin we bought it has increased its durability.\n\nPros:\nDurable, resistant, well designed.\nGreat educational games that engage a childs curiousity while making learning fun.\nGreat apps and activites that engage in a childs imagination.\nFun Camera and video.\nTouch screen is very responsive and easy for little fingers.\nBattery life is decent.\nFeels good in both kids hands and parents hands.\n\nCons:\nTakes about 3.5 hours to charge.\nThe OS when you start it up can take almost a minute.\nA bigger library of games in cartridges (I know there are more games online that you can download, but we like the physical cartridges)\n\nHope this helps anyone who is considering to buy this product."}

The games are terribly expensive, and a lot of the \"apps\" in the app store are just $10 cartoon videos that are 35mins long.  Think about that, you are paying $10 for a 35 minute episode of a educational show that is not even based on popular (licensed) characters in some cases.  That's like paying $10 to watch an episode of sesame street.  Compare that to $8/month for Netflix and watch all of the educational cartoons you want, and it's an epic waste of money.\n\nNow a couple of positive comments.\n- There are a few really good and clever games that are genuinely better than what you can get for iOS (for the purposes of education).  Some games are long, in depth and have rich reward systems that encourage your kid to figure out the challenge presented.  This was why I bought the device in the first place.  It's really the only saving grace for it.  However, if these were available for a real tablet, I would ditch the Leappad in a heartbeat.\n- It's durable, I guess.  That said, we have a kid case on our iPad that feels just a strong.\n- The built in stylus is good for teaching writing skills.\n\nBuyer beware parents.  We all want to use our kid's playtime to help them get ahead and this is the point of devices like the Leappad.  I'm just not sure the return on this one is worth the investment and I've irritated with some of the advertised features that are lacking in reality."}

I think we should have just payed a little more and gotten him a Kindle Fire or the like.  It doesn't come with many games though they advertise it that it comes with 11 apps.  Those include things like the camera and a drawing feature.  He likes playing the free games we have for our daughters tablets.  It's hard to get him excited about his when they're playing theirs.  The games for this are not cheap (mostly $10 each).  The first game I bought for him, it took 3 adults (2 with their Master's...though not in computers), and about an hour and a half to figure it out.  I downloaded it and it didn't come with clear instructions on how to play the game.  So, of course, my son got tired of waiting and tried to get his sister to let him play with her tablet. Considering getting rid of it....if only we could find it!"}

This review, however, is about the hardware. The LeapPad2 stopped charging on January 10. Leapfrog customer service has been very slow to respond and the tablet is still broken. I just purchased 3 cartridges for the Ultra. None of them work. This is the first time we have attempted to use a cartridge in the Ultra. I wrote to Leapfrog customer service again five days and have received no response. That's probably because of my complaint telling them I'm quite disgusted to have two new tablets neither of which is working properly and it's been exasperating having to deal with them."}

My mother-in-law bought it for my daughter as a Christmas present, but I looked at it and thought it would be nice for her.  The apps that come with the LeapPad are pretty lame.  My daughter (3) got bored with them quickly so I went online to download some games for her.  That's when the shock set in.  The games are expensive. They are the same cost as buying a cartridge game would be which to me seems steep.  They do run sales every once in a while, but it's nothing spectacular.  I was really expecting a little more out of the LeapPad Ultra- especially with the camera and whatnot.  You can't download Netflix or Skype or anything like that.  I think you can download movies and music but it all has to be from LeapFrog.  It's kind of annoying. That being said, my daughter does really like it.  She gets very excited about playing on her LeapPad and learning new things that it can do. I do feel that the games that I put on it are helping her learn her letters and numbers.  I wouldn't buy this again and in hindsight would recommend it as a gift either. To me, the cost just isn't worth it when there are so many free games to play online at Nick Jr. or Disney Jr., etc."}

But the upside was that the LeapPad interface did all the work for me and I didn't have to log in and out or turn the pad off and on multiple times in order for the downloads and updates to work.\n\nMy child loves the web videos that are easily categorized and screened by the manufacturer. The parental controls are easy to set up and work well. The new included recharge kit is great, battery life on the Ultra is a bit better than the LeapPad 2 but it doesn't have the same auto shut off feature if it is left alone and untouched for several minutes.\n\nOur first purchase of the LeapPad Ultra resulted in a defect in the screen from the manufacturer. Two days after purchase the screen developed horizontal lines and refused to flip from vertical to horizontal views. We returned it for a full refund from the excellent seller here on Amazon. The replacement we have had no problems with."}

I received my replacement Ultra.  So far so good.  I hope this one last longer then 2 months.  I added 1 more star since LeapFrog did provide the new Ultra as promised.

At that time, the reviews here were good, that it was a study product and interesting for 4 year olds.  At first, it was.

She hasn't dropped it. Tonight we turned it on, however it froze on the profile screen and was unresponsive to touch.  Ok, so I thought, I'll just restart it.  So I proceeded to do that...and guess what?  It no longer turns on!  Even when its plugged into the wall and the orange charging light is on.  I am beyond disappointed.

I like the Video search feature geared just for kids, unlike youtube which who knows what your child might watch. The screen is bright and clear, battery life is fantastic, and I like how it shutsdown on its own if its not used.\n\nCons: Slow Slow Slow, Boy is this thing slow! It crawls at a snails pace at anything you do. Sometimes I have to press multiple times just to get it to register. You would think that they could at least make it a little bit faster considering how much you pay for it. The Apps Store just plain SUCKS! There are no free apps, and the cheapest apps cost about $5 which doesn't get you much. We have an iPad and my child still insists on using it over the Leappad. Please LEAPFROG, if your apps are junk at least give us access to more free ones.\n\nIf I had to make the decision again I would have purchased something else.

There are a lot of things I could say about it, slow, apps cost toooo much etc etc. but the bottom line for me is, if you want a pad with free games, apps, learning tools, internet, camera...the Kindle Fire beat this hands down, straight up-no chaser. PERIOD. I am sending back to purchase her a Kindle Fire, only logical solution right!"}

In full disclosure-I believe it had been dropped at some point BUT it was working after that, AND if a product designed for 5 year olds can't handle that then, well.....Contacted LP and they said to pack it up and return it for testing. We did so. We packed everything up in the original packaging and including the email regarding the incident and the fact that at one point it turned back on again only to turn itself off. I call last week to check on the status and they said they would get back to me. I received an email saying it had been tested (not fixed) and was working fine. Came home Friday evening to a box from UPS, all that was inside was the LP itself wrapped in bubble wrap, no USB cable, or charger, NOTHING. I finally realize I can charge it with our LP2 cable and do so. Works fine for awhile then keeps shutting itself off. Saturday morning, fully charged, it turns off again and doesn't turn back on. Of course I tried contacting LF on why they had sent it back without anything, but had to send an email ( which actually has yet to be responded to ) because customer service closes at 3PM Friday-Monday. We just want a product that works. So I call Monday. AND today. All they can tell me is that it worked when they tested it and if a product works they won't replace it. So we need to send it back AGAIN?! Problem is, it doesn't work, I keep getting the run around and no one can tell me WHY it was sent back they way it was. I tried explaining to the various representatives that I just want a new one, that I don't trust them to \"fix\" after the last time AND the way it was sent back. My poor daughter has been without her big gift from Santa :( I would actually return the damn thing if I could. This doesn't seem like a company that respects the customer or stands by their product."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "This was a gift for our nearly 4 year old son.  He previously had a Leap Pad 2, which he used for about a year, before passing it down to his 22 month old sister.  I was excited to get him the Ultra, thinking it would be a step up from the Leap Pad 2, and I was slightly disappointed.  The main complaints:\n\n-Upon opening the box, I hooked it up to my computer to download the games that we had already purchased for the LP2.  Due to a glitch of some kind, it was taking over an hour per game (and we have over 20 games).  I contacted the company and was told to delete the Leap Pad Connector app on my computer, then download it again.  I did, but the games it held previously now had to be downloaded again as well, and it took me about 4 hours to do so.  The Leap Pad app had previously worked fine with our LP2.\n\n-The LP 2 has arrows onscreen that you tap to change screen, while on the Ultra you \"swipe\" the screen.  This would be fine, except with the way the app icons are laid out on the screen and the lack of accuracy of the stylus, there is no room to touch the screen without accidentally opening an app.  Even I have trouble doing it.\n\n- As mentioned above, the touchscreen is not as accurate as the LP 2, and neither the stylus nor touching it with a finger can always give the intended result.  In the \"Doc McStuffins\" game in particular this is maddening for my son, because it requires more accuracy with the stylus than the touchscreen actually seems capable of giving.  He starts to get frustrated, calls me to help him, and then I try 15-20 times to move something or pick something up with the stylus, and eventually tell him to just play a different game.\n\nThe only feature I really think was an improvement in the Ultra is that there is more memory, which means more room for apps.  Our son finds using the Ultra frustrating and time consuming and is constantly asking for help, while in comparison, his 22 month old sister picked up the LP2 and was able to properly use it within a day, without any adult help.\n\nOverall, I wish I had bought him an adult tablet like a Kindle as his next step up from a LP2.\n\nUPDATE 5/2014\n\nSo I continued to have problems with the LeapPad Connect program and this device.  Any time I wanted to add an app, I had to contact customer service and tell them it was taking hours to do so.  I was tired of having to download my \"activity logs\" from my computer and send them to customer service just so they could figure out what was happening.  This LeapPad now sits gathering dust in a drawer.  We saved up and waited for a sale to buy the kids an iPad mini instead."}

Where the hell are free apps. We get a few stupid free apps when we purchased this device and my daughter who is 4 barely pics up the device. We are seeing a whole lot of sports videos...and adult crap when we go to view videos etc....what the hell is a 4 year old from the caribbean doing watching ice freaking hockey etc...

Even the 'educational' apps are junk compared to 'educational' apps on the android and apple market. I spent 50$ on I think 5 apps (one app was 25$) and even those apps are not great. One of the included apps is a \"chat\" app... they use short words like \"brb\" in a chat window. If this is \"educational\", this upcoming generation is doomed. I recieved as gift, and personally it is not worth more than the 50$ I spent on apps already. Each time he asks for it I try to get him to use starfall.com or the android tablet that has much more eductional games (most were free). It is nice to know he cant buy anything on the tablet or see some adult sites, but I think the mind-numbing games might be just as bad. I would rather take  a chance on my kid purchasing a 2.99$  app by accident than spending 50$ on apps upfront.\nAnother thing - you cant move app location, all included apps are on home screen, so even though I paid for \"okay\" apps, he gets stuck in the camera, chat, and pet app...

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "I got the Ultra for my 5 year old and the Leap Pad 2 for my 3 year old for Christmas. So far the 2 operates a lot more smoothly than the Ultra. We keep having weird issues with the Ultra, for one, my son scrambled up the letters in his name at the top of the screen (which the voice prompts him to make changes to every time he's on the home screen, would be helpful if that guy would go away!!) and whenever I try to fix it it says something to the effect of \"that name is already in use, please try another\". What?? I just want to correct the spelling of his account name and it won't let me. Then, last night, EVERYTHING on the device disappeared from his home screen. I went on to the parental settings and saw in the content manager that it was re-downloading everything on it for some reason. I let it do it's thing for a while and it looked like it was working fine, everything started slowly showing up again. Then this morning he goes to use it and only about half of his things are there. Just his games and art studio. His pet pad is gone, all the \"in-device\", pre loaded things are gone (like notepad, calculator, etc) and everything that is still there has a generic name given to it. What the hell happened?? I want to smash it, seriously. The Pet Pad was one of his favorite things on there.\nWe've also had issues with the touch screen either not responding at all or being WAY over sensitive. Not to mention how long it takes certain things to load. Maybe I just got a defective one but the whole thing has been a giant frustration from the start. The LeapPad 2 has been much better."}

My twin four year old boys' brains move way faster than this can keep up.  Might have been better to have gotten some Kindle Fires and used parental controls.  Perhaps they didn't want kids using a device with a glass screen as needed for capacitive touch, but what can explain the dragging processor speeds?

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "I bought this tablet as a Christmas gift for my 3 year old (actually almost 4) and a Kindle for my 5 year old. Yes, she definitely liked it. No doubt about it. But as I was afraid she loved her sister's Kindle...\n\nOK, let's see... The LeapPad is louder than the Kindle. Oh, it's also more colorful than the Kindle. It's more \"educational\" than the Kindle. Well, I can keep going but I think you got the picture.\n\nNow, a few weeks after seeing the kids engaging with both devices I just want to share my thoughts with other parents and how I feel about my decision. And basically all I have to say I think this thing has more cons than pros. For instance:\n\n- The apps are ridiculously expensive. LeapFrog does promotions all the time but still the apps are very expensive. There's no such thing as a single digit app. Everything is expensive. I bought 3 Disney games averaging $20/each.\n- The device is slow. Period. Kids have even less patience than adults. And everything here takes a while to load. If you get too anxious and keep clicking and touching it just make things worse. It kinda hangs or slows down even more.\n- This thing is heavy. I thought my iPad 3 was heavy. This is heavier. Hello!?!??! This is for kids!!!! It's heavier than all previous LeapFrog products we owned (Leapster, Leapster 2, etc).\n\nTo summarize, it's OK. I really like LeapFrog products, I think they have a lot of value in terms of education. But I think this device could be a lot better than it actually is.\n\nMy suggestion? Go to a B&M store and have your kid play with it if possible... And then do the same - play with it for a few minutes. In my opinion a Kindle HD 7 inch is a much better deal and it gives you a decent mix of games and educational stuff and I wish I had bought 2 of them instead. I hope LeapFrog start making more apps for IOS and start doing Android devices as well. I would rather buy their apps for other platforms than for their own... Unfortunately...\n\nWell, these are my two cents... Good luck!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "Got this for Christmas for my 3 year old (will be 3 1/2 in April.)  He is officially obsessed! I mean to the point where he carries this thing everywhere and I have actually started rationing his time with it.  It is the perfect leap pad for a toddler.  Super super easy to figure out.  I charged it and set everything up before Christmas for him and it only took me like 10 minutes to completely set up for him and his little brother.  They each have profiles set up and the parent view is easy to access as well to make purchases and tweak different settings.  I thought it would be painfully slow to do anything since it is a kid's tablet.  But to my surprise it wasn't. He never gets frustrated when switching to another app and it really didn't take too long to download games from the app store either.  I just went to the parent view, unlocked, shopped for games, downloaded and put the tablet up for 1/2 hr or so while sit downloaded and came back and everything was done.  This is a sturdy tablet.  It has been dropped, stepped on, juice spilled on it, it's still going.  I like that it has a \"pen\" that is attached to it with a special slot for it so he can draw and manipulate the screen.  There are tons of songs and videos he can watch and what's best is they are all positive and educational.  Not like on youtube where everything has to be screened.  He played with my kindle fire all of the time before and now has forgotten all about it.  He loves his little tablet.  As for the pictures-- are they the highest quality?  No.  But they're good enough for him.  Sometimes come out grainy but often times the pictures look pretty good.  It comes with a few apps that you choose and then you have to buy more.  My only gripe is apps are expensive for this.  As in like $20 each.  But they are more involved then some silly app I get on my phone for free to keep him entertained for all of 10 minutes.  He could play with this for hours if I let him.  I'm very pleased with the purchase and would recommend to anyone with kids aged 18 months up to kindergarten age at least."}

Kept them preoccupied for most of the drive to and from, and restaurant outings were a breeze.  Highly recommend headphones for car trips so parents can have peace while kids play on.\n\nOur oldest had the original Leappad which she could never play because our younger child would literally beat her up to get his hands on it.  So it is great that each has their own now.  The larger display and faster processor is very nice.  Love it that it connects wirelessly for updates because connecting via USB was cumbersome.  Bright idea to tether the stylus to the device.  Kids love the front and rear camera.  They enjoy playing tic tac toe together wirelessly.  But for me, the best is that it now has a built in lithium battery.  I despised having to charge, replace, and recharge those rechargeable batteries!  Yay, so happy that is a thing of the past!!\n\nWe considered getting them iPad mini's, but we would be so upset if they broke them!  The Leappad is a durable kid tablet.  Also, its nice that they can't visit any old website.  A few months ago I noticed pop up advertisements for American Horror Story coming up as my three year old watched Lightening McQueen videos on Youtube on our iPad.  Needless to say, I was mortified!  Additionally, as nice as it is that there are so many free games out there for the iPad, kids get so confused and frustrated at the locked features/areas that can only be unlocked by purchasing or the pop up ads for other recommended games.  We ended up with loads of useless games the kids accidentally installed and charges for accidentally purchased games when we forgot to lockdown our iPad.\n\nI absolutely love the content Leappad develops.  The kids love the recognizable characters the games are based on.  Best of all, they really learn stuff and they think learning is fun!  Whenever my daughter spouts out a new fact about something, like the sun is a star or killer whales can eat sharks, she says she learned it from her Leappad.  The games are pricey at retail price, but during the holidays most of them go on sale.  I picked up several at $9.99 and the My Little Pony game at $6.99 this year!  Just stock up then and give out for good grades or improved behavior throughout the year.\n\nThe Zui search engine is not like the ones on a computer.  It is category based like music, animals, science, etc with no way to type in a web address or search outside of the designated categories.  So it is very secure and limited.\n\nSo overall, we really like our decision to stick with Leappad.  It makes sense for us and our kids right now."}

I thought this would be a good starter without the hefty price tag. I might as well have bought her the iPad or similar device though. Compared to a full blown tablet the LeapPad programs are VERY expensive. The cheapest programs for the LeapPad are about $5, and their are relatively few of them available. Most of the programs, in fact the vast majority, are $10. Compare that now to the cost of children's educational programs for an iOS device that are between free and 1 or 2 bucks, and the value of this product washes away pretty quick. Its extremely... sometimes painfully slow too. The device comes with about 10 or 12 programs but my 7 year old was board with those after a couple of hours; she spends most of the time now playing with the camera, which has pretty poor resolution. All things aside except for the cost of the programs, the iPad or similar device is a MUCH better value. When you add the comparison of speed, camera and screen resolution, the LeapPad is simply a waste of money."}

The OS is SOOO slow that it lost her interest before games and apps even loaded.  Games are ridiculously expensive (20-25$) and honestly not very fun.  It came loaded with some apps that she wasn't interested in anyways.  The camera was slow and had some features that I couldn't even figure out or enjoy.

(NickJr, Treehouse etc..) that being said it allows the company to charge $30 for a game that can be had on other platforms for $10 and hold a gun to the head of the parents by not allowing parent approved web links. Talk about taking away consumer and parental choices in a product this is it.  All said the $99 ClickN KIDS Family Tablet ANDROID BASED is 400% better performance, better graphics controls, wifi etc.. 30 pre-loaded apps including Looney Tunes Phonics, Talking Tom 2 and Talking Ginger, Diversion, Team Awesome and more. Your ClickN KIDS Tablet comes with the best parental controls available today with web content filtering, built-in monitoring and controls that let you protect your child's identity, monitor their time usage and even prevent your child from downloading new apps and performing other functions that can cost you money. The grownups section offers everything you need from a full-featured tablet. Simply tap on the grownups button, type in your secure pin number and you're in.\n\nThe LeapPad Ultra is like a schoolyard drug dealer saying here have this it will make you feel good and wham once in the kid is trapped accept in this case it is the parent stranded and held hostage by design of the product which leave users at the wim of the company and where they want to go with it.  How much can parents save by allowing there kids to play free games from many websites that are no accessible with the LeapPad Ultra. Sadly they are forced to pay for once sucked into the drug."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "Bought this for our 2 year old daughter for Christmas over much debate vs an iPad. At $160 it sounded great compared to the $500-$600 for the iPad air so we bought in.\n\nOverall the tablet seemed somewhat rugged out of the packaging but it's rubber looking housing is actually just plastic. Setup took about an hour with all of the required updates and registration. We set our parental controls which was more work to use to access the App Store then we anticipated.\n\nThe free game/app included was very \"low budget\". We expected it \"the ultra\" to have a few more bells and whistles out of the box. For example, the camera quality is not great nor is the processing power as we experienced delays when using functions as simple as the art studio. Although the sensitivity of the ultra was said to be far better then the leap pad 2 when we read in reviews, it still seemed way too unresponsive to the stylus than we would want.\n\nThe biggest disappointment and primary reason we returned this product was the price of games and apps. The cheapest we saw for our daughters age was a discounted bundle pack that cost $40 for 4 apps. Most apps/games were priced at $25 each for the newer ones. You buy a couple of games/apps on the ultra and before you know it you paid more for a kid only tablet than an iPad full of better 99 cent apps.  One other disappointment was the newly added wifi that constantly kept disconnecting (was not the wifi itself as all of our other household products worked).\n\nAmazon was great at taking back the returned tablet and issuing our refund extremely fast. We will now purchase an iPad for our daughter  which we can all use in our household, will purchase a durable case, a bunch of apps that will still come out cheaper in the end. Our only challenge will be monitoring constantly on the internet with an iPad as content issues may occur when she gets older. As others reviewers have said, I can easily see the leap pad ultra being another toy in the bottom of the toy box.\n\nThe Ultra may be a good fit for your household but vs the iPad we feel it is apples to oranges when it comes to educating and ease of use for our daughter."}

He received the LP Ultra for Christmas and navigates around like a pro. It is easy to use, yet durable and parent friendly as well.\nThe only negative thing I have to say is that the downloadable apps are fairly expensive to me, thus the reason for the 4 star rating. The cheapest app I've found whether it is a game, book, music, ect is $5 and go up as high as $25 for just one download. Leap Frog does offer discount codes when you are purchasing an app which is helpful, but you have to buy more than one at a time to qualify for the discount. They also offer bundles, which does save some money, but you have to be prepared to spend anywhere from $40-$120 per those bundles."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "My 3 year old received a LeapFrog Ultra for Christmas and absolutely loves having his own \"cumpuper.\"  I am pleased with the gift but I can't recommend it for my friends kids until LeapFrog fixes a massive feature gap.\n\nPros\n-The device is responsive and seems tough enough.\n-My 3 year old enjoys the basic games as well as the one cartridge we have.  I especially like how the skill level increases automatically.\n-The interface seems intuitive and my son could easily navigate it without any more training than showing him the power button\n\nCons\n-The screen is not as sensitive as I would like but I suspect it is a trade-off for added durability\n-It was very difficult to upgrade the firmware when I first unpacked it.  The poor explanation text made me think the device had bricked itself when it downloaded the update after I connected the wifi.\n-The parental control interface was not obvious and I am STILL not certain what some of the options mean.\n-I have not found a way to turn off the 'guest' account.\n\n**MAJOR** Function over-site\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends limiting exposure of ALL media to 2 hours per day or less.\n([...]\n\n**It is currently IMPOSSIBLE to electronically enforce a usage limit on the leapfrog Ultra.** (verified through LeapFrog tech support\n\nWhile I can (and do) take away the device, my son is too young to really understand the reasoning and assumes he is being punished.  I have timeout functions set up on my smartphone, TV and internet which he does understand.  Why can't the Leapfrog provide what several dozen free Android software's offer?  This is a very simple feature to implement.\n\nAt this time I can not recommend the LeapFrog Ultra.  I view this gap as almost as dangerous to my child as an uncontrolled WiFi.  Implement a daily time limit and you will have my enthusiastic endorsement.\n\nIf LeapFrog reads this review than I suggest the following functions in order of preference:\n\n1. An overall daily time limit.  This resets every day at midnight.  Once the time limit is reached it automatically logs out the child and refuses to allow the child or guest account to log in.  It would be nice to allow an easy interface for the parent to extend the time (ex. the timeout notice provides a place to type in the pin and then select 10, 30, 60 min)\n\n2. Black-out times.  Allow me to prevent him from logging in before 7:30 AM and after 8 PM on weekdays but with a different schedule for weekends. (providing granularity to a the 30 minute level would be sufficient).  This will help preserve bed-time and other structured scheduled times.\n\n3. Allow a per-app daily limit.  Say I have several different apps but I don't want him only playing his Thomas game.  I set a 30 min limit on Thomas but no limit for math flashcards.  This should be applicable to all downloaded apps as well as any cartridge games the device has been exposed to in the past."}

For example, the Leap Search feature leads her to websites like PBS that displays dozens of fun games like Caillou, Curious George, etc.  She can see the links to all of the games, but can't play them??!!  This is because of the Leap Pad approved sites which I totally understand is a safety feature....but these are SAFE sites??  And these sites are accessible through the Leap Pad!!  Why on earth would they create a product that leads a child to a fun looking site but does not allow the child to participate on that site other than reading a few things or looking at a few pictures.  My daughter sees these super fun games but is unable to access them???  What is the point?  To torture young kids?  It's like dangling a juicy steak in front of my husband but not allowing him to eat it!!  Ridiculous and wow, what a rip off!!  Of course you can easily purchase aps on the Leap Pad site but they cost up to $25.00!!  And no free ones to be found..............she could have more fun playing on my smart phone.....for free................"}

I am hoping they both get a few years of use with all the age appropriate apps that can be purchased.  Lots of research has gone into these devices with lots of good reviews before me."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "A well meaning (and, apparently, well off) friend bought this for my kids.\n\nThe UI is sluggish and the camera is pretty useless in even moderately dark environments e.g., Seattle around Christmas).\n\nBut, the real disappointment is with the \"apps\".  They advertise that it comes with 16 or 12 or whatever apps, but these are really cheap-o things, like a \"clock\" app and a \"calendar\" app.  These are more like accessories than learning tools.  So, I tried to check out the app store that they have.  Here, the sluggishness of the UI was almost intolerable.  But, I persisted....and, was shocked to see how expensive the additional learning apps are.  The ones I saw were $10 or $25.  Are you kidding?\n\nSince I registered, I've gotten various discounts emailed to me (30% off apps today!).  I really don't like that kind of marketing...30% off is a lot of money.  I'd be pretty annoyed if I bought a few of these apps on Christmas and then found out, later, that they run their store like a Turkish bazaar, where only a fool would pay fool price.\n\nThey have app \"bundles\" where you save a large percentage off list price, but these are insanely expensive.  $85 for the 2-3 year old bundle?  Wow...and, as far as I could tell, you can't try the apps before buying.  I assumed this was a razor blade economy thing, where they gave the device away for free, given how expensive the apps were...it seems absolutely insane to charge what they are charging for this device.\n\nWe bought a Kindle Fire for a plane ride last summer for the same as this thing costs, and signed my kids up for the \"FreeTime\" thing for a few bucks a month (pay as you go) where there are hundreds of apps you can use for free.  IMO, there is simply no comparison in quality or value between the quality of the devices and the content -- the Fire wins hands down.\n\nEDIT (1 Mo Later)\n\nSince our friend bought the device, I figured I'd give it a college try and buy some apps for my kids.  So, after getting one of the coupons that seem to arrive on a weekly basis, I did purchase a suite of apps and, I will enthusiastically admit, the apps have been great -- my kids love them and they are very high quality.  So, I've adjusted my review up to 3 stars.  That said, the device cost-of-ownership is very high and the device, itself, is maddeningly sluggish at time.  And, I really dislike the pricing model they have with the apps (you are a fool to buy unless they are on sale).  But, my 3 and 5 year old both love the handful of apps we bought and they are educational."}

That being said, his parents report that the set up was complicated and time consuming. They spent a good half hour setting it up so it was play ready Christmas morning. While the play screens for the child are easy to use and straight forward the parental areas are really frustrating to interact with.\nThis morning his mother attempted to purchase an app bundle and it took her 20 plus minutes to do so. Just to order an app from the app center. Getting to the app center was easy but once the app bundle was in the cart and she was ready for checkout the process became frustrating at best. Finally she was able to complete the purchase, but it left her very irritated. Apparently checking out requires password entry at numerous points, some of which are illogical. If no credit card info is saved and the child can't read, there is no way the child could purchase apps on their own. Especially since even getting to the app center requires entry of a pin code. Too much security, making a child easy toy difficult for the parent."}

The usability is excellent and he was quickly figuring out how to do nearly everything at 2 1/2.\n\nThe setup was a bit arduous, and clearly needs a strong wifi connection. Do not attempt to install this in the car or on the go without a pretty robust mobile hot spot. The LeapPad will react sluggishly and be frustratingly difficult to setup.\n\nOnce you've setup the LeapPad, it runs very smoothly and is easy to understand. The only downside is the much lauded inclusion of 11 apps! Apps such as a notepad or voice memo. They count a clock as an app. It doesn't take a genius to figure out they are pushing you towards buying more engaging apps, but at $25-$50 a pop, that gets pricey fast.\n\nThere are plenty of iPad and android apps that would be fantastic for their platform and provide a much cheaper option for content. With that said, the apps they provide are screened and safe. They are quite educational and clearly of high quality (for the most part).\n\nI would recommend this product hands down, just know that you're going to end up spending quite a bit more than just the price of the tablet."}

The Leappad is great for young kids that will only stick to leap pad apps and for parents that want to continue buying games and learning apps that cost anywhere from 5-45 dollars in most cases the best apps seem to be 25 dollars. You ncant even get into u-tube or put music on it that we have already downloaded from amazon (baby lullaby) The 5 dollar apps were very few and nothing interesting for my daughter.  I was also discourage because there where no baby sign language apps or zoo animal apps to download.  We returned it and will invest in a tablet for her that we can download videos from u-tube that are free.  On an occasion we will pay for an app but the most i would want to pay is 10 dollars but average no more then 5 dollars.

Furthermore, it doesn't come with instructions or a manual, although one is available on-line.  But finding info is difficult regardless (apps, cartridges, how to access the web...)  Had problems with username and password on day one--Xmas--and it took a while to find the proper way to access customer support.\n\nI expected more from a top kids educational company.\n\nUPDATE 3 WEEKS LATER:  I'm more convinced that this is one of the worst purchases I've made.  Wifi keeps on needing to be reset, settings are difficult to manage.  My 5 year old soe gets bored waiting for things to load, and the least expensive apps ($5) are basically videos or boring books that read themselves.  If you want anything with real learning content you'll have to pay  $20-$25 per app.  All this from a company that prides itself on being at the vanguard of children's education?

I should say we have owned SEVERAL, because they just continue to die, for no reason.  Some die within hours and some after a few weeks. Many folks on this site have done a great job of writing up all the issues their leap pad (s) ultra (s) have had, and our issues are mostly the same as theirs.  My daughter often asks me to please stopping messing with the leap pad and just play with her, because she says the leap pads never going to work.  She's right.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "I researched tablet options quite a bit and had high hopes for this device, but ultimately returned it.  I'd highly recommend considering a kindle fire (I have the 7\" HDX) instead.\n\nMy issues with the leappad ultra started immediately - the setup/parent information entry is poorly done.  Small gripe, I know, but I actually found myself struggling to enter my year of birth in a tiny dropdown that spanned 113+ years and kept scrolling to the top or the bottom as I tried to get to my birthday in the 1980s.  After every entry, here and in actual use, a little circle pops up on the screen that the device is thinking.  I understand this isn't a high end device, but I wasn't prepared to wait 2-3 seconds everywhere.  Even my son kept saying 'look a circle again' every time it came up.\n\nNext was the date and time.  It is supposed to set automatically and it probably works fine for the vast majority of people, but it didn't for me.  I was dumbfounded to find that I can't just correct it in a menu.  The leapfrog site describes some convoluted method of waiting for the date to be correct and then updating the time by an hour and then updating it again to the correct time.  Seriously?  It gave an alternative of connecting it to my computer which it said would sync the time once I downloaded some software, which sounded far better. Too bad it didn't work.  How can you not get the time/day right?  To add to the insult, two of the 11 included apps are a clock and a calendar.  So my son clicked on them, waited a few seconds for them to load, and then the leappad told him the incorrect date and time.\n\nSpeaking of apps, the included apps, a supposed $80 value, are a joke.  A clock.  Calendar.  Bookshelf (this appeared to be a folder for your ebooks).  A few things related to your custom pets.  To be fair, I did not explore all of them, but based on what I did open, I was not impressed.  This still left the kid-safe online content, which was one of the main reasons I went with the ultra over the regular leappad.  Disappointed again.  I didn't look around long, so maybe there was more.  But what I found were low quality videos which took up half the screen at best.  I almost forgot - one of the 11 apps is your choice!  Except your choice is limited to three apps, which appeared to be selected from the stuff they couldn't get anyone to pay money for. Each had a retail value of around $7.  I got an ebook which looked ok.\n\nI really tried to persevere.  The final straw was the games.  I ordered a few for my son.  They are not inexpensive - $7 to 25 each.  I tried leapschool first.  Granted, not one of the higher reviewed games they have, so maybe it was just a bad pick.  But from my perspective, it was utter garbage.  It did not appear to have significant educational value and the challenges were too hard for my son.  I thought they might become easier if my son struggled, but this did not appear to be the case in the few times we tried.\n\nSpeaking of games, I guess I've become accustomed to having enough information to make an informed purchasing decision.  This was not an easy task.  The best source I found was amazon reviews.  My wife contacted leapfrog and they were useless - didn't actually seem to be able to comprehend the questions we asked.  I hoped there would be an option for the downloadable content to try it and get a refund (if requested within a few hours) if not satisfied, but this did not appear to be the case.  I understand there are 'trailers' for some items on their site, but how about let me click through a small portion of the app?  If this is possible, the representative we spoke with sure didn't know about it.\n\nTo summarize, this device was a letdown across the board.  Maybe my expectations were set too high, but the best part of my experience was when I learned I could still return the item and get a refund.  I purchased a kindle fire HDX at the same time and have prime, so for $3 a month I have access to a huge library of content and can set it to only allow 'educational' content within the freetime app which restricts access to other parts of the device.  It isn't perfect - but I highly recommend you consider it instead of this device.\n\nOne star may be a bit harsh - I applaud leapfrog for what they are trying to do and still love the idea.  But I can't bring myself to give a second star when they couldn't even get the date and time right."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "I am greatly disappointed with the start up and the process of switching to the different applications. Little did I know when I got this for my granddaughter that one of the things she would most need to learn is \"Patience\".  For a product that is supposed to be designed for children, whose attention span is often suspect, this product can take up to two minutes on start up. Then once you've got it going and you want to switch to another app, be prepared to another long wait for the switch to happen. The processing speed is ridiculously slow when you want to change to another app. This Leap Frog Ultra is supposed to be the top of their line tablet for children and I can't believe it operates at such a slow speed. Very, very disappointed, as well as my granddaughter.\n\nSo, if you're looking for something that will test your child's patience, as well as yours when they try to get this thing up and running, this is what you need. I must say that once you're \"IN\", the programs operate fine and are very good for the children. Just don't understand how a Company that is making devices for small children can think that a child will remain interested in something that takes sooooo loooong to get started for them to play, especially in this day and age when everything else is so fast paced.\n\nVery, very disappointed!!

We have never even been able to get it to start up properly!  About 25 attempts later, six calls to customer service, five emails later, and about 10 attempts to \"tune up\" the software, it is STILL freezes during the set up phase.\n\nMy son received this gift from Santa Claus yesterday.  It was his one and only \"big gift.\"  He hasn't been able to use it at all.  I am totally disgusted with Leap Frog.  I mean, completely disgusted.  The tech support reps are almost impossible to understand because of the accents, the only advice they have is to \"push the right directional key and home key whole powering up the device.\"  This fix doesn't work.  It just sends me on a quest that takes about an hour of waiting for the system to update, then kicks me off at about 75% done with an error message that warns me not to unplug my device before ejecting it - except I NEVER UNPLUGGED IT!\n\nNow the stellar Leap Frog support team wants me to do a complicated \"Log File\" something or other which requires multiple steps.  The end result of this will be that they will then analyze this data and 48 hours later advise me on the next step.\n\nGuess what Leap Frog: the next step is I am DONE!  I am sending it back.  I sincerely hope you reimburse me for the $30 worth of apps we bought when we were in the initial set up phase and innocently assumed this expensive brick would WORK.\n\nI bought this tablet over a Kindle or Android tablet because I associated Leap Frog with quality.  I wanted quality educational only content for my child.  I'm so disappointed.  I will return it now in favor of an android tablet or a Nabi and curate my own educational content for it.  :(\n\nUpdate 12/28/2013: I contacted Leap Frog attempting to get a refund for the $30 worth of apps we purchased before we realized this thing was a useless piece of junk.  Spent an HOUR ON THE PHONE (57 minutes to be exact).  They are telling me they never refund app purchases.  I guess if you purchase apps even for a device that your child was never able to use because, you don't get your money back.  Be warned.  I will NEVER BUY LEAP FROG PRODUCTS AGAIN.  EVER.\n\nNote to Leap Frog if you read this review: Give my money back!  You are negligent in the design and advertising of this product.  I will pursue this issue until you refund my $30 and I will tell every single person I know who has little kids what a terrible experience this has been.  I will write about it, I will blog about it, I will keep calling your customer service line, I will write you about it.  Next I shall be posting a video review showing my four year old attempting the use the device and watching it freeze up so everyone can see how you made my child cry and ruined his Christmas.

The touch screen seemed to have issues as I had to press over and over again several times.  I went to the app store to buy more apps and found the prices to be $10-25.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "We have purchased various LeapFrog products since 2000 and again it has disappointed. We keep thinking this time they will get it right is and it is just too optimistic a view for this company. This operating system is slow and frustrating. It takes forever for it to respond - open or close an app. Typing in registration was frustrating for me as the drop down menus wouldn't respond predictably.  My 3 year old got tired of waiting for the apps to start and as soon as the screen filled with choices he would quickly push one and wait... and wait .....and wait and he opened a thrilling calculator app!  Woo-hoo!  I haven't purchased any apps as I am not sure I want to even keep this. Example of wait times: 105 seconds from touching power button until it was ready.  16 seconds from tapping account until screen appears.  11 seconds to launch the art app.  15 seconds to launch photo app. Another 105  seconds from when you push home button from within an app until the home screen appears again. Wait times do fluctuate I found, which makes it even more frustrating. These times were tested when the device was new and no extra apps were added. The apps included are:\n- clock (wow!) that is both analog and digital with audible declaration of the time. It includes a stop watch feature too for when your toddler wants to time you getting them a snack. This can only be viewed in vertical position.\n- calculator. Just the 4 basic operations. no memory so basically worse than the giveaway calculators. This can only be viewed in vertical position.\n- notepad. Uses qwerty popup keyboard. Useful as we know preschoolers like to keep notes on what they need to do today.\n- calendar. You can drag from a choice of 5 \"stickers\" on to the dates. You can also tap a date and write a note using qwerty keyboard that pops up. you won't be able to read the note on that date until you tap on the date again. Be sure you place your sticker first, because you can't put a sticker on that date if you already have a note there. Can only be viewed in horizontal position.\n-voice memo. You can record up to 16 different pieces of audio.  But only if what you are recording is really loud.  Can only be viewed in vertical position.\n- photo fun.  The pictures it took were very grainy on the screen and the reaction time was so slow.  It would click and you would think the picture was taken, but no.  So when the photo finally appeared, you realized it only got a blur of you or some portion of you. It has a lot of special affects you can do to your photo which could be fun if you can get a picture. Can only be viewed in horizontal position.\n- art studio. Lots of options for tools, but when you draw on the screen, it is so slow to show up you probably have forgotten what it was you started drawing.  Kind of like Crayola Color Wonder - slow reaction time. Can only be viewed in horizontal position.\n- bookshelf. You have to buy books for this. No freebies here.\n- music. comes with 10 songs.  Just music, no video.\n- pet. This has the most potential of any of the included apps.  If you want to wash your pet, play a learning game to start the machine, etc."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "My 5 year old received this for Christmas from his grandparents. In general I think it's a pretty good pad for younger kids.\n\nPros: very easy for my son to use, very easy for me and my husband to figure out, wifi works great, very easy for parents to purchase and install games, allows parents to use a password so child cannot buy games on their own, allows you to buy games online or in cartridges, apps are educational and make my son think a little bit, stylus is attached to the pad and tucks into the side so it can't be lost.\n\nCons: some apps are expensive ($25, typically these tend to be the name brand - Disney, Nickelodeon), camera is awful (son has no complaints, though), games/apps don't seem to download when another app is opened.\n\nAll in all I think it's a good product for younger kids. If my son was 8 or older I would probably have preferred an iPad. I also think this product will prove to be more durable than the iPad, which is great since kids tend to be destructive. I have had no issues with this product as of now and getting it up and running was very easy (aside from the in-laws' internet router kicking out all the time!). I recommend buying the hard case for it, which holds 6 cartridges and another stylus. It does come with a gel case, but I don't think I would want to travel anywhere without the hard case."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "Now I bought this for my three year old son with the hope that I would move him away from using my phone and focus on something that is educational.( Background note, my son has been using the computer since he was 1 1/2 years so he knows his way around technology.)\nUnboxing the device it does look nice . The design is intriguing, it feels good in your hands and does look sturdy. From my take that's all I like. I registered the device and started using it with my son. This is where the disappointment starts.\n-The resolution is poor. It takes very long to load ,so this irritates my son.\n-The camera is poor,in his words \"horrible.\"\n-The painting app that it comes pre-loaded with also has a delay so after you write or scribble about a second after you would see your design. I find this just unacceptable. For one thing when my son wrote, he kept on doing it over and over because he thought it wasn't working.\nHe really wants to like it but every time he starts using it, he gets frustrated.\n\nNext important point the applications are very expensive. You can pay as much as $20 for an app. Now some will say you cant put a price on a child's education but leapfrog you did. I spent $35 yesterday on 3 apps and those were just books.\nAlso, if you think the resolution is bad initially , It gets worse when you start reading the books.\nThe biggest thing is the price , you pay a hefty fee of about $150 for this thing , the same price you would pay for a 7\" Samsung tab 3 or kindle HDx and these pack features that are far advanced. The leapfrog comes no way close to any of these tablets for that ridiculous price and the sad part is that you easily can spend up to an additional $100 just to get the essential apps for you kids. The only thing that is going for this right now in my mind is the fact that kids love the idea that this belongs to them, was made for them.\nI might be the only one complaining now but remember this generation of kids knows about  8 megapixel cameras and blueray movies. So at some point they would get tired of this.\nI hope you take  some of my points into consideration because they are valid."}

An in law purchased this leappad for Christmas for him and I was skeptical from the get go but opened it up tonight ready to give it a shot.  Within 5 minutes of me opening it up all of my worst fears were confirmed.  This device is SOOOO SLOW.  We're talking a 3o second lag just going between apps or to close an app.  It froze on us while browsing the App Store- which took us over an hour to buy 3 apps because the device is so glitchy and slow.  It is extremely unresponsive.  In my household we have a Android Galaxy tab 2 and iPads and the leappad ultra is the equivalent to a really old slow PC.  Half the time there is a significant  delay from when I touch something and by having to press again multiple times it usually ends up freezing or going into another app once it catches up with itself.  It's extremely heavy and bulky.  The cost of the apps are OUTRAGEOUS.  I truly consider it a scam at this point when you consider the cost of the apps-  my mother in law purchased this because some salesperson at Toys R Us told her how durable it is and didn't tell her that she would be handing down a device to us that was too expensive to maintain.  The \"top pick games\" are $25 and books are $20.  I could buy an iPad and replace the screen twice for the same cost as this device and 10 books or top games.  Who is doing the math on this and still buying these?  And on the box it boasts that it comes with 11 free apps.  What kid in the world considers the calculator and stopwatch, notepad, App Store, a app of value?  What makes it worse is you can't even rearrange the apps so my child will perpetually have a first page full of useless apps he will never use.  This product is a HORRIBLE value and if I don't have the patience to sit and wait on a buggy glitchy program to open and close my toddler sure won't tolerate it.  There are tablets on the market easier to use than this with light years ahead in technology.  Get yourself a good case and call it a day.

There's no access to Netflix or even YouTube and their very limited selection of apps are $25/pop. Are you kidding me? This thing is $150 and comes with a few worthless apps built in, and I'd be looking at another couple hundred dollars just to give my son what he'd want to even compete with any other tablet or phone.

Tells you what kind of company you are dealing with.  Also, FYI, my son loves to draw, by they have virtually no art apps.  Like half a dozen, most of which involve tracing letters or shapes, and are totally redundant.  And they all cost like $20.  So whatever you think you save on the purchase of this cheap kids tablet, you will spend on apps since they start at $10 and go past $20.  You may as well spend $100-$200 more for an iPad or Android tablet where you can get literally dozens or hundreds of art apps, learning apps, ,etc, many for free, and others for a buck or two, and much higher quality,  This thing is both a time and money pit, and the company lacks decency or scruples and should be avoided like the plague."}

The idea is great and I have liked some of the older more basic LeapFrog products, but when it comes to tablets, they are out of their league.\n\nBiggest issue so far, is after having it for less than 30 days it just stopped and required connecting to the computer. There was no warning or way to bypass it. Suddenly there was just a screen showing the tablet and a laptop with an arrow pointing to a cord that made it obvious it wanted to be connected to a PC. This was in the middle of my son playing with it. Thankfully I was at home and able to do so, hoping to get it fixed up and back to him quickly. Instead I spent over an hour restoring the unit. First it started 'Tuning up' the tablet. Half an hour later it was done and restarted. At which point it greeted me with the initial setup screen. That's right, it had just done a factory reset and wiped out ALL of my son's data. All game progress, photos and art work. Everything he had done was gone! I proceeded to do the basic setup and reconnect so it could restore his free game. It then told me it now had to do an update. 10 minutes later the update is done and his game is installed and then I get to manually restore all of the music we had put on it for him. After emailing support I was pretty much told that this doesn't happen monthly, but it will randomly happen and there is no way to bypass it. Other comments I've seen have mentioned it happening monthly, but I've had it for less than a month and so cannot confirm and I don't plan to have it long enough to test.\n\nAfter the above alone I'd never want this thing, however, that was just the final straw. The tablet is not ready for public release. It is like am early beta product that was rushed out. The overall interface is slow and buggy. Many screens can't handle rotation and if you rotate while on them will put the button you need to press off screen so your only option is to use the home button and start over. Sometime you can't even do that and have to use the power button. Other apps don't like certain rotations at all and I've had to keep rotating the tablet until I could finally see the whole app so it could be used. Rotation is not the only thing to cause these issues. Doing things in a way the developers didn't plan for can often cause lock ups and leave you unable to proceed requiring you use one of the above tricks to get out and restart. While adults can often do things in unexpected ways, kids are pros at. My son is constantly pushing buttons and getting ahead of the instructions and the app just can't handle it. If you don't wait patiently to be told what to do and do it just right, it bombs. Not the way you design something for young children.\n\nThe hardware is also pretty bad. The camera is very blurry in all, but the best lighting. The memory is low.\n\nIt also cannot connect to hidden networks. You have to make your WiFi visible and leave it whenever you want the table to be able to connect.\n\nSupport are also unhelpful. It is your typical here is something from our FAQ that doesn't help and then 'we appreciate feed back and will think about it' type of response.\n\nAll in all, just avoid it and spend the money elsewhere. I can't recommend a specific unit right now, but I am going back to looking for a sub $100 android tablet and adding one of the children's lock down apps to it, along with a good hard case. My son already uses my Galaxy Note 10.1 quite well and just needs a tablet of his own so he can play while I'm working with mine. This was given to us as a gift, so I didn't see all of the reviews before hand. We will be returning it."}

We opened it to set it up for and what a piece of junk it is. It is very slow and choppy. The lag time alone will make any child become bored with it. It says you get one free download, but the option are very poor and you get to choose from 3 apps. Me and the wife spent 4 hours looking at the different apps in the leap frog App Store. The cheapest one we found was $5. More than 50% of the apps are $25. The apps are the same as the game cartridges you can buy at local store for about $15. You cannot turn off or block the App Store at all. For a 4 year old that was not a great idea. Anytime you transition from one app to another there is a 30 second delay for the thing to load. The graphics are very generic and the sound is horrible. We only had the item for 24 hours before we did return claim to amazon. Thank god amazon has great return policy. People please read the reviews before you buy and you will see they are all the same. I failed to do that and I payed the price.

My son already loves his leapster gs so I know he will love the bigger screen and dual camera the ultra has to offer. I'm giving this product 5 stars prior to my son even opening this present because mom had so much fun playing with it while setting it up. Set up is incredibly easy by the way. 5 stars! Edited review- I really love the product and so did my son. After 2 hours of very gentle play it quit working. The Leapfrog logo would come up but then it would go straight to a black screen. I'll have to say I'm very irritated, and wish I had read some of the negative reviews about defective leappads. I called Amazon and they tried to get me to go through leapfrog because it was out of stock on Amazon, but I've heard what a pain They can be. Three weeks later currently waiting on them to send me a new  Ultra which I asked. that its tested before it sent out. So hopefully that one works.

They assured me the error was with my virus protection software.  Again, the issue happened before I plugged the device into my computer so your guess is as good as mine as to how my computer's virus protection magically affected a device that had never been hooked up to it.\n\nI spoke with Leapfrog again today. Two different people kept asking me to send the log file again, as they claimed they never got the first one, so that they could figure out the specific issue. After telling them that it is not my job to figure out the error in their faulty device and getting very angry, I finally got to a third person who is sending me a pre-paid shipping label.\n\nSo now my son will be without the device even longer as I have to send it back to Leapfrog so they can repair or replace it and send it back to us.\n\nI am EXTREMELY disappointed with this purchase. This is an expensive product and to be yanked around like this by customer service makes me even more bitter. After one try to fix the product over the phone and internet, I should have been called back with a status and a plan to fix this.

After that, it took forever to do anything and I cannot imagine my lively 4 year old being interested in this thing for more than 2 minutes.  The apps are unbelievably expensive as well; up to $25 for a download?  Seriously?  The games are really low quality graphics as well.  Once I decided to return it, I also found that I can't delete her profile before sending it back.  The Leapfrog instructions say to go to the parental controls, choose \"edit profile\" and then drag the profile to the trash can to delete.  Sounds simple enough, except that there's no trash can anywhere and no controls to do anything other than change her grade level.  Really?  I will be speaking with Leapfrog on Monday (of course, they only have weekday hours for customer service) to see if I can get everything deleted before returning it to Amazon and buying her a Kindle, for about the same price.

It runs some old version of Android with some ancient hardware. It takes 10 minutes to boot up. When you hit the power button, does not go to sleep, instead it turns off then you kid has to wait 10min in order to use it??? Are you kidding me? It comes with just one useful app that my kid used it for 2 times and is down with it. Purchased few more apps and he hardly ever touched them. Oh and check out the camera, wow, I have not seen that kind of picture since 1999 from my flip phone. Try drawing, you can see 1+ second delay also the samples are far in between which means you can see half inch lines when you try to draw an circle so the circle looks like a pentagon instead of a circle.\n\nDon't waste your money.\n\nThis is the most terrible product I have every purchased and I wish I can return it back."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "We just got this and are going to return it. The main problems are that the thing is dog slow and the screen is of poor quality with lack of sensitivity and slow responsiveness. For example, it was difficult to draw a smooth circle with the drawing app because the screen was so slow and jerky in it's responsiveness.\n\nAlso, the apps are expensive mostly ranging from $7.50 to $25 so after spending $150 to buy the device, you can easily spend another $100 to $200 to get the apps for it. I think once a child tries an iPad or something similar and goes back to this, they'll be frustrated.\n\nThe positives are that it is sturdy and designed to protect children with appropriate content. But this can be a little bit of a negative too as you are limited to what they provide you and you can't even log into public wi-fi while travelling because you are not allowed to access the wi-fi log-in screens where you accept terms and conditions.\n\nWhat we are considering now are the low-end (or factory reconditioned) Kindle Fire or Google Nexus which can be obtained for a similar price but are way more powerful, speedy and responsive. Add a sturdy case and that physically protects them. I found apps designed to protect children that lock down the home screen to only apps you choose however that doesn't prevent you from using the device without limits to find the content that you want. Finally, there are many free apps or apps in the $2 to $5 range that are very good.\n\nIt's nice that the LeapPad protects children from inappropriate content however from my point of view as they get older they are going to access many devices that don't have that kind of protection and it ultimately it is up to me to figure out how to protect them on a variety of devices and situations that they will undoubtedly encounter."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "I bought my nephew the LPU for his 5th birthday. First off, he absolutely LOVES IT! He loves having the ability to capture his own family moments(pictures), he loves taking care of his pet dragon, and he loves all of the preloaded apps that came with this very durable kids tablet.\n\nMy cons, however, are you have to goto leap frogs website and download the connect program to be able to connect this device to your computer. Leap frog should really offer a enclosed CD of this software, to make it easier and less time consuming. The tablet stopped working on the second day of use. When you turned it on all it would do is goto the loading page with the circle when it first loads up. So, obviously, I had to go find the connect program and download it, after 20 minutes(using fastest internet connection offered in our area) it finally downloaded, and then took another 10 to install. So, were up to a 30 minute process here. Then, I was able to connect the LPU to the computer and it loaded directly to the connect program, taking about 2 minutes to connect. After connecting, the device must sync and download all content, and this took approximately 2 hours to do. So, were up to a 2 hour and 32 minute process now. After all content was downloaded, you then had to goto settings and either choose to repair or restore(these features will not work unless device is fully synced), so we chose repair. After 30 minutes of repair, the device was FINALLY fixed and ready for use. So this process took, an estimated 3 hours to fix. This is 100% unacceptable for a impatient 5 year old! So, for now, I'm giving this device 3 stars. Hoping that the next LPU2 includes the CD/Flash-drive with proper programs included.\n\nMy pros are my nephew loves the tablet. It has a lot of apps, compared to vetch. It had a lot more customer reviews, and a lot more positive ones than vetch. And it's a big tablet, great screen resolution, and it seems very durable.  I would be able to give a better review, but due to the complete meltdown of the device(mentioned above) we haven't had much playing time."}

My daughters leappad 2 was doused in water and stopped working. This was after a year of abuse from a 3 year old. I figured she is going to be 4 soon so I bought her the new model for her birthday. The first thing I noticed is it was really nice looking. The second thing I noticed is the latency. It takes longer to turn on and minimize windows. Games take longer to load as well. The leappad is constantly freezing which requires hard reboots. My daughter will also be playing games and the system will shut off on her and ask for her to update it. Instead of letting her play her games I have to go through the process of running updates which SOMETIMES work on the leappad itself. Most times it crashes and I have to manually plug it into my computer to do the updates. Also the videos on the wifi section do not load most of the time. My daughter will watch a cat video and then go to replay it for me and it crashes. This thing crashes A LOT.

The best update glitch I had was it decided to do a search for updates prior to leaving on a car trip. We are half an hour from home and my daughter decides she wants to play her leappad. She turns it on and it refuses to boot up until its updated. No way to do the update since not home so she is upset. I do not think I should have to turn on my daughters leap pad every single time I want to go someplace just to be sure it works when we leave.\n\nThe pros - Big beautiful screen\n\nThe cons- Slower then Leappad 2, even with a faster processor the leappad ultra just cannot keep up because of a larger screen. Crashes often, always needing updated. Wifi updating is hit or miss."}

I also love the durability of all LeapFrog products.  I can't tell you how many times ours has been dropped and it just keeps on ticking.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "I am not sure why this gets great reviews but I had to return it as it was just unusable.\n\nSo we spent $200 on this and 2 apps and returned it within 24 hours due to the following problems.\n\n1 .Powering on the pad takes way too long and the inactivity timeout is way too short.\n\n2. Setting up the wireless was easy yet frustrating as it wouldn't fully connect until i rebooted it and it gave no indication that anything was wrong except when I tried to setup the account.\n\n3. SLOW! getting to the profile screen is a long wait then once I selected a profile it took forever to come up. Selecting a different background even made it worse.\n\n4. Did I mention SLOW? Every time I tried to do anything on the pad it went to the loading circle and it just takes forever, or at least long enough for you to think it crashed.\n\n5. Crashes! The apps seem to hang and crash at start up even the built in apps do this. Also don't think about touching the screen wile an app is starting as this may also cause it to crash.\n\n6. The touch function of the pad is unresponsive. When I tried a few apps I had to touch the required objects several times before it would register and when using the paint app the line was always an inch or so away from my finger or stylus. the paint app also wouldn't register any fast swipes just little dots where I first touched it.\n\n7. One last thing, the internet on this thing is very, very , very limited with no way to allow any other content than what is served by LeapFrog.\n\nAfter all this I handed it to my daughter to try and within 2 minutes she didn't want anything to do with it and asked for her WiFi only iPhone back.\n\nSo I boxed the pad backup and returned it and for $50 more we picked her up an iPad Mini downloaded a few apps for $6 ported over her old iPhone apps and she is happy.\n\nIn short I like the LeapFrog DVDs and iPhone apps but their LeapPad Ultra is way to expensive for what you get. Now if they would just make more of their apps available on the iPad I would be happy to buy them."}

The bigger screen was a great and my sons loved the new camera so much so I have to buy another one so boys not fighting for it.  You can tell that LeapFrog really thought about the new design and tried to make the best in educational entertainment for your kids.

I purchased some Spanish learning software and I'm also looking for some books to put on the device. Both my children love to read. I also love that the games that come on the device are educational.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "This is the worst technological experience I've ever had. After receiving the LeapPad Ultra, I set it up for my son so that when he opened it up on his birthday, it was ready to go. I double-checked that the firmware on the LeapPad was the latest version, that his profile was created and that WiFi was set up. The following day, after he opened it and played with it for a while, it performed another firmware update. It then locked the LeapPad and told me I needed to connect it to a computer. After installing the LeapFrog Connect software on my Mac, I plugged in the LeapPad and.......nothing. I manually installed the driver per the instructions on LeapFrog's website, as well as tried the alternative offline installer. It still doesn't not recognize the LeapPad. This LeapPad is bricked because there is no way to get out of this terrible loop. It must be connected to a computer before you can use it and the software on the computer won't recognize the LeapPad. I tried another computer and experienced the same problem of the software not being able to detect the LeapPad.\n\nI contacted customer support. The person I spoke to had a heavy accent and, not only did I have a hard time understanding her, I had to repeat myself several times as well. After trying a couple of steps with no luck, she emailed me some instructions to try. Needless to say, these did not work at all. I'm so frustrated with this I'm about ready to get rid of this garbage and get something else.\n\nUpdate 12/10/13: I ended up calling tech support again after the instructions I mentioned above did not work. This person was much easier to understand and we had good communication. However, the conversation ended by him saying he was going to email me some instructions to gather the logs for the LeapPad so they can diagnose the problem. He stated they would get back to me within 24-48 hours. I followed the instructions and submitted the logs for their review. After not hearing anything for 6 days, I added a response to my ticket via email that requested an update. 4 days after that, I received a response which stated it was a driver issue and to follow the attached instructions. The instructions were the same exact ones posted on the website that I had already tried. Completely useless support!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "The LeapPad Ultra is a great product for the age group, especially for the price point.  My daughter uses and loves other LeapFrog products (like the LeapReader and the Tag pen) so she is familiar with LeapFrog, but we've never owned a LeapPad before.  We do have an iPad (mine) that has tons of kids' apps that both my 2.5 and 5 year olds use for about 30 minutes a day.  The main positive for us with the LeapPad Ultra over the iPad is that my children can play with this unsupervised.  With the iPad (or any other device that is for adults) there is always the danger that the kids can slip into something inappropriate in a flash.  I don't know how many times my daughter has exited her game or show and then been scrolling through YouTube.  With the LeapPad Ultra I know that they won't be accessing anything unsafe.\n\nAnother difference is that the tablet is actually designed for small children.  A previous reviewer mentioned the extra room around the sides for little hands to hold the LeapPad Ultra, so they aren't accidentally touching the screen and affecting game play.  I also don't have to fear that my expensive device is going to fall on the ground and crack, as the LeapPad Ultra is so durable.\n\nI think that it comes with a good amount of preloaded material (like the Art Studio & Photo Studio, plus the learning games), and I like that it has a utility suite so my daughter can access her own clock/stopwatch and when she's older, calculator, etc.  I do wish there was some way to download apps that I've already purchased on iTunes, but I know that is a bit of a stretch, compatibility wise ;)  Overall, I'm glad that my kids have their own device to use, one that is not only fun, but educational and safe.\n\n*I was provided a sample of the LeapFrog Ultra through a review program.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "We have been debating on getting something smaller than the family computer for our kiddos (ages 6 and 7) to use in the main part of the house or when we are out and about. We have a Kindle and a smart phone, but somehow they keep getting on the internet and onto an unfamiliar site or stuck on a pop up ad...not my favorite situation! Plus, I like my children to be playing games that are not only fun, but teaching them something at the same time. Earlier this year we got a LeapReader and our kiddos now \"play\" (read/explore/write/sing) for hours. Even when their friends come over, it is great entertainment. Knowing the LeapReader was a success and that we wanted some sort of handheld for our children, the LeapFrog LeapPad Ultra just seemed logical.\n\nImmediately out of the box, I like how it feels in my hands. It is not too light, but not heavy either. It has a thicker casing around the outside that makes me feel better about the kiddos handling it vs. my Kindle. I love that it has a stylus and it is attached because my fingers have a hard time selecting the write keyboard buttons (the kiddo's fingers are perfect for that without the stylus). Each child gets their own account/user and is able to keep track of their skill level as they improve. Like it says, it comes with 11 apps already and they will let you choose 1 from 3 other options when you log on. My daughter cannot get enough drawing in and loves to practice writing, which means we go through a ton of paper. Now, with their apps (drawing app included), she can color and practice all she wants. And thanks to the attached camera, there is no need for them to sneak my phone away from me to take pictures! And I do love the kid safe search, where they are allowed to access only pre-approved educational videos and resources. It is not like normal internet where they are allowed to type in whatever they want to search, but it is split up by topics with a screen shot and they can flip through them until they find something they are interested in. Phew! No going on youtube (thanks to cousins showing them where to go) to find \"What does the fox say\" type videos and then click on the next video to pop up, which happens to be completely inappropriate!\n\nGames/Books can be downloaded or inserted via a cartridge. I can see the value of purchasing the cartridge, because it could save you space later on the LeapPad, but with apps you do not have to worry about losing the cartridge. I feel this is where they get you on the lower price of the LeapPad itself vs. an iPad. Apps/cartridges range from $5 - $25 on a variety of topics. You may be able to purchase apps for your smart phone/iPad for cheap, but I feel like I can trust with LeapPad that they are going to be learning something educational. I have noticed that they do sales every so often, so I will have to stock up then. I also love that they have created games for EVERY subject/learning skill (i.e. math, science, reading, problem solving, patterns, etc.) and all the while it is basing it on each individual's skill level.\n\nI will keep you updated as the kiddos keep on using it, but so far so good! I get to bring along a little entertainment for them to appointments and/or long trips and they get to learn a little each time they \"play\".\n\n**I was provided a sample of the LeapPad Ultra through a review program.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "Got this for my 4yr old nephew. Wanted him to have something that was tough enough to stand up to him and was only his so he wouldn't have to give up the iPad anymore when someone needed to use it. I honestly haven't gotten a chance to even sit down and check out the apps on this thing because he has been playing with it that much. So he seems to love it. One caveat though. There is definitely extra costs to this thing. Since the Leapfrog app store is totally proprietary you are paying serious prices for those apps, when you first activate the device you get a one day only coupon for 30% off, bought a bundle of 10 apps for $50-ish dollars and so far that's keeping the nephew occupied, but I'm sure that at some point he will want more apps and apps cost between $7 and $25. So they are way more expensive than on the app store or Google play store. I suppose you could get the same effect on any tablet if you really configured the parental controls and carefully chose the apps, but you are paying a premium to be 100% assured that everything on here is kid friendly.\nSo TL;DR\n\nPros:\n1. Easy set up.\n2. Completely kid friendly with no additional precautions needed. Not even a chance of downloading anything bad as the web browser runs through a leapfrog branded portal that controls all websites.\n3. The tablet itself is actually pretty cheap for what you are getting. A rugged, decently powerful device that is completely navigable by a child. Super easy to learn if they haven't played with a smart phone before.\n4. Bought him headphones for it and now he finally has an activity that he loves to do that is actually quiet.\n\nCons:\n1. Not a lot included. There are maybe like 4 apps on it out of the box? One of which you have to download. So expect to drop some extra coin on other stuff.\n2. Literally everything except the tablet and a charger is an extra. There is a cartridge slot on the device. Seems like it wouldn't have broken the bank for them to provide at least a demo cart with some short games/stories.\n3. The apps are not cheap. Most are in the $15-$20 range.\n4. The cartridges are about the same price if not a bit more and from what I can tell, of similar length/complexity to the apps.\n5. Evil Space Devil packaging. I'm serious, I laughed when I read this in other reviews, but the box on this thing is ridiculous and operates counterintuitively to all previously known box logic. Their are like 23 pieces of tape on the thing that I cut and they had no effect on speeding the release of the contents of the box. The box is made by space devils."}

The LeapPad Ultra is a significant upgrade in every aspect, and if youve already got an assortment of LeapPad cartridges, it makes the debate of upgrading even easier. (BTW - my child is 5.)\n\nHeres whats new and improved.\n\n-The screen on the LeapPad Ultra is now 7 vs 5 with a higher resolution too ( 1024x600 vs 480x272). It is also brighter, has better color, and the touchscreen is more responsive too.\n\n-The processor has been upgraded to 800 MHz processor vs 500 MHz and you can definitely notice the difference, although the load time on startup and some apps still is longer than I would like.\n\n-The storage has been upgraded to 8 GB vs 4 GB, always a good thing.\n\n-The camera is now 2 megapixel vs 1.2 megapixel, but the quality is still just ok for a kids tablet.\n\n-The LeapPad Ultra has a built in rechargeable battery rated at 9 hours of use which is so much better than having to replace AA batteries.\n\n-The LeapPad Ultra also features a special kid-safe Wi-Fi which can be used to download new apps and games and also surf certain LeapPad-approved content. Definitely one of my favorite new features since I no longer have to plug the LeapPad into my computer to download content.\n\nOne thing that has stayed consistent is LeapFrogs build quality. Our LeapPad has taken a lot of tumbles and still works as good as it did when we got it. The LeapPad Ultra is definitely larger and heavier due to the larger screen and built-in battery, but still feels just as durable.\n\nIt would be great if LeapPad offered some free content to better compete with the Android and Apple app stores, as the prices of the LeapPad apps and games is a lot more than their competition.\n\nOverall the LeapPad Ultra is a great upgrade with the larger screen, rechargeable battery (LOVE THIS), and built-in Wi-Fi sure to make any kid happy.\n\n* I was provided a sample of the LeapPad Ultra through a review program.

There are tons of differences between the two models and LeapFrog really outdid itself this time. The two main things I love about the Ultra are the bigger screen and the Wifi capabilities. But there are lots of things that the Ultra has that the LeapPad and LP2 do not have it all!\n\nSome of those things are: Built in MP3 player, 800Mhtz faster processor, 8GB of on-board memory, 480p video recording, 11 apps included ($80 value), built in lithium ion battery, peer-to-peer play, wifi kid-safe web, and the 7 inch touch screen.\n\nLet's start with the Wifi with the Kid-safe web search capabilities. It's called LeapSearch and it's powered by Zui. If you aren't familiar with Zui, it's a website designed for children. A safe way to watch YouTube videos, game online video games. The internet is scary and not made for kids, so Zui makes it safe! Everything that shows up in the LeapSearch is reviewed by parents and teachers to make sure it's safe for the kids to view. I have a very curious kid so when she wants to know what a guinea pig is, she can search it and find pictures to help answer that question!\n\nI love all the apps and games available for the LeapPad systems because every one of them has an educational component to them. Plus, you can download or use the cartridges. We have the Tag and LeapReader also so reading is huge in our house. It's nice when she can do everything from reading, writing and playing right on the Ultra. Makes long road trips a breeze! Peer-to-peer playing makes it fun for siblings too. They can play games like Tic-Tac-Toe together on their own devices!\n\nI'm extremely happy about the lithium ion battery also. I went through batteries in our LeapPad like crazy. Now we can just recharge at night like we do our cell phones.\n\nWe normally play on an iPad but I worry about her playing on there and the parental locks are really terrible. I'm constantly looking over her shoulder to make sure she isn't surfing the internet. I'm much happier with her using the Ultra for playing. The parent controls give me peace of mind.\n\nSo my final thoughts...spring for the Ultra. The upgrades are totally worth it!\n\nHere are some free LeapFrog explorer codes for you:\nThe Book of Super Awesome Stuff (e-book): 5813 1140 1518 1413\nAlphabet Stew (game): 5813 0790 4610 4973"}

This is the first Leap Frog tablet we have ever owned so as a newbie the tablet was easy to set up. I got my kids profiles all set up and made and immediately blocked them from having the ability to purchase apps in the app store. This was a key feature for me and something I LOVE! No accidental purchases at our house! Speaking of the app store - the apps are crazy expensive, so that is a little bit of an issue. They will make good rewards or goals for my kids, we won't be just buying them freely since they cost so much. BUT I do love that the apps have age recommendations with them so I know which ones are appropriate for each of my kids. BONUS if you search on the internet you can find 2 free app codes, which is super nice!\n\nI love that there is a stylus attached to the LeapPad, although it was obviously built for a right handed person. My children are right handed so they don't find it awkward to use, but as a left handed person I find it a tad awkward to use the stylus because of tugging at the cord.\n\nI love the 7 inch screen. It is a nice size. The body of the tablet also seems nice and sturdy and while I won't go dropping it on purpose, it seems it would be able to stand up to the wear and tear the kids will put on it.\n\nI LOVE the front and rear cameras. Although the picture quality isn't anything fantastic, it is meant for children and good enough. My kids love the preloaded photo fun app to play with the pictures they take of each other.\n\nI love that although it is connected to my home WiFi it is kid safe.

First off, it was super easy to set up everything.  Once we connected to Wi-Fi, it only took about 5 minutes.  At 7 inches, the screen is a nice size and provides a clear picture. She loves using the camera and included apps, especially the Pet Pad Party.  She is even learning to tell time from the clock app. One of the best features is the attached stylus. What a brilliant idea, now the kids won't lose it anymore!\n\nAlso, love the web feature...she likes to watch kids shows and music on youtube but as you can imagine I am always concerned it could jump to other content.  The fact that she can browse the web herself and see videos and such on the LeapPad gives her a sense of independence, while I don't have to worry about her seeing any inapproprate content.\n\nAnother great feature is that you don't need batteries and can just use the included charger.  With other kids electronics, I felt I was always changing the batteries, so this is definitely a nice change! And when fully charged the battery lasts a long time!\n\nThe only downside is that the apps are expensive....they range from $5 to $25, so while my daughter used to ask to buy a few apps at a time on our ipad (usually free or $1.99) I had to explain to her she couldn't add apps as often to the LeapPad.\n\nOverall, its an awesome product for kids!!\n\nI was provided a sample of the LeapPad Ultra through a review program.

I was not let down when it came in.\n\nWhile I have not let my daughter play with it (it is a Christmas gift after all) I have spent many, many hours playing games and altering pictures once she was in bed.\n\nFor us to go from the original to the Ultra there are quite a few changes:\n\n-Front and back camera\n\n-Limited Internet access (LeapSearch is an awesome kid friendly search online! My kid is going to be sooo excited about this aspect I believe. I love that she will be able to watch videos and learn about things she is interested in without me being scared of what she may find if she types in something that would usually bring up questionable results. Besides, it is all pre-defined searches. You don't have to type anything! Just find the category you want to learn about and up pops a ton of possibilities!\n\n-Larger screen\n\n-New apps (Utility Suite is my favorite. This includes a calendar, calculator, notepad, clock, voice memo, and stopwatch.)\n\n-Touch Screen is more sensitive: you can even use your finger now! (this was always an issue with the original when my daughter tried to play it early on)\n\n-IT'S RECHARGABLE!! Oh my gosh guys I can't express how awesome of an improvement this is!\n\n-PetChat: For us this one is a little disappointing. We live in the \"boonies\" and don't have anyone else near by with a LeapPad Ultra. This means that she doesn't get to use this awesome feature. I love that it has options for them to choose to say to their friends and emoticons that they can send. They can't send pictures! I like that this is a safe way for kids to learn about the online chatting world. They are going to find it eventually so why not give them a safe way to join in. I do wish that there were a way for you to connect with friends that were a little bit further away. I wish that it had a parental option for you to choose the friends kids could \"chat\" with (such as family outside of the home with LeapPad Ultras), seeing as it does have internet access. Who knows maybe this will come later?\n\n-One cool new feature is that kids can browse the app store and look at games, books, videos, and songs that they like and add it to a wish list. You can enter your parental code and purchase it for them.\n\nOkay, so I have been rambling on and on...now you are wondering what is the OVERALL THOUGHT:\n\nGET IT!\n\nWorried about all of those downloads you got for your old LeapFrog products? No worries! You can download them on up to 3 products! Oh yeah, all the game cartridges still work as well!\n\nLeapFrog products are durable and never seem to disappoint! My four year old is far from \"gentle\" with her toys and yet they all seem to stand up and she learns a ton.\n\nI have read a lot of reviews saying that they recommend getting an Ipad or Nexus 7 or a \"real tablet\" for your kid instead...my thoughts on that are basically...are you CRAZY!? If you are buying this for a kid then you need to buy something that is durable, has parental restrictions you can trust, and is educational.\n\nIf you want one product that is perfect for kids then this is it!"}

The thing I did not like about them having access to those devices is the unseen content they had access to on the internet (purchasing apps, linked pages, etc).\n\nI was sent the LeapFrog LeapPad Ultra to review and the boys immediately loved it.  The leappad itself doesn't come with any extra apps, games or ebooks.  That will be purchased as an extra Christmas gift.\n\nHowever, for a SAFE LEARNING tablet for my two younger boys (ages 5&4) this is a great way to encourage them to LEARN while still PLAYING and having FUN!\n\nThe LeapFrog Ultra comes with 10 apps. When you register your device, you will be able to get an additional app for free (from a list of 3). I like that it allowed you to choose your last app based on your child's wants and needs.\n\nThe tablet is super easy to set up and create a unique profile (with photo) of each individual child.\n\nThe device comes with many things loaded straight from the box, so you may want to set it up before you purchase anything. Included was:\n10 songs (2 albums of 5)\nArt Studio\nVoice Memo\nPet Chat\nPet\nPhoto Fun\nClock (which also works as an alarm clock and to teach time)\nCalendar (learn about dates, days, etc) You can also add birthdays and other events.\nCalculator\nNotepad\n\nIt does NOT come with any books, so that may be something to load right away. It comes with games only if that is what you selected as your 11th app, so games may also be something you want to purchase. You save 30% for registering your device, plus LeapFrog has buy 3 get the 4th free often.\n\nThe device is sturdy and seems to so far stand up to falls well. My boys has been enjoying the \"green kindle\", and hopefully will not mind now that Jack (our elf) will be bringing them SCHOOL games/apps to load on to the LeapPad! :)\n\nI received the LeapFrog Ultra for review purposes from LeapFrog and MomSelect.

My son is 4 so I need it to be very user friendly and durable.  Having thrown my kindle and phone down and drowning several of our electronic devises I I definitely want the durability.  I like that the LeapFrog LeapPad Ultra is both of these.\n\nThe controls are very easy to navigate. The stylus is located at the bottom or you can just use your finger.  I like that the tablet connects to our WiFi.\n\nMy son likes the Pet Party game.  I appreciate that their are multiple levels he can work though and work on math skills and motor skills. Awesome Leap Frog!  I am really looking forward to the interactive story books. My son is wiggly he does not want to sit through a story most of the time. He wants to be doing something not listening.  I have found that these will capture his attention for a bit which is great another way for him to sit and learn.\n\n  The large high resolution 7 inch screen is amazing. Definitely a feature I as a mom and my son appreciate.  We love the art studio and camera.\n\nThe one down side I have found is the price of the apps and games. They are a bit pricey for my budget as I am sure they are others.  I do think the durability , and other features of this tablet make it well worth the money and it comes with several pre loaded apps which really helped.  Plus I know this will last my son for several years and grow with him.\n\nI was provided with a LeapPad Ultra compliments of Leap Pad for reviewing purposes. All opinions are 100% my own."}

My daughter, now age 2 is obsessed with the LeapReader. And now they both can't get enough of the LeapPad Ultra. I love that it's a little chunky, making it easy for them to hold (even if it's a bit heavy.) My iPod Touch has a couple of lovely cracks due to it being dropped multiple times by one of the kids. The LeapPad Ultra is super sturdy and durable. It comes preloaded with 11 apps which I think is quite generous. The 7\" screen is also great to have. My kids no longer have to steal my camera or my iPod to take pictures and make videos which is their favorite thing to do. The tablet comes with the ability to add neat effects with Photo Fun Ultra. There's more than enough apps on here already to keep them entertained, but I'm also really impressed with the apps that you can purchase. There are tons of educational books, games, and videos that I can['t wait to download. They are a bit on the pricey side, but I think the quality makes up for it. My son is learining Chinese at school, and he can't get enough of the Chinese language app. There are so many opportunities to be creative with this tablet - the possibilities are endless! It even comes with a \"safe\" internet, which I am grateful for since we've had some inappropriate experiences in the past.

When my five year old wanted to learn to read, but was getting frustrated with not being able to teach himself, we turned to LeapFrog.  When my three year old wants to read \"on her own\", she goes for LeapFrog.  Each of my children grab our LeapFrog stuff throughout the week, and sit down to play.  We have LeapFrog books, flash cards, and writing paper. My kids play with math, reading, social studies, music, art and more when they pick up anything LeapPad.\n\nThe LeapFrog LeapPad Ultra takes us to a whole new level!  Now, my kids can move between apps, subjects, and characters quickly and easily.  Wi-fi allows us to download new apps easily, and even play games with other friends who have the LeapPad Ultra!  My six year old's current fave is \"The Human Body\" and my 3 year old love's \"Ariel's Sing-a-long\".\n\nWe are big screen users in our house, so we have iPads, Tablets, gaming systems, and computers.  There are several things that I like about the LeapPad Ultra specifically:\n\nDurability:  This things is clearly designed for kids!  It is so rugged and I am never worried when my kids drop it.  The screen is large and visible, and clearly not in danger of shattering (we have shattered our fair share of tablet screens!).\n\nPeace of Mind:  This sounds so cliche, I know.  We let our kids explore more freely than most on the internet though, and this means lots of conversation and careful attention to what our kids are watching on the tablets.  When my kids grab the LeapPad Ultra though, I can totally relax knowing that everything they look at is appropriate and useful.\n\nMobility:  the rechargeable battery lasts for nine hours, and these devices are ideal for the car (or when out to eat at restaurants!).\n\nThe only thing we are not crazy about is load time between apps as it seems a little slow.  My kids seem fine with it though because they tend to spend a good deal of time within each app.  The coupons that the device comes with make adding new apps affordable (and it already comes with many anyway).\n\nWe really like out LeapPad Ultra, and I recommend it!\n\n**I was provided a sample of the LeapPad Ultra through a review program.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "My family has been a fan of LeapFrog for years! It all started when my sister bought Kira My Pal Violet. Kira was instantly in love with her talking puppy. Since then we have added a LeapPad, LeapReaders and Leapster Explorers to the household.\n\nLeapFrogs LeapPad Ultra is an amazing gift for any child ages 4-9 years old. It has been labeled the ultimate kids learning tablet and I have to agree. We bought Kira a LeapPad for Christmas last year and she has played, learned and has had fun with it almost every day. Now, we own the LeapPad Ultra and I am super impressed with its capabilities. As a teacher and mother, I am thrilled to teach my kids how to use the LeapPad Ultra.\n\nWhat initially impressed both mom and dad was the 7-inch hi-res screen!  Just look at the size difference. LeapFrog was smart to make this tablet larger. Its easier for kids to use and see if they are sharing the tablet (yes, my kids like to play togetherand if they screen is too small they have fitsIm sure you can relate).\n\nThe LeapPad Ultra is built kid-tough (durable and drop-tested) with a 7-Inch hi-res screen and Wi-Fi with kid-safe Web. Parents can set up the tablet and control exactly what the child can access. Just power up the LeapPad Ultra and set up the device by following the on-screen prompts to connect to Wi-Fi (please note that charging may take up to 7 hours). If you are not in a location with Wi-Fi, you can complete set-up (using the USB cable that is included in the package) through installing the LeapFrog Connect Application on your computer (if you already own a LeapFrog product, you probably already have this application downloaded onto your computer). Depending on your Wi-Fi connection, the set-up may take 20+ minutes.\n\nOh how technology has changed! Its amazing to have access to such great learning toolsin the hands of children, ready to learn! I love that the LeapPad Ultra has Wi-Fi capability. As a parent, I will have control of what my child is able to access. The parental portal needs a 4-digit security code to access. The LeapSearch was created in partnership with Zui, a leading childrens browser developer. With LeapSearch, kids can watch and explore 100% kid-appropriate web content that has been reviewed and approved by LeapFrogs Learning Team. The Wi-Fi access also allows parents to easily download/purchase apps for their child. Kids can even play peer-to-peer when two or more LeapPad Ultra tablets are connected (this I want to explorenow I just have to either buy a second tablet or find a friend who has onemore information to come on this feature).\n\nLeapPad Ultra works with LeapFrogs library of 800+ apps, games, eBooks, videos, music and more (which is greatwe can use the same games that we have for Kiras LeapPad with this LeapPad Ultra). LeapPad Ultra includes 11 apps (onboard and downloadable): Photo Fun Ultra, Art Studio Ultra, Pet Pad Party, Utility Suite, Pet Chat and more. (Thats over $80 worth of apps!!!)\n\nKey Features:\n\n  8 GB of on-board memory which holds up to 40,000 photos or 140 Game Apps\n  built-in rechargeable battery\n  front-and-back cameras\n\nThe reason why I gave it 4/5 stars is do to the wait time between apps. It seems to take a long time to load each app. I will update once my son gives the LeapPad Ultra a go!\nI was provided a sample of the LeapPad Ultra through a review program.

So no more of the fighting to make him practice at home , now he will be able to practice and be excited about it!

My daughter quickly got the hang of how to use it by swiping the screen and using her finger to access the apps.  The Pad comes with 10 apps and allows you to choose another one free of charge when you begin using it. There are some fun programs already loaded including a great art program which my daughter loved. It has a user friendly design and feels sturdy.\n\nThe cons we found with the tablets are as follows:\n1. The camera is placed in the corner making it difficult to hold the tablet straight and take a picture of yourself.\n2. When you're sitting off to the side of your child which we often are  to help our daughter, it is difficult to see the screen clearly when you're not looking at it straight on.\n3. The loading time of the apps seems long. When you close one app it takes a few seconds to close and then another few seconds to open another. This really isn't a problem except my daughter is used to the Ipad which is super fast and therefore she was getting frustrated when it took a while to load.\n\nOverall, this is a decent tablet for young kids. It certainly will keep them busy and offers the opportunity for learning via various apps which is fabulous.\n\n\"I was provided a sample of the leap pad ultra through a review program.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "I think what makes the LeapPad Ultra a great buy is that you can continue to build your game, video and eBook library with a simple download. With the Wi-Fi capability I can easily purchase and download new apps, games and video without having to connect the device to my computer. With the parental controls and that all content has to be approved by the LeapFrog Learning Team, I know exactly what my kids are able to access on the LeapPad Ultra.\n\nI also love that it's a durable product that can endure being handled by rough boys. My boys have run the LeapPad Ultra through the mill. It's been dropped countless times, sat upon, slobbered on and more... and it keeps working! Most of all, I love that it's a product from LeapFrog. LeapFrog is a brand that I trust to produce quality educational toys that entertain my kids and teach them valuable skills. We own numerous LeapFrog products and I have never been disappointed in any of their items. The LeapPad Ultra is on par with what I expect to see from LeapFrog.\n\nThe only drawbacks I've noticed is that some of the apps are a little price at $25 each (prices start at $5). I have a hard time spending money on apps for my phone/tablet so it's a little bit painful to pay that much for a kids game. However, LeapFrog does offer download cards which make for great stocking stuffers and I've noticed several sale offers for apps. Additionally, I've noticed that the load time can be a little slow, especially if your child is used to playing games on a faster electronic device like your grown-up tablet. Yet, my son doesn't seem to mind that it takes a few extra minutes for the tablet to switch tasks.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend the LeapPad Ultra to anyone who is interested in a kid-friendly tablet for their child. It may be a little bit more expensive than some of the other available tablets designed for kids but it is very great product and you pay for what you get.\n\n*I was provided a sample of the LeapPad Ultra though a review program.

With a 7 inch touch screen and vivid high resolution, it screams- \"Play with Me!!\".  This tablet is geared to children aged 4-9.  Originally, this tablet was going to be used by my 5 year old, and it is.  But, my 2.5 year old can't keep his hands off of it!  Luckily, it is very durable, because he already dropped it! No worries, it still works great! The LeapPad Ultra has two cameras: one on the back and one on the front, perfect for cute kid selfies :)  The cameras are not of the highest quality, but they are perfectly fine for young children.  The LeapPad Ultra has 11 apps included on it, and the opportunity to download (at cost) more through the LeapPad Store.  When you connect the device to wi-fi, you are able to download the games instantly, rather than having to go through a computer.  I love the quality of apps.  I trust that because they are from LeapFrog that they are going to be high quality and geared towards learning.  Plus, I don't have to worry about my child clicking on linked ads or trying to buy a paid version of an app, like I do with free internet apps.  LeapFrog also still carries the Explorer cartridges in stores that work in the device too.  I appreciate this, as the grandparents like to get them for Christmas.  The LeapPad Ultra also comes with an Mp3 player built in.  You can even upload your own music!\nCharging the Ultra is easy.  You can recharge by usb, but there is also a cord that will plug into an outlet to charge included also.  The one issue that we are having with the tablet is the time it takes to open apps.  It does take many seconds (10+) to get an app to open.  But, hey.. maybe it is helping teach my children and myself patience :)  My one big request for the LeapPad Ultra is partnering with Netflix to have available the Kid's section of movies.  The movie selections in the LeapFrog store are limited and a bit pricey.  If LeapFrog and Netflix were to partner this tablet would be *perfect*!!!\n*I was provided a sample of the LeapPadd Ultra through a review program.  The opinions expressed are my own."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "We've had the LeapPad Ultra for about 3 weeks. From the beginning it has exhibited glitchy behavior. For instance, sometimes the touchscreen does not work with some games and other times it is way too sensitive like when you are trying to type in words. We got the SugarBugs game and after a few levels the screen becomes unresponsive in the middle of the game. We got the Scrubbing Bubbles game and the first few times we click on it it acts like it is loading but then reverts to the main screen until it does decide to work. We have also found that the Artpad that came with the system is mostly unresponsive - it lets you change the marker or color when it wants, not when you touch the screen to change it. The thing that gets me the most about the touchscreen is that in several games that make use of a child tracing lines on the screen. Because the touchscreen is SO fickle, sometimes the tracing works and other times it won't even though my 4 year old is great at tracing on paper. Maybe older kids that press REALLY hard and super straight won't have this issue but even I have trouble getting it to register my lines without a few times of it telling me I'm not making a line right.\n\nThe time response for this model compared to the LeapPad 2 is unreal. With the Wifi, it takes a lot longer for anything to load. I start getting impatient after sitting there 30 seconds for it to do something simple so you can imagine that in this time a child will lose interest. My 4 year old daughter lost interest quickly. The browser is a joke. She tries to watch the princess movies on it but the layout is confusing for a small child and there are not a lot of sorting options as you cannot customize it much. It takes a mega long time to load anything. I was excited for her to use the browser on this so that she could stop coming to me and taking over my laptop but instead she just set the LeapPad on the floor and asked to watch YouTube on my computer. It really defeated the whole purpose. As I am typing this, my daughter is hovering over me asking to watch her shows. Depressing. I was hoping she would enjoy some of the games which are touted as being educational but I really don't find her learning anything substantial on them.\n\nWorst of all, we have had this for a short time. My daughter and I played a few of the games (liked those mentioned above) and pulled in a lot of badges. All of a sudden, the display showed a picture of the pad needing to be connected to the computer. So, I connected it and then it told me I had to have a user profile to connect to the computer. I knew what that meant... that it had deleted the profile off the system. There went all our progress and badges in the games along with all the pictures we had taken. I knew as soon as it had that message what had happened because I had previously read a review here on Amazon about another user having the exact same problem.... Because the \"browser\" is mostly useless, I wouldn't call this a tablet, but rather only a platform to purchase LeapPad brand games.\n\nIf it had been just one or two of these problems it would have been just a nuisance but usable. Combined with all the issues we have had, I cannot recommend this model to anyone. I do recommend the LeapPad 2 instead or try another company for a tablet. For this Black Friday, one retailer is selling an HP laptop computer for $180. I'll just end up getting my daughter that. I agree with other parents in saying that while the CONCEPT is wonderful and exciting, the EXECUTION is horrible and this model was not ready to be publicly released without some more debugging. Major Fail, LeapFrog! We probably will not buy from this company again."}

That would be like telling them, \"No more learning for you!\" LeapFrog products make learning fun, challenging your kids to learn new concepts. Plus the games in the LeapPad ultra automatically challenge your child as they master concepts.\n\nNow, the LeapPad Ultra is the newest system in the LeapFrog arsenal of educational tech. It features WiFi technology that makes it so much easier for parents to set-up, kids to play together and to continue keeping the LeapPad fresh with new apps.\n\nIn the box you have the tablet, a power cord and a USB cord. Eleven apps are included on the LeapPad. If you are still more comfortable with physical cartridges, or just happen to have a lot from previous LeapPads, then you'll be happy to know that it also take the newer, thinner cartridges.\n\nLeapPad Ultra Physical Features At-a-Glance:\n\n  Two cameras, front and back\n  Stylus\n  Headphone Jack\n  Mic\n  Volume Control\n  Touch Pad\n  Touch Scree\n  Home Button\n  Power Button\n  Black Padding around the Screen, seems to protect it from impacts.\n\nOnce the LeapPad Ultra is open, you'll have to \"set it up\". When it comes to grown-up tech, my husband does it. Kid Tech is all me. The steps are:\n\n  Choose your Country,\n  Connect to your wireless network,\n  Agree to the privacy policy,\n  Either log in with your current LeapFrog account or set up a new one,\n  Create a parent lock\n  Set up who will be playing with the device. You can add more than one child.\n  Choose your 11th app. It gave me a choice of Sugar Bugs, Scaredy Cat in the Spooky Woods, and Ozzie & Mack ebook. I love Sugar Bugs, so I chose that one. It downloaded wirelessly.\n  At this point you might have an option to get 30% off 2 or more apps.\n  And with that, set-up is complete ... without having to connect it to a computer or install a disk. I LOVE THAT!\n\nNow, remember that you had the opportunity to choose that 11th \"official\" app on the LeapPad Ultra. Once I finished set up I was surprised to see 18 apps/tools/games on ours. What happened? Well, I already have a LeapFrog account and have downloaded apps in the past, so they automatically downloaded into the Leappad Ultra. How cool is that. That said, the included apps are:\n\n  LeapSearch: This app is VERY cool. It took me a second to understand it. It is Kid-Safe Internet. kids can watch videos that are considered kid-safe. If you do come across a video that you don't approve of, there is an option to report it. You can also customize your child's online access in the Parent Settings. But kids can search for stories, how-tos, science, games, news, animals, sports and more, plus they can tag their favorites.\n\n  Pet: Create a pet, play games that teach pet responsibility, decorate your pets home, give your pet toys, and earn badges.\n\n  Pet Chat: If another friend or sibling has a LeapPad Ultra and is in the same room, they can chat together through their pets. they don't get to type, though, it's all preformulated pictures and icons. I wish they could really type, especially for the older kids.\n\n  Voice Memo: They can leave up to 16 voice memos for themselves. They can delete memos at will.\n\n  App Center: Kids can preview different apps. But they can't buy without your password. I tested it!\n\n  Art Studio: Load a picture to edit or draw a picture, save a picture. Use virtual coloring pencils and markers.\n\n  Photo Fun: The LeapPad Ultra has two camera, no flash. You need to be in a well lit room for the best photo. Once you take a photo you can edit it with magic tools, stickers and fun photo editing options.\n\n  Clock: Clock and Stop Watch options.\n\n  Bookshelf: Where the kids can see their ebooks at-a-glance.\n\n  Calculator\n\n  Calendar: Kids can see what day it is and type in special events or add stickers.\n\n  Notepad: Kids can add notes about things they would like to remember.\n\n  Music: An MP3 player with 10 Learning Songs already included.\n\nAdditional apps, in case you are interested, that we own are:\n\n  Brain Blocks: Sea Animals: Learn about sea animals and answer quizzes to collect badges.\n\n  Brain Blocks: Land Animals: Learn about land animals and answer quizzes to collect badges.\n\n  e-Book: Scooby-Doo! Shiny Spooky Knights: If your kids likes Scooby-Doo, then this is an e-book by Gail Harrison that follows a Knightly adventure of the Mystery Inc. gang. Jinkies!\n\n  e-Book: Go Diego Go: Underwater Mystery\n\n  e-Book: Nihao Kai-lan: Kai-lan's Super Sleepover\n\nThe screen is very sensitive - in a good way! I can use the stylus or my finger and easily navigate different screens. The kids can really customize the LeapPad Ultra to make it their own, changing the background and theme.\n\nAnd remember, you have a lot of control as a parent with this one. You can take off the BUY BUTTONS for content when entering the App Center. I made that change. I do let him maintain a wish list. And if you decide LeapSearch isn't for your child, you can remove it from the Home Screen. You can also eliminate Peer-to-Peer gaming from the Manage Profiles section under parental controls.\n\nMy favorite feature really is the WiFi. It's so nice not to have to plug it in to my computer and log in and wait. And how it just automatically downloaded other apps we own, that is AWESOME.\n\nOverall, I think the LeapPad Ultra is a fabulous learning tool. It is suggested for ages 4 - 9. I honestly would have given this to my sons when they were 2, that's what I did with the original Leapster. If you let your child play with any tablet or smartphone, you might find this more suitable. If gift giving, I'd probably go up to age 7. That is how old my oldest is."}

We have an iPad that he sometimes plays on, so the transition to the LeapPad Ultra was very easy.  He loves listening to music and stories, watching videos, playing games, and of course, using the camera to take pictures.  I love that the LeapPad combines everything into one safe, easy to use tablet for him.  It is recommended for kids 4-9, but even my 2 year old can use some of the apps and really has fun with it.\n\nI love that the LeapPad works on the level of my son.  I was concerned that since the recommended age is 4-9, that it might be too hard for him, but since it provides him with age appropriate things, he is challenged, but not overwhelmed.  LeapFrog products always impress me because of their educational value, all while being fun.  There really is no \"junk\" on the LeapPad and I know my boy is learning while having fun.  There is even an app to encourage healthy dental habits, which we need!\n\nThe size is perfect, too.  The screen is big, but the overall LeapPad is lightweight and easy to carry.  It's perfect for long car rides or doctor's offices.  It holds a charge for 9 hours and the WiFi function is AWESOME so I don't have to go searching for cords when it's time for an update or app purchase.  LOVE IT!\n\nI was provided a sample of the LeapPad Ultra through a review program. The opinions expressed are my own."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "We were given a sample of the LeapPad Ultra through a review program - I wasn't compensated in any other way & the following opinions are all my own. (And my children's!) My family has always loved Leapfrog's products (especially the TAG and LeapReader) and the LeapPad Ultra is no exception. I have a Kindle that I've let my children (ages 8 & 4) use some, but sparingly as I don't want it to be broken and/or dropped! When we got the opportunity to review the LeapPad, I knew it was something they would be interested in since they love my Kindle so much. It has been very durable so far. They generally only use it on carpeted surfaces (couch, floor on rug or blanket) but it's sustained a few bumps and falls, and is working just fine.\n\nThe LeapPad was very easy to set up. I found the keyboard letters to be a bit small but my kids had no complaints. They loved that it had a camera to take pictures, and that they were decent quality too. The kid-safe \"LeapSearch\" feature was a big hit - they could search for all sorts of videos & things, but safely without coming across anything bad. My son's favorite included game was the Art Studio Ultra and my daughter's favorite was Pet Pad Party. I love that they can both have their own profiles on there - so there's no arguments about the colors of the background or anything like that. Both kids have already added several games to their Christmas list that they're hoping to get to use with the LeapPad.\n\nI see the LeapPad being VERY useful for car rides, while waiting at the doctor, etc. The rechargeable battery ROCKS since some of our older devices always seemed to be needing new batteries when we went somewhere. It occasionally seems to have a wee bit of lag while loading an application or game but it's minimal. I love how LeapFrog blends fun and education - I can always count on them to provide quality products for my kids that will help them learn and have fun while doing it."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "We have used LeapFrog products for years, with four kids ages 15 to 3 years old, and another one the way we have used plenty of LeapFrog's products, from their LeapReader System to Scout and Violet.  Scout helped my 12 year old handicap son learn to spell his name!  We love LeapFrog's products, and was not disappointed with the LeapPad Ultra.\n\nOne thing I didn't like much about the earlier LeapPad's was connecting to the computer to download apps.  I really appreciate that LeapFrog took that into consideration - No More Connecting To The Computer!\n\nI also really appreciate the 9 hour rechargeable battery, because my son with cerebral palsy is wheelchair bound, and loves playing on the LeapPad. We recently learned about my son's love for technology, and LeapFrog products have helped him more than anything we have tried, or the teachers have done at school.  The LeapPad Ultra makes him want to try things that might be a little difficult.  Hes working on his fine motor skills, trying to do new things, and listening to everything that's said.  He doesn't focus on many things the way he has LeapFrog products, and he's amazed with the LeapPad Ultra!  He loves using the art studio app, listening to music, playing games, and just maneuvering around on the LeapPad Ultra. It's easy for him to hold, lightweight, and the touchscreen responds easily for him.\n\nMy 3 year old loves the LeapPad Ultra too! She enjoys the interactive storybooks, several of the creativity apps, reading and writing apps, racing games, and jamming out to the KIDZ BOP Christmas Party Hits music app.  Watching her use the LeapPad Ultra has been great.  She knows where everything is, and has no trouble getting where she needs to.  Thankfully, there is awesome parental controls.\n\nMy 7 year old also has really enjoyed the peer to peer games.  She can play with her cousin (or anyone else with a LeapPad Ultra) using LeapFrog virtual pets, and characters.  She uses the pre-loaded app, PetChat so she can text using the apps pre-selected phrases to her cousin.  They also play the Turbo Racing game against each other, since they are on the same network.  Thanks LeapFrog for the WiFi!\n\nThe LeapPad Ultra is lightweight, easy to hold, has a nice design, and has an awesome 7 hi-res screen.  I have found the LeapPad Ultra to be an awesome product, and plan on purchasing another one for my two girls to share.  My son needs his own, he doesnt want to share and since hes wheelchair bound I would rather him play with an educational device, and he's really working hard.  Thank you LeapFrog, I wish you could see how much your products have helped, and continue to help my son!!\n\nI know the LeapPad Ultra is for kids 4-9, but I really found it to be fun for the whole family.  I even catch my 15 year old playing around on it now and again, and her and my toddler will dance to the KIDZ BOP Christmas tunes we have on it.  I have played a few games, and my husband spends time helping my 3 year old play games all the time.\n\nThe LeapPad Ultra is a great device that provides kids with endless amounts of entrainment and education wrapped up in one.  LeapFrog send me a LeapPad Ultra for review, but all opinion are my own.  I really think the LeapPad Ultra is an awesome device, that offers kids endless amounts of entertainment, and its educational too So the kids are learning while doing something they enjoy.  The LeapPad Ultra is fun for the whole family, right out of the box!"}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "First LeapPad Ultra worked except for trying to use the camera, which always froze the device. The charger that came with the 1st unit was also broke, so we had to contact LeapFrog for a replacement charger (which they replaced with no issue). Ultimately sent the device back because it seemed like maybe it was a bad apple. On to our second LeapPad Ultra...less than a month of my daughter owning it and the device will not connect to the computer or read ANY of the 4 cartridges we bought for her. WASTE of $$$. This device is not worth all the time it takes to fix. Maybe 1 unit was a dub, but back to back lemons. I would not recommend this device...my daughter did like it when it was working, but that is a rarity with this product. Not sure I want to try setting up a 3rd one of these devices."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "My 6 year old has been begging for a tablet from Santa for Christmas this year. His 10 year old sister is receiving one, but I was reluctant to purchase one for him, as he is 6 and currently in a destructive state (not in a bad way, just in a normal 6 year old kind of way). His Nintendo DS lasted all of 3 months, while his Ipod Touch lasted 2 months. I was reluctant to buy a tablet at all. We love that LeapFrog has introduced a tablet for kids just his age.\nThe LeapFrog Ultra comes with 10 apps. When you register your device, you will be able to get an additional app for free (from a list of 3). I like that it allowed you to choose your last app based on your child's wants and needs.\nThe tablet was easy to set up, even for a child. My 6 year old instinctively knew what to do when it was turned on. Others comments on the load time, and it does take some time for the entire process to load, which was a little frustrating for my 6 year old. However, you will most likely skip this step entirely with your child. Just hand it to him or her once everything is loaded. This was ONLY noticed in the initial boot up (or when returning to home). To load the apps it loaded very quickly.\nThe device comes with many things loaded straight from the box, so you may want to set it up before you purchase anything. Included was:\n10 songs (2 albums of 5)\nArt Studio\nVoice Memo\nPet Chat\nPet\nPhoto Fun\nClock (which also works as an alarm clock and to teach time)\nCalendar (learn about dates, days, etc) You can also add birthdays and other events.\nCalculator\nNotepad\n\nIt does NOT come with any books, so that may be something to load right away. It comes with games only if that is what you selected as your 11th app, so games may also be something you want to purchase. You save 30% for registering your device, plus LeapFrog has buy 3 get the 4th free often.\n\nThe device is sturdy and seems to so far stand up to falls well. My son has been enjoying the pad, and hopefully will not mind now that Santa is bringing his sister a tablet.\n\nI received the LeapFrog Ultra for review purposes from LeapFrog and MomSelect. I was not compensated in any other way. My opinions and experiences are my own."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "First off, my son loves it because he can play Jake and the Neverland Pirates, but the only reason I got the Ultra was because of the convenience of WiFi capability. Well that feature does not work well at all. I will be on top the router and not be able to download apps or do anything online. Another thing is that it is real slow! And we've only had it a few days, I can no longer go to the parent settings! I am not satisfied. I bought this as an investment to grow with my son, but instead, I fear he will out grow it soon.\n\n***update 2-17-14***\nThe software updates has made the Ultra not quite as slow though I still do not feel as if the wifi works properly, but my child absolutely loves it. The variety of apps are great though they are pricey.  Anyway, my son loves it, so it's good enough for me."}

When our son turned it on tonight, it was asking to be hooked up to the computer.  So I did.  I thought maybe this was the long-awaited software update that would make it work better.  Alas, no.  With no prompting, or options to stop, it launched into a process to \"fine tune\" the LeapPad Ultra.  75 minutes later, no software update, and his profile is wiped out.  Every picture and video he took with it is gone.  Every drawing he made on it is gone.  All the music we loaded onto it, and the playlists he made - gone.  BTW, total pain in the butt to load music on this thing.  So everything he has done to personalize and make this tablet \"his\" has been wiped out.  Junk."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "I jumped at the chance to receive the LeapFrog LeapPad Ultra as part of a review team.  Previously, my 6, 8, and 9 year old children used my Kindle, playing their apps on Kindle Freetime.  This is much, much better for kids than the Kindle!  It seems exactly like an ipad, except that it's a children's version and costs you only about $140 as opposed to $400+.  When compared to the Kindle, the LPU is much more durable.  For example, I noticed my Kindle wasn't charging as well and that's because of the way my kiddos were inserting the USB.  This tablet is very durable and kid-friendly in every way you could imagine.  I also like that it came with numerous apps, and that we got to choose a free app.  My children have been wanting one of these for a few months--their best friend has the pink version and she has learned so much by using it!  Besides that, my children love anything to do with LeapFrog and they were very excited to have their own kid's version of an ipad.  They also really like the camera feature, and they like that it is tailored specifically to them.  I like that there is an option for parental controls, too.  I'm eager to watch as my children use it more and to see how they continue to do and learn with it, and I highly recommend it!  It's a pretty great deal, especially when you consider how much an actual ipad costs and that you get a $30 gift card with your purchase."}

After 2 months of owning it now every time we turn it on it requires a system update - and you cannot bypass it so the same system update is performed every single time requiring over 10 minutes!  Any problem-solving requires using their connect software via the computer.  But wouldn't you know the Leap connect software won't recognize it, while I have no problem connecting our older LeapPad or Violet dog.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "Bought this for two year old grand child, mainly for the drawing app it comes with so she won't bug me to play with my kindle fire. Several pros and cons. The cons are - no guidebook is provided. Booting up the pad takes a little too long. The pad comes preloaded with games one needs to figure out with little help. When the pad is held by a child, if her fingers are touching the screen area in the drawing app, the pad will not draw until she stops touching the screen with her other hand. This means she cannot hold the pad and draw at the same time. The screen gives delayed display of what the child is drawing - there is a lag until she can see what she is drawing. This occurs with the stylus or her fingers. The selection pad on the right is a scroll selection of drawing tools. I found the scrolling to be too fast, that part of the screen is too sensitive.  There is no clear button to clear a drawing. There are few apps available for purchase for the toddler age group.\n\nPros - the drawing tool has lots of nice selections - stickers, crayons, paint, pencils, etc. There is a pet app which she finds entertaining. The built in camera is nice for parents to play with and show photos to a young child.\n\nBottom line - for what this costs the drawing app and touch screen action could stand improvement. Child prefers the etch-a-sketch over the pad. I am sure the pad will improve, given time. It is early yet for this device."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "This is a great educational tablet. If you have two children and a tablet for each, the peer- to-peer play is the best feature. I can't say enough about how fun the Kart Racing game is, my five year old girl asks me to play this constantly with her. Of course this game teaches math also, which is the point: learning while having fun. One huge advantage LeapFrog apps have over anything else I've seen is the ability to vary the difficulty of questions based on the age and ability of the child. For example, while I play Kart Racing with my daughter, the game challenges me with multiplication questions while it starts my daughter with \"find the number\" questions that build up to simple addition and subtraction. The more questions she gets right, the more difficult the next questions become.\n\nTo address a few complaints I saw in other reviews, yes the apps are expensive compared with free or .99 cent apps on your iPad or Android tablet, but LeapFrog apps are not mindless entertainment.  Is it worth $10 to buy an app that helps your 5 year old learn to read or add and subtract? If you're looking for a tablet for use as a baby sitter, yes, there are better choices out there; for educational value, no.  As for speed, the responsiveness in changing screens is quite noticeable in the parent settings and during initial downloads, but I have never noticed any slowness in playing an app, which is what your child will be doing once you hand it over to them."}

We purchased the Ultra almost 60 days ago and it has been a NIGHTMARE!  Between the 200+ hours it has spent 'updating' and 'reloading the profile' (after it updates it wipes the machine clear so you have to go through the entire reload/create a profile.  We've done this now 8 times), 20+ emails to technical support, 5+ phone calls & countless tears to myself/husband it has wasted a better part of my life.  One thing to be aware of Leappad's customer support is only open 9am - 5pm M to F EST.  If you work then you are out of luck!  The online email response just sends you the 'cut and paste' fixes from the website.  I know I'm not a tech geek, but yes I did check online before calling/emailing.  The worst part was when the Leappad took over 8 hours to 'update' (wipe the computer clean) for the 5th time and then took 36 hours to update with all the purchased apps.  We've spent almost $1,000 on apps which makes my heart break.  If I knew how poorly the Ultra was made and that the tech support was so pathetic I would've stayed loyal with the Leappad 2.  On paper the Ultra sounds amazing (i.e., no batteries, bigger screen, Wifi, etc.) but when it doesn't work, takes countless hours to attempt to fix, etc. it isn't worth it.  My poor daughter is so confused why I can't just fix it.  Worst use of money on a toy yet.  Sorry Leappad, I really wanted to love you, but you made it impossible.  My suggestion...spend less money on marketing and more money on infrastructure (tech support, R&D)."}

We've used the Leapster, GS, Leappad and now Leappad Ultra.\n\nI like the Leappad Ultra build, it's sturdy and can withstand some child normal abuse during usage, better screen than the Leappad 2 and as usual, excellent apps library. That's the best asset in this environment if I can pick one. We've let our kids play with ipod touch as well but the educational curated apps in Leapfrog are much better in our opinion. However, they need to continue porting some older apps to the new Leappad screen properly, not just displaying it in the smaller resolution with additional on screen navigation button, it's confusing and not a good way of using space.\n\nWe recently bought Leappad Ultra, the immediate thing that we noticed was how slow it is to process anything. From the included apps like camera, photo, etc to downloaded apps, they're running much slower now. It takes good pause to go to home screen after you press home button, 15 seconds to launch camera app, 7 seconds pause between picture taking. So slow.\n\nWe even compared the Ultra side by side with the Leappad 2 and Leappad 2 is much faster. I don't really understand about this. Ultra has more memory and higher processor yet much slower. Perhaps, it's not optimized yet and they rushed it to production before optimizing the software.\n\nLeapfrog, please get your act together on this product. The hardware is very promising but you need to optimize it properly. I hope you can issue firmware update to fix this sluggishness very soon."}

This is one reason I bought the Ultra for my daughter but the only thing I really really dislike about this LeapPad Ultra is the wifi connectivity.\n\n1. You CANNOT manually enter the SSID anywhere on the sittings. Therefore, if you have your host network hidden for security measure you have no choice but to turn it visible to get the connection. This device is set to full wi-fi Auto detection.\n\n2. The NIC card on this is beyond lousy.

I have to repeat #2 above over and over again.\n\nI have the firmware 5.1.8.926 installed and called customer support about this problem but all they can do is follow their troubleshooting guideline. Either the NIC card or firmware causing the issues this is not worth my time when this problem continues.\n\nVideo and camera on this is not high resolution, unfortunately, I cannot rate the rest of the feature since I have owned this less than 48 hours. At this point I will be returning this back while I am still within the return policy. I am sorry this is a big disappointment to me."}

Big mistake...This product is simply not ready for prime time, even after the firmware update.  Here are some of the problems we had:\n\n1.  The product in general is slower than the leappad 2.  It boots slower.  Going from screen to screen is slower.  Opening apps is slower.\n2.  Apps crash regularly.  Several apps that worked perfectly with the leappad 2 crash with the Ultra.\n3.  The wifi is basically a joke.  I have a fast Asus router that I never have issues with.  I just decided to turn off the wifi.\n4.  The leappad connect software could not read our profile and is super slow in general.  We created a profile and then synced all the apps we had previously purchased.  Everything looked good.  We then bought 2 new apps and tried to sync it again.  It said that we needed to create a profile even though we had 1 already created.  I created another one and synced ALL the apps again.  Everything seemed ok, even thought the software never could see the first profile we created.\n5.  My daughter added a picture to one of the profiles and rebooted.  Guess what?  All the apps were gone!  After this I tried to use the leappad connect software and it was saying that the ultra was not connected even though it was.\n\nThe ultra is also noticeably heavier than the leappad 2.\n\nThe leappad 2 had NONE of these issues.  I really think the ultra needs a better processor than it currently has.  Maybe the next one will be better.  In the meantime, I highly recommend skipping the ultra and getting the leappad 2."}

After several communications with support over the fact that apps I had previously purchased could not be installed because they could only be installed on 3 devices, which honestly I don't get.  If I bought the cartridge from a retailer it wouldn't matter how many devices I used it on.  That aside my daughter was immediately disappointed by the speed of this unit, she asked several times why is it so slow.

I had a idea that it wouldn't be as tested as an Apple product but had no idea it would freeze/crash this often.\n\nI tried to stick with this for 2 months to give them time to fix things with their updates but though there have been two updates since it still has issues. Of course that means I missed the return window so all I can do now is try to file a claim with the company itself. I'm sure this will go well :(\n\nIn the end, don't get this because you want to take advantage of the wireless/movies feature because that option just isn't solid at all. At least the games (during game play) seem to work pretty well and not cause the device to freeze.

I looked up the pricing, reviews and cost of the apps and thought I didn't have one of these and I came out fine. Well the bell rang again on it for his 4th birthday and I saw the need for something that could be used as an educational game. All kids love tablets and I unlike others was not going to buy a 4 yr. old an adult tablet or any type of gaming system\n We have had this for a month and a half I bring it out in the boat with us, on road trips, and when I am doing work from my laptop at home he sits right there with me. . I was amazed at how quickly he adapted to the operation . The games are loaded with educational information, from math to reading and writing. He loves the games and has accelled in the math and writing letters. The leap pad taught him to write his name in a few short times using it. Yes the apps are a bit pricey but with a little research and reviews it was not too hard to buy the ones we can get the most out of. It does come with a good amount of preloaded apps as well. Overall, I am veryy happy with the purchase, the support is great, the website for downloading the apps is great and my 4 yr old LOVES it ! I just wanted to add, after reading some other reviews. The apps load in a timely manner,it's not an Ipad, but nothing that is unacceptable and the interface for downloading the apps is very good. The wi-fi works great too !"}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "I bought the Leappad ultra for my 4-yr-old son and was very disappointed with the product. I agree with the users who have indicated that the product's advertisement heralding \"wi-fi\" is very, very misleading.  The advertisements and the box claim that the product comes with \"kid-friendly\" wi-fi and that the kid can access kid-friendly websites like \"pbskids.org.\"  This was actually the main reason I bought this device. First, there is no actual web browser on the device.  What is meant by \"kid-friendly wi-fi,\" is that there is a catalog of videos already stored on the device and these are the videos that the children can watch. The children choose from the already-selected and already-stored videos that happen to come from websites like youtube and pbskids.org (although I don't recall finding any from pbskids.org).  The children, however, don't actually get to go on the internet to the kid-friendly sites.  Second, while the device has a 7-inch screen, many of these videos pop up in boxes that are quite literally 2inches X 2 inches within the 7-inch screen.  This was very frustrating. If the device is going to have a 7-inch screen, then the videos should show up on the entire screen.\n\nI also agree with the many other reviewers who explained that the device was very, very slow.  The registration/update part of the process went rather smoothly for us, but going from one app to the other took a very long time-roughly between 30-45 seconds.\n\nI was also not at all impressed with the prices for most of the apps on the leapfrog app store.  Most of the substantive learning apps cost $25!!  There are other apps available for $5 (this being the LEAST expensive) and $7.50 but many of these were for 30 minute videos that my son can already watch on Netflix on my Ipad.  I paid, after taxes, $160 for this device.  If I purchase just 4 apps at $25 each, Im already looking at $260 for the device. And that's having purchased just 4 apps!!!  I can pay a little more than that for an Ipad mini with a case and search the Apple store for apps that are much reasonably priced.  I don't bat an eye having to pay .99 cents or 2.99 for an app. But $25?  That's insane!  Practically, I think it makes much more sense just purchasing an Ipad mini.  The leappad ultra would probably end up being more expensive by the time I pay for all of the apps I would want for my son.  And at least I know that my son can also stream netflix on the Ipad, take pictures as well, video record, and actually visit kid-friendly apps.\n\nI thankfully was able to return my device and get a full refund."}

Mostly because of this, the original LeapPad that we have was used for 15 hours in its entire life while this one was used for probably 10.\n\nWith an iPad mini that has 2 times more memory and costs twice I wonder who would buy the LeapPad. It has absolutely no value for. If they would offer it for free (to make money on apps alone) it would not be worth it for me.\n\nAny of the tablets + a tough case would be more useful than this and it would also offer a lot more in terms of available applications and other content (videos, books, etc)."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "My 5-year old daughter absolutely loves her LeapPad and she was thrilled to get a brand new LeapPad Ultra. I think if you're looking at both and trying to decide, the Ultra is the way to go if it's within your budget. Yes, it's a lot more expensive, but I think overall it's a better product with better longevity. My quibbles with it are very minor, but I'll list the things I like and things I don't like quite as much about the product when comparing to the LeapPad/LeapPad 2.\n\nPros:\nBuilt in battery - The old LeapPad ate through batteries so it's nice to be able to plug it in.\n\nLarger screen - My daughter really likes the bigger screen on the new Ultra. It definitely allows for better visuals when playing a game and it's also nicer to have a larger screen when watching videos.\n\nBuilt-in mp3 player - This wasn't even an option on the original LeapPad. On the LeapPad 2 it's an app you have to purchase. It's nice to be able to load up all my daughter's music for her.\n\nFront AND back camera - The original LeapPad only had a camera on the back and there are sometimes when your child might want to take a selfie.\n\nEasy setup to start playing quickly - The setup process is quick and easy and your child can be off and running right away.\n\nBuilt-in wi-fi with kid-safe browser - The previous LeapPads don't have wi-fi which is very nice. It's cool to shop the app store directly from the device, too.\n\nVoice memos - This may seem silly, but my daughter LOVES to record herself in the voice memos app that is built-in. She records all kinds of songs and things and then plays them back later. This has got to be one of her favorite features. What kid doesn't love recording themselves?\n\nBackwards compatibility - Works with all the same games as the previous LeapPad. If you already own games from the previous system, you can use them with this.\n\nCons:\nBuilt in battery - I know this was on the \"Pros\" list and I think it is, but some might not. Just make sure that sucker is charged before you set off on your adventure.\n\nBigger size - This one is definitely bigger than the LeapPad/LeapPad 2 and it's heavier. This might be an issue for smaller kids (or moms with smaller purses).\n\nUntinuitive to get games onto system during setup - I don't understand why my previous purchases couldn't be downloaded all at once via wi-fi during setup. I had to plug it in to the computer to do it. There seemed to be a way, but it was an app at a time and it wasn't intuitive.\n\nSystem load sometimes freezes/takes awhile - We've experienced some freezing on power up. Shutting down and turning it on again seems to correct the issue. Hopefully this will be addressed in a future update.\n\nOverall, as you can see, the \"cons\" are really just some small annoyances. Overall, this is a solid product and we're really happy with it."}

This is not a more budget conscious kid friendly version of an android or even an Apple iPad tablet.  To me this feels like one of those learning laptops with the little black-and-white LCD screens that were made by VTECH, only with a tablet look that makes kids feel like they have grown-up technology, when, in reality, they are using a child's toy with a mildly techy facade.  And our home the leap pad ultra was used with a fair amount of excitement for an hour or so and then it was just left in the toybox because we can't afford a $7.99 or $30 app and the Wi-Fi was spotty at best (our home Wi-Fi is fairly predictable and doesn't cut out often but the leapfrog just wouldn't communicate nicely after that first hour or so, even though our other wifi devices were chatting away, at their usual speed).\n\nMy advice is to look at other tablets AND the more rugged cases available for the tablet you choose. The value of the leap pad ultra is minimal the price you will pay for apps and the inability to scale it up as your child grows, without breaking the bank.  What I like so much about it tablets we regularly use at home, is that I can customize them for my son; I can add apps that are appropriate for him & I can set parental restrictions.  The value, the monetary cost, when considering hardware & software purchases lead me to believe that LeapPad Ultra is not a good value, or a bargain, when compared to more expensive hardware because in comparing, side by side, they are probably around equal cost, but LeapPad Ultra has a sort of planned obsolescence built in, in regards to growth and functionality as a child grows and developes, The operation of non-LeapFrog tablets is also more educational because kids are learning how to use a tool/tools that they will likely be using for the rest of their lives,  in some capacity.\n\nI realize how LeapFrog makes money with products such as this. Obviously, it's the consumables, and not the initial purchase of the device, that are there bread-and-butter.  I do wish they would've considered the technological savvy and the technology education needed by kids today, in designing their business model for the leap pad ultra as well as the operating system.  Perhaps someday there will be a firmware update that makes this product inherently more usable and scalable for kids of all ages while remaining appropriate and protected.  OL PC did it with their XO laptop and now I believe they're going to do it with their tablet.  I'm just surprised that it seems that leapfrog hasn't looked at other available technologies and similar products to try to figure out how to blow them out of the water. Instead They have pretty much stuck to the same principles of their other products have which are fine (don't get me wrong we have a few LeapFrog products that My son & I adore) but that also doesn't make this a modern tablet and I think many kids especially ones over the age of five will see that this is a toy and it's not really a tablet and the functionality is limited."}

In the world where Apple seems to dominate personal electronics, I was curious if the LeapPad Ultra Learning Tablet filled a niche that was not currently covered by an Apple iSomething or other.\n\nBeing nearly 40 years old, I am well outside the manufactures suggested age range of 4 to 9 years old, so my test subjects were my three children, aged 10, 7, and 6.  All three children currently utilize iPod touches and an iPad.  The oldest also has a Kindle.\n\nPrior to giving the LeapPad Ultra to the children, I decided I better check it out first.  Initial configuration for Wi-Fi and setting up the kids profiles were quite easy for my wife and I.  We did not have much difficulty in figuring out any aspect of the setup of the device or an individual profile\n\nWe handed it over to the children and let them play with it for a month.  Despite my children having access to more expensive electronics, the LeapPad Ultra Learning Tablet was still a hit.  The biggest hit was the game \"Pet\" that came with the tablet.  Evidently, the app is a game where you can build a home for your pet.  I admit I have not actively played with this app, but to me it looked like a simplistic version of the WebKinz website.  As I said, I have not played with the app that much, so I could be way off.  The kids liked it though.\n\nI spent some time with the LeapPad Ultra Tablet to ensure I had some feel for the device.  One of the things I noticed right away is that compared to other personal electronics, whatever this device does, it does it slow.  It is slow to load, slow to launch an app, and slow to turn off.  I examined the LeapSearch internet area.  I was a bit disappointed that there was not some sort of web browsing capabilities on the tablet.  The web area currently consists of preselected/prescreened YouTube videos and various pictures.  A check of the App Center showed me that most apps seemed to cost $7.50.\n\nI asked each of my children what they thought about the LeapPad Ultra Tablet.  While this seemed to be a popular device amongst them, they had surprisingly little to say:\n\n7 Year Old:  Liked the game called Pet.  Ranked the device 4.5 stars out of 5.\n\n10 Year Old:  They liked how you can have your own profile and customize it.  They did not like how it loads super slow.  They did like the LeapSearch function and showed me a few videos.  They also gave a thumbs up to the Art Studio app.  They gave the device 3.5 stars out of 5.\n\n6 Year Old:  The comments of my 6 year old virtually mimicked my 7 year old.  They specifically mentioned they liked the included Pet App.  They rated the device 4 stars out of 5.\n\nAs I mentioned, I was curious of the LeapPad Ultra Tablet filled a niche not currently covered by some other device.  After using the device for about a month, I honestly believe it does.  If I had a younger child that was at the stage where they wanted to have a device like mom, dad, or a sibling, but you did not want to spring for an Apple product, then this might be a good alternative.  I think it would be an excellent choice for a child who has not yet developed the fine motor skills to manipulate an iPad Touch.\n\nWhile I would not hesitate recommending this product for younger children, I would also recommend possibly considering other options.  A base iPod Touch with a 3 year Accident Protection warranty from SquareTrade(vital for delicate electronics used by children in my opinion) would run about twice the current price of the LeapPad Ultra Tablet.  The iPod Touch would offer you much greater versatility than the LeapPad and most any app a child would use is free or has a minimal cost.  Purchase a dozen apps from LeapPad and you have almost made up the difference already.  The iPod Touch or similar device might not be a feasible solution for everyone for various reasons, but it is something worth considering."}

Granted she is under the suggested age range, I found plenty to keep her amused and found it was some great educational together time.\n\nShe loved the music, ebook, and camera features the most.  With assistance, she had fun taking photos and editing them.  Plus the movie feature really held her interest in being able to record a movie of herself or something else like a tv show. The ebook was something she could hold and enjoy it being read to her.\n\nI like the option that it can work plugged in while charging so you have that flexibility.  The wifi feature set up nicely but I did find the screen was a little sensitive in that I had some typos of duplicate letters even using the stylus.\n\nWhen not in use the device turned itself off after around 4 minutes.\n\nI'd recommend this for any child that likes a tablet and those parents that want some educational applications."}

She uses the camcorder, the camera, and the calculator in chief, and then uses the Kindle and computer for everything else such as movies (Netflix and others), educational computer programs such as Starfall (free) and ABC Mouse, books, and other apps and games that we can access for her for 99 cents or for free.  Problem is that all the available programs and downloads for the Leap Pad start at $10 and go up from there, which makes other devices preferable.  (One free game is included on purchase.)\n\nQuality-wise it seems well-built and we like the exterior \"padding\" to protect from drops and bumps.  One fuctional problem noted is that the orientation is slow to change when turned, especially in comparison to other devices with this same feature.\n\nAll-in-all this is a nice educational tool for a young child, but having expensive apps is a big drawback."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "I have a 4 and 8 year old. We have the monsters leappad2 as well as the ultra. Not surprisingly, they both prefer the bigger screen and creative features. The applications compared to the smaller versions are almost three times the size. This allows my 4 year old to see the pictures clearer, but it also makes dragging a little more difficult since he has to hold down the bigger piece longer and move his arm more. I'm not negative over this since it give him the exercises he needs to build strength. (He is a true ambidextrous and without a favored hand, both are not as strong as if he chose one over the other)\n\nMy eight year old loves the record-able mic and creative art sections. He also uses the notepad, which is like a Microsoft Word sheet, which you have the option to save. I usually have him practice his spelling words on that without protest. No need to buy rechargeable batteries or a recharger pack, it comes with a charger that can also stay plugged into the wall as well as a usb plug to sinc with a computer or use with a car adapter (sold separately) for car rides.\n\nSince both my boys are still very young, I have not taken advantage of the wifi feature, for safety reasons. The boys do not know any differently and there is no difference of the games on either of the leappads.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "I'm 49 and I have my own \"adult\" tablets...so naturally this Leapfrog tablet was not intended for use by me.  I had a 7 year old boy in mind as the recipient / test-driver.\n\nBut before he took control, this 49-year-old still had some work to do.  I had to get it set up and connected and ready to go.  And that process was very easy.  Right out of the box, the Leapfrog had enough of a charge so that I could get started immediately.  And when you first turn it on, it immediately guides you step-by-step throught the setup process.  The setup is simple (perhaps even SIMPLISTIC) and really geared towards someone who has never used a tablet before.  It's nearly idiot-proof, which is good.  Yes, it's a bit frustrating for someone with a bit more experience...but the last thing you'd want is to buy this and then NOT be able to connect to wi-fi, for example, because set-up was too complicated.\n\nAfter the brief setup, I handed it over to the 7 year old.  Let's just say he took to it very well.  This is a kid who has regular access to an ipad...so I was worried he'd get no use out of the Leapfrog.  I needn't have worried.  He has spent hours and hours with it.  Often playing the same games over and over.  As an adult, I'd be driven crazy...but we all know kids thrive on repetition.  The Leapfrog was VERY popular indeed.  And I should note that as of this writing, no additional games have been purchased beyond what comes with the device...and he's still having fun.\n\nIt appears to be durable as well.  Although he's not particularly careless with it, I wouldn't say it gets TLC either.  But it keeps going and going.  It also connects to the \"internet\" but actually only to carefully selected kid-friendly stuff.  For example, there's a youtube kinda place that mostly contains silly videos of cats jumping on things or kids saying whacky things.  Very \"American's Funniest Home Videos\" type of stuff.  He loves it.\n\nThe screen is not hi-def or anything.  This is NOT an ipad...it operates a lot like one, but it isn't some limitless capacity/capability type of device.  It's a learning and entertainment device...with the emphasis on entertainment, in my opinion.\n\nOne area of difficulty we ran into.  There was a free game (don't remember title) that we tried to download and it just never worked.  Because we weren't trying to buy additional games, I don't know if this was just a peculiarity with this one free game, or if there are consistent problems downloading outside content.  So take this criticism for what it's worth.\n\nOverall this is a fine product for young kids.  Once a child reaches, I would guess, age 9...this device will NOT be very exciting.  I think 5-8 years is probably the sweet spot."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "If you have kids who have been using Leapfrog's various game platforms, especially the LeapPad, the Ultra extends the usable life of the platform for your child a bit longer by making it more tablet like. A larger screen with higher resolution and wifi to connect to the internet (what appears to be a very limited browser was still in development when I last checked) give older kids more to play with.\n\nA notable difference between the Ultra and regular LeapPads is that the Ultra has a built-in, non-changeable rechargable battery. It generally lasts a long time and charges relatively quickly (several hours) but could present a problem for long trips.\n\nAs a parent, when setting up the Ultra you are prompted to log in with a PIN so be sure to write this down or use something memorable. This allows the parents access to the store but keeps kids from making unapproved purchases and changes to the account. In essence, this step takes the place of downloading and installing LeapFrog Connect. Once connected, you have access to apps for the Ultra as well as any other applicable apps that may have worked on the smaller LeapPads. This is a nice touch - some companies might not allow something as simple as sharing apps like this. What bugged me was that there is no way to tell what has been already downloaded or is downloading. All apps available in your account are simply marked \"Download\" and don't change once chosen.\n\nAs an adult, I find I'm annoyed by some things kids don't seem to care about - so take these from that angle. The on-screen keyboard is *very* sensitive and lead to many mistypes, which was especially frustrating while setting up our wifi password. Swiping between screens is a hit and miss affair. Sometimes you get it to swipe, sometimes not and you wind up opening an app.\n\nThese issues are minor. As an adult you expect more - you would rip Apple to shreds for behavior like this on an iPad. Your kids will love it, however, just like mine do - they don't notice these minor problems. It's bigger, brighter, bolder, better in almost every way. It needs a firmware update to smooth out some rough edges, and I'm betting that will come some time soon to help spur good reviews in time for the holidays."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "The Leap Pad Ultra is clearly meant to be a product designed to carve out a niche in the tablet market. While many of us have seen the spoiled youngsters in the supermarket or at the restaurant tapping away on their own iPad, it's unrealistic to think that every kid should own one or that parents need to buy them for their kids. Personally, I think it's ridiculous to stick a $500, high-tech computer into the dirty, careless and irresponsible hands of a toddler. But, that's a whole other topic...\n\nThe Leap Pad is made to look like a tablet computer for kids, and that's just what it is. It has a very large touch screen, wi-fi connectivity, downloadable apps, a video recorder/camera, a calculator, and music player. Like previous \"Leap\" products, this product is designed to be durable in the hands of children. It has a solid feel in your hands and boasts the familiar green-and-white coloration of most of its predecessors. My family has owned three other Leap Frog products, and we have always been happy with them. Like all of the others, this one can work through a battery pretty quickly. (The packaging says it has a 9-hour life, but I would say that 8 is more realistic!) At least this product has its own rechargeable battery so we don't have to purchase that separately. That is a nice upgrade!\n\nMost of the apps that you can purchase for this Leap Pad have at least SOME educational value. Sure, there are some that are purely for entertainment, but I think Leap Frog seems committed to marketing this product on the established foundation that their devices are first and foremost for fun, but educational purposes. One feature I can appreciate about this new LeapPad is that it can run all of the apps we previously purchased for the Leap Pad 2. While these games may now be \"old\" and have lost some of their appeal, at least we didn't have to start from scratch to build a new game library. No more mini-cartridges to keep track of! Now it's all downloadable apps!\n\nOverall, the Ultra an improvement over the Leap Pad 2, but it is questionable as to whether or not it justifies the significant bump up in price. If you don't already have the Leap Pad 2, I would recommend this one, instead. If you already own the Leap Pad 2, you should be just fine sticking with that device."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "I have a 3 1/2 year old daughter.  Like most kids her age, she is tech savvy.  She has had a LeapPad2 for several months, and now this new and improved LeapPad Ultra.  In addition, we have an iPad mini and a Kindle Fire HD.  Those devices are not hers, but she is allowed to play with them sometimes.\n\nIn many ways, the LeapPad Ultra is an improvement over the LeapPad2.  The display is considerably larger, 7\" in comparison to 5\".  There is a built in rechargeable battery, very limited internet capability, double the internal memory space for apps, improved cameras, and a faster processor.  All of our old downloaded games transferred over to the LeapPad Ultra, and the cartridges that I bought for the LeapPad2 work as well.  I do think that it is rather slippery for a small child to hold, and recommend buying a case for it.\n\nHere is my issue though about \"kid\" tablets.  At the current pricing, the LeapPad Ultra costs almost as much as many \"adult\" tablets.  Here is a comparison:  As of the date of this review, the LeapPad Ultra is $149 and the 16 GB Kindle Fire HD tablet is $199 (it was just on sale recently for $30 less).  The LeapFrog content that you can purchase for the LeapPad Ultra is very good, but it is also quite expensive.  The eBooks are $10 to $20 each, and the games are $5 to $25 each.  Do a bit of math, and you will realize that the cost difference between the two previously mentioned devices will disappear quickly with some book and game purchases.  The Kindle Fire HD has a parental control program available called Kindle Free Time Unlimited.  It is currently $4.99 per month, or $2.99 per month if you are a Prime member.  (There are also plans available for multiple children.)  Kindle Free Time Unlimited is a fantastic feature.  For the small monthly cost, you have access to thousands of apps, games, and books at no additional charge.  You can pick and choose what your child is allowed to access, you can limit access to the internet, and you can even set time limits for various activities.  Since I am a Prime member, I can also allow my child to watch the Prime videos that I choose.  (Over wi-fi only for the videos.)  All of this is controlled by a 4 character parent password, and it took me less than 30 minutes to set up for my child.\n\nSo, to sum it up - if you are convinced that you want to buy a \"kid\" tablet, then I recommend the LeapPad Ultra.  As of right now, I think it is the best kid tablet on the market.  But, if you want to branch out to an \"adult\" tablet that can be totally and safely customized for your child, then I highly recommend a Kindle Fire HD with the added monthly service for Kindle Free Time, and a decent protective case."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "This tablet is more comparable in size to a standard tablet. It is a definite size improvement over the LeapPad 2. I would say that it has almost twice the screen size. I also like that the stylus slides into a hole rather than snapping into a groove like on the LeapPad 2. It's much easier to keep the pen locked in place.\n\n==Pros==\n*Wi-fi is probably the most noticeable improvement on this device. It's wonderful to be able to access the app center or the parent area without having to plug the LeapPad into the computer.\n*Built-in rechargable battery with included cord(this is a MUST)\n*Larger screen size.\n*Design seems more ergonomic and easier to grip and hold.\n*Web Search and App Store features can be disabled in the Parent Center if you don't want your children to have access to them.\n*Compatible with all of the games for the LeapPad 2. I was able to sync the apps we previously had purchased for the Leap Pad2 and use them on the new LeapPad Ultra.\n*Kid/User-friendly - my boys were able to easily figure out how to customize the leap pad.\n*Durable - We've had this for about a month and in that time it has been dropped, banged on the floor, tossed in the bottom of a bag, and it's still up and running. Durability is pretty important when kids are involved and so far everything is still good!\n\n==Cons==\n*The load time is sometimes a little slow. Plan on it taking a good while to load the apps onto the device.\n*My son loves the web search feature (it's essentially just pre-selected you tube videos). Most of them are OK, but I'm not crazy about all of the cover songs, etc. Not totally sure I want my four-year-old singing \"Suit and Tie.\" Maybe I'm a prude, but that's my preference.\n*There have been a few glitches every now and then getting something to load, but it's usually a very minor detail that works itself out if I turn it off and on again.\n*Apps/games can be a little pricey, but we've just learned to wait until things are on sale (they run fairly regular app sales)\n\nThere are a few features we probably won't make use of. The \"Pet Chat\" only lets you use pre-selected phrases (which is just fine), BUT it only works if you are chatting with another person on a LeapPad Ultra in the same room as you. I appreciate that my child can't talk to strangers on the Internet, but we don't know anyone else with an Ultra, and if we have a friend over, I'd probably rather them play with each other rather than sit on a couch touching pre-selected phrases. Again, that's just my personal preference.\n\nFrom an educational perspective, I love that the games and apps help to teach my kids important skills (but there are plenty of games \"just for fun.\" We've loaded a couple hours worth of videos like \"Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood\" and \"Super Why\" which makes the LeapPad Ultra fantastic for road trips.\n\nMy son loves the built in camera. He takes picture with it constantly. As a mom, I love that he can have fun and learn something at the same time (and it's a sanity saver on long road trips). My biggest challenge now is keeping my boys from fighting over it."}

It also has 8GB of internal memory which is 2x the amount of the LeapPad2, and it has a faster processor.\n\nThe huge plus in my book is the included rechargeable batteries.  Kids can play cordless when the batteries are charged, or plug it in and play when the batteries are low.\n\nIt also now has kid-safe web browsing which parents can customize, and if you have more than one child and they both have an Ultra, they can play some games together and use the chat feature.\n\nWe are loving the new Ultra, and are still finding new things to like about it.\n\nOne \"Must-Have\" in our house is the protective gel cover - lets be honest, kids do occasionally drop things or set them down to hard.  While LeapFrog has done a great job of taking these things into consideration, they have provided the protective skins to purchase, and we make a point to get them."}

I am hoping with time there will be a good case for this tablet.\n\nCompared to my daughters LeapPad 2, this does have twice the memory and built in rechargeable batteries which I did not have with her first one but eventually added on. It has a large display area but I don't think that matters to her. Here are my pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n\n* Built in rechargeable batteries\n* Double the memory\n* Easy to set up\n* Game cartridges are the same size, do not have to buy different versions\n\nCons:\n\n* Volume buttons are not as easy to navigate along with power button, they are on the front of the LeapPad 2.\n* Battery charger are different, would have been nice to have universal for LeapPad2\n* Heavy and awkward for any size hands, I prefer the LeapPad2 size in my daughter's hands\n\nI keep both of them charged and accessible to my daughter. She has had the Ultra for weeks now but prefers the LeapPad2; it is easy for her hands and fingers. She tells me the other one is just too heavy and big.\n\nIf you do not own a LeapPad at all, I would suggest the LeapPad2 with power. It comes with the rechargeable batteries and is of smaller size. I think the ultra could have been a better idea if it was lighter, thinner, easier to navigate the buttons. Personally, I do no think the ultra is any better than the LeapPad2 and I am glad my daughter owns the other one. She seems happier with the smaller one as well and that is all that matters."}

This year she started to ask for her own iPad.  My big issue is making the tablet kid friendly, especially with a kid that is smart enough to know how the nanny software works.  None of them worked great, especially for web-surfing.  The Kindle Fire HD was better but it wasn't enough.  Then we got the Leappad Power.  That was great EXCEPT it didn't have wifi, so she still wasn't satisfied.  Thankfully Leapfrog came out with the Ultra.\n\nReasons to upgrade...\n\nLots of memory.  We can finally put ALL of our movies, games, and apps on the device and still not near filling the memory up.\nKid-safe...there is NO iPad or Droid tablet safer for your kids.

Leappad Ultra can play all the games that we have from our Leappad Explorer & Leappad Power.  The iPad can only play newly purchased iStore apps and the Kindle can play Kindle apps, but I have to buy a lot of new apps.\n2. The iPad and Kindle do have learning apps for older children.  Leapfrog has JUST started introducing content for 1-2 graders.  It's great but I'd love to see that continue.\n3. The Leappad Ultra is cheaper than either the iPad or Kindle Fire.\n4. The Leappad Ultra internet limits children to kid safe sites vetted by Leapfrog.  Unlike every tablet, there is no way to view porn.\n\nThe main gripe about the Leappad is that they have a great system but the kids outgrown them in 4th to 5th grade.  I'd love to see some BrainPop type games that older kids would enjoy.  If you have a young child and are looking for their first tablet then this is really a no brainer.  Highly recommended."}

My son especially loves the music app that comes with songs to play. It has WiFi and safe websurfing for kids.  Something else I really loved is that it remembered the apps we had previously purchased for his LeapPad 2 and gave us the option to download them to to this one.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "Some of the reviews of the LeapPad Ultra imply that it has a web browser that lets kids go to kid-friendly sites. This is really very misleading. For instance, you can't type \"pbskids.org\" in an address bar and visit this site. There are only certain topics available to choose from, such as dogs or ninjas. One of the videos available in the \"browser\" instructs the user on how to style their hair like Tinkerbell. I can think of more educational topics available on other websites, if only you could access them.\n\nAs for other complaints, the LeapPad Ultra is slower than LeapPad 2 when booting up and switching between apps, although once you are in the app we have not noticed any delays.\n\nThe one redeeming quality for the LeapPad Ultra is that the rechargeable battery is inside, so you don't have to deal with the 2 battery packs that never quite seemed to be secure in the LeapPad 2.

Here is how it fares in reality:\n\n*Hardware*\n\nThe screen on this is great, probably the best in the entire Leapfrog line. Puts the Leap Pad 2 to shame because it's so much bigger and higher definition.\n\nFeels sturdy. The box claims it is \"drop tested.\" This is important because my kid is Mr. Butterfingers but since we've had it, he hasn't dropped it once, which is amazing. It does have some grippy plastic along the back and sides, which probably helps.\n\nI *really* like that I don't have to mess with batteries. Every night, we plug it in and it's ready in the morning. If we have to recharge it mid-day, it doesn't take long.\n\nWireless is a feature doesn't seem to bring much benefit. All the videos are jumpy and slow to load. If you click on the icon for the web, it says \"Coming soon!\"\n\n*Software*\n\nComes with more apps than the Leap Pad2, some of which are totally useless. The Pet Chat app is one. It requires other children to have this exact app on the Leapfrogs and be in the same room. And then they can't even chat normally, there's only an assortment of pre-written texts that they can choose from such as \"Hi!\" and \"I ate too much.\" My son will never use this.\n\nOne benefit to the Ultra is you can add your own MP3s. On the Leap Pad2, you had to purchase a separate app the plays MP3s in order to have that function.\n\nThis also comes with a calculator, a stopwatch, a calendar and notepad app. None of which my son uses at all.\n\nIn summary, I really do like this item but it seems like you spend a bunch of money getting the Ultra only to have to spend a bunch more on the games and apps (which are not cheap!)Don't get me wrong, the Leapfrog games are neat and fun. My son likes them a lot, and while some are only marginally educational, others do reinforce things that I want him to learn. But the ebooks are $10-$20 each, and the games are $5-$25. You can see how that adds up really quick.\n\nBut of course, this is true with *all* LeapFrog products, not just this one. If you are deciding between the Ultra and the Leap Pad 2, I would slightly lean towards the Leap Pad 2. The extra perks don't seem worth the extra money on the Ultra and since there is currently almost $70 difference between the two models, I would buy the cheaper one so I would have some money for the apps."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "We have had a lot of LeapFrog products around our house, it's the one brand I usually buy when buying 'game' systems and stuff.  But they always had things that I didn't like about them.  I hate when you have to have batteries that go dead super fast (or buy the battery pack you can recharge, but it's way expensive), or I've had some that the touch screen never really worked very well.  I also didn't like that our original LeapPad we have had such a small screen.  This one didn't have any of those issues.  This comes with the regular rechargeable type batteries you'd find in any phone or tablet.  And they last awhile because we took it on a day trip where the kids played with it in the car for many hours and it lasted the full day with still some battery left.  While I still feel the touch screen could use some improvement, it's just not as sensitive as it should be, it is better than the previous products we've had.  The screen on this one is much larger than the other LeapPad's and the whole thing just feels sturdier, like it could be thrown around a bit and not be damaged (it has gotten tossed around a little, but not too much).\n\nI loved that I could hook this up to wi-fi and log into my account and it automatically put the games I had bought for the previous systems, onto this device.  These are the app games, not the ones you buy at the store.  The system allowed us to get one game for free as well and it had a much improved camera and video app.  You could also take pictures of people and then put those pictures onto animals, so you'd see an animal with the persons eyes (for example).  It was something that entertained my kids for hours, and it was included with the system with no extra money needed.  I hate when I have to buy all the games or activities in order for a system to be any good, so this was good- it came with enough stuff that it kept my kids very entertained on our trip.  I think the camera is something that never really gets old.\n\nYou can also use the games (the ones you buy from the store) from the original LeapPad and another system we have (I don't recall which, but it's several years old) so I'm happy that those won't go to waste.  (I seriously hate when I have to buy new games every single time we get a new system, so this is a major plus.)\n\nLike I mentioned before, we got this when we went on a trip.  We actually went and visited my aunt who has no children and hasn't seen a LeapPad before.  She sat down to play with it a little and was amazed at how much SHE liked it.  She's a 50 year old women and she was entertained for hours as well!\n\nYou can buy apps with a variety of games, depending on what your interest is.  I personally haven't bought more since we had a couple from before and then what it came with has been enough.  But when I do buy a game again, it will be an app one because the others are always getting lost.  Especially since once you buy them they will work on the different devices (once you register them).\n\nWe were certainly impressed with this one and I feel like their products just continue to improve.  For me this was a big jump from the previous products we've had and is MUCH better quality."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "My son was very excited to get the new big leappad. It was easy to set it up and download  the apps, and all the cartridge games from his old leappad worked there, too. I was a bit worried they will not look very good on the bigger screen with higher resolution, but they were just fine. Nice crisp pictures.\nOur favorite game is Mr Pencil saves Doodleberg, and my son mostly played this game. The new leapppad is not only bigger, but also it is more sensitive to touch, and it was sometimes frustrating when my son would try to write with the stylus, and accidentally touch the screen with the base of his hand or with his other hand. Another favorite was Thomas the train interactive book.\nUnfortunately, the leappad broke just after one week of use - the screen shattered. The good news - it is covered with a plastic film, and there were no sharp pieces. The device was still able to turn on. I contacted LeapFrog company, and they told me that accidents like that are not covered by warranty, but they would replace the leappad for us this one time. I was really impressed by that, didn't expect them to do it. They had me write return authorization number on the screen, make a picture and email it to them. Then they sent me a return label. Hope the new one comes fast. I am not sure what exactly happened to the leappad (maybe my son dropped something on the screen?) and why did it broke, is it because the new bigger screen is more fragile? The previous smaller leappad is still alive with the same (rough) kid user. The new leappad is also much heavier.\nI really liked that you can download the pictures or videos your child made on the leappad, and you can delete unneeded ones from the device using your computer.\nOverall, it is a wonderful device, with a lot of fun educational content available, and the customer service is really great.\n\nEdit: The replacement came. It has different AC adapter - smaller white rectangular one, not big green and round. I like it better - it is easier to find a space on the power strip for it to plug in."}

This product is a step up from the Leappad2.  It has a 7 inch screen instead of the 5 inch and has higher resolution.  It also has a faster processor and storage on the device jumps from 4MB to 8MB. Also like the fact that it has a rechargeable battery as I disliked having to keep replacing the batteries on the other Leappads.  I also like the fact that the games for the other Leappads will work on this one.  They offer lots of different games and ebooks that are for different ages.  Again my family really likes these products and will continue to buy products offered by Leapfrog.  My only problem is that I wish they would have put in a better camera but that is not a big problem.  Maybe next time."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "We are very happy with our LeapPad Ultra.  The wifi was very easy to set up, only took 10 mins top to get it running.  It came charged up with enough juice to set it up and even play for a couple of hours before it needed its first charge, which is always a plus, when you have impatient kiddos.  One of the reasons I really wanted this version of the leappad was so that I could easily purchase and upload games and apps without having to plug into the computer.  Unfortunately, the LeapFrog site and purchasing process was a pain in the butt using the screen.  Typing on it was a nightmare, I felt like it took me 3 times as long as it should have.  It was very frustrating.  That is my only complaint.  Otherwise, it has been working great!  I know it says for ages 4 and up, however my 2.5 yr old is able to easily navigate the ebooks without a problem!  I think that this is definitely the LeapPad to get, if you are in the market for one!\n\n**Update** we have now had the leap pad ultra for several months, it is perfect!  It has gone on airplanes, vacations, road trips. My son loves it. The battery charge lasts forever!  He used it on a 2.5 plane ride and for 2 weeks while on vacation and it still didn't need a charge. If you are in the leap pad market get this one, it is so worth it! We couldn't be happier. He is not 3 yet and even so he gets so much out of it!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "I have to say I am loving the new Leappad Ultra, my Son may not be getting this one back (Just Kidding).\n\nAt $149 the Ultra is not cheap, it's almost in the price range of a Nexus 7 but the Nexus 7 would open up your kids to a whole world of things that you might not want them to see.  The Leappad ultra is a Kids safe device that allows internet access and many other activities but only on sites that are Kid safe and it can only download kid safe learning apps and games.\n\nOut of the Box The Ultra is impressive, it's Heavy, it's solid and it certainly feels like something that will last.  I suspect Leapfrog knows this and that's why they give you a full 1 year warranty.  When have you bought a Toy for your Kid that came with a 1 year warranty??\n\nPowering up the Ultra you instantly notice a super bright screen with pretty good resolution and Color. It beat all my expectations for screen quality instantly.\nThe next thing was connecting it to my Wifi network which was surprisingly easy and painless.  It pretty much uses the standard screens you see with all devices so you should have no problems.  Next you setup your kids account and set that magic 4 digit Pin code that prevents them from purchasing Apps and Games without getting your consent.  All of this worked really well and on top of that you get one free app.  Most  apps are in the $5+ range, which sounds expensive but it's not because kids will play each one of these games for days and days and the best part is that they are designed to teach not just entertain so it's money well spent.\n\nQuick Technical Specs:\n2 cameras, front and back (2 Mega pixels but they do take pretty good pictures)\nBoasts 9 Hour battery life but my son gets about 7\nMp3 Player that pretty good and can get fairly loud.\nBuilt in stylus with strap\nFirmware is auto upgradeable via the WiFi\nReally rugged design, that's well thought out and very nice looking.\n\nNegatives:\nI did see a few lookups of the unit, not too many that I would worry and Leappfrog has already sent a firmware update that fixed some of that, so I expect by Christmas it should be very stable.\n\nFinal Comments:\nIf you can afford it, get it! I suspect that this unit is going to be this year's hot Christmas seller.  It's really good, the screens are clear and bright, the games are fully interactive and it really talks up a storm and gives the kids a lot of enjoyable interaction.\nBTW Ultra owners can play along with other kids that have an Ultra and they can chat to them.  Overall a very good investment that should last a long time, this is not some toy that will be put down 2 months later, this is the kind of toy a kid will use for a long time."}

The tablet froze after 2-3 hours of use.\n\nLeapFrog was VERY GOOD at replacing the tablet, even paid shipping to have the original tablet shipped back to them.\n\nI like it having a rechargeable battery; saves on batteries.\n\nThe applications are cute and fairly easy for the child to use. For example our son uses the silly camera application which puts his or other people's face in place of animals. You can even save the pictures to a regular computer to share or print out. The tablet appears to be well thought out and enjoyable.\n\nI do recommend the tablet and I am sure with time more applications will be available."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "My 5-year old and I were eager to give the new LeapPad Ultra a try and compare it to the LeapPad 2 which we already owned and loved.  Straight out of the box the tablet is noticeably heavier and clunkier feeling than the LP2.  I realize they were trying to make this version bigger and feel more like an adult's tablet but for little hands it can be a bit much - I think it would have more appeal to older kids.\n\nSince we already had an account set up with LeapFrog, all I had to do was run LeapFrog connect and sync the tablet which took nearly 30 minutes - be prepared to spend some time on this when you first get it, especially if you are not already registered with LeapFrog.\n\nOnce the tablet was synced my daughter didn't waste any time exploring and checking out all of the features.  The tablet comes with 11 apps - my daughter really enjoys the Pet Pad Party and the MP3 player and the kid-safe search browser. It definitely feels to her like she has a tablet like Mommy and Daddy's now.  My biggest complaint is that compared to the LP2 this one seems painfully slow.  Anytime you click/tap on the screen to go to a new app or change something, or when you turn the tablet on or off it seems to take forever.  The LP2 was not nearly this slow.\n\nMy favorite feature of the tablet is by far the rechargeable battery - after about 8 hours of use we can plug it in and charge it, so nice to not have to keep buying batteries!  I also really like the little hidden compartment to slide the stylus into.  The camera and video features are easy and fun to use - my daughter had no problem figuring these out fairly quickly.\n\n We were very disappointed to learn that the Hello Kitty game app that we had downloaded just a few weeks earlier for the LP2 was not (yet) compatible with the LeapPad Ultra.  While most of the apps are compatible with the LPU, be aware that not all of them are.  I made a comment on LeapFrog's Facebook page about the problem and they commented that they are still working on making all of the existing apps compatible and in the near future we should be able to use the app we had purchased on the new tablet.  Encouraging news, but frustrating when we had just paid $20 for an app that didn't get played much before the upgrade to the newer tablet.  This is the only game we've encountered with this problem, although there may be others - check the game description before buying the apps.\n\nWe have not had any issues with charging the tablet or using the Wi-fi connection, no freezing or crashing as long as you are patient with how slow the tablet moves.\nMy daughter said she prefers the LeapPad Ultra over the LeapPad 2.  If it weren't for how incredibly slow the LeapPad Ultra is, I would agree 100%.  Children's wants are obviously different from the parents, so take everything into consideration before making a purchase."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "I wanted to get my 5-year old daughter a tablet of her own.  She likes watching movies and playing games on my iPhone, but that just seems like mindless entertainment for the most part.  The app store has lots of content (perhaps too much!), and I did not have a way of determining which had real `educational' value and which were just fluff.  So, off looking for a kids' tablet I went.\n\nI was surprised to learn how many kids' tablet options there are, all in the $100-150 range - we looked into the Nabi's, the InnoTab, the Tabeo, the Kurio, the Contixo, etc.  The reviews were generally pretty poor for all but the LeapPad and InnoTab products, so we bought one of each to try them out.  We wanted to get the newest product available, so our comparison was of the LeapPad Ultra and VTech InnoTab 3S, which on paper are very similar - both offer WiFi, rechargeable batteries, a kid-safe browser, have a headphone portal, have a 2-way 2-pixel camera, etc.  What follows is how we thought the 2 products compared, and not to spoil the surprise ending but we returned the InnoTab and LOVE the Ultra.\n\n[As a side note, we got an early Ultra that had the software issue many have referred to here.  As soon as we connected to the WiFi it corrected itself, but that was an issue for the first day we had the device.... I think LeapFrog could have handled that a bit better, personally.]\n\nWHERE DOES THE INNOTAB 3S HAVE AN EDGE OVER THE ULTRA?\n-Price, clearly - as the Ultra is an extra $50.  This is the big one - if I wanted a device and had $100 to spend, feature-for-feature this is hard to argue with.\n\n-The buttons are on the front of the device, which makes them more accessible and easier to use than the Ultra's, many of which are on the sides of the device.  So, on the Ultra, you had to flip the device over to access the volume, for example...this is a pain.\n\n-The InnoTab has the option to add external memory, as I understand it.  This is pretty cool, I suppose, but I've used <8gb of my iPhone's memory; does my 5-year old really need more memory than that???\n\n-Startup was a couple seconds faster with the Innotab; same with loading games - very modest edge here, but an edge nonetheless.  [The sub point here is that both are crazy slow compared to what we're used to on our phones/tablets.]\n\n-The InnoTab comes with more pre-loaded software.  The Ultra comes with 11 pre-loaded apps, while the InnoTab comes with 20.  Most of the software seems similar (Art Studio, for example).  FWIW, the apps that were included on the InnoTab and not the Ultra I was not impressed with...but nonetheless there are more of them.\n\n-Despite having only one camera, the InnoTab's camera swivels, which is easier to use and cooler than the Ultra's 2 cameras, in my 5-year old's opinion.  Both cameras are total garbage, truth be told...this is a big disappointment with both devices given how much the camera gets used.\n\n-The touch pad on the InnoTab seems a bit more responsive than the one on the Ultra.  The difference here was modest, but still worth noting as I am trying to be as objective as possible.\n\n-The InnoTab is a bit lighter than the Ultra (but we have not had any complaints here at all about the weight of the Ultra from our daughter).\n\n-The other difference, which I am not sure is a positive or negative, is that the Ultra's batteries are internal, like on an iPhone (so you can't change them out ever, as near as I can tell).  Recall years ago AAPL came under fire when the internal battery would just expire over time and you could not replace it?  Same here, potentially.  The InnoTab allows you to buy new battery packs for $35, which is probably a nice option to have.\n\nAND WHERE DOES THE ULTRA HAVE AN EDGE OVER THE INNOTAB?\n-The Ultra has a bigger screen - about 2 inches bigger than the InnoTab's (5\" vs 7').  Side-by-side the picture quality is much better on the Ultra.  I am not sure if it is a result of the size of the screen or what, but the screen is just better/clearer/brighter on the Ultra.\n\n-The Ultra has a progressive battery light indicator, which is nice.  The InnoTab just lights up when the power is getting low.\n\n-The stylus that comes with the Ultra comes attached with a tether, and the InnoTab's is not.  Without it being attached it won't take a kid long to lose this thing.\n\n-I mentioned above that the Ultra is heavier; the pro here is this thing feels like it is one solid piece, and that you could drive over it with your car and not hurt it.  The InnoTab seems much less solid, and feels more `plasticy'.\n\n-The way the 2 devices are put together (like the button fit, for example) is night and day.  In this regard the InnoTab is like a '78 Chevy Nova compared to the Ultra's BMW-like fit-and-finish; the Ultra feels like you could submerse it under water and have it be fine...not so with the InnoTab.\n\n-The Ultra comes with more `built-in' memory (8gb).  But, as notes above, the InnoTab's 4gb is augmented by a card slot.\n\n-When I used the InnoTab for a while it got warm, the way my iPhone does....not like it'd burn you, but still it seemed odd that a kids toy would get hot.  This has never happened with the Ultra, which we've been using for over a month now.\n\n-The backing of the Ultra is rubber, so it does not slide around when it is on a flat surface.  A small `nice to have', compared to the InnoTab's back which is plastic and slides around on the table in the car or wherever.\n\nWHAT ABOUT CONTENT?\nFirst, downloadable apps\nInnoTab.  There are a total of 130 downloadable apps on the VTech site, and prices range from $2.99 to $4.99 for each.  Most of these titles (>50%) are not licensed, meaning the characters are VTech-created.  The higher-priced apps are typically for licensed character(s), but there are not that many (they are all Sesame Street or Disney/Pixar).  LeapFrog has the edge here if your kid wants to play games with specific characters, as they have a broader selection of the various Sesame Street and Disney/Pixar characters, as well as Thomas the Train, My Little Pony, Spider Man, Sponge Bob, Dora, Fly Guy, Clifford, and Hello Kitty, to name a few.\n\nUltra.  Really too many apps to count, at least effectively.  They break their apps into categories (Reading and Writing, Math, Science & SS, and Creativity & Life Skills) - in R&W alone I counted 123 apps.  I don't know how many total apps Leap has, but it is a lot.  Note that the prices here start at $5, where there is plenty to buy....but they also go all the way up to $25, as these apps are the same content as is offered in the cartridges you buy at Target, Toys-R-Us, or here on Amazon.  So, in that regard, it could be said that VTech offers [at least some] less expensive content.  I think this is probably a misleading blanket statement, but Leap offers nothing at the $2.99 price point.\n\nOne last point here: Leap sends me a discount code about every week (25% off, buy 3 get one free, etc.), and on Amazon there are deals too - so don't be turned off by the fact that the Leap games seem more expensive!  This past week I ordered 2 of the $25 games on Amazon and they set me back a mere $22 total, delivered to my door!\n\nSecond, Game Cartridges\nAgain, this is what you can buy when you go to Target or Toys-r-Us, or on Amazon, and in-all I count 62 games offered on the LF web site (and a host of other e-books and such).  VTech has a total of 14 game cartridges as far as I can tell on their site - I believe 62 versus 14 is an apples-to-apples comparison.  All this content (VT's and Leap's) is offered on their respective web sites at $24.99/ea., and it looks like most (all?) can be purchased on Amazon for ~$15 per game.  In the game cartridge arena VT does have some additional characters despite the few titles offered (I saw Hello Kitty and Sponge Bob).  I'd also note that every game cartridge that is offered by VTech is also available for the Leap (I believe).\n\nONE LAST CONTENT OBSERVATION\nOne last observation I made in spending time on the companies' web sites is that Leap seems to be gaining traction building a `community' of reviewers, much the way Amazon has over time.  So, when I wanted to buy a math app, I could read reviews for many/most of the products offered, and in many cases even watch an online preview video - with so many choices, this I thought was great.  As an example, I just randomly clicked on the Cinderella Ultra eBook, and there are 21 reviews on the LF, 20/21 recommends the product, and it gets an average of 4.7 stars.  That's valuable info to me as a shopper, and is a big part of the reason I use Amazon so much - there are very, very few reviews of any of the VTech content.\n\nBOTTOM LINE\nTo bottom line it, I'd buy the Ultra 100 times out of 100 versus the InnoTab 3S.  There are some advantages to the 3S, as noted above, but for a well-built piece of `educational' equipment with lots of app/game/content options, I can't see passing up the Ultra."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "I purchased the original leappad for my children and was really impressed with the unit. My boys love it so when the leappad ultra was announced I preordered two of these believing they would be vastly improved from the Original leappad & leappad 2. Sadly I was wrong - an expensive mistake! The unit sounds impressive and is certainly robust enough for children. However the unit, which is claimed to be faster, appears as fast as the original leappad. As another reviewer has said it appears the operating system can't keep up and I suspect they're right. One of the advances from the first two leappads is the kids safe wi-fi functionality. The way the contents is filtered and presented is good, in fact for young kids I'd say it's fantastic. However it is limited to pictures and video and this is where the unit really falls flat on its face. The video is presented in a small box, not full screen, and is of low quality. Further more the system struggles with most of the videos meaning the unit continuously crashes and goes back to the main screen. I've updated the firmware and have fibre optic broadband (as well as a host of other devices perfectly functional with video). As the wifi & screen size are the two biggest distinguishing features, setting it apart from the older versions, I'm somewhat surprised leapfrog hasn't ensured the user experience is more reliable. If you're buying for the games then this unit is great but possibly better to save some money and just get the previous leappad. If you're thinking of upgrading, or want it for the wi-fi content, I'd wait and see if leappad do anything about improving the user experience and ensuring the system does not crash on videos they've approved! All in all I've spent a lot of money on two systems that the kids are just going to be frustrated with because of it keep crashing. I have contacted leapfrog but had no real help. In fact they appeared surprised by me stating I had a problem with the system crashing. HELLO, guys, you've seen the reviews!!! And NO the firmware update hasn't helped! overall a poor device, poor support & poor customer service."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "I was sent the Leapfrog Ultra for the purposes of this review, however all opinions are my own.\n\nMy son has the LeapPad 2, and it's been a favorite around here since he got it. When we heard about the LeapPad Ultra, it was a no brainer that we needed to try it out!\n\nWhile the LeapPad2 was hard to improve upon, the Ultra somehow managed. One of my favorite features is the ability to connect via Wi-Fi to download apps. I always found it annoying having to connect to the computer & run the LeapFrog Connect software every time I wanted a quick new game for my son, so being able to download new apps on the device is a huge plus. &That Wi-Fi isn't just good for downloading apps- you can play with other LeapPad Ultras that way! There's also a kid-friendly browser that can access ONLY websites pre-selected by LeapFrog, so your kids can have fun browsing the web without you having to worry.\n\nWe have two Ultras, and so I was able to race against my son in one of the racing games. It was so much fun to actually be able to interact with him while he played! It also was a great demonstration on how the LeapPad games cater to your child- we each used separate units, and in the beginning of each round it would ask you to identify numbers. My son, being just barely 4 years old, knows his numbers to about 20. The questions on his unit reflected that, asking him to identify those numbers he already knows. Mine, however, adjusted after the very first round because of how quickly I identified those numbers. Soon it went to the twenties, then the thirties, and then bigger numbers! It only took a couple of rounds to show just how quickly & perfectly the games customize themselves to suit your child's level. They aim to teach further without challenging so much that they discourage the child, and that is definitely achieved.\n\nThe screen is beautiful on the LeapPad Ultra- it's 7 inches and hi-res, and the child version of myself that had a green-lit game system is incredibly jealous. Per usual, it has an incredibly kid-friendly design {which my son seems to want to test repeatedly as he drops this thing far too often} and includes the double camera as well. I like that you barely have to tap things on the screen to get them to work- it's not overly sensitive but you don't have to push down hard, which is great for little hands. &Thanks to the Wi-Fi, you can access over 8,500 games, eBooks & more, including all educator-approved & educator-created content- so no more bored kids!\n\nThe LeapPad Ultra is intended for kids 4-9 but many games cater to even younger children. The Ultra really is fun for the whole family!"}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "My daughters love playing with my tablet and phone, so I decided to get this product because I figured if the worst happened and they destroyed the tablet they were playing on, at least it wouldn't begin with an *i*.\n\nThe tablet is sturdy and well suited for younger kids. My girls are not overly rough with it and are in general easy with their toys, so this has not been put through the worst kids can do, but its survived some bumps and drops.\n\nThe main drawback is the assortment of apps that is included are not that great. For example, one of the apps is the *welcome* message. I realize that buying the tablet is almost the least expensive part, that buying the apps and cartridges are part and parcel of the territory, but I really do not like having this huge selling point being a large selection of apps to begin and those apps being near worthless. Granted, there are a couple that my kids love, but overall it was a gimmick and I resent it.\n\nThe other problem is loading and switching between apps and pages takes forever. There is quite a bit of lag time, enough my kids have asked if there is anything wrong with the machine, and I need to tell them to be patient.\n\nSo overall I'm not unhappy that I got this. My kids enjoy it and I enjoy not worrying about if it gets broken or not. Just be prepared to shell out for apps from the very beginning."}

We keep getting the same picture to connect to the PC which we have done.  Than it restarts and says it is searching for wifi.., 3 times. It asks us to restart our profile and than is searching for wifi and freezes,  We bought a warranty, but at this point I just want my money back!!  She is disappointed and so are we!!  We work too Leap frog, I wish I worked where they do that have bankers hours for customer support.  There should be a live chat feature for such a high tech company."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "We upgraded to the LeapPad Ultra from LeapPad 2 last month after being sent two free Ultras from LeapFrog.  It took a few days of my 3 and 4 year old to get the hang of the new system.  The software was pretty slow to load at first, but that seemed to smooth itself out within a week and the load times are much quicker.\n\nThe best part about the new tablet is the size.  The screen is much bigger and sharper.  Some of the standard games have really fun upgrades to them, too.  The Pet Pad and Chat is fun for both my kids.\n\nWith the Ultra, you can compete against other Ultra owners in certain games.  My 4 year old really enjoyed racing his Grandpa in the Turbo game.\n\nNot sure that I would upgrade just for the Internet feature right now as they are still working out some bugs, but the current videos pulled from YouTube are really fun for my 4 year old to watch.  He has already learned a lot about planets from watching them.  Can't wait until the full features of the Internet are ready!\n\nBut the size of the screen is enough reason in my book to upgrade.  Plus, all the apps will transfer from LeapPad 2!"}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "We recently received two LeapPad Ultras for review purposes. This is my honest opinion on the devices.\nThings we love:\n- Rechargeable battery. So much more convenient.\n- Download apps to the device without physically connecting it or dealing with installing software.\n- Upload game data to the Learning Path without connecting the device physically to a machine or installing software.\n- Play MP3s.\n- Multi-player and chat components which grow the device from solo play to social play.\n- Increased storage (8GB) - more apps!\n- High resolution, bigger screen.\n- Safe Internet access for kids (right now, it's just curated videos, but more content is coming).\n\nThings we don't love:\n- Connecting to the computer to add MP3s.\n- The weight - it feels hefty, and may be too much for small hands.\n- The speed. It may have a faster processor, but it doesn't feel like it. This is my biggest gripe.\n- The cost of the apps (see below). It's not that they aren't worth it, but that doesn't make them more affordable.\n\nCost of LeapFrog Apps- As an educator, I know that LeapFrog creates some of the most powerful educational software available for kids. Unlike most of the 99 cent apps you'll see on an iPad, LeapFrog games/apps are created by an experienced education team, tested with kids, and geared toward the common core standards kids are expected to master in school. The games level up as kids play, so they can be enjoyed over time and continue to be a challenge. Also, as kids play across games in their LeapFrog profile, the device will know if a child has mastered a skill in another game. Most parents don't see this at work, but it's there (and it's why you should never sneak in a game on your child's profile!) So, the games and apps are pricey. It's for a good reason.\n\nMy overall assessment is that we loved the upgrade to the Ultra, but I'm not sure if it's worthwhile to upgrade a mid-range child who already has one of the newer LeapPads, especially if you aren't going to purchase two (so they can play with/talk to) each other. For kids just starting out or families with younger, this is a good investment. You may just save the cost different in batteries alone!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "We have the leappad2, as well as ipod touch, iphone 5, ipads, nintendo ds, and some consoles. So our 7 and 9 year old have played on a variety of units, including ones more geared toward adults and older kids.\n\nThe Leappad 2 my 7 year old received for Christmas last year. It is still getting used 9 months later and still holding up well. My daughter likes the music playing function and camera's on it. She and my 9 year old son though still play games on it as well. Screen size, resolution, and replaceable batteries are its biggest drawbacks.\n\nThe Leappad Ultra addresses those three main concerns. Bigger screen, more resolution, and built in batteries.  This one went to my 9 year old son. It set up easily over Wi-Fi and took about 2 hours to fully charge. First day we had a car trip and between playing at home prior to the trip and the 4 hour trip, the battery lasted about 8 hours. It takes the same cartridges we already had for the Leappad 2 so he had plenty to do. He has never complained about any lag time or any other issues in the week he has had it now. It seems fairly robust and hopefully will hold up as well as the Leappad 2 has. He says he likes it a lot and he is on the older end of the spectrum. He still likes the other choices he has and won't choose the Ultra exclusively, but he does play it get a lot of use from it so far. Like his Nintendo DS, the biggest drawback is game prices. You get spoiled grabbing iphone or android aps for a buck (or free) where here you need to pay more as the development costs don't have such a large audience to recoup them from. We grabbed most of ours when we see them on clearance to minimize those costs.\n\nOverall a nice unit and good upgrade over the Leappad 1 and 2."}

Its educational, child proof/durable, and also fun.  I don't have to worry about anything when he is using it.  He can't buy anything or see videos he shouldn't be seeing.  I don't understand when parents give little kids their own \"REAL\" tablet and/or iPhone its crazy.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "It really amazes me how technology continues to improve and LeapFrog has really taken all our concerns and wishes and rolled them into the LeapFrog Ultra gaming tablet for kids. We also own the first two LeapPad and the LeapPad2 both which my boys still played with all the way up until we received the LeapPad Ultra's.  I have two boy ages 5 and 7 and they don't always get along but they love playing games together. The Leappad Ultra offers peer to Peer gaming which means they can play against eachother if they are in the same room. There's a really wonderful chat feature too. The equivalent of phone texting but for kids. They love being able to text chat eachother through the device. My 7 yr old really wasn't into the LeapPad tablet until this model came out and now he loves it. It's 2 inches bigger, has a higher resolution, and even more memory than the original Leapfrog LeapPad and Leappad2. It has more of the appearance and size of a regular tablet so kids love it even more.\n\nOne of the top features that I really love is that the rechargeable batteries that are built inside! NO additional purchase required. The batteries seem to last a lot longer too. There's additional things like car adapters and screen protectors that are also available for purchase and I'm adding those to the top of my list to pick up.\n\nWe love that all the content that we've already paid for is transferable right onto this tablet so we still get everything they loved playing on the previous tablets on the Ultra. WiFi access on the top is spectacular so no more plugging into the lap top or computer in order to transfer games. You can go to a coffee house or store that offers free wifi and set up that way.\n\nYou get 11 apps for free on initial purchase and of course you can always let relatives know that they can purchase additional games and apps on line for the convenience of gift giving. Our relatives love that!\n\nMy 5 yr old's favorite is the Pet chat. He just loves animals and this game gives him the giggles. Photo taking along with video making is also his favorite. He loves video taping parts of shows he loves, games he plays, and of course conversations we have together. He even video taped me singing his good night songs so that he can watch and play it over and over again and I only have to sing 1 round. (isn't that the sweetest?)\n\nMy 7 yr old loves the tilt game play action and I think this is something that really pulls him in as a huge fan of the LeapPad Ultra. The calendar also allows him to put in after school activities that he participates, shows he doesn't want to miss, playdates scheduled, and birthdays. He has access to his own calendar and he loves it. I think that's pretty neat.\n\nThis tablet is highly durable and stands up the the drop test over and over again. That's something you don't get with other Tablets. My 5 yr old used to have a terrible issue with throwing things when he was mad and no matter how often he tossed the LeapPad it always worked when he picked it back up. For that reason I'm a HUGE fan of LeapFrog sturdy case that covers the tablet.\n\nLoad time has never really been an issue for my boys. Sure you'd like things to load immediately but a few seconds longer have never been an issue. It teaches them patience and that's a good thing. At this point I'm really wondering what other exciting upgrades could even be possible. I think LeapFrog hit a Home Run with this one.\n\nI received (free of charge) 2 LeapPad Ultra Tablets to test out all features of the new tablet with my boys. Thoughts are always 100% my own and no other compensation other than watching the joy on my boys faces when they enjoy playing games together on these two devices was received."}

The LeapPad Ultra doesn't disappoint. The screen is a fantastic size--think iPad mini. The wifi access makes learning endless. Instead of blocking what comes in--LeapPad only allows the good stuff in. Wifi access allows for peer to peer play so you can play friends or classmates in education games. I also love that the LeapPad Ultra comes with the chargeable batteries built in and a LeapPad Ultra charger. The stylus is built in better, sliding completely in a hole for more convenient storage. My 4 year old spends hours drawing on his LeapPad Ultra, which he never did on the LeapPad 2--I think the larger screen is the reason. He really loves his LeapPad Ultra and will play on it for a long time independently. I cannot wait to explore more games."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "I was trying to decided whether to buy an Innotab 3s, Leappad Ultra, or Leappad 2 Power for my 3 year olds.  I couldn't decided so I bought all 3 to try them out.  I thought we would want the Leappad Ultra but it was really slow and crashed a lot.  My husband and I both thought the time it took to load apps was ridiculous.  Plus we didn't want a tablet that was going to crash all the time.  Also the touch screen wasn't sensitive enough.  It also had way too many apps that my kids weren't going to use and would just frustrate them if they were on an airplane.  I wish I could have customized the home screen to take off so of the apps that we wouldn't use on an airplane or use right now.  We loved the pet game it came with.  The wireless internet seemed almost useless as it was really slow and didn't have that many options.  Plus we want the tablet mainly for when we are traveling.  Downloading apps on the wifi was also really slow so I preferred to just sync in to my computer for downloading apps.  I also thought the Leappad Ultra was bigger and bulkier than it needed to be.  The Leappad Ultra ended up being our least favorite of the 2.  Overall we ended up returning it and are much happier with the Leappad 2.  The Leappad 2 has a faster response time and less apps that our kids don't want to use.  Plus I can take some of the apps it comes with off of it for now.  It also is a better size for our kids.  The only advantage the Leappad Ultra has over the Leappad 2 power is the extra storage space to hold more games."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "Leapfrog has always been one of the front runners when it comes to children's educational technology. Now they bring you their second generation children's tablet, the LeapFrog LeapPad Ultra. Unlike the previous Leapad, and Leappad 2, the Leappad Ultra truly in my opinion deserves the description \"Tablet\". Like all previous editions the tablet is touch screen compatible, it comes with one styluses (which is attached to the tablet itself), AC Adapter, and a LeapFrog USB adapter so that you can connect it to your PC and download applications directly from the Leapfrog Server Website as well as charge the Tablet itself.\n\nThe tablet is medium-lightweight and easy for a child or adult to carry from place to place. It is backwards compatible with all Leapfrog Explorer cartridge games as well as most original Leappad downloads (I don't believe the micromods work with the Leappad Ultra) .  The Leapfrom Downloads are extremely child friendly and great for any child ages 3-10.  My 6 year old daughter absolutely loves this and plays it a couple hours a day, as well as my 3 year old son. This has not only increased both of my children's vocabulary but has taught my daughter how to trace letters and now she's writing very well as well as improved her addition and subtraction.\n\nI absolutely love this as an extra educational aid, and now they've finally fixed my one big issues with the previous models which was the constant use of batteries. The Leappad Ultra like an Ipad or Android Tablet can easily be plugged into your computer to charge or use the AC adapter. There is also a Car Charger which you can purchase separately for educational fun on the go!. When fully charged will last up to 9 hours which is plenty of time for educational fun.\n\nSo what's the difference between the Leappad 2 and the Ultra? Well The Leappad 2 and Ultra both come with front & back cameras/video recorders, however the Leappad 2 has 4gb of memory versus the 8 gb you get with the new Leappad Ultra. Also the New Ultra has kid Safe Wifi powered by the Zui network which is limited to kid friendly topic and interests. The Ultra also has upgraded the screen to a new 7 inch HiDef 1024x600 as well as improved the processor/computing speed. Everything else is exactly the same.\n\nAs a bonus Leapfrog gives you 11 free apps 10 are per-installed and 1 you get to choose from when you register your device.\n\nSo if your kids loved the original Leappad and you're thinking about upgrading and wondering if it's worth it the answer is a Definite Yes! And if you're new to the Leappad this is definitely the one to invest in your kids, nephews, nieces grandchildren will love it!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "I wasn't sure just how different the new LeapPad Ultra would be from the LeapPad2, which we also own, but I was pleasantly surprised!\n\nFor me, the coolest new upgrade is the WiFi. I like that I can add apps and sync content on the actual unit instead of doing it on the laptop and then plugging the LP in to sync. I really, really love the neat new browser b/c it is age appropriate!!! I don't have to worry about my kids clicking on something I don't want them seeing. There are so many cool things for them to explore...and it's educational, no random mess thrown in. And I can turn it off at any time I want.\n\nMy girls were excited to see some pre-loaded apps like the PetChat (they can instant message using the app's pre-selected phrases). My seven year old thought the calculator was cool. She likes math, and it is not my strong-point, so I am encouraging that all the way! They got to try the new Turbo Racing Game and agreed that it was fun...plus they can play each other since we're on the same network (again, yay, WiFi!).\n\nThe only \"negative\" I could see was that the unit seemed to \"think\" for a minute as it went from the Home Screen to a game, but it could also be because it was warming up still.\n\nWe're a family that's very budget conscious these days (really, who isn't anymore?) with a baby on the way. If the price is a turn-off, I really suggest saving up for the Ultra. It would be an awesome Christmas gift, and relatives could make their own shopping easier by purchasing a new game or two to go along with it! We limit the kids' screen time, but they are a real life-saver at doctor's waiting rooms, practices, traffic, etc.\n\n*Disclosure: LeapFrog sent me two LeapPad Ultras for review, but ALL opinions are always my own. I don't review products that I don't care for."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "Despite reading about the quirks in the thread about this product, I went ahead to get this even though I'm currently located outside US. Originally was planning and on the verge to get LP2 but decides LU (thanks to advertisement) for the fact that It has larger and more vivid screen and has built in battery and glad I took this path. My main intention was to get the ultra ebooks and learning games selections to feed my daughter's favorite hobby - reading and thought a larger screen would be more ideal and it sure does.\n\nI've already received 2 firmware updates but they don't seem to have addressed the time lag issue or very rare lockups yet but this is not a major issue for my daughter.\n\nWhat really disappointed me was the non support of leapfrog US on two simple (at least that's how I think) questions on wifi connectivity and apps. I just received a reply stating I'm would not be supported as I'm not located in US. The local distributor has not brought in LU yet and that's the reason why I contacted them. I buy many products from US and all sellers I've contacted have no qualms in answering any of my questions and many extending even greater support for overseas customer though a minority of these responses could be quite in standard service pitch.\n\nWith products selling everywhere globally  (most of leapfrog products are actually made in China) this is totally unacceptable to me for the fact that I'm still a consumer. That could also mean the support team could not answer the 2 basic question which should not take too long. I hope buyers know what they are getting into with LF and for the fact that I've already took risk in this oversea purchase I know I should and could live without the support of manufacturers who already put a high price for their items for even non-support which US residents are complaining about.\n\nIn the meantime, for someone who is already used to the speed of ipad and Samsung tablets, to LF --> please fix the bugs ASAP. Please don't get me wrong, we love the products and have high expectations. Nonetheless I'm also happy amazon brings many useful and exciting products into our lives."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "I purchased this at Best Buy for my 3 year old granddaughter and spent hundreds more on on apps and gear. I gave it to her immediately after it was released this July. She soon fell in love with it; it was by far her favorite toy (and ours) as it kept her amused during car trips, doctor and dentist visits, etc. We had issues from the beginning with the screen freezing, scrambled screens, and slow processes, all of which I could live with since she loved it so much. Today, a little more than 30 days after giving it to her, it is totally dead and will not power on at all. We thankfully purchased a warranty, and are going to exchange it, but I have no confidence the new product will be of any better quality. In addition, all the apps I purchased can only be put on three devices. If I get one more dud, I will not be able to transfer my hundreds of dollars in apps to the new device. This purchase has been the biggest mistake I ever made. Take my advice and purchase an ipad, ipad mini, kindle fire, anything but this.\n\n  Update: Sept. 2,2013.  I returned the original item to the store ( thankfully I purchased an extended warranty) and got a replacement. Two days after exchanging the ultra, the replacement  refuses to charge with the wall charger. Really leapfrog?\n\n  2nd update : Nov. 10, 2013. The replacement has had SEVERAL issues. The entire system has crashed recently, but my daughter was able to repair it, although it took the better part of her very busy day using time she doesn't really have. The system itself (when it is working) is SLOW, SLOWER, OOPS SO SLOW MY GRANDDAUGHTER THREW IT IN FRUSTRATION!  (Perhaps that explains the need for the case to withstand dropping?)\n\ni am more disappointed than ever with the ultra as time goes on. I have also found my granddaughter's taste in apps changes rapidly; she is very fickle. However, I have decided not to purchase another leapfrog app. Rather, I  am looking into just purchasing a Kindle Fire HD for Christmas with its multitude of cheap apps and availability of a low cost monthly subscription to thousands of age-  appropriate children' s apps. I would also purchase a warranty and the toughest case out there.\n\n  I am now going to comment on the manufacturer's comment. ( I' m actually surprised it took me this long). I had already contacted customer support NUMEROUS times before writing this review, trying to give them time to help. Each time I was placed on hold for a completely unacceptable time , ( over an hour in some instances), and given very little true tech support -( for example, one time I was told to \" take a picture of the frozen screen and email it to them and wait for an email reply\". etc., etc.)  Try explaining that to a three year old. In addition, I want to reinforce what others have warned about. Many of the 5 star reviews were written by people who received free ultras. In addition, I believe leapfrog has a program (or contest?) to reward members who leave positive feedback. Whether or not that applies to Amazon reviews, I do not know. I read about the program on leapfrog's facebook page.  BTW, has anyone other than me noticed leapfrog s customer support only seems to comment on negative reviews that many people find helpful?  So sorry leapfrog, I really wanted to like this product but the more time that passes the more disenchanted I become. So much so that I am willing to lose all the (considerable) money I have invested only 3 1/2 months after purchase. Take my advice Christmas shoppers and spend your hard earned dollars elsewhere.\n\n3rd update: thanks again to the extended warranty, I was able to return this thing. With the money I received, I was able to purchase a leappad 2 AND a kindle fire HD. ( thanks to Black Friday deals). I only purchased the leappad 2 so my granddaughter could use the hundreds of dollars worth of cartridges and apps I have already purchased. I bought a Griffin Technology survivor case for the kindle, haven't received it yet. I will update on all after she receives everything this Christmas and has had a chance to use it all.\n\n4th update: dec. 26, 2013: I gave her the leappad 2 a couple of weeks ago because she kept asking where it was. Setup went better than the ultra and  there was enough memory to load all the apps I had already purchased for the ultra.\n\nWhat I don't like about leappad 2:  It also has glitches like the ultra. For example, the screen often freezes on solid green; the only solution is to turn it off and back on again. I had to purchase separate rechargeable batteries and a charger for the leappad 2;  total price for batteries, charger, and leappad 2 was about $29 for everything with  all the coupons and discounts I received; that's about all it is worth. The amount of time required each day to \" fix\" whatever is wrong  at any given moment with either the ultra or the leappad 2 is ridiculous. Any of you who have little ones know they want it fixed NOW!! It's also a big pain to take the batteries out and charge them every night. In addition, the apps are limited and very pricey.  (For example- Max and Ruby videos are about $1.00 per episode for the kindle fire HD if you buy the whole season but are  $2.50 per episode through leapfrog, making leapfrog videos 250% more expensive than Amazon videos. You can buy whole seasons on Amazon but only a few limited episodes on leapfrog).\n\nI gave her the kindle fire HD (2012 edition- paid $99 at Best Buy online ) yesterday in a pink Griffin technology survivor case. (About $30-35 on Amazon).  First impressions of the case- love it! Totally encases the kindle fire with a built in screen protector. It is made to military standards- drop proof from 5 feet, water resistant ( gotta love that for toddlers), has built in stand so she can prop it up and watch it at the table while snacking, even the buttons have protective covering. If it fails in some way I will update but so far seems to be a great investment.\n\n( ***survivor case update: January 30, 2014: my granddaughter dropped her kindle ( in the  Griffin technology survivor case) all  the way down the wooden staircase. The survivor case gave it total protection; her kindle never skipped a beat. I don't think the  leappad  ultra would have survived a fall like that. I now believe the kindle fire in the griffin technology survivor case is sturdier than the leappad ultra.  I have since ordered two more cases- one for hubby's kindle and one for my iPad. )\n\nFinally, an early review of the kindle fire HD. After she used it a couple of times I asked her which \"iPad\" ( she calls every tablet an iPad) she liked better. Her answer- \"the pink one.\" ( kindle). I can't even get her to look at the leappad now. (Which I really don't care about given how poorly their products perform) . Kindle has great graphics, quick response to touch, easy to set up parental controls, tons more apps and videos available at a much better price point, many free things with prime membership, and the ability to grow with your child.\n\n  FYI, I am a retired elementary school teacher who has some knowledge about what kind of apps are good for little ones. One example- puzzles are great to teach spatial recognition and problem solving. Lots of free and low cost toddler puzzles for kindle, really none that I could find on leapfrog.\n  Don't be fooled by the educational \" hype\" leapfrog spouts. If they really cared about education and kids they would make a better product, have customer service available when kids are actually home from school  (they are closed from 3:00 p.m. on  Friday till 9:00 a.m. Monday as well as every night after 5) and  have a much better app selection at an improved price point. Parents don't mind spending money on education as long as they see value for what they spend.\n  My opinion- value for what I spent on leapfrog products- very poor. Value for what I spent on kindle and survivor case- excellent! 'Nuff said.\n\nJune 6,2016\n\nI just wanted the let everyone know that my granddaughter's kindle is still working. However, I upgraded her and her two year old brother to an iPad mini last Christmas. While I liked the kindle, the mini is much more user friendly and has tons of apps that are easy for little ones to use. In addition, I discovered an iPad mini is actually much cheaper than a leap pad when you factor in the cost of leap pad apps.\n\nI put griffin cases on both and they have held up well the first six months of use. Best gift ever!!"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "I purchased this because my older tech savvy child got a kindle fire hd and we knew it was going to cause tension btwn big brother and little brother. The device is slow, it furstrates me with how long it takes, you can imainge what it does to be small toddler. In leapfrogs defense I did purchase this for my almost 3 yr old ,so he lacks the ability to wait for anything. I suppose this SLOW device can serve as a lesson in patience (something most kids lack.) However it is very disapointing to pay so much for something so slow. I truly hope that a simple online update or firmware update will be created in the future to make the device faster. It would be very disapointing to find a newer faster model on the market in 6 mo, it would also be a bad move on leapfrog since so many ppl have made note to how slow the tablet is.\n\nI love leapfrog because they truly do make learning fun,and in selecting for my almost 3 yr old education trumped glitz and glam. The apps for tbe kindle don't hold a candle to those of the leappad ,which is why i don't mind paying for them. I would like to suggest putting some kids movies in the just for fun section if possible and please find a way to make this faster without having to purchase a new device. I can honestly say that my 6 yr old would be over how slow this tablet is, which is why he got the kindle."}

While the changes between the LeapPad 1 and LeapPad 2 were small, the new LeapPad Ultra feels like a true redesign. Physically, the LeapPad Ultra is thinner and easier to hold, but with a larger screen for better visibility. My kids love the swipe-able screen that makes it feel more like the iPad. One of the best new features is the ability to connect via WiFi to other LeapPad Ultras to play games with/against each other. My two older boys love racing each others or having their pets get together to play.\n\nAs a parent, I still love the blend of education and entertainment that LeapFrog has found with their games and apps. Plus, the LeapPad Ultra has a rechargeable 9-hr battery! No more AAs! Woohoo! The one downside - the loading time for apps seems to be a bit longer than the previous LeapPad. Could be my imagination... Overall, a great improvement from early models and a great educational toy for kids.\n\n* I was provided a sample of the LeapPad Ultra through a review program. The opinions expressed are my own."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "My kids got the new Ultras several weeks ago and they really love them.  They feel like they have their own ipads but they are so much more kid friendly and durable.  I love how educational all the games are, unlike with the ipad you can really fill those things with pointless video game apps which kids tend to gravitate towards and have no educational value.  All Leapfrog products have taught my kids so many skills and basic things like alphabet and it's nice to have something educational that they can play when Mom needs some downtime.  I feel like it loads a little slowly and sometimes it turns off for no reason, but other than that we've had no issues.  It's nice that it has a safe WIFI so that you can download apps straight to the Leappad."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "LeapFrog provided me with the LeapPad Ultra to review. As always, the opinions below are mine all mine.\n\nI haven't once been disappointed with our LeapPad2 (which I wrote about last year). So I couldn't believe LeapFrog made it better again this year with the LeapPad Ultra. The top highlights are built-in charging, built-in (secure) WiFi, and peer-to-peer gaming. Keep reading for the full review.\n\nWhat I love about the LeapPad Ultra:\n\n- Bigger, thinner, and more \"grown-up\". I'm totally fine with kid toys looking like kid toys, but for the older child (LeapPads are meant for kids 3-9), a sleeker, more mature looking LeapPad will be a lot more acceptable.\n\n- Built-in charging. And all the parents said, \"yay!!!\" Yes, this does mean that when the battery goes low your child will actually have to take a break from playing while it charges, but it also means you don't have to keep up with rechargeable batteries, buy an additional $40 charger, or change out batteries every day. The trade-off is a higher price tag, but worth it.\n\n- Built-in WiFi. This is a great feature for many reasons. Your LeapPad can get automatic updates and games without connecting to your computer. The WiFi is a parental control and is password-protected. ....and...\n\n- The WiFi also means friends can play certain games together! If they enter multi-player mode, and they are connected to the same wireless network, the LeapPads will find each other so the kiddos can play against (but usually \"with\") each other.\n\n- Age appropriate. As usual, everything that is created by LeapFrog is educationally-driven and age-appropriate. When you connect your LeapPad Ultra, you can see every type of question your child has answered, their success rates, etc. LeapFrog Connect (which I used a lot with our LeapPad2) is a great way to see your child's progress.\n\n- Access to the LeapFrog application store or LeapFrog game cartridges. The games available are all fun and many of them boast the most popular characters in kid media.\n\n- More parental features. I don't think the LeapPad2 had an actual parental mode, but the LeapPad Ultra does, and it means the child can't accidentally delete their own profile or turn on something they're not ready to play with.\n\n- Great value. Even with the higher price, the LeapPad Ultra is an extreme value. Compared to buying your child a non-kid proof tablet, the retail price is a great bargain for a toy that can be used for years to come.\n\nThings that could be improved:\n\n- Handedness. This was a note I made on the LeapPad2 review, too. This time, the stylus is more on the left-hand side of the LeapPad, but if you're right-handed, the stylus cord isn't quite long enough. The games should flip on landscape mode, but it doesn't seem like every game will flip both ways. So I almost want to suggest having your child try it out before buying. Also, I still think LeapFrog should add an optional handedness mode in the profiles that might be useful in some games...\n\n- Regardless, my child almost never uses his stylus. He prefers his finger. Perhaps this is fine because it's where technology is, but I do think it would be nice to have some games where a stylus must be used for certain activities, so that the child can practice holding and using it.\n\n- Although the WiFi access is much more convenient, it does scare me. LeapFrog put its on proprietary \"web browser\" on the LeapPad, but there's not much to it at this point. LeapFrog selects the items that can be viewed instead of trying to filter out what can't. While I like that approach, it means there's very little there, mostly puppy and kitten videos. I think it's up to the parent to keep their password private, but I doubt many parents of older kids will. They'll just say, \"Honey, it's 1243, do whatever you need to do because the dishes need done and I have to change this diaper.\"\n\n- The LeapFrog is meant for children ages 3-9, but it would be nice to have 1 or 2 baby games available. Emma, who's 1, gets very interested in the LeapPad and would love to have a turn. ;)\n\n- The \"bigger and better\" does mean a little heavier. I don't think a child could hold the LeapPad one-handed for very long. My child just sets it down on his lap or a table to play.\n\nOverall, just like with the LeapPad2, I found myself asking for a turn. The LeapPad Ultra is a great value for a technology toy that is spot-on appropriate for kids."}

It is also my brand of choice for birthday gifts. Also before this I have not had any problems with Leap Frog stuff.\n\nI purchased Leap Pad Ultra for my (almost) 5 year old from Barnes and Nobel. He likes it but is upset about the Ultra being slow since he is used to his fast and user friendly Android tablet.\n\nBad:\n- The a/c adapter is not working. Hence once the initial battery charge finished we were stuck with a dead device.\n- The Leappad Ultra is generally very slow, the apps are very slow to start and transition.\n- The apps and the system hang if tapped multiple times (as kids tend to do when apps are slow to load).\n- I am now trying to return it to the retailer (which I hope I am able to since I decided to wait a week to open it and present it to my son). I would really like to re-purchase it if my concerns here are addressed.\n- The screen is not very reactive and stylus does not work well at times with Mr. Pencil. My frustrated kid does not want to use Mr. Pencil anymore!\n\nGood:\n- I did not find it slow in downloading apps from the internet.\n- The app installation process was actually very seamless and I loved it (great UX). My DD wanted Mr. Pencil and Secret Agent U. I logged in on my laptop, bought the app and within minutes it was automatically downloaded, installed and available to my son via wifi on his device. No hassle of connecting the device - very impressive\n\nConcerns:\n\n- What do i do if I am able to return it to the retailer?\n- What do I do about the apps and accessories (I was too fast to purchase form the app center and other places), especially if I do decide not to re-purchase it.\n\nI assume it will be very educational and fun if it worked well.\n\nNids"}

This product falls way below the expectation that LeapFrog sets with its great product line.  It took several seconds (2-15 seconds) to get the device to move from screen-to-screen.  The web browsing is horrible and you can't buy free or low dollar apps the traditional way like on a Kindle or an iPad - the apps on this device are quite pricey and you can't really roam the internet or the app store like you can on a Droid or Apple product.\n\nSimply get a refurbished Mini iPad or Kindle Fire and encase it in an Otterbox for solid, reliable durability... and enjoy all the other advantages of having an iPad (email, web surfing, etc)."}

The quality of videos/ photos is very poor despite all you can do with them.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "Over the years we have owned the Leapster 2, LeapPad, LeapPad 2 and just recently were given the opportunity to test out the Leapfrog Ultra through LeapFrog and I have to say that hands down this is my favorite out of all of them.  I love the fact that all of our past games are still compatible since we know those aren't cheap to purchase and for it to be rechargeable is fantastic!  Over the years we have went through a small fortune on batteries for our LeapFrog products so I'm looking forward to not having to always change batteries.  With continuous play and use of Wi-fi with my kids I have noticed that it's ready for a charge at the end of the day.\n\nDid you catch where I mentioned that it had wi-fi?  Well this is awesome and they kids have a little little internet browser that has videos and all types of things on them.  My six year old always goes in and watches the videos.  I say it's like they have their own kid-friendly youtube area.  The LeapFrog Ultra also allows the kids to sync them so they can now play games against each other. The boys love racing against each other and I catch my husband getting into the fun from time to time as well.\n\nI have noticed a few glitches in the system. They do freeze from time to time which is very frustrating for the boys. This happens on the main board as well as when using the wi-fi channel. Every now and then when my six year old turns his own, the screen upside down. This is happening more and more. It's the main menu screen that does this but once he starts a game it looks fine so I'm not sure what that's about. We have had to reenter the wi-fi password a few times. It will tell the boys that they don't have connection.  The fix appears to be for us to go in and delete our wi-fi password and retype it in. At that point it begins working again. We have had to do this a few times.  I am sure this will be a fantastic option when all the kinks get worked out of it.\n\nOverall I think this is an awesome product that the end result will offer a lot! The boys are reaching for it more and more these days I have noticed. At first they were still going for their LeapPad and LeapPad 2 because of the Pet game.  While this one does come with Pet Pad Party App installed it's a little different. If you have an older child I am going to say go for the Ulta, it is designed for older kids in mind and the LeapPad 2 is a little younger, but with any of these systems you are sure to not be disappointed.\n\n**I was sent this product in exchange for a honest review. The opinions above are my own.**"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "We have both the LeapPad2 and just received the LeapPad Ultra. The LeapPad Ultra screen is bigger and easier (higher resolution) to see and it is also way more durable than the smaller LeapPad2. (It seems to have more cushioning.) There are a TON of apps to choose from in the online library, so we'll use it to select apps based on what we are studying at that time in homeschool. If you have multiple kids and get two, you can play peer-to-peer which and helps avoid those sharing arguments. PLUS, the LeapPad Ultra has a built-in MP3 player, which is really cool. I think the upgrades are well worth the extra cost to get the Ultra. We'll get a lot of FUN learning time out of this with our 5 year old."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "LeapFrog has developed a more sophisticated learning tablet for young children that far outshines any competition!  The new LeapPad Ultra is amazing!  This tablet is loaded with a music player, art and photo apps, basics such as a calculator, notepad, calendar, clock with stopwatch and voice mail features. It is bigger, sturdier and more powerful than the original LeapPad.  This versatile learning tool is one purchase that can grow with a child's abilities and interests with the ease of adding LeapFrog apps. The LeapPad Ultra is well thought through with a 9 hour battery life and wall plug for recharging ease.  As a LeapFrog Teacher Ambassador, I am very fortunate to receive high quality products for use in my kindergarten classroom.  I can hardly wait to begin this school year with the new LeapFrog Ultra!

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "So, if our LeapPad Ultra actually worked - maybe we would have given it more stars for being fun.  But its not much fun to spend hours upon hours working with LeapFrog to try and figure out what is wrong with our device.  It worked for 2 days before hitting a \"Bug.\"  Since then, my daughter looks at it and yells \"I hate this thing.\"  When I was paying $150 for this thing, I stopped and asked myself why I wasn't just saving the money and buying an ipad mini as I know Apple has great customer service.  I should have listened to myself.\n\nWe purchased the Ultra when our Leappad one died.  I was taking the kids on a long trip and thought my daughter might like the upgrade as we made the long trip to Grandma's house.  Right out of the box, the wall charger wouldn't work.  So I had to call and get a replacement sent.  I charged it on my computer and it worked on the way to Grandma's house.  But then, something went wrong.  You can turn it on, the LeapPad screen pops up before going to black.  Its still on, because you can see white impressions on the screen, but that's all you can see.  I called LeapFrog.  The first person I talked to didn't have any idea that they even made the Ultra.  The first thing she told me to do was take out the batteries.  Well, the Ultra doesn't come with batteries - so I asked to speak with someone who knew something about the Ultra.  The next lady, while apologetic, told me it would take 48 hours for them to talk to the developers to try and come up with a fix for the bug I was encountering.  48 hours later, I got an email with a bunch of instructions telling me to log on to the Ultra.  Since it doesn't work, there isn't anything to log on to.  I again went through all of the issues we were having and had to wait another 48 hours for them to get back to me again.  Its gone on this way for 2 weeks and they still don't have any idea what is wrong with their product.  For my inconvenience, they offered me a free app.  Well, that's just great.  What am I supposed to do with a free app when the device the app is for is broken?!?!?  Terrible, terrible, terrible customer service and product.  Save your money and buy an Ipad mini.  If I can ever get my money back for this piece of junk, I will be headed to the Apple store."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "We own the original LeapPad and the LeapPad 2, and a couple of weeks ago LeapPad sent us a LeapPad Ultra to try out.  It is light years ahead of its predecessors!  I feel like Leapfrog actually listened to the feedback they received from parents, because they have addressed many of the issues that I had with the previous versions of the LeapPads:\n\n1)  Rechargeable battery -- I have been wanting this for ages!  Finally, we don't have to spend a fortune on AA batteries after my kids' marathon sessions.  Yes, the battery does add to the weight of the unit, but it's a small price to pay.\n\n2)  Bigger screen -- I love the bigger screen (7 inch versus 5 inch for the earlier versions) because kids don't have the fine motor control to navigate smaller screens.\n\n3)  Wifi capability -- Having wifi makes the LeapPad Ultra even more like mommy's and daddy's tablet, so they spend more time on their own tablet and less time on mommy's and daddy's :) I do think the kid-safe browser is too restrictive, though. I really wish parents could add individual websites to a \"safe list\".  If that website happens to link to another site that is not on the \"safe list\", the link should not work.  Easy Peasy!  Hopefully Leapfrog will address this in future versions.\n\n4)  Peer to peer gaming -- My boys love playing tic-tac-toe and racing games with each other on their separate LeapPad Ultras.  Again, this makes the LeapPad Ultra  a lot more like a gaming console, so kids will still be playing with the LeapPad Ultra at an older age.\n\nI do agree with other reviewers, the app loading time can be quite slow -- but then again, it was slow on the previous versions too.  All in all, I think this is a great investment.  Keep the kids off your tablets by giving them their own LeapPad Ultra!"}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "My daughter has had the Leappad 2 for just under a year.  (I've written a review for that, including that she brings it to bed more often than dolls or bears). Two days ago I placed the Leappad Ultra in her hands...I wished I had video taped it. She was watching the Magic School Bus on the LP2 and I started up on the LPU and handed it to her.  Her jaw dropped, she stopped singing (maybe breathing) and couldn't take her eyes off it. My friend and I were asking her if she liked it, if she's Ok, calling her name... she was in a daze, literally.  About 3 minutes after she was able to respond. \"Mummy I love it I love it l love it...wow wow wow\". She proceeded to investigate the location of the buttons. She wanted to know how all the new (included apps) worked and began clicking on icons. Sometimes I observed her just sitting holding it with a smile. When I inquired she said: \"the game is loading\". The first night she stayed up 2 hours past her bedtime, allowing her to play constantly for about 6-7 hours. No issues... except the loading time which she has not complained about. She has about 16 apps from before. She had re-played more than half. She said \"wonder if this (cartridge) would work\". I left her to try and she came to me with a colorful, grainy frozen screen. I don't know if she removed the cartridge while game on... possible, because when I shut down, insert cartridge and started it was good and she was saying \"I didn't want that cartridge again\". She is 6 years old, by the way. Favorite app is the Pet Party. Her only complaint was that sometimes she doesn't actually touch the screen, but by hovering over it engages the screen and maybe does something she didn't want done. So I guess her LPU is ultra responsive.\n\nAs a parent who waited for the delivery of my pre-ordered LPU and had to read negative reviews from everyone except people who got theirs free, I had 2 thoughts: 1. Why can't I get a free LPU? 2. Hmmm, can't sell LP2 yet. Well ignoring #1, so far the LP2 had been bagged and not missed.\n\nFrom my experience, the registering of the device was reasonably quick - especially since I had a slow connection, but didn't want to wait to get home. LOVE THE WIRELESS OPTION.  The loading of the 23+ apps took less than 1hr (sorry I didn't use stop watch). I like that you could work on it while it charges. So I had everything loaded and had to wait a while before the light indicator changed from yellow to green. I don't like the front camera on the side... harder (relative to LP2) to take self portraits and videos. She hasn't gotten accustomed to it yet, but hasn't spent much time at it. I prefer cartridges to downloads - can be used on more than 3 devices if we need to share. But there is wonderful space on her LPU - under 1GB with 3 screens worth of apps on the device . (Even with the LP2, space utilization was great - never deleted any of our videos or art work, tons of space with 16+ apps)\n\nThe free app is either: Scaredy Cat, Ozzie & Mac ebook or hmmm...I can't remember, except that it was lame and not even an option for me. That loads first.\n\nI have not used the peer-to-peer because there is no one (no free LPU here or nearby). We have not gone online yet so will update when we do. As a parent I don't like her 'access' to the App Centre, to create wish list. I want her content with what she has, and  ecstatic with what she gets... not what she begs for. I will remove the icon at some point. I was able to change the time on the clock by clicking on it, without connecting to pc.\n\nI will update as she plays.  She is away for weekend and I'm trying to refrain from logging on as guest. I want her experience as the user to come through.\n\nFor registering LPU, Leapfrog has a reward: buy 1 get 1 40% off until 08/31/13.\n\nBy the way,  I don't like Leapfrog's gel skin as it isn't shock proof... see my review.\n\nUPDATE 08/28/23: \"I wish it was as fast as the small Leappad [Leappad 2]\". After two weeks she is complaining about the loading period.  Even with the current firmware, the  Ultra has frozen about 5 times today. Had to wait about 3 minutes when frozen to shut down. And had to try 3 times for it to actually start without sticking. I've added a few new cartridges and apps so these are keeping her entertained despite the wait. Hope it speeds up over time. Taking back a star though."}

The touch screen and stylus are not as sensitive as I would like.  The app store isn't easy to navigate.  Its hard to tell if the one I have is defective or not.  With three small kids I just don't have the time to play with it.  I understand this is only a $150 tablet, but the apps are very expensive.  I expected way more than this."}

Why would you put a product on the market when it is not completely ready.  I understand about finding bugs as you go, but to actually have the message on the web feature \"please be patient this feature is under construction...\"  is so unprofessional -- I am so done!  I called customer service and the rep apologized and just told me that they are still working on fixing this issue.  I asked for an estimated date and the answer was -- soon.  I asked soon meaning next week, next month, Christmas?  All the rep could say is that it will be fixed before Christmas -- really?? We are a LF Family, however I really have to reevaluate and look at other options after this purchase -- $149+ for a product that is not running on all cylinders...shame on you LF!"}

Well, LeapFrog you have done it \nagain!  The LeapPad Ultra has all the wonderful games and apps the original LeapPad \nhad and so much more.  \n \n  Both LeapPads are made for the small hands of the children in my classroom.  They \nboth are built tough enough to handle the bumps and bruises gained in a lively Kindergarten.\n  Yet they have a screen and stylus that mimics the \"grown-ups.\" The\nscreen of the Ultra is bigger and clearer.  The Ultra also has the advantage of \nconnecting with WiFi that I can trust!  My students love using the internet, but I cannot  \nmonitor every child while also teaching.  With LeapPad Ultra's LeapSearch app I can allow\nmy students to view videos and pictures that align with our Common Core Standards without\n  the worry of them accidentally viewing inappropriate content.\n\n\nBut my favorite feature of the games is the \"smart\" technology.  I can monitor the \nprogress my students make by using the Learning Path.  The LeapPad Ultra monitors \nthe progress a student makes and automatically raises or lowers the skill level to be \nappropriate to the child.  Then all of this information is available to parents and teachers \nby connecting the device to the Learning Path. \n \nAs a LeapFrog Ambassador I, and in turn my students,  have benefited from all the \nwonderful materials that have been donated to my classroom.  But of all the learning \nmaterials we have, the LeapPad and LeapPad Ultra are the most sought after (and \nfought over!) items we have...LeapFrog you've outdone yourself again."}

They are incredibly educational and the kids have a blast playing them (they don't even realize that they are learning!).  Last year I was lucky enough to have the 5 original leap pads in my room and the kids never got tired of them the entire school year (which says a lot right there)!\n\nI just received the new Leap Pad Ultra the other day and I am excited for the improvements that it has.  First of all, I love the larger screen and more durable casing. It seems like a more \"kid friendly\" device.  I also like that they installed a 9 hour rechargeable battery because I often had to change the batteries in the original Leap Pad during classroom use.  One of the top improvements, I believe, is that the Leap Pad Ultra has Wi-Fi capability.  Not only that, but it is kid friendly and parents have a lot of control over what kids can see and not see.  I know that the 4-6 year olds in my class will love to be able to search the web for favorite animals, sports, etc.  Leap Frog made it very easy for younger kids to search without getting any inappropriate content.  In addition to all these perks, all the games and book from the other Leap Frog devises are compatible, which makes it nice to not have to re-purchase games that your kids already like.\n\nI am a Leap Frog teacher ambassador and received this product for free to review it and give my honest feed back, which I have whole-heartedly done :)"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "I absolutely love the new LeapPad Ultra. I bought this for my daughter who is 3 (even though the recommended age is 4-9). She navigates it on her own and has absolutely no problem using the stylus. I read a couple reviews that stated that they were having trouble with it reading the stylus, I personally have not experienced that. I also have not experienced the LeapPad freezing or crashing. We have had it for a little over 24 hours and I will update my review if it does but so far we haven't experienced any problems. Also want to mention we have had 2 firmware updates so far. Only negative I have to say about it is it does take a few seconds to load games, shows, music etc. But its not anymore then 10 seconds and I think its ridiculous if your child is that impatient that they would get bored or upset after just 10 seconds of waiting. I already knew that you would have to pay for games, tv shows and music. I loaded it with apps for her as soon as we received it yesterday and if you look online leapfrog always has a coupon code to use. I highly recommend this to other parents. It is more on the expensive side (especially after purchasing apps) but in the long run it is worth it! There are so many educational apps that help them practice numbers, colors and letters. I also knew that the wifi was not a regular browser like on our computer which is one of the main reasons I went with this instead of an Ipad. I did not want her to have the freedom to browse whatever she wanted online (like youtube videos etc). If I want her to use one of the educational websites that is what our computer is for and I can sit with her and monitor it. With the LeapPad I can let her roam the house and not worry about what sites she is getting on. I have always been a huge fan of Leapfrog products and this is yet another hit. My daughter will get so much use out of this. Everywhere we go now I know this will be by her side! Again, I highly recommend this product!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "I am very happy for the opportunity to let you know about the new LeapPad Ultra which LeapFrog sent me for free to review. They asked for me to give my honest opinion and this is something which is really easy for me to do! This past Christmas we bought Josiah a LeapPad - and he LOVES it! I was really impressed with everything the LeapPad could do, but I have to say, LeapFrog has taken the LeapPad to a completely new level with their new LeapPad Ultra!\n\nLeapFrog says, \"Built for children, inside ad out, LeapPad Ultra is the 100% kid-perfect tablet with a 7\" hi-res screen, Wi-Fi and instant access to a best-selling library of 800+ educational games, eBooks, videos, music and more developed or approved by leading educators and designed by game experts. LeapPad Ultra has a sleek, new look and is packed with exciting features:\n\nFront and back camera and video recorder\nMP3 player\nRechargeable battery for up to 9 hours of uninterrupted play\nAC adapter\n8GB for storage and apps\nLeapPad Ultra offers Wi-Fi with a kid-safe web browser which allows children to only access high-quality, age-appropriate content, pre-screened by LeapFrog's learning team.\"\n\nI know when a company writes about their products, they are going to put them in the best light possible, but I can honestly say the LeapPad Ultra lives up to the \"hype\"! There is so much to tell you about . . . more than I want to put in just one post, so I'll let you know about some of the things on LeapPad Ultra I especially like and then finish up my review tomorrow with more of the details about all the new features!\nThere is really much to like about the LeapPad Ultra; I like the larger design, I appreciate the new features such as the MP3 player and I, for one, am really happy to see they added a rechargeable battery and AC adapter! I consider this to be a \"Parent-Grandparent-friendly\" feature!\n\nI am a totally \"non-tech\" person, so I am very happy to see how easy it is to use, how clear the instructions are and how engaging the apps are. Josiah (my grandson) - was thrilled to open the box with the LeapPad Ultras when it arrived and was able to sit right down and start using the programs which LeapFrog loaded for our review. He played a couple games, took photos and made a video (one of his favorite things to do with his regular LeapPad). When I asked him if he liked the LeapPad Ultra, he said, \"I LOVE it!!!\" Apparently it has this almost five year old's seal of approval!\n\nI give the LeapPad Ultra my \"grandma seal of approval\" because it is a great way to help kids learn! Math, reading, geography, science and so much more becomes fun play as kids learn through all the apps, games and eBooks. I'm particularly happy to learn the game cartridges and apps we have already purchased for Josiah's LeapPad will also work with the new LeapPad Ultra! I'm extremely impressed with LeapFrog for making the decision to allow this compatibility between their machines - it seems so often when companies upgrade one of their items you have to purchase all new programs for the new machines. I'm very glad this is not the case with the LeapPad Ultra!\n\nThere is so much more to say about the LeapFrog LeapPad Ultra . . . and I will do so tomorrow . . . along with announcing the details for a give-away of one LeapPad Ultra!\n\nYesterday I wrote about some of the things I like the most about the new LeapFrog LeapPad Ultra today I want to let you know about some of the wonderful new features which help this LeapPad to stand out from all the other options on the market for touch learning pads for children.\n\nOne of the most surprising features on this new LeapPad is the way it allows children to explore the internet with a 100% secure web browser. LeapFrog says, \"Only LeapPad Ultra has LeapSearch powered by Zui. Children can use LeapSearch to browse age-appropriate videos, images and sites from the web which have been reviewed and approved by LeapFrog's Learning Team and in a safe walled-off environment. The Wi-Fi access also allows parents to easily purchase and download content to their child's LeapPad Ultra and offers kid-sae peer-to-peer play across devices using Wi-Fi where two or more LeapPad Ultra tablets connect locally.\"\n\nThis is just cool! Not only is the LeapPad Ultra a learning tablet with a wealth of apps, games and eBooks, but since children can connect to the web with the secure LeapSearch, it opens up a whole new \"world\" of learning possibilities! There are literally dozens of categories for kids to discover, such as sports, arts and crafts, animals and the one my grandson explored on robots! There is nothing else like this which provides a completely secure opportunity for children to explore the web and learn! Very cool!\n\nAnother new and unique to LeapPad Ultra feature is the opportunity for children to play games with other children who have LeapPad Ultras! New games provide the opportunity for two player games and this is so much fun! I played LeapFrog Kart Racing with my grandson - and although I kept running into the walls, mud, trees, mountains, etc, it was a lot of fun! Along with being fun, this game helps children learn and develop their math skills! It is more than just a game for sure!\n\nOne of Josiah's favorite new features is the \"Pet Chat\" feature where he can \"chat\" with someone who has another LeapPad Ultra. Chat is limited to pre-selected words/phrases and emoticons, so it is absolutely secure and safe, but gives kids a fun way to interact with others!\n\nLeapFrog sent me the new LeapPad Ultra for free so I could spend some time reviewing all the new features which make the LeapPad Ultra, \"ultra\" and I have to say in my opinion, the LeapPad Ultra is completely impressive! My grandsons LOVE their LeapPad Ultras and I know along with having a lot of fun with them, they will be learning . . . and discovering how learning can be fun which is a huge benefit!"}

I could not afford the ipad, this looked like it would work just as well for what we wanted and be durable.  But, alas, when you use it to go to PBS kids or any other programmed website, you can only view the videos and printables.  You can not use the educational games that are found on these sites.  I get an error message that my adobe flash is not the most recent.  The product box says that it comes with the most recent flash.  It does not.  It comes with flash 5 not 11.5.  I can not figure out how to update it.  Also, I can not see anyway to add more websites such as time4learning.com or k-12 websites.  Buyer beware.  This is mostly a toy.  If you want an affordable tablet that is similar to the ipad, this is not the product for you.  Unless... the firm ware is updated to allow the aforementioned issues.\n\nOn a good note, my child loves the larger screen.  It helps him with his fine motor skills and problem solving skills.  He loves the device and I will use it as a reward, not as an educational device that I had hoped it was.  I would return it and get a kindle if I could."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "The Leappad2 was released on July 18, 2012. The Leappad Ultra was released on July 17, 2013, not quite a year later.\n\nAs a parent who purchased the Leappad2 last Christmas I was disappointed to find it lasted less than seven months before being pushed to the wayside for a newer model. Already apps available in the Leapfrog App Store are being marked as exclusive for Leappad Ultra, this is frustrating to say the least. The next tablet I purchase for my child will not be a Leappad, it will be a generic tablet or iPad to which I can download child-friendly apps. Competition between App designers will mean I get better apps for a cheaper price (decent Leappad Apps cost from $7.50-$30), and I will buy a new tablet every 3-5 years, instead of Annually as Leappad seems to think is appropriate.\n\nOkay, so some tips from a Leappad parent:\n-Look for games exclusive to Leappad. Some games work on the Leappad or Leapster Explorer, beware these games. They're usually poorly adapted from Explorer, in a lot of examples they use 1/4 or more of the small Leappad screen to replicate the Explorer's A & B buttons for the child to tap. This is a lazy approach to touchscreen technology. Games designed with the leappad in mind do not have this problem. Check out Splurgle, it's our favourite.\n-Be thankful leapfrog is providing you with the MP3 Player and rechargeable batteries. Seriously, high five! I had to purchase both of those things separately. (You may still have to buy the clock App if you want to be able to check the time on your child's device).\n-Download Apps and skip the cartridges. I'm not sure why they even bother with cartridges (so they can charge shipping?), most of the games are also available as Apps and can't be lost.\n-You don't really need headphones, the volume can go down to a nice private volume, but a case is important, these things are a godsend when traveling.\n- Be aware you'll probably have to buy the Leappad Deluxe or some other slightly enhanced model by July 16th, 2014 at which point they'll release new Apps that won't work on your Ultra.\n\nMy apologies if this review came off as a little bitter. Good luck with your purchase decisions!"}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00CS1WDBI", "review": "I do consider myself a technical person as I do work in the mobile and tablets section of Best Buy. The setup of the leappad is extremely easy and when you register your leapfrog account you get to choose between 3 apps for free (we got sugar bugs). I bought the leappad ultra as a birthday gift for my daughter who is turning 4 shortly. I ended up giving it to her early to determine whether or not it is worth keeping and I definitely think it is. We had a nabi 2 previously and she liked it but mostly just watched Netflix on it; my stepson who is turning 10 soon was able to navigate it more smoothly and had a better time with that. I recently just stepped on the screen and broke it which is why I bought the leappad. It is definitely substantial ( a bit heavier than an ipad mini) but my daughter can put it on her lap without any issues. I find that buying the game cartridges instead of apps directly are a better deal because they are cheaper; some are on clearance at best buy and toys r us has 30% off sales which make the games a little less than 20 dollars; also it seems like amazon has really great prices and most retail stores will match them. It is really great that leapfrog does have an app center so that you can download apps straight onto the device if you choose. I don't think it's fair to compare these educational games to free/cheap apps on android or ipad because those aren't regulated; they're either hit or miss with kids. I would compare the leappad ultra to more like a large Nintendo ds with cartridge games and if you put it into that perspective 20 bucks a game is not that bad, considering most ds games are 25-40 dollars. 8 gb of storage is also plenty of space for the downloadable apps; an iphone 4 comes with the same amount of memory.\n\n Sometimes the screen does not respond because my daughter's touch is too light but I'm sure that won't be as much of an issue when her fingers become larger. The stylus definitely does help though  with certain games. She really enjoys reading the ebooks and playing games on it. I don't have to worry about her watching inappropriate videos or accidentally buying apps/games due to the kid safe browser. She does need help with certain activities for games but that is because she is too young too fully understand the concept (ie:estimation in the hello kitty game). Overall, I think the experience is what you make of it and it definitely better to spend time with your child learning and playing with the leappad than to plop them in front of it and expect them to go crazy. I plan on keeping this for a long time to come, it is a well thought out product.\n\nEdit: It is a little annoying that when I actually tried to visit a website on the browser; that the feature was not available yet-you can only search for videos right now. This is very reminiscent of when I first bought my Nintendo 3ds and eshop content was not established yet; except that this disclaimer was on the package. I really hope that Leapfrog gets this connected soon and it would be great for them to offer a free app or credit for sending an unfinished product to market."}

BIG mistake!  If I hadn't already tossed the packaging, the ultra would be going back. I don't usually write reviews, but thought I'd try to help others avoid our mistake.\n\nIt took about an hour to set up before I handed over to my little guy to play (he's 5 1/2)  .  He loved it for the first few minutes until he realized how SUPER SLOW the games are to load.  He managed to keep his patience in check until the games started to freeze or kick him out mid-play . . . REPEATEDLY.\n\nThen, the entire unit froze and wouldn't restart without a power-down/reboot.  After multiple episodes of this in the FIRST DAY, I tried to contact customer support.  The only way to reach them is via email and I haven't heard back yet.\n\nI thought it might be useful to restart, so went to settings to \"repair\" which wiped out our user profile. The repair took a little over an hour & basically reset the device to the factory settings.\n\nNo problem, registered the device again & set-up little guys profile again & he was off and running . . . for about 5 minutes before the whole thing started over again.\n\nThis AM, we turned the device on & the screen showed that it needed to link to leapfrog connect.  I thought maybe there was a firmware upgrade or something to work out some of the glitches, so hooked up to our laptop & launched connect.  WRONG.  It took about 15 minutes for what connect called a \"tune-up\" and now our profile is wiped out again.\n\nBack to setting up/registering the device for the 3rd time . . . in TWO DAYS.  This product will NOT be going on our vacation with us - reverting back to the trusty Leap Pad 1.\n\nHopefully leapfrog will have some updates soon to fix these issues.  Sadly, I think it might be the processor speed.  Should have read the other reviews before we \"jumped in\".\n\nIn short, if you have the Leap Pad 1 or 2, stick with that, they are great products.

They've had them for about 2.5 years and have finally broke, so I bought the younger one a LeapPad Ultra while my daughter moved up to a real tablet. Here's the problems with it:\n\n1. It's much bulkier and heavier than the other LeapPad. My son at 6 years old has a bit of trouble carrying it easily around. I just purchased the case, so we'll see how much even bigger it is with the case on it.\n\n2. The stylus doesn't work half the time, and forget using your finger at all. I think LeapPad knew the stylus didn't work cause they already have it under FAQ. Their suggestion is to wipe the screen to make sure it's dust free and to make sure no other part of the child's hand is brushing the screen anywhere. I guess my son is supposed to hold his arm up in the air the entire time?\n\n3. The slightest touch of the stylus against the screen distorts the picture like an LCD screen.\n\nPositives?\n1.

The pad itself is heavy and cumbersome, and does not come with any protective covering. As the screen is shatter resistant, if it breaks, there is no way to fix it.
