Cybertron is a great company that focuses on the small things that make the difference like free fast customer service strait to a real person that sound to me like he is strait from the company in Wichita not someone working for a company that does customer service for 10 different company. They also have the product key on the computer not hidden in some booklet. I was dumb and did not put the product key in and did not read the directions tell the second day and windows cut out all my fault. I had my computer running within 20 min and was able with the usb 3.0 and chrome and downloading games over internet I had all the stuff I wanted on their within 3 hours. I started windows 8 on a tablet so I loved it on their but I can see why it is not that good on desktop.\n\nFor gaming I play Sims 3, simcity, and flight simulator. I am not a hardcore gamer playing a very heavy game but am a average gamer and for me I don't need ultra shadows or ultra geometry. This computer does not have a super graphic card but the processor make this computer able to play pc game able to play on high settings more than advised by the graphic card not ultra ultra but pretty close. My flight simulator on default good setting goes with no frame drop at all. On simcity I cant play ultra shadows and ultra geometry but I can choose on or the other. In a year or two this may be out of date but in this computer with cybertron being the nice small company they are allow anything to be upgrade and even keep your warranty. For the price as long your not a super harcore gamer this has all the high end features(sata 3, usb 3.0, cool case) for great price! In the long run I don't know. My experince besides my fault with the product key it has been a great seamless experience. It is to bad that amazon is not selling it anymore but you can go to the manufactures website for much cheaper. I like windows 8 with the new apps like people and news but again at the manufactures you can set it to windows 7. The upgrade from my laptop it feels so much faster and usb 3.0 has been such a blessing and I can't see a computer getting much better without unforeseeable prices\n\nThank you cybertron!"}

Ever since the moment I have pulled it out of the box I have been more than impressed.  The case is sturdy, the LED lights inside make it look serious, and it is awesomely fast (compared to my last PC).  I've been playing a slew of games on it.  I can get Skyrim to run really well on the low video settings and I've even been playing Battlefield 4 on low settings and the game play is surprisingly good.  If you want to get a little more serious like I do about gaming, I'd upgrade to a slightly better video card.  With another $100 or so towards a video card, this thing will be able to keep up with the best of them.  I plan on doing that very soon, but I have to admit the video card that it comes with holds its own for the price of this PC!!  My kids play Minecraft on it and it runs flawlessly with all the graphic settings turned as high as they can go.\n\nWe have two screens set up on it right now so we can watch Netflix on one screen while my son plays Minecraft on the other.\n\nMake sure you buy a little wireless USB adaptor if you don't plan on having it close to a wired internet source.  I bought a 300MB/S adaptor for $10 and it works flawlessly.\n\nI actually took the time to add up the cost of each component to see if I could build the same computer for cheaper - and what I found is that it is about $100 cheaper to buy it from CybertronPC.\n\nGood luck and happy gaming!!"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00GFG1B1A", "review": "I ordered this computer for better gaming since I've had a laptop for gaming for about 3 years and it was about time to upgrade. It shipped with ground shipping which was I think 7 to 10 days and it came in about 4, it also came very well boxed and secure which gave me high hopes everything would be in working order when I received it, and I was right. I plugged it in and it started up perfectly except for the side wall fan which wasn't hooked up right but no big deal, took about 2 minutes to get it running. Seeing as how I've been using windows 7 for some time now 8 has been a big adjustment and gave me trouble on a few games I own. The only major problem I've been having is windows 8 apparently uses a lot of internet data usage, seeing as how I can't get high speed DSL where I'm located I have to use my phone to computer connection which does not work well with windows 8. In 5 minutes I used 50Mbs just on the desktop alone without any updates happening and live tiles turned off. Which I knows its not the company's fault. I just live in the middle of nowhere. So don't get windows 8 if you have a usage for your internet. I plan on calling the company sometime soon to see if they can help me with the internet usage problem since I've tried just about anything. I'm currently writing this review on my laptop.\n\nBut anyways the computer is quite fast, I've only had it for 3 days so far and tried out a few games. If your a fan of the Half Life 2 franchise or any source games this computer can max out everything fully with 1080 resolution. It's not even loud when it starts getting going on them. All in all its a great computer to get if your just starting out gaming or want a machine that's up-gradable. Would highly recommend it to friends."}

What I vowed when my HP started acting up was that the next computer I would replace it with would NOT be a Big Name / Big Box computer.\nI wanted what used to be called a clone or generic computer with a good case, strong power supply and separate components that I can update and change when they die etc.\nI searched a lot, read lots of reviews and found a number of computers that fit the bill.\nHOWEVER, after reading reviews for CybertronPCs computers (many that were high dollar rigs) and the raves about their customer service, I found this one, The Borg-Q that fit my budget and had all the features (except I wanted Windows 7 and not the crappy 8 or 8.1 stuff. More on that in a minute) that I wanted.\nSo ordered it here on Amazon. We have Prime so in 2 days (free shipping) this HUGE box arrives at my door. It was packaged SOOO well with huge foam blocks to support it.\nPlugged it in, fired it up (blue lights glowing and all) and it went. No bloat ware really. Couple of useful apps. Just a clean running machine. Im writing this review on it now.\nWindows 8 (this version is the new 8.1 which just means Microsoft tried to fix the major screw-up that Win8 is in my opinion) started up loaded and runs fine for what it is. I had already decided that I would put Win7 on the computer, but when I realized that you have to have the Pro edition of Win7 for it use more than 12GB of RAM (I plan to upgrade this sometime to 32) and the fairly hefty price tag on win7 pro or ultimate, I decided to tweak Win8 and try it out for a while putting the Borg-Q thru its paces. So I cleaned up Win8 after reading stuff online to do. Im knowledgeable but NO expert. Purchased Retro UI for Windows 8.1 (very important that you get the version for 8.1) for $5, loaded it. Ran a registry cleaner and BAM I am happy.\nIn fact after over 3 weeks with Retro UI on the CybertronPC Borg-Q running Windows 8.1 I AM VERY HAPPY.\n\nMost of all I LOVE the craftsmanship and attention to detail that the Borg-Q exhibits. I opened the case to look around and everything is tucked away, zip-tied up and nice and neat. All the component choices are good quality products that I researched individually. Not top-of-the-line, high dollar stuff  BUT GOOD name brand components. The heat sync alone is impressive.\nSo after 3 weeks of loading all my software, applications and using a tweaked version of Win 8.1, I would CERTAINLY buy a Cybertronpc computer again."}

Well built too, the case looks great & he loves the red accents.  No issues with Windows 10 either, it came pre-installed and performs well.  Great thing about Cybertron is there are no extra apps or programs (bloatware).  Only Window stuff which is to be expected.  Also it is so easy to upgrade that a 12 year old can do it! (with my adult guidance of course)  He installed 3 extra fans, an upgraded graphics card & a Wifi/Bluetooth combo card as well.  Very impressed by this computer & a good way to teach a kid about computers because let's face it, computers aren't going away anytime soon & this is what kids are into nowadays.  This is the 2nd Cybertron I've purchased, this 1st one was the family computer & it performs so well that when birthday time came around, this brand was an easy choice.

I purchased this way back in 2015 and figured that, 2 years on, its high time for me to review this puppy. This is my first gaming PC and boy am I happy with this purchase. There's tons of room and, with a little guidance from friends/YouTube, its really easy to customize and upgrade it. Last year, I switched out the now-dated graphic card for a budget GTX 750 Ti and it runs Fallout 4 and Rise of the Tomb Raider pretty well on medium settings (1080p). About a month ago, I started to have overheating problems and it became clear that the heatsink was failing (not to mention getting super noisy). So I replaced the heat sink with an ARCTIC Freezer Xtreme Rev. 2 (if you also do this, please do be sure to read through lots of how-to's and ask a friend with experience for guidance to start, as you will be dealing with the CPU). Now my tower is whisper quiet, even at hour 5 of an intense gaming session. I think I'll be adding an additional 8G RAM and probably upgrading my graphics card again in the near future, and eventually (maybe) the power supply. But the takeaway should be that this set up, while now a little bit dated, have worked really well, and can be upgraded with easy fixes even a beginner can do and, overall, has been cost-effective.\n\nTl;dr Good starter, easily upgraded, good value for recreational gamers who don't need top-tier systems"}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00GFG1B1A", "review": "I've had this computer since Feb 2016 so I can give you all the accurate information you need to make a decision. This is a great first-gaming computer but you must be willing to upgrade it. The mother board is made by Gigabyte, which is decent, but it uses AMD 710 chipset so naturally the Cpu is also AMD. The AMD FX 4130 Cpu is only mediocre at best rating number 10 of the top 10 processors. Amazon will not allow me to post a link to prove this and rejected my first review submission because of it. The AMD FX 4130 inadaquacy causes the frame rate to drop to as low as 10-15 FPS in certain situations in Fallout 4. This cpu probably the weakest point with this computer other than the video card which is a Nvidia GT610 royal piece of garbage! (What's with all the hype from the manufacturer over 48 CUDA cores???)  However, the video card is easier to upgrade than the CPU and this MUST be the first thing you upgrade. I installed an Nvidia GTX 650 (384 CUDA cores) and Fallout 4 ran on Med quality.  Then I bought a Nvidia GTX 960 (1024 CUDA cores) and Fallout 4 now runs on ultra quality but still with some issues. After messing with it for a short time I discovered this. When there's a high demand on graphics, (battle scenes) a 5000 RPM hard drive will freeze for about 5 seconds. A Sata II 7200 RPM hard drive will freeze but for only a few seconds. However, I installed a hybrid SSHD 1 TB hard drive and it almost completely stopped freezing. When it does freeze, it's only for a split second and hardly noticable. So the conclusion is to use a decent graphics card in conjunction with your game installed on a Solid State Hard Drive (SSD). I used Fallout 4 as an example here because it's a very resource-greedy game requiring a lot of horse power! Despite the cpu's inability to keep up, the game still runs rather smoothly otherwise.\nThe next upgrade could be to add a additional 8 gig of RAM. It comes with 8 gig so that would give you 16 gig total. I installed 4-8 gig sticks which give me 32 gig total. A little over-kill but DDR3's are cheaper than DDR4's.\nMy computer came with a 550 watt power supply. I understand some come with only 450 watt. This is a concern since AMD uses more power to function compared to Intel. (Ex. AMD FX 4130 uses 125 watts. Intel I5 6500 uses around 65 watts). So be careful installing extra devices. This computer really should of came with a 650-750 watt power supply since AMD components are being used. But even with the 550 watt limit I have, I'm running a GTX 960 video card, 32 gig of RAM, 3 hard drives, and a total of 5 fans! (Not including the CPU) One of the blades on the CPU fan broke off but with the air flow I have from those other fans, I doubt if it will make a difference. The advantage of all these fans is if one of even two stop running the others will keep things cool until I can fix it. Naturally this many fans makes the computer kinda noisy. This is not an issue for me however.\nThe final conclusion is, even with it's weaknesses, I love this computer! I use it everyday with no problem. I'm giving it only 4 stars because of the hype made by the manufacturer on the GT 610 video card (QUOTE: \"Bring your gaming experience to life with clear, vibrant graphics, thanks to the NVIDIA GeForce GT 610 graphics card\"). GIVE ME A BREAK!!! And the fact it uses AMD components instead of Intel. (But Intel is more expensive). I'm currently building a computer with Intel components that will blow this one out of the water!!! But I'm spending quite a bit more money doing it.\nSo, if you want a gaming computer but don't want to build it from scratch, willing to upgrade it, (very simple installation of video card, RAM, fans, and hard drives) and don't mind a little noise it creates, this is the one for you!!!\nUPDATE: At the time and for the price I was content with this purchase. However, this computer has currently (Feb 1, 2018) been \"freezing\" then displays blue screen with dpc_watchdog violation. The 550 watt power supply has been replaced with an 850 watt, I replaced the OS windows 8.1 with a new one (on a new hard drive), the video card has also been replaced, and naturally all the drivers are current. The obvious conclusion is a defective motherboard. Electronics can fail at any time but to have a motherboard last for only two years is unacceptable. As stated above, this uses an AMD cpu which is cheap and I will not purchase another Gigabyte board because of this ones early death. I did build an Intel I5 and am now building another. No more AMD products in my rigs! Your experience my be different but if you decide to buy this computer don't expect it to last long..."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00GFG1B1A", "review": "If you are looking to buy a gaming pc, don't buy a prebuilt. This is overpriced and can't play games at all. The video card they put into this computer is notorious for being a garbage low end card that can't do any gaming aside from old games from before 2005. Anything past that era and you'll see issues with framerate and will have to lower the settings so far down that it ends up looking unplayable. Games like battlefield 4 at low settings and at 1024x768 can't even make it to 20 fps, even csgo, a 4 year old game built on an engine that is over 12 years old has issues on this computer and isn't able to be played at anything above low settings at 1366x768 with the gt 610. I had to upgrade the video card after 9 months (a geforce gtx 960) but then I started noticing that the cpu was also garbage. Even though the fx 4130 is advertised as a quad core processor, it's more like a pentium or an core i3, but even then it can't match an i3. The fx 4130 (paired with the gtx 960) had troubles with gta 5 which makes sense because it came out 3 years after the 4130, but even in older games, the fx 4130 had issues. In older bethesda rpgs like fallout 3/new vegas and skyrim, the fx 4130 could never keep a consistent framerate and kept going below 40 fps when it was paired with a gtx 960. Again, even csgo was very unpredictable with the fx 4130 with the gtx 960 as sometimes it would run at above 80 fps all the time, but then at others times it would stay at 30 fps throughout the entire game. Overall, if this were priced at somewhere around $300 and wasn't called a gaming pc, I would be ok with recommending this computer, but because this is called a gaming computer, there is now way that I'm going to recommend this computer at $500."}

I didn't find this out until I opened the side panel to connect a graphics card I wanted to transfer from my older system to this new system) as well as reading through the questions regarding upgrading the graphics card, after my visual discovery, thinking maybe I'm just not seeing it.\n\nIf I had know CybertronPC would upgrade my PSU for free to one that would include this relatively crucial element, I would have had that done. Not too big a deal - I will order a new graphics card that doesn't require the additional power source and eliminate the problem altogether - although, that also puts limitations on the speed and power of any graphics card I purchase. Maybe, at some point in the future, I will upgrade my PSU...I'm just not willing to go through the frustration and hassle right now.

I'm sorry to say that has changed.\nOK, for the price point this is not a bad PC.  It has nice aesthetics and tons of USB ports, plus a decent processor and MB.  The graphics card is bottom end, but you can upgrade that fairly easily, and it has a 550w Power Supply, which is decent.\nI had very high hopes for this box, and it's supposed full year warranty, however, customer service is sorely lacking.\nThe technicians mean well and are friendly, however once I started having problems with the machine I got the run-around treatment for months before I finally insisted they take it in for service.\nOnce I shipped it to them (at my expense) it was 2 weeks before I got any answers and return shipping.  2 days after having it back, it failed again for the same issues.  They wanted me to send it back again.  I refused and asked for an exchange.  I was told that since the warranty was \"almost over\" (purchased in February, issues from June on, 4 months is not a year) they didn't want to do an exchange.  From June to December we had been fighting with this tower and I just wanted a new one.\nWell, their own policy is to not release a new machine till the old one is enroute back to them.  So on a Monday morning I sent my tower back and emailed them the receipt from UPS as proof.  3 more days of follow up emails and no answer, so by Thursday I call and ask what's going on?  They haven't even built one for me yet.....\nSeriously folks.  For an inexpensive, low end gaming PC, you could at least treat the customers better.  If you want a basic tower you are going to customize yourself anyhow, buy a barebones kit from Tiger Direct...."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00GFG1B1A", "review": "I purchased this product custom built directly from the cybertronpc website, adding a few extra things and taking out a few things.  Now that I have reached past the one year mark with this computer I can successfully say that this computer is an excellent base build to work with.  Note that if you are an avid user who likes to push the limits of technology I strongly suggest you be more than willing to commit to this computer as a project rather than an end-game product.\n\nThe good:\n\n-Excellent customer service over the phone!\n-Fast boot times\n-Runs cool when the ambient temperature isn't over 80 degrees Fahrenheit\n-Large storage capacity\n-LOTS of room to upgrade\n-(Custom) The Gigabyte Wifi Card works amazingly well, on a crowded network I am capable of managing 20mb/s when I unleash my speeds\n-The MSI overclocking controls allow for added safety parameters for heat\n-Plenty of usb ports to work with (I managed to fill most of them)\n-The audio controls\n\nCons\n\n-The hard drive is a disk drive, thus being the slowing factor of the computer (I should have gone with the smaller solid state drive)\n-The starting ram will need to be upgraded\n-The heatsink isn't capable of handling ambient temperatures beyond 80 degrees Fahrenheit\n-Naturally this computer will warm your room up when it is running\n-I didn't become a millionaire\n\nIn general I would absolutely recommend this computer to anyone who is in the market for a good rig to build off of.  Although I would direct them straight to the cybertron website since there they have the capability to customize their computers the way they want and need.  It has been a good year with my baby(computer), and I see plenty of good ones on the way as I proceed with upgrades to improve performance.\n\nTips:\n\n-I would absolutely look into buying an aftermarket heatsink for this rig if you live in an area that gets warm or you don't have adequate air conditioning in the room.\n-I would run with the smaller but faster solid state hard drive rather than the sluggish disk drives\n-I would seriously think about setting up the computer with a RAID array with multiple drives for added speed since RAM isn't as big of an issue."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00GFG1B1A", "review": "This computer is great for it's value. For a relatively casual gamer like myself it is a great computer for a great price. Eventually I will be purchasing a GTX 950 or a 750ti to upgrade the graphics card, but for the price you pay the GTX 610 is a pretty good card. You can play some less demanding games on low to medium graphics settings pretty easily and the Nvidia Game Optimizer gives you a great tool to optimize all of your games for your graphics card and monitor. If you are the kind of person that really prefers to play on higher graphics settings, then I would consider looking at another computer or purchasing a separate, more powerful graphics card.\n\nAnother great thing about this computer is it's accessibility for customization. It is very easy to install new parts or replacement parts which means this is a computer that can last as long as you want it to. Feel like your computer is starting to slow down a little bit? Replace or upgrade the processor as a cheap alternative to buying a whole new computer. Had the computer for a while and want to play games on higher graphics? Spend a few hundred bucks on a graphics card.\n\nThis will be directed towards a very small crowd, but this computer is also great for graphic designers. I am a professional graphic designer and needed a decent home computer for the few times that I need to work from home. Macbooks are pretty much the go-to for graphic designers, but this is a powerful and affordable alternative. I can run Illustrator, Photoshop and InDesign all at the same time with no decrease in performance at all. I would highly suggest this to graphic designers who are looking for a cheap alternative and for those rare designers who prefer to work on Windows.\n\nWhat to buy separately: The keyboard and mouse included are good and definitely serve their purpose, but if you are looking for a gaming mouse/keyboard, you will need to buy that separately. Also, this computer does not have an integrated wifi receiver, plan on purchasing a wifi adapter for online gaming. If you are a student who wants to both game and do homework on this computer, plan on purchasing Microsoft Office separately (some schools offer Office for free).\n\nConsidering these things, this computer is for you IF:\n-You are wanting to get into PC gaming but can't afford a top end computer.\n-You enjoy PC gaming but don't yet have a decent gaming computer.\n-You are looking for a computer that you can customize and keep up to date with new hardware.\n\nThis computer is NOT for you IF:\n-You already have a decent gaming PC and are looking to upgrade.\n-You are looking for a top end gaming PC to play almost every game on high settings."}

When it finally died I starting looking for something that would best fit my needs. All I needed was something to get online, watch videos, movies, music, light gaming, etc. Just the basic stuff but reasonably priced. I also wanted something non proprietary just in case I decided to upgrade and do more with it. This fit the bill nicely. It's extremely quiet and starts up quickly. I had a small issue when I first got it, a wire connector came loose during shipping, not at all Cybertron's fault. I opened the case to check it out. In there I saw a very professional looking build. There's plenty of room in the case to add on if need be. Every wire was tied in place and all the connections were tight and not stressed, except for the one that popped during shipping but snapped it back together and everything was perfect. The lights are cool as hell and it definitely looks awesome. A lot better looking than the name brands put out. My monitor died recently and I had no clue how much the graphics card could handle but I upgraded to a 32 inch screen and haven't had one glitch yet. I don't consider myself computer savvy but I do have common sense and this rig was the perfect match for me. I've been recommending them to friends who have been in the similar situation and they were sold. I know my next pc will be coming from Cybertron as long as they're still around."}

Now I have replaced many parts but the motherboard finally said I am thru.\nSo I was going to get a named brand desktop to replace my now defunct one. After looking for days i decided to give Cybertron a try after\nlooking at the reviews and spec I was looking for. I am not a gamer but this computer fit the bill. I also took a chance because of some\nof the reviews of people have issue right out of hte box. But saw Cybertron seem to respond with good quick customer service. I have now\nbeen using this for several month's and I am extremely happy with this computer. Is it badass well no but it is fast and works very well. And while\nmy other computers do not run some old games and will not even allow me to load them this unit with same operating system allow them to load and they work fine. My daughter 16 wanted me help her build a computer a step or 2 above this one but after seeing mine and us figuring out the cost to build one the Cybertron come out over 150 dollars cheaper. So if I can afford it I will most likely be buying a better version of this unit.\nI have had not issues with this computer and I am an Intel guy but this AMD computer and this brand have exceeded all my expectations. And\nI believe if I ever have an issue and have to contact the manufacture I would bet they would have a speedy response and resolution. 2 thumbs up :)\nUpdate: I found that this computer has a minor flaw. It seem much slower than both my HP and Lenovo laptop and it freezes up a lot. Also, only when I use Mozilla to surf it locks up quite a bit and have to wait till it unfreezes. Wondering if it is the AMD processor I took a chance on NOT using Intel which has always worked flawlessly. It's video card will have to also be upgraded in the near future. After owing this for a while now I thinking of getting my daughter a name brand computer for Christmas and with an Intel chip.\nStill for the price it work fine so still 5 stars"}

Having said that it is no where near perfect for a high end gamer or graphic designer. I will list the pros and cons in a simple manor below discussing my experience of the product.\n\nPROS\n  The packaging seemed to keep the computer intact  ( on arrival there was no damage)\n  The PC has a decent motherboard and CPU ( Computer Processing Unit)\n  The PC stays relatively cool while I am surfing the web or gaming on it\n  Easy set up with the instructions that it came with\n  CD drive works fairly well\n  There are many USB ports including a 3.0 and 2.0 USB (just make sure you are aware of what USB devices you are connecting. A USB 3.0 device works better on a 3.0 port and a USB 2.0 device works better on a 2.0 port)\n  There are a lot of options for fan installation (You can put them on the top, side, and in the back of the computer)\n  Easy power button access\n  The Tower Design is more of a futuristic look\n  The one Terabyte heart drive is more than enough to store your home movies or personal files on\n  Comes with 8GBS of RAM (Random Access Memory) which meets the requirements of most modern games\nCONS\n  The GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) is only a 1 GB graphics card. (Meaning it cannot handle high end gaming, it will handle Skyrim on low graphics settings. Hopefully that gives you and idea of what it can and cannot handle)\n  The PC comes with a 450 Watt power supply which needs to be upgraded before you upgrade other components ( I would recommend spending a little extra money to get a 1000 Watt power supply if you plan on upgrading in the future)\n  The motherboard does not have WIFI capability  (buying an inexpensive external network adapter works)\n  It is relatively quiet but the LED lit fan can still be audibly heard a few feet away.\n  The LED lights are not good for people who suffer from Migraines (such as myself) or seizures because LED lights can trigger migraines and seizures to occur for long periods of use\n   In the package there are a bunch of papers and extra stuff\n  The CPU will be just fine for most people but may need to be upgraded if you intend to upgrade the computer for more demanding programs\n\nConclusion;\nThis PC is good at low end gaming and personal use. It surfs the web relatively fast and there is virtually little to no loading times when opening up a program. The storage space makes for worry free large downloads. Someone can easily connect USB devices to the PC.  It is an easy PC to use if you have a small to intermediate knowledge about computers."}

I had not heard of this particular company before so I did my usual research.  I ordered the system and got it right after the 4th of July.  Unfortunately, upon beginning the setup process I found that the hard drive was faulty and would not get past a certain point of the setup up process for Windows.  I contacted CybtertronPC's customer support and I was able to get everything straightened out and fixed in no time.  I've not had such a pleasant experience with anyone's Customer Support the way I did with CybertronPC!\n\nNow that I've had it for a while and I have been using it all I can say is \"WOW!\"  This system is by far completely worth its price.  The only hard ware change I have done so far is swapping out the graphics card for a newer, better option.  I love the fact that the motherboard has expandable RAM up to 32gigs.

I was not surprised to see other bad reviews for this computer and so I was compelled to write my own. Quite honestly I figured it was all my sorry luck and I just got the lemon of the bunch but No.  First off the computer arrived in a Blue color and I thought ok so they made a mistake on the color of the item since I wanted red, no big deal so long as it works.  Soon after i set it up I found the CD video player did not open, it remains closed shut to this day, and it didn't help that the manual was on a CD.  Ok I thought I'll find other options to play discs on this (like an external player)  So then after about say a month or two later the BSODs~blue screens of death~started to come in droves and i do mean one right after the other after the other....Now this aggravated me badly since the price for this machine was expensive at least to me and I only brought this cause I had upgraded my system to the fastest internet possible.  I kept booting it up and tried downloading software to clear these issues...after about a few weeks later peace finally settled in, but that was the quiet before the storm...and I'm talking Hurricane force....There was constant shut downs and automatic repairs and BSODs and what not....It was bad, very very bad.  And then I thought this shouldn't be the problem of a brand new top of the line desktop.  So then I set it aside and forgot about the whole deal and brought out my old 2007 desktop and it worked fine but slow...But after a week or so I thought oh well lets try the Cybertron PC  Borg Q~again.  So I set it up and it was working good again~a miracle i thought....But low and behold a few days later July 11, 2016 a monday morning It just up and shut down for good.  I kept booting it up and time and again it was just shut down after shut down. And that did it for me....Now I notice that these bad reviews are often answered by customer service in the comments section of the amazon review..  Prompting buyers to call a number etc and writing something like ..\"Sorry for your problems with our item\" or some such crap.....But I'm tired and lament having lost about $500 on this desktop....I will have to buy another soon...cause my 2007 desktop is out of date and so slow even with the fast speed internet, As a matter of fact,  I'm typing this on the 2007....But the Cybertron should have been the one that brought me in to the 2015~16s and beyond....I'm angry tired and needed to vent~so there....."}

The PC is lauded as 'upgradeable' and that's exactly what I did, though it was shortly going on a year that the problems started.\n\nThe first problem right out of the box was that this computer would not enter sleep mode and when I forced it to, the CPU and RAM usage would go through the absolute roof and when shut down manually, the computer refused to boot unless the RAM was reseated. I don't know what caused this. I have reason to think the motherboard they shipped this thing with, was faulty.\n\nBut that's not the only problem it shipped with. Barring any additions, the CPU it shipped with had heat issues in less than a year, less than five months. The thermal paste was a smouldered black mess, and it had to be reapplied.\n\nSecondly, it's 'upgradeability'. I had no problems upgrading the GPU, but the CPU? This board is too faulty for anything above a 4000 something amd processor. I upgraded the processor to a 8350 for futureproofing. And it burned out in over a year, burning through the thermal paste and fusing to the heat sink in the process. I'm suprised I didn't damage the motherboard when I got it out.\n\nNow at the time of writing/editing, the computer has begun to restart in the middle of use. I can be playing a game, watching youtube, and the computer will automatically restart. This is not a power supply issue as I have checked in event viewer, but it's still a sign that, after a year of use, this computer is not well.\n\nIt shipped with bad, low quality parts. And that's this PC in a nutshell. Overpaying for parts that will go bad in a matter of years. Dont buy it. If you no longer have the patience for building your own PC, there's a ASUS desktop for slightly cheaper that is on the level of this PC's performance for almost 400, or a ASUS PC that beats the crap out of this one for around 6-7 hundred. You can do better. You can do better than this shoddy piece of crap with really bad parts."}

I was very excited and please, the  look is great, the performance was great also, I had no issues whatsoever. I upgraded the video card to an EVGA GeForce GTX 750Ti SC 2GB so the machine was running great.  About a month ago out of the blue I started to get some kind of stutter on the sound and I have been able to get rid of it. I am not sure if it is something to do with drivers, but when I try to update I am told I have the latest sound and video driver. I don't know what to do and I can't get ahold of the Cybertron PC tech support. That is the only reason I gave 3 stars instead of five. would have been great if it worked flawlessly."}

Couldn't keep it on for 30 min without a crash. Even though I returned this a while back, it's still irritating to think about. Customer service said that they could send me CDs to reformat and do a clean install, or send it to them. IIRC it was a conflict with hardware. Whatever it was, I paid for a working machine and didn't get one. I ended up spending almost twice as much on an HP (which is also much faster) and don't regret it one bit, because it still runs flawlessly. It may be due to the fact that it's running on Win 7 Pro 64.\n\nIf you happen to get a lemon like I did, at least returns are easy."}

I opened it and moved it to my desk and I hear loose screws inside the machine. Not a big deal, i'll go ahead and keep using it. Started up, began to configure windows, and then the computer shuts off and dies on me. I thought it was an isolated event, but behold it would not stay on for more than 2-3 minutes. I called their support desk, and they weren't able to help, but offered a replacement. This would take another 3 days. I don't know about for you, but for me time is money thats why we adore amazon because our products get to us so fast.  I opened up the computer, and found that the motherboard was screwed in incorrectly in two locations! The fans were not plugged correctly. Now, I understand you claim to test your products before you ship them out, but there is no way that shipping caused this mishap. I question their quality control. Time is money to me, and having to wait on hold, deal with these issues, fix them myself took several hours out of my day.\n\nIn sum, if you're looking for a product that may have issues, steer clear.

It seems some people are saying theirs works excellent; however, that is not my experience nor my boyfriends. Mine struggles with speed on basic web browsing or multiple tabs and my boyfriends is a nightmare it freezes all the time and restarts on its own. One of the main issues is that somehow the CPU % usage gets extremely high on it's own and fluctuates like crazy. It's been a bit better since the Windows 10 update. Honestly I don't game, I use this computer for school and it's performance is't even acceptable for that let alone gaming. Are there fixes for this, or did we both somehow end up with defective units? By the way I've owned this unit for almost 2 years, when I bought it I really needed a computer for school work since my laptop went down and just ended up keeping it. Unless there are easy fixes for the issues, there's no way I would recommend this product to anyone.\n\nI would like to add that my bf switched out his CPU to the AMD 8350 a couple days ago (today is 5/5/17), new fan, graphics card and it's working much better. I just ordered the AMD 8370 with fan and I'm very excited that my computer will be working well.  I will let you know how it goes. I may switch other parts later."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00GFG1B1A", "review": "I'm very grateful for the affordability of this gaming machine, but if this is your first gaming rig, there are some things you should probably know. I wanted to post a follow up review around a year later. I've had the machine about a year-and-a-half now.\n\nI noticed the machine was struggling with the relatively recent Cities Skylines. It was once playing Skyrim on the highest settings with extreme fluidity. I'm not quite sure what happened as everything seemed to be in working order and I did everything I could that would typically fix performance issues, but after about a year the machine really began having some issues in terms of running games. I didn't fault the machine - I knew it was inexpensive and I figured it was time to start upgrading. That was the whole point of buying this machine. I could upgrade it.\n\nAs I started upgrading, I consulted PC Gamer magazine for parts ideas. In the back they usually have a current \"budget build\", \"mid-range build\", and the \"high-end\" build. This machine was so far removed from the \"budget build\" that I was pretty shocked. Anyone with a general knowledge of PC maintenance and repair could have built the same rig for half the cost. Granted, that's without the keyboard and mouse, but if you want to game I would suggest getting a different keyboard and mouse anyways. It was nice of Cybertron to include them, but they're pretty much back-up/spare parts quality. The kind of keyboard and mouse you'd use for \"facebook, email, and online shopping.\" They went immediately to the parts tote in my basement. Some of the internal parts were a few years out of date, even in regards to the year I purchased it. They were extremely low-budget parts even then. I'm not sure if they made any changes to the product, the meat and potatoes seems to be the same, but I checked my RAM with Speccy and it was 800 Mhz, not 1600. The power supply was only 450 watts. It's seriously the first thing I would suggest upgrading if you plan to use this machine as a starting point (something other reviewers have pointed out).\n\nOn the plus-side, it was a great starting point for an upgrade-able gaming rig. I was able to learn a lot through researching the parts and researching replacement parts. It performed about where I expected in regards to its price, but as I said, I was shocked by how cheap all the parts actually were. When I decided to upgrade, I pretty much had to upgrade everything - and I went for somewhere between a current budget machine and a mid-range machine. I kept only the DVD drive since I rarely used it anyway, and I kept the cooler and HDD, but I plan on upgrading those as soon as I can. That being said, knowing what this cheap little guy could handle, I knew my low-mid machine was going to be more than suitable for my needs.\n\nIf you're looking for a cheap machine to upgrade and learn with, this is fantastic. If you're hoping to get a nice gaming PC and don't know much about the hardware and software, you're going to want to spend quite a bit more cash on something beefier and more current.\n\nAnother plus was the lack of bloatware and unnecessary extras. I'm very comfortable just cloning the HDD to my next drive when I get to that junction.\n\nI hope this review was helpful!"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00GFG1B1A", "review": "Update August 3, 2017\nI purchased this computer March of 2016. I finally decided to do some upgrades. I doubled the memory and ordered the 750ti graphics card for it.\n\nOops.... The graphics card does not fit. The power cord and other cords are in the way, plus it it covers the slot where my WiFi card goes.\n\nThere are people talking about how well this computer runs with the 750ti board. They must have a different mother board is all that I can think of.\n\nHere are couple of photos. One is shows my normal 610 board and my WiFi card. the other hats the 750ti just laying in the case. You7 can see the difference.\n\n(Don't look at the dust too hard. My computer sits on a small wood platform on the floor.)\n\nOn the plus side, the extra memory is causing my computer fly....\nI run Linux Mint as an operating system.\n\nOriginal review below:\n**********************************\nI just now set this computer up. It was very easy to setup, including adding my RAID tower with 10 TB of storage. In fact, it was automatic.\nThe Logitech keyboard and mouse is the wired variety so there is no setup for them.\nThere are 2 groups of plugs for a monitor to be plugged into, but there is a sticker pointing to the proper group of connections.\nIt does come with a Windows CD and Cybertron CD.\nThe case is actually slightly larger then I was expecting.\n\nHowever, I am feeling foolish since I have WiFi at home and there is no WiFi card in this computer. It is setup for cable only. I will have to order a WiFi card. A point that I missed when ordering it.\n\nIt is also missing a memory card reader, although I was aware of that before ordering it. I have built-in card readers in my printers.\n\nI took 1 star off for the missing WiFi, which has become a standard in every home and business.\n\nUpdate March 17, 2016 (One day later)\nI am not sure if it the design of the manufacture's setup or just the way that Windows 8.1 acts, but I am liking this computer less and less. I have never used Win 8.1 or Win 10. And judging by all of the info about the spyware on Win-10, I don't think that I want it either. But I do know that Linux Mint acts a lot like Win-7, which I like.\nWhile I am waiting for a WiFi adapter to show up, I figured that I would install Linux Mint 64. The problem is that I can not get into the BIOS setup. The setup directions are misinformation. The instructions say to hit the delete key at a prompt instead of the F2 or F8 keys, which is more normal. (And something that I have also tried.) The problem is that the prompt never appears. By using a high-speed camera, I was able to see a prompt for using the CRTL-A key to get at the BIOS.  But that doesn't seem to work either.\n\nSo my initial impression is that I don't like this computer. At this point, I am giving it 3 stars. This may improve after I can connect it to the Internet with a new WiFi card. But right now, it is a pain....\n\nUpdate March 18, 2016\n\nOK, my bad. Upgrading this to 4 stars again. When I burned a CD of Linux Mint using a different computer, it turned out that the software that I used didn't burn the DVD properly, so I had a bad disk. After re-burning a DVD using different software, this computer booted it and ran Linux Mint perfectly.\n\nStill waiting for the WiFi card to arrive. It should arrive today.\n\nUpdate March 19, 2016\n\nI put an ASUS WiFi card into this computer today. The computer case was easy to open and there was only one obvious place to connect the card. No problems installing the new card. I am currently on Amazon with this computer now.\n\nMuch of the software had to be updated after I was finally able to connect to the Internet with this computer. I think that Windows was updating drivers and software for about 2 hours, without downloading Windows 10.\nThe hardware drivers also had to be updated.\n\nI have noticed a boot issues, which I had assumed the updates would help with, but didn't:\n  *The computer is slow to boot, relative to it's normal speed.\n  *The computer has not allowed me access yet to the Bios. Hitting F11 during startup on this computer is supposed to allow it. It has not so far.\n  * The computer won't boot when my RAID tower is connected and turned on. I have to turn it off in order to boot the computer. I have no idea why, but this means that I won't be able to use one of the drives in my RAID Tower for 'Windows Backup'.\n\nNow that I have access to the Internet, I installed the software for my printers, which has built-in card readers. They work perfectly with this computer.\n\nThe computer came with a wired Logitech keyboard and wired mouse, which I believe is needed with a new computer. But I wa glad when I replaced them with wireless versions.\n\nI didn't find any Bloatware.\nThe only security software which comes with this computer is the Microsoft Security Essentials package. I considered this good news.\nNo MS Office software. I installed LibreOffice, which is free.\nI didn't notice any games with this computer either, although the updates did mentions some.\nBut my reason buying this computer had noting to do with games. I needed a better graphics computer and this one seems to fill the bill.\n\nUpdate March 21, 2016\n\nI've had this computer 5 days now and I running into issues with it. The current issues comes with software supplied with this computer for recognizing connected hardware devices. It's called Displaylink and it is evidently supposed to automatically identify and download the proper drivers for you hardware. A function that I thought was supposed to part of the Windows operating system. Anyway, after it updated my RAID tower was not accessible to this computer. I have verified that my RAID tower is working perfectly. Just not with this computer.\n\nThis same software did not recognize  my newest Epson printer and disabled the some of the drivers for it. However, by re-installing the Epson software, Dispalylink has been working fine with it. (I have 2 Epson printers connected to this computer.)\n.\nAlso there is another problem, this just be a problem with Windows 8.1, but the computer clock does not connect to online clocks to show an accurate time and date. I just noticed that the computer clock was off by 36 hours (1 day and a half.)\n\nThis is the 1st time that I have used Windows 8.1, and have decided to let it proceed to update to Windows 10. This has been my 1st experience with Windows 8 or 8.1 and I hate it.\n\nI ran Linux Mint from a CD which worked fine.  Then I installed a new ASUS WiFi card which does not seem to be comparable with Linux on this computer. So I have not install Linux on the hard drive yet.\n\nUpdate March 22, 2016\n\nI installed Linux on this computer and feel much more positive about about this computer. This was the first time that I had run Windows 8x or newer, and find it to be a pure pain.\nIt turns out that something within Windows 8.1 was blocking access to my RAID hard drive tower. (Don't know what, and don't care at this point.)\n\nI also found out that my ASUS WiFi card can be made compatible with Linux and runs fine on this computer.\n\n(Anyone wanting to know how I made the ASUS card compatible with Linux, read my review of the card:\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/ASUS-Wi-Fi-PCI-Express-Adapter-PCE-AC56/dp/B00JNA337K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">ASUS Wi-Fi PCI Express Adapter (PCE-AC56)</a>)\n\nFinal thoughts:\n\nPros:\nThis computer seems to be a good computer to meet or exceed most people's needs.\nRunning Linux on this computer resolved all of my hardware problems.\n\nCons:\nNo WiFi adapter with computer\nNo card reader with computer\nIt is supplied with Windows 8.1 or 10. (A big let-down for me.)\nWhile booting is slow under either Windows 8.1 or Linux, getting at the BIOS on this computer seems to be impossible for unknown reasons. At least for me."}

I love the red glow and the amount of fans that it has! My last computer's motherboard fried, pretty sure it was due to not enough fans and good ventilation. The computer runs very smoothly. It was a very smooth set up too. I love how FAST this computer is compared to my old pc that was a Dell. As for gaming, ALL the games I play run REALLY great too! I play so many different games online and I will be trying the newest Final Fantasy in the next week or 2 with this computer and I am confident it can handle it too."}

I was very disappointed to see that this company had made a poor first impression. Now, having just gotten off the phone less  than an hour ago, I got a cord and a USB network adapter free of charge *expedited over night!*. I just received my invoice that it shipped and am happy to say that Cybertron has certainly rectified themselves in my eyes. Upon delivery of my products, I might edit this post.\n\nNow on to the good stuff :)\n\nI was not originally looking at buying this computer. I was looking for a cheap,decent quality desktop that I could upgrade for the next few years. I was not expecting much. Having just gotten it today, I am blown away by the speed and versatility! The LED Fans are amazing and I can add up to 4 more easily! The included MSI After Burner software is fantastic and has a wonderful user interface. Although cheap, the GPU is fantastic for beginner to medium gaming/graphics. With an upgrade from 8 to 16 gb RAM and a 2gb GPU, this is going to be a beast! Overall I am very satisfied with it!\n\nOne of the only cons I can see right now is just the sheer bulk of the tower. It is massive! Accessibility is a little tricky too, the two screws on the back to remove the side are semi difficult to put back in as well. More effort than needs to be exerted. I have attached a picture of it in action :)"}

I also attempted to play Skyrim but the performance was so poor that I gave up. Right out of the box any new AAA games are out of the question. The problem is the video card in this computer is trash. Luckily it is easily replaced. Once I put a GTX 760 OC it runs great. I can play Fallout 4 with no problems. Another snag I ran into with this computer is that the motherboard is very small, I had a WiFi card installed but I had to remove it to make room for the new video card.\n\nAll in all, I would say build your own computer instead of buying this one. That being said, if you want to go prebuilt this is an OK machine to start with."}

Most old games worked ok when set on low resolution. After being warned that goggle would not update Vista Operating systems I decided it was time again to upgrade my system. My chooses were to go to win 7 or buy an entire new system. After an exhaustive search Cybertron kept coming up as the best buy for the buck. I finally decided on the CybertronPC Borg-Q. This system was for the most part rated quite high for the price and had ample room for expansion. The system was delivered on time. As with all \"new out of the box\" systems I was prepared for some bumps in the road but the system fired up first try (very fast). I did have a problem with the wireless card and contacted Cybertron tech assistance immediately. After about a 2 minute wait a tech picked up. She spent approximately one hour on the phone to assess the problem only to find it probably was a faulty wireless card. She than gave me the option to receive a replacement card or a usb (faster connection) wireless connection. I opted for the USB.\nI have since been in contact with Cybertron regarding hooking up a second monitor. They walked me through the connection and set up of this device as well.\nLong story short, the Cybertron system preforms better than expected and the support is unsurpassed. I highly recommend this or any system by Cybertron.\n\nRalph Capelli"}

This computer really plays the games I want to play extremely well, none of my games are FPS lameness so higher end requirements do not worry me too much ( I think most of the reviewers who say its not quite up to their games are playing very new graphics pigs shooters which thrill me not at all, anyone can shoot a target in those FPS and until a FPS can model fatigue, fear, and the truly random, chaotic, uncertain, and horrific nature of modern infantry combat and  CQB they might as well just be target practice). It boots fast, loads fast and stays cool and is pretty quiet. The case is kind of large and there is plenty of expansion and upgrade ability built into it. I find the graphics to be superb and the processor has had no problems with any of the games I have tried old, or newer. I have no complaints except Win 8.1 seems like a dumbed down non intuitive OS for novice users ( not the computers fault and correctible) and that it is so large it does not fit under my desk too well. RIght now I cant wait to get home from work and play some Pillars of Eternity, Divinity Original Sin, or Torchlight 2. It would run Diablo 3 or StarCraft (and lots of others) but who wants to bother with Blizzard. UGH life is too short for that aggravation."}

When I unboxed the PC there was a loose screw that was rattling around inside the cabinet.  That can be fatal to a PC if it becomes lodged between the motherboard and the case - it might short out the motherboard or other component.  Not a big deal but it did make me wonder about build quality and testing/checking prior to shipping.  I opened up the case (no screwdriver required, nice big thumbscrews made it easy) and I had the screw out in about a minute. Buttoned it back up and connected everything.\n\nWhen I powered it up I wasn't able to boot.  Windows boot logo appears, runs for 30 seconds or so and then the error message shown in the photo appeared.  I figured that I could re-install the OS.  Nicely, this PC comes with a real Windows 8.1 DVD instead of having to download or create your own backup copy.  I called technical support and after about a 15 minute wait, I spoke with a nice technician who walked me through the process of booting from the DVD copy.  He was moderately knowledgable, friendly and very patient.  We repartitioned the drive to prepare for the re-install.  One thing.. the repartition lost 70GB of storage and the technician didn't think that was a problem (kind of \"oh well- that happens\").\n\nAfter working with him for 25 minutes or so and trying to do a clean OS install twice we were unable to correct the problem. The re-install failed both times with a blue screen that indicated an NTFS file system problem.  The tech offered to replace the system at no charge or cross ship provided I provided a credit card up front that would be refunded when DOA machine was received.  That's a fair offer of course but I decided to return the machine for a refund."}

The computer runs decently fast, and it's parts are able to handle nearly most games around 60 - 20 FPS. I have played DayZ, League, WoW, and CS:GO on this. With some other games that didn't require much, so they got 60 fps. Other than that this rig, even on the lowest settings the game can go, still was barely able to keep any game, other than League, above 30 FPS. I did expect this though from the rig, since the graphics card isn't that great. My BIG complaint is the fact this sucker is super loud with it's fans. Even at idle with headphones on, you can hear it. I have a nice mic that doesn't pick it up, but i'm worried to upgrade to a better one that'll pic that up. All in all it's a amazing starter pc, with tons of room for upgrade.

Shipped prime, so go it in two or three days. The Graphics card must of slipped out during shipping and was just on the bottom of the case freely sliding back and forth with no wrapping. I slid it back in and tried to boot, and windows would not boot at all a few more attempts I got to a recover screen then after trying to recover windows 3 times, I finally got everything to run properly. I've had the machine for two weeks now with no more problems. I'm using the machine as emulator for a arcade i'm building so I think it does the job for a cheap gaming rig."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00GFG1B1A", "review": "Okay So read this review, if you're considering getting this pc. First off this pc, at the price for being on sale at $480. Is a steal. If you're looking to stream the web, play mid-low end games(We'll talk about this later) and anything else. This processor is a good one. Okay so the default graphics card is pretty bad. I could play some games no problem, Minecraft, Team fortress, other games like that. But this computer is perfect for upgrading. I just upgraded my power watt supply and gotten a GTX 960 for this pc. I was nervous about getting this PC because I didn't know what I was getting into. But I needed a PC to game and surf the web. It does all that. Hooked up 2 monitors right away, could even do 3 monitors but just didn't have a third :D. The keyboard they give you is really nice, and the mouse Is like any other mouse. So overall, If you're looking to buy a PC with your price budget. I think this is a good place to start. Like I said. I upgraded. This PC has so much room to upgrade which is nice. I thought I would write this review for people wondering to get this PC or not. I would recommend it(If its on sale). If not its still a good PC. Just go through your options before you get this one if its not on sale."}

They claim that nothing is wrong with it, but I cannot use the thing as is.\nI did purchase another of their PCs while this was in the shop...I'm hoping it lasts longer.\n\nUpdate:\nThe performance has just nose dived in the past few months. It is now so bad that even after reinstalling Windows (including a complete restore) the thing is barely operational. There's no dust, no modifications...the drive just seems to be dying.\nI know you can't really compare it with PCs, but my ancient HP is still running better than this thing with a boot time of 27 seconds where this, even on a clean drive is almost 2 minutes.\n\nThough it seemed to work well the first couple of months, the performance has went downhill since then. Just a few months after owning it one USB port stopped working and nothing I've tried seems to fix it. It will charge whatever I plug in but will not recognize it. That was annoying, but I just bought an adapter to give me extra ports.\n(Note: Both usbs were dead upon arrival but after a reboot became active, customer service was kind enough to help me. I have not taken the time to contact them for this new issue)\n\nAs for appearance and such:\nI was pleased that the bright blue lights do not stay on when the PC is in rest mode.\n\nThe fan is loud but not distracting in the least.\n\nWould I buy it again? Maybe...but I'd only buy again at a lower cost and after doing some more shopping.\nIt is a very solid, handsome piece.\n\nI plan to contact customer service before the warranty is up but at this time I just cannot afford to do without my PC to send it in for repairs."}

I bought this product over a year ago and it works great, but with the gt 610 graphics card the only games you'll be able to run at full frame rate are indie titles, and some older last gen games like bioshock and prototype. If you're looking to play current gen games or high end last gen games then you'll need to upgrade it.\n\nI recommend you replace the gt 610 with a 970 gtx card, or higher, to get the best performance there, and add in an extra 8 gb of ram in the second slot.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00GFG1B1A", "review": "I've built every system I've owned for 20 years but decided I just didn't have the time to build a new one this time around. I'm a lightweight user with some graphics needs for family and nature photo work, so gaming wasn't a concern. The reviews for CybertronPC seemed reasonable and the big attraction was standard off-the-shelf parts that were upgrade friendly and a licensed OS upgradeable to Windows 10.  I purchased this in July, put in a better sound card and second drive. I had no problems for 4.5 months with exception of very loud fans and humming from day one that would eventually settle after about 15-30 minutes.  Annoying. but not a deal-breaker.\n\nUntil yesterday.\n\nOne of the loud fans from day one was rattling/clicking in the 450W power supply.  I suspected this would be a problem from the start and now it has come home to roost.  The system randomly shuts down and once it starts shutting down it won't stay on for more than 5-30 seconds.  Doing some troubleshooting, I notice the CPU fan sometimes doesn't start or when it does moves sluggishly.  Watching in BIOS the fan starts at 400RPM and slowly gets to about 900RPM when the system shuts down.  By that time the CPU is at 197 degrees.  I also tried replacing the heat paste with silver paste to increase heat transfer.\n\nI likely have both a power supply problem (loud fan in it means failure soon) and a bad CPU fan (or underpowered CPU fan due to a bad power supply.)\n\nI'll update the review once I see what the resolution is."}

I was extremely impressed that Cybertron had technical support working through the Christmas holidays, including Christmas day, and got us up and running very quickly with easy to follow step by step guidance to reload the software and make sure everything was working properly.  Our son is thrilled with the performance (basic gaming like Minecraft, etc) and loves the really cool look of the machine.\n\n* It came extremely well packaged. Big box, plenty of packing material, all the CD's for software, etc. were included.\n* This computer case is huge, well ventilated, nice fans that glow, plenty of room for expansion, etc.  The downside is that you need to have a pretty large space available to put this large case - plan this out before purchase.\n* The fan is pretty noisy in comparison to other computers but this seems to be typical based on reviews that I have read.\n* We don't much like Windows 8 or even the offered 10, but we're all in the hands of Microsoft on this one.\n* This computer is fast for the kind of gaming my son does - he is very pleased.\n* Keyboard and mouse are included. We'd prefer a keyboard with USB connection so that we would have more cord available on the mouse and give us some flexibility.\n\nI am comfortable recommending the computer though it is still new.  My son's friends are impressed and claim that building their own equivalent would not save them money.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00GFG1B1A", "review": "PLEASE STOP LEAVING POSITIBE REVIEWS RIGHT AWAY JUST BECAUSE THEY WILL SEND A FREE SHIRT.\nEdit #1: The USB ports starting dying randomly while using the CPU. My keyboard or mouse would simply just die out for up to 10 seconds, which as you could already tell can be extremely infuriating to any gamer in the middle of a heated moment. Weeks after this started happening, the CPU just turned off completely and wouldnt turn back on. Power supply failure. Cybertron was quick in replying to the initial emails and a replacement was agreed upon; tracking information was assured within 2 days after I confirmed shipment back to the company. After 2 weeks, I heard nothing about the replacement part being sent back. I sent a follow-up email to see the status on the process. No response from Cybertron, and its been over two weeks.\n\nEdit #2:\n\nDO NOT GO WITH THIS PRODUCT. DO NOT GO WITH THIS PRODUCT. DO NOT GO WITH THIS PRODUCT. I can not say it enough.\n\nThe only thing worse than the machine is the customer support. The only reason you see so many high reviews on here is because the company basically bribes the customer into leaving one. Upon opening the package they offer a free shirt in exchange for a positive review. I've also spoke with plenty of people regarding this machine in efforts to trouble shoot mine, and so far the dozens of people all collectively had the same opinions; so I'm almost sure that the company makes profiles to leave good reviews. They do whatever they can to keep their product listed first for amazon shoppers, unaware of the much better products they could go with. When the computer starts getting under 4 stars, they simply make a new listing with the same exact product and fill up the reviews with fake positive ones. If you scroll down the review names a little bit you will see for yourself how many people here just have one review and product bought from amazon, and go figure its this product with a 5-star review. Anyways:\n\nWhats good:\n-Lights up and looks cool\n-Turns on\n\nWhats bad:\n-My tower has been giving me problems since the beginning. This is infuriating considering I'm in school and sometimes work from home, so I absolutely need at least a functioning computer. Within a couple weeks, the computer started to shut off randomly. Soon after that, the USB ports started dying out. Now, a couple of weeks ago, ONLY 9 MONTHS after using the computer, it completely fried. I don't put the computer through tons of abuse. The most graphically demanding game I play is league of legends. (Which also infuriated me, the mouse and keyboard would die out for 20 or so seconds while playing ultimately leading to me sure death in game, which is a big nono for gamers, the exact audience this machine is targeted for). Most of the time the computer rests in a well ventilated area.\n-Customer service is an absolute joke. Not only do you have to wait days in between replies, but they are completely unreliable. When my computer died, it was deemed to be an issue of the power supply. Instead of simply getting that replaced considering its still under the one year warranty, the customer rep demanded I sent in the whole tower and provided my password to \"run tests\". Upon more back and forth, finally we came to an agreement to replace the faulty power supply. The rep claimed to have shipping info to me in no more than two days. It wasn;t until about 3 weeks after that email that I even got the tracking number, even though I sent emails during the long wait to check up on the process and never got a response. After the tracking number, it still took a week to arrive. To top it all off, the power supply worked and the CPU turned on - however now the tower isn't sending a signal to my monitor. Just non-stop problems with this product. Sent an email to Cybertron right away, with pictures of my CPU and a list of steps I've tried. Took a week for a simple reply, and even though I sent a reply back to theirs literally a second after I received it, I'm still here a couple days after waiting for a second response.\n\nSo in conclusion, please don't make the same mistake I did. The product is lacking in serious quality, and the customer support is a joke. You can literally go with any other company or product and be happier with your choice. For now, while I wait another week to hear back from Cybertron, I'll be using my 4 year old laptop that never gave me any problems and went through the same treatment for games, and now I'm forced to travel to the library for school assignments considering I don't have another couple hundred dollars on me to replace this piece of crap computer."}

Didn't have to call customer service as PC started right up and in the 2-3 months I have had it, only froze once, which was easily corrected with a reboot.

Hopefully I will get to download a couple other games and give this bad boy a real test.

Looking back I wish I would have made my own computer but I knew nothing about building computers at the time. For anyone who is reading this I suggest go out an build your own. I calculated the parts that were put into this PC and it was only about $300. I spent $537 in total on this PC. They are charging $237 just to put the PC together!! If your just looking to plug and play then this is for you. If you actually want to save money take the time to build your own and learn about computers. I am currently in the process of building a $1300 computer and it is an amazing investment!"}

I would recommend buying a new Graphics card to go with it, as the one they provide (GeForce GT 610) Is kind of out of date. Another thing I would recommend buying is a New, Silent, AMD Based CPU fan. The CPU fan that comes stock in the machine is blastingly loud. I can hear it through my headphones when no audio is playing. My brother also said he could her the Bzzzz sound coming from his room. I upgraded the AMD Radeon XFX 6770 because It had a lot more processing power. What kinda sucks is that it only has one PCI-E slot that fits a graphics card. Over all, buy a new graphics card, and a new CPU fan, and your game."}

I purchased this PC w/no Software or Drivers of any kind installed on it, and knowing full well I was going to upgrade the Graphic Card. I also upgraded the Ram that CybertronPC offered. Over all this is a Great Purchase and I'm Very Happy with the machine and how it performs. I didn't have any trouble uploading the drivers and software for the Motherboard, LAN/Networking and BIOS. It all went smoothly, although the BIOS where already updated to it's most recent version (P.1). I'm running Dual Boot Windows 7 with Linux Mint 17.2. Both run Perfectly. I would definitely recommend this PC to any of my friends and family and anyone else for that matter. If you're on the limb about purchasing this PC. Just do it, you want regret it.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00GFG1B1A", "review": "JANUARY 2016 EDIT:\nFeel free to read the rest of my initial review below, but the most recent (and probably most important) stuff is in this update!\n\nIn short, this is a very good deal for the money, and CybertronPC is a very good company to work with. As some have noted, if you want to run current, demanding video games, you will need to upgrade the video card. But that aside, this is a good starter machine, either for a beginning gamer, or for an experienced one looking for a base machine to build on.\n\nI did have issues with my Borg-Q, as detailed below. However, it should be noted that the motherboard's built-in safety features kicked in when needed and my data was saved. Put another way, NONE of the issues I've had have resulted in a loss of data, so despite more troubleshooting than I would have liked, I haven't lost ANYTHING. To me, that's more critical than a few inconveniences here and there.\n\nBut the most important factor, and the reason for this update today, is the willingness of CybertronPC to make me a happy customer. Yes, I have had problems. But each and every time their tech support staff was exceedingly friendly and helpful. This can not be overstated, especially considering how lousy customer support can be these days. No kidding, CybertronPC's tech support is excellent. I hope you never have to deal with them, but if you do you'll be in good hands.\n\nSo yes, I have had some issues with my Borg-Q. Most were due to faulty equipment and were not CybertronPC's fault. To be sure, they take great care putting these machines together; they aren't just slapped together and shipped out! Mistakes can happen though, and components can fail. But regardless of what the issues were, they have done a very good job making me feel like I matter to them as a customer. That really makes a difference to me, and for that reason I'd recommend CybertronPC to anyone looking to buy a very good, very well put-together machine. I would buy this machine again, and I would definitely buy from CybertronPC again.\n\nThanks for all of your help, CybertronPC!\n\nMy original review starts here:\n\nAfter a really long spell of not having a decent machine, I finally lucked into enough cash to get myself something nice. I had a budget in mind of around $500, give or take a little. I spent a good couple of weeks browsing different sites, looking at machines, and trying to narrow down the pool to just a handful of candidates. I was very close to pulling the trigger on a DIY system from another online retailer, but I hesitated. Turns out, I've lost my tube of Arctic Silver, and since I don't build many machines these days I didn't really want to buy another tube that would one day end up lost just like the tube that came before it!\n\nSo anyway, that ended up being the deciding factor. I emptied that DIY system out of my cart, came back to Amazon, and ordered up a Borg-Q. I was very pleased with its specs, and with its price (when I ordered it, it was just barely over my budget of $500). One of the features that had impressed me so much was the memory: it came with 8 GB, and was expandable to 32 GB! I figured that would last me well into the next few years without having to upgrade my motherboard. I was also pretty pleased with the GeForce GT 610 that came with it. Unlike some reviewers, I was actually pretty happy with what it could do without an upgrade. I play a older game, The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, but there are a number of mods and utilities that can seriously update the game's graphics, provided you have a powerful enough video card to support it. I was a little nervous based on what some reviewers had said about that GT 610, but I am happy to report that it exceeded my expectations. I am able to run Morrowind configured with MGE XE at 1600 X 900, with several shaders active, real-time shadows, and very pleasing distant land!\n\nBut unfortunately my experience wasn't all great. When I first got the machine from UPS, I noticed something through the see-through side panel that troubled me. Instead of the four RAM slots I expected to see, this motherboard only had two. Now there are, in fact, some 16 GB sticks available out there, but the MSI 760GMA-P34 (FX) motherboard in my machine will not support them. No, this board maxes out at 16 GB, and that's just all there is to it. But you know, as disappointed as I was, I was actually prepared to let it go when I saw the power supply my Borg-Q came with; instead of the 450 W supply I expected, my machine came with a 550 W one! That allowed me greater flexibility for adding parts in the future, particularly when it comes to video cards. A bigger power supply means I can potentially run more powerful GPUs. But then, just a few days after I received my machine, the CPU fan started to screech. I've been around computers long enough to know that's bad news, especially for a brand new fan. So it was at this point that I called CybertronPC's tech support.\n\nI have to tell you, I hope you never have to call them (because that would most likely mean something is wrong, and I wouldn't wish that on you). But if you do have to call them, be prepared for a good experience because they are truly exceptional folks! Regarding the fan, the fellow I spoke with initially was very quick to send me a new one, no questions asked. I didn't even have to return the old one... just wait for the new one to arrive, swap it out with the bad one, and that's it! As it turns out, it became a little more complicated than that when the new fan arrived and I realized it didn't quite match up with the old one. But again, their tech support came through and we were able to work something out that satisfied me in the end.\n\nThere was still the issue of the motherboard not supporting 32 GB of RAM though, and I was determined to come to a resolution that was satisfactory from my point of view. This process ended up taking several days and several phone calls, but ultimately we worked something out. As I had suspected, when the Borg-Q GM4213A models were initially made, they did, in fact, come with Gigabyte motherboards that supported up to 32 GB of RAM. But since then things have changed, and the Borg-Qs shipping these days have a different motherboard (the MSI one I have). The questions on the Borg-Q's Amazon page (for the GM4213A model) were asked a while back, when the machines still had those 32 GB max motherboards in them. When the change was made, the folks at CybertronPC didn't come over here to update their answers to the max RAM questions. Plus, from what I understand, there actually were some of the original Gigabyte machines in Amazon's warehouses, so for a while it was kind of like a roll of the dice to determine which machine you got.\n\nTo CybertronPC's credit, they did offer to replace the machine with one of the Gigabyte 32 GB max machines. But as I told the three tech support reps I talked to, swapping out the machine was a big inconvenience for me at that point. I'd had the machine for a good week and a half by then, and in that time I had upgraded to Windows 10 and installed a lot of software. I also had logins and other personal info on the machine that would need to be wiped before I could send it back to them. It was just too much trouble, and the whole thing was exacerbated by a neurological disease I am battling that makes all of this stuff that much harder. I told them that, and for what it's worth I really believe the tech support folks I spoke with truly wanted to get me the best deal they possibly could. They all seemed genuinely sincere, and they all tried really hard to satisfy me.\n\nIn the end, they offered me another 8 GB stick of RAM, but I had to pay for it at a discounted rate. To be honest, I was a little disappointed with that, but I can say that their tech support folks were great! Despite the outcome of my situation being a bit less than I'd hoped, I can honestly say that their people made me feel like they were trying as hard as they could to reach a positive outcome. For that reason alone, I would definitely recommend a CybertronPC... just make sure you know what you're getting before you place your order!"}

In my spare time, I help my wife's family business with their simple network - less than 10 workstations.  Last year, we bought some Lenovo all-in-ones, which have been a disaster - fragile, buggy, SLOW, and utterly filled with bloatware.  Earlier this week, one failed in spectacular style.\n\nI needed a reasonably-priced PC fast.  I ordered the CybertronPC Borg-Q GM4213A based on the price and reviews, and because it was significantly more powerful than a basic entry-level compact desktop unit.  I love this computer already.\n\nPros:\n-  It's plenty powerful for office applications.\n-  Even the keyboard and mouse are name band components.\n-  VERY clean Windows install.  Literally no bloatware, other than what Microsoft includes. It took less than 5 minutes to remove unwanted items, compared to hours on the Lenovo units.\n-  Good value\n-  Very open case, with plenty of room for expansion, fans, etc.\n-  Basically, it reminded me of buying a Gateway or Dell computer in the 1990s - Good components, good value, easy installation.\n\nCons - and these are very minor:\n-  I didn't see an easy way to turn off the blue LEDs.  (They are fine for home, but a little gaudy in an office PC.)\n-  CPU fan is a little noisy\n-  Came with Windows 8.1 (but I immediately upgraded for free, and the clean windows install made it a fast process)\n\nI absolutely recommend this product.  When - inevitably - the rest of our Lenovo's die, I'm buying more CybertronPCs."}

Line a 24cm square baking tin with greaseproof paper. In a large bowl over some simmering water, melt the butter and the chocolate and mix until smooth. Add the cherries and nuts, if you're using them, and stir together.\n\nIn a separate bowl, mix together the cocoa powder, flour, baking powder and sugar, then add this to the chocolate, cherry and nut mixture. Stir together well. Beat the eggs and mix in until you have a silky consistency.\n\nPour your brownie mix into the baking tray, and place in the oven for around 25 minutes. You don't want to overcook them so, unlike cakes, you don't want a skewer to come out all clean. The brownies should be slightly springy on the outside but still gooey in the middle.\n\nAllow to cool in the tray, then carefully transfer to a large chopping board and cut into chunky squares. These make a fantastic dessert served with a dollop of cr&egrave;me frache mixed with some orange zest."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00GFG1B1A", "review": "As someone whose last gaming PC was an IBM PS/1 back in the early 90s, this machine is great.  After that, I owned a Compaq and then a long series of mid-range and low range Dell PCs.  Hardcore gamers would rate this machine much lower, but for the money, it's fantastic.\n\nThe reasons I have given this machine 5 stars are as follows-\n\nFirst off, would be the price point.  For its ability as a ready-to-go desktop it's priced wonderfully.  The machine is assembled in the USA.  If you've never heard of Cybertron and are used to HP, Dell, Compaq or whatever and are wondering about the risk, let me say, the customer service with Cybertron is awesome.  The first machine I got was DOA.  I simply sent tech services an IM question about the instability of the machine.  They responded within minutes.  This lead to a phone call, and they walked me through checking the hardware components.  The problem seemed to deeper and without me demanding or even asking, they offered to send a new tower.  The second tower has worked flawlessly.  After dealing with Dell tech support over the years, and massive DOS manuals before that, this was, by far and away, the best tech support I have ever dealt with.\nAnother reason for the five stars would have be the massive case and the upgrade readiness of the Borg-Q.  Hardcore gamers would give this low marks just off the stock video card alone.  I bought this system specifically for Word of Tanks, Mechwarrior Online, and World of Warships.  In its stock form it could somewhat run those titles on the lowest graphics settings with decent frame rate most of the time.  With Cybertron's massive case, I was able to squeeze an Asus GTX 970 video card into the system with a larger power supply.  That woke up the potential of the system!  The last time I changed hardware was in 1994 in the good ole PS/1, so I thought this was going to be interesting.  I was wrong, and with the layout and room inside the Cybertron case, the swap out was relatively quick and easy.  I also added some fans to encourage air circulation since the video card was large enough to essentially divide the case into two compartments.  The layout inside the case of Cybertron's PC seems to be laid out the way I would do it.  Everything is spaced away from everything else and the power cables are neatly routed and accessible.  There is no need for finding somebody with tiny hands or tediously reaching into tiny places with needle nose pliers and a flashlight.\nI have a relative that works in IT for large firms.  When I listed off the brand names of the components, he agreed they were in fact quality brands as Cybertron claims.\nI don't want to sound like a paid spokesperson, but this is a fine machine, especially if you're just getting into gaming on a budget.  I would recommend the video card upgrade and a power supply to match.\n\nI included before and after pictures of the video card upgrade.\n\n***UPDATE***\n\nSome of you have complained about the noise in your reviews, and yes, the way the tower arrives from Cybertron, it is very noisy.  I have recently solved the noise problem.  The sleeve bearing fan by Master Cool on the CPU cooler is the source of the noise.  The fan was always noisy, but recently began to make horrific \"my service life is nearly over\" noises.  I purchased a new cooler from AMD (the manufacturers of the CPU) and installed it.  Now the there is the quiet sound of the air movement from the case fans, but no droning overbearing fan sound that it had before.  I was surprised that all of that noise was coming from the MasterCool sleeve bearing fan.\n\n***Another UPDATE***\n\nI would like to add that as of March 2016, with the stock CPU, new CPU cooler, Asus STRIX GTX 970, and the stock 8 gig RAM stick, I am running World of Warships with the graphics maxed out at 55 fps +/- 5 fps at 1920 x 1080.  World of Tanks runs similarly.  Mechwarrior Online runs maxed out at 60+ fps but can dip to 30 fps at times also at 1920 x 1080.  Cities Skylines runs maxed out smoothly as well as the latest Sim City.  I am still loving this PC."}

Now since I'm a hardcore gamer and love max settings on games I knew for a fact that it wouldn't perform games on max settings such as Tera, Blade and Soul but as soon as i changed the graphics card to an EVGA GeForce GTX 960 SuperSC ACX 2.0+ Graphics Card - 4 GB this cheap computer became a monster. I will upgrade other things as i go. I know that graphics card is overkill but it's worth it. Even though the minimal power for the card is 400w i will upgrade the power supply to 750w soon just for safety precautions. My friend even admitted that this computer upgraded is on par with his and he spent way more building his. As soon as I fully upgrade the computer I will write how it's going.\n\nP.S.

So far I have upgraded the graphics card (GeForce GTX 960 2GB), processor (AMD FX-8320), and power supply (520W). I needed to upgrade the power supply because the stock one did not have (2x 6pin PCIe) or a (8pin PCIe) which are needed when upgrading to certain graphics cards. The computer runs amazing now and better than ever. Do not expect this computer to run like a $2000 gaming computer, because its not.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00GFG1B1A", "review": "This pc is amazing. I couldn't build one this good, this cheap. Largest reason for the price though is it comes with a lower priced graphics card. I haven't paid for cable in years. I had just been using my good old PS3 for Netflix Hulu and hbogo. Cummulative $30 a month. But now that Sony decided to start charging for using their online network with their newest console, the ps4. I decided I was going back to my roots and buying a good pc.\nThat's what I learned to play games on back in the late 80's and early 90's. It felt good to go back to it.  I had continued to game on my old pc for years but really hadn't since 2012 cause it was getting too old.\n\nSo I purchased with the intent of gaming. For which the graphics card needed upgraded. Now the graphics card it comes with isn't bad. It'll play videos and most applications no problem. But for my heavy duty games it needed a little more power in graphics. Spent 160 on a baller graphics card. And it's just a 10 minute upgrade requiring no hard thinking. Quite literally unplug old one, plug in new one. Run software disk, tadaa.\n\nI've read several reviews about bad power supplies. Even with the giant graphics card I still haven't had one singular problem with that or anything else. And even if I did. Power supplies aren't expensive nor difficult to instal.\nMy next install is going to be a solid state hard drive solely for running windows and the other necessary programs. And leaving the terabyte for movies games word files and unnecessary programs.\n\nBut for the record; It runs like a champ. And now that I've adjusted to windows 8 I actually kinda prefer it. The new dashboard is great for multitasking. Even when gaming, just a quick press of the windows (start symbol) key on my keyboard takes me to my dashboard.\n\nMy name is bo, I live in ky. I'm not a computer expert but I know more than most. But even my best friend a veteran corporate employed computer tech was impressed for what I got for the price. So was the geek squad tech at best buy. Where they also sale this exact same brand of computer. I give you my personal assurance;  No matter what your level of expertise you will be very satisfied."}

I have been impressed with the quality and speed so far. Looking forward to the windows 10 update in a couple days. We aren't \"gamers\" but I wanted something that had some power and I was tired with the typically name brands computers that never seemed to live up to expectations. I use this computer to run my software for my garbage company and do all my accounting/billing and it seems to process everything very quickly with no lag doing multiple programs at the same time. Looking forward to working with this company more in the future."}

The manufacturor decided to put an outdated pci slot instead of a express pci slot and then shoved a incompatible overclocked nvidia 610 graphics card. This is a screaming fire hazard. Also the supposed 8 gigabytes of ram is just a 2 gigabyte stick of RAM with a modified bios file. So yes a bunch of liars."}

I can only assume it was a software issue and not a hardware one, but at this point I no longer have the diagnostic tools on this computer to actually find out.\n\nI have no idea what could possibly have caused this, and as I am still on hold with the cybertron support team after being assured I am number 1 in the queue and that I will be joined by support in 1 minute for the past 10 minutes, I am not that hopeful of help from them any time soon.

I'm a former computer professional who has built in excess of 100 custom PCs in my time, so I have high standards when it comes to computers (too high, unfortunately, for me to be able to build their computer this time!). When the Borg-Q arrived, it was well packed, and the first thing that impressed me was a name-brand keyboard and mouse (Logitech) as I fully expected no-name components. The computer fired up flawlessly and has run perfectly ever since for two very happy kids since we got it. Having an easily upgradeable, non-proprietary system means we can always build on this foundation when the need arises (and cash flows in!). Very happy with the purchase!"}

I could not find my Windows CD key so I sent them an email asking about 9pm... they responded at 4am telling me where it was, this was surprising to me, apparently they have staff members at all hours of the day, excellent customer service.  I will recommend this and any other PC Cybertron sells."}

Should be an easy remedy, but an unnecessary hassle. Overall, very good product."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00GFG1B1A", "review": "As a college student, I function on a minimum budget. Unfortunately, finding a solid gaming pc for under $600 is an endeavor all its own. That in mind, you all know how skeptical I was about the Cybertron Borg-Q. However, I was pleasantly surprised. It came well packaged, and was easy to set up upon arrival. The graphics card is decent, but could use an upgrade. All around a good gaming pc for light to moderate gaming usage. The best part about the Borg-Q however isn't the computer itself, but rather, Cybertron's warranty policy. Within the allotted warranty time, owners of a Cybertron pc can upgrade ANY individual parts of the pc without voiding the warranty. That my friends is quality service and the Borg-Q was all around a great purchase!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00GFG1B1A", "review": "Ordered this PC a few days ago and have had a couple days to test everything out. When it arrived everything was very well packaged and there wasn't anything shaking around. Got it out of the box, plugged it in and it worked immediately. Got everything set up and, just a couple days later, so far so good. The GPU is definitely the weakest link here but for most basic gaming needs it will get the job done. Obviously it won't handle Witcher  3 on ultra or anything but for my purposes it does a great job and is very fast. Overall a good purchase (got mine for $450) and a good foundation to be upgraded in the future. In a couple months I plan to upgrade to a GTX 750 Ti SC and then I should be set for quite a while. All in all 5/5 a solid purchase for anyone wanting to get a decent starting gaming PC"}

And, to be honest, I want the shirt I get for reviewing to recommend it to others.\nEdit: After using this computer for a bit longer it is still good for certain games, it can handle the games I want to handle such as CS:GO at decent frames but it is FAR from being able to play games such as Borderlands 2 at 60 fps. However I am still satisfied with this purchase and I have made several changes to it such as for a new case I went with a Rosewill Thor v2 and a 750 psu. I plan to upgrade to an Asrock Fatal1ty Gaming 990FX Killer along with an EVGA 960 ftw 4gb and a FX-8350 with water cooling.

I subsequently returned this pc however I was very impressed with the case which offers good cable management and ventilation options. Prior to purchase I went to the manufacturer's website to read the specs on this model which is offered for sale there as well. Since the unit on amazon has the exact same model number of the one on the manufacturer's website, I expected to receive a unit that matched those specifications. Upon opening the case, I discovered that the motherboard I received had only two ram slots instead of the claimed four at the manufacturer's site (their site has since been updated so I'm guessing I got caught in the midst of a hardware change at the manufacturer). I believe the model offered by amazon had different specs it shouldn't have been listed with the same model number as it feels like a bait and switch however I believe this is the manufacturer's fault, not amazon.. if the number of ram slots doesn't matter to you, this may well be a good purchase for you. I never booted up my unit before returning it so I can't comment on performance."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00GFG1B1A", "review": "This was a replacement PC for our basement, where the kids use mostly Steam games (TF2, L4D, Minecraft) after it went south. On paper the spec's look strong, but the real weakness (as everyone else notes) is the video card. The 610 just isn't strong. In my case, the prior PC had an HD 6850 that I swapped out. The Power supply is marked as 550w, so wasn't worried. So far so good.\n\nThe good things are the CPU, memory and GPU can all be upgraded. So in a year I can pick up a newer CPU and drop it in for more power. I'm sure Warcraft and GuildWars would be fine on here; Crysis and BF4 at high res, not so much until you put upgrades in. The case is plastic, which is fine for me, but some might not like that. The fans are ok, not loud but you can hear them. *** I'm not an overclocker, but the software is there to boost the CPU. I tried it once, and the CPU halted and rebooted. I don't trust it.\n\nIt's best described as an entry gaming rig. You can play BF4, but expect chop until you upgrade the video card. The real value for me is knowing in 12 or 24 months i can drop in a new CPU. The Amazon price algo kicked in; since I didn't care what color led's we had, i grabbed RED (which was $505) when I went today to review and looked at the price, it was suddenly $565! As a general rule, that's kinda sketchy, but i get why it happens.\n\nThe truth is, if you are willing to build a game rig part by part over time, this is a good base. If you want to open it and go max res in Battlefield 4, go with one of the higher end units."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00GFG1B1A", "review": "I bought this PC because my HP Desktop that I had moderately upgraded for gaming was dying - it was 8 years old and I knew that anyday it was going to quit.  I had read lots of reviews online and I know hardcore gamers usually recommend something in the \"much more expensive range\", however, I needed something in this price range that would still be a solid system and play the game I love - Guild Wars 2.  I did a lot of online research of game system reviews before buying this system also, so I felt very secure in my purchase.  So... my HP died the day this computer arrived - what timing!  And it is great!  I was so happy - its very fast.  I loaded up my Guild Wars 2 just as the new Lions Arch update kicked in - the graphics are amazing!  For the first time I saw the game with the graphics settings boosted up and wow!  I also can now swap between programs, so I can take care of my business on this system, game and check Dulfy.net all at the same time... no delay, no lock ups, no problems...I am so happy with this purchase.\n\nSo, I am a woman, close to 40, who loves to game.  Also, I am a Mom who is always hunting for quality at a bargain price... I need to feel like I got a deal.  I bought the blue because it was $30-$50 less than the red and green.  That part was unimportant to me, but I have to admit, it runs and looks very, very cool.  This was a great purchase.  I am also happy if I want, I can upgrade parts, but I think it runs fine as it is.\n\nI honestly, and this has nothing to do with the PC, am not a fan of Windows 8, but it came with a free upgrade to Windows 10, so I am ever hopeful it will look and feel more like Windows 7 or Vista... the more classic non App looking style of older windows."}

The PC is blazing fast even with Windows 8.1, The best part is you can upgrade the processors graphics card and ram anytime you want! Non proprietary parts! Im upgrading it currently to a AMD Eight Core Processor, and upgrading to a 4GB GeForce graphics card. Man is this PC gonna roar with the newer games! Anyways this PC stock is great for daily users and casual gamers, I haved tried a few games that aren't so graphic heavy like L4D and L4D 2 at max settings and get no framedrop or lag, The PC fans are very silent depending on what your doing, they do get louder once you do heavier stuff like play graphic games or render videos, I have never seen the CPU usuage past 40% no matter what I'm doing, I have not tried overclocking or none of that and don't plan on to. In Conclusion if this is your first high end PC I recommend you GET IT ASAP!! You won't regret it, buy this and buy a Panda Wireless USB adapter for blazing fast wireless connection, If this PC wasn't so big I'd unplug it everynight and sleep with it on my bed.

I decided it was time to try something different. I searched through Amazon for a variety of PCs, but I wanted something that was easy to modify and upgrade. After reading the majority of reviews on the Cybertron GM4213A, I decided to take the plunge.  The unit arrived well packed with all the hardware necessary to upgrade the system, .ie., hard drive rails, screws, and cd-roms. When was the last time you received a cd-rom with your computer purchase?! I installed a hard drive, Blueray burner, upgraded hard-drive, and beefed-up power supply.  It was a refreshing change to work with a computer that was designed for easy upgrades. Lots of room to work in the case. I found the processing power of the cpu to more than adequate for my needs. My work on the computer consists mostly of radio signal acquisition and image processing.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00GFG1B1A", "review": "Keep in mind I ordered a brand new PC. I was so excited to get started on PC gaming, yet to be disappointed. When I first saw the PC, It looked spanking new and dust free. That includes the inside. I was able to start it up right away, BUT I notice that the start up had a sign IN only. I was confused because there wasn't any sign UP button anywhere. I called Microsoft support, and they said it SHOULD start up with a sign up button. I also saw that it said \"Other User\" at the top of the screen. Then I began to realize, I got a USED PC. I already had a Microsoft account, so of course I tried to sign in many times. I'm not sure if this was to test the PC, but I couldn't do anything at all. I wanted to reset the PC as well, but I HAD to sign in. Big disappointment. Now, I have to replace it.\n\nUPDATE 3/10/16:\nSince I had the 2 year warranty, I was able to get a replacement, and I am very satisfied. I tested this baby for about 6-7 months, and had no major issues. However, throughout the useage, I notice some bugs. There is a code to verify, which is printed on the top right side of the PC, and the computer had a little bit of trouble issuing it. I knew it wasn't me typing it incorrectly because I re-type it about 5 times, so I just gave up for about 1 month and kept ignoring the pop-up for the code. Eventually, I was able to get the code through.\nAnother odd issue, was the PC randomly starting up. I had to unplug the whole thing, just so it wouldn't waste electricity. It might've had something to do with the code variation because it stopped after the code was verified. Unfortunately, this PC is not compatible for using Wi-Fi , and requires a internet cable cord for internet access. Other than that, I experienced minimal lag with gaming and internet browsing."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00GFG1B1A", "review": "After my 2011 Lenovo laptop started dying on me (overheating), I needed to get a new computer for gaming purposes. Being on a budget, I decided to give this computer a try, especially given its very high ratings on Amazon. Long story short, I returned it the day after I received it. This was the first Amazon product that I had to return, and they immediately gave me a full refund. I am very satisfied with Amazon's service in this regard.\n\nRegarding what is wrong with this particular computer:\n\n- The most major problem is the noise. Let me put it this way. I have been using computers for almost 20 years now, and never in my life I have seen a computer (forget about a -new- computer) make this much noise. The company's main argument in this context is that the cables can usually get stuck in between the fan blades so this creates the noise. I have checked all the fans myself and made sure that there are no cables or anything stuck around. The noise is still there. The only explanation that I was able to come up with is the cheap choice of fans that are used in the build. The external fans are the $5 ones that you can get in any hardware store. I am not much of an expert on the CPU fans, but the CPU fan was by itself very loud too. So, quieting this computer down will probably require replacing all of the three fans inside. The noise issue by itself pretty much makes this computer unusable. I am guessing that the people who gave 5 stars to this computer somehow got lucky and got higher quality fans (or they are deaf?).\n\n- The graphics card. Unfortunately, the card is very weak. Tried out a couple of games that were running smoothly on my Lenovo (which had a 2gig card), the card just cannot handle them. I was kind-of expecting a weak card, but I honestly was not expecting such a weak card. Even if you would somehow be able to tolerate the noise, you will definitely need a new card to run any recent (and by recent I mean 6-7 year-old games) game in a reasonable manner.\n\n- I did not have much chance to test the CPU itself.\n\n- This is not about the computer in particular, but, man, Windows 8... This was the first time I came across to this abomination they call an operating system. Who designs these interfaces?\n\nTo summarize, this computer is actually quite overpriced given its performance. It should probably be worth around 300-350, but definitely not more than that. Even if it will be sold at that price, it should stay in another room with cables extended/wirelessly connected so that you will not lose your mind because of the noise. I had really high expectations of this product, and quite unhappy that it turned out to be this way. Small companies should strive for better high-quality products instead of trying to sell overpriced junk. It appears that one should always go for the \"big names\" in order to avoid headache."}

First is I cant figure out how to get it to play SOUND on my speakers or headphones!! I even reinstalled windows. When I first turned the computer on the sound worked. But after updating windows and the gfx drivers it no longer plays. It says its detecting my headphones and it says its playing sound. Ive tried both speakers and headphones and ive tried all the plugs. Both back and front. Im at a lost here. Ive also tried updating the realtek hd audio drivers.\n\nThe only other problem I have had with it is it wouldnt fit my GTX 960(Gigabyte Windforce) on the motherboard. So now im going to have to sell that on ebay and get a 750 ti(which isn't a bad card but I would have prefered to keep my 960. If I had known it wouldnt fit I would have gotten a different model).\n\nUpdate:I bought a usb headset. The sound works just fine now. It must be a problem with the jacks. Still I would have preferred not to spend an extra $30 in order to have audio."}

The lighting looks great, and the only quip I could make about the computer is that the fans are slightly loud, not so loud that it is distracting or annoying, but you do hear them.\n\nThe case feels great, and looks good. My first thought when I saw it in person was, \"ooh pretty...\" Which I think is a good thing. Set up was easy, and I really don't mind the Windows 8.1 there is a bit of getting used to, but if you want to shut it down quickly, instead of left clicking the start screen, right click it for a menu, most of the useful windows stuff is right there.\n\nI bought this PC because of the reviews on here. It was better reviewed compared to the next closest one I was looking at. It also helped that it fell nicely into the price range of what I wanted. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a good entry level Gaming PC, or just wants some color on their desktop."}

Every game Ive played has never ran smooth on any setting adjustments. Every PC gamer Ive met laughed when I told them I bought a prebuilt machine then told me that for around the same price I could have had a  i5 that would tear through any game and alow me to upgrade unlike this build thats gonna need a power supply and CPU very soon which means the low grade motherboard will need to go aswell and so on.

Once my PC with XP on it crashed for the last time, I just bought a laptop...and another...and another. So finally I got sick of not having a desktop/not being able to play games so I shopped around and bought this PC.\nWOW. It's great for a starter PC, or just a framework for a PC like if you wanted to upgrade the parts. Which I intend to do. Stock, though this PC is great. The processor and motherboard handle multitasking very well. No stutters or issues or freezing. The graphics card can handle Fallout 3 and Skyrim on High settings for me with no lag or stutters. Not sure what the frame rate is, but it does look better than on PS3. Especially Fallout. The keyboard and mouse that came with are fairly standard stuff. I bought a trackball mouse. The CD drive and USB ports work well, and having an HDMI port on this PC is awesome cause I hooked it up to my TV. I did have to fiddle with the resolution a bit, but it looks great now.\n\nThe only problems I have are that the fans (particularly the one mounted to the case with the blue LEDs on it) are a little loud, but that's to be expected. The front USB ports a little finicky, they don't read some things, but what they don't read, are easily read in the back ports...weird.\n\nOverall, this PC is a great bargain, and I would recommend it to anyone not wanting to build a PC or spend tons of money."}

I didn't have any of the issues where the computer didn't work for me at all or whatever. The computer works, however, when I got the computer, I was told it was good for gaming, which turned out not to be even slightly true. This computer had an extremely difficult time running a lot of the games I liked to play on it and I was only able to play the games I enjoy as long as I was playing them in the worst possible qualities. So if you're looking to get this computer just to have a computer to do regular stuff on like social media and what have you, go for it. But if you're a gamer looking for a gaming computer, I would strongly advise looking elsewhere. Also, Cybertron's customer service is the worst I've ever witnessed in my life, and that is truly saying something. I waited on the phone for 37 minutes, when they finally just hung up on me. I waited for twenty minutes after, and they hung up on me AGAIN. I have no doubt in my mind that had I been buying a computer from them they would pick up that phone fairly quickly, if not immediately. They will never see a penny from me again."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00GFG1B1A", "review": "Extremely disappointed. I wanted to chalk up the negative reviews as infantile complaints (as some were downright silly) and figured those saying this item arrived DOA did not know that there was a simple power switch in the back. I really really had very high hopes for this machine. I even did a video recording unboxing of it and set it up as carefully as possible. Well, to my disdain, this pc is a COMPLETE mess. Not only is there an incessant beeping from missing ram, but the Hard drive stays stuck on REPAIR. Perhaps a reformat would fix the hard drive issue, but a hard drive that is NEW should NOT arrive with this sort of problem. Furthermore, how sloppy would someone be to forget ram? I had ram to pop in, but that made zero difference as the machine CONTINUED to beep and the Hard drive simply did not function as it should have. Cybertron includes a really neat poster indicating how to set the pc up (although it's sad they have to, you'd think someone purchasing a gaming pc would know these details) and then a note that asks kindly to contact THEM before any reseller. Although, I am so grateful I purchased this through Amazon. Imagine having to deal with Cybertron for solutions for such outrageous gaffes from a NEW PRODUCT?! Simply unacceptable. Amazon's top notch customer service has shipped me over a replacement--I will either modify this review later on down the line or add more to it and get my money back. First experience was awful--and I can tell you first hand, if you are searching for a gaming pc-LOOK ELSEWHERE because these guys seem to be either HIT or MISS much of the time. So if this is a birthday gift purchase or something of the special gift kind, don't be too surprised if your item arrives defective in more ways than one. Unfortunate from a company trying to build its reputation. But solid on Amazon's end for being willing to fix the issues!"}

First of all, the packaging, because that was what I was the most hesitant about. I have never ordered a computer online before and then deduced if Amazon is happy, I will be happy.\n\nSmall preface. I am not a gamer. I did not buy this to be a gaming computer. I do not have time to be a gamer, nor will I in the near future. However, I am an engineer. The computers I am accustomed to working on can easily be thousands of dollars more than some of the best gaming computers. I needed this computer for the procesing power and ability to multitask. When I get home from work and I have to use the computer, the last thing I want to do is sit down in front of Fred Flinstone with a chisel, trying to hack out my internet requests. While one thing is loading, I usually have at least one other - and often 3 or more - items loading right behind it. Multitasking! Therefore, I bought the CybertronPC Borg-Q.\n\nI have only had the computer for about a week or two. Initial thoughts? It runs! It runs quickly! Hooray. Most brand new computers run quickly out of the box. I did something different on this purchase though. I bought the gaming computer because they are all made with closer to cutting edge components. The CybertronPC is made out of all \"off the shelf\" equipment making it 100% upgradable. That in itself is impressive enough! I also decided to opt for a TV in place of the monitor because I had seen higher yields in visual graphics (similar to gaming computers) to those akin to regular LED monitors.\n\nI have loaded as much as I can get my grubby mits on and stuffed it into the plentifully sized hard drive. All of which slowed the computer down 0%. Not a typo. That is ZERO percent! Very impressive. I have flogged this poor computer with some of my most intensive tasks and it chucked at me. Also impressive. I am not all that but when it comes to computers, forgiving is not something I become.\n\nUntil I start throwing graphics intense demands at this poor computer, I have to say I am 100% satisfied. I knew the graphics card was not suitable for the expectations I have. Virtually none are in that price point. But I have the graphics card I need now and I have no hesitation against throwing anything I can do at work towards this beefy computer.\n\nAesthetics? It's a computer. It looks pretty cool. It has a clear side panel that lights up with a internal LED. The fans are loud but I knew they would be to keep a machine like this cool enough.\n\nSoftware/Bloatware? Um. Pass! No software or bloatware that I noticed other than the icon for technical difficulties and warantee issues. Everything else is as clean as you can get it!\n\nOver, I love this computer. It is going to take me a little bit to get used to Windows 8.1 but I am coming along. Just remembering where everything IS instead of where it USED TO BE is my current obstacle. As or right now, the only thing I wish I would have done differently was buy this computer sooner!"}

The keyboard and mouse are really nice too! Many people would think that a $560 computer can't game, but this one can! I am able to get 130 FPS on Minecraft while recording with few settings turned down. I also downloaded games from steam, and you can play almost anything at low or medium graphics no problem. The fans are very quiet for a computer, I don't even know the computer is there sometimes. I also looked in the inside for later upgrades and everything is so neat and tidy. When I got the computer it came with some extra free-bee stuff, all the part info, and some extra slot parts. It is hands-down just such a great purchase! You never get this kind of reliability and customer service from other computer companies, it's awesome."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00GFG1B1A", "review": "Ok, so this isn't the most expensive rig and you get what you pay for. Having said that, it is ready to run and a pretty good value for the price. You could certainly build a better machine for the price if you are willing to buy and assemble the individual parts but that wasn't an option. I needed a serviceable PC quickly.\n\nRecommended upgrades -\n\nThe hard drive is VERY slow. you'll probably want to swap that out at some point.\n\nThe video card won't handle games very well. Be prepared to put the video settings at the bottom end of the spectrum unless you upgrade that.\n\nThe good news it that I put in an SSD and new GPU. The power supply handled it (a little surprised by that) and it makes a great machine for the kid's games and general use."}

I ordered it to be a back-up gaming computer since already have an Alienware X51 that cost me nearly a 1000 dollars. Other than not being a big fan of Windows 8.1 I am completely satisfied with my CybertronPC Borg-Q GM4213A, the first thing was to upgrade the graphics card to a NVIDIA GTX-650. I mainly play Star Trek Online and I can run it on max settings and it plays just fine. There might be just a slight lag between it and my X-51 with its i7 Quadcore Pentium Processor, but it is barely noticeable. Overall the Cybertron cost about half of what my X-51 cost and still gives great performance. It has plenty of space for other upgrades also. I give it a 4 out of 5 Stars."}

I received the tower in excellent packaging, nothing damaged or loose. Very easy to set-up. It runs extremely fast and does a great job. Going to upgrade the graphics card to take full advantage of the system, but for a starter it works well (medium settings in games for smooth play, higher graphics will put some strain on the card). The USB 3.0 ports are amazing (my first PC to have them), and the 8GB RAM adds significant speed. About 1-1.5 minutes from turning on to log-on screen, another minute to full use after logging in (of course this can vary if you have a lot of programs starting at log-in).\n\nWould definitely recommend to others."}

I can't get over how fast it is - we can stream high definition videos effortlessly. Organizing files is a snap and it has a clean, intuitive interface. Yes, Windows 8 is a bit different, but you can still go back to the \"old school\" settings with a few clicks. We noticed another review commented negatively on the graphics card. The manufacturer responded by stating there were options that could be tweaked so we'll look into that to make our teens gaming experience better. (He doesn't know the difference at this point). Keep in mind this is still a great deal and very easy to customize if you want something with more punch."}

I find myself accidentally hitting the power button far to frequently it doesn't take much either. The smallest bit of pressure onto the button will make it shut off and the power button is fairly large which doesn't help the problem.\n\nThe small fan in my computer was not sized properly so when I turned the computer on the first time it was extremely loud because the fan was rubbing on it's casing which in turn caused one of the fan blades to break. After slightly squeezing the box it became quiet though. Also the computer came with a bag of black stick things. I have no idea what they are for and I can't locate them in the instructions either. My other issue is that I paid $17.99 for premium shipping. I have amazon prime so I could have gotten the shipping for free. Now I was willing to pay extra to get my computer a day earlier but lo and behold it arrives the same day that I could have got the shipping for free. So I'm out an extra $17.99 for nothing."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00GFG1B1A", "review": "I've owned a CybertronPC Borg-Q for about three weeks, and I can honestly say it is a great gaming computer. I was extremely nervous at first, because I don't know much about gaming PCs, and I had been seeking advice on the best kinds of PCs available for gaming. However, most recommendations were outside of my price range. The Asus brand was perhaps the number one recommendation I received, and I seriously thought about getting one, but I wanted something less pricey. I also wanted to get something I could modify in the future since many people recommended PCs where you could replace parts to get a better gaming experience. Of course, Asus was still highly recommended in this regard, but I didn't want to pay a lot of money just to replace parts again in the future.\n\nI eventually learned about the CybertronPC when I did a search on Amazon. I was impressed by the good reviews. I was able to setup the computer without much help, and Windows 8 seems decent as well. I've never used this version of Windows, but I've learned how to navigate the system, and it works okay for me (although I definitely prefer Windows 7). I've been able to get smooth game-play with the graphics and memory cards installed in the computer.\n\nI was not altogether satisfied with the Norton security program provided with the package, but I have a security program I like now, (Kaspersky), and it works just fine. I'm not sure if many people use Kaspersky for computers meant for gaming, but the program has settings that allow you to operate computer safety while playing games at the same time. I highly recommend them. Norton Anti-Virus does pretty much the same thing, but I've used it in the past, and the ads are a tad excessive. If you want a free security program, Norton certainly is a good option, but you can get equally good Anti-Virus programs like Kaspersky without the ads.\n\nAltogether, I am very happy with the great gaming experiences I've had so far using this PC. I plan on updating the graphics card in the future to run games like Battlefield 3 and GTA, but I think the pre-installed hardware should satisfy most people's needs. CybertronPC, thank you!"}

I've called twice now with fairly technical questions, once for pinout details on the PS/2 port, once for a problem booting a live DVD, and have gotten quality answers after a short hold on both occasions.  I also encountered something that in my experience is unprecedented in tech support -- they admitted they made a mistake.  In re the live DVD issue, it turns out the (BIOS setup) boot order for (at least some of) these PCs begins with \"CDROM\", but in fact the optical drive is a cryptic \"Port:1-HL-DT-ST\" entry.  Easy fix.  But what wowed me is the tech owned up to the fact that they'd just plain gotten the boot order wrong when they'd shipped my PCs; he didn't try to make any excuses.  That pretty much assures my future business, and in fact I expect to order a third unit (as soon as I've verified I can get Debian running dual-boot with support for the Nvidia card)\n\nJun 18, 2015 update...

Although, there were a couple of times that i've accidentally turned it off trying to pull my headphones or flashdrive out.

The Nvidia GTX 610 is a mediocre card by today's standards. Unfortunately, most games you have to turn the graphics down quite a bit. It only gets about 20-30 fps on medium settings on Starcraft II. However, I just replaced the card with a EVGA Nvidia GTX 750 Ti and holy s***. Starcraft II gets 80-120 fps on ultra settings! Every other game I've played on high/ultra settings is getting a solid 60 fps or higher! The card is also close to the same dimensions as the 610 so it fit perfectly.

Absolutely ZERO PROBLEMS with the unit. Have a nice 24 inch ViewSonic monitor with it, an HDMI video splitter connected to both the monitor and my HDMI LG big screen TV. Also have a very nice Logitech sound system hooked in to it. Wow! Video feeds through wireless to the PC come through crisp, fast, very clear to the TV. Processing power is everything I need and I am a heavy user at times. Sound is clean and loud. Everything we need. Storage is decent but will upgrade that one later for the thousands of pics the family takes. Wonderful product!"}

The speed of the system is sufficient for my tasks and plenty of space for expansion. The only thing that I do not like much is the fan noise, but my desktop system is seating about two feet away from me and the fan is almost at the same level of my ears when I am seating on my desk chair.\nThe free shipment was good, but it arrived two days later than what I was expecting. It was very well packed with sufficient protection and it included printed installation materials, documentation, and CDs with OS (Windows 8.1) and drivers. System started fine initially and two days later ran into some issues with Windows 8.1 not passing the initial screen. I called CybertonPC support and it was an unexpected experience to speak directly to a human person after 10 minutes waiting. It was worth it the wait and the call. They were very attentive, patience, and technically savvy. They had to send me a CD with the OS image since the one that came with my system did not work, but the other CDs were fine. They did a follow up via email about the shipment with a named person email from CybertronPC and not an alias as other companies usually do. After booting with the new CD and working on the issues, the system allowed me to log me in and enjoy my purchase.\nThey provide quality support services as well as well manufactured PCs. Bottom line... I will definitely buy again a system from them and I hope that they continue with their current support practices. Kudos to their support team!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00GFG1B1A", "review": "My primary reason for purchase was to have a safe data center for newer Microsoft Office operations for school, however, I was also shooting for the ability to play all of the amazing MMO games I missed, because they were just out of the reach of my last system's hardware. This system runs SWTOR, all Arc games like Neverwinter Nights, World of Warcraft.... it runs them all without any problems. I sometimes turn it to medium or high graphic settings in high population areas, but I generally stick to very high or even ultra. There are some delays, as this is not a top of the line system, but I have a PS4 for high graphic games. My fan is quiet, it came with hardly any software, which is awesome. I will be buying all of my PCs through Cybertron for as long as they are making them."}

The only thing is if you're one of those people who like to stream your gameplay you'll definitely have to upgrade some parts in order to have a consistent stream with good quality. So for the price of the PC and the fact that it comes with a keyboard and mouse already I would definitely recommend it for someone who is looking for a good starter computer on a budget and fact that it has extra slots available to install more ram, a wireless card(which it does not come with already), or any other quick upgrade is also a plus."}

However, the GT 610 can get the job done on lower settings. I bought this computer about a year and a half ago and so far am very pleased.\nPros: Plenty of air flow, Windows 8.1 (is not that bad), 8GB RAM, and plenty of room for expansion (since I bought it I've upgraded the Processor, Power supply, MOBO, and Graphics Card it helped me get a platform for making it a PC)\nCons: I won't lie, gaming was not very good for the most part unless you enjoy 20-30 fps.\nNot really a con, but it can be a little loud.\n\nOther Thoughts: I'm really glad I got this pc, because even though it's hardware isn't the best it could handle most things.

I recommend getting this computer to anyone who needs a good gaming pc with upgradable options. Two things I want you to know is that it doesn't have wifi so just buy an ethernet cord, and its a very large pc, allow space for it! Its a little loud but thats okay once you start playing you don't notice the noise.

Took just a few minutes to set up and about another 20 to download anti-virus software, browser, and a few other programs i use regularly. Sadly windows 8 dosn't support my magic jack so back to the old computer with it. The machine itself is whisper quiet and has lots of extra space inside for expansion. tech support was great and patient, told me exactly what i did wrong and got it fixed quickly.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00GFG1B1A", "review": "I love it! I've always been familiar with computers but I haven't owned a desktop for several years and I bought this one just to get into PC gaming, mainly to play Elite: Dangerous and may I say it has more than met my expectations. It had no problem running the game on medium graphics but I wanted more! I had never done any upgrades on a PC before but I was determined to take it on. So after watching some videos on YouTube I was able to upgrade the graphics card, add memory and a couple fans. I added a GTX 750ti FTW edition wich is AMAZING and the power supply is plenty big enough for it. I added another 8gb ram memory card (it now has 16gb) and a couple of corsair 120mm fans with white led's that plugged right into the mother board. I am by no means a computer geek but i have always been a tech guy and this is hands down the fastest computer I have ever used, but I haven't used alot of PC's just ur basic cheap dell's and hp's. If your thinking about buying this PC then I would say get it, the system is great and CYBERTRON is very very helpful.\n\nUPDATE: Just wanted to let everyone know that this beast is still running great! I've learned more about pc's this past year than i did my entire life. So after I upgraded the gpu when I got the pc I haven't really done much else... Until recently when I started looking at more powerful graphics cards. I realized that they require more power and usually atleast an 8pin connector but some require a 8pin and a 6pin. So this past week I upgraded to a modular power supply a EVGA NEX650 80+gold. I was a little intimidated by installing it but Cyberton had done some amazing cable management in there so i was able to just follow everything they had already connected. I also filled the rest of my fan slots creating a positive pressure enviroment for my case because i have a lot of dust in my house and a dog that dosent help. Now I have also been looking into overckocking the cpu, from what i've read online the FX4130 quad core that comes in this unit is a nice little processor that u can get a little extra out of but it would be best to get an aftermarket heatsink and cooler, so today I ordered the Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO. It's a inexpensive cooler that performs very well and with it I ordered a touchscreen LCD fan controller that will hopwfully fit right into the extra bay. When I get everything installed I'll post some new pics. All in all its a great computer and I've had a lot of fun learning and working on it. It's never given me any problems, So thank you Cybertron."}

I'm not a fan of Windows 8.1 but after a couple of hours I warmed up to it. I recommend when setting up you turn off all the extra features to keep the system running even faster, also make sure to go through settings and change the settings to adjust system for best performance. This will ensure your system runs even smoother. If your not sure how to do this search in in Google or whatever search engine you prefer. I also recommend you buy Malwarebytes ad the adblock ad on for google chrome. This will ensure your system stays clear from malware and targeted ads, that can bog your system down. The great thing about this system is you can ad another 8 GB pc-12800 1600 MT/s ram and give the system 16GB ram. This computer allows for future expansion, like the processor and memory. Plenty of open bays available and pretty neat wiring in the case allowing for free air flow, you can also add three more case fans if you want to improve air flow. Lastly the video card is not bad it plays most games, I would not play at the highest settings but with normal settings its not bad.

After a few days of use, speed and performance are wicked fast.  A game that would take a minute or two to launch now launches in seconds.  The design is pretty cool with the red lights.\n\nWe did look at building a comparable PC for him - but he got way more bang for his buck with this package.  We could have easily spent $100+ more and not had as nice of a PC.  He's only had it a few days but it appears to be of good quality and is very good for gaming"}

Maybe, but lets see, hard drive was laying on the bottom, no mount, no screws inside case.  Ok, so correct this issue and proceed to remove my old Desktop, plug in this Borg-Q and download World of Warcraft.  After a night of downloading 28GB of data, I log in to play... on 'Good' graphics setting, I get a whopping 24fps.  Ok, weird, what is the deal? discovered that this motherboard has only two RAM slots, with one taken up with a Patriot 8GB Memory Card.  So, firstly I am shocked because I was expecting this PC to be upgradeable to 32GB of RAM like most alllllll of the other people writing reviews state.  Knowing this motherboard (760GMA-P34(FX)) only has a RAM limit of 16GB, I feel somewhat cheated. Anywho, trying to make things better, I took my old NVidia 9800GT 1GB GPU out of my old Dell 720 XPS and that doubled my fps to 54 on 'Good'  (if I went to 'Fair' or 'Low', then I am up to 90-100fps).  Still though, I have spent no extra money yet and a much better frame rate over the NVidia GT610 that this PC came with.  Still, I feel like I did not get my money's worth ($559) with only a $45 motherboard, $60 GPU, $120 in other parts and a fancy LED light fan. Not to mention, two days after I hook up this PC, this exact unit in blue is going for $500.  Why don't they clearly list the parts used in this setup?  It's because this is America, and we like to take money and hand the other person a polished terd....  I will update this review with pictures after contacting customer service to demand the $123 motherboard (GA-78LMT-USB3) that is upgradeable to 32GB of RAM.  Even if the reviewers who state they could upgrade to 32GB of RAM but actually couldn't, I would expect the same customer service rep who comments on everyone else's review to set them straight if it were not actually true."}

Lightning fast, can multitask, render videos, and plays the two games I wanted it to most right out of the box, Skyrim & Minecraft. Both with solid 60fps. Couldn't be happier with my purchase. Will probably upgrade the GPU sometime in the future. My only complaint is that the window mounted fan is very loud. Nothing is obstructing the fan, it just runs loud.\n\nEDIT 11/3/16: I've had this machine since February of 2015. A couple weeks ago I had issues with random shutdowns when launching the game Blade & Soul. I did some research and found out it was the AMD FX 4130 CPU overheating. After more research, I bought a 20 gram tube of Arctic MX-4 thermal compound to replace the old paste on the CPU. When I took the heatsink off, the old paste was all dried up. I used 99% ISO rubbing alcohol & a lint free microfiber cloth to clean off all the old paste on both the CPU & heatsink, then applied the MX-4 TIM using the pea method. My idle temps dropped from 80 C to 50 C but I believe that's still about 20 C too high for idle. Next I used some dust off compressed air and made sure there were no dust bunnies or anything obstructing the CPU fan & heatsink. My idle temps are still around 50 C which is too high. With just google chrome open to post this, I'm running at 63 C and am afraid to do any video editing or play any games, I would like to avoid any damage to the socket or mobo.\n\nWhat other options do I have to fix this issue? Next I was going to order the cooler master 212 and see if that changes anything."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00GFG1B1A", "review": "I needed a new computer.  My old one was slowing down (and still running Vista, for that matter).  I needed a machine for word-processing, web-browsing, occasional gaming, and lots of Netflix-streaming.\n\nThe price tag on this one appealed to me, so I ordered it.  It's been serving my needs quite well for the most part.  With more RAM and a faster processor than my previous PC, video streaming is much better.  I can stream in full 1080P HD without any lag.  Once I accidentally pulled the Ethernet cable out of my router while I was streaming and the video kept playing for several minutes--that's some pretty good buffering if you ask me.\n\nThe only problem I have had is that sometimes when I run the Netflix app, at the end of a video I get the blue screen of death and the computer restarts.  I contacted Cybertron and the technician told me it's a problem with the app.  Since the problem only occurs while using Netflix and since a web search revealed that others have had similar problems with Netflix, I'm mostly convinced that this is, in fact, a Netflix problem and not a PC problem.  I'm hoping an update of the Netflix app will clear this up for me.\n\nI have upgraded to a better GPU, which boosted the video performance (especially for gaming).  I would recommend that others do the same.  I'm also glad the RAM is upgradable to 32G.  Since I don't do any serious editing of pictures, video, or sound, the original 8G have been enough for me.  I'll probably upgrade eventually anyway though--at least to 24G.\n\nIn short, this is a very decent setup and upgradable if you need more memory and/or storage."}

As far as I can tell that option is not available at Amazon or I would have ordered it here.  I loaded Kubuntu 14.04 Linux on it with absolutely no problems.  I also installed my ST Audio C-Port 2000 pro audio card in the single PCI slot and added 3 SATA disk drives to the system.  I've been building (and tearing down and fixing) PCs for the last 20 years where I work and this is one of the easiest systems to work on that I've ever encountered.  I have read some reviews complaining about excess noise from the system fans.  I added a side fan and even with that it is fairly quiet.  All onboard hardware works as advertised.  I'm not a gamer but I do record multitrack audio, I do some video editing, and I write and test my own 2D and 3D scientific data editing software.  This system is plenty fast.  The only Linux hiccup that I encountered was due to my use of the add-on audio card.  I had to disable the onboard audio in the BIOS, disable pulseaudio (sudo chmod -x /usr/bin/pulseaudio), and then blacklist the HDMI audio from the NVIDIA graphics card (search for \"Disabling NVIDIA's HDMI Audio Under Linux\").  I'm extremely pleased with the system and definitely happy with the price."}

Nothing in this computer feels cheap, it is all sturdy and very futuristic looking. When it arrived we (My girlfriend and I bought it together) were so excited to see the massive box, and inside everything was well packaged, with all the manuals in their own weather proof bag. Unboxing and setting up the PC was an absolute breeze, and unlike many I actually like Windows 8.1, though the lack of wireless meant we had to wait for our wireless adapter, though that was no fault of this PC.\n\nOnce the wireless adapter showed up it was a breeze to install, as unlike some other high end systems I could mention the Cybertron people actually installed a disk drive. After downloading a bunch of games overnight I decided to test them, and because of the Graphics card they did not play so well. Neither Star Trek Online nor Star Wars: The Old Republic could get above minimum, though both had a nice high framerate. It also plays Europa Universalis IV and Crusader Kings II perfectly even at the highest settings (Not saying too much), and could play Total War: Shogun 2 at medium-high settings.\n\nThe only shortfall I could say about this PC is that my windows code on the side of the box didn't work, so I keep getting it asking me to verify every day. It also had the manual for the Striker II system, which was odd...\n\nOverall 9/10, graphics card is easy to replace"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00GFG1B1A", "review": "(PLEASE READ TO THE BOTTOM FOR UPDATES)\n\nI just received this computer early today. Up until an hour ago I was very happy. However, once I got around to installing and plugging in my gaming headset ( a Razer Kraken 7.1) I realized that there has to be some kind of wire crossing happening because using any usb headset (I tried with several different styles and brands in every usb port on this tower as well as using a hub) causes my gaming keyboard and mouse to stop working. I cannot game with this computer because my headset renders my keyboard controls and mouse unusable.  Not just in game, either, it happens when watching a youtube video or netflix as well. Unless I'm using an old fashioned audio jack headset, I cannot have headphones in if I want to do anything.  As you can expect, this renders my ability to game pretty much null, since I game almost exclusively with headphones, very rarely without.\n\nAs it is the weekend, I am going to reserve a final judgement until I've spoken with Cybertron's customer support on Monday, and will come back and edit this review with the results - whether they can fix it or not. If they can, I will raise the rating, otherwise I'll be returning this computer, unfortunately.\n\nETA:  1/19/15 - Things have gotten worse. The USB ports don't just not function, they also fry components. One of the front USB ports fried and corrupted my external hard drive as I attempted to move data from my old destop to this one, which is now going to cost me a hundred bucks for the software to recover my files and another hundred bucks to replace the external. So a 550 dollar computer is now up to costing me over 700 bucks. Wonder how much more money it'll cost me before all is said and done. Still waiting to hear back from customer support from Cybertron... *jeopardy music plays*\n\nETA: 1/21/15 - Another update. I've been working all afternoon today with Cybertron's tech support, specifically a very nice guy named Blake, and it's been very promising! Blake was able to recover all my data off my corrupted hard drive - which it turns out probably wasn't even caused by the PC so he didn't have to help me at all but did and I am incredibly grateful as I am an author and everything I've ever written was on that drive.  I'll be working with him again tomorrow to try and fix the USB headset/keyboard/mouse issue and after all his help today I'm very hopeful that he'll be able to get everything working properly and I can go back to loving my computer again. I am, however, holding off on changing the rating yet, because my main issue is still not fixed so until then my negative review stands. A 5 star review for Blake and his tech support so far, though.\n\nETA: 1/21/15 again - Well, I am upgrading my rating to four stars. Cybertron tech support was not only able to recover all my lost data, Blake the tech guy I worked with quickly diagnosed and fixed the issue with the USB headphones interfering with my keyboard. It's all fixed, I'm back to blowing things up in my games and I now give this computer 4 stars. The lack of the fifth star is directly related to the cheap, basically useless graphics card in it, but no big deal, I planned to upgrade anyway. Which, by the way, tech support also helped me figure out exactly which is the best card I can upgrade to without having to upgrade my power supply just yet. I'm sure eventually I will upgrade the power supply and get a GTX 980 or the like in there, but for now a mid-level card will do and I'm just really grateful the issues I had got fixed so I don't have to return this. Amazing customer service, ignore anything you read elsewhere about bad service. They were great."}

They know what they are talking about and will walk you have trouble with. This was the prime reason I bought this PC, the lifetime support was crucial to me.\n\nThe computer specs are near perfect for me. 1TB HDD is more than enough. The case matches wonderfully with my Razer peripherals. But the one thing I will need to replace is the graphics card. I could only run skyrim at ultra around 8fps, Obviously unplayable, and The Evil Within was too slow even at the lowest settings. All in all, the computer is smooth, fast, and sleek, with the exception of the GPU. I would recommend the gtx 750ti because of value, low noise, low power and obviously the gaming performance."}

But yea, so far I love it, super good price even comparing to building your own. Oh, Windows 8 is not TOO bad, it takes getting used to but it runs pretty clean. Not loaded with useless power draining programs. Room for plenty of upgrades, computer is fairly light, good looking, starts up VERY fast. I highly doubt I will ever buy a different brand of computer again if this thing holds up. I mean, look at all the good reviews, they're doing something right!"}

If you're a hard core gamer, you'll need more and better, but for the other 99%, it leaves nothing to be desired. My kids play Minecraft, and they are thrilled with this machine as-is. For web surfing, email, editing photos or watching movies, this is a great machine. There is plenty of memory (8 gig), and plenty of storage at 1 terabyte.  The graphics card, admittedly an entry level one, is still more than sufficient for most people. The box is big, leaving ample room for future upgrades, if that's your thing.  There is no built-in WiFi, but that's an easy fix with more than one solution.\n\nCons:  The only negative I have is that the fan is a little loud.

It probably could use a faster graphics card but is fine for beginners like myself. I would recommend this computer for anyone who is just starting out or just needs something faster and more reliable. I replaced a four year old HP with this one and very glad I did. Having a computer built like this one, which allows for easy upgrading and modifying, is much better than any of the big name brands. It's quiet for a gaming computer. The computer arrived very quickly(2 days) and was packaged very well. Set up was very easy and didn't come loaded with a bunch of spam programs.

The Borq Q was within my budget at $549 through Amazon.  Placed my order late evening and with Prime expected free 2 day shipping, but I received it the very next day!  Packaged well with large foam blocks supporting each corner.\nAll the connections were good and it fired right up without issue.  Would have prefered Windows 7 but getting used to Windows 8.1.\nThe computer is fast and can run multiple functions at once.  Minecraft plays flawlessly on high settings, but Shadows of Mordor and Skyrim need to run on lowest settings.  This is something we anticipated because of other reviews here on Amazon.  We'll probably upgrade the graphics card in the future but this unit is far superior to the HP laptop he had before.  The only mild complaint from my son has been the fans run a little louder than he would like.  Overall we're very happy."}

I am very relieved that I didn't have to return the PC just picked up a simple adapter that the rep did offer to send, but I have an impatient 10 year old wanting to play some games so I ran out and purchased one.  Problem solved!! The rep even gave a follow up call to make sure all was working.  For anyone having the same issue I highly recommend speaking with them before returning, it is running great.\n\n(Ordered this for our 10 year old for Christmas. We set it up and only the fan comes on. The monitor says no input and keyboard don't work. There were no manuals included, some random pieces in a bag with no clue as to what they are. We tried 3 monitors in all and it won't recognize any of them, yet the fan has no problem running non stop from the moment you hit the power button. We choose this model for the very high reviews and price point. Very disappointed that there is no option to do a replacement because price has jumped and Amazon no longer carries it. Cybertron customer service is an answering machine, I tried reaching out several times and spoke with a receptionist who took my name and number, did I get a call back? Nope.

We're going to be gaming, recording, and live-streaming using this system, and it looks like it has the chops to go the distance.\n\nBasically, for what we paid, we FINALLY got our money's worth, which is EXACTLY what I'm looking for.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00GFG1B1A", "review": "I bought this system largely for gaming, but also to function as my day-to-day system for usual household stuff (bank accounts, email, surfing, etc). I settled on this model largely because of the high ratings, quality feedback, and because of its gaming capabilities (ironically the primary game I wanted to play  Battlefield 2142 - went off the air the day before I fired the PC up, so that was a considerable frustration, but inconsequential to this review), but most importantly because it was deeply discounted leading up to the holidays.\nA few observations Ill try to categorize:\n- Operating system is Windows 8.1. This operates very similarly to a smartphone OS; to download apps, you generally have to go to an app store; the screen seems to be designed for monitors that have touch sensors  I don't have a touch-monitor, but after a week of using the system, it seems perfectly functional without it.\n- Launching programs is a bit different here; you select the Start button at the bottom left, opening a whole app menu. A small down arrow at the bottom left corner opens the program menu. I haven't mastered the whole move the cursor to the right side of the screen and swipe it inward thing.\n- There is no MS Office of any sort on this machine. If its too pricey, Id advise either looking on Craigslist for a disk/key thats been removed from a machine ($20-40), or download Open Office from Cnet.com for free, which functions as MS-compatible software, allowing you to read and edit Word, Excel (et al) documents. I installed Office 2010 Pro and it works seamlessly.\n- Antivirus  I installed Avast, and searched to find what was currently installed on the machine. It said it came with MS Defender (which I have zero experience with), and advised I stick with only one. I retained Avast, and plan to install Malware Bytes momentarily as a supplemental tool, since these two seemed to work effectively on my previous machine.\n- Software updates were straightforward, and its the primary negative experience I encountered with this machine. Shortly after powering up, my goal was to ensure all MS software I had installed was properly patched and updated to avoid getting viruses or malware. I selected to have the system automatically install updates. I got the window that read something like Do not power off  Installing updates, and below that, it read Installing update 4 of 34. That was at about 9am. Throughout the day I checked up on it, and it remained at Installing update 4 of 34. At about 10pm, same thing. I read up on recovery for this; I basically had 2 options:\no Try CNTL+ALT+DEL, as this sometimes snaps the machine back in lineno such luck.\no As option 1 failed, I read that the only option is a hard shut down (not a good sign in my opinion for such a new system). I shut it down, went to bed for the night. Next morning I powered it back up. USB ports appeared to be inoperative, increasing my alarm. I shut it back down, cycled the power toggle in the rear (the O/I switch), then rebooted into Safe Mode with Networking. It seemed to work. I immediately went and continued my Updates, selecting/loading them individually/manually (my discretion, since I was afraid of loading many at once and not knowing which update had failed the system). After completing this, I checked my update history, to see whether anything had been compromised. There appeared to be 3 optional updates that had failed. I researched to see how to recover from this, and unanimously other users advised I disregard them; they're optional and their lack will not compromise the systems effectiveness.\n- After using the system now for about a week, everything appears to be on track. No concerns, no hang-ups aside from the system update. A criticism, again focused at the software, is that the layout is very different and a bit of a hassle to contend with if you're looking to work quickly and are acclimated to Windows 7, but I think thats common when transitioning from one OS to the next. If I had greater experience with a smart phone, I might be more savvy with this system. I wish that MS had created an option to view the menu in the Windows 7 format. Im contemplating researching what my options are in that regard  though I won't be installing Windows 7 itself, as Ive had prior heartache with changing operating systems and contending with device drivers not being available/effective.\n- Ive installed and played Crysis in default mode. Its very smooth, resolution is good, and so is the sound. My next gaming acquisition will likely be Battlefield 4 with the Naval Strike upgrade.\n- On the machine itself, I like that its very upgradeable. Its a bit on the large size, but not grotesquely so. I loved that it came in a padded box within a padded box. I loved how organized everything seemed to be, and that its been made abundantly clear that the customer service for this company is top-notch (I hope I don't have to use itbut its a comfort having that option in my back pocket should I require it) and proactive at customer satisfaction. Ventilation seems pretty effective, but I think Ill add a fan since some of the games I play run rather hot. Over time I might upgrade the graphics card, based on other gamers reviews.\nOverall Im happy, and would recommend this system to other users. Ill give it a month then post again if there are any relevant updates to my experience."}

The keyboard it comes with has keys that aren't really loud when you're typing; They're nice and quiet. Overall this is a great computer that I have no problem recommending HOWEVER, the computer is LOUD. I bought it thinking I could use a new set of speakers when gaming but I was wrong. If you try to play games, watch movies, or do anything with audio WITHOUT using a headset, you'll have to turn the volume up a bit because the fans on the computer are so loud. I use a headset when playing WOW, so it doesn't bother me. If you're thinking of using speakers and not a headset, you'll have a very hard time hearing anything other than the really loud fans!\n\nAlso, the graphics card is on the weak side. It comes shipped with a PCI-E card that would be great for running games on low but if you want to run games on higher settings, I recommend getting a new graphics card. I had to replace the one it came with. Overall however, this is a great computer if you can get over the really loud fan.\n\n**REVIEW UPDATE**\n\nAfter moving a few wires inside the computer around, the tower is still VERY loud. A warning to anyone who is thinking about buying this: While it is a very good and stable computer, it is LOUD. Using it without headphones to block out the noise from the fans is not advisable."}

I wasn't able to call in due to my schedule, but the support team responded promptly and wanted to replace the PC.  In the course of my testing, I was able to determine that the issue was not PC related, but was a problem with Windows Update.

Despite what some other reviews say about a loud fan, the fan in my Borg-Q is quiet. The first game I installed and opened was PAYDAY 2, which runs smoothly at Medium settings, and the sound quality is fantastic. I am immensely pleased with this product so far. The only small problem I've noticed is the audio port on the front. I have my headphones plugged in and if I wiggle the jack gently my audio is distorted slightly and I can hear a static sound. Not sure if this is caused by a faulty audio port or what.

I can hear the fans 30 feet down the hall so you can imagine the sound in the room and next to the computer.

To their credit because it was a brand new computer Cybertron did replace the power supply which was whining constantly and making a high pitched noise that was almost unbearable to my ears, but here we are and it's just May 1st and my computer that I bought just FIVE MONTHS ago now has a hard drive that is apparently failing. I've backed it up and I'm ordering a new one as I type, but it totally TICKS me off that this drive is dying in FIVE MONTHS!!!! I will never buy a Cybertron PC again. Clearly they're using substandard parts or something. There is just no excuse for this, none. One bad part might be a fluke, two is definite a sign that someone is making some really crappy PC's and/or their quality control sucks...\n\nUpdate: It is now August and I've had this computer for nine months, and guess what? I am now replacing a THIRD part. DO NOT make the same mistake I did and buy this PC. Buying this machine was a huge mistake. Cybertron, I could not be more ticked at you right now. This has been a horrible experience, it really has...\n\nOkay, here we go again, another month, another problem. It's Sept and here I am looking at replacing a FIFTH part. The USB slots have apparently decided to be fussy now. I can't even plug in a basic mouse and not have it \"exceed the power capacity\" of the port. Excuse me? I have about had it with this machine. Cybertron this is the worst PC I have ever owned. I'm practically rebuilding it month by month because it has such shoddy parts in it. About all I haven't replaced at this point is the main board and the case. I mean SERIOUSLY what the HECK? I've had this computer for nine months and I've spent most of it replacing defective parts? This is just utter BS. I totally regret buying this machine. I wish now I had got it directly from them because at least I'd have had a decent warranty but I don't know that it would help. At this point I'm half convinced they're building their PC's with knock off parts or something because there is NO excuse for this at this point. My PC looks cool, but that's about it. Heck my Dell was better than this. Severe disappointment doesn't even begin to cover it. I'd take away the one star if I could. This computer does not deserve it. :("}

I've had it for 4 days now and I'm very satisfied. The tower looks good and the blue lights give it a high end rig look. The computer does not have wireless so you will need to buy a wireless adapter if you don't want a wired connection. Not an issue for me since a wired connection is faster anyways. I did have an issue when i first set up the internet though, it was going extremely slow. I couldn't figure it out at first but all I had to do was update and restart the computer. I bought this to play league of legends and I get a solid 60fps on medium-high settings. I haven't tried to put the graphics to maximum yet, so not sure how the fps will hold up.

He was not originally part of the company I ordered from, I ordered my computer off of Newegg.com - It was around $600 for the order, and standard shipping was 4-7. It was shipped on time from newegg.com but upon setting it up, I got 4-5 black screens and then a blue screen, then the computer turned off. I was absolutely bull crap if you know what I'm saying. I compete in 2400+ arenas on World of Warcraft and the season had just started, I ordered the computer to be delivered on that day so I could play after my computer kicked the bucket. I couldn't find ANY support numbers for newegg, the fedex people sucked. That's when I used a live chat feature on the CybertronPC Wichita Website. I was talking to him on live chat for a few minutes, and trust me when I say I wasn't at all pleasant to the staff after that had happened. But he walked me through over 90 minutes of checking all the internal components and running me through other tests on the blue screen. Unfortunately there was something seriously wrong with the hardware, not an issue of an unplugged hard drive etc, so I did have to end up sending it back. Andy upgraded my shipping to 2 day for free, and also sent me a slightly newer edition of the PC. Overall, if your going to order this computer. Get it right from the website on CybertronPC or through amazon. Don't go to anybody else, and a HUGE thanks to Andy Tang, you made my year - I haven't had that good of customer service in ANYTHING (video games, store management etc) until Andy helped me out. This man deserves some serious props and a big promotion. Thanks again man you are the best."}

That said, I contacted CybertronPC help desk via chat and they shipped me a replacement PC pretty quickly and sent me a shipping label to send the current PC back to them free of charge. Happy to report the new PC has no issue.\n\n2. The stock cooler (CPU heatsink and fan) is a bit loud for my taste -- no grinding, more like a jet airplane.

Ever since I powered the system on I've received nothing but errors stating that the memory failed or something other. I have only been able to get past the login screen once, into the actual desktop screen. Every other time the screen sits idle, gives me an error, randomly restarts because a \"problem was found,\" or some other flaw.\n\nCurrently, I'm sitting here waiting for it to log in (which I'm writing this review from a laptop that's next to the desktop, and it's been sitting idle showing that it's trying to log in for a little over 15 minutes.\n\nProblem, after problem, after problem. With the last two hours of my life I've wasted trying to get this thing up and running, I'm contemplating just returning it and going with another brand. I would not recommend this product to another person if this is a known common occurrence."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00GFG1B1A", "review": "I purchased this computer as my first gaming desktop a few months ago. The graphics card is pretty low end, so it requires low-medium settings on most games, and I even have trouble with Minecraft periodically. But when it comes down to it, this computer is a gem for someone who wants to upgrade their computer, but not build it. It's got a spacious interior and some quality parts to start with, and definitely runs for the time being. Four months later, I've had absolutely no problems and now considering the EVGA GTX 750 Ti. If you are a serious gamer looking for immediate high-end performance, this isn't the setup for you. But if you're patient and willing to learn, this is an ideal 1st gaming desktop.\nEDIT: I've just installed the EVGA gtx 750Ti 2GB, and all I have to say is wow. I was expecting a need to upgrade my power supply and processor at some point, but with a good video card in place of that trash 610, this thing is a beast. Skyrim, Assassin's Creed II, Fallout 3, Minecraft are all thrashed at 60 FPS with ultra-high settings. The hardware and software installation is quick and easy for anyone who doesn't know a lick about computers, just make sure to uninstall the drivers for the 610 card first (easy to find out online) and you're ready to go. I bought this machine for $600 a few months ago, upgraded it with the video card for another $130, and it now performs on par with my buddy's $1500 rig. 5 stars if you're willing to shell out the extra cash for the better video card, you won't be disappointed.\n2nd EDIT: Over 6 months later, still loving this computer. I use it every day for many hours and have had no issues. Very pleased.\n3rd EDIT: 1 year and 6 months later, I still adore this computer. I've used it every day and have just about used up half of the hard drive with all kinds of games, documents and what have you. I will say that the computer is beginning to show signs of wear: start-up is quick and clear but as soon as the desktop shows, it needs an extra minute to compose itself before I can jump right in to word, chrome or anything for that matter. A whirring sound has started to come from the tower and has only gotten worse with time. I'm not sure if it's because I'm standing it up on carpet or something, but I've stuck a sock underneath to level it off and that stops the whirring altogether. This computer is also beginning to feel the effects of newer games, Fallout 4 on Ultra High settings put it in its place at 25fps with frequent lag spikes, but High settings fell in line. Ultra-modded Skyrim gives it a challenge on Ultra High, but High shows it who is boss. When I got this computer I considered upgrading the processor, but since then, this computer has continued to impress and won't need an upgrade for quite a while, The fact is that this computer was, is, and will be a great gaming desktop for the price as long as you upgrade the video card.\n4th EDIT: Well, the time has come. Almost a full two years later, and it's time to upgrade. I was more than happy with this computer and would have willingly kept it, but I got a good deal on a new one. I have since sold it to my brother as his first gaming PC, and he's more than impressed. Still a great budget rig two years later!"}

Computer ran most processes great, as well as responsive. The GPU was the thing slowing the computer down. After removing it and installing a NVidia EVGA 760, this thing runs great. I changed the PSU too (750M Corsair). I had to move the fan on the viewing part of the tower a fan slot higher to accompany for the bigger GPU (the PCI-E cords were close to the fan. really close). Now it runs great. The CPU is plenty powerful as well as a solid Mobo (although it might be my next upgrade depending on how long it lasts) and after adding an Intel SSD, its just even better. I know it seems like I had to put a lot into this to get it up to par, but now I run almost everything on high-ultra high and only hitting a max of 55C on the temp. I can run most on full, but I want to wait til I get a monitor to really stress the system. I might get another small fan to mount on the back of the tower just to increase air flow.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00GFG1B1A", "review": "The cons first: One side (the blue that you see) is made out of a light weight plastic. Now given that fact, a desktop PC isn't designed to be toted around. The plastic side has slits to help disperse heat (I assume). In a sense they are delicate and could be damaged by a child--the led bright blue lighting is attracting to anyone.\n\nPutting that aside, this machine is solidly built. All wires are neatly tied/bundled together and are out of the way. The casing is large enough to easily service the unit - if you need to replace a fan or just add more DDR3 memory etc. Another plus is that a mere two screws take off side and it comes off very easily.\n UPDATE 4/28/15\n\nUnfortunately, this particular machine has been routinely crashing. Customer service with cybertron is quite good - they are located in the USA and I have never waited for more than 1 minute to get to technical support. After its most recent crash, cybertron technical support felt that there was a hardware problem with the machine. They immediately mailed me a shipping label and I forwarded the unit back for repair. I do not have the machine back yet. At this point, I am still believe they make fine PC's. Its my honest belief that I happened to \"get a dud.\"  If the problem is fixed (and stays that way) I might just up them to 5 stars. If I receive a problematic machine back, I will gladly warn my fellow Amazonians of my then ongoing troubles. My advice: cybertron stands behind they're products - anyone can get a malfunctioning machine at any price point. With that being said, I wouldn't let my situation stop from making your purchase.\n\nIf you plan on using a computer hutch, make certain that this unit will fit. It is larger than the average pc you will find in the big box stores.\n\nI cannot comment on its speed regarding gaming - I am not a gamer. I purchased this unit based upon its price and components.\n\nFor the first 2 or 3 weeks I had this machine, I was having all kinds of issues--some seemed to be hardware based - other software based. The problem(s) had nothing to do with my unit. I had too many USB devices plugged into the PC that require power. With that being said all kinds quirky things were occurring - the solution was to add a powered hub to the PC and now it runs flawlessly.\n\nI haven't had to contact customer service with any problems - its one of first units I have purchased in a while that was issue free out of the box.\n\nSo why only four stars? The led blue lighting is so bright - you can't leave it on at night in a bedroom. I would have also preferred a more sturdy plastic wall with slits.\n\nMy last suggestion is if you do wish to put this unit in a bedroom/sleeping area, I would recommend getting the red unit. \"Blue\" lightens up in the dark far more than the color red - which is no secret as to why most alarm clocks have red illuminated numbering.\n\nI purchased the unit for $589 in 11/14 and now its listed for $559- its a steal for that price...."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00GFG1B1A", "review": "I've been using this desktop for about a week now, and I'm thoroughly pleased. I did a lot of shopping around on Amazon, and for my price point (below $600), this PC is a great value. It runs incredibly smooth, and can handle pretty intensive programs well. The inside looks great, and runs pretty quietly.\n\nPros:\n8 GB of ram\n3.8 GHz quadcore processor rocks\n1 TB hard drive, a pretty decent amount of space.\nWindows 8.1, which I was dubious of at first, but have thus far actually come to appreciate.\nA good amount of space for expansion, and a clean interior\nEnough USB ports!\n\nCons:\nThe keyboard and mouse that come with this are pretty basic. That's a easy/cheap fix though, and they are functional.\nThe graphics card is just alright, especially in comparison to the rest of the machine. I knew this when I bought  it (they're not at all misleading about what it is), and plan to upgrade soon.\n\nCurrently the PC can handle games like Borderlands 2, Skyrim and Divinity: Original Sin, but I had to lower most settings and play at lower resolution to get a good fps. All in all, I find the Borg-Q to be a pretty solid machine. It seems generally on-par or a bit ahead of my roommate's ~$700 iBuyPower PC in every aspect besides the graphics card. Definitely worth the money."}

Needed something on the inexpensive side, but with enough power to handle a couple of games, at least with average graphics and frames per second. Unfortunately, everything now-a-days either has integrated graphics or is too expensive to even consider. Was pleasantly surprised by this machine. It looks beyond cool, runs quiet and has the least amount of bloatware I have ever seen in a computer. Even comes with its own Windows 8.1 restore disk (do you have any idea how hard it is to find one now-a-days???) AND a sticker with the serial number (for other computers, it's so buried so deep, that you need a third party software to find it). Has plenty of room for upgrades and is also one of the lightest desktops that I have ever seen. Strongly recommend this computer to everyone."}

The packaging was superbly done up with lots of extra protection to make sure there where no accidents along the way.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00GFG1B1A", "review": "Having seen the generally good reviews, I was interested in a computer from this company, but there were things I wanted to change. Fortunately, going to their site gave me the option to have a system built to my specs. I didn't need or want an optical drive (had two perfectly working ones here), generic keyboard/mouse, or Windows 8 as I had access to Win 7 though a local university. On the other hand, I definitely wanted a heftier power supply (650w) and a better graphics card (Nvidia 650). None of that was a problem. I'd have been happy to get a less blingy case, but that wasn't an option. One thing I did appreciate was that all the components used were name brand with the model number and manufacturer given so getting online documentation and updated drivers is not an issue.\n\nWhen the system was delivered, the first thing I noted was the case was far sturdier than it appears in these photos. It uses screwless drive rails for everything so installing the drives from my old system was extremely easy. The other thing about this case is that both sides are removable. There is plenty of space below the motherboard mounting plate to route cables and that's how it had been done. Boy had it. All cables in cable sheathing and cable tied to the plate. Running the cables I had to for the drives I installed was simple and I tried to be as neat with mine (minus the mesh cable sheathing which I didn't have). This means no cables running on the component side of the motherboard to block airflow. Speaking of airflow, there's mounting points for 9 fans if I count right should you feel the need for that. I guess my only real con is that the front panel feels a little sparse. There are just two USB ports and the mic and headphone connectors. A couple more USB ports would have been handy. I may look into a memory card reader to make getting images from my camera a bit easier. Oh, while it wasn't an issue for me since I did my own OS installation, they list the software they'd usually install, and you can request they don't. Most of the packages are popular open source packages that are well worth having installed. I ended up installing most of them since most were tools I'd been using already.\n\nYes, I could probably have sourced the parts myself and put a similar system together from scratch and maybe saved a little. On the other hand, the time involved waiting for everything to arrive, then go through all the documentation, then assemble it hoping I didn't mess something up or that none of the parts I put in were DOA just wasn't worth it.\n\nAfter running it for a month, I'm still absolutely thrilled with it. It runs everything I want to run very well. The updated graphics card certainly has made the gaming I do much more enjoyable."}

He saved up his own money and we were very torn between this and the Syber gaming system coming out in October. My son was way too impatient and so we went ahead and bought this. In the picture I was worried that the blue cover on the left side was going to be a solid color plastic and thus making it look toyish. I was pleasantly surprised and the crystal clear bright blue plastic that is very appealing whether it's lit up or not. It reminds me of a transformer and it is in the way that you can change up or add parts to your hearts content. It's beautiful inside and I'm not even into computers. I really wanted my son to learn how to build onto it himself as a learning experience and this is going to be fun. We already purchased a Evga Geforce 750ti to give the graphics a boost. Can't wait until it arrives. It's running smooth as silk and we are very happy with this purchase. You can tell that they are listening to reviewers and focusing on a better customer experience.

I finally had to take advantage of the Square Trade warranty I purchased after months of run-around from Cybertron that there was nothing wrong with my PC, or it must be *my* fault because it was getting too hot, or I had it plugged into the wrong kind of power strip, or that *both* of my hard drives must have failed simultaneously, all on their own, and it had nothing to do with the PC. It just shut off, over and over, for no reason. They couldn't find anything wrong with it, even though they had it for 3 weeks. Well Square Trade put in a new motherboard and new power supply a couple months ago at a cost of $23 to me. Guest what? It works PERFECTLY and has never once shut down again. Nothing wrong with it? Baloney. I'll never buy from Cybertron again.\n\n****UPDATE 09/09/2014**** Fantastic customer service from Cybertron. Within 24 hours of posting the below review, I received feedback here on Amazon from the company. Then, a short time later, I get an email from a customer service rep who wants to speak to me about the issues I noted with the unit in my review. He called me at home in the evening since I said I worked all day; he was friendly and helpful, and although shipping damage isn't exactly their fault, he wanted to make it right. They are shipping me some free spare SATA cables and assured me if anything at all was an issue with the system moving forward, they'd ship me a whole new unit. I am VERY impressed with this level of customer service, and now even happier that I made this purchase. Thanks Cybertron!\n\n***Original Review***\nI ordered this with some trepidation, since it's a fair amount of money to spend on something I couldn't even look at or test out and I was not familiar with the brand. However, after reading many positive reviews on various sites, I took a chance. I am glad that I did, my initial impression is favorable, and it worked pretty much right out of the box. I'm not a serious gamer, so the graphic card is just fine with me.\n\nPro: My favorite thing is that it came with NO bloatware, adware, trialware, or crapware. Windows 8, VLC Media Player for playing DVD's and that was all. Nothing else, awesome! No burned in crap clogging up the hard drive and registry that I need to seek out and remove. I was able to immediately load in 2 additional hard drives, a second optical drive, and add 8 Gigs more RAM without a hitch.\nCon:\nThere were a couple of loose screws and one small nut rattling around in the case. I was able to track them down and replace where they came from. Also, one of the SATA cable clips was broken, and the cable was falling off the HDD. However, I have several spares and was able to switch it out. Not worth returning it for that. If you're not at least a little computer savvy, this might be tricker or cost you a few bucks.\n\nOverall:I may revisit this later but for now, it's all good."}

I badly needed an upgrade, and after doing some research, bought this one based on the positive reviews. Unfortunately, the machine I received was dead on arrival, I hooked it up, turned it on and there was no monitor output. I contacted CybertronPC's customer support about this and they wasted no time shipping a replacement. I've been extremely happy with it ever since.\n\nAfter unpacking it, I took off the side panel to get a better look and all the wires were neatly tied together and everything was solidly in place. It looks like there's a lot of room to upgrade parts. The case is large and well ventilated, the fan on the side is a little loud, but I wear headphones and don't notice it, and the green lighting is awesome in a darker room. The keyboard and mouse that ship with it are nothing special, but comfortable to use.\n\nThe games I've been running on this are Skyrim, Oblivion, Elder Scrolls Online, Minecraft, Portal, Assassin's Creed I and II, and have had great performance with all, even recording a little with Fraps. I have Skyrim running on medium settings, with quite a few mods, it looks and runs great. In addition to games, I also do some digital painting with Photoshop and apart from some brush lag with large sized brushes, (I make a line and it takes a second to appear) I have no complaints. This computer runs at light speed compared to my old Dell.\n\nThe only problems I've encountered have been getting used to Windows 8 after being used to a much older operating system. The OS was designed exclusively for touch devices, but after playing around and figuring out how to turn off certain features, I'm ok with it.\n\nOverall, a great computer for the price. I'm very happy with mine."}

I decided on this \"CybertronPC Borg Q\" because of the 41/2 star rating and really good reviews and i am so happy i did, because this gaming pc is a monster for low to mid pc gaming, it knocks the games i play out of the water and i did not realize my games could look so beautiful and fast, i already had a 42\" 1080P full high definition flat panel tv with HDMI ports on it and i also brought another one of Amazons excellent HDMI cables 9\" in length. I don`t play games like Call of Duty, Battlefield series or none of the graphics intensive first person shooters (i don`t like first person POV), so this pc is perfect for me, even tho some people in the reviews said they could run these games on low settings and the games look fine, i don`t know. This pc is fast in everything it does and it does it well, video rendering, downloads (if you have good internet service) surfing on the net, burning cd`s and dvd`s at 16X speed and of course gaming (with my last pc i would give my military in EU4, Crusaders Kings II or Civ5 orders to move and it would take up to  20 to 25 seconds to respond), with this pc it is instant and the graphics are just beautiful and life like, it`s like playing these games for the first time and i can play games that would not run on my old pc, like Sim City 5 and Rome II on mid to high settings. For $589.00, this is a very, very good gaming computer, it came with a AMD FX Quad Core processor with 3.80 to turbo charged 3.90ghz speed, 1TB HDD for tons of games, music, videos and photos, 8 gigs Of DDR3 Ram (upgradable to 32 gigs), Windows 8.1, i was afraid of this OP, but now \"I LOVE IT\" because it is lighter, faster and use less system resources than all the other versions, it took about an hour and i was hooked, it has a Nvidia GeForce GTX 610 1GB video card, i may replace it with a Nvidia GeForce GTX 750TI 2gb superclocked card, this GTX 750TI card does not require you to upgrade the power supply, which in this pc is 450watts) but CybertronPC sent mine with a 500watt power supply (Thank You, CybertronPC), you can use 2 monitors, game on one and watch Netflix on the other, it has 8 USB slots 4-3.0/4-2.0, it has DVI/VGA/HDMI for your monitors, no wireless built in, but you can get a wireless adapter for cheap, i prefer wired, it is totally upgradable, it comes with a 1 year warranty and lifetime tech support, i hear CybertronPC customer service is very good, it comes packaged very well and secured, it only comes with the computer, keyboard, mouse, driver/software disc and info materials and only weight 27 pounds. I got it in 2 days with Amazon Prime (Thanks Amazon). I have played games on this pc for up to 16 hours straight and downloaded games for 24 hours from Steam and it never got hot no matter how long it ran, it runs smooth and the fans are not loud, mine has one fan on the side window, one in the front and one on the heat sink, it also has room for 4 or more fans, the sound is 7.1 surround and high definition, it sounds magnificent with my 5.1 speakers (one complaint is that my software for control of the speakers just vanished, i can`t find it anywhere on the system, it (software) controlled the HD sound configuration) but the sound is fine and works with my speaker controls, but it`s just not the same), you can get this pc with free red, green or my indigo blue LED lights, on the side window and on the front of the pc. It looks so sexy with my blue lighted keyboard, lighted mouse and blue mouse pad. This pc is a dream come true for me and at an affordable price, i can`t say enough just how wonderful and fast this CybertronPC is. I would recommend this PC, to anyone on a budget or not, because it is a great, great computer from, CybertronPC. Thank You"}

When I say \"shell\" I simply mean this is the base parts you need for a strong processor, ram and HDD.  You don't have any of the junk that comes with a corporate company such as dell, this is preloaded with windows and you set up like you had built from the ground up.  I didn't get this for the gaming aspect but for the power it brings at an awesome price.  I produce wedding and sport videos, I need a strong CPU to edit HD video.  I had a 1.8 GHZ i5 laptop I was using and it was becoming almost unbearable on longer films to sit and wait while it rendered.  The other positive for us veteran IT's is the expandability, plenty of room to expand the ram to 32 gb, 2 extra DVD burn slots and I believe up to 5 scuzzy \"HDD\" slots.  I will need every bit of this to keep up with video especially during basketball season.  Ill give it to you straight the only \" CON \"  would be the design, build and the wired keyboard/mouse, The wired combo is nothing huge just simply go purchase a wireless version at staples or Walmart 30 to 40 also its built with a seemingly cheapish case with a plastic blue led fan.  After you pull from box and setup you very soon see that this is far from the truth and offers plenty of extra slots already set for internal fans to be installed in the future.  I was very skeptical ordering this during tax free weekend, however so far I can say I am satisfied for what this offers for 3.9 GHZ under 600."}

It also looks amazing with the blue lights on the fan.\n\nThere are some cons about this PC. It does not come wifi enabled so you have to buy wifi card that can use up two USB ports because it is so fat. Also the computer is giant so just think about where you will put it before buying.\n\nJust to warn people the computer does not come with speakers. That did not affect my star count though."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00GFG1B1A", "review": "After two weeks with this PC, I am quite happy with it.  As a budget PC, it runs great -- the main MMO game I play can't be run on highest graphics setting, but at middle settings it runs great.  I'm sure that if I wanted to spend a little more money for an upgrade Graphics card, it would run everything well.  For everything else I do, mainly business applications, e-mail and web surfing, the PC is great.  Frankly, I think I got a lot of PC for the money.\n\nThe case has more ventilation than any other PC I have owned.  That's great for cooling, but leaves a lot of openings for dust in the long term.  On the other hand, all that ventilation makes it easy to see into the case, so if there is a dust build-up, it will be easy to see and clean.  (I put mine up on a table, so dust should be less of a problem.)  The blue lights are nice without being obtrusive.  I do wish there was an exterior light showing when the hard drive is active, but if I look through some openings in the case, I can see the light on the hard drive -- it would just be a little more convenient if it was on the case.\n\nThere are two USB ports in the front, and six in the back. One for the Mouse, one for the keyboard, one for an extra peripheral and one more for an exterior back-up hard drive, and I still have plenty left.  There are two expansion bays in the front, so there's plenty of room to add other stuff.  Note that this computer does NOT come with a SD card reader, so take that into account if you have a camera with an SD card or want to load your phone's micro SD up with music.  If you want to add one, there's plenty of room for expansion, and the interior of the PC is roomy.\n\nIt came well packaged, and was easy to set up.  I would suggest, especially for folks who struggle to see small things, to copy down the Windows code before setting it up, as you will need that code.  The included keyboard and mouse are basic but usable.  I have mine set up with two monitors -- one using the DVI port, while the over uses the VGA port (I may get a longer HDMI cable for the second monitor).  It was fairly easy to set up the dual monitor set up.  One little thing I appreciate: the minimal documentation and extra parts came in a plastic bag that lets me store everything I need in one place.  (When I get a new computer, I like to copy down the Serial Number, Windows code and other information, then keep it all together in one place in case I need them later.)\n\nOne thing I also appreciated was the lack of \"bloatware.\"  The machine comes with the drivers needed in a basic Win 8.1 installation.  I didn't have to spend time deleting unneeded stuff.\n\nI have owned computers for a long time, but I hadn't used Windows 8 before, so it took some time to get the hang of it.  Despite all the complaints, I don't find it to be all that bad.  Be aware that this PC does not come with much documentation -- Cybertron assumes you already know how to run a PC.\n\nI decided to go with this PC because there were a lot of positive reviews, and Cybertron seems to be very focused on good customer service.  So far, I have had no problems at all, so I haven't needed the customer service.\n\nBottom Line:  I think I got a quality PC at a very good price."}

He echoed the same concern that other reviewers have made:  upgrade the video card.  Other than that, he thought it was a good starter system for the price.\n\nThe case is bigger than what I had in mind.  Plenty of room for expansion down the road.  I really like that the 8 GB of RAM are loaded into one slot instead of divided over four slots.\n\nI had a little difficulty with some maintenance software I was running.  After rebooting, the keyboard and mouse stopped working.  Chatted with tech support about the problem.  A cold reboot was suggested:  shutdown the computer, unplug the computer from the outlet, press the power button down for 30 seconds, plug the computer back into the outlet, turn the computer on.  It worked and I haven't had any problems since.  Thanks for your help Andy.\n\nAlso purchased the same system for my daughter.  Didn't run into the same problem mentioned above.\n\nBoth wanted Blue.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00GFG1B1A", "review": "I've been using this computer for about 3 weeks now and I couldn't be happier. I've been waiting to write a review until I've had a chance to use this computer for various things.\n\nFirst, yes, the fans are a little on the loud side. It doesnt bother me at all though. When you use \"novelty\" fans like this (with LED's and such) You pay for the \"coolness\" factor, not so much performance. If it really bugs you, you can replace them very easily and cheaply.\n\nIt's handled every game I've thrown at it. DayZ, Garry's Mod, Counter Strike, COD, Minecraft, Sims 3, Second Life, Portal... you get the idea. It played most of those games on max settings without skipping a beat. That being said, the graphics card that comes with it, IS NOT a high performance card. But you could have fooled me.\n\nI had a little video editing to do, so I loaded up Adobe After Effects and went to work. I had After Effects open, iTunes, Vuze and steam open while working, and the computer didn't even flinch. It rendered the final 10 min HD clip in no time (like 60-90 seconds) I was blown away.\n\nI stream a lot of content from my computer to other devices (Apple TV, iPad, other computers in the house) and it has handled multiple streams flawlessly.\n\nIt doesnt come loaded down with bloatware like some others do. There were a couple of things I deleted, but I don't think they were added by Cybertron.\n\nCustomer Service... IS AWESOME! I had an issue where after installing a bluetooth device and restarting the computer it got locked into some sort of restore mode where it just kept rebooting and trying to go back to a restore point, but was stuck in some sort of loop. So I called customer service to see what I should do. The issue seemed to fix it self after a force reboot, but their customer service rep was hell bent on trying to get that device working for me, even though it was a 3rd party product that they had no responsibility to cover. If you've ever delt with Dell or Gateway or even Apple, you know that once their product is working support ends there. Its up to you to then contact support for the device you are trying to install. They went above and beyond.\n\nI was a bit worried about buying a computer from a small company I've never heard of, but I'm glad I took that chance. I hope others do too. I'd be more than happy to answer any questions about this computer for anyone on the fence about it. And NO, I do not work for, nor am I sponsored by Cybertron (look at my other reviews going back years)."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00GFG1B1A", "review": "CybertronPC was relatively unknown to me, an average consumer. Their model is to take third party component and build a fairly good system with them. The Borg-Q is a great example of this and the system was receive ready to go with windows 8.1. It has a very good processor and comes with a decent amount of Ram to start with. All the components work perfectly together and the tower looks nice. There are a few downside that might make you reconsider this purchase but they can easily be fixed with a few installations of your own. The first issue I ran into was the \"graphics card\" wasn't really good... at all, but a quick replacement quickly fixed this issue. The other issue I had was the fact this did not come equipped with a wireless internet card (really a must in the computers of today). Other than that it really is a very good PC to build on and can become quite the gaming rig with very little work. If your a person who can build their own PC with very little trouble, this is not for you, but for everyone who just wants something to upgrade, this will do nicely."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00GFG1B1A", "review": "This is my first amazon review, and I feel as though this computer deserves some proper recognition. I have had some high powered computers in the past but they bit the dust and I decided it was time to get back into the game and bite the bullet and shell out some cash for a new one.\n\nPros:\n-The processor in this machine is not bad at all. Even though it is a quad core and not an 8-core processor, it still runs at 3.8ghz and you can overclock it if need be, just make sure you have the cooling equipment to do so.\n-The ram is stock ram, but that's not all that bad since it allows an easy upgrade to 16gb with another stock 8gb ddr3 stick of ram.\n-The motherboard is actually fairly large so when you do upgrade the graphics card in this machine, which you will, you don't have to worry about the card being too long.\nCons:\n-The graphics card is a 44 dollar Geforce GT 610, and if you want low resolution with steady FPS, you'll get your wish. But more than likely after you play around with a few different games that are more graphics intensive, you'll come back onto amazon and grab a higher priced graphics card. I have personally been playing around with borderlands 2, skyrim and a few other games and I have noticed that you can set the settings higher on games like borderlands 2 and team fortress 2 and get high textures with FPS in the mid to high 50s. After I played around with Skyrim I realized I had to drop the extra cash on a new graphics card so I ordered a GTX 750 ti SC since it is not extremely power intensive.\n-The power supply is a 450w which means that if you want to upgrade the graphics card to something a little more heavy and power consuming, you'll also be dropping some more money on another power supply.\n\nOverall for this price, you'll get a great mid-range gaming rig that is extremely easy to customize. This is a solid entry PC for those who want a long term investment."}

I highly recommend anything from this company."}

The graphics card is not by any means incredible, but if you do a lot of gaming, it could easily be swapped for a better one.\nI got the green version, and it looks pretty cool. The fan on the side is illuminated with green LEDs, as well as the one on the front. The power button is not lit up, which is a little bit disappointing, but not really a problem unless you are super picky about looks. The case is very large, giving it plenty of airflow. I have never felt anything but cool air coming out of the vents. The large case could possible encourage dust buildup, but a can of compressed air will take care of that quickly.

I could have bought similar components, even a better video card to those used in the CybertronPC Borg-Q GM4213C for very nearly the same price, I'm glad I didn't. Right out of the box the CybertronPC Borg-Q GM4213C has been great. The PC has been running 24/7 since mid May without a problem in a room that can hit 84 degrees at times. I admit I haven't used Windows 8 very much but I can navigate the system. I have played Borderlands2 without a hitch and all my other FPS games but the video card can barely handle Titanfall, I expected this based on other reviews so I'll upgrade the card in the fall. The case is large and easily accessible, the only complaint I have is the case fan is noisy but I hardly notice once I'm playing a game. I've owned a few Dell PC's since the late 90's and this CybertronPC Borg-Q GM4213C has performed as well as or better than any PC I've owned."}

So far, for the price I paid, it's been pretty good.\nUpgraded from a 4+ year Gateway crap machine.\n\nLots of great things ... it has a cool look with the neon blue. Front has a cool, solid, rugged look. It is a large desktop.\n\nFan is a little loud. Probably because there are so many openings. Holes in the top and slits in the blue side.\n\nNot a fan of win 8.1 ... not too bad once you figure out how things work ... but can't believe Microsoft didn't seamlessly integrate icons and app install with the new design. I still have trouble getting icons onto the desktop for apps that I install ...\n\nAlso, the back image was a little deceptive. There are monitor ports (DVI, VGA) built into the motherboard (or something like that). But apparently, they added a stronger video card which also has DVI and VGA and HDMI ports. When I saw the image, I thought I could use both DVI ports for dual monitors. Turns out that the added video card overrides the built in ports. So I can still get a dual monitor set up, but not for 2 DVIs ... I have to use DIV and VGA on the video card, which is still pretty good. Just not what I expected though.\n\nOverall, I'm pretty satisfied so far ... and at this price point (it actually dropped about 20 bucks since I bought it), I give it a thumbs up ... recommend."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00GFG1B1A", "review": "Bought and sold by Amazon, made by CybertronPC.  Windows 8.1 installed already.\n\nI've been putting this computer through the motions for the past month and a half since I received it.  My old Dell Dimension, which the CybertronPC Borg-Q replaced, finally kicked the bucket after about 8 years of usage.  Needless to say, this computer is a huge improvement in performance over that antiquated machine and I hope I get the same amount of usage from this computer as well.\n\nOne thing to note, my machine came with a 500 watt power supply, I was only expecting a 450 watt, per the specs given, so it was a pleasant surprise which may not be typical.  I was concerned about the power supply so this gave me a bit of leeway.\n\nI've since replaced the DVD burner with a blu ray burner.  I had hooked up my old hard drive from my previous computer as backup but have since removed it after copying over all the necessary files.  Since I've opened up the machine a couple times, I must note that this computer is one of the most organized computers I've seen in awhile.  My old Dell was horrendous, cables everywhere, not enough fans, etc.  Everything in this machine is practically all tied up in a neat bundle.  While I did have some issues trying to hook up the 2nd hard drive (a little more slack in the cable would have been appreciated), I was not prevented from doing so.\n\nI usually run my computer 24/7 and so far has not restarted throughout the night when I've been running some processes.\n\nI've experienced a few blue screens so far.  I'm unsure as the direct cause of it but I've since removed the 2nd hard drive in case it was power related, as it had initially been a concern of mine.  If I didn't always have an external hard drive, as well as a tablet charging from the USB ports (and a PS3 controller sometimes), I likely would have left it hooked up.\n\nI do plenty of AutoCAD work as well as some other engineering programs and it handles those quite well.  I've done some limited video encoding and it does it about twice as fast as my old computer.  I plan on expanding the RAM in the machine at a later date when the computer will likely start to slow down but right now it is unnecessary for my needs.\n\nI was quite sad to have my old computer die since I did not want to spend tons of money on a new computer.  This is a great machine for the price you get it for so I can't be too disappointed.  I also bought it because I've read that CybertronPC has excellent costumer service.  While I have yet to require it, should I in the future, I'm sure I'm in good hands.\n\nThis review was completed on May 26, 2014 after about a month and a half of usage. Should anything change, I will update with the issues and the date of occurrence."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00GFG1B1A", "review": "I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because it's hard for me to give anything 5 stars unless it's really superb. For the price this is very good. usually I buy all the parts and build a PC myself but I really doubt I could have saved any money by doing so after buying this one. However when I bought this last week it was a little over $100 cheaper then, and they are now out of stock with a waiting period as of the time of this post so I am glad I got it when I did.\n\nI did have one problem which was my fault and which I solved. I wanted to get into the BIOS to change a couple of settings but I couldn't. I tried a few different keyboards and nothing worked. I found out the 2 USB ports on the front of the PC where USB 3 which most BIOS's don't recognize on boot-up. I plugged the keyboard into a rear USB 2 port and then I could get into the BIOS.\n\nThis PC has a NVIDIA GeForce GT610 in the PCI-E x16 slot. I purchased another GT610 for the available PCI-E x1 slot; This is the model I purchased at Amazon which is for the PCI-E x1 slot; Zotac 1 GB DDR3 64-Bit ZT-60607-10L. With the desktop set to extend the displays, the original graphics card goes to a TV via a HDMI cable for watching Media Center recordings or live TV via  the external HDHomerun Prime I have which has a cable card. The new card goes to the PC monitor via a DVI cable. The 450 watt power supply that came with this PC handle both cards with no problems.\n\nLike I said, this new purchase is for having a secondary PC. My main PC has an AMD 6 core CPU and is significantly faster. Eventually I would like to upgrade the AMD 4 core on this new PC to a AMD 6 or 8 core but the heat sink on this CPU is humongous and I don't feel like going to the hassle of learning how to remove it to replace the CPU.  I probably will in the future but the PC is doing the job I bought it for just fine so I will be in no hurry to upgrade the CPU and I may never do so.\n\nEDIT.\n\nI changed it to 3 stars. I have been running the PC for a week now and it still runs fine. However when I tried to use a SSD in it there were issues.\n\nAfter putting the OS on a Crucial M500 240GB SSD and booting up there was no improvement in the speed in the Windows desktop loading or opening programs, also the desktop would occasionally lockup requiring a hard shutoff. I removed the SSD after putting the OS back on the original hard drive and the system was stable again.\n\nI decided to put the SSD in another PC after I had transferred its OS to it. The PC used to be slow when it loaded the Windows desktop but now it loads super-fast and programs open faster. It has been stable for the last few days since I put it in so the SSD isn't faulty. I am assuming the Gigabyte motherboard, for some unknown reason, just won't work well with SSD's. If there is something else I need to do to make it work right someone please comment and let me know and I'll change my review.\n\nEDIT.\n\nI ordered a Intel SSD and will try it again on this new PC. After I get it installed sometime late next week I'll post the results. I'm hoping by going with Intel that this time it will be more compatible.\n\nEDIT.\n\nI mentioned earlier that a SSD drive I put in didn't do any good so I took it out. I found out what the problem was. I installed a CPU gadget and it consistently showed the PC was using about 26% of the CPU and that is with no applications open. I looked at the installed programs and there was something there for device management platform. I can't remember the companies name (I think it started with a V) for that software but Windows has it's own built-in device manager so I uninstalled that program. I'm sure that program was on the driver CD that came with the PC or was pre-installed when I bought the PC. My CPU immediately dropped down to about 2 or 3% and stayed there which is normal. I put the SSD drive back in and now my Windows desktop boots up fast as it should and my applications open up faster. Now I am happy. I now give it 4 stars."}

As this is a starter computer that can be built upon, the hardware isn't top-of-the-line (knowlingly so, this isn't a bad thing), so higher end games don't run well on high settings.

I was pretty frustrated, but the technician was helpful and it was really easy to get a hold of them. So I give it a 3 star rating for right now because I am frustrated that I don't have it, but I am happy with the customer service and speedy delivery. i will re rate and edit this post when I get the finished product.\n\nGot the finished product.  Its freaking amazing.  They even uograded my graphics card aince I got a bad cpu on a new comp. I highly recommend this computer and company!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00GFG1B1A", "review": "Like many reviewers, I was cautiously skeptic of this computer due to the price and seemingly unbelievable positive reviews. I am relieved and happy to say that I made the right decision in purchasing from CybertronPC. Here's why:\n\nI was virtually forced to get a new system due to MS discontinuing support for XP. Plus, I am an emerging photographer and my old system(as in ten years old) just couldn't handle the image files I was throwing at it anymore. So, I needed something new, and fast...bottom line. This computer fits the bill with flying colors. Even though I don't game, this system satisfies all of my needs with room to grow. Burns through heavy photo editing and has plenty of room to expand with my needs.\n\nI also have a testimonial, albeit embarrassing, to the CybertronPC customer service department. I stupidly connected my monitor to the disabled ports instead to the active ports of the video card. When I called, they calmly remedied the problem without making me feel like a moron for having made such a noob mistake.\n\nBOTTOM LINE:\nGreat product at a great price with good packaging and customer service. If you're having reservations about purchasing this PC, just do what I did. BUY IT."}

I can run BF4 at low settings, Skyrim at medium settings (some areas do lag), I can play Rome Total War (the first one) at high settings, Euro Truck Simulator at medium settings. Obviously it's got its limitations for the price I paid.\n\nThe good news is that there's plenty of room for upgrades, so if you really want to play games at high settings you'll have to spend a little more on upgrades.\n\nI am no PC expert so I am not even attempt to build a gaming rig from scratch.  I work 12 hours a day, therefore I have no time to build one.  This is what this rig is perfect for: Spend a little $$ and then spend a little more $$ on upgrades; which is what I'll be doing.\n\nI'll definitely be buying a beefier graphics card, power supply and a bigger hard drive.  For the price however, I can hardly complain.  There's no doubt I'll be running Skyrim at ultra high settings with the proper upgrades."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00GFG1B1A", "review": "After much research, I kept coming back to Cybertron because of the reviews here on Amazon.com. They seem like a company that wants to take care of their customers (based on their responses to small concerns here.) I had no concerns whatsoever! Thanks to Prime (and an added $15 to get my computer in one day instead of the free two) I am now a very satisfied customer and love my green Borg-Q!\n\nThe Good:\n\n* It came extremely packaged. Big box, plenty of packing material, all the CD's, etc.\n* This computer case is huge, well ventilated, nice fans that glow, plenty of room for expansion, etc.\n* Setup was a snap. I've never used Windows 8.1 before and had to remember my old hotmail password to log in. I have been very skeptical about Windows 8 (especially coming from Windows 7 and a couple of Macs.) Once I found out how to get to my familiar desktop (click on the desktop tile) and once I knew how to get rid of Internet Explorer as my default browser (with the terrible Bing search engine--I installed Chrome and use google) and once I learned how to shut down (move mouse to the right, move it down, click on devices, then shut down--way too many steps--shame on you Microsoft) then I kinda liked it.\n* This computer screams! It is so much faster than my 2012 iMac with 12gb ram.\n* I've installed Team Fortress 2 and run it in 1080p with no frame skip whatsoever--very smooth. I'm not a \"need 150 frames per second, liquid cooling, overclocking\" kinda guy--I just want decent graphics, decent frame rate and GOOD GAMEPLAY!!! I come from the Commodore 64 days, folks!\n* I installed Minecraft and my 6 year old hopped right to it and put down a bunch of TNT, made a switch, blew it up and he yelled, \"NO LAG!\" Minecraft plays extremely smooth--much better than my Macs.\n* Unlike some reviewers, I actually like the logitech keyboard and mouse. I actually use the same keyboard here at work and can type very fast on it. I may switch to a wireless mouse but the one I got with my computer is light and very responsive--I like it a lot. Once again, I'm a fan of Logitech mice and keyboards to begin with.\n* Boots up extremely fast.\n\nTHE BAD\n* Nothing bad about the computer except the sticker on the center of the fan is not exactly centered so it has a wobbly look when spinning. I may just peel it off. Does not deter from the computer in the least.\n* Windows 8 (even though I have 30+ years computer experience) has some strange design choices--a small learning curve--obviously built more for touch devices--the store scrolling left and right instead of up and down for example. Once again, I don't exactly hate Windows 8.1--just need to get used to it.\n\nIn conclusion, I am so happy I chose this computer. I play a few games (have not tried any processor intensive games yet), do some visual basic programming, browse, pictures, etc. and this is a fast, smooth, good looking computer. I would highly recommend it and their company. The process with Amazon was smooth and I may even keep Prime! LOL."}

The Cybertron name kept popping on excellent reviews. I checked this one out and it had everything that I needed as of now.  I can always upgrade which is always good for later, if needed.  I decided that I would try win 8 even with all of the horror stories about win 8.  Well Win 8 is not that bad just another learning curve( I bought a book on win8.1).  I just switch from desktop to tiles to desktop.\n\nAnyway back to Cybertron, it arrived in two days, opened the heavy duty box up , attached monitor and speakers, plugged it in and was on my way. Completely checked out the computer and all was OK in the case, very nice and neat.  My grand kids were very impressed with the blue lights and the clear case panel.  It handles the few games that I play with no problem.  It is very fast.  One of the features that I needed was a hdmi port so I could plug in my monitor hdmi and this worked great.  Another excellent feature is their warranty.  It did not have the recovery disks, so I called and Cybertron shipped that same day.\n\nOne of the best things is there is no bloated extra software that I would have to delete.  I would highly recommend Cybertron computers to anyone."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00GFG1B1A", "review": "I toyed with the idea of buying this particular Cybertron model on Amazon, but really wanted to customize it and, unfortunately, that option was not available on the Amazon Website. So I bought an upgraded version of this PC directly from Cybertron PC and paid the $34.38 shipping charge that I would have avoided at Amazon. My version differs from the model advertised here only in that it has a somewhat faster AMD-FX-4350 4.2GHz processor, a larger 600W PSU, and a NET-TEN-W311MIA TENDA Pico USB WiFi adapter installed. Subsequently, I added another 8 GB Crucial RAM module, only because I use the machine a lot for processing large numbers of photographic images at a time. Total cost of my version, including shipping, was $681.47, still a bargain for such a capable machine. I was particularly impressed with Cybertron's build quality. The case is spacious, yet light, with plenty of room for expansion. All the interior cabling and wiring is neatly tucked away making all the components easily accessible. Set-up was child's play and totally intuitive. The machine is not only super-quiet, but silent .... I am simply unable to detect any fan noise whatever. Yet the case is so well ventilated that there is no heat build-up at all. The machine is exceptionally fast, both at start-up and shut-down and during processing, much faster than my seven year-old, self-built, premium Intel Core-Duo system it replaced. I also want to comment favorably on the tiny TENDA USB WiFi adapter I bought as part of the upgrades. It is incredibly fast ... instant ... and never disconnects from my wireless hub as my old USB WiFi had the annoying habit of doing. Overall, I am totally happy with this purchase thus far and highly recommend the CybertronPC brand. My only nit is the skimpy paper documentation that was shipped with it. Five stars!"}

The unit had to be with my neighbor for a few days as I was out of town with my wife at her hospitalization, the computer was purchased for her, to replace a unit that had died due to a spike of voltage due to a lighening strike.  This unit has everything she wanted, she doesn't play games, but is on the internet, and has a slew of pictorials and word documentation from her notes journal and her email's and her letter writing and printing.  I've also purchased a cannon printer to accompany this unit, as it suffered the same consquences of the voltage damage, and needed a new world order - as in replace and then bury.  So I can say without trepedation that this unit meets all of its written and presented diagnostics of operational purview by the manufacturer, to date anyway.  I can say at this juncture in time that I would recommend this PC Desk Top as a suitable replacement for any aging unit; the only cavet is the powersupply which I may have to bump us for an external backup drive of 1 TB and the addition of a multi-card reader for her photography.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00GFG1B1A", "review": "This is essentially a brick with a broken version of windows 8.1.  I attempted to install the correct drivers that came with the system, and I couldn't.  My disk usage is at %100 constantly rendering this pc useless.  I have attempted to restore the pc to factory settings and cannot, because I am missing windows 8 files and guess what........recovery disks are not given to you.\n\nThis is a defective product, DO NOT BUY\n\nUPDATE***\n\nThrough hours of research attempting to fix this PC, I have come to find that my issue is in fact related to windows 8 and not the pc hardware itself.  I originally thought that my issue was due to conflict within drivers, but it appears that this is not the case.  I cannot blame Cybertron for issues with a crappy operating system.  I am changing my review to 3 stars.  I will gladly award an additional star when I obtain my recovery disk.  The PC is working fine, albeit the common windows 8 \"100% disk usage\" issue.  Knowing this, I feel as I owe a more detailed and honest review.\n\nTHE GOOD\n\n1.  style:  This box looks great in the pictures, and it doesn't disappoint in the flesh...er... plastic/metal.  I'm really impressed with the healthy balance between looking like an impressive gaming machine but still being subtle enough for a casual user.\n\n2. workmanship: By far the most attractive feature about this rig is discovered once belly of the beast is removed.  I am a STICKLER for neat and professional workmanship, and this is probably as close to perfection as you can get.  Every wire bundle and harness is neatly tucked out of the way, with multiple safety ties to keep everything clean and organized.  Every edge is straight, and the case actually looks NEW (like it's supposed to look).\n\n3.  Value for specs:  Itemize and price every component in this build separately and it will come out to a much steeper price point than the selling price.  Factor in labor time and knowledge and this turns out to be a pretty solid deal.  This really is a great price for what's in the box.\n\nTHE BAD\n\n1.  If you are planning on using this PC for anything other than web browsing and social media, plan on buying a new mouse and keyboard.  I know this isn't a thousand dollar rig but the quality of the mouse and keyboard is pathetic.  Other reviews support this statement.\n\n1.5  Windows 8 is not very popular for non-touch devices and for good reason: it is a bug ridden mess.  I would recommend purchasing this PC on the manufacturer's site and opting for Windows 7 instead.  You can always upgrade (if you can call it that) later.  I CHOSE to purchase this PC on amazon knowing it has Windows 8, and I take responsibility for that.  That being said, try to avoid windows 8 if you can.\n\n2.  This rig comes with a minor-moderate bottleneck, depending on the usage intentions.  If you plan on using this PC for ANY type of graphical intensive game, you will need to upgrade the GPU.  HERE is a link showing the benchmarks of this card:\n\n[...]\n\nThis will most likely result in the power supply requiring an upgrade too.  Casual users should find no issue with this rig right out of the box.  I chose to replace the GT 610 with a Nvidia GTX 760 and a 750w corsair power supply.  I can now run pretty much everything on high or ultra settings.\n\n3.  I did not receive my recovery disks.  I will be contacting support to hopefully resolve this issue.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\ngreat deal for the price, but moderate-heavy gamers may find the GPU to be rather lackluster.  Professionally crafted, and somewhat future proof with plenty of room for ugrades.\n\nI will contact support to locate my missing windows disc and will update my review further.\n\nUPDATE AFTER ONE YEAR********  (July 25. 2015)\n\nHaving MUCH more knowledge about building systems, looking back I can say with confidence that this pc is not a very cost effective deal.  If you are planning on playing anything above minesweeper, you will need some serious upgrades in the immediate future.  The graphics card it comes with is older than dirt.  It costs about $40 by itself.  The case is $50.  The motherboard is about $60.  The hard drive is of decent quality but is still only about $60.  You are paying a huge premium to have this system assembled for you.  Granted, this is one year later and hardware has advanced but still, be warned that you can most likely build a system 2x better for the same or less money.\n\nI upgraded the GPU immediately to a GTX 760  which was about $220 (middle range GPU).  Even if you buy the most powerful GPU money can buy, you will still be limited by the motherboard (also old as dirt) and the average AMD processor this build comes with.  That being said, there is nothing WRONG with these components.  Just please understand that this is NOT a powerful gaming pc.  The GPU, CPU, and motherboard must be upgraded in the very near future after purchase....be aware that these components are usually the 3 most expensive parts in any system build.\n\nFINAL CONCLUSION\n\nThis PC is well built but definitely not a gaming PC.  Cybertron has great customer service and I apologize to them for my irrationally angry review a year ago.  I was dealing with an infuriating windows 8 bug that I wrongly attributed to this PC.\n\nThat being said, CybertronPC skimped on the core components required for gaming (GPU, CPU. MOBO).  To put this in perspective, I have replaced (replaced as in upgraded) the graphics card, motherboard, CPU, power supply,  and case fans.  The only original components still remaining are the case and hard drive (and I will be upgrading the case soon).  I cannot in good faith recommend this as a gaming PC when it is not decently equipped to do so.  You are paying an enormous premium for these components when better builds are available for less money.\n\nPROS:\n-good customer service\n-neatly constructed\n-professional cable management\n\nCONS\n-not a gaming PC\n-overpriced based on components\n-will require financially large and immediate upgrades to stay relevant with the majority of current games.\n\ngave two stars for CybertronPC's customer service and quick replies to reviews"}

The case has plenty of ventilation which may lead to plenty of potential dust build up, but the internal components are well organized with plenty of space to work around. Opening up the case is quite easy, so dusting won't be too great of a task. The aesthetics of the case are fine. I don't see the need for all of the sharp angles on the front, and the bright blue lights in the case come off as an ostentatious and unnecessary power drain, but the appearance is quite low on my list of priorities.\n\nThe machine comes with a 1 TB hard drive, 450 watt power supply, and an NVIDIA GeForce GT610 video card. 1 TB is plenty of space for most Steam users and I haven't run into any issues with the power supply. The video card is certainly the weak link on that list. I attempted to run Resident Evil 6 on medium settings but couldn't continue due to crippling lag from the video card. I swapped the NVIDIA with my old HD Radeon 7770, and everything ran perfectly. Replacing the video card was very easy due to the well organized internal components (less than 10 minutes). I may add a second hard drive in the future, but I'm not sure if the power supply will be able to handle the extra draw. (I will update this review when I get around to testing that idea.)\n\nThe biggest drawback of the computer is that it comes with Windows 8 as the OS. I intend to use this PC exclusively for gaming, so I won't have to be bothered with the Win 8 OS too much, but I would recommend sticking with Windows 7 if you don't have the luxury of a owning multiple computers.\n\nOn a five point scale I would give this PC a 4.6, but Amazon wants me to stick with whole numbers so I'm rounding up. This is an excellent value for the $500 range. There is plenty of room to upgrade individual parts in the future, and I would recommend starting with the video card."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00GFG1B1A", "review": "What I love:\nProcessor - Very powerful, extremely pleased with performance on my games.  I can run them on max settings with no problems.\nHard Drive - More than adequate for my needs.  I do have two externals for most items though.\nTower - Really well made and all fans run silent.\n\nWhat I like:\n8GB DDR3 Memory - I plan to add to this in the near future.  It does have 3 more slots so adding later is not an issue.\nKeyboard & Mouse - Basic serves it's purpose, does have small footprint which is a plus.\n\nWhat I don't like:\nWindows 8.1 - This is mainly preference due to compatibility issues with my AMD graphics card.\n\nOther:\nPower supply and graphics card were changed out upon arrival.  So I can not comment on those.  I do plan to add those to the wife's computer in the coming days so may update."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00GFG1B1A", "review": "My old computer (20 years with various upgrades) was not successfully booting up. It was time to let it go. So I started my search and I decided this Cybertron had enough of the right parts, had very good reviews, and was right for the price. I have had it a week and there has not been one problem. I plugged in all the old components (have a lot more USB connections which is great), watched it set itself up, and it's been smooth sailing ever since. I'm finally able to watch online videos without tons of hiccups. Windows 8.1 is OK but I still like to use the optional old desktop instead. It has great Music app that is ready a lot faster than Itunes. I would not hesitate to recommend this PC to others."}

The installation of components is flawless. A very clean build. The pictures do not do this tower justice. It's very quiet also. I have not tested hardcore gaming on it yet...but so far what I played has been hiccup free. I normally build my own computers, but Cybertron has impressed me. I will recommend this company to friends and family. For the price, what you get, is almost too good to pass up. Thanks Cybertron and Amazon for making this experience way better than i thought it would be."}

Only problem was that the front of the case came slightly cracked but It's not that big of a problem because it's just the cases for the empty CD-drive slots and I'm pretty sure it happened during the shipping.\n\nEdit** I emailed them about the problem and got replacement parts very quickly. Changing rating to 5 stars."}

I ordered it on 1-25 and received it 7 days later.  It was packaged to handle delivery-by-gorillas! (UPS dropped it off with a pristine box anyway).  There was three inches of foam between the chassis and the box.  Got it set up quickly.  Had some networking issues (my own fault - forgot about the filters on my router) but customer service was great!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00GFG1B1A", "review": "Looked on amazon for a while checking out computers and trying to stay in my budget, read a review that said go to Cybertronpc website and save about $160 so that got my attention. I was able to build and order the pc that I wanted with windows 7 premium with power supply and video card upgrades and get the version of windows that I wanted. Read to many horror stories about windows 8 plus I'm still learning windows 7, was a avid xp pro user for years. The computer took a few days to build and was shipped and delivered within a week from ordering it. Fired right up without having do anything except plug in the power cord and connect what ever devices I wanted. The computer in short is lightening fast and seems so far to be very reliable. I will order from Cybertronpc again for my next build. The sales were very helpful,offered options that weren't on the screen. I give it a 5 star, would give it more if more stars were available. Strongly recommend going there. I stayed within the $160 price difference,they were that much cheaper than amazon and I'm a huge customer of amazon.\nJim"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00GFG1B1A", "review": "I spent a long time looking at many different computer manufacturers before I settled on Cybertron. I wasn't sure whether or not I wanted to move to Windows 8, but since this came with Windows 8.1 (which fixed a bunch of the problems with the original Windows 8 release), I figured it was worth trying.\n\nI wanted something that could run games but also work well for dealing with pictures and video. Setup was a breeze, and it has a satisfying blue grow when turned on.\n\nThe fan is significantly quieter than the one on the laptop I replaced with this item.\n\nI was apprehensive at first, but Cybertron has proved that they are on par with the big computer companies out there.\n\nI would definitely recommend this item to others, especially for the price compared to getting the same thing from Dell or Lenovo.\n\nIt's a great product overall."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00GFG1B1A", "review": "Been using it for about two weeks now, and so far, it's doing fine. If anyone here is looking for regular gaming, then I would suggest you research and buy another better graphic card as you make this purchase. Also, you cannot have max setting for Arma 2, BF4, or even Skyrim with the GT610 it contains and expect 30fps (frame per second). Other than that, it's a good purchase for upgrading from a normal laptop."}

I called support and they were very helpful but they stated that the wiring sometimes works it way loose in shipping but in my opinion, that was not the case. It was tucked neatly away and was never connected up when it was  assembled. I have worked on computers in the past so it was not a problem for me to get it working but for someone that was not computer savoy, it would have been a nightmare. Anyway, it has worked fine so far and I am pleased with it's performance for the price."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00GFG1B1A", "review": "Great base model PC, not a gaming machine out of the box. Power supply, video card and memory has to be upgraded to play even the simplest of games, well other than FarmVille.\n\nThe day I received it, plugged everything in and it would not boot up Windows. Called tech support and we ran through some things before finally having to reinstall Windows. It worked fine after that.\n\nI bought this in Feb 2016, by June 2017, the DVD and 1 fan died. It is no longer under warranty so I replaced them myself.\n\nCase is large and spacious, moves a lot of air for cooling but it sucks in dust like an air filter. The decorative plastic side piece looks nice but allows too much dust to come in and I think makes it run louder when the fans kick on.\n\nI have to clean the interior and CPU heatsink about every other month. My room is not that dirty...\n\nThe mobo and how it sits in the case does not give you a lot of room. It was hard to run wires and very little clearance once I added a 1070 video card.\n\nBefore I upgraded, it was able to run standard office programs. This is not a workhorse PC out of the box. It is a good base model PC. You get what you pay for here.\n\nI priced this against Dell, NewEgg and BestBuy...all had similar PCs with similar hardware but this one had a better price at the time."}
