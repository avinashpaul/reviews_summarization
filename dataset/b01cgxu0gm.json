{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B01CGXU0GM", "review": "To fully understand my review, must explain a few things. I come to owning the iPad Pro 9.7\" via a long lineage of Macs, iPods, iPhones and iPads. I've owned five MacBooks since 2006, the iPhone, iPhone 3G, iPhone 4, iPhone 4S, iPhone 5, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S. I've also owned the iPad Mini 2, iPad 4, iPad Air 2, and for a brief time, the iPad Pro 12.9\".\n\nThe minority of upgrades along this ownership have been truly revolutionary. Moving to the Retina MacBook Pro from a regular 13\" MacBook pro was a huge one. The iPhone 4 over the iPhone 3G was pretty huge.\n\nAfter thinking about the iPad Pro 9.7\", it's hard to say whether it's a revolutionary upgrade. I'm leaning toward \"no,\" but I could be swayed over time. The reason I got rid of the 12.9\" model was that it was way too big to fly with (I'm a private pilot who uses it for navigation/charts) and I was unable to procure an Apple Pencil due to low stock. Now that I have a true iPad Pro *and* the Apple Pencil, I'm more qualified to talk about what kind of upgrade this is.\n\nSome things I like:\n\n4 speakers: Apple has finally caught up with other manufacturers who give you stereo sound by default, even on cheap tablets. Heck, my old Nexus 7 2nd generation even had stereo speakers. So, when I upgraded from that to an iPad Mini 2, it was a downgrade speaker-wise. Now I feel like I'm back where I should be. The speakers on the Pro 9.7\" are not *quite* as mind-blowing as the speakers on the 12.9\", but they're still better than any other iPad that came before. For their size, they're truly fantastic.\n\nPencil: Wow, this is progress. It doesn't sample quite as fast as the Pro 12.9\", but it's still very much as close to a pen-and-paper writing experience as you can get. The quality of the experience depends highly on the quality of app you're using, and I can say I really like Adobe Sketch and Procreate. For taking note and annotating PDFs  the primary reason for this purchase over keeping an iPad Air 2  I really like Notability. The pencil support in Notability is good, about 80% there, but makes annotating PDFs a real joy compared to the hassle of dealing with print. My handwriting is terrible, and Notability does a good job replicating it to a T. I write small, and much to my surprise, the Apple Notes app is much poorer at recording my small bad handwriting than is Notability. Interesting how a native app does worse than a 3rd party app on what is supposed to be a killer feature.\n\nBattery life: Great!\n\nSpeed: Lightning fast for everything. I can't tell how much faster it really is than the iPad Air 2, but benchmarks seem to be putting it ahead favorably. Multitasking is very very fast.\n\nNegatives:\n\nBattery charge time: Still slow! Apple needs to up their charging game if they want to remain competitive. I'm used to my Apple products taking a significant charge in a short period of time, but it's just not the case with the iPad Pro.\n\nScreen space: I know I intentionally got rid of the iPad Pro 12.9\" in favor of this one, but I feel like I run out of palm space a lot when I'm writing with the Pencil. I'm a southpaw, so sometimes I'll just write on the right side of the screen and/or keep another app open on the left side where my palm can rest.\n\nMultitasking: Apple really needs to find a way for any two apps to multitask. What about having two instances of Safari open side-by-side? Ability to instantly swap sides? All missing.\n\nTouchID speed: Still a first-gen sensor (think iPhone 5S... old, right?), which is much much slower and less accurate compared to the sensor on my iPhone 6S.\n\nOverall, I like the iPad for what it is. I think that for $820 after tax for the iPad, Pencil, and magnetic screen cover, I have a right to expect a bit more progress on certain items. iPads were already expensive enough at $500, but they need to do a little bit better of a job justifying the \"Pro\" part of the \"iPad Pro.\""}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01CGXU0GM", "review": "I upgraded from the iPad 2nd generation and this thing is fantastic! It's so much faster, even the wifi. The 9.7 seems the right size to me as I want something easily mobile for on the bus, plane, etc. and the larger pro seems bulky. Although I have a computer, I use this thing for a lot of my writing (http://www.amazon.com/-/e/B00DUNR9IU) and this upgrade just makes it easier to jot down ideas and get an early start on a project."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01CGXU0GM", "review": "Perfect display, fantastic with the pencil and keypad.  Toss up about the size - you'll just need to get to a store and experiment with the two sizes.  Opted for the smaller one for all the time I spend on airplanes.  Amazing number of Apps ready for the pencil.  Less intrusive during meetings than a laptop.  Replaces my Laptop for nearly every task, except photo editing and detailed spreadsheet work."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01CGXU0GM", "review": "My last iPad was the third generation and that was 4 years ago. Now it has gotten old and slow. So, two months ago I started to look at new devices. Surprise! My husband bought me the 12.9\" iPad Pro. Very nice device but BIG!!!! So hubby took over the new IPad and I waited until the latest iPad Pro 9.7\" was released.  The 9.7\" Pro is a bit narrower than the old iPads but has the same sized screen. Unless you have really big hands and long fingers the 12.9\" Pro is unwieldy to hold as a tablet and to type. Also, the 9.7\" Pro is much lighter weight than the older models full sized iPads and the same weight as the iPad Air.  The graphics are exceptional as is the upgraded 12MP camera. It will not take the place of a DSLR camera for the camera buff but for me, who loves to take pictures of family, pets, and items to list on eBay, it is awesome. There is another feature that the camera does which is called a \"live\" shot. It is not a video but a mini snipit of about three seconds. This feature literally brings a picture to life. You hold your finger on the shot and it comes alive.  It is the difference between taking a picture of a child as they blow out that first candle on their cake and actually seeing the child blowing it out. Amazing!  As an long time iPad user I knew that I would need at least the 128GB for my apps, updates, pictures and music. Even though we subscribe to a 200GB iCloud storage plan it is amazing how quickly all that data takes up space. It would be a real shame to buy a device and skimp on something so basic. My first iPad did not have cellular and that was a big mistake for me, personally.  Public wi-if is not secure so I was limited to take a risk and use it or go without. It was a real bummer when we lost power!!!!!  Most cellular plans will let you hook up to 10 devices for $10 dollars each a month. This is a small price to pay to always be connected and to have your identity protected.  Will this take the place of a desktop or laptop? For me it does 99 percent of the time. It is perfect for social networking, skyping, uploading pictures, writing documents and printing them off of a wireless printer and, of course, on-line shopping. If I was still in grad school or running a business then I would probably need a laptop or desktop. As with all Apple products they are intuitive. The set up is a breeze and if you have an issue the Apple support team is just a phone call away. I am loving my new iPad 9.7 Pro and I know you will, too!\n\nThanks for reading my review and for pressing the \"helpful\" button if it was helpful to you. If you have questions and I can help please do not hesitate to write to me.\n\nSince I raved about the camera I thought I would share a couple pictures I took of my cat and also of my new iPad!!!!!! I also added two pictures of my living room. The second one is taken with a panoramic setting."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01CGXU0GM", "review": "I just started using the iPad today, so I will update this review after I've spent more time using it. My first impression is very positive! It's a beautiful device. So sleek and thin. It's my first Apple device and I am in love with the interface. It's intuitive, colorful, great to use. The fingerprint reader is awesome and makes signing in and purchasing apps extremely convenient. The Apple Pencil is compatible with this version of the iPad, which is lots of fun. I like the multi-task feature a lot. I purchased this to use with the Apple Pencil as a drawing tablet, but after seeing the gorgeous screen I think this will become my device of choice for watching movies too.\n\nWhen you get the device, make sure that the first thing you do is to install updates. If you don't have the most up-to-date version of iOS, you won't be able to download certain apps.\n\nAlso - Before you make your purchase, see what the prices are for different storage sizes. The silver 256 GB was cheaper than the 128 GB. Pretty incredible deal!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01CGXU0GM", "review": "As I have had other similar sized iPads in the past, I was initially not sure if I wanted to purchase another iteration of the 9.7 iPad or not.  It turns out it was a spectacular decision.  The differences in the \"pro\" version of this tablet have set it apart head an shoulders over the others in the family.  First, is the screen - it just looks better.  The adaptive display is subtle and very, very clear.  I prefer to change the font to bold as it pops a bit more - but man is it easy to see.  It is easy on the hands too..  i know this sounds funny, but some screens you fingers get caught up on when you run them across the surface - this one does not seem that way.  Now lets talk storage 256 gigs.  I am not going to run out of room.  I can install whatever i feel like without having to stress out about it.  Next is the cellular service - I travel - and the ability to access my service wherever I go - without having to tether to my phone or rely on iffy wifi hotspots is very very nice.  But the BIGGEST and nicest feature of all on this tablet is the sound.  OMG  they put four little speakers (one on each corner) or this thing that will tear your head off.  When you hear a piano - it SOUNDS like a piano.  Now you won't be shaking the floor with it...  but make no mistake..  this is a geometric leap in sound reproduction over any tablet that i have heard yet.  If i had heard one of these tablets on a showroom floor - I would have bought it on the spot.  If you are a person who likes playing games and watching movies, this is THE go to table for portability and functionality.  Love it."}

But this 9.7 Pro from the previous year is superior to the new iPad in almost every regard, while also supporting the Apple Pencil and Smart Keyboard accessories, at a lower price than the current Pro models.  This is what guided my decision.  Its in kind of a sweet spot right now with performance and affordability.

My old Ipad didn't have compatibility with many of the apps I use and I had to upgrade. That being said I am very happy with my purchase to upgrade, the new Ipad software is far superior to the old IOS. WHAT I AM NOT HAPPY WITH is that the Ipad came with a section of the screen that will not respond to touch. Like there is a strip down the center of the Ipad that appears to be broken and will not let me write (with my apple pencil) or drag anything across it (like moving apps or playing games). It's almost as if someone had dropped their Ipad and they tried to repair it, without actually fixing the problem. I needed to replace my last Ipad because I use it for notes for school, and I didn't really make a big deal about the screen because I needed to use it for notes right away and the screen was a minor inconvenience. Now after having it for about 4 months, the screen is extremely annoying as I wanted to use it for drawing and note taking and I have to strategically go around half the screen."}

The seller indicated the item was new and it shows it as new on the Amazon invoice.  After 6 months of use, the screen recently started cracking with no apparent reason.  I contacted apple and got an e-mail confirmation that the product was sold on July 28, 2016.  I found that odd because I purchased it from Lex Dealhouse on Amazon on July 14, 2017, almost a full year later.  So, I guess the item wasn't new after all.  I love this ipad and just want to get the screen fixed.  A new screen is $379 from Apple.  I really like the sound from this Ipad.  It has 4 speakers and the sound it light years ahead of the sound out of my 1 speaker Ipad 4.  I highly recommend purchasing the Ipad Pro 9.7.  Just make sure you have a warranty after you receive.  You can contact apple and give them the serial number and they will confirm it for you."}

I was worried that the 9.7 Pro was the forgotten child of the pro family because Apple wasn't selling it on their site. But I really like this iPad as an option. The optimal scenario would have been to keep my 4th gen but it wouldnt update to iOS 11. This is similar to my 4th gen in size. I was afraid a 10.5 would be too bulky and also wanted to save a little cash. I don't need all the artistic bells and whistles of a bigger Pro but did kinda want the upgraded camera, 4K video, resolution and processor. Because my 4th gen lasted for 5years, I went with the 256gb and am hoping this will be supported for years to come. My husband got the 2017. At this point, after using them for a couple days, I don't notice a huge difference between the two.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B01CGXU0GM", "review": "To be honest I think this is the worst product Apple has. First, it is an ipad... an ipad is a sort of device that software is supposed to be less powerful because usually apps are very cheap. Therefore, this is huge device that it is useless for serious work other than drawing ( I am a photographer). Photoshop, lightroom and so on are very very basic apps on the ipad world as I said totally useless. The size of ipad for work other than drawing is totally uncofortable, in fact does not make sense buying the keyboard case... I suggest buying an Ipad Air instead. The last OS (ios11) is really the worst OS I have seen in the Apple world because is the reaction of apple to the Windows 10 tablets that are really powerful in comparisson with. The  new IOS is ... I don't know.. complicated... this is a sort of fix to make the ipad more \"pc\" but at the same time apple has the challenge of no building an non-practical IOS for iphone. If you want to use it you have to read a lot of instructions you have to swipe n-times to make the ipad do whatever you want.. NO... sorry this is a bad product. i suggest buying an Macbook Air or Macbook pro if you want a powerful machine. I f you want drawing buy the small one and use \"duet\" this is a cool app but does not waste your money. if you want a serious tablet buy a Windows one (yes it is sad) you can use your serious apps there."}

I've searched high and low on all the description and have not found ANYTHING to acknowledge this, which may be a huge issue for anyone who wants to protect their device through Apple.\n\nIf you're not planning to get AppleCare then this shouldn't matter anyways :)"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01CGXU0GM", "review": "I love the iPad Pro and I got this version at a great price once they release the 10.5\" model. It functions so well that I have mostly been able to dock my MacBook Pro and use this instead. The iPad Pro functions so well never having an issue with slowing down even when using a lot of functions and apps. The multitasking feature works extremely well for work, play, or communication. It makes sending a quick, email, text, looking up something, etc. extremely easy and helps you not lose your place on your work. Honestly I cannot recommend the iPad Pro enough I have had multiple iPads and iPhones and the Pro is the first one that has the capability of being used as a work replacement for my laptop. It is not 100% there but between 85%-90%.\n\nThey are separate purchases but the apple Smart Keyboard for the iPad Pro is awesome. Not lugging around an extra keyboard just a case that has a slightly larger bulk and you have a great keyboard to use with your iPad. Likewise the pencil is nice as well, although I wish it had more features.\n\nIf you have questions send them my way, I am glad to help."}

I come from a mixed household though with both Apple and Android phones, using an I-phone for work and a S6 for my personal cell.  I have also had Android tablets, although budget level ones.\n\nAfter finding a good deal on this I-pad pro, I decided to get one.  One thing that Apple does well is the design of its products.  The I-pad chassis is sleek, sturdy, stylish and well made.  One complaint that I do have with the design is the lack of an external SD memory slot, although I do have that complaint with both Android and Apple phones as well.  External memory can be added though with the I-pad using a lightning plug thumb device, although that may prevent charging depending on the brand, or a wireless hard drive which is cheaper than buying the more expensive I-pads that have more memory.\n\nThe Apple OS, I don't think is as user friendly as the Android but most of the differences are pretty subtle as each revision of the OSs seem to mimic features of the competitors.  I do like the cleaner look and more customizable nature of Androids screens though.  Most of the apps are pretty similar although I like google maps better than the Apple version.\n\nThe pro is lightning quick with apps and much faster than any of my previous cheap Android tablets.  It so far has handled anything I have thrown at it with no issues at all, whether is its net surfing, playing videos, music, skyping or whatever.  I decided to get the pro over the regular I-pads so that I can use different accessories such as the pen.  I am currently using a generic brand Bluetooth keyboard which works just fine with the pro at a cheaper cost.  If you don't use the cell portion of the device, one thing I noticed is that I would get a pop-up indicating no sim card often.  I turned off the cell signal in the settings which helped but still get that pop-up from time to time.  I am not sure how to completely make that go away.\n\nThe tablet is lightweight and easy to carry around, although I don't dare use it without a protective case as I could see this easily cracking the screen if dropped.  Because of that, I also got the Apple care which gives an additional year of warranty and covers replacement with accidental damage.  For something as expensive as this, I think it is worth it.\n\nDisplay resolution is great and sharp.  The display is easy to read with apps and with any print.  Although I won't use the camera for picture taking, the camera is also very good for both pictures and video.  I regularly use this for Skype and the video is sharp and clear.  The speakers in this are better than any tablet or phone I have used so far.  I won't say they will blow you away but they are clear and loud considering the size.  I personally use an external Bluetooth speaker for most home use but the speakers are passable when on the road.  Battery life is also good at around 10 hours or so.\n\nMy one grip with Apple products is not about the quality but the price, I think the devices are a bit expensive as well as the accessories.  I found a good price on this one but I would not get one for the normal prices that these usually are.  Now that the new 10.5s that are out, maybe the prices will be more reasonable with these as these are pretty comparable to the 10.5 version in terms of specifications.  After using this for a while and not being a long-time fan of Apple, I can see why people love these products as they are well made and nicely design.  Although I do think they are pricey and have some OS features (or lack of) that I like better in the Android OS but overall this is a great tablet.\n\n4 stars"}

The plastic dust cover over the iPad itself looked very foggy or smudged and the iPad was mildly dusty, I don't see an option to submit a photo here but I will email it upon request. Even after being a little wary after opening the box once I plugged the \"new\" iPad in to the \"new\" charger it took an hour and 10 min to turn on. I then unplugged the iPad to apply a glass screen protector and when I plugged it back in the iPad would no longer charge. I thought maybe it was my outlet; it was not. I decided to plug the iPad into my iPhone charger to see if it would work and sure enough it did. This feedback is not meant to sound rude at all. I just don't like the fact that the iPad was described as new when I feel like it was refurbished or at least pre-owned. There is no reason for a brand new charger to stop working after about 2 hours of total charging. If I wanted to by a previously owned or refurbished iPad I would've bought one that was selling for less (but I wanted a new one). Hopefully this can be worked out, because I am not disappointed with the iPad in general, just the charger and description."}

I'm not really sure why Apple insists on using iOS.\n\nNegatives done.\n\nI got this as a birthday/graduation gift. A bit of background, I'm a college student (Geology Major), who was looking for a replacement for pencil and paper note taking and my aging, heavy Lenovo y50. The Lenovo y50 was originally designed as a semi-portable gaming laptop, weighing approximately 7-8 lbs, and 4 hours of battery life. It was designed to stay put on a desk with light travel. This is my 3rd and final year in university after transferring from a junior college. Taking notes with pencil and paper was my bread and butter since I was in elementary school.\n\nBoth of these things were hitting a brick wall. Pencil and paper note taking wasn't cutting it, as I was missing notes or information wasn't sticking. My Lenovo was really heavy after a long day at school and/or work and the wear and tear was starting to show on it. I was looking at a replacement; something light, powerful, good battery life stylus (5+ hours between charge with wifi, Bluetooth, and applications running) was a must, and good build quality. I first looked at the Surface Pro 3/4. A few friends had it and seemed like it ticked those boxes. However, after playing around with it, that for the price and usage, I realized that it was a laptop replacement. My girlfriend recommended her Samsung Tab A as well. While the battery was nice, the build quality left something to be desired. I also realized that I wanted a large enough tablet to have a comfy keyboard. The 3rd party Tab A keyboard was made tiny so that it would fit into a case for the tablet. I have tiny Donald Trump hands and I thought it.\n\nEnter the IPad Pro 9.7.\nIt isn't a replacement for your laptop, I don't care what Tim Cook says. It sure as a hell can be used in tandem and  supplements a laptop though. I went for the smaller size, because the 13\" inch one felt unwieldy for being an on-the-go item.\n\nBuild Quality: I can say that I'm not an Apple guy, but neither am I an Apple hater.  I knew an Apple machine by those smooth, machinned aluminum casings, comfy keyboards, superb touch pads, and that glowing Apple. I never got one though because for the price and spec sheet, they always seemed overpriced and underpowered. The same went for the iPhone; it looked aesthetically nice, but seemed like one paid more for the same. The iPad Pro is a beauty. This, along with my One Plus 3 phone, feel like some \"2001: A Space Odessy\" future tech. The screen is bright and color accurate; since buying the tablet, I have never turned off True Tone. The tablet is light, yet sturdy, comfy and unassuming. It's a confidently designed machine, never bragging about what it is, but it has gravitas. You know what else has gravitas? The battery. It will keep going for days. Apple says SOT is approximately 10+ hours, which I've gotten comfortably. I have to really push this thing to get from 100% to single digits by the end of the night. The speakers on this little guy are no slouch; it can get loud and clear, with no distortion. I'll admit, I was skeptical of having 2gb RAM and a dual-core 2.16GHz processor wouldn't be up to the task, but I'll handle it to Apple, they squeeze every last bit of processing power and memory cache they can.\n\nSoftware: IOS is an odd thing. I do think Andriod is currently the better mobile operating system, but there is something to be said about IOS simplicity. My screen is never cluttered, as my apps are packed neatly away in folders or on the home bar. The settings are simultaneously simple and informative, all without hunting. Siri is a nice, fun addition, for nothing too difficult like directions, weather, or where to eat. When apps are designed well, they usually preform better on IOS than Andriod. For example, Google Drive is intuitive on IOS and feels very much like the desktop version, with easy access to other apps. IOS has become my one stop shop for paper to digital to editing said paper. While I wish IOS was more customizable, I don't usually mind it.\n\nPersonal Usage (Why it's not \"Pro,\" more like \"NCAA\") : As I said earlier, I'm a college student. I take notes via Notability. I write essays via Google Docs/Microsoft Word. I watch videos on YouTube/Netflix/ Amazon Video. I do my shopping on Amazon/Etsy. I do have the Logitech Create keyboard case, because frankly the Smart Keyboard is silly. I use the Pencil for note taking mostly, but I have drawn with it; it's a nice stylus, but for what I use it for, it's pricey. Notability and my IPad are probably a huge reason for my grades getting a boost this semester. The recording function on the IPad and its usage in Notability is wonderful. The ability to take pictures with the camera and drop them into notes is a very nice function. The A9x processor and M9 coprocessor with 2gb RAM can handle multiple tabs open and I haven't noticed lag at all. I still close apps out of habit, but it's not necessary. I can read on the train, watch a dumb video on YouTube, and flip through my notes, all in one sitting.\n\nIf they really wanted this to be a pro machine, IOS needs to be gone, or at least heavily modified. IOS apps have nowhere near the full capability of a MacOS or WindowsOS. I would not want to edit video, work in AutoCAD, or make professional art on this machine. I really doubt the processing power is present in this machine. And for let's be real, I need my PC games. I can't play civilization 5 on this thing! This IPad feels like it wants to discover itself by doing casual art, but catching up on work, and then relaxing with Netflix at night.\n\nTLDR: A svelte, powerful machine, that's not a laptop replacement, nor a oversized phablet. It's designed for light work, entertainment, and art. Ladies and Gentlemen, the IPad Collegiate."}

I'm an artist and this one is plenty big for everything I want to do.\n\nThe colors and the screen clarity are top notch.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01CGXU0GM", "review": "The bad first: I can literally only complain about 2 things about this tablet. 1 Being how terrible the screen is for fingerprints. Like I work in a sanitized environment constantly washing my hands and my screen still gets absolutely disgusting. A fingerprint resistant screen protector can fix this. 2 Being that iOS arguably isn't the best OS for a PC Replacement. This is debatable to me because while the OS isn't aesthetically built to be a computer, it still does the same tasks. In fact to me, iOS is perfect in a tablet form factor. I use a tablet for media consumption and for school related things. iOS is straight to the point and less distracting with it's simpler format.\n\nDesign: 5/5 for design. This tablet feels amazing. I always appreciate great design language. Apple devices always feel so premium. Even though every year little changes between models, it just works. Better parts, thinner and lighter. That's all that ever really changes when it comes to design with Apple. The biggest addition has to be the speakers. Though found on the iPhone 7 and this tablets bigger brother, they were not on this guys predecessor, the Air 2. When you realize how thin this thing is yet how powerful it is, it truly blows your mind. It's thin but is so sturdy and tough. The aluminum is so hard to scratch or ding. The chamfered edges being the exception. I have a few nicks at the bottom of my tablet that I can't seem to place the blame on. But it's barely noticeable and if you use a case and screen protector you won't have this problem.\nI hate to put cases on such beautiful devices. So I risk it. Holding all this power in such a thin profile is mind boggling. It feels so good in the hand. Has the perfect feel and weight. The metal build does mean a lack of wireless charging but that is a rarity on any tablets and isn't even a iPhone feature. The worst thing I can say is aluminum absorbs temperature easy. So if it is cold, it will be like holding a slab of ice. No tablet feels as premium as this one. I have used most of them. The Pixel C is the closest competitor in design to this tablet.\nThe bezels are perfect. Just enough for me. My hands just sit perfect without accidentally touching the screen, though the palm rejection is amazing. The speaker placement is perfect. I hardly ever block the sound. Though laying it on a surface will muffle it a bit. The Touch ID is nearly perfect. Not to fast and works every time. I just wish it was a capacitive like the iPhone 7. That would make it feel even more premium then it is.\nThe camera hump tends to be everyone's gripe. Camera humps never bother me. Most people put cases on their devices anyways. With as powerful as the camera is, the hump is well worth it.\n\nCamera(s): 5/5 It's weird they put such a powerful camera lens on such a big device. It's awkward for most people to use a tablet for its camera. But the camera is so good, if I need to take a shot I'll use this over my phone if the tablet is conveniently near me. It adopts both cameras from the 6s. The back camera is 12MP and the front is 5MP. The front camera is important because Apple customers use FaceTime. It's nowhere as good as it could be but looks so much better then the 1.2MP found on the Air 2 and IPad Pro 12. Tablet manufacturers should worry more about the front camera anyways for better voice chat and selfies, sense those are easier to take and less awkward. You won't find a better camera on a tablet other then one on the Tab S3. But that's can be subject to opinion as well because I have always appreciated Apples less saturated shots.\nThe camera has HDR, shoots 4K, it shoots slow motion and burst shots.\n\nBattery: 4/5. The battery lasts long. I use this thing at least four hours a day and am never usually less then 60% when I go to charge it. That's with the volume up and the screen at 75% brightness. Games are the only thing you can do on this device that will drain it significantly. If your just typing or reading, setting the screen on a lower brightness will make this thing last forever. Longer then any other mobile device. It's one of the reasons I prefer my iPad over a laptop. The standby time is  ridiculously long. In just a few hours it will only lose a couple percent. It can go days with out being charged if you only pick it up here and there for basic tasks.\nThe reason it isn't 5/5 is only because in a world of quick charging, this thing takes longer to charge. Not terribly long at all. However the 12 inch pro has a quick charger sold separately that significantly improves charge times. Since this came out after the 12 inch model, I have to dock it a point for not including the tech in this one.\n\nMedia: 5/5 Your not going to get a better experience on arguably any mobile device, especially tablets. Yes the Tab S3 has HDR, which is amazing. However I really do prefer retinas over amoled for many reasons. Amoled screens can get brighter and are more saturated yes. But the iPads Quad HD Retina is so easy on the eyes. Especially having the true tone display and night shift mode. As someone who reads A LOT, I can finally read books on a tablet with out eye strain or feeling like I am ruining my eyes over time. The true tone display works wonders!\nThe screen is gorgeous. After years of seeing Apple devices with less pixel density screens then all the competition, it's finally nice to see them actually make a display that I really appreciate. To top off the media experience is the one feature that sets it above all the rest of the tablets when it comes to appreciating content; four stereo speakers. I always appreciate stereo speakers. All devices should have them. This tablet has four and they sound AMAZING. Their even better then Bluetooth speakers I've owned. It really is a special experience to watch movies on, play games on or listen to music on. It gets really loud and the sound has incredible depth and base. When you look at how slim it is, you wonder \"how does this thing make this much sound\".\nGames fly on this thing. The A9X is a very powerful SoC. Probably the most powerful chip behind the Snapdragon 835, 821 and the Apple A10. The 2 gigs of RAM is again, not a problem here. You wouldn't be able to tell at all based on how well games play on this thing.\n\nEveryday Use: 5/5 This is the best tablet to me for everyday use. With its long lasting battery, beautiful screen and speedy performance you would be hard pressed to find a device more capable. Though I prefer Android most of the time, iOS shines on a tablet. I use my tablet for media consumption and school work. With its simple design and power, it breezes through everyday tasks in a simple fashion.\n\nPower User: 4/5 For a power user this is still my favorite tablet. Sure the 12.9 incher has a bigger screen and double the ram which means better multitasking. However the 9.7 is much more portable and comfortable to use. In fact the only time I seen a noticeable difference in performance was when I was video editing. Most people aren't getting this device for video editing however and for the majority, this is the tablet for you.\nWith the Apple Pencil and keyboard case, you take things up a notch. Both are great products and make this the best main stream tablet for students and graphic designers.\nThe reason it isn't 5/5 is because of Windows 2 in 1 devices such as the Surface. These are still much better at performance, have a better keyboard and typing experience, and the styluses have more features. Their Windows 10 OS is much better suited for a power user. The iPad is a nice balance between power and simplicity however.\n\nComparison to the iPad Pro 12.9 inch: Yes the iPad Pro 12.9 has more RAM, a bigger screen and can charge faster if you buy the fast charger sold separately. The speakers are also slightly louder on the bigger model.\nHowever those differences are argued above, and I still would go for the 9.7 inch model if I was you.\nThe true tone display being my biggest reason. It definitely makes a difference on eye strain and presents content better. It also has P3 color gamut, which is the same as the iMac 5K. Colors are better on the smaller one.\nThis model has a way better camera, is available in gold and is MUCH more comfortable to use. Also the 12.9 has way bigger black bars when viewing movies and television shows.\nThis model is so much lighter, and easier to hold making it a better on the go option. At the price and size of the 12.9 inch, you would be better off buying a MacBook Air.\n\nConclusion: I am in love with this device. I originally wanted the 12.9 inch Pro because my brother had it on our contract. Previously I had a Mini 2. THANK GOD they were out of the 12.9 inch models and I went with this one. The 12.9 is really ungainly.\nThis thing is beautiful, powerful, practical and simple. Especially with unlimited data from Verizon, it truly is the best mobile experience. Also unlike a Android slab, I can use this one for years to come with out it worrying about slowing down and breaking due to terrible design. I easily recommend this. It is probably my favorite thing that I own. I use it everyday a lot. I watch movies and YouTube on it, type on it and read books on it everyday. I don't even want to use my phone when this thing is around. This device was crafter by the Gods themselves.\n\nUpdate: I have since acquired the 12.9 as well. I still really love my 9.7 more. It's screen is much prettier, it is comfortable in all situations and it feels and looks a lot better. You can't go wrong with either tablet. If you plan on multi-tasking a lot, keeping the tablet at home or only using it for games and movies then go for the 12.9. It's much better suited for these tasks. If you plan on reading a lot, carrying it to go and using it for everyday tasks, I would go for the 9.7\nThis update is simply meant to show I have experience with both, and didn't favor the 9.7 more because I was being biased."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01CGXU0GM", "review": "Plus: Very thin and lightweight case, excellent color reproduction, the speakers sound at the level of the macbook pro 15. Minus: The original covers are not very much: now the back and front cover from the epl can only be bought separately, and this design looks not very neat.\nAfter the unrealistically beautiful iPad mini Retina, which I served faithfully for three years, I did not think that the Apple could surprise me. But they could.\nThe first thing that catches your eye right after unpacking is, of course, the thickness. The device is absolutely weightless, very comfortable, noticeably more subtle than the first air, and even more so the second minicar.\nThose who wear a tablet in smart cover'e and, like me before buying, going through because of the bulging camera, I hasten to console: everything is perfectly magnetized, and the camera does not interfere.\nThe next wow effect occurred immediately after the first switch-on: the extended color range of the screen is visible to the naked eye without any comparisons. The colors are just very, very good.\nThe device was bought for two purposes: reading and drawing. Therefore, the natural (hi amoleda) color rendition was critical.\nWell, and a little bit about interacting with apple pencil. To work with this accessory on the tablet should be turned on bluetooth. When you draw, the device is discharged much more quickly than during normal use, but even if you draw a whole day, until evening it will live completely calmly.\nIn the usual mode of use is not inferior to other eplplan.\n\nIn general, the impressions of buying are the best: it is a beautiful tablet that does absolutely everything that is required of it (function with work in two windows is priceless when reading foreign literature: two-thirds of the screen for a book, a third for a dictionary, and drawing is also very nice and convenient ), Looks just fine (and even the bulging camera does not spoil it, although, of course, without it it would be quite good) and once again proves that in the production of tablets with Apple for a very long time few people will be able to compete."}

It won't let me add removable memory was complaint #1 and the Air II has rather crude stylus support was complaint #2.\n\nThe Galaxy Tab A I love. Pen support is great. The quick note feature where you scribble on the screen, even when it's locked, and it saves it, is pure genius. The stylus that hides in the case is too small to be comfortable for extended usage but I bought the $39 Wacom stylus that's pencil size and it's great. That's $39 Apple, not $99. And neither stylus needs to be charged. I can add micro SD memory. I can scribble a search argument into Yahoo, it converts it to text and does the search. It's accuracy doing this is better than my poor typing. I can hover over a foreign word and it will translate it. The biggest downside is it doesn't let me answer my iPhone.\n\nPen support for the iPad Pro is after the fact software dependent while it's a base function for the Tab A. Maybe someday Apple will catch up.\n\nVery disappointed in the iPad Pro and Apple Pen combination. Does very little more than the iPad Air II and it doesn't do that very well despite the exorbitant price. Maybe it's time for a Samsung phone."}

The iPad was received, and seemed to be okay. When opening it up, that when the problems started. This was very clearly an open box item. The plastic sleeve on the iPad was scuffed, as if it was opened tossed aside and re wrapped on the the iPad. It was also clear the it had been peeled open. It was also transparent clear plastic, the new iPad comes in an opaque plastic. The charging block, also did not have the plastic wrap on it. It was also only a 10W charger that seemed light. iPad pros come with a 12W charger. Also, it was missing Apple in the \"Designed BY APPLE in California Assembled in China\" it only said \"Designed in California Assembled in China\" the adapter was clearly not original. Another thing of note, was that the iPad was completely dead, EVERY Apple device i have ever received, I work in IT and deployed 100s of devices over several companies, has had some sort of a charge, even one i bought as spares that sat on a shelf for months before use. The box also have blurry faded looking text on it. Everyone know apple is alla bout looks a presentation. The box was also clearly not original. The iPad didn't even get opened or turned on, just repackaged and sent back. I then went to Best Buy to buy a brand new on. The extra $90 was worth my peace of mind that i got what i paid for. I wish I would have taken pictures, but I couldn't get it packaged back up fast enough."}

I didn't know how the package was going to arrive or be what I have ordered.  I normally buy all my electronics from Best Buy.  When I went to Best Buy, they wanted 1000 dollars for this IPad.  I thought to myself, I'm going to go on Amazon to see if it is any cheaper and it was.  After debating for a little while, I decided to take a chance and purchase it!\n\nWell, it came yesterday!  I was pleasantly surprised that it was what I have ordered and came in one piece!  Now on, if I want to order another electronic, I am going to have to remember Amazon!\n\nThanks!  A happy, satisfied customer here!!!  :-)"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B01CGXU0GM", "review": "My favourite device of all time. The perfect device for anyone, especially an artist, on the go. You can unlock its drawing tablet potential with the Apple Pencil, but the Pencil by 53 also works pretty well for a fraction of the price. It has the power, speed, versatility, and portability of a laptop but slicker. It can even be connected to computers to be used as a traditional drawing tablet! I even got a clamshell keyboard case and it feels just like a traditional netbook but looks like a mini MacBook. Since it arrived, I've hardly ever put it down. And especially after getting the Apple Pencil, I'm hardly seen without either. It arrived on time, it works nearly perfectly. The only thing making this review a 4star is that there was a flaw in the screen that interferes with my drawing but it is only a minor inconvenience considering it works perfectly fine for just about everything else. And the flaw is only visible when the screen is all a solid dark color."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01CGXU0GM", "review": "If you love Apple stuff you are going to love this.  If you hate Apple, you will hate it, but if you are on the fence I strongly suggest you try it out, and you will love it.  There is no comparison between an Android tablet and an Apple.  Even the top of the line Android tablet is not nearly as responsive or reliable as an Apple iPad.  I tried to hate Apple, I really did, and I went with Android, but after trying an iPhone and a tablet compared to my Android I realized that I was only punishing myself.  Who cares if Apple gets to approve all apps on the app store, they actually do that to ensure that the apps don't crash, leak memory or have viruses in them.  That's fine with me.  There really isn't anything that I could do on my Android that I can't do on my iPad.  That said, I don't jailbreak my iPad, and I pay for the apps that I use.  If you are looking for a way around that then the Android is significantly easier.  But, I love the interface on the iPad.  When I touch the screen and move something, it instantly follows me, with absolutely no perceivable delay.  I was amazed at how I had convinced myself that my Android did that, and just how tolerant I was of the poor user interface performance.  But, now that I have this pro, I won't look back.\n\nAs for the size, it is perfect for me.  I went to the store, and the full sized pro is just too big.  It is like a full sized laptop screen.  This is smaller, it is what I consider a tablet.  It has all the performance of the full sized, running desktop quality apps and games with absolutely no issue.  I opted for the 32GB model, because I don't load up too much on it, but now that I can see what it does I am wishing I went with more memory, especially now that they have 256GB available.\n\nEven if you are an Apple hater, I strongly suggest you try one of these out.  They are quite more expensive than a normal Android tablet, but try it out and you will quickly see why.  The feel is solid and rugged, the case is a work of art, perfection.  The user interface experience is second to none.  I dare any Apple hater to use this, and still try to say that they hate apple with a straight face.\n\nPROS: Well built, super fast, ideal sized, light weight, and batter lasts for days for me.\n\nCONS:  Price is high, and I cannot upgrade the storage size.  But that is it."}

My beautiful case arrived in perfect condition and I have been enjoying using it although the sketching programs seem to have a somewhat steeper learning curve than I expected. That said I am finding this to be a lovely new toy (well for me all electronic gear are toys) and I am looking forward to many years of fun with it. My early iPad air works quite well, but with a 16 Gb hard drive I was finding it constraining. I will be traveling very soon and plan to use it to do sketches during my trip."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01CGXU0GM", "review": "Pretty much as we expected.  It has a terrific battery...much preferable to my Kindle Fire.  The photos really jump out at you, and since we can use our phone as a hotspot, there was no need to get a 4G and purchase another phone contract.  Another positive, as with all Apple products, is our phones are completely compatible being iPhones, and we can sync calendars, messages, music, documents and other items.  It is just slightly larger than the Kindle Fire I had been using to read the paper, and I welcome the increased screen size without needing to go to a 12 inch iPad, which would have been much harder to drag around.  We purchased a nice leather case (ProCase) with a document pocket, allowing it to stand up conveniently when reading on a table or desk.  There are also four speakers which generate good sound, that allows us to use it as a player without hooking it up to other equipment.  While we have compared the iPad Pro 9.7 to our Kindles, there is no getting around the cost difference.  The Kindles are way cheaper, so remember that.  All in all we are very pleased with our purchase and expect to use it for a long time."}

However, one can only appreciate what Apple has done with it once you experience it under different light environments.\nWith \"True Tone\", the display \"adjusts\" itself to \"blend\" with the environment to give you a more natural experience. It all sounds too fancy until you actually use it. In our office we have \"bright white\" lights, and if you're looking at a page, it seems all good, not too yellow, not too blue. However, back with the iPad Air 2, whenever we got to bed time where we have \"warm white\" lights, until now it was obvious the screen was too white, and quite bothersome. So now, it is a much better experience, and I'm extremely pleased with that feature."}

The accessories are very expensive, the keypad/cover is a must have, The keypad is as good as my Mac Air notebook, $150, way overpriced.

A big problem with the pencil is that there is no proper way to anchored to the ipad, i'm trying an aftermarket accessories that went into the charging port but I'm afraid to ruin the port and the charging interface is ridiculous three-quarter's of an inch long and easy to lose.

However, I now know that Apple refuses to repair any item that has been refurbished or altered by another company.  If the seller doesn't offer a refund or replacement, I am out $465, plus the cost of buying another iPad. Buyer beware of \"refurbished\" deals. They may be too good to be true for a reason."}

Anyway, this review is for the 9.7, slate, 256mb version of the iPad Pro . Honestly, if you have an IPad Air 2, this is only an upgrade in terms an easier connection to a keyboard, memory and the ability to use the Apple Pencil. It's not a laptop and in my opinion it's faster than the iPad Air 2, but not by much. I don't care about the keyboard, because the touchpad works fine for what I need it for. For things that require a laptop, I have one. I like the extra memory and Pencil feature, which pretty sums it up my needs. It's light, looks great and has superior quality as would be expected."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01CGXU0GM", "review": "This was an upgrade from my iPad4 from 2012. A couple things immediately noticed when I unpacked it was how light it was, and having a smaller border around the screen. The iPad Pro is deceptively light, as if it should be a heavier device based on my experience with my previous iPad. It's also thinner on the sides of the screen, making for a narrower model in contrast to the iPadv4. Having said that, the actual video screen itself is identical in size to the previous generation iPads. I intend on rarely using my new iPad to take pictures, but the camera is leagues better than the version 4 camera, both front and back. I also like the split screen option on the iPad Pro, since I can put my Cisco Jabber IM client off to one side of the screen and continue to web browse. I also purchased the Apple Pencil with the new iPad and downloaded the \"Goodnotes\" application from the app store. The app made a great first impression, with handwriting resolution that rivals a fine tip pen or pencil in real life. I like that it's Bluetooth versus capacitive, since I can rest the rest my hand on the screen and write normally, a feature not possible with capacitive writing devices. Being Bluetooth, the battery life on the Apple Pencil isn't great, but it recharges from the iPad Pro lightning port in like 5 or 6 minutes, which is pretty impressive.\n\nVideo Storage and Playback:\nIn 2012 I would've been against storing my movie collection with iTunes cloud, but having lost a few hard drives at home since then I kinda like the idea of Apple being responsible for my data, since they are more data storage resilient than I can ever afford to be at home. Even so I purchased the 256GB model so I can store a healthy volume of movies and music for when I travel, without being starved on storage space for the other applications. My iPad 4 was a 16GB storage and nearly half of the storage space was unusable even after a factory reset of the device with nothing on it; a mistake I won't repeat with future tablets or phones.\n\nBattery life:\nIn watching a 2 hour movie on battery power, the percentage went down about 15%, which isn't bad.\n\nApplication switching and overall performance:\nNoticeably faster than my iPad4. I still close unneeded programs when I am no longer using them, a habit I picked up from my other Apple device usage, but I don't notice a performance hit when 20+ applications are open at the same time on the iPad Pro, in contrast to the iPad4 version.\n\nAll in all it was a good choice and I think it future proofs my device when iOS 11, 12, and beyond come out. My iPad4 is noticeably slower since upgrading to iOS 10, so I anticipate it reaching its end of life in the next year or 2 worth of updates."}

The \"cellular\" feature is garbage.\n\nI tried uploading multiple images (50+ images) to my Google Drive, that does not work in Camera Roll. Then using the Google Drive App to do the upload, the app crashes. The iPad definitely does disappoint. I still wish I made the 128 GB buy without the cellular.\n\nI am making an update, here.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01CGXU0GM", "review": "I picked up an iPad2 back in 2011.  It has done everything I've ever wanted it to do. Movies, email, browsing, remote control, music, photo editing. To be honest there was no need to replace until the iPad Pro came out.  I did not move past iOS 7.1.2 since that was the last non-retina iOS.  I still have my iPad2 at work as a basic utility tool and it works great.  The battery still lasts all day with constant use.\n\nWhen I saw the 9.7 inch iPad Pro I knew it was time to update.  This iPad is light, but feels solid in the hands.  The build quality is stunning. I got the slim JETech case for it and it is still thin & light and protected from normal daily hazards.  The screen on the iPad Pro is a huge jump up from what I was used to, and I have come to like the TrueTone screen very much (changing the white balance depending on daylight/indoor lighting).  It's easier to hold for long periods of time (over the iPad 2).  The camera is also finally useful.  The iPad2 camera was complete garbage. The iPad Pro camera is doing a great job.  I'd say it's the first iPad camera worth using.\n\nTouch ID is so much better to login with and I like the idea of fingerprint log-in protection vs the old 4-digit pass code of old. If you have an older iPad you will love this one for it's form factor, build and speed. I'm also using it as an external monitor on my MBP for editing (connected via USB3) since it has the expanded sRGB screen and my projects are 1080p.  This is a great version of the iPad and won't disappoint."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B01CGXU0GM", "review": "I love Ipads for what they are but Apple marketing continues to try to make them out to be more than they really are. This is a great iPad but hardly \"Pro\" (whatever that means in Apple ad-speak) and I think for the majority of users functionally no improvement over a recent iPad Air.\n\nA such I would find this hard to recommend for most people over the current iPad Air and the next Air, supposedly coming in March, will reportedly have the AX 9 CPU as in the current 9.7 pro or perhaps the AX 10 (that will probably be the pro model). Finally getting more than 16gb RAM is liberating, particularly since Netflix will supposedly be allowing some off line viewing. In truth iPad apps have to be able to run on the large installed base of slower CPUs so I have read technical reviews indicating that Apple is in a bind touting the benefits of faster iPad CPUs. App developers can not afford to abandon platforms as Apple continues to do (e.g ports on the new MacBook Pro, no headphone jack on the iPhone 7).\n\nCompared to my early model Ipad, which was circling the digital drain, the performance boost is remarkable for web browsing, but so is that of the current Ipad air. The faster processor allows access to splt screen, useful for the limited cutting and pasting possible in iOS. If you tether/clone your Ipad to your desktop/laptop again I am not sure the AX9 CPU will be a huge improvement over the CPU in the current iPad air. Although I use the front facing camera for Skype I almost never use the rear camera unless I need a snapshot and the iPad is in my hands at the time but the images seem in the ballpark for the generic digital Instamatic quality of cell phones and tablets.\n\nAs Apple does not allow a mouse/cursor (yet) in iOS I have never been able to use an iPad with any keyboard or stylus as a laptop replacement when traveling or for daily use, others may disagree, particularly for complex text or interacting with complex web pages some of which that I have to use do not even trigger the onscreen keyboard for text entry. Although I can see how the larger iPad pro could be useful for graphics pursuits it too is not a laptop replacement (and is too big for how I use an iPad). Honestly, I would invest in a Surface Pro (horrors) rather than the larger iPad pro but that opinion is just based on having used both of them.\n\nSo why did I buy this instead of the iPad Air? I had a few Amazon gift cards lying around and decided to splurge because, as noted, my old iPad was giving signs it planned to die soon and I did not want to wait until March for the new iPad Air--which I would do if I did not immediately need an iPad replacement."}

I was debating getting the mini, but made the jump to the 9\" without regret.  I use it with the apple wireless keyboard, and use the logitech Keys-to-go keyboard when traveling.

I've owned a couple of MacBooks (Recently reviewed the MacBook Pro 2016 with touch-bar ), the iPhone 4S, iPhone 5, iPhone SE, iPhone 6, iPhone 6S and iPhone 7 plus and now the iPad Pro 9.7\"\n\nThe minority of upgrades along this ownership have been big changes with some flaws and some positives. Moving to the Retina MacBook Pro from a regular 13\" MacBook pro was a huge one. The iPhone 6 from the 4s and 5 was a huge change in my life\n\nAfter thinking about the iPad Pro 9.7\", it's hard to say whether it's a revolutionary upgrade. I'm leaning toward \"no,\" but I could change over time definitely it's useful having one though. The reason I got rid of the 12.9\" model was that it was way too big to carry and work with, I haven't seen anything like that before and I was unable to buy the Apple Pencil at that time because I thought it was over-priced and not useful. Now that I have a true iPad Pro *and* the Apple Pencil thanks to the Black Friday sale, I'm more then happy to leave a review on this product.\n\nSome things I like:\n\nThe sound quality: As I'm a music lover I'll talk about the sound first. Apple has finally caught up with other brands who give you stereo sound by default even on lower end tablets. The speakers on the Pro 9.7\" are not as mind-blowing as the speakers on the 12.9\", but they're still better than any other iPad that came before.\n\nPencil: Let's talk about something NEW Wow, this is so good. AGAIN it isn't as good as on the iPad Pro 12.9\", but it's still very much as close to a realistic writing experience. The quality of the experience depends highly on the quality of app you're using, and I can say I really like Adobe Sketch and the pencil works wonders on that app. and for taking notes in class this pencil does the job. but I must say I had a bad experience with the Apple Notes app like a few other users here, and I agree with others that it's Interesting how a native app does worse than a 3rd party app on what is supposed to be a killer feature.\n\nBattery life: No Words better then anything else !\n\nSpeed: Lightning fast for everything. I can't tell how much faster it really is than the iPad Pro 12.9\" in terms of using it while standing or carrying it around, technically the benchmarks put some other branded tablets ahead.\n\nThe things I didn't like:\n\nBattery charge time: Still slow! Apple needs to up their charging game if they want to remain competitive. I'm used to my Apple products taking a significant charge in a short period of time, but it's just not the case with the iPad Pro.\n\nMultitasking: Apple really needs to find a way for any two apps to multitask. What about having two instances of Safari open side-by-side? Ability to instantly swap sides? All missing, It should be something like multitasking on the MacBook Pro 2016\n\nTouchID speed: Still a first-gen sensor (think iPhone 5S... old, right?), which is much much slower and less accurate compared to the sensor on my iPhone 6S.\n\nOverall, I like the iPad for what it is. I think around $800 after tax (when I bought). I have a right to expect a bit more progress on certain items. iPads were already expensive enough at $500, but they need to do a little bit better of a job justifying the \"Pro\" part of the \"iPad Pro.\". Especially when we can get a maxed out laptop for $800 ( Not Apple )\n\nI have Included some Pictures which you can check to see how it looks as well as the camera quality :)"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01CGXU0GM", "review": "I was hesitant to invest in such a pricey tablet, but the iPad Pro is the best tablet on the market. I've had a Samsung Galaxy Tab A in the past and it was nice, but it in no way compares to the Pro. My favorite part of the Pro and main reason for buying it was to learn how to do brush calligraphy. The iPad and the Apple Pencil do not disappoint. I would highly recommend this tablet over any others on the market if you are a designer, creator or artist. This paired with the Apple Pencil is by far the best product for digital hand-drawn or calligraphic designs.\n\nFor those of you looking for a solid tablet to use as a companion to your laptop or desktop computer, again the iPad Pro is the way to go. It doesn't replace a computer in many regards, but it definitely allows for a lot of the wear and tear to be taken off of one. Besides doing calligraphy and other design related things on my Pro, I enjoy reading, watching tv and using it to write papers and complete other school projects. If you're a designer and need the full Adobe Creative Suite, I wouldn't recommend giving up your laptop for the Pro. But if you want a solid tablet that can take some of the stress off of your everyday computer, look no further."}

As for protecting the iPad, I did drop the iPad already and it was perfectly fine, so I'm hoping it will protect it from future falls, which for me are bound to happen.  The Wake/ Sleep feature works great.  I thought it had quit on me, but it turns out I had turn off the Lock/Unlock or it was reset with the update.  Either way it works great.  It is true tot he color, I wished the front cover was the same color as the back, which is a transparent gold color tint.  Over all I love it, it looks great on my gold iPad, very classy.  I also like that the inside is also a gold color not the gray of many other cases."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01CGXU0GM", "review": "Let me start this review by saying that I've owned a lot of tech and a lot of Apple products. iPad-wise, I've owned the iPad 3rd generation, iPad mini 2, and iPad Air 2. For this review, I'll probably do most of my comparisons to the iPad Air 2.\nThis iPad is honestly perfect. The four speakers are incredibly loud and clear. Apple fixed the annoying vibrate issue that plagued the iPad Air 2 that was caused by the speakers. While this iPad is the same dimensions as the former, it feels sturdier. The screen is absolutely gorgeous. I didn't think it could have much improvement from the last one, but it really is. Apple included a new feature called True Tone display, which uses four sensors to make the screen match the color temperature of the room. The cameras are the same as my iPhone 6S, and you can tell. My mom says I look so much clearer when I FaceTime with my iPad now. Speaking of the screen, I had a horrible problem with my iPad Air 2. Without a case, there were some moments if I held it with one hand that the distortion spots on the screen would appear from the pressure. The vibrate and screen issue I thought were from it being so thin, but Apple fixed both of those issues with the iPad Pro 9.7\".\nThis iPad is also incredibly fast. Again, I didn't think there would be THAT much improvement from the previous generation, but I was wrong. It flies at everything I throw at it. My MacBook is a 2012 model that is showing its age. It is painful to use. Because my new iPad Pro has 128GB, I'm probably going to use THIS as my primary computing device.\nThe iPad Air 2 isn't a bad device, but you can definitely tell that THIS one is superior. It feels better in hand. The screen looks amazing. The speakers are loud and immersive. The battery life is better.\nIf you're a tech lover, buy this iPad. You will be much happier with your investment. I typed this review with a Logitech keys-to-go keyboard on my iPad Pro 9.7\"."}

Whoever said that they got a fake one, must of gotten this warehouse mistaken with some place else ware! Definitely will be buying from this seller again, and you guys should too. Awesome iPad, amazing photos, and much more that I didn't even expect from the device. I got the 9.7inch 32 GB one and I'm thoroughly impressed. Best iPad to buy! Don't get the 12inch one if you want an amazing camera because, it doesn't have it!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01CGXU0GM", "review": "I bought an iPad Pro for school to use as an engineering student and it has been by far one of the most sound investments that I have ever made for school. The note taking apps that integrate the Apple Pencil into them are fantastic (The top two that I found were Goodnotes and Notability but I prefer Notability) and the keyboard that Apple sells as a 2 in 1 smart cover is pretty useful as well but a tad bit expensive for what it actually is. I have a lot of classmates that drool over me being able to have all my notes in one place and not have to carry around a different notebook for each class and how well it has helped with me being organized. But this is something that could be attained with any tablet for that matter. The reason why I chose to buy an iPad Pro over the other available tablets is because it syncs well with my Mac and my iPhone phenomenally as well as being reliable. If you are a fan of Apple products then you would be a fan of the iPad Pro, for whatever use to chose to put it to. But for me personally, this is a complete life saver when it comes to school. All my notes are in one place, they're backed up and synced to my iPhone, Mac, and iPad, I don't have to take my computer to class anymore or even to campus for that matter, and it's a lot more light weight than carrying around a million notebooks! All in all this is another Apple product that can be enjoyed by people who like what Apple offers it customers and this iPad offers a lot more than just your traditional iPad."}

I got this tablet tablet right around the same time IOS 10 came out and I must say, the combination of the new features of IOS 10 and the speed of this tablet are very fun and convenient! A little nervous at first when I started using this tablet? The battery life was way short of expections the first couple of weeks? It would only last about 6 or 7 hours of usage out of the box, but now I can use it all day and still have more then enough battery at the end of the day, i think it may have been what was going on the background with IOS 10 for awhile then it was the actual tablet, because it's fine now, for sure! It will last the entire day and then some! I've had apple products for years, love them of course! I'm not a real fan of the color gold, but I wanted to give it a shot. When I first seen the gold backside on this tablet I was blown away! It's a pretty cool color! I really like it! And the 32 GB is plenty for me! THANKS APPLE! Happy customer yet again :)."}

My favorite aspect is how you can actually feel the deep sound from the speakers. It gives you a wonderful listen experience for not only music, but movies as well.\n\nThe performance is great also. It responds very well with little lag with multiple apps running. I was worried about this at first because i love multitasking and i tend to forget to close out apps.\n\nThe battery life surpassed my expectations. I am on it for quite a bit during the day and it lasts about three days before I need to charge.

I do not like the idea of a monopoly on technologies, and so I do support and love products like the Surface Pro. The bottom line is that the iPad Pro is faster than it has any right to be, responsive beyond belief, and the battery lasts forever! While it may be running iOS, there are still plenty of apps to make up for the lack of a computer-style operating system. It is slightly easier to do things like word processing and video editing on something like the Microsoft Surface Pro, simply because you are not inhibited by the mobile operating system. Regardless, I would still give the iPad Pro the edge simply because it is so consistent in being responsive, lightning-fast, and doing exactly what you want it to. The Apple Pencil really should come with the iPad Pro because it is possibly the most impressive aspect of the whole Pro package. I have never used a more responsive stylus, with virtually zero lag, that actually captures exactly what I am writing or drawing. Apple may be last to join the bandwagon but they have once again, as usual, been the first to perfect the technology."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01CGXU0GM", "review": "Loving my iPad Pro"}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B01CGXU0GM", "review": "Just to preface this review, I owned the 9.7 iPad Pro before I got the big guy:  the 12.9.  Like many, I was convinced by the countless online reviews all basically saying, \"Buy the 9.7.  The 12.9 is nice and big, but the 9.7 is a far more polished product:  Truetone display, better cameras, more portable, etc. etc.  Wait until a few more models come out and the tech has caught up to buy this monster.''\n\nSo I bought the 9.7, and it was awesome.  I loved it, and fully intended to keep it and continue using it.  Then, after 2 months, it was stolen.  I got an insurance check that covered the loss and thought, why not try out the 12.9?  Basically free at this point.  If I didn't like it I could just return it and get the 9.7 again, nbd.\n\nSo I got the 12.9 128gb with WIFI and LTE.  And it was even better--so much better in fact, that you couldn't pay me to go back to the 9.7.  Ladies and gentlemen, this thing is a bonafide game changer.  The smaller version hardly compares. Shop at the right place and you can get this for virtually the same price too.  Think of it this way:  you're shopping for a TV, and the salesman comes up to you and says, \"We've got a 47' flat screen plasma for $630, but If you want, I'll sell you this 82' Plasma for just 40$ more.\"  It's a very easy choice to make.  Go big, or go home.  Take advantage of the fact that the bigger format has not yet taken off, and you can find it discounted down to the price of the standard size iPad Pro because this is a trend that will not last.\n\nTo anyone that says the 12.9 is bulky/not portable, that is simply untrue.  It's as thin as an iPhone and barely weighs more than a stack of printer paper of the same thickness.  Whoever says, \"you might as well just be carrying a laptop everywhere,\" that is a woeful exaggeration.\n\nThe Apple Pencil, with either model, is a must buy accessory.  This addition is what sets the iPad Pro apart from any other tablet on the market.  It has a more natural, tactile feel than any stylus on the market (looking at you Surface and Galaxy Note), but it was made for the bigger version.  With the bigger version, the Apple Pencil is a legitimate tool, and a great one at that.  With the smaller version, the functionality of the pencil feels more like a toy--very cool, but more limited just by nature of the smaller work space, like an elementary school desk V. full size executive wrap-around.\n\nNow, to those who say, \"The camera's not as good on the bigger model, and the iSight camera's definitely not as good.\"  Look, just use your smart phone.  I know you have one.  I moonlight as a photographer, so take it from me, it is worth taking photos or video On some other device and having this massive, beautiful screen to edit them.  Plus, you don't want to be 'that guy' walking around holding a tablet in the air trying to get your master shots; no one will take you seriously.  Spielburg's not shooting his next block buster on any tablet, no matter how good the camera, and if you're an artist, you want the bigger view finder; the extra 4mp makes no difference.\n\nAs for the rest, the sound is not only louder, it's also better.  Size-wise, the bigger model actually feels better in terms of ergonomics--fits perfectly and securely across your lap in absence of a table or working surface and eliminates need to balance on a knee, squeeze your legs together, or even hold in the air, as was my experience on the smaller model, which makes the argument that \"it's just too big to be comfortable holding for long periods of time,\" a moot point.\n\nBattery life is better.  Bigger screen makes anything related to reading, watching, gaming, editing, typing, etc, better on the 12.9.  With the smaller model, the on screen keyboard is an awkward size, too big to use your thumbs like a smart phone/too small and cramped to type as with a traditional keyboard, and even the blue tooth keyboards (I've used apple and Logitech) feel small, cramped, and inefficient (unless you have very small hands I suppose).  This was one of the biggest limitations I had with the 9.7.  In contrast, with the larger one, the onscreen keyboard is big enough to get meaningful work done if you need to, past the capacity of quick text messages, and if you opt for a keyboard, the ones built for the 12.9 are basically the same scale as your typical laptop, offering a very easy transition.  My opinion:  get the Pencil for sure, but give the onscreeen one a chance before spending that extra 100$ on a keyboard case, which effectively doubles the size of this sleek machine.  I bought one at the same time I got the iPad, thinking I'd use it.  I don't.  Like, at all, and I type all the time.  But the onscreen keyboard is good enough that having another keyboard is simply redundant.  I typed this entire review with no help from a Bluetooth keyboard.  My guess, Apple developed the smart keyboards because they knew people would ask, and pay the extra money for them, not because they thought people would need them.\n\nSo-in summary, there's no arguing, both sizes are great products, but  you're not getting full \"Pro\" capabilities in the device unless you get the 12.9.\n\nDo yourself a favor. Get the 12.9, NOT the 9.7."}

I must say that this is worth every penny and probably the best tablet currently on the market. This baby won't be obsolete for many years. With the money I saved on buying this off Amazon I put towards the very expensive Apple keyboard ($150.) Honestly it's worth it. There's nothing I hate more than Bluetooth keyboards. Apple's addition of the smart connector was genius. You're gonna pay a little more for Apple but at least you get what you pay for!"}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B01CGXU0GM", "review": "I had an early iPhone, an incredible device which started a revolution.  But Android seems to have passed them by in terms of just about everything (except price).\n\nI purchased this iPad out of necessity.  Certain specialized applications needed for my industry are only available for the latest iOS devices, and I also needed a way to validate websites I design freelance, which have received a lot of tech support calls that ended up being caused by iOS-9 doing some stupid things in the background (confirmed by this purchase and testing with it).\n\nFor review of the iPad PRO verses other iOS devices, about all I can say is I like having all the memory (since I can't add a uSD like any Andriod device) and one of my apps requires the iPencil, which is only for iPad PRO right now.\n\nReview against Android devices, like the Samsung tablets, it's no contest.  Except that the Androids don't run the very specialized apps I need, I prefer them in every way, especially being able to add/upgrade memory, and pay about 1/2 the price for the same power and functionality.  \"Retina\" display is objectively no better than the latest Androids.  (Did you know that the iPhone's display is the same exact specs as the Galaxy S4, and made by Samsung?).  Siri doesn't seem to work as well as OK-Google for my use (I didn't have to train it).  For that matter, the new Cortana in Windows-10 (Anniversary update) is even better than OK-Google, putting Siri in a solid 3rd-place (then there is Amazon's Alexix, which I haven't tried).  Then the native spell-check.  At least Android gives me the option of going back to my original spelling (a dotted line under corrected text).  Not so iOS, if you don't purposefully select your original text, it gets auto-co-wrecked for you, and you have to proofread/hunt/replace.\n\nReview of the iPad PRO against itself, it probably does it's best, because of the great speakers and iPencil support (separate review of the over-priced iPencil).  Biggest problem is that iOS9.3.x acts like a pig once it connects to the internet, constantly and rapidly crawling (like a search-engine) sites in your favorites and history for content updates (even when browser is not running) as well as looking for \"iOS Optimized\" websites by calling specific filenames that don't exist otherwise (i.e. \"apple-touch-icon.png\" and several variants) putting load on your dataplan and generating tons of 404's with website servers, which is interpreted by a lot of security software as aggressive probing, and can lead to host or IP denial (as my website clients started to complain when they got their first iOS 9.3 updates).  iOS 10 update was just released last week.  I'm holding off until I hear the first reports from others, so I can compare with my server logs what new probes it will be up to.\n\nI realize this review isn't going to influence a YES or NO purchase decision.  This is my experience with the iPadPRO so far.  Price for what you get is the biggest hit.  If it was price-comparable to a Samsung tab with comparable power and features, it would still be one-star behind.  (It seems that almost all of my \"not helpful\" review ratings involve polarizing brand-name product comparisons.  Hmmmm.)"}

This device is ideal for anyone wanting a smaller, lighter substitute for his or her laptop.\n\nDisplay:\nDiscusses features related to the screen and display quality\n iPad Pro has a 9.7 retina screen display with 2048x1536 resolution giving the user exceptional detail.\n Colors are vivid and true to real life.\n The screen size is perfect for most users.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B01CGXU0GM", "review": "Just merely hours before I boarded my evening flight out of Seattle, with my final summer paycheck in hand, I purchased an Apple iPad Pro. When I walked into the Apple store that day I was looking for a product that would enhance my educational experience at Baylor. After taking notes on paper all throughout high-school, I figured that it was time to make a change. Having never owned a tablet, I probably fell for every sales pitch in the book that day because I not only walked out of the store with an iPad Pro but also an Apple Pencil and a Smart Keyboard. Although this came out to be a hefty purchase ringing out at $1299, I felt as if I had to stay loyal to the Apple brand. I do highly recommend this product to individuals participating in higher level education because of its immense upsides with few downsides.\nThe upsides to this particular product come primarily from the additional products that I purchased to pair with it. To begin, the Apple Pencil allows the consumer to be able to take the highest of quality digital notes within a variety of apps available in the App Store. Whether you're looking to annotate PDF document or edit a photo on Adobe Photoshop, the Apple Pencil gives you the personal touch. I primarily use the OneNote application to take notes because it syncs with my Microsoft 365 Account, which allows me to have my notes on all my devices. Carrying onto the Smart Keyboard, this addition allows one to type as if they were using a traditional keyboard on a tablet. When I first got my iPad I struggled typing with the touch screen keyboard, but as Ive transitioned to the Smart Keyboard I have been able to efficiently type emails, documents, as well as notes.\nWith all those upsides I have noticed some discouraging aspects to this product. One of the marketed features of this product was the ability to transfer your hand-written notes to typed documents. Ive downloaded many apps that claim that their app can fulfil this claim and Ive figured out that this claim is a bit of a stretch. Many of these apps aren't fully developed so the success rate of the transfer is very low. As I have taken notes on my new iPad for the past four weeks of school, Ive come to the conclusion that its not worth trying to convert my notes to text. Its proven to be a disappointment. If you're looking to enhance your educational experience, I recommend this product as you're okay with getting a little less than what is expected in the product."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B01CGXU0GM", "review": "With over 30 years in the IT industry, I had been using Samsung Galaxy android tablets for years, in fact, I wrote my first two sci-if novellas on them.  By the time my Galaxy tab 12.2 died, it was running so slow, had no battery life even after I swapped the battery out and there was not much hope in Samsung getting the most recent versions of their OS on that device any time soon.  I had been using an iMac (over Windows or Ubuntu, which I love) as my main computing platform and needed something mobile and not a laptop.  I looked at everything on the market (chromebook, Apple, Android, Windows) and for what I need it to do as well as how it integrates into my current computing environment, it came down to the iPad Pro 9.7 vs the iPad Pro 12.9.  Having used a screen size of 12.2, I was concerned about the iPad Pro 9.7 size, but spec wise, it seemed superior to the 12.9.  I had been wavering on this for weeks but pulled the trigger on the 9.7.  Simply put, I made the right decision and all my apps, except for IVONA (almost a show stopper), are available and working better on this than on my android platform.  I love the size (does not feel too small) and being able to handle and travel with it is so nice. If it came with a cover, I would have given it 5 stars."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01CGXU0GM", "review": "After updating the latest and greatest iOS software, I was unable to recall the original password (needed to get into iTunes and there's the option of clicking \"not now\") I used to set up a new iPad 3 bought in August 2013. An \"Activation Lock\" appeared on the screen. I could not bypass this screen even after resetting password. Apple Support suggested connecting iPad to MacBook and then restoring it. Upon completing this, still no luck. The convenience of using a tablet over the laptop makes it a necessity and it saves time. Reading reviews on the latest iPad Pro, there are some comments that this newest model does not have the battery life of former models. I was concerned about this, but I have not notice any appreciable difference. Though it does seem to drain more when not in use. It is thinner and lighter, substantially, which is not important to me. I would prefer to be using my iPad 3. It also had Retina Display and the speed and performance was equivalent. The iPad Pro has a six-digit passcode instead of four-digits and stronger security with fingerprint recognition. Using a biomarker eliminates the need to remember a password or passcode and then being subjected to an Activation Lock. It also comes with a Lighting to USB Cable to transfer data from other sources."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01CGXU0GM", "review": "The best iPad yet I upgraded from an iPad Air 2.\n\nThe screen on the iPad Pro is instantly recognizable once you've seen it side be side with an Air. It's automatic adjustments for color accuracy in various lighting conditions ('True Tone')makes for a much more comfortable viewing experience, and Apple's new 'night shift' only enhances that.\n\nHaving four speakers does significantly increase the volume range and makes it more possible for others to hear dialogue on the screen since the speakers are pointed outward in all directions. It also prevents accidentally covering a speaker from distorting an app's or song's audio too much.\n\nThe iPad Pro is also blazing fast. Every company makes a big deal out of so-called 'incremental' updates to their devices, but the A9X chip on the iPad Pro virtually eliminates app crashes (to the extent that Apple can prevent those from happening), has absolutely no lag. I've also experienced what may be a product of my perception but is nonetheless amazing: I get faster wireless internet speeds (I have gigabit fiber) on my iPad Pro than on my MacBook (12\", 2016) or my 6s Plus often over half of a Gbps, versus the still very fast wi-if speeds that my MacBook and iPhone get, usually hanging around 30-50 Mbps (see speed test pictures).\n\nAs with every iPad I've had since the original iPad was released, Apple's seamless integration of hardware and software shines in their latest iteration of the most second most iconic piece of technology from the first decade of the 2000s (the first being the iPhone, of course). The keyboard on the pro is faster and more adaptive than ever; I'm writing this whole review on my Pro in portrait mode actually. Integrated iOS apps (the ones I use, at least, especially Safari) work flawlessly alongside Facebook, Twitter, Messages, and Mail. Touch ID is faster than it's ever been, with no lag, and enhances auto fill by unlocking stored passwords and credit cards in iCloud Keychain.\n\nThe only caveat I've had so far with my 9.7\" iPad Pro is its inability to fit iPad Air 2 cases despite an identical design (new cam/mic layout and four speakers vs. two), and there are hardly any cases available for the iPad Pro, especially in its smaller size.\n\nApple's 'cases' for the iPad Pro are ridiculous. Like, totally ridiculous. Two of the photos below show how Apple's $50 silicone 'smart cover' is about 1/2 of a centimeter wider than the iPad itself, which makes carrying the device and holding it with the cover folded around the back of the device extremely uncomfortable. The quality is poor and the price is insane. Even worse, protecting the back is another $70 for a clunky silicone case that covers the back, making for an awkward two-piece cover that might have only cost pennies to make but is being sold for a total of $120.\n\nI personally love the icarer leather cases. They're slim and fit well, and are of a much higher quality than Apple's cases despite the company's sometimes comically bad interpretations (icarer is based in Hong Kong and orders are fulfilled by Amazon).\n\nI can't recommend the iPad Pro highly enough overall. Ultimately, the device is most fun to use without a case, and for $99, AppleCare+ will provide two replacements, even if the device is completely smashed, for $49 each. After that, though, you're out of luck."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B01CGXU0GM", "review": "I am, what most people consider, an Apple fan-boy. I have a MacBook Pro. An iMac. An iPhone. Two iPads. I haven't touched a Windows computer or Android phone in 5-10 years.\n\nA week ago, I decided to get rid of my MacBook Pro and replace it with the new version coming out soon (I hope). So, I decided to try an experiment  my iPad Pro will be my 100% of the time computer. Just like Tim Cook claimed it is.\n\nI write a lot. I am a prolific blogger with an extremely popular website. I write 1500 word posts with dozens of links and a few photos. I use a web-based application, so I'm not constrained by anything.\n\nLet's see what I've observed. Good points:\n\n1. Beautiful, especially in gold.\n2. With a keyboard (I'm using the Logitech Create case/keyboard for this iPad), I can add content quickly and efficiently. It works like a laptop in that sense. In fact, I'm doing this review while typing at near my normal speed.\n3. Screen is so refined, that I actually reduced font size to fit more content on the screen, and it's easily readable.\n4. Sound, through four speakers, is amazing.\n5. The Apple Pencil (dumb name there Apple, just saying) is much better than using your finger, mostly. There are some things that seem to be a tad buggy for my taste.\n6. There is some multi-tasking abilities that allow me to move between apps quite quickly.\n7. For all intents and purposes, if you started your computer life with just this iPad Pro, you'd probably be impressed. This \"computer\" is boatloads more powerful than my first laptop, a PowerBook, from the early 1990s. It's probably more powerful and speedy than anything I used up to 2010.\n\nBut there are really bad things about it that make it frustrating as a creating content device:\n\n1. Cut and paste is horrible. Selecting a word is easy, but anything more than that takes time and skill, even with the Pencil.\n2. Copying embedded links and pasting it elsewhere is worthless, in that it doesn't work at all. This is a basic requirement  if I find a sentence that has an embedded hyperlink, when I copy it to another document, the link should work. It doesn't do it. As a writer, this is very frustrating.\n3. Since iOS lacks a file structure, it's difficult to save documents to a set location. However, iOS now has iCloud Drive, so it kind of works, though it feels unrefined.\n4. The pencil sometimes doesn't do things like one's finger.\n5. Image handling isn't the greatest thing in the world, but there are workarounds.\n\nI'm going to experiment with using an iPad Pro for another week or so. I cannot agree with Apple's assessment that this is a computer. There are things that we take for granted on a computer, like trackpads and easy copy/paste, that are necessary to make this work better. If I move my hand from the keyboard, I really don't want to use the pencil, I want a refined trackpad, like Apple's own trackpads.\n\nBUT, it's closer to being a laptop than the original iPad, by a long shot. We're not that far away, but Apple can be stubborn about making the changes that would make it a superior experience.\n\nNow, if you want the iPad Pro for just a consumption device (music, videos, photos), this thing is a Five Star home run device. But if you want it for creating content, it falls short. One caveatif you're an illustrator or artist, then Pencil and iPad Pro is amazing. I just used it to do some doodles on Notes, and I was having a great time. And the Pencil works really well with the Amazon Kindle app, so highlighting and saving notes is incredible. I daresay the Kindle experience on the iPad Pro is superior to the Kindle device itself (though, it's close).\n\nSo, buy this device with your eyes wide open. If you want it to be a laptop, it can work, and it does it fairly well, despite some annoying quirks. Maybe over time, you (and I) can get used to it.\n\nIf you're an artist, you'll be impressed. It's just simply amazing.\n\nIf you're a consumer of content, the speakers and screen will be special.\n\nRight now this is a four star device, for me. If ios 10 fixes some issues, I might move it to 5 star."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B01CGXU0GM", "review": "I bought this about a week ago in South Korea. I had owned an iPad before, but I sold it and have been using Android tablets. I have a Note 12.2 and a Nexus 7 2013. It seems Android tablets are lost their momentum. Companies do not make best Android tablets any more these days. Samsung released Tab S2 last year, but its CPU is not much faster than that of Note 12.2. And 12.2 is rather slow. So, I decided to buy an iPad Pro mainly for its top-notch performance.\n\nThe speed is fast as I expected. No more lagging and stutters while browsing the web. The speakers are good as a tablet: far better than that of Note 12.2, but of course not as good as decent PC speakers. The hardware is good, but the problems of iOS are bugging me.\n\nSo, here are the problems of iOS I have found.\n\n1. Touch ID is not as good as I expected.\nIt seems as if Touch ID is an auxiliary substitution for your 6-digit PIN. You have to type in your PIN if you have restarted the iPad, even if you have enabled the Touch ID. Touch ID quite often fails to recognise my fingerprint if I tap slightly differently (the sensor is smaller than my thumb). If it fails 3 times, then you must enter your PIN. Also, if you enable Touch ID for unlocking, for some unknown reason, locking delay option gets disabled. That is, you have to provide your fingerprint, even if the iPad was just locked 3 seconds ago by screen time-out. This is really annoying. If you don't enable Touch ID, then you can set the locking delay to something like 30 minutes. Why Apple?\nAlso, if you enable Touch ID for App Store, you must provide your fingerprint for any and every download, even if they are free apps. For example if you download three free apps consecutively within 30 seconds, you must provide your fingerprint three times! What is the point? Why do I need to provide my fingerprint to download a free app?\n\n2. Siri is useless when compared to Google Now.\nThe voice recognition does not work as well as Google Now. And unlike Google Now, there is no manual input box. I use Google Now all the time to search the web. With Siri, you have to speak, and Siri does not understand long sentences.\n\n3. Notification bar is useless.\nThe drop-down notification bar is useless compared to that of Android. On Android, it shows on-going activities, useful actions, etc. On iOS there are just useless fixed \"widgets\". None of the widgets from 3rd party apps were useful. No widgets display on-going activities such as download progress. For example, on Note 12.2, I can turn off the VPN connection right from the notification bar. On iPad, I had to open the VPN app and turn it off (there is a button to turn off VPN in the settings app, but it did not work).\nAlso there is no shortcut to system settings in the notification bar or in the quick settings bar (slide up). I had to exit the app I was using and then find the system settings icon from the home screen and tap it to go to the settings.\n\n4. Using multiple Apple ID's is very difficult.\nOn Android, all Google apps provide a unified, easy way to switch between multiple Google ID's. On iPad, you must sign out, and then type the ID and password of your other Apple ID. If your Apple ID is protected by two-step verification, you must do that each time, because there is no option for \"don't ask again for this device\".\n\n5. No \"web search\" context menu for text selection.\nThis is really frustrating, because I search the web very often. Isn't it really easy to implement? On Android, if you select a word in any app, there is \"web search\" context menu. iOS has no such thing. I have to copy it and then open the web browser and paste it.\n\n6. Dictionary pop-up is not customisable.\nIt seems the dictionaries are automatically set by your language settings. For example, I have set the system language to English UK, Oxford American English Dictionary is automatically added and cannot be removed. So, I have to scroll it each time to see the UK dictionary. And the dictionary font is really small and sometimes its background is black and the contrast is too low to be legible. Is it really that difficult to let us change the font or the colour?"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01CGXU0GM", "review": "I resisted using iPhones for the longest time because my Sony Ericssons had a better quality camera. When Sony moved over to Android, I took the plunge and bought an iPhone. Once I became proficient with iOS, I did not want to use another system. That's the primary reason I went with my first iPad Air. I use my iPad primarily as a toy. I don't need it for work and I prefer my desktop computer for any serious work. It's a worthy replacement for a laptop and much more convenient with better battery life. And then it happened...\n\nI was using my iPad to look up the wiring sequence on a dryer. I should have paid closer attention to the placement of my screwdriver. I was using a hefty Wiha screwdriver with the \"full tang\" butt. It landed squarely on top of my screen and promptly shattered it. I was distraught. It's not like I can't be without my iPad, but it felt like a pet in need. I had broken my companion. I was an unsuitable master! Although my iPad Air still worked, tiny shards of Gorilla Glass in my fingers were a constant reminder of my betrayal. I couldn't go on like this!\n\nLike any man in a desperate situation, I was not thinking clearly. Yes, I could have replaced my original iPad Air with a certified refurbished version for less than half the cost of this. I could have even upgraded to the Air II. That's when I saw the Pro. It wasn't that much more money. Would this redeem me in the eyes of the iPad gods? Before good sense could prevail I ordered my Pro 9.7\" from Amazon (which promptly left the package unattended at my front door the next day with no signature required).\n\nSo here I am a month later with my new toy. The screen is truly fabulous, the best I have seen on any tablet. It has bells and whistles I may never even discover. The sound is truly fantastic for a tablet. It does get fairly warm if you do any serious work on it, so I'm not sure how much AutoCAD work you will really accomplish. It does what I need and looks better than any other iPad while doing it. Did I really need the Pro? No, I suppose not. For my purposes I was fine with my original iPad Air. I do enjoy the multi-tasking feature and feel this was a worthwhile improvement. I did a fair amount of streaming on my old iPad which definitely looks and sounds better now on the Pro.\n\nWhen it all boils down, many users probably cannot justify the cost of the Pro over a lesser iPad, but does it matter? We don't buy what we need, we buy what we want. The Pro ticks just enough of the right boxes to justify its purchase (and it really isn't THAT much more than the standard iPad Air II.\n\nAs for my original iPad Air, it was rescued with the addition of&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/iPad-Pro-9-7-inch-Screen-Protector/dp/B00S3RU62O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">iPad Pro 9.7 inch Screen Protector</a>&nbsp;It now lives in my garage for those times when I need to look up a part or need a write-up on changing an axle."}

It runs apps wonderfully, and is the best reader you can find. Absolutely wonderful. Plus Apple support is truly excellent. All of this combined is why I gave it 5 stars.\n\nSo why did I return it? Did you know that you cannot use a mouse with an iPad? I'm not kidding. Imagine with me for a moment what it is like to try to move your cursor around in a Word document or an email. You put your finger on the touchscreen and press. Now understand that your finger itself covers up the exact spot you are trying to move your cursor to. Oops, I made the cursor move 2 spaces to the right of what I need. So I precariously move my finger over what I believe to be 2 spaces to the left and put it down on the screen. OK, getting better, it's still 1 space to the right but making progress. A third attempt and I now went too far to the left, but hey I'm bracketing the thing now. On my fourth try I nail it.\n\nNow imagine doing that over and over, numerous times a day as you edit a Word document or an email. It's absolutely ridiculous. Why do they not allow a mouse? Especially on the very small 9.7 inch screen?\n\nYes this is a great reader, surfing the web is wonderful, and the apps are great. Fast, lightweight with a long battery, what's not to love? The lack of a mouse!\n\nSo I returned mine. Still searching for something like it, that allows use of a mouse."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01CGXU0GM", "review": "I would like first to point out that I did not purchase the iPad Pro 9.7 from Amazon, I purchased it through AT&T, my cell carrier. I would also like to say that I am not a big fan Apple products, the iPad Pro is a rare occasion where I purchased an Apple product.\n\nBesides the iPad Pro, I also have in my house: AT&T Trek HD, Samsung Galaxy Tab S2, Samsung Galaxy Tabe E, LG G Pad X. Obviously all these are not mine, but for various members of my family. But I have used them all. To be honest, they all work fine in their own right. The reason why I decided to buy the iPad Pro is because for the first time in many years, the iPad stood apart from all other tablets in performance.\n\nWith the A9X Processor and 2gb of RAM, the iPad Pro is fast. I have not experienced any lag in any of the tasks I've preformed and that includes watching movies and playing games like a \"Heroes of the Galaxy\".\n\nThe 2048 x 1536 resolution (264 ppi pixel density) on the iPad Pro 9.7 offers a crystal clear image and the best of I've seen on any tablet.\n\nThe 12 MP rear camera stands alone in the tablet market, there isn't another tablet that even comes close to the picture quality. Why might a person use this camera? I use the iPad Pro for work, my work requires me to take pictures on job sites and then type out a report. My iPad Pro serves this dual purpose. If you enjoy taking pictures, does it really matter what you take the pictures with? Nice pictures are what matter and the iPad Pro takes great pictures.\n\nThe fingerprint sensor works flawlessly.\n\nI will say the \"True Tone\" display could use some improvement. Under certain nighttime conditions, it can give the display a slight yellow tinge. This is really the only real problem I have with the iPad Pro 9.7 and it is a very small problem.\n\nThe iPad Pro 9.7 is in my opinion the best tablet on the market when you consider size and power. It is expensive, so for some people other Apple tablets may be a better value. But if you have the money and you're looking for a high performance tablet, you won't regret owning the iPad Pro 9.7."}

This may be fine some places but on a recent trip the Caribbean our photos were all tagged as being hundreds of miles away in Florida.  In addition, we tried using the Navionics app on the iPad to act as a backup chartplotter for our boat but, since it doesn't have a few dollar GPS receiver, it wasn't up to the task.  We tried my friend's iPhone but the Navionics app is iPad-only so we were unable to use it.  We even tried finding an app that would let us tether his GPS to the iPad (something that's easily doable with Androids or Windows devices) so Navionics would work but, as usual, there is no way to do this with Apple devices :/  It's possible the cellular-enabled iPads have GPS, though Apple's product page doesn't say it so I doubt it.  Such a shame that Apple wouldn't include this on ALL iPads...\n\nOn top of everything, I ran across bugs and UI glitches while using the iPad, and the app selection has totally changed since I last owned an iPhone back in 2006!  It used to be that Apple had more apps and they were better quality than Android.  Now the opposite is true - Androids have so many more apps and can do SO much more there's no comparison.  As for app quality, they're about the same - some apps crash on Androids and some crashed on my iPad, but that's on the app developers not Apple or Google.\n\nNeedless to say, my iPad trial was a huge disappointment so back to Amazon it goes, I'll stick with my Androids and Windows devices which cost a lot less and can do SO MUCH more.  I was not expecting this, I was expecting to be blown away after not owning an Apple product for 10 years, I figured they would be light years ahead of the competition.  Heck, I even bought accessories for the iPad that can't be returned because I expected to keep it!  But I'd rather waste a few bucks on a case and charging cable than $700 on a paperweight :D"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B01CGXU0GM", "review": "(This review is for the Black 128GB Wifi only iPad Pro 9.7 purchased from Apple directly)\n\nI've used Apple products for about 11 years now since I got an iPod.  I've had mostly positive experiences with Apple products with a few minor exceptions and although I have owned many different Apple devices I would not consider myself a \"fanboy.\"\n\nThis is my 5th iPad and I have to say, I'm very happy having used it over the past month.  I use my tablet mainly for browsing the internet, checking and writing emails, shopping on Amazon, watching Youtube, watching movies, and misc other things.  I could have very well went with a Surface or an Android Tablet of similar specs for less money but I've been satisfied with my iPads and have always been pleased with the functionality and the battery life.\n\nUnless you're looking for a larger screen, this is without a doubt the best iPad and in general a solid tablet.  One of the main reasons I bought this was because I also like sketching on my tablets and up until now, the experience has always been just so-so at best for Apple. I actually considered the iPad Pro but the large screen was just too much for me and I wanted something more portable.  When I saw this iPad Pro release I knew it would be something to consider.  I have been using the iPad Mini for the past few generations and I really liked the size but I didn't mind stepping up in size if that meant a big increase in capabilities.\n\nThis iPad is the fastest it has ever been, the screen looks fantastic, the stereo speakers are great, the Apple Pencil is one of the best styli I've ever used, and I really like the new smart connector for the keyboards.  The new processor handles everything very well and multitasking on it with this iPad works better than ever.  The multitasking was one of my newer favorite features on the iPad but it really hasn't been implemented as well as I would have liked and could be a little slow or janky on my other iPad Mini 4.  With this iPad it is quick and simple and although the software for multitasking could be improved a bit, the feature works very well.\n\nThe speakers have turned out to be another new favorite feature.  They sound good, the stereo sound improves watching movies exponentially, and they can get loud without much distortion.  Watching movies and videos is a far better experience with the good looking screen and  the speakers.\n\nThere are a lot of great features with this iPad that I could go into but won't for the sake of keeping this slightly shorter, however another thing to point out is how much better the camera is.  I believe it matches the iPhone 6s Plus camera which is probably one of the better cameras on a tablet so far.  I don't use the camera much honestly but it is a nice addition.  Also, I have not bought or used the smart keyboard but will eventually make use of the smart connector.\n\nNow it is hard to go into the capabilities with the Apple Pencil because it is not included with the iPad and is also part of the reason this iPad gets 4 stars instead of 5 for my review.  The Apple Pencil is just awesome.  I may not have had a lot of experiences with different high end styli but using the Apple Pencil is unlike any experience I have ever had with a stylus and a touch screen.  It feels good going against the glass and the pressure sensitivity and using the Pencil at angles feels perfect and intuitive.  It really comes close to the feeling of using a pen or pencil on paper and if I was still in college I would very likely use it to take notes in class.\n\nWhile the functionality of the Apple Pencil along with the capabilities of this iPad to use it are amazing, the Pencil doesn't come with the iPad and there is not place to store it easily on the device.  While the storage issue isn't a big deal, one of this iPads main features over the iPad Airs that came before is using the Pencil.  If you didn't plan on using the Apple Pencil then I might just suggest you spend far less money and get the last iPad Air instead.  Not only is the Pencil not included but it cost $100 which isn't all that affordable although what Apple product really is.\nAnother issue I have is that this is the newest Apple device and one of the best new features with the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus is the 3D Touch which this iPad does not have.  While the 3D touch may seem a bit of a gimmick, it is another great input option for touch screens that would have made for a great addition on this new iPad.  I personally think it should have made it into the feature set and along with not including a Pencil, this is why the iPad Pro 9.7 gets 4 stars from me.\n\nConsidering the price and especially the price including the Apple Pencil, it can be hard to recommend this new iPad Pro 9.7.  With the 128GB version that I got along with the Apple Pencil, the total comes to around $850 without even buying a case or a keyboard.  When you're spending that much money you could definitely look into some of the Surface tablets that include the stylus and a keyboard or if you're not even interested in a stylus and keyboard, you could spend a lot less getting a Samsung tablet.  However, if you're like me and enjoy your Apple products, are maybe a little invested in iTunes, and aren't as bothered by paying a premium then I can easily recommend this iPad.  It is fast, the battery lasts for around 10 hours, the Apple Pencil is great, and it just works well.  If you're in the market for a new iPad, you really can't go wrong getting this one.\n\nI'll update my review should I find any glaring issues and I can answer any questions."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01CGXU0GM", "review": "I've owned almost all the iPad models in the past, and this is the snappiest and fastest device yet. Launching apps and camera, unlocking the device using the fingerprint, volume controls,  orientation changing, Bluetooth, ambient light sensor, and etc, just every function and feature on this device works the way I expected and executes every command without any issue. I've been using this device for several months now, and I haven't found one single issue.\nThe screen is the most beautiful part. I've noticed the gab between the surface glass, and the LCD panel underneath is almost non existent. When I read a book on the iPad, it feels as if the texts are right on the surface (just like the texts are printed on a paper). I enjoy more and more reading on this device these days than on a Kindle.\nAmbient light sensor also works fantastically. It senses the amount of light around the space I'm in very accurately and controls the brightness automatically and accordingly so my eyes don't get strained easily. True Tone is another nice feature on this model. At first I wasn't comfortable with the automatic color temperature shift on the screen, but soon, I felt ease on my eyes with this feature on compared to my iPhone screen without the True Tone feature.\nI bought the LTE version because only this model in tablet is compatible with t-mobile's Extended Range LTE (band 12). With my T-mobile data plan on this iPad, I get better connectivity than on my phone, and it's been reliable on the road when I travel. Especially with all the perks (BingeOn, Music Freedom) from T-mobile plan, this iPad couldn't be more useful on the road or outside.\n\nOverall, this is my go-to device that is light, portable, fast, and beautiful. Of course it doesn't replace my work laptop that runs photo/video editing applications, but for almost everything else, this device does it in such an efficient way. Battery lasts long enough (pretty much all day), and the new 4 speakers are nice (finally, stereo sound!) I debated between this 9.7\" and 12.9\" before I made the purchase, and I don't regret choosing this one. Bigger screen size can benefit the user when consuming medias, but it is little too big to carry around.\nOne thing I am not happy with is the 'swapped magnet polarity' for Smart Cover. My old iPad Air covers are not compatible with this new pro version anymore. Other than that, I am quite satisfied with this newest version, and I hope it stays that way for the next 4-5 years."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B01CGXU0GM", "review": "This new iPad Pro 9.7\" model is very similar to my already excellent iPad Air 2, but the two speakers on that model do not sound good at high volume. Rather irritating to the ears. This new \"Pro\" model has four speakers (not two), and the sound is quite a bit better, on par with my old iPad 3rd Generation, which is mono. Volume wise, the old 3rd Generation is still a bit louder and clearer than the new \"Pro,\" but because it has one speaker, it is not quite as easy to hear in another room. It may be the laws of sound acoustics in physics.\n\nPerformance is a little better on the \"Pro,\" but not by a long shot. It is as good for browsing the Internet, and opening many documents as on the iPad Air 2. However, it charges the battery slowly on USB 2.0. Every single iPad that Apple has made, regardless of its connector, will charge faster on a USB 3.0 computer. Yes, even charging in the wall is slow as if it were USB 2.0. The connector that goes into the wall is a USB 2.0, which very few people actually know. I have done some experimentation to prove this. If you have a MacBook Pro, Mac Pro (2013 model), or PC with USB 3.0, you will have a faster charging cycle. Still, the iPad 3rd Generation has the best battery life, because it is thicker with a larger mA (milliAmp count) rating.\n\nCamera. OK, it is better than the iPad Air 2 (the 3rd Generation iPad--poor-fair in good light). Comparing the photos to my iPhone 6s Plus, they aren't on par. Nice to have the LED flash--a first for an iPad, and works fine for a flashlight. Caused blurry photos, iPhone doesn't do that most often. Rolling shutter is very noticeable, just slightly more evident than on the iPhone 6s Plus. Hunts a good bit in low-light because it doesn't have image stabilization and continuous autofocus found in the iPhone 6s Plus. Even taking a photo during video does not exist. I realize that the iPhone is better suited for camera work, and probably always will be. However, even though it can record 4K video and 12 MP stills, it does not quite match the iPhone 6s Plus. Many reviewers have stated it takes great photos and videos, and has the camera from the iPhone 6s Plus, but I don't see that. What is good about using the camera on an iPad is that you can really see what you are capturing because of the big display. Even the new Microsoft Surface Pro's front camera is on par with the iPhone 6 (not the 6s models). I tested it out at a local retailer, pretty amazing.\n\nI would not recommend any \"Pro\" iPad over the Air 2 model if you already have one, unless you can't stand the grating sound through the flat speakers, and want to take photos with a flash. It is more practical to use the iPad as a very portable computer, nothing else for serious use. Aim for the largest capacity because it makes you look cool, and that you are the least likely to run out of space.\n\nFour stars for being just a minor upgrade over the Air 2, but as always, I really like Apple products, and they are of great quality. I find it hard to draw on a tablet, maybe because the Adobe software is very crippled (it is--terrible, I have found its tools are minimal), but if you can somehow find an accessory for the keyboard to use a wireless Apple Mighty Mouse through Bluetooth, it would be nice for those who are so accustomed to doing graphic design on a very small laptop. The pencil is not included, as with the keyboard, it is extra. Perhaps doing sketching works best, but doing Illustrator work with a pencil is pretty much impossible, as your hands are very shaky, with a mouse or Wacom tablet the control is much better.\n\nStill a good device and price is reasonable for what you get. The 12.7\" Pro model is larger and has double the RAM (4 GB), but like all the other models, the camera is no different from the iPad Air 2--kind of decent at best, and of course, no flash. Thanks for reading."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01CGXU0GM", "review": "I bought my iPad for my trip to Asia, and it has even trumped my Canon T6i SLR.  I literally only pull out my Canon camera only when I want to use the telephoto lens.  The camera and the video on the iPad are awesome!  And  to look at the pictures and videos on such a beautiful screen is a total pleasure,  especially for one who already needs  to use progressive glasses.  I also really love the sound quality when I play movies on it.  Finally Apple came up with a device that has great sound.  I can't say enough good things about it.  I am so glad that I did not buy iPad Air or an iPad mini of any generation.\n\nNow here comes the sad part of my story. On my Asian trip the iPad cover magnet came off, and the iPad  went crashing to the ground in Kyoto.  Everything is totally functional, the glass screen is cracked and the  aluminum  has a little dent.  I checked the Apple website, and it says that replacing the screen would cost me $375.  I haven't gone to the Apple Store yet as I am now in Taiwan.  What is the chance that Apple will replace my iPad for free or for less then $375  since it was the magnet on the Apple brand cover that came off?\n\n I hope I will have a happy ending to the story.  In the meantime I want to advise everybody to not buy just a screen cover for this beautiful iPad.  Please do yourself a favor and buy a proper case.  The powder aluminum surface of the iPad is extremely slippery.  Even though I have had iPhone 4 and iPhone 5 for the last five years and have never cracked any screen, I managed to ruin this iPad in just one week of use."}

The issue is Amazon.\n\nAfter my iPad was hit by a car, I figured it was time to get another one. So, placing the order on June 16, the site estimated that the product would be to me by June 23 or 24. Come June 19 I was curious, as the device had not yet shipped. The telephone support agent was helpful and said that the device should arrive as scheduled no later than June 23. Pleased, I went about my business. June 23 came, and still the package had not shipped. I called again. This support agent was friendly and helpful and upgraded the item to priority next day shipping. So, I was again quite pleased. Come June 28 I got a confirmation that the item would arrive the next day (June 29). Fine with that, I again went about my business. The next day I got an email stating that the order would be delayed yet another day, now arriving on the 30th of June and still the item has not shipped. Peeved, I called the support line a third time and spoke with two clearly unseasoned support agents (one who said he was a 'supervisor in-charge'). They were snippy and impatient speaking through their teeth the entire time as I asked for some form of compensation for the significant delays. (I've never asked for something like this, ever!)\n\nAs a Prime member I had read the contract and knew that a one-month extension to my membership would be afforded as a given, but seeing as two weeks had elapsed, I felt justified in asking for a bit more. The first agent offered a mere 10 dollars in store credit on a 750+ dollar item, the second offered up to 30 dollars and a month of additional time on my membership and ended the call in a huff (without my consultation) one might consider that being 'hung up on'. Unsatisfied, I am still not in receipt of the iPad and am writing this review since the Amazon telephone support agents don't seem to like speaking with me (Now, I was respectful and kept a measured tone the entire time despite the less than friendly reception I got on the other side of that call)... Anyway, I'll provide an update if/when this device arrives."}

I don't leave home without it.  at least not for long!  It was however, getting slow and dropping apps in the middle. So, I started reading up.  Couldn't believe how many ipads have come and gone.  Anyway,  I bought the rose 9.7 ipad pro.  In shopping around, this one had the fastest processor and I like fast.  I loved it's drawing capabilities.  I received it in great shape.  It was easy to get it registered and up and running.  There was a smooth transition between my old and my new in transferring apps and my documents.  It has faltered on one app a little but it might be operator error.  I am thrilled with the speed.  It is everything they promised it would be.  The fingerprint id works super and it was so easy to set up.  I'm not a techy so I can't go into those specs but I can say I am thrilled with it.  The apps that were dying on my old ipad (which I have kept) start up amazingly fast.  The sound is wonderful.  Not \"tinny\" like it's ancestors!

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01CGXU0GM", "review": "QUICK SIDE NOTE TO THOSE WHO ALREADY OWN THE 12.9 VERSION: Apple let me return the 12.9 (6 months after I bought it!) for the 9.7. If you already own the larger one and wish you had the smaller one, go to your local Apple store and ask to return it. They were super helpful/understanding with me.\n\nI owned the 12.9 version and absolutely loved it. I own a Macbook Pro, Mac mini, Apple TV, Apple Watch, iPad Air, plus an iPhone, and the iPad Pro was BY FAR my favorite device out of all of them. In the end, I found the 9.7 version to be slightly more portable and therefore better suited to my needs. However, let me be clear: I highly recommend either product. The 12.9 and 9.7 are both fantastic. It really comes down to personal preference on screen size.\n\nI wanted to write a review for people who were debating the cost of this tablet vs. less expensive alternatives. The saying, \"you get what you pay for\" is entirely accurate for the tablet market. The entry level price for the iPad Pro 9.7 is $698 ($599 for the iPad Pro, $99 for the Apple Pencil, which is absolute MUST HAVE for this device.) This device WILL NOT outright replace a laptop (for most people). So yes, this is an expensive tablet. Now I am not someone who thinks Apple is the only company capable of having good ideas or great products. If you're on a budget, there are less expensive options out there (Id' recommend the Nexus 7 or Asus Zenpad S8, I own both) But at $698, the iPad Pro 9.7 OUT PREFORMS it's cost. Sure, you can pay $300 for a Samsung tablet, but it will underwhelm you in comparison, as will the iPad Air 2.\n\nThe iPad Pro is hands down the fastest tablet available (This isn't debatable, numbers don't lie). It feels as fast if not faster than any computer or laptop I've ever used. But the speed is not what you'll fall in love with.\n\nIn my opinion, the Apple Pencil is what sets this tablet apart from any other tablet. YOU DO NOT NEED TO BE AN ARTIST TO HAVE A USE FOR THE APPLE PENCIL! I own my own business. I constantly have to annotate PDF files, sign documents, jot notes down. Being able to preform these tasks digitally is not only MUCH more convenient, it's fun! You can mark up things and email them back instantly. For me this is invaluable. You can take a picture (with THE BEST camera on a tablet, again, not debatable) throw it in Notes and use the Apple Pencil to handwrite a few notes about it, and send it away. For this specific task, it is better to have an iPad Pro than a laptop.\n\nIn addition, the speakers are amazing. Seriously, 11 out of 10 for a mobile device. I cannot understate this. They sound great and they are loud enough to entertain a small party. My bluetooth speaker has been sitting on the shelf since I bought the iPad Pro. Recently took a vacation to Florida and brought the iPad Pro to the pool. To own an ultra portable device that you can store all of your music on and play it on its internal speakers without having to pair it to some other battery driven device is awesome to me! Around the house, I listen to podcasts on it all of the time. I can leave the room and still hear it in the kitchen. I absolutely love the speakers and simply will not purchase another tablet unless they can match these speakers. I cannot go without them now.\n\nThe iPad Pro has a number of other amazing features that I'm sure the other reviews will highlight. I will end my review with this: This is undoubtedly the best tablet available. As with almost anything, if you want the best, it's going to cost you more. My advice to anyone willing to spend around $350 for a tablet OR laptop, spend the extra money to purchase an iPad Pro instead. It will run circles around any tablet or laptop in that price range, and from my experience, it will become the favorite electronic device that you've ever bought."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01CGXU0GM", "review": "My last review of a new iPad began with a confession which I repeat-I am an iPad addict. My illness has not abated. I am no closer to a cure than I was in October, 2014 when I got my hands on an iPad Air 2. At best I control my obsession.\n\nI have owned every generation of the iPad (all WiFi plus cellular) since it was introduced in 2010. It has become an indispensable tool in my litigation practice. Other lawyers, lugging large boxes of files for short hearings are often amazed as my iPad swiftly retrieves documents  I purposely avoided the 12 in iPad Pro as I found it too large for my purposes. Apple 9.7 inch iPad Pro was worth the wait.\n\nAlthough cellular capacity, may not be a necessity for all, I frequently find myself in courtrooms and law offices which do not have accessible WiFi. Cellar lets me surf, upload files and documents from my file server and use Facebook when I am waiting for something to begin.\n\nThere are some significant improvements over my iPad Air 2. The first is speed  The A9X chip is extremely fast. Although the previous A8X chip in the Air 2 was faster than its predecessor, the difference is noticeable.\n\nCameras are greatly upgraded. The front camera as a resolution of 12 MP whIle the back camera, mostly used for selfies and Skyping and FaceTime, weighs in with 5 MP. HOwever it is the video that will most impress. Video can be shot in 4K which will lead to cinema quality movies of home birthday parties being shown to grandparents everywhere.\n\nThe upgraded camera undoubtedly is why Apple has discontinued the 64 GB model. The iPad Pro is only available in 32, 128, 256 GB models. The smallest may well have storage problems but it too is a doubling of the former 16 GB unit. If you are going to opt for the 32 GB iPad, have a backup storage plan in place. Otherwise your iPad will fill quickly. On the other hand, 256 GB seems like overkill.\n\nOne of the most interesting improvements is in the display. Reading books on iPad using the Kindle app has largely been an indoor-only enterprise. The ability to read in bright light has bee'n best handled on a Kindle e-book reader. That singular advantage has disappeared. iPad adjusts for lighting conditions making reading comfortable inside or out.\n\nOne of the heavily promoted accessories is the Apple Pencil. It is technogically advanced. I tried it. It is perfect for drawing. That is not one of my strengths. I did watch one prospect creating a spectular sketch and then carefully coloring it.\n\nFor those who wish to replace a laptop with an iPad Pro, this model like its bigger bother had snap on keyboard. Although I use my iPad extensively in my law practice, I am not yet ready to ditch my MacBook Pro. Perhaps that day will come for me, but it's not here yet.\n\nOne accessory I did buy was a smart cover. In spite of its close resemblance to the iPad Air 2, the smart covers are not interchangeable. This suggests that those who prefer cases will find similar incompatibility.\n\nFinally!, one of the biggest mistakes iPad neophytes make is failing to buy AppleCare Plus."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01CGXU0GM", "review": "This is a tricky device to rate and review, mainly due to Apple's categorizing it as a Pro device.  As such, it's a bit underwhelming in a few ways.  As an \"iPad Air 3\", however, it's outstanding right out of the box.\n\nTrue Tone Display, A9X chip,  Pencil support, improved cameras (front and back), four auto-adjusting stereo speakers - all of those are remarkable... and likely upgrades many would have expected from Apple had they simply announced an iPad Air 3.  Instead, they repackage their 9.7\" offering as a smaller version of the iPad Pro, and touted it during the Keynote (and on their site) as \"...the ultimate upgrade for ANY iPad owner\"... and priced it as such.  It's here that I have a bit of a problem.\n\nI may be a bit unique here, in that I upgraded from the still-fast iPad Air 2 and not a much older model.  I also have a 12.9\" iPad Pro, and I can accurately state that the speed/performance boost does not warrant the \"Pro\" moniker for the smaller iPad.  In day-to-day usage, I'm seeing maybe a second or so speed increases.  Sometimes more, sometimes less.  It's blazing fast, but so was the Air 2.  It even shares the same 2GB of RAM that the iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 4 have, half of what the larger Pro contains.  Apple's mastery of software optimization aside, this is troubling, especially when you consider that just last year the key feature of \"iPad multitasking\" was reserved for \"Apple's most powerful tablet\" - i.e. the iPad Air 2, which had the most RAM of any iOS device at the time.  With iOS 10 on the horizon, potential new features that may be hardware-intensive might only be available for the 12.9\" Pro, which would be a hard pill to swallow for owners of Apple's NEWEST \"Pro\" device.  If that turns out to not be the case, then it's irritating for another reason: the \"lowly\" iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 4 can perform those same tasks - all for HUNDREDS of dollars less.  RAM requires battery, heat dissipation, etc. - I get that.  Perhaps just two speakers (top and bottom in portrait view, which would still have been an improvement over the Air 2's one loud speaker) instead of four would have been a better move. That would allow for more battery space, and perhaps a happy medium of 3GB of RAM.\n\nThe use of the \"Pro\" moniker here (iOS limitations themselves aside) stems entirely from the optional accessories - the  Pencil and Smart Keyboard.  With the larger Pro, even without the Pencil (which you REALLY DO want/need) or the Keyboard, it still lives up to its Pro name more accurately, if only by sheer screen real estate. This makes multitasking rather natural and infinitely more pleasant.  In landscape, it's essentially two 9.7\" iPad devices in portrait mode, side by side.\n\nApple also chose to not include their newer 2nd Gen Touch ID sensor, showcased in the newest iPhones, as well as opting for a USB 2 Lightning port (12.9\" iPad Pro has the much faster USB 3 port).  It's little things like this that make you scratch your head and go \"Why, Apple?? Were you afraid we'd think it was TOO perfect?\"  Apple does this quite a bit, actually... it's infuriating.\n\nIt may sound like I don't like this 9.7\" version, which couldn't be further from the truth.  Apple has produced a powerhouse of a tablet in a familiar form factor with an absolutely beautiful screen (superior to the larger Pro's offering in several critical ways), much improved sound (not as full as the 12.9\", but worlds better than any previous iPad), and drastically improved cameras.  The latter may be laughed at or under-appreciated, but there are times when taking pictures with an iPad is extremely convenient: you're somewhere reading or doing something in an app, and a photo op presents itself.  Instead of closing or putting down your iPad and locating/fumbling with your iPhone (particularly the 6s/6s Plus and their ridiculously-fast Touch ID that renders the lockscreen camera nearly inaccessible), you now have access to the same 12MP/4k iSight camera on your iPad.  Scanning documents is another useful strength here.  A TrueTone flash... why not?  The improved 5MP front-facing FaceTime camera is a godsend; I'm not a selfie guy, but my wife and I FaceTime often, particularly when we're deployed.  Clearer video is always a good thing.  At 6.1mm thin - thinner than the iPhone - it obviously sports the much-complained-about protruding camera lens on the back.  I don't have a problem with it, personally, and it doesn't cause any wobbling if you're typing on a flat surface (lens cover is sapphire, so no need to worry about scratching).  Then again, I don't mind the bump on the iPhone either, so if you're one that hates that, it's something to consider.  Most cases will alleviate this \"problem\".\n\nAside from the camera bump and speaker grilles, the only other external difference you'll be able to spot lies on the side: the Smart Connector, which allows for direct connectivity of certain accessories.  Apple's own Smart Keyboard (9.7\") is awesome, and though a bit more cramped than the larger version, it's still an outstanding typing experience with snap-n-play simplicity and good looks.\n\nThis iPad also supports the  Pencil, which is wonderful.  For some reason, the latency seems the tiniest smidge behind that of the larger iPad Pro, but it's still far and away the best stylus/writing input I've ever used (and I've used most).\n\nPricing... look, I'm usually the first to defend Apple and their pricing.  Not only as a reflection of their quality - they do produce some of the best products - but the fact that people KNOW Apple, and they KNOW about Apple's prices.  No need to go complaining about it... pay to play, or don't.  Having said that, for what you're getting with this tablet out of the box, the $100 markup from the previous 9.7\" model (and all of the ones prior) is simply unjustified.  It is a BEAST of an iPad Air, but you don't get really any \"Pro\" unless you spend another $250 on the Pencil and Keyboard (and that's not even getting into the ridiculous price markup they did with the covers/cases). Although I feel the larger Pro offers a bit more \"Pro\" by virtue of its screen for productivity multitasking and creative professionals, it too is overpriced - almost ridiculously so, and likely in such a way to provide a justified cushion for this 9.7\" version's pricing.\n\nPROS:\nTrueTone Display, with wide color gamut and extra-low reflectivity coating\nBright Screen (considerably brighter than the 12.9\" version)\nFamiliar size\nIntelligent stereo speakers x4\nImproved iSight (12MP) and FaceTime (5MP) cameras, w/TrueTone and Retina Flash\nA9X chip offers outstanding power\n Pencil support\nAwesome, compact Smart Keyboard support\nSub-1lb weight\n256GB storage option\nTraditional \"very good\" iPad battery life (10+ hours of continuous video)\n\nCONS:\nScreen size doesn't lend itself to \"Pro\" moniker\nPrice - you're effectively paying more for the ability to use expensive accessories (sold separately)\n2GB RAM, same as iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 4 (12.9\" iPad Pro has 4GB)\nA9X chip clocked lower than the 12.9\" version, affecting processing and graphics power\nFirst-gen Touch ID\nUSB 2 lightning port (USB 3 for 12.9\" version, significantly faster charging option available)\n\nAs a \"Pro\" device, it's a bit short on features, and you need to spend quite a bit more to squeeze out the few features that are there.  PC (personal computer) replacement?  For MILLIONS of people... yes, but then, so were previous iPads.  Scoff if you must, but it's the truth.  As an all-around iPad, it's by far the best they've ever made.  The sticky part is that most, if not all, of the the additions are what you'd expect from a typical Apple upgrade, and those have historically been kept at a particular price - starting at $499.  If Apple had managed to keep the pricing the same, or offer compelling, must-have, on-device features, it would be a no-brainer.  Shame... it really is the best tablet available, and the best iPad ever.  The pricing and occasional \"...but it's already available on the older version!!\" feature omission knocks down (a bit) what would be an easy perfect score, 5-star product.\n\nOverall 4.5/5"}

Starbucks gets my day started, I listen to Sonos every time  I watch tv or play I tunes, and I use my iPad more than I care to admit.  This is by far the best iPad to date.  The 12.9 was a little too big, especially since my last two iPads were minis.  Best Buy was running a sale last week on the 128gb models, so I picked up two.  The new Trutone display is much easier on my eyes and the four speakers sound better to the ears.  The fingerprint sensor from the iPhone 6s works flawlessly.  The camera and flash (also from the 6s) are the best in a tablet as well.  Yes the camera does stick out the back slightly, but a case takes care of this.  Now a quick word of caution.  After I download my songs, apps, etc I updated to IOS 9.3.2.  This caused my iPad to brick up.  Basically frozen and unusable.  Apparently a few others had this problem as well.  Should of read first.  I left it plugged into the charger and about 45 minutes it returned to life.  I decided to wait before updating the second iPad.  It has been fine ever since and I'm typing on it now.  Got two pencils at the same time.  Pencil works great as a stylus and my wife loves drawing with it.  I currently have no intention on buying the keyboard, but it is nice to have the option."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01CGXU0GM", "review": "I had a hard time deciding between this and the ipad pro 12.9\" version. A few things swayed me into buying this 9.7\" one. It felt better when holding it in my hands, $200 cheaper, improvements made to the screen (True tone display, less reflective, brighter), and also the upgraded camera.\nThe 4 stereo speakers will certainly amaze you when gaming or watching movies. The sound made a bigger difference that I thought it would and certainly is better than any Macbook or very expensive gaming laptop I've ever owned. I also love that any problem I have, I can just walk into a physical Apple store and they are outstanding about making you happy and fixing the problem.\n\nMy only slight con is only having 2gb ram. This doesn't affect anything presently, especially with how slick the iOS runs. But maybe in another year or 2 some beasty game will come out to use more ram, hard to predict."}
