My Microsoft account transferred with ease and I am excited to begin to use my free year of Microsoft Office.  Wow, what a deal!  I would recommend this tablet to anyone, and the irulu.com website has a lot of other deals on Android tablets.\n\nOverall, the tablet is heavy and well-built.  The battery life seems very respectable.  Most importantly, the tablet is fast and very responsive.  I feel lucky to have gotten one of these little \"treasures.\"\n\nThank you Irulu and Amazon."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "I was actually pretty impressed with how snappy this tablet was! I tested it on a bunch of different tests, played netflix, hulu, amazon prime and youtube without an issue. I have also tried playing several low powered  steam games that played flawlessly like Shovel knight. Speaking of Steam I streamed games with no issues over my network from my normal desktop, it's a great little convertible tablet for the money."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "This product has well exceeded my expectations in both quality and performance.  I compared this tablet to a couple others before deciding that the IRULU had the best combination of features, performance and price.  My only concern was buying an unknown brand of technology, but then again, even the most well known brands have their share of problems.  However my impression now is that IRULU isn't in the business of making low cost, low quality alternatives, but rather looking to compete with the name brands in terms of quality and reputation.  I bought this to be able to run the full version of my trading software, Metatrader 4, on the go and on a larger screen instead of relying on their limited Android app on my smartphone.  Only a powerful enough tablet running full Windows could do this and this one works perfectly.  This is essentially a mini laptop in tablet form that's portable enough to take with you anywhere you go and powerful enough to handle probably all but the most intense applications.  The keyboard/case is well designed and the velvety grip makes it easy to carry, though the tablet itself feels a little heavier than I was expecting.  I don't believe it's any heavier than similar products, but the slick screen and case along with the dimensions and weight always makes me feel like it's going to slip right out of my hands and land on whatever hard surface is below.  It is most likely that I'm just not used to working with it yet, but it would be nice if those orange sides were made out of some kind of tacky rubber that offered a more sure feeling in the hand.  Overall I'm very happy with the purchase.  I can see products like this quickly making the laptop obsolete."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "This is essentially a fully functional Windows laptop in a small tablet package. The reviews from the folks who received it at a reduced price are pretty much spot on. Our high school aged kids already have the Irulu 10inch, quad core tablets, which they prefer to the iPads their school hands out during class. So, we're fairly familiar with the Irulu brand. When these Windows tablets went on sale, our youngest pooled his allowance money from the past year to buy one. After all, no one else at school has a Windows tablet. He was determined to be the first.\n\nThe Windows 8.1 operating system occupies roughly 9GB of the 32GB hard drive space. After downloading Windows updates, activating the free year of Office 360, and down loading antivirus software, we were left with 13.5GB of free hard drive space. I would highly suggest buying a micro SD for added memory. The tablet accepts up to 128GB cards. No hurry, you have 1 year of free cloud storage. If you're not familiar with Windows 8.1, the learning curve will be difficult. it's a hybrid of Android and Windows. Very busy (confusing). Unlike most tablets, this machine will run your Windows software.\n\nFrom a cold start, takes the tablet about 1 minute to completely boot up. The quad core processor is FAST! Very impressed how fast pages and media from Netflix download and play. The screen on this tablet is leaps and bounds better than Irulu's economy tablets. The screen is beautiful. Viewable from the sides and looks HD (as you would expect). Just a note, there is a thin screen protector with a tab. Remove it. Underneath is a much thicker screen protector. We installed Irulu's glass screen protector for added protection.\n\nYou can play some games on it, even from Steam. But it's not a gaming machine. Online games seem to work fine too. Many apps are available from the Microsoft Store, though nowhere near as many as Android or Apple. The keyboard stand works well from a table or desk, but the magnet is not strong enough to hold them together on your lap. No big issue if you already have a universal 10 inch tablet keyboard. The tablet is rather hefty. Much heavier than the 10inch Android tablet. Built like a tank, really. Battery life is very  good. Get a good 7 hours of normal use. The power supply uses a 2.5mm round plug, which doesn't give you many options for aftermarket adapters. They are available though. If you plan to use the HDMI output, you will need a mini HDMI cable/plug.  There's also one full size USB in addition to a microUSB plug (which comes with a full size USB adapter).\n\nOverall, this is one rather impressive machine in a small package. If you're buying it for a student, may I highly suggest buying an accidental damage policy. While one of our sons have never broken his tablet, our other boys have not been so lucky."}

This is the tablet for you.\nIt also has great response time on surfing the web,playing music,everything was perfect. I made a bigger video that shows the tablet better on YouTube.

Scrolling and navigation is nearly impossible and one click here does not equate to the right motion/action. the screen resolution is too bright and no amount of personaliztion will get rid of the issues posed by the graphics. Response time is delayed by a few seconds so clicking on a link or right clicking for options can get frustration. The over all feel of this product screams made in China, quickly and without much second though. The network card leaves plenty to be desired, no way the quality of the network card lives up to what the description states it can do!

True, the keyboard is not great, but I don't use it -  I bought an Anker bluetooth keyboard, and a TaoTronics stand for it, and they work just fine with the iRulu tablet.  iRulu did NOT pay me to review this tablet, or give me one to review - I paid for it with my own money.  I bought it directly from the iRulu website, where I got a slightly better deal than from Amazon.\nRemember, this is a tablet, not a laptop or a desktop.  I would not run Microsoft Office on it; it just does not have the horsepower for that.  I downloaded the free word processor, AbiWord, and it runs that just fine.  Mainly I use this to read \"books\" (epub and pdf files), and surf the web, and for those tasks it is perfect.  And it is just great for traveling!\nIt is true it does not have a lot of storage, but you can supplement the storage by buying a Micro SD card, just like one you would use for a digital camera.  I bought and installed one (very easy to do), and that is where I keep my \"books\" and photos.  So, this is a good product for the price ... but, if you want to work on heavy duty spreadsheets, or play heavy duty games, this is not the device for it - you should use a laptop or desktop."}

I first thought of something like a Chromebook but, I thought it was a bit limiting so, then I turned to tablets but, she has a Fire tablet already and wanted something with Windows format without breaking the budget so, this popped up in my search. I was a little hesitant at first because, a New, FULL service laptop with Windows 10, for under $200 ???  looked too good to be true so, after some research I figured, what have I got too lose! 2 days later it arrived and I decided to set it up for her. OK, first off, I have been using computers since the Commodore VIC-20 and the first PC I actually bought for myself was a Gateway 2000 back in the day. I have used just about every make and format of computer and destroyed a few along the way so, I am no novice. During setup, I was amazed that this was as good as it is. I kept shaking my head at the fact that this ultra lite little bugger not only was faster than expected it did everything I wanted it to do. She used it over the past few days and aside from the fact that the built in mouse pad is very sensitive, it was fast, no buffering on videos and no freeze up's plus the Battery life was great! Now keep in mind I still have to put is some more tests but, she loves it and that all that matters. If this continues to be more than expected then you can also expect it not to be my last iRULU!"}

Out of the box, it was ready to run, very responsive and I fell in love with it. it's replaced my old netbook.  I have noticed some of the heating that other users have commented on and I attribute that to the fact that you are running a fast processor in a nearly enclosed environment. Battery life is great, even with running a couple of social media apps in the background.\nMy immediate issue was the removable keyboard. The mouse-pad is a little too sensitive for my taste and depending on where I accidentally drag my thumbs I inadvertently open the Windows Action Center or restore down the window that I'm working with. It can be quite exasperating at times. The only USB port is very tight when connecting devices, as others have mentioned, and the equipped power cord could be a lot longer.\nThis would be an excellent device for an older student or adult needing a mobile windows unit, I don't think it would hold up to much rough usage though."}

I am sorry that you had such a hard time with\n getting ahold of your company. But unfortunately we no\n longer have the prime warranty. Please let me know if you\n need anything else or have anymore questions. Thank you for\n your patience and understanding.\"\n\n- so this means their \"standard warranty\" applies - which means that if anything goes wrong or is defective within the first year - even if it arrives DOA - YOU are responsible for shipping charges and will have to pay 50% of the cost of the tablet to get it repaired. THIS IS NOT AN ACCEPTABLE WARRANTY POLICY.\n\n***********\nThis is my second Walknbook 10\" tablet - my first one lasted about a year before the screen broke (I actually put packing tape across the screen and disabled the touch feature and still use it), I was very happy with that earlier model and so wanted to reorder the exact same thing. Unfortunately the current model is slightly different and most of the changes aren't really improvements. I was hoping to get it in all black, but apparently that is no longer an option, you must chose from a selection of day-glo accent colors that make the tablet look more like a toy than a serious piece of hardware. The detachable keyboard has changed from the sturdy snap-in type to a flimsy one incorporated into a case/stand (it can NOT be used separately) which has a different connector that the old one and is not compatible. The magnetic connection is very iffy and doesn't seem to stay connected, instead preferring to connect/disconnect repeatedly popping up the info box asking you to switch from tablet mode every few seconds until you disable it. The one year trial Office365 subscription has been reduced to a 30day trial, so I think I'll go for LibreOffice or Open Office instead - both ran fine on my old Walknbook. The Walkinbook is very responsive and seems to run most apps well, have not had any issues in that respect but it does seem to randomly turn on and off by itself while in use. The other thing I noticed is that the green bezel seems to be messed up on the left side with the ports - it is like it doesn't fit right so it is loose and won't completely snap back into place.\n\nOverall it is still a good value for the money but it does have some flaws that you can work around with some settings and purchasing a separate Bluetooth keyboard. It should also be noted that it is vitally important that you leave a positive review of the product within 30 days of purchase to be eligible for the \"Prime\" one-year warranty, I failed to do this with my last one and was stuck when I started having problems within a few months."}

It's perfectly capable of doing everything I'd want from a laptop such as browsing the web and using microsoft word. The battery is pretty good with it lasting between 6 and 8 hours depending on what I'm doing. The biggest issue I find myself facing is the storage space. For a computer 32gb isn't much and after updates you'll only have about 18 left. I highly recommend utilizing the micro sd card slot to expand your storage. On the subject of specs this will not handle very many games. With only 2gb of RAM and 1.33ghz processor with integrated graphics it's fine with stuff like candy crush or some of the other mobile game ports on the windows store, but that's about it.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "UPDATE: I am unable to solve the battery dying issue. Unless it is plugged in it will continue to discharge as if it were being used. I ran a quick benchmark score if your interested [...]\nFor the benchmark I had it plugged in and ended all applications. There seems to be some kind of CPU throttling I am unable to disable. Power management settings are tightly controlled. I can no longer recommend this tablet for any purpose.\n\nI received this tablet as a gift for Christmas. The item came in a new box with what appeared to be a new keyboard. The tablet itself is a different story. The tablet is obviously used. On the back side it has three pieces of velcro stuck to it. The front side is dirty, like someone spilled something on the screen. I think it has a screen protector on it because I can see bubbles however, it seems like its so stuck to the tablet, I fear I will damage the screen trying to remove it. Its almost like its melted on.\n\nThe tablet itself was completely dead requiring charging before I powered it on. Once I got it on I was welcomed with a login screen with a username already set up. I tried to tap the username to login however, I found the touchscreen didn't work.....Then I moved onto the mouse....The track pad is so sensitive I was constantly sliding open the notification menu on the tablet. Tapping the touch pad is hit or miss whether or not it actually clicks. Pressing it down will give you a tactile click you can actually feel however, It requires to so much force to push, you typically end up moving the pointer away from whatever it was you were trying to click. I inspected the drivers and found it does not have the appropriate drivers to operate the touch pad. You are not able to disable the track pad gestures, leaving you to deal with the notification tray constantly opening or activating the multiple desktop gestures without any way to stop it.\n\nOnce I logged in I found the desktop had software installed already. Specifically software that operated a Key Cutting Machine....Not sure how to react to that other than it is an obviously used device. Further digging into the computer I found personal information dating back to May of 2016. So aside from the actual device being sub par so far....It has been in use for some time now.\n\nOnce I got past that info, The device began telling me it was running out of space and needed to delete the old copy of windows still present on the machine.......So you get it......Its a used computer.....moving on.......\n\nThe touchscreen began working after a few restarts but I was able to replicate the problem by allowing it to drain completely and then charging it. Every time I powered it on after the first startup from being completely dead, the touchscreen did not function.\n\nOther things I noticed was the volume button appears to be upside down. Up makes the volume go down and vice versa.\n\nThe device does not seem to sleep properly. Every time I put it into sleep or hibernate mode, I come back to it being dead because it doesn't actually power down. Not sure if that is an inherit problem with the tablet or something resulting from the previous user but either way, i'm not interested in solving it.\n\nBattery life wasn't great either. For light usage I averaged around 4 hours from fully charged to dead.\n\nI noticed the 32bit version of windows 10 was installed rather than the more efficient 64bit version. This is typically resulting from upgrading rather than a clean install so again....may be the former user to fault here. FYI the computer does support 64bit version of windows by having a 64bit processor (Intel Atom Z3735F in case you wondering).\n\nThe bundled keyboard is a highlight here. It has a very satisfying click when you \"dock\" the tablet to the keyboard and works very quickly. When the entire package is folded up its very easy to transport and very easy to deploy. It does not have any light to indicate if the caps/num/scrl lock are activated.\n\nAll the ports seemed to work without issue and having a full size usb is always great.\n\nThe speakers are not mind blowing but they do the job well. I play HD video on YouTube with no problem. 360 video was to much for it.\n\nI would of love to see it have some kind of magnetic switch to turn off the tablet when you closed up the keyboard case. Otherwise, unless you put it into sleep or shut it down when you close it, it remains on indefinitely (minus power settings you may or may not have set up.)\n\nOverall, for the money, the tablet is good. If you understand its limitations and are looking for a usable workbook that can do a little more AND your willing to fiddle with it to fix some of the annoyances, your in luck. For the price it is an acceptable buy. My biggest complaint here is how this obviously used tablet got recycled back into sales and no one thought to even glance at it. The fact that it has windows 10 is an obvious red flag. iRulu knows windows 10 is not a viable option on this device and have acknowledged it. If you can afford maybe fifty more dollars, a wide range of VERY capable tablets opens up to you, most likely without the silly problems listed here. If not, this tablet can function well as a light productivity machine. If your an avid user of Google Docs like me, but like to have the power of a complete windows machine, this will fit the bill."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "While I'd been expecting that replacing the keyboard case would be necessary on occasion, I had expected the tablet itself to last longer than it has.  I've owned this for just barely a year - it was ordered 16 December 2015 on Amazon - and my WalknBook has died.  Coincidental with the anniversary of this online purchase I began to have a battery problem.  My tablet was off and fully charged.  A few days passed before the next time I needed to use it, but as it used to be I expected the battery to still be at (or near) 100%.  Instead I found it was at 0%.  Connecting to to AC power I saw a red battery status icon and a \"charge check failure\" message.  A few attempts were required, but I was able to charge the table again.  Once charged it seemed to work normally.  To test it I made sure it was fully charged and turned off, and then let it sit for a couple of days.  I once more found the battery down to zero afterwards.  This time I did not get the \"charge check failure\" message and the tablet recharged to full.\n\nDuring the time I've owned the tablet I've observed that the LED light near the camera would come on briefly as part of the normal shutdown process.  I did not see that LED come on during shutdown for what would be the second time the device fast-discharged to 0% battery.  Once the battery was charged again and the tablet was running I disabled Win10's Fast Startup to see what effect that might have.  That would appear to have helped avoid the battery fast-discharging, as the tablet seems to have worked normally again - until late December 26th - when my WalknBook would no longer power up at all.\n\nThese issues have been reported to iRulu, though the results so far are disappointing"}

The one that will not turn on I played with the power switch and after 15 minutes it turned on some how, don't know how and why.\n\nAfter initial set up the machines work decent.  They connect to where I need to connect.  The sound quality is fairly decent.  I don's think that that these computers are useful for anything worthwhile other than playing an listening to music.  The picture quality of the cameras is not good.  It is what these things were 15 years ago.  Less than acceptable.  There is no comparison of the picture quality with any phone camera.  Th phone camera pictures are fantastic.\n\nI bought two bluetooth mice.  One from Microsoft and the other from UHURU.  First I connected the Microsoft mouse with Bluetooth.  It connected all right.  Then the surprise.  Start a web browser and it is really slow and does not even work  The bluetooth is interfering with the wireless network and makes it non functional.  Turn off the bluetooth and everything works.  The same happened with the other mouse from UHURU.  It is confirmed that the \"g\" wireless network will be killed by the bluetooth.  So no blue tooth devices on these machines.  Forget about a high quality bluetooth speaker..\n\nThe design is good, the weight is decent, not very light but OK.  The screen is responsive with on screen keyboard.\n\nI don't plan on using this for much worthwhile use except for listening youtube an some web browsing.\n\nThe bluetooth not working was a great surprise.  I have dot encountered this situation with any computer, yet.  So please don't use any bluetooth devices.\n\nFor now I am giving this one star.

It is super sleek and runs surprisingly fast even with several tabs open. Chrome runs well, and installations like Spotify and Skype download and install quickly. It's lightweight and really thin and its great for everything. It's easy to carry around with a bunch of books and battery life is amazing. I can usually use it for about 8 hours before it needs to be charged. The only thing I dislike about it is that the white gets dirty pretty easily, but I mean it's white what did I expect? But it only takes a paper towel or just your finger to quickly wipe it off. The cameras also not that great, but it's about the same quality as a Mac. I often get a lot of compliments about this laptop and I'm just really glad I got it. It's light, it's sleek, it's fast, and best of all, it's cheap!\n\nJust for some basic information, it has the charger, a USB port, and an HDMI port on the left side and another USB port, a headphone jack, and a micro SD card slot on the right. The laptop comes with the charger that is compatible with most outlets. The keyboard is not flexible, which is good and the keypad is absolutely huge with gives you a lot of precision. The power button is part of the keyboard right above the backspace, which can get a bit confusing but it takes two long clicks to shut it off- one click is sleep.

Tried another IRULU charger and nothing.  So contacted them and it was again replaced.  Well that replacement has lasted like 7 - 8 months and this one is no longer charging.

The trackpad works perfectly, and you can click hard on it or do a light tap or simply touch the screen. I used all ways, depending on what I was doing and where my hands were. You can also move around with the arrow keys on the keyboard. When I wished to type something, like a URL, I merely touched the address bar and began typing, hitting the return key when finished\n=The unit can even be charged two ways: Plug in the power supply cable, or connect the tablet via USB to your computer. And since it uses so little power, it doesn't burn up your lap when you're watching a movie\n=The system is much lighter than your typical laptop, and less troublesome to hold\n=Bringing up the web browser seems much faster than my experience with other Android tablets\n=It is priced attractively in competition with the so-called netbooks which have few of the tablet features and flexibility\n\nOverall, I found it easy to use, create documents, spreadsheets, etc., play video, slide shows of pictures, music, and on and on. The lightness, low power, and overall ease of use make it a favorite on the couch for quick reference and in the bedroom for late night browsing.\n\nAny Problems?\n\n1. The tablet does not come with Google Play installed, and I could not install it from Google's web site. I was able to use the Amazon app store, but not the Google app store. I searched for the Google Play app on the Amazon site but it was nowhere to be found. So that's one down side.\n2. The tablet comes with Kindle preinstalled. I tried every way I could think of, but could never get it to work. It refused to download even a single book, and since it was preinstalled, there is no way of deleting the software and replacing it to fix the problem. That is not acceptable, but I can't fault Irulu for that problem, that's an Android problem which is one of the many reasons I prefer almost any operating system to Android. It acts like software designed as a giveaway that is never properly fixed or supported.\n\nSo if you are comfortable with Android and actually like it, then you will be happy with this tablet; its hardware is simply excellent. Your only complaints will be related to Android itself, as mine are. Good Luck."}

I was\nexpecting the keyboard to be almost useless but I thought, I am buying the tablet, not the keyboard.  The case the keyboard\ncame in was designed in a very smart manner and it holds the the tablet up without any other hardware and the keyboard itself very nice.\nThe device itself also works very well.  It came with Windows 8.1 but since then I have upgraded to Windows 10 (free upgrade\nwhen it was available) Windows 10 performs very nicely on the unit.\n\nIs it the fastest device I have ever used? No!  And, it was not designed to be. It's a tablet.  I have my 3Ghz desktop with gaming\nvideo card and 16GB of RAM.  This is my tablet.  I use it as a tablet when I am out and about.  I mainly edit word and excel documents,\nuse it as an image editor, check Facebook and e-mail and general internet research.  It does not replace my gaming machine at home.\n\nThe drawbacks of the device are these 2 things.\n\nThe battery lasts a little over 4 hours on a full charge.  My Nokia 2520 can do over 6 hours on a full charge.  So, even though this is a\nthicker device, the battery doesn't last as long.  And, number 2.  It has a problem with powered devices in the USB port like an external\nUSB hard drive or an external USB speaker.  After a few minutes using either one and the device cuts off.  I think the USB port is\nunder powered and it's starts to draw too much current which causes it to shut off.  The solution has been to use a powered USB\nhub for these devices and then it's fine.  I can use like a USB mouse or keyboard or memory key, though, without any problems.\nI am assuming they use a lot less power.\n\nFor these 2 issues I gave it 4 stars.  But, I still enjoy the tablet and I use it all the time especially at work."}

I ordered tablets from this company before and I have to say while eventually you get something functioning, it is not before few glitches and exchanges along the way. Certainly good ideas of products but half baked. Now this product. Received the laptop and looked impressive. The battery was almost fully charged but left it on charge for few hours before use anyway. Fired it up and started setting until the battery ran out while the charger is connected (strange). Then DEAD, Absolutely DEAD. Tried to charge over and over again over night, no it wouldn't. That was after I purchased Microsoft Office and half installed it before the thing went dead. So, you can say Dead On Arrival and is returned for refund."}

So for the style and look the laptop gets five stars especially if you have always wanted a Mac Book but NEVER had those kind of funds like myself. The style is very sleek and it gives off the whole apple sleekness. Past that you really care about performance and that where the stars drop. So the first day everything was running smooth on the second day, I was browsing the web and a blue screen came up stating that the system isn't running properly and will shut down and restart for me. Well the computer just went black after that and needless to say it didn't really ever start back up. I ended up having to hold the power down for a minute after attempting to already do this a few times, the computer finally shut down and I just kept it off for the night. Other downfalls with the PC is the mouse pad is SUPER sensitive; however, there is an option to turn off your mouse pad (which I did) and I just connected the old school mouse pad to it. The installed IE has a few glitches, a good work around with that would be to just download an alternate browser which some people do regardless. All in all I would only pay 150 or under for the computer because, you are mostly paying for the look. The actual processing and performance is not worth more than that price."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "The sub $200 price tag is a major part of this being a 4 star device. For under $200 this is a fine machine.\n__________________\n\nGENERAL USABILITY\n\nAs an every day web browsing email machine, it works great. The keyboard and touchpad are responsive. Typing goes very well without lag or missed characters. The keyboard is easy to type on with big keys that have a decent amount of key travel (how far the key depresses when pushed)\n\nOne key I like the set up of in particular is the power key. It's right on the keyboard in the upper right hand corner. This is becoming more and more common in notebooks. On some machines the power button has a hair trigger that gets REALLY annoying since it's right next to the commonly used backspace key. But on this one the power button requires a 2 second press to trigger it. That's both to turn the machine on and turn it off. So there is no accidentally turning it off while typing.\n\nThe wifi works very well. I was able to get download speeds of 26 megabits per second (This will obviously depend on your internet provider, but the machine is capable of handling that speed), and streaming full HD video ran fine without lag. To test this I watched full HD video on YouTube and through Amazon Prime. In both cases the video streamed flawlessly and was in sync with the audio.\n\nIt's very thin and light weight. Its thicker than my ASUS Zenbook ultrabook, but not much thicker. It's still VERY portable.\n\nThe battery life is phenomenal. The product description above claims 6 to 8 hours running time. In reality I find 8 hours to be a minimum. The battery life is really strong.\n__________________\n\nSPECIFIC USABILITY\n\nGeneral web browsing isn't an issue at all. It's more than capable of keeping up with web surfing.\n\nI installed LibreOffice to give it a run at basic office type work. (LibreOffice is a free open source package that does all the same stuff that Microsoft Office does.) It ran all of that stuff fine. Basic spreadsheeting, word processing, none of is was a problem.\n\nIt runs a full version of Windows 10 that shows as authenticated in settings, and more importantly it allows for normal Windows updates. If it was a pirated version of Windows it might look authentic, but updates wouldn't work. (Windows 10 doesn't really have piracy issues anymore anyway as Microsoft distributes the OS cheaply or free now and relies on it's app store for revenue rather than selling Windows. But just to clarify, this version is authentic.)\n\nOverall for basic every day use the processor keeps up well.\n__________________\n\nSOFTWARE IT CAN'T DO\n\nFor higher end applications you'll find this doesn't quite keep up. Anything that involves graphical rendering like Photoshop (Or the open source alternative I use called GIMP) works but is slow to do more intensive operations.\n\nThings like high end gaming are completely out of the question. The processor just doesn't have the horsepower to be a gaming system. It''ll play a really basic game okay, but really high games are just not going to work at all. It's just not a gaming platform.\n\nI tried to run an Ubuntu build of Linux just to see if this would make a decent Linux machine. The machine has all the specs Ubuntu recommends aside form the processor. Ubuntu recommends a 2 GHz minimum, where this machine has a 1.33 GHz processor. However, I was unable to get Ubuntu to boot form a USB stick or DVD disc (using a separate DVD drive, not included with this system) as the system BIOS isn't set up to allow for booting from USB devices. You can select the option to boot from USB in the BIOS, but it just doesn't work. It never polls the USB in the boot sequence. So setting up Ubuntu on the machine didn't get off the ground for me.\n__________________\n\nSTORAGE SPACE\n\nOut of the box the internal storage has about 19 GB free space available (after Windows and other installed software uses up some). There is no bloatware to speak of. If you expand the storage using a micro SD card, the card sits fully inside the machine without sticking out at all. So you can keep a micro SD card installed all the time without worrying about it breaking off from sticking out too far. For that matters it's actually a little difficult to get the card out, which I didn't consider to be a bad thing as there is no chance it would accidentally pop out and get lost.\n__________________\n\nSOUND\n\nThe speakers are a little underpowered. It's not an issue with headphones, but the built in speakers are not very loud. The sound fine, but they aren't loud. They are more than adequate for system sounds and warning alarms and such, but I wouldn't want to watch a movie using the system speakers. You'd want to use headphones to get better audio.\n__________________\n\nDISPLAY\n\nThe real weakness of this machine, even for run of the mill use, is the screen. It's viewing angles are poor. When viewing head on it's pretty good. It's bright and clear. But it really has to be viewed head on. When moving left and right you have some flexibility, but not much. When moving up and down though the screen becomes hard to view very quickly. With the machine priced at $175 this is forgivable, but still slightly annoying. If the price ever increases to above $200 the low viewing angles on the screen would become a deal killer.\n\nThe 1366 x 768 resolution sounds low, but on a 14 inch screen it's not too shabby. You can get a much higher resolution screen on a notebook, but it'll also cost a lot more. For daily use, the lower resolution isn't an issue at all. Everything is crisp and clear. It's just the viewing angles that get you.\n\nThe color depth of the screen is a little muted, which looks great for HD video, but lacks pop for colorful still images. (Video looks better without overly saturated colors. Still images and graphics tend to look better with more color saturation. It's a tradeoff either way.)\n__________________\n\nBOTTOM LINE\n\nUltimately if you need a low cost machine for regular use this will work out fine if you can live with the screen. It's not a high end device that will do super fancy stuff. That's the bottom line.\n\nIf the price ever rises above the $200 mark it probably is less of an overall value.\n\nI was sent a sample of this product for the purpose of reviewing it."}

We did have issues with some programs we ran but these seemed to be mainly errors in programming for the 'apps' we loaded, rather than being caused by the device. After we 'trained ourselves', we we able to use the device properly. So far, so good."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "Don't take the 4 star review as a deal breaker; I've had this thing for over a year now, and I really enjoy it.  There ARE a few shortcomings that I'll go into and let you be aware of, but it really shouldn't keep you from buying this or a similar product from iRULU (I originally bought this for $200, if you look around you can find new models for a little bit less now, be sure to consider your options!)\n\nI'll give the device its praise and then follow up with the issues next.  This little device has endured daily use and still operates at it's normal speed. I think a lot of it can be credited to it's tablet hybrid build, which allows it to have a flash drive, instead of having moving parts.  Speaking of which, also allows it to have a INCREDIBLE boot up speed.  If you need to restart your device, it'll take all but an actual minute or less.\n\nThe device can play videos well, including HD resolutions on Youtube, but if you're aiming for 60fps on some of the options, you'll be pushing it.  The sound on the speakers is good as well; they can play loud and clear if you wanna show off a video to your friends or family.  You can also play some video games on it, although nothing too advanced.  Stick with the classic 2D games, or ones with minimal 3D elements, as this thing only has 2gb of ram.\n\nWhile I never really used the thing for all of it's potential, it's been able to do what I love the most, and that's simply browsing the internet and watching videos.  This makes it fun to use both the keyboard, and gestures.  It also allows it to make up lost ground on some of it's shortcomings.\n\nSome things to be aware of which may minorly inconvenience you:\n\n-The keyboard's touchpad doesn't have a scroll section, so you'll have to rely on the gestures to scroll.  I've tried to use the two finger scrolling method but had difficulty nailing down the finesse in it.  If you can already do that, more power to you.  Otherwise, you may find yourself scrolling with the Fn+Up/Down keys, and maybe fine tuning what you're scrolling for with the touch screen.\n\n-The keyboard works well, but the touchpad can be overly sensitive at times. I've had a common situation where the palm of my hand will skirt along the touch pad when I type, quickly making me select all the text I'm typing in and erase it\n\n-While there is a headphones port, there is no mic port.  The device comes with a built in-mic, but like all built-in mics they're very bare minimum with sound quality.  Mics only operating on a USB port will have no problem, but otherwise you may need to obtain an adapter.\n\n-Be aware that the attachable keyboard is the only thing keeping your tablet from falling on its back.  In plenty of scenarios the thing can very weak to physics, especially since it will take up slightly more surface space than a laptop to do so.  Make sure it has enough space so it doesn't fall off.  Because the thing isn't that sturdy unless it's on a flat surface, you can't really take it with you on your lap.  You'll need a proper setup unless you're good with typing in tablet format.\n\n-The connectors can be a little finicky for the keyboard.  Sometimes it'll disconnect and then I can't have it recognize that it's attached again, making me need to restart.  Thankfully the restart times are short.\n\n-The battery has potential to drain quickly.  Like a lot of lithium batteries, be sure to keep it from draining completely but also not leaving it charging all the time keep the battery life lasting longer.  Eventually it may just be easier to keep it plugged in and set in a designated space.\n\nDespite these shortcomings, I've been able to adapt to them and use the device for simple entertainment use.  The storage size is a bit limited so be sure to only save the essentials on it and keep the rest of your data in an external source.  Like I said, I've had this thing for over a year, keeping it on most of the time as well, just putting it into sleep mode when not using it.  The thing is fast but be sure not to over encumber it, as it only has 2gb of ram.  Keep your goals and tasks simple and one at a time and it'll cooperate.\n\nIf you're considering a laptop to start off with, you should definitely consider this one or its siblings.  Because it's basically a tablet with a desktop OS, you get the advantages of a quick startup time, along with eliminating depreciating factors of moving parts such as fans or storage discs.  It'll last you a good time for the price and give you access to all the essentials of computer/internet entertainment!"}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "From a customer viewpoint I must give irulu a very poor mark.  Although I liked the performance of the w10 laptop and their customer service is polite and considerate , they get a zero in their ability to handle even the most simple repair.  I can not turn the device on because of a broken pushbutton on the on/off switch.  This is customer replaceable with a part costing pennies. They claim to have no spare parts and no spare computers but will replace my device if I send it in.  How can they do this with no spare parts or additional computers.  I have explained that since I can not turn the device on I can't erase all personal information.  I allso believe that my device will not be the only one to experience a problem.  How will they support all of these customers?  The net result for me and perhaps other customers is that I must destroy the device to protect against identy theft , for lack of customer support,  and the device is only two months old.  CUSTOMERS beware and ask beforeyou purchase anything from irulu that they will support the device.\nJack Rebman"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "I got this roughly around five months ago and so far I've been reasonably happy with it for what it cost. There are some buyer beware comments I have on it, however. ( The first comments are negative(ish) but PLEASE, if you're going to use this review to decide whether or not you're going to purchase this, read it all the way through.)\n\nFirst off, you'll want buy two things with this ( or ASAP ), screen protectors and a micro SD card and/or some form of external hard-drive.\n-This tablet ( as noted with other reviews ) comes with three screen protectors: one on the back and two on the front ( a thin pull off one and thicker one below ). The keyboard this comes with ended up scratching up the thicker front one pretty badly, but as long as it's cleaned semi-regularly, you can still see through to the screen and have no issues with responsiveness. However, if you're picky about things, get screen protectors. Mine were installed slightly off on both sides when I received it. Not too badly on the front but badly enough on the back that I had to remove it eventually because it started peeling off.\n-The memory on this thing is horrendously small for anyone who wants to use any amount of apps or programs on it. It didn't take me long to figure out that an SD card was in order and trust me, you'll need it. You'll also probably run into lag problems with high-resource gobbling programs ( It's a sensitive tablet after all, but it does more than I had originally expected it to. )\n\nAs far as durability goes, it's okay. You'll want to watch out for the sides mostly if you're abusive ( as I am ) to your electronics. I dropped it once and the right hand top corner of the case cracked ( I can still use it, I just have to be a bit more careful when manhandling it ) . ( BTW, there's a mystery port hiding under it. iRulu won't say what it is, but if y'all figure it out, please share! ). I also cracked the back panel while cleaning it because I had it sitting in it's little prop-up case.... So if you need to clean it, lay it down flat and WATCH THE AMOUNT OF PRESSURE you put into it ( Don't even know my own strength, apparently... ).\n\nAs noted as well in other reviews, the back can get a bit warm/hot when charging or in use when it's warm out, which can cause a bit of lag. Not hot enough to burn up but it's noticeable. If you're smart, you'll have a tiny fan to blow on the back of it. If not, be attentive and take it off the case/keyboard to let it cool down a bit.\n\nCharging it while using it is.... let's face it, a bit hopeless. Let's say you're down to fifty percent and decide to plug it in while still using it, you'll get an estimated time to full charge of about five hours plus (nope...not joking at all about this... ). Your best bet is to keep a somewhat close eye on how much power you use and turn it off while charging to allow it a faster charge. If you don't mind being tethered, then by all means, drain away my friend. I found that the run time isn't too bad, however. So long as you're not watching videos and the like, you'll probably get about a (really rough guestimate here. I'll add a more accurate time at a later date ) five hour run time on it.\n\nI could not, for the life of me, get the micro usb plug to plug in and work with this thing....and I don't think I'm the only one with this problem either ( talking about the cable it comes with...). Works nicely for my phone though, so bonus?\n\nWhat I found is that I really needed a mouse for this... My keyboard's track pad had issues. If you're only using it to light-tap-click, it's fine, but using the actual left hand button made my cursor run all over the place, though the left one is alright. This is easily possibly only my issue, but all the same, I'd recommend a separate mouse. They keyboard also feels a little thin but it's still okay on solid surfaces. I can use this on my lap but only when placed carefully, otherwise it will either fall off or cave in ( the back prop, I mean.).\n\nI do love the fact that this is so light-weight ( in comparison to my brick of a laptop ), which makes running around with it all the more enjoyable and doesn't make me cringe as much when I have to hike up large hills.\n\nThe cams aren't bad either, though I haven't tested them out enough to tell you one way or the other if that'll be a make or break for anyone. Mic isn't horrible but isn't great either.\n\nWindows 10 on works more smoothly than I had anticipated. You can now install apps straight onto the SD card which makes this all function MUCH better than when I originally got it and the option was yet to be available.\n\nNote : I will get more extensively into details when I can manage to think of them later. I plan on making an update to this over time. I also cannot comment of the customer service.\n\nSo, I give this a four out of five because for the price, this is a reasonably worth while buy. It functions pretty well with some quirks here and there, but they're all manageable. All in all, I'd suggest this for those on a tight budget who want a small and portable computer that isn't too small and isn't too huge."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "I am a technology junkie.  In fact, my four kids are the same way so we have a lot of electronic devices in our houses.  We have multiple computers, tablets, and other items.  They get used every day.  When I received this tablet/computer, I had a lot of devices to compare it to.\n\nThe first thing I noticed when I took this tablet out of the box was that it didn't feel like a cheap tablet or laptop.  The tablet has a heavy feel to it similar to the Microsoft Surface.  This tablet/computer was easy to set up and was running in just a few minutes.  The tablet has a 10-inch screen and the screen is a little different than my other 10 inch ones.  My others are very long and narrow.  This one is still rectangular but not quite so narrow.\n\nThis tablet comes with a detachable keyboard that also serves as a case and stand.  Now I am will be honest, the stand part is not my favorite.  It stands the screen up to straight for me.  I would like for it to have a little more of a tilt to it.  The keyboard is a typical size you would see with a tablet this size.  I have others with this same size keyboard and none are my favorite keyboards.  I am so used to a regular size laptop keyboard that these others seem too small.  So when I am at home, I have been using a larger Bluetooth keyboard and stand with this tablet because its closer to the size of my laptop keyboard and I find it easier to use.  The keyboard that comes with this tablet is responsive and the keys are easy to use, just smaller.\n\nSo let me tell you what really impressed me with this tablet and why I gave it 5 stars even though I just told you the keyboard and stand are not my favorites.  So these are the things I really love about this tablet:\n\n Windows 10  This little tablet/computer has full Windows 10 operating system installed on it.  This is my biggest complaint about my Microsoft Surface 2 because it only has Windows RT which is not a full version of Windows and is frustrating.  With Window 10, I can download and Windows App or other programs.  Windows 10 runs smooth and fast on this tablet.  I have not had any trouble with it freezing, lagging or locking down.\n\n Microsoft Office Mobile  This tablet comes with Microsoft Office programs already installed  Word, PowerPoint, Excel.  For me this was extremely important so that I can work on this device.  I have used Word to create and edit documents and PowerPoint to create, edit and present presentations.  I have been able to take documents created on another device and edit them on this device.  I could not have been more excited when I found out that they were already on here.  The description says that it is a trial subscription but mine are still working great and it has not asked me to continue the subscription.\n\n Expandable Storage  My biggest complaint with tablets is that you are stuck with the internal storage and don't have options for more storage.  This device has several options.  You can use a USB jump/flash drive with this because it has a full size USB port.  There is also a micro SD port. This was my preference of storage. I can put the micro SD card in and leave it, no losing it.  This was a huge deal for me.  I need a device I can upload and store pictures, documents, etc.  and have enough room.  This option for external storage gave me that.\n\n An extremely responsive screen  Again we have a lot of touchscreen devices and I have home that really impress me and others that are lacking.  This one so far has been great.  The screen is very responsive to touch and so far no trouble at all with it.  The screen has great colors.  I typically with a device like this want to use a keyboard but with this one, I have been typing on the screen with ease.\n\n Battery  This tablet/computer charges quickly and has a good battery.  Obviously it depends on what you are doing but if I am just working not watching videos, etc. I can get 8-10 hours out of this device.  That is longer than a lot of my other tablets.\n\n Fast processor  I have done a lot of different things with this device from streaming videos to PowerPoint presentations.  It has a fast processor and runs smoothly.  It opens files quickly and opens web pages fast.\n\nSo overall, I am happy.  I am not an IT person but can tell you from my experience using this tablet, its great so far.  This offers me an affordable option in what is basically a small laptop.  I prefer taking something like this with me when I travel over a full size laptop.  I have a Microsoft Surface II and did a lot of comparisons between the two. This one, in its price range, is definitely a good competitor for the Surface.\n\nProduct provided as a free promotional sample in exchange for my evaluation and my honest, unbiased review."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "My small Asus had been recently dying on me. I work 10hrs a day at a very very slow job. So usually I have anywhere from 5 to 9 hours with nothing to do. I NEED a laptop for entertainment or I would go crazy. The little Asus one 10in I have is a few years old but still need what I needed too. Watch movies, write documents and make small 5m videos. Perfect. So that's what I kept in mind when looking for a new one.\n\nI love this thing. Granted I only got it yesterday and I'm still figuring some things out but it looks and feels great perfect weight, nice and sleek. I thought my biggest problem would be the 32gb hardrive which ends up being only 28 after software preinstalled. I've already got Windows essentials (movie maker, photo viewer and messenger) along with 3 over 2 hour movies, 2 seasons of a TV show, star wars Jedi academy and OBS (screen recording software) and I still have 8.5 GB free. I'll probably spend the $20 for the 64GB though just so I can keep more movies/shows on hand without dragging my external around. Just cause I'm lazy.\n\nI waited the full 10hrs before using it for the first time and the install and logging in was super easy. I don't necessarily like Windows 10 but it's not my main  computer. Its a nice orange color, and the screen comes with a screen protector already on it. I haven't noticed the keys scratching the protector yet but I'll update the review in a month or so. The webcams work perfectly. The mic picks ups all background noise so it's not usable really but what did you expect? You can download a free app that works like a professional for free on your phone. Everything is 1080. It's so crisp.\n\nThe only reason I'm not giving it 4 stars is because after I installed some programs I restarted it but it got stuck, or I'm impatient, on the restart screen. (Took over 5m) so I held down the power button until the screen went off then let go. Then pressed and held down till it came back on then there hasn't been an issue since.\n\nSome people complained it gets hot when charging. 1. You should use it while it's charging, bad for the battery. 2. I used a packet of tissues to life up one side and it got enough air to keep it super cool.\n\nThis is great for its price. If you intend on doing heavy gaming I wouldn't get this. You will fry it. If you want movies or writing or making movies/drawing or what have you this is perfect. :) I would buy it again. I'll update this review in a month to let you know if there are any changes. I was really starting to get put off by the negative reviews even though the positive ones shined so bright but I'm glad I made the purchase. Having a little computer knowledge helps when keeping things in working condition."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "I purchased this tablet because I like to play old school games, I got a tri-pod setup and a bluetooth controller. I was using a 7 inch tablet and wanted something a little bigger. It's fast, like advertised. Even though it has only 1gig of ram it still runs great. Although 2gigs would have given the octa-core some more room to breath. For those wondering exactly which gpu it has, it's a powervr sgx544 mp2 (duel core) which clocks about 300-500mhz, not confuse the Gpu with the Cpu, the cpu is an octa-core I believe with each core running 1.2 to 1.4ghz a piece. I've read a lot of bad reviews about the ips screen angles but that's only when you lean it towards you with the top of the tablet (where the camera is) comming towards you. Say if you put it on a folio or a stand, it looks great, you can even pretty much lie it flat and it still looks great, like a full viewing angle rotating one way, if that makes any sence (pretty much what you use a tablet for). I've tried some 3d games from google play like beach buggy racing. I was surprised that it ran so well with the sgx544 it looked great and was really smooth. An awesome feature about this tablet is the hdmi out. I have two other game players that seem to lag and struggle with that no matter what setting I use, the x1s lightning shows frame for frame with no lag, video or controller input, awesome!! Netflix looks great but youtube for some reason doesn't work, it just keeps resetting the video. I think it has to do with the video codecs and the octa-core, i'm sure there will be an update to youtube eventually that will fix that. Also if anyone is a fan of the kemco rpgs like me, there pretty much not compatible with this, I haven't tried most of them i'm sure some of them will work but some of the newer ones are black screen. Also because of the resolution text looks grainy, but it's not that big of a deal, the color temp and saturation is great, and there is no screen bleeding. Battery life is pretty good, considering. Enough to where you can get carried away and forgot that you have to eventually charge it, not like an old laptop. I'm actually writing this review on the x1s with a usb keyboard and 2.4ghz wireless mouse plugged into a micro us hub. If that's something you would like to do keep in mind that you need a powered hub (you can use a power stick) because otg usb is not self powerd (for most devices). For the price that this is I think it's fantastic and am blown away by what kind of bang for you buck you can get."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "First, you should know that I bought this unit. I did *not* receive it as a giveaway, or product evaluation.  I bought it because I have two Microsoft Surface RTs, which I bought primarily to use for word processing and also to do use two websites that are somewhat sophisticated--udemy.com, which I use to host several on-line courses that I write and upwork.com, which I use to hire and communicate with subcontracts. What motivated me to upgrade was that Microsoft would not upgrade the Internet Explorer version on the Surface RTs. Consequently, as the sites installed the latest and greatest technology, I became more and more frustrated.  It took forever to do simple things, if I could do them at all.\n\nI upgraded to the SurfacePro, but found that it was not very good at making videos for me, despite the price which for the high-end models was over $2,000.  I sent it back and tried a Hewlett Packard tablet, which worked fairly well for everything by video, but at a price over $2.000, I was not enamored when it took me longer to generate a video file on that computer than it did on an old desktop.\n\nWhen I received this computer,  I did not think it was going to meet my needs, but I had read a comprehensive review, and I thought that I would give it a try. All of the software installed easily, and there was labeling that made it easy to know what to do, and in what sequence.\n\nMuch to my surprise, I found that it loaded all software quickly and easily, and performed well.  It it generated video files well.  Okay, you need to attach a decent microphone to obtain the quality of sound that I want, but that's no big deal.  That's true with desktop systems too.\n\nI thought I was not going to be able to edit Word, PowerPoint and Excel files, but discovered that the system comes bundled with starter versions of Microsoft products so I didn't have to be concerned about that. I did upgrade to Office 365 so that I could use Microsoft Software, but I was able to use a 5 PC license plan so the total cost for several computers was relatively low.\n\nI can now install any software that I want, and the computer processor works well. The programs and web browsers respond quickly.\n\nI find that the keyboard is difficult to use for touch typist, and I had a lot of trouble balancing it on my knees (etc) without having it change from keyboard to tablet (on-line with a virtual keyboard) mode.  I wrote the manufacturer, and they send me a replacement keyboard and told me to keep the old one.  They sent the keyboard immediately.  Impressive. I also notice that it runs warm, and that if I put it in its case and immediately stick it in a computer backpack, some condensation appears on the screen sometimes, but his burns away.\n\nIf you're a hunt-and-peck typist, then the keyboard that comes with the computer is fine, but if you're a proficient touch typist, you might want to consider using a blue-tooth keyboard.  This is what I settled on.  It works well:\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Nulaxy-KM04-Dual-Device-Multi-OS-Bluetooth-Keyboard-with-Touchpad-Dock-Cradle-for-All-Tablets-and-Smartphones/dp/B016WDICQC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Nulaxy KM04 Dual Device Multi-OS Bluetooth Keyboard with Touchpad Dock Cradle for All Tablets and Smartphones</a>\n\nI took the money that I saved on this machine compared to a Microsoft Surface Pro and also bought an HP machine with a video card that has 4 gigs of RAM.  I do my work in the cloud, which lets me move from machine to machine easily.\n\nThis IRULU computer comes with Windows 10 and it uploads files to the cloud easily. I get over four (4) hours on a battery charge, which is fine for my use. It recharges in a reasonable period of time. The back does get warm when it recharges. I can't get over how good of a buy it is, and how much I enjoy using it with the blue booth keyboard.  It's a perfect size for me on an airplane--when someone pushes their seat back, I don't worry about their breaking my screen.\n\nI love the support that comes with the computer.  I love everything about it except for the keyboard (and I have workaround) and a little thing. I don't particularly care for the orange trim--but I do admit that it makes the notepad more visible, so I'm less likely to leave it behind.\n\nI have recommended this computer to at least five people, and now I'm taking the time to write this review in the hope that it will help you to make a decision to try out the IRULU. Feel free to ask me questions.  I don't work for them. I'm just trying to reward a company that provides good service and value priced product that I enjoy using."}

It was exactly what I wanted; it was light, compact, easy to use, easier to sync to my multiple devices. It was restrictive on my customization options like most post 2000 devices, and a bit over simplified. The problems started about two months in, it stopped turning on. I would randomly completely unresponsive, either by the power button or touching the screen from sleep mode. Then I noticed that it also had a problem staying in sleep mode with the keyboard case attached. All things I can work around. What really killed me is when I noticed it was developing a bubble under the screen that would be completely unresponsive, and the keyboard stopped connecting. In fact all Bluetooth or USB devices suddenly became unable to connect.\n\nI'm pretty kind to my devices, and my use of this device was always strictly on the go email, paper edits, lecture notes, web surfing and journal article reading. When it was working well I was using it maybe two to three hours a day.

This last has happened three times, and each time I've just reinstalled Windows since nothing seems to work. It will turn on, make it less than a minute, then shut off, and it will try to repair itself, then loop. When it does work it's nice, though typing any length of text on it is a nuisance (the mouse pad is over sensitive, and brushing it slightly will move the cursor; this can probably be fixed in settings but why bother when I have to reinstall Windows every so often?). The most I use it for now is to take to one class to view the powerpoint while I take notes on paper, and for eBooks.

Apart from that though I think this thing rocks, as I am writing this review with it. For the price you really cant beat it. Oh and one more thing, I'm a devout Apple user. I think there is something to be said there since this thing is twice the size of my iPad and, has double the memory, was only 175$, and so far, I love it! If anything changes I'll keep you posted.\n\nUpdate... I still love this machine, but like I said the mouse pad stinks, infact the mouse pad sucks. It REALLY sucks. I cant stress enough, get a separate mouse, the mouse pad is completely unuseable. It might as well have not have come with one, that's how crappy it is. The keyboard is good though."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "What can I say, this thing is amazing for the price!\nI am not going to say anything about Windows 10 or any of the other software on it.  I like Win 10 but the review is about the device itself, not the software.\nThis Hybrid is really quite nice.  Due to the price, I was expecting something that would have that \"cheapo\" feel to it.  To the contrary, it feels solid and well made.  The screen has plenty of brightness and great color reproduction.  It is as responsive as I would expect for a device with the hardware that this has.  Is it super fast? No. Is it pretty quick? Yes.  I am a little disappointed that they could not put a bigger SSD in it from the factory.  The uSD slot allows you to essentially put another 128GB drive in. The RAM on the other hand is already maxed out when it comes to what the CPU is able to address.  Don't think you are going to upgrade it to 16GB of RAM.  It will not work (according to Intel).\nThe cover and keyboard are a great feature of this hybrid.  The keyboard is a little small but this is of course to be expected on a 10.1\" device.  The magnets in the cover hold it closed or in \"laptop position\" well.  Only time will tell how long the flexible joints hold up.\nIn my opinion, the battery life is good.  Battery life is very subjective and relies heavily on how you use your device.  Everyone is going to have different results based on OS, screen brightness, WiFi use, Bluetooth use, USB usage, speaker volume, background applications, etc, etc.  Of course the manufacturer is going to list a really high number but no one is likely to ever see that in the real world.  None the less, in my experience I would say the batter life is good.\n\nLong story short, If you are on the fence about getting one, jump off the fence and get one!  I probably will be getting another."}

At under 200 I love her enough to buy her one. It would be nice if it supported cell but at the price what can I ask tethers to my cell phone OK so that's not a big problem. also it would be a good thing if it supported a standard USB charger.

Screen quality for internet was fine.  I do not game and wanted this as a light option for carrying around to do work on the road.  This plan did not work out because the easel design is basically for a flat surface and not on your lap.  I do think the design of the cover is very clever!  The keyboard was small.  I didn't have the opportunity to really work with it, since I could not get into the word processing 365 app because I could not login.  I don't know if that's a Windows problem or a tablet problem.  I returned the tablet.  I wish it would have worked out.  Also, the site listed the weight as 1.3 lbs, but it is really 2.4-- no big deal for most people, but I have physical issues and would really benefit from the lightest possible option.

The Ethernet card on the other hand is either low-quality hardware that was supplied by Realtek, or I ran into a bad batch.\n\nOn the other hand, many Microsoft Windows 10 users have run into a WiFi bug when transferring from Windows 8.1.  I reassure those that are reading this that I have tried every method available.  The defect in my tablet is a singular hardware issue.  The Ethernet card is receiving zero power.  How do I know this? Power management is not even available for the Ethernet card in the Control Panel.  After having right-clicked the WiFi adapter, clicking on properties, and choosing \"Configure,\" I found that the Power Management option was not available.  That either indicates a hardware failure or something beyond my knowledge of computer hardware and software.\n\nWith sincerity, I have tried everything I could based on what is available out there.  Before writing this review, I was troubleshooting this tablet for two nights.  Before that, I have been troubleshooting for weeks, looking for answers nearly every day, hoping I could fix this tablet.  It is a very good tablet if it were reliable.\n\nAt one point during the ownership of this tablet, I was able to use WiFi for a few weeks before it did decide to stop working.  I am giving it two stars due to the fact that it offers amazing value with the performance of higher end tablets in the market.  If it were a reliable tablet, I would have recommended to people in my circle.\n\nHopefully, iRULU will work with me to get it up and running again.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "Neat little tablet but after a few weeks of using it. I ran into so many random problems and decide it was not worth keeping. First I used it to edit program. I write codes in HTML, Javascript, PHP and C#. It should never be this hard just type in codes. I travel a lot and carrying a laptop is not always a good idea. I figured carry a low cost tablet. Using it to update my coding through the cloud and with a simple text editor will do the trick. I was wrong as this device was not able to preform even the simplest function like typing. It would at time preform random mouse click all over the screen. I though I could be accidentally hitting the touch pad. NOPE, I barely touch it and it would preform a mouse click. I figure I could get a mouse and turn off the touch pad. NOPE wrong again, the mouse would stop working at random so I blame the mouse at first and replace it. NOPE, it was the bluetooth as the second mouse had the same issue. Then wireless connection would stop working at times causing me to lose my work as I was using the cloud. I once again did not blame the tablet and blame my phone's hotspot. Another mistake, I connected to my home network and it does the same things. I wanted so badly to believe in this tablet. I give it one more day to prove to me that it could do the most simplest of task and allow me to type. Unfortunately, it fail and I no longer require it's service. I was surprised by high review and always wonder if I just got a bad device. Nevertheless I was so unhappy with this product and I was not going to allow it to take anymore of my time.\n\nFor those who use it play mobile game, it a good device as I was able to play my mobile game on it without much issues. I was not able to watch much online movies but using a memory card was able to play a movie I download from another computer. So best wishes to everyone else planning to buy this item. Think about what you're planning to use it for and hope this item would want to work for you.\n\nI almost forgot to include this. I brought everything I could for this tablet.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "I was greatly surprised at the build quality of this device.  I expected it to be a bit sub par for the price but was pleasantly surprised to find that I could actually compare it well against my Surface 3 in many respects.  Performance is very good, I can run office apps on it well enough, the screen is bright and viewable, and the touchscreen is very responsive.  I was very surprised to find after loading the Windows 10 Minecraft beta on it that it was very playable!  Good enough for taking with me when I travel.  So far the battery has lasted about 5-6 hours of surfing, using Groove, and doing some document editing.\n\nThe wrap around cover of the device works quite well as a stand as long as you are at a table or can place it on something solid, otherwise, just pull it off the cover and use it as a tablet.  The keyboard is a bit cramped but works well for the price - so no complaints there.  The touch pad also works as expected.\n\nFor the price - the iRULU hit it out of the park!"}

One came with 8.1 another with W10. For 8->10 upgrade you will need external SSHD, memory card or something similar.\n\nCame already with protective screen (anti-scratch) cover - so the extras I bought were not necessary.\nDid not have a chance to run exhaustive battery test, but seems to be OK for 5-9 hours, depending on what you are doing (all radios on).\nDesign is OK, with exception of the power button . Sometimes you need to hold it 5-10 sec for it to wake up.\n\nI hope this company stays around, and I hope the Walknbook lasts at least 2 years - kids love it.\nRecommended!"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "This 2-in-1 is both better than I expected and not quite as good as I expected, in different ways.\n\nI'd played around with my husband's Windows 8 devices before and frankly hated them, but this device got such good reviews that I figured, if anything, it would at least be good to use for homework. It took a little getting used to for something that I expected to be a tablet-with-a-keyboard to actually be more of a tiny Windows computer, and after I upgraded (immediately) to Windows 10, I absolutely love it.\n\nThe only problem is that I expected it to be more like my husband's HP X2, and my former RCA Voyager (which I also hated) in the way it was built. On those, the tablet component attaches directly to the keyboard, so that it's more like a laptop that you can close, and can tilt to adjust the angle of the screen. The Walknbook is not like that; it is a tablet, which happens to come with a case that happens to have a keyboard in it. The tablet attaches into the case rather than the keyboard itself, and has a bit of somewhat flimsy case between the two of them. The tablet stands up with the keyboard, when you fold the case back into a kickstand, and prop it up. This is completely impractical for using on your lap on the couch, though. I have to balance it *just right* with the device at a bit of an angle, and the kickstand propped on my thigh, and then I have to sit very still; or, I've put a cutting board on my lap as a \"table\" before, and that's worked. I'll probably get a laptop table for it at some point to avoid this issue. But it's *just* aggravating enough, as is not being able to adjust the angle of the screen because of this.\n\nI don't mind the keyboard being smaller. It took a little getting used to the feel of it, but it's fine. Only a small annoyance with where my right pinky feels like the Shift key should be, is actually the Up arrow, with the Shift key being somewhat smaller off to the right. Not a huge deal, I just have to watch for accidentally going up a line when typing when I think I'm going to capitalize something.\n\nThe touchscreen is super responsive, and I've had no problems running several things at once -- several Chrome tabs, Word, Excel, Adobe, and the software required for my Stats class, and it didn't slow down on me at all like some of the other reviews I've seen. I love being able to put basically a tiny computer in my purse, too. It does *everything* a regular computer would do, as opposed to trying to make a tablet do computer-like things (which is what happened when I tried to do homework on my old RCA)."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "I have had this tablet for about a week at this point, and so far, I am beyond impressed.  A little background - I am an I.T. professional, and I work with Microsoft Windows desktops, servers, laptops and tablets all day every day.  I am responsible for several Microsoft Surface 3 and Pro tablets.  I was looking for a Windows 10 tablet for personal use, but I am not interested in paying the $1000 and up that the Surface products cost.\n\nThe Surface is an excellent tablet, and it is the benchmark that is my reference as I evaluate this iRULU tablet.  I will start by saying that the iRULU WalkNBook is NOT a Surface.  The Surface is better.  That said, the Surface is NOT $800 better.  The iRULU WalkNBook is, simply, a fantastic product value.\n\nThe iRULU impressed from the very first, as it comes beautifully and carefully packaged.  The unit itself has a nice, solid feel and heft, while still feeling light.  There is a shipping protector on the screen, and below that is another screen protector that should be left in place.  I have not seen any actual specs, but I doubt that the iRULU has Gorilla Glass.  It may not even be glass at all.  However, the touch screen is beautifully responsive - much better than my Acer tablet.  Resolution falls short of the Surface, but the screen is very crisp.\n\nI was concerned about how the iRULU would perform, since it has the BayTrail processor and only 2GB of RAM, and I am accustomed to the Surface, with an i5 and 4GB RAM.  I don't know that I would try rendering the next Pixar movie on it, but for viewing pictures, web content and streaming video, it works fantastic.  It boots in seconds, and apps load quickly.  The unit has only 32GB of storage, which is pretty minimal for a Windows 10 tablet.  So, I added an SD card, and set that to be the location for file storage and app installs.  Performance far exceeds my expectations.\n\nLast night I used it for a 2-hour Skype session with my daughter, while I coached her through overhauling her sewing machine.  I needed to show her clear details of numerous small parts and mechanisms.  It worked beautifully, and the sound and video were both clear.\n\nI tried connecting it to my TV using the mini-HDMI port, and it immediately synced up and worked perfectly.  It also connected readily to my WiFi, and the connection has been solid.  I have installed a number of apps, and have not had any issues.\n\nWhat do I not like?  So far, it is a short list.  It does not charge through the micro-USB port, and depends on having its own wall charger.  So, my options for keeping it charged are more limited.  Second, the touchpad on the included keyboard is a little wonky - for the first day or so, it was jumping all over the place, until I figured out how to work it smoothly.  The Surface keyboard is far superior.\n\nSo, in summary, if you are looking for a great value in a tablet, and don't require the absolute best, this is an unbeatable value.  If you are hard on your stuff, I can't vouch for how it will hold up.  But, so far, I am sold.  It is a keeper!"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "So I am gonna write the most honest review I possibly can. Fear not though, it's basically all good!\n\nLet's start from the beginning, I bought the walknbook in May of 2015 for college purposes as I wanted something that had the option to be a laptop but also the abilities of a tablet without breaking the bank and it has been a saving grace! I got the free year of Microsoft 360 and when you have endless essays to write this works well. To add upon that having the option to save anything into the 32gb one drive was also a big help, again, lots of assignments I needed to save for school. Hookup to networks and printers was easy after a little practice as was personalizing it. User friendly too.\n\nThe green color is right between a lime and seafoam green, not quite what is pictured but still darn close and I almost like the actual color more. Screen is a perfect size and being able to do two screens side by side at once helped with many of research projects. Really I cant say enough good things about this tablet.\n\nHowever I do have one con which is what brought this review down to 4 stars, that being the keyboard sometimes had issues registering with the tablet (I will explain this issue later) and the stand is a little on the flimsy side due to it being only magnets. This can be bypassed by just not scooting the computer toward you and making the flaps fold out from behind! Easy enough. Besides when you actually visit irulu's website they have several options for buying a different keyboard case combo to fit your needs but at an extra price.\n\nNow I also want to give a big thumbs up to the company, I had managed to somehow snag myself a problem child that developed over several months, where the tablet wouldn't register the keyboard, being stubborn I thought nothing of it and this eventually lead into it taking longer for the walknbook to turn on before it suddenly quit turning on all together for me. (if you start having issues contact the company immediately and they will do everything they can to help you!). I was out of the free replacement 90 day warranty when my tablet suddenly stopped working on me just a few weeks ago. However the company listened to all that had occurred and worked something out with me so I could continue to enjoy this product as I continue college.\n\nI would recommend this product from the seller as they have excellent customer service and it's just a great buy for those unfamiliar with the new windows style as it gives the traditional desktop option and is pretty easy to figure out after you get your hands on it. Just remember irulu has nice people willing to answer any of your questions as soon as they pop up and they have lots of fun accessories on their actual website.\n\nHope this answers anyone's worries they may have had!"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "I've used a variety of iOS and Android tablets over the years, and wanted to try my hands on something in the tablet form factor that actually runs Windows. I wasn't looking to spend the full price of a Surface tablet, so I looked around, found this during a sale, and gave it a shot.\n\nThe Good: Upgrades to Windows 10, accepts high-end microSD cards for additional storage, comes with a year of Office and extra Onedrive storage (like many Windows devices), comes with a keyboard/touchpad dock, accepts most any Windows device you could plug into a USB drive. I was even able to run Rocket League on its lowest settings. If you use it as a media-consumption and Internet device (as most tablets are used), this gets the job done fine. Screen was very nice looking and, while it needed a touch calibration, was quite accurate once I'd done so.\n\nThe Bad: It turns out that I wanted to run it like my desktop: a dozen or more websites open in tabs, etc. Android and iOS devices handle this fine by nicely swapping things in and out as they're not used. Windows doesn't, causing me to get major slowdown and constant low-memory errors. To be clear, this is an issue with how I use this device; it's not what it's made for. Just be aware this is a low-memory Windows setup and act accordingly.\n\nThe included case and keyboard are minimalist; they get the job done, but that's about it. The display stand works by folding part of the cover into a pyramid shape. This makes it impractical to use, say, on a couch, as the case is coming to a point right between your legs and thus falling between them. The touchpad includes no way to disable it, and the keyboard is small enough that your hands will brush it as you type, causing it to move and click randomly. My last laptop had palm detection features in its touchpad software but I couldn't find any here.\n\nThis isn't a device you can leave unplugged in sleep mode for a couple days; you'll want to charge it when you can. The AC adapter is a round plug that unfortunately also nearly fits in the audio jack port that's located on the same side of the machine, in the opposite position as the AC port, so if you have the device flipped (say, it's in its case) you might put it in the wrong place. I was told the machine could charge via the small USB port, but this was not the case (and I honestly don't know what that port is for as a result). I left the AC adapter behind once and was unable to use my tablet until it was returned to me, since it's not a universal port like MicroUSB.\n\nWant to blow away the SSD and install a clean copy of Win10? It doesn't work, because it won't find any of its drivers and they're not available online. You're then stuck downloading a hard-to-find 4GB system restore file from an off-shore, agonizingly-slow server in order to slowly reinstall Win8 then reinstall Win10 back on top of that.\n\nThe Ugly: I bought this mid-August, and by January it had developed a stress-fracture crack clear across the back panel. It wasn't dropped or anything; it started where I held it (vertically with one giant man-hand) and quickly went across the entire length. The back panel is a remarkably thin piece of plastic, unfortunately, and the crack goes clear through. It's left me paranoid to use the device since its internal components are at risk of exposure if the crack gets any worse.\n\nThat said, iRULU says they offer a one-year no-questions return for users willing to provide a review. Hence, why I'm here. I'll update on my situation (and my overall opinion of my experience) when they respond. For now, assuming I can return it, I enjoyed my time with it but it isn't quite fitting my needs. I may be returning a a mid-grade Android device."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "I gave this 4 Stars for a couple of reasons.  First, my initial purchase, about 2 weeks earlier, had to be returned, when the iRULU had a fatal error (a BDOS errror, where there was an incessant high-pitched error, with no relief.  The message box said to contact Microsoft at [their phone#] but they denied any responsibility for a non-MS device.  I sent an email to iRULU, but never received a response..  So I returned the iRULU to Amazon within 3 days, and they did Credit my CC.  And I did immediately Re-Order the same Walknbook.  Thankfully, it was exactly as advertised, and I am now still using it about a month later.\n\nThis Win10 device is OK.  The battery life is fairly short; more short than I'd like.  But it does have all of the Win10 features.\n\nFor another perspective, I also started using a Nexus 9 at the same time.  [Note:  Both of these are my first Tablets, ever !]\nI am finding the Android system more accomodating than Win10.  And the Apps for the Nexus are actually better.  Both of these devices are available to me at any time, and I find that I more regularly power up the Nexus.\n\nIn fairness, the iRULU is less than half the cost, so I do consider it a very good value.  AND, on the Win10-plus side, there are certain 3rd-party software programs, that do not run on Android, but they do run on Windows.  I will continue to power up both devices."}

I will never buy a tablet with Windows on it again.  Why they can't build a separate OS for tablets is beyond me.  My little dog has more common sense than the person who deciding sticking a full blown OS on a little 2 gb tablet would be a good idea.\nIf this tablet had Android, it would probably be pretty solid."}

It froze and windows 10 tried to do a repair....which failed. I was not able to boot the device into Windows 10 after this.\nTo resolve, upon boot i hit the escape key, went into Bios, and set my boot order to Boot from a Windows 10 Home Flash drive that i already had created.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "If you want a pure Windows tablet, the iRulu Walknbook 10.1\" strikes me as a solid 3.5 out of 5 stars (it might have been a \"4\", but mine seemed to have some shake on the tracking function; I am not sure whether it was a flaw the one I got specifically, or with the design overall).  As a mini laptop, however, it is more of a 3 out of 5 star product, largely due to the substantial challenge of using the keyboard for anything but quick and basic functions.\n\nI should add that my spouse bought this unit (however, in gray, not in orange), with our own money; we did not receive the product for free like so many of the other reviewers seemed to.  After a week of intensive use with it, returned it in favor of an 11.6 unit from another company (see below), since we needed one with a comfortable keyboard and more reliable mouse tracking.\n\n**** SOLID AS A TABLET ****\n\nIf one were to want a low cost Windows 10 tablet (rather than a small laptop substitute), this might fit the bill.  Windows 10 is a vast improvement over 8.1, so seeking out 10 is a worthwhile enterprise; however, as of early 2016, there are very few tablets with Windows 10 available.  This is a newer, slightly better processor than most of the other lower-end Windows 10 tablet offerings.\nI found the touch responsiveness to be so-so (sometimes worked well enough, but sometimes frustratingly imprecise.)  The touch precision seemed \"choppy\" at times relative to my iPad, which has always had smooth operation.\n\nThe Walknbook is small and lean (it is crazy heavy inch-per-inch, but there aren't many inches so it is still impressively lightweight!)  It can be tossed into a bag, nearly into a purse, and it feels solid.\n\nSet up with quick and straightforward (however, as with all Windows 10 machines, if you care much about privacy, be sure to do an online search for the settings you need to toggle during set up; the options are tricky for this version.)\n\nAs a pure tablet for under $200, this machine is worth considering (although be forewarned that it is possible that you may find the touch precision of the tablet to be unpredictably imprecise.)\n\n**** FAIRLY POOR AS A TRAVEL LAPTOP ****\n\nWhat I really needed was a small, lightweight, inexpensive laptop.  My ambitions for what it needed to do in terms of power were modest (Microsoft Office 365, web, and e-readers, mostly).  It mostly needed to be small, with a keyboard that would make for a reasonable, if not perfect, typing experience.\n\nIn practice, though, the keyboard on the iRulu is just way too small to be viable for more than a couple of minutes.  It is like a little carpal tunnel machine!  There is nothing inherently bad about this keyboard in particular vs. the competition for other 10\" laptops; however, I came away from it realizing that a screen size that small simply cannot allow for a reasonable keyboard.\n\nInstead, I returned this machine, and bought an 11.6\" HP Pavilion x360 instead.  It boasts a keyboard that is far more realistic; still not full sized, but viable for an hour or two of typing without pain and the kinds of endless mistakes I kept making on the teeny iRulu keyboard.\n\nIn making that change, I added about .6 lb of weight, and a little bulk in every direction, which are real downsides.\n\nOn the HP, the tablet doesn't pop off; as it does on the iRulu.  Instead, the HP does a full \"4-way\" flip around.  I prefer that, because I will usually be using it with the keyboard, and because I don't fully trust the pogo type connector between the keyboard and screen on the iRulu.  The HP also has a better processor (a Pentium 3700).\n\nWe got the HP on a fairly amazing Black Friday deal for $240, but it would normally be about 2x as expensive as the iRulu, which is a considerable difference.  I did not find any other 11.6\" machines that were worth considering; the others on the lower end had poor reviews with much weaker processors.  So it is a big jump up between an 10\" machine like the iRulu, and an 11.6\"+ machine like the HP Paviilion; it really depends on how important typing is to you, and whether the inconvenience of attaching an external keyboard would be too much.\n\n**** BOTTOM LINE ****\n\nIn short, the 11.6\" machine I ended up with feels like a smallish laptop, that can also be flipped over into a tablet, whereas the iRulu Walknbook feels like a tablet with a painful, imprecise keyboard I quickly realized I would never really use.\n\nAt the very least, I would highly recommend that you try a machine of each of these sizes in a store before you buy to see if they work passably well for you from an ergonomic perspective (but the trick is that the 10.1\" machines can be hard to find in stores.)"}

It is pretty zippy for only having 2GB of ram.  It does have some lag, but that was to be expected.  If you are wanting a full laptop / desktop replacement, you will be disappointed.  I use mine to make notes, surf the web, watch some youtube, and play the occasional wizard101 game.  I bought a 64GB sd card, and one or larger is essential.  With the OS installed, there is VERY little disk space to install apps.  The display quality is very impressive as the colors pop off the screen and look crisp.  If I had to pick out a few cons, one would be the very touch pad.  My palm hits it and suddenly the screen will go into duo mode.  I use a wireless mouse to take care of that issue.  The battery life is also ok, as I get about 5 h  ours of normal use on this. Have also taken it into tablet more with very little issues.  Would certainly buy another!"}

I bought this primarily to function both at work and in my university courses. Upon turning the tablet on and connecting to WiFi, I noticed that the windows update option was not functioning. This is very typical of a fraudulent key to Windows OS. The second issue with this tablet is the keyboard. It does not deserve to be called a keyboard. It is extremely flimsy, you will not be able to type with this in your lap. If you plan on using this tablet daily, I am sure the keyboard will fail, so factor in the cost of a Bluetooth keyboard into the total cost of the product. Another major issue, as other reviewers have stated, is that the tablet becomes very hot, on the side of the ports (left side) and it does begin to smell like overheated plastic. Which brings me to my final point: build quality. The outside of the tablet is a cheap-feeling dull plastic. I don't see this lasting very long. It seems like the screen is glued to this plastic making the entire unit seem shoddy. Please read through the other reviews, save your money, you earned it, and purchase something else.

I mean it don't do much of what you want a tablet to do. Just Internet I guess. And I can't say I'm much of a tech person but course I know there basdics like any one that grew up with technology. But its really confusing to set some things up... Just putting that out there. Not gonna go into detail. Also I would think this would be as tiny bit more sturdy. But the back is cracked and I swear I don't use this thing much! Ibdfont hardly ever move it so I don't know why its cracked! Only had it for about two months! Well anyway. It's cool. You just have to spend money for good quality. Since this was cheep I shoudnt expect too much. It might just bs me becuse im used to Android everything. not windows. So its okay. I still like it. Three stars. I'm generous but I think it deserves two stars."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "This is a nifty little 2-in-1 for around 200 bucks, its a good value as the majority of the posts here will tell you. Im not going to talk about that though. For various reasons, I ended up wanting to do a fresh install of Windows 8.1 and it was a heck of a ride. Ill outline my steps below in case anyone else finds himself wanting to do the same.\n\nIf you want to install Windows 8.1 and get this tablet back to how it began, first you need to download the 32-bit Windows 8.1 ISO. Although the processor says it is 64-bit compatible, I was never able to get 64-bit Windows 8.1 to install (it would give some incompatibility warning if trying to boot from Windows, or if trying to boot from BIOS it would simply skip the installation process altogether). You can Google the official Microsoft Windows 8.1 install images, which will allow you to put it on a USB flash drive. Youll probably want at least an 8 GB stick. Unfortunately, when I extracted the existing Windows CD key and tried to use it again to install 8.1 it didn't work, so I had to use another key. If you don't have a spare Windows key, ask a nerdy friend and Im sure they will be able to help you.\n\nOnce you get past that part, if all goes well it will boot up into a fresh version of Windows 8.1. However, now were left without several important drivers specific to the 2-in-1, not just a generic desktop computer. For example, the power button no longer functioned as normal, it would only do hard shutdowns. For the drivers, Google the article WalknBook IRulu w1002 Drivers [Windows Tablet/PC] by Larry Henry Jr. In it, he uploads a copy of all the drivers it came with. Download the Double Driver application as he mentions and use it to install the drivers onto your Walknbook. The next step is to go through Windows update, since you will no doubt be behind on many updates. During this step for me, it appeared to be stuck downloading updates at 0% for a long time, but simply be patient and eventually it will work, even if the progress bar doesnt appear to function. If you have problems, do a Google search for windows update stuck at 0 and perhaps something will work. What I did was stop Windows Update in the Services program, delete everything in the C:Windows\\SoftwareDistribution, restart Windows Update in Services, and then retry searching for updates. Thats what worked for me. If you have any questions let me know.\n\nIf that doesnt work, it appears another option is to flash the image from the iRulu driver download page. I didn't try it, but look for W1002 W1003 windows8.1 with bing OS. I believe thats what you would need.\n\nTags: Windows 8.1, uninstall, reinstall, clean install, fresh install, deinstall, drivers, bios, uefi"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "Awesome machine for times when a tablet comes in handy. Performance is surprisingly good for most common tasks like browsing, email, Skype, streaming movies (Netflix, Hulu etc.), editing documents and even casual gaming. The display is excellent. I highly recommend a clean install of windows 10 which will give you lots of storage back from the pre-installed multi language windows 8 image the machine came with (Hint: drivers for the machine can be downloaded from iRulu). I also added a 128 GB SD card for extra local storage. Battery life time and keyboard is not its strength, but then again what can you ask for with such a great price tag. Might want to consider adding a better Bluetooth keyboard and mouse. All in all I am very pleased and recommend this tablet as long as you don't expect it to perform like a $500+ machine. I actually bought another one for my kids and they love it."}

I love that its portable so the hassle of carrying this around is not a struggle. I originally bought this to replace my bulky and heavy laptop, and it surely has done the job. The clarity and picture are amazing and the sound quality is wonderful. The iRULU Walknbook comes equipped with Word 365, which is what I wanted, since I'm a college student. I definitely recommend this machine to any college student wanting to replace their laptop. The only downfall I see is the space on it but that can be fixed with a memory card. You can upgrade to Windows 10 if you like or keep Windows 8. One more thing about this was the price, for under $200 dollars that got me sold!!. So yes, this is what I use now instead of my old heavy laptop, plus comes with a free detachable keyboard!"}

Using the tablet in windows 10 tablet mode is an excellent user experience.  The keyboard that comes with it is just OK.  I purchased the Tabsuit Dragon Touch i10X Ultra Slim SmartShell Stand Cover from amazon for 20 bucks and it works much better.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "I got this delivered last Monday, and for the first few days, I was really happy with it.  I had read a lot of the negative reviews before buying it, but I also saw some good reviews.  For the price, it seemed worth a try.  It was at least as fast as my wife's ipad 4, and the video quality was really good.  I played videos from Netflix no problem, and the internet was fast enough.\n\nI liked having Windows on it, because I can do real work, too. I upgraded to Windows 10 without too much trouble.  A not of warning is that it requires an SD card to give addition storage for the new Windows files, but while it took a few hours, I was able to make the upgrade, and Windows 10 worked fine. Have a full size USB port and an HDMI port were also plusses.\n\nThe keyboard was a bit small for my hands (I wear a man's XL glove size), but I wasn't buying it for that.  The mouse pad on it is very convenient and works well.  And I like having the keyboard be part of the carrying case and stand.\n\nUnfortunately, on Thursday night, I pulled a USB drive out of the port and heard a pop.  The screen went blank and then stayed blank, not matter what I tried.  Even after charging overnight, it still didn't work.  So, I returned it to Amazon.  Too bad the hardware had the problem because I really liked it."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "I purchased this on November 10th, when it was still the tablet with Windows 8.1 and Office Suite-for-a-year. I also purchase this with a chip and the tempered glass screen protector (per recommendations, bought chip in case I needed more memory, and it was discounted in bulk buying with the screen protector, as those \"often bought together\" items on Amazon sometimes are).\n-----------\n(This will be long, but I want to be thorough, including all positive and negative experiences)\n\nExperience since receiving, IN TEMPORAL ORDER:\n\nWhen I took my tablet out of the box, I was obviously excited, it looked very nice.\n- two initial pros for me: after removing the throw away plastic screen protectors, I noticed both the front and back had screen protectors. This you can leave on and never purchase anything else\nto avoid scratching. Nice that it was there.\n- I removed the touch screen/front screen's screen protector to put on the tempered glass one I bought. The tempered glass screen protector did not fit well without some finessing. I gave it a 1 star review. It was very bubbled. Had to slowly peel off and place and push to manage to get least bubbling. However, I am inclined to believe the bubbling was caused by the following:\n- after tempered glass placement, I turned the tablet over to look at the back. First thought \"I should have bought a protector for the back\". While it looks nice, also means just as flimsy. I think future models have remedied this and they no longer have this. Anyway, it's fine, if you take care of it, it isn't an issue. BUT ---->>> I noticed a corner (top left) was popped out slightly, and glue threads everywhere on left side. I, dumb, thought \"whatever\" popped it back in, DONE. It was good. (MORE ON THIS LATER)\n- turned on tablet, navigated Windows 8.1 (never had used, I have 7 on my laptop), and enjoyed using the tablet for a week.\n- I definitely can say I LOVE THE TABLET, IT IS GREAT, decent audio, okay camera quality (didn't buy for cameras though), GREAT video streaming, convenient for typing notes (one of many reasons I wanted it). I am a Cartographer/GIS Analyst, and the week of November 17th was GEOweek - long story short, this tablet got a lot of use, moving around between meetings and \"conference\" type spaces, easily showing data, sharing, and more importantly, teaching people how to use some free humanitarian online mapping tools. I easily showed people because of the tablet. I also bought a stylus right before my training sessions, and I used the stylus to create data points on OpenStreetMap (what I was training people to use). Was very happy that worked. Didn't need to bring a mouse. So that experience solidified all the reasons why I bought this tablet: inexpensive, works great just like reviews say, powerful, fast, convenient. Doesn't matter that I hadn't heard of the brand. Thanks iRulu start up! I plan on buying things in the future\n\nWHEN PROBLEMS BEGAN:\nDay after this event, I took my tablet out of keyboard case (PS the keyboard is great too), and noticed the back had popped out again, glue threads too. I pushed it to pop it back in, and it CRACKED. (1) this shows how fragile the back is, so just be careful when purchasing (2) I immediately said \"DAMN IT\" because it's new!!! 6 days after receiving (3) I reminded myself immediately that the product arrived like that IF THIS KIND OF THING HAPPENS TO YOU WITH ANYTHING YOU BUY, INMEDIATELY RETURN AND REPLACE, don't be like me and think you fix it!! Lol... I promised myself I wouldn't make that mistake again, but decided it was worth reaching out to Amazon to see if I could get a replacement, since I hadn't had the tablet for very long, and it came faulty and the reason for the cracks was the faultiness of tablet\n\nAMAZON CUSTOMER SERVICE - for first time ever, I experienced terrible service. Perhaps when they are not the actual seller, they decide it's okay to treat you badly and not be helpful. Was probably just the person working, but was not okay. JOHANNA (I think it was spelled differently....) sent me on a wild goose chase and told me Amazon couldn't do anything (fine) but this apparently included communicating with the seller. And that I could not communicate with them directly through amazon's user interface... So I had to figure out on my own how to talk to iRulu...\n- IRULU's website has a chat service (great!). I wrote at 11pm, so emailed instead - got immediate response. iRulu was helpful and said they could help, but that I needed to contact the division dedicated to Amazon sales, and to let them know I talked to someone at their \"main site\" already. Gave me instructions on how to do so (in Amazon.com.... So Amazon rep was wrong)\n- I messaged iRulu via Amazon AKA iRulu's Amazon sales staff - at 6:45am. Again, got immediate communication. They called me immediately, SAME DAY, ~10am, 3 times - I missed the call (work), didn't recognize number.... But googled it, since I thought (rightly so) that iRulu may be trying to talk to me - and they were. I called back, and a lovely rep named Lynne answered and said she had been calling me and was just in the process of emailing me.\n- As I had already explained the situation in writing (and I also attached photos of the issue), she DID NOT make me reexplain what had happened (WHICH OFTEN STUPIDLY HAPPENS with this kind of stuff, so I appreciate that she didn't make me explain it again!!). I said hello and was ready to explain, but she just told me immediately that she and iRulu were VERY sorry I received a bad product, and that they would send out a replacement as soon as I sent them back the tablet - which they paid for. She emailed me a shipping label and it was done.\n- something worth noting: She also said the replacement would be a newer version, with a different keyboard, and in grey, because the kind I ordered was gone. I said this was fine, in fact, better. I also mentioned that I had bought the screen protector and it was already attached to the tablet, and if it was possible to get that sent and replaced. She said \"yes, of course. Don't try to take that off to reuse it, I'll note that down\". She did, and it was on the replacement ticket the ENTIRE TIME\n- so I sent it back (not the chip though). I got the replacement within a week. And the entire email communication process throughout was always speedy, kind, and FANTASTIC. I sent some emails asking about tracking number and clarifying stuff.\n- Reason for 4 stars instead of 5 begins here: I didn't receive the newer tablet and keyboard as Lynne promised. I assume this was miscommunication with people doing the actual shipping. I am not mad - I did get what I ordered replaced. But, as it was what was promised, I just need to point out that it wasn't what happened. It IS at least, slightly newer. What is NOW here listed at the same price (without office suite) - tablet with Windows 10, instead of Windows 8.1\n--->>> side note Windows 10 is SO much better. Far less confusing!!\nAlso... Reason for 4 stars, not 5.... The tempered glass screen protector did NOT arrive. It was listed throughout email communication as one of the TWO items needing replacement, so again, this is the fault of those shipping out the items, not Lynne's or other customer reps I communicated with (Marie, Stephon: you guys were also awesome and kind)\n- I messaged immediately and said I did not receive the tempered glass replacement. Stephon responded within a few hours (late Friday night!) to apologize, noting he saw that this happened in the shipping history upon reviewing, and promised to send me a new one ASAP. Because of how amazing customer service has been throughout, I 100% trust this is going to happen, no doubts at all. I'm writing this on Sunday, just waiting for him to respond to the email I replied to him with.\n- ONE MORE note: the Windows 10 replacement tablet I got did NOT come with the Office Suite......... I did ask on the phone if my replacement tablet would have ALL THE SPECS that I ordered initially (and I said \"office suite, 32 GB, etc), and Lynne assured me this was the case. I can only assume the one she promised me actually did have all the same software and hardware specs, but unfortunately, due to whoever ultimately packaged the shipment..... Not the case.....\n\n- SO, 5/5 customer service, 5/5 product, but 4/5 because of the people shipping the replacements.\n\nAnd again: loving the tablet, even more so now with Windows 10. Note: the Windows 8 one, all comments recommended not to upgrade to Windows 10, said it caused some issues. So if you want Windows 10, I recommend purchasing with it installed. If you don't care, I believe there are still some other options on sale on Amazon (an orange one, I saw today for example) that still include the office suite for a year. Either way - the tablet is awesome.\n\noverall I recommend, as I said: fantastic tablet, and great customer service. JUST REMEMBER, if you require a replacement, to really really emphasize to customer service to make sure that you are getting the shipment they promised. I know they will listen and make sure that is the case, as my follow ups with Stephon for the tempered glass that was missing show that the customer service cares A LOT that you get what you are supposed to"}

Youll find the 10.1 inch IRULU tablet, user manual, OTG cable, micro USB cord and wall power cable- AC charger (there is HDMI output but microHDMI cable is not included). So IRULU X1 comes with an octa core processor, 1GB DDR3 RAM, 16GB storage that can be expanded with a microSD card, Android 4.4.4 KitKat operating system which is their own version of Android and you will get the wireless updates from them and this is not a common feature to other no-brand or unfamiliar Android devices.\nGlass 10.1 inch S-IPS (next generation Super IPS with enhanced pixel refreshing) high definition display with 1024 x 600 pixel resolution display with 160 degree viewing angles- a little less than perfect viewing angles of the 178 degree IPS display but crisp and sharp images if viewed straight on, game performance with Android games is quite good- youll play them easily and you won't really notice any lags. Photos and movies look great, you just have to keep it at the right angle and this screen is probably not for two or more people to watch videos together. It has dual 2 megapixel cameras but they are all right and work fine for video chatting or taking still photos. Sound quality through the single speaker is not amazing but quite OK for listening to music or watching movies (on par with other low cost tablets) and you will be better off using a Bluetooth speaker or headphones. It weighs 1.8 pounds and measures 10.16 x 0.35 x 5.89 inches, is very nice to look at with narrow bezel technology (space saving and great visuals).

The primary pull for it was its battery life, which the iRULU has at least equalled.\n\nSo, that aside, let's talk about the uses of it. I'm a student in college, and for me the key is portability and battery life. Both of which might be this device's strong suits. It lasts about 9 hours and weighs about 2 pounds. It's easy to detach from its keyboard and carry around seperately, but usually I prefer not to. Here's the no-shit pros and cons:\n\nPros: Lightweight, easy to carry around.\nLong battery life\nBright screen, responsive\nComes with windows 8 for free. Nice because that would normally add a lot to the price\nCase securely shuts and opens\nand of course the price. I've had peoples' jaws drop when I told them it was only $200, compared with the surface pros it's based on which normally cost 3-4 times as much.\n\nThat being said, it's time for cons.\nThe main issue with it is the case is the most convenient. While I'm sure there are other cases to buy, I've not found any. The case only has one setting for the resting angle, and I found myself constantly struggling with it. It's impossible to use without some kind of hard surface under it (in laptop mode). If you're not careful it'll detach and collapse.\nThe memory is limited to 32 gb, 10 of which are already taken by the OS. This can be upgraded with a card but as I use mine for text editing, there's no need.\nIt's software suite is unfortunately small.\n\nThe lowdown: Definitely worth your money.  If you need a tablet or a laptop, this is definitely the way to go. Could use a new case and some more memory, but neither of those detract enough to make me change my opinion on it."}

The design! It looks slick, especially with the orange edges.\n\n2. The keyboard that came with the device isn't just some cheap throwaway. It's actually very comfortable to use and doesn't feel tacky like some of the ones I've bought for other tablets beforeit is *made* for this product, and that says a lot about the company.\n\n3. The overall features exceeded my expectations for a product in this price range. It updates to Windows 10.1 and comes with a year of office. The sound is great, the display is clear and the screen comes pre-covered with a glass screen protector, and the attention to the boxing made the unboxing experience an artful experience for me!\n\nAs much as I love this device, it's not perfect:\n1. It's a little heavy to hold for longer than a few minutes. The keyboard case that comes with this device, although of high quality, does not prop up on even or soft surfaces. Thankfully, iRULU sells a mounted case for this device for cheap and I can now comfortably use this device on my lap.\n\n2. The battery drains a little faster than other tablets I have used (i.e., iPad, Samsung Galaxy Tab). Then again, I'm not emptying my wallet for this device.\n\n3. The tablet also gets a little warm when I watch one too many Asian dramas in a row, but it doesn't get hot or overheatit's overlook-able.\n\n3. Granted this isn't an iRULU Walk'n'book issue, the Windows store is very limited compared to the AppStore or the Play store. For example, there's no Chrome app and the links and tabs in the desktop version is difficult to click.\n\nAll in all, if you're planning to use this tablet for games or in tablet mode, I would consider getting an iPad or an Android tablet instead. However, if you're like me and you're looking for a substitute for the Surface Pro that can run Windows programs, then this device is a steal!

I bought this as my main Asus laptop had taken a devastating tumble off of my lofted bed (RIP)\nAs a college student I figured this little guy would be great to carry about.  The price is very cheap affordable as well so I gave it a shot. Like you I read the reveiws first.  I was impressed with the top comment (The full video) and alot of other folks had great things to say as well. Then of course I clicked on the 1 and 2 star ratings and leaned the horrors of the device never turning back on, updating for hours on end, shutting down forever after 62 days...etc. I just hoped my usual luck would play out.\n\nI started setting it up the day it came in. It felt great! The tablet magnetized right on to the keyboard and everything connected smoothly. I went through the initial set up and finally got to my new home screen. I wanted to add Netflix right away and realized I couldn't open the app store.  The loading screen spun and spun for about 20 mins before I gave up. A few other apps wouldn't open either! I tired to update it and it completely froze over.  I was so worries I would be sending it back. I then did a full factory reset which didn't really take so long at all ....and bam! It's been perfect ever since. Maybe that's all it takes?\n\nI will update my review as the weeks go by."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "I must say that this is one of the most reasonably priced tablets out there, but you get what you pay for. I noticed some issues right away but they were small things like having to tap something a few times in order for it to actually become selected and if I left it on for more than a day it would do little things like refuse to turn the screen off. I thought they were no big deal since it's a cheap tablet and there are bound to be a few quirky things here and there. The problems became really apparent about two months after my purchase. It has become a much more frequent ordeal trying to get the tablet to just select something, it now had a noticeable lag in carrying out any task. Now there's a whole host of intermittent glitches on a regular basis, such as not recognizing touch at all, forcing me to do a hard shut down, or reading a few invisible fingers on the screen constantly touching it (there are little grey areas that show when you''re touching it, phantom fingers are occasionally hanging out in the top left corner of my screen). Sometimes I'll tap and it shows two points of contact like I'm using two fingers. There's more, but I'll save you all the details. Long story short, I was unhappy. I contacted iRulu in hopes that they might replace the defective item...no such luck. BIG HEADS UP, you only get a 90 day warranty. I contacted them a little after this 90 day period cause, well, I'm in school and didn't have time to send in my digital notebook for repairs in the middle of classes. Big mistake. They told me they couldn't do anything for me since it was out of the 90 day warranty, but they would replace/repair it for 50% of the item's value. No thanks. I gave it two stars because it is a really low priced tablet, which is nice, and when it's not flipping out it is quite handy to have around. So my advice is to either get a different tablet or make sure you get the warranty just in case it craps out on you outside of the three months they'll actually stand by their product."}

I bought this tablet for school to run some basic programs like Microsoft office, Matlab, and Multisim. At first this tablet worked great and I basically used it as my laptop whenever I was away from home, I was able to use a microSD and mask it as an actual mounted drive to use with Onedrive and Dropbox. Unfortunately this only lasted about 2 months, now the tablet is very unstable. Not exactly why this started to happen but now it is constantly turning off when not connected to a power supply. I have had a few moments where it will stay on for a short periods of time without the power supply connected but this does not last very long.

After having success with Apple products I felt reluctant to go back to windows, but the the ipads rediculous pricing and lack of freedom with memory add-ons forced me to give other tablets a serious look. I'm glad I did. The Walknbook comes with a case and attachable keyboard which connects easily and works instantly. Although many are making the move to Windows 10, i love Windows 8 as it allows for both an app screen (like an ipad or iphone) and a raw windows desktop experience. The Walknbook's buttons are all well placed and well-made. The screen is clear and sharp. The touch screen works as well as anything i've used and even supports a stylus. It allows for the use of SD cards (I'm using a 128gig card), usb connection, and even an hdmi out?! Unbelievable features for the price!"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "Thoughts: First and foremost I feel like this should be a tablet, so I ran the device through what most tablets do for most of their life. I fired up Chrome, and streamed some music from SoundCloud while surfing the web. Immediately issues appeared when websites would take between five and ten seconds to load. Bringing up the task manager shows that the CPU is at 80% just running Chrome.\nWe all know Chrome is a pig, so I removed it and installed FireFox. Same result. The same pages took between five and ten seconds to load and the system lagged heavily with 80% CPU utilization. Music did not, however chop in either browser.\nKilled the music and web surfing became better, but it was never what you would call fluid. For office products, it can easily handle Outlook or Word. I connected a USB keyboard for typing as the keyboard attached to the cover is useless to me (I'm only 5'7\" tall weighing in at 160lbs). My wife had the same complaint, with the keyboard.\nHowever if you switch to Excel or PowerPoint the system begins lagging again. Anything even remotely calculation intense (one spreadsheet with some simple math) causes noticeable strain on the CPU.\n\nPros: With a Quad core CPU, 32gb of SSD space and a built in card reader that supports up to a 128gb micro SD this small and light tablet is just the right thing for when you need to do more then play games or brose the net while on the go.\n\nCons: The keyboard, I just cannot overlook how annoying it can be. It is enough to get a few things done on the go, but for more serious work I suggest you invest in a cheap Bluetooth keyboard.\n\nOther Thoughts: From the moment I opened the box I couldn't help wonder if I could upgrade to windows 10 and what kind of issues I might run into. I was pleasantly surprised that a free upgrade to windows 10 was very easy, the only additional thing I needed was a USB drive with at least 10GB on it because the internal storage was not enough for the rollback files.\n\nHDMI, mini usb, full size usb, and microSD slot. Better connectivity than Dell or Lenovo.\n\n I will not take off any stars for this.\nThere are a few other misses. The touch screen works great, but it is the worst for showing smudges and fingerprints. Irulus web support is not that great. It is hard to find what you are looking for because it is just a long table with serial numbers. Most websites let you work through context menus to get to the right stuff. The charger block and battery get very hot on charging. You should keep that in mind when you charge the device. It should not be on its back and there should be some air around the block and the back."}

It was packaged ok and had a foam protector around it in the form fit box, I liked that. In 3 days I have loaded a bunch of my old apps on it and they have all worked very well. The screen is pretty good although a bit \" pixelie \" for the lack of a better term. The viewing angle is better than some people say BUT you NEED to rest your eyes after 30 min or so. I do have to say the wireless connection is far better than the x1s. It does not have the FM chip activated OR GPS, which is kind of a bummer for me, because I love to listen to the radio on long trips. Still, the lack of a dedicated charging port makes it kind of hard to watch my movies on an external hhd. I still have not found an otg charging/usb adapter that works with Irulu, I may have to just build one, if I can find the specs I need. The tablet still feels kind of flimsy and a screen protector is a must. The digitizer is soft and if you touch it with your fingernail it WILL scratch. I like the TF slot on the side of the tablet instead of the button and connector end, makes it easier for me to get to.\n The android system can not be updated to 5.1 which is both good and bad but having the option would be nice. Bare bones installed apps so not much bloatware still the Irulu market is, well, yah........I tried to install a document app that I use with my Galaxy s5, No good. Laggy and app stopes responding so I am going to just find a small office app, still looking for one that will do all the docs i use.\n I am glad all of the learning apps I have for my daughter all function very good.

I was on the verge of creating a support stand for the device with cardboard and duct tape when a friend pointed out that the top cover of the wrap around sleeve may be the prop. Sure enough, soon as I bent the straight cover a little it collapsed into a neat magnetic connecting folded stand for the tablet. This version does not have enough space to install Windows 10 which is a shame. If I had to buy again I'd have gone with the 64gb version. The power source is a power cord rather than the usual USB cord with plugin many current phones and devices are using. For me it means one more plug I have to pack in my gear when I go anywhere."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "Fantastic tablet that seems very snappy for the price. I do like the way the case folds back to make a stand and the screen looks great on this machine. I would agree like most every other review that the tablet gets warm when charging which has developed into an issue for me.  The top right back of the tablet (when looking at the screen) appears to be coming unglued from the actual tablet. I noticed this the other day and it clearly is coming apart from the rest of the tablet. I can actually see the glue drops that are supposed to be holding it together. I have only had this thing sitting on my desk and I believe the culprit may be the heat.  Definitely concerned about this and will be reaching out to iRulu.  Other than this the touch screen works very well and probably my only con of the unit would be the smaller keyboard and the shift key placement. Very hard for me to get used to this and has almost made me think about the surface 3 with the wider keyboard but the difference in $ is the big issue. This thing for the price is hard to beat. I have upgraded the unit to Windows 10 which did take a LOOOOONG TIME but appears to be working great except for the right click menu does not fully show any of the menu items. Its like a very thing vertical menu which you cannot see the choices. I'm hoping another iRulu owner might have a fix."}

So I called customer service at IRULU. The phone was answered by a very friendly helpful person who told me that at this time they were experiencing some glitches in up-grading to  Windows 10 and they recommended waiting until they were worked out, which they expected to be soon, to try again. We own a PC and a Kindle and both my husband and I like this because it has a bigger screen than the Kindle and is easy to read, I can easily install Google Photos, it's lightweight yet seems sturdy and durable; we really like the touch-screen.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "I like it so far. here are my reasons\n\nThe Good:\n1. Great price for a tablet hybrid like this one, others like the ASUS T100 cost around 150 more\n2. Full size USB, Micro HDMI (or mini, i keep confusing the two), this makes this device great for multiple things such as gaming on the go and hooking up to TVs\n3. I love the case that comes with it! it folds up nice and neat but can act as a study stand on hard surfaces. the magnetized connected helps to hold the tablet to the case really well.\n4. Free year of office 365!\n5. The screen has good viewing angles and looks good streaming Hulu, youtube, etc.\n6. 2 GB of ram, most all budget tablets only use one GB now days, which is fine for viewing email, but the extra gig opens up some (limited) gaming options\n7. Dual speakers which are nice and loud, most other tablets only have one and are low volume.\n8. the battery life seems decent, however when gaming, expect this to drop, shave about an hour or 2. can really count this as a con as the device is not intended to game (its an added bonus)\n\nThe Bad:\nThere is a Micro USB port on the device, other reviews state that they have charged it via Micro USB but when i asked support, i was told this was not and option. it uses a stick connector to charge. personally i feel that in 2015, all devices should charge via Micro USB, the old fashion DC connectors should be left in the past where they belong :), if im mistaken, please comment and correct me and i will re rate . another note regarding the charger, this thing get pretty hot while charging.\n\nThe Ugly:\nThis thing gets HOT when under load. i played Warcraft II and III for around an hour, and checking the temps, it was registering a max of  60c on the temp software, granted the Atoms critical shutdown is at 90c. to be fair, this is  passive cooled and perhaps where the device is thin, im feeling more heat than the thicker tablets. and again, this is not intended for gaming heavily. i also noticed the heat while watching movies for a couple of hours. I travel on the job, so this becomes my travel computer basically."}

The storage space on board is very limited and Windows 10 doesn't allow you to store your Apps on an memory card at this time, so that is a concern going forward. Not a problem with the device, more so Windows 10. The battery does run hot to the touch when tablet is in use for a long period of time or charging.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "I have used this tablet about 8 months now. I originally received it free in exchange for a review. However, after I reviewed it, I kept using it up through the current time. Here is my honest opinions of this tablet.\n  I would not upgrade this to windows 10. This tablet runs great on 8.1 and windows 10 can lag down a much heftier system. Now, I have not tried that with this tablet. I just would not do it based on specs. After using Windows 10 through beta I can say you will not miss much by not having it on this tablet. I have 4 desktops that I built myself. 1 That I just purchased from IBUYPOWER. Windows 10 lags them. I currently am running intel core i5 with 32 gbs ram plus a amd r390 video card with 8 gbs memory hooked up to a 49 inch 4k monitor and it lags me at times,.\n\nThis tablet is great for what it does. It can read a 128 gb micro sd card. You actually can install to the card and play diablo 3 off of it. It will not get 40 fps. But it is a great option when away from main gaming computers. Also, this tablet plays stream games like Borderland 2. You again will not get high fps, but it is playable in an enjoyable way. When I say that I mean for under $200.00 this will be one of your better options to play a game when away from home.\n  I have had several laptops that could not even play Diablo 3 or Borderlands. So I was really happy this one actually worked for a bit of gaming as well as work. It also plays Hearthstone.\n  Did You get the part of it reads a 128 GB Card? That allows me to have a ton of movies on this baby. Plus all my music.\nI look at this as a entertainment center. I use a usb splitter to hook up a normal size keyboard and mouse. I also can hook up a usb dvd player if needed.\nThen this becomes a really nice and inexpensive laptop. I personally have no issues with smaller keyboards but my husband does. His fingers needs the normal keyboard and I usually use it out of habit.  I also normally use this tablet while it is plugged in beside desk since I have to have room for keyboard and mouse.\n  Now for when I take off and go away from home, or want to lay in bed. This tablet is perfect for that. It can hook up to a hdmi moniter. Now, honestly in bed, I do not hook it to one. But, at my desk I do. I like the bigger screen. The problem with a bigger screen is it takes more energy to fill all those pixels. That is why I keep mine plugged in.\n\n  I hope your getting the idea how versatile this tablet is and its under $200.00\n\n  So far I have covered games ,movies, and music, how bout work? Well it runs and comes free with a year of Office 365. It prints easily if your hooked up to your wifi network. Also, you could add in a lan dongle to get higher speeds if you wanted to for very little investment.\nI have Amazon Prime, so This works perfectly watching all those free movies. The picture is honestly great.\n\nNext thing I want to discuss is weight. I have problems with my hands. I can not hold heavy objects long. My hands will do a \"spock\" on me. With my fingers cramping and drawing to weird positions that I normally could never do if I intentionally tried. So being lightweight is important for when I am laying in bed on tablet/computer. This one does not make my hands as tired as quickly as others I have tried. I can not do a laptop long at all.\nI also have circulation problems so it is important that I put my feet up at times. So holding this on my lap in the recliner works ok. I do not like laying back and doing this. But, If I have to it really does fit my needs on that point.\n  The next thing I want to discuss is storage.,\nThis ends up with about 22 gbs free after windows is installed with updates. But it reads a 128 gb microsd card as I have said, but also I use Google drive. Google drive is a storage program that allows you to store 15 more gbs. If you google free online storage your going to find a good bit of programs that allows you to store stuff on the cloud. I also use drop box. Amazon prime allows unlimited photo storage. My main thought here is if you need more you can easily get to about 200-250 gbs of storage or more if you store online as well as on the card plus the internal hard drive.\n\nOne thing I have not addressed is this actually can take pictures and you can skype on it. It is awkward but convenient to use the camera in it if you have it in your hands. I have only Skyped once and it worked fine and looked ok. So that is all I can say about that.\nBottom line, look at this tablet as a entertainment center that is expandable if you think outside of the box. It is extremely versatile and easy to use.\nOnce a beginner learns Windows 8.1 they would love this tablet. On up to someone like me with way to many computers around who still finds it very useful."}

You will definitely want to get a micro SD card for extra space. It's fast, and scrolling is smooth. Streaming HD video is no problem, and it'll play some decently hardware hungry games.\n  The keyboard is nice actually. The magnet that holds it to the tablet is plenty strong enough, and the tablet recognizes it right away. I like the folding \"kickstand\" that doubles as the back of the folding case.\n  The only gripe I have is the wifi is limited to 2.4ghz band only.\n\nI would recommend this to anyone who wants a good sized tablet for office work or just to have fun with on a long trip."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "It's a great for traveling I can say that much. But it does not have enough memory to handle very much at all, so if you do a lot of multitasking you need to cut that down some when using this. It says it's great for gaming, it's not. It's a very poor choice if you want to use it for any gaming. I've only installed Skype and MalwareBytes into it, then when I installed steam and tested out only installing Skullgirls, it just frustrated me with insane lag and low memory warnings. Even when ending background process of Skype and MalwareBytes it improved just Slightly. I'm giving this four stars because if you're informed on how much memory and RAM specific games need then you should be able to gauge by the information provided. Personally I settled with a few Final Fantasy favorites, Undertale and Contrast. It runs well with those. Not anymore though. I did buy it for work and school though, and it serves those purposes very well, just don't expect this to hold more than a few small indie games. For League fans out there, I can tell you it's a strong no, good luck even getting into a game.\nBuy it as a a carry on for work and school, don't buy it if you want it to be anymore than that. I wouldn't suggest it as your main pc, but then again I don't think I'll ever suggest a tablet or laptop as your main pc. It is 64x compatible, if you hope to upgrade it and spend extra money on making it do more, but in my opinion the screen and keyboard is too small to enjoy most games to begin with. It IS very small, you need to adjust to the keyboard size and it only has one usb port which is annoying because I like to use my actual wireless mouse."}

Therefore, I decided to return the tablet. Ultimately, a very frustrating experience."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "I am historically quite an anti-Windows type of person.  I've been using Linux as a desktop OS since 1994, and only use Windows when required.  For my mobile device needs I only have Android devices, which I have been using for many years as well.\n\nI recently took a job that required a lot of air travel, and found that my aging Android tablet was becoming quite poor in performance and feeling very 'old', and felt it was time for an upgrade.  I priced out a lot of Android tablets, and had a pretty specific price range ($250 or less).  Most Android options had significant compromises for prices that low.\n\nI started to look at hybrid 2-in-1 tablets as I purchased a similar item (Acer with detachable keyboard) for my parents as a gift, and they love it.  I figured at this price range on this device, coupled with the 'beta' testing that my parents did, I figured it was worth the risk.\n\nI'm so glad I did!  With most Android tablets, an sdcard slot is hit or miss on whether you even get one, and USB thumbdrive or external USB drives are usually not easily an option either.  This device solved that problem for me.  When traveling I prefer to stock up on a number of movies on an external drive or sdcard, this tablet allows both (simultaneously if you like).\n\nIt is basically a windows PC in tablet form as far as its capabilities.  I have felt the performance of it is very good, and do not have any of the issues with the UI I've seen in some reviews.  The touchscreen behaves like any other Windows touchscreen I've seen or used.\n\nThe screen is quite nice in appearance, and has good black levels in darker movies.\n\nFor me, this device is more \"tablet with a handy keyboard\" and less \"a laptop that has a keyboard that detaches\", and I only mean that in form factor, not in performance.  Performance has been quite impressive, but I am a fairly large guy, and the keyboard is quite small.  If you can adjust to the small keyboard, it would work quite well as a small laptop, but for me the keyboard is simply there to make quick typing a bit easier.  I would save long e-mails (or Amazon reviews!) for when I'm on a normal keyboard.\n\nI do not consider the keyboard to me a fault for the device however.  The quality of the build of the device and the keyboard is quite impressive, equating very closely to a standard surface tablet in \"quality feel\".  The touchpad on the keyboard is a nice touch as well, making it not necessary to have a USB mouse.\n\nBattery life was pretty good, better than I anticipated.  I use this on mostly domestic US flights that are about 4 hour flights on average.  Since this is a tablet device, I can start watching a movie the moment I sit down before the flight takes off, and usually do.  I will often watch 2 two-hour movies non-stop until landing, and the device usually has the screen on the entire time.  Upon landing the lowest my battery has been was around 35%, but usually its still around 50% when landing (after 4 hours of straight video watching).\n\nOn flights where an AC outlet is present, the only problem is the power cable is a bit short in length, and it is a proprietary connector.  It seems a bit clunky to pack an extension power cord in the carry-on, so an international flight might be an issue.  I do intend to try and find a generic power cable that matches the connector/voltage/etc but with a longer cable.\n\nAll in all this device vastly exceeded my expectations based on its price.  I feel like I bought a 400-600$ device at a significantly cheaper price, and do not feel that I made any sacrifices."}

Which only made matters worse as I was invited to choose one box or the other, but \"if you don't know which option is right for you, contact someone you trust to help with this.\"  All the people I trust, unfortunately, use Apple devices, and after my experiences with this, I don't blame them.\n\nWhile it was working, the tablet was slow but usable.

It's is plenty powerful to do anything that an iPad would do, and it is full Windows so it can do things an iPad can't. You can update to Windows 10 fairly easily, but you will need to have a 16 gig micro as card installed to do this. So buy a cheap $10 micro SD card and update away.  This tablet also has a full sized USB port, which is my favorite bonus feature... Why not 5 starts??? I guess just because it is slightly heavy for pure tablet use.  I hate to give 5 stars up too easily.  The included keyboard is a nice bonus. As a note I have bought at least 6 of these for clients and they have all worked perfectly."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "Great tablet for the money.  Easily gets mistaken for a Surface when out in public with the cover keyboard (included in the box).  Comes factory installed with Windows 8.1 and CAN BE UPDATED TO WINDOWS 10.  Just be sure to have a USB thumb drive or Micro SD card (device is equiped with 1 USB 2.0 and Micro SD is good for up to 128gb) with at least 10gb free as the internal HDD is not sufficient for the upgrade.\n\nPerformance wise, it does what it needs to do and fairly well.  Broadwell processor is snappy and efficient.  2gb of ram may seem a little on the short side but multi-tasking is not an issue.  Not the best gaming machine, obviously, but will play older games with ease (Tested Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver).  The screen isn't the absolute best at 1280x800.  You can do much worse but, due to the price, this can hardly count as a complaint.  Battery life is surprisingly good, can easily go all day with moderate use and brightness.  Sound exists, can't expect much from any devices such as these. I am knocking down 1 star for the following reasons:\n\n1.  Mini HDMI port - not the most common but compromise lies in a cheap, simple adapter.\n2.  Charging port - does NOT use Micro USB for charging (come to think of it, not sure what that's for) It uses a proprietary 2.5mm barrel charger.  Once again, replacements can be found on Amazon for dirt cheap.\n3.  Only available in 2 colors, bright green and orange.  The color doesn't color the whole tablet, just the bezel.  Not too obnoxious, but a minor annoyance\n\nLooking for an ultra portable Windows tablet for little compromise?  Pick this thing up.  You'll be surprised."}

It finally broke on September  25, 2015. This was four months and ten days after we purchased it. We contacted customer service since they said they have a one year warranty. To say I am disappointed is an understatement.  They want me to send them 50% of the purchase price to a gmail account via paypal.  \"Please send the payment via PayPal. Our email address is \"hyperay.ebay\"\" I want people to know that when they purchase this product, they are not buying from a company that stands by their product.  Furthermore, they will accuse you of extortion when you tell them that you will let others know about their customer service (or lack thereof).  This is the quote from their customer service. \"I really don't study US laws. But it sure sounds like coercion to me. At the very least, what you suggested is what people call \"feedback extortion.\" For your information, if I'm correct, blackmail, extortion and coercion are all federal crimes.\" I always wait six months to leave feedback on electronics.  Things happen, like this, and it is good to give people real life long-term use comments.  In this case, if they had replaced the unit that broke, I would have left them a perfect five star review.  I would have told everyone they made it right.  However, this is sadly not the case.  They do not care about US customers."}

There really needs to be micro USB charging capabilities like virtually every other device in the world has.\n\n* Keyboard is CHEAP.  It has developed an unexplainable warp and will not sit flat.  The connector comes disconnected from the tablet if you even think about looking at it wrong causing windoes to play loud notification sounds repeatedly.\n\nOther than that this seems like a creaming deal.

The Walknbook and the 8-in. tablet have nearly identical specifications, but the Walknbook has a 10.1-in. display, and a full-sized USB port.  I paid the same for both (<$200.)\nI'm very pleased with the Walknbook tablet itself: all of the hardware worked out of the box, no bad pixels in the display, and the battery had nearly a full charge, which let me start working with it immediately.  I didn't use the included case/keyboard/mouse, but it's heavy, and looks like it would work well.  As others have mentioned, the charger gets hot, but not over 120F (it won't burn you!)\nFor my application, the 32GB SSD is plenty, but I do wish there was a provision for moving the recovery partition to an external drive, so that you could reclaim the ~8GB of storage space (other tablets I've used offer this feature.)  Due to an unexpected error, I had to Reset Windows 8.1, and the procedure ran flawlessly.\nThe included Quick Start Guide is another story.  Two of the 12 pages highlight the hardware features of the tablet, with illustrations that are too small to read.  Seven more pages poorly attempt to demonstrate the use of Windows 8.1, and the single page, \"Precautions before Use,\" is just hard to read.  It would be helpful to have a complete users manual that could be downloaded.\nThere was also a little doo-dad included in the box, but no description or explanation of what it's for (see picture.)\nAll-in-all, I'm satisfied with my purchase.  If I'd wanted a general-purpose tablet, though, I would've looked at something that cost a bit more and offered more processor speed, memory and storage."}

Touch screen is very responsive no lag.  I am however very disappointed with the keyboard/touch pad which is very cheap and flimsy. Touch pad was completly  useless.  I wound up purchasing a Tabsuit Dragon Touch i10X Ultra Slim SmartShell Stand Cover for $20,  what a difference that made, better keyboard and great touch pad,  fits the Walknbook perfectly.\n\nNext thing you should consider is the fact that you are pretty much stuck using windows 8.1 (w/bing), It's NOT Pro.  If you upgrade to Windows 10 you can forget about using the touch screen (search the internet to see for yourself). Windows 10 is geared towards non touch screen computers.\n\nOh yeah, I should mention that you cannot disable uefi boot.  So any usb's or cd's you have that's not in Irulu's uefi specifications will NOT boot period.  Good luck finding a backup restore program that will boot up, cause it won't.\n\nOne important thing to note is that even though it says 32 gig memory, straight outta the box you really only have 17 gigs free. Buy an SD card and install your programs to it instead of the default C-Drive."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "I really wish I could give this a 3.5 stars, it's actually better than 3, but not as good as 4.\n\nThe tablet is exactly what the description says it is. It has a decent set of hardware for the price. Upgrading to Windows 10 took FOREVER due to the \"speed\" of this device, but once upgraded it's anything but sluggish. Common tablet usage such as playing games, browsing the web, etc, are all handled with ease.\n\nThe downsides of this particular unit;\n\nThe build quality feels lacking. The power button is hardly accessible, short of using your finger nail. One corner of the back panel creaks a little, as if it's not fully glued in. The micro-USB connect appears to have no obvious function, and the included keyboard/cover is worthless.\n\nFinally, the power brick that came with this unit gets INCREDIBLY hot. Not only that, but the tablet itself (presumably the battery) gets really hot when charging. I simply picked up another 2.5mm to USB cable and charge with a normal power adapter, which solved both problems - highly recommended.\n\nDespite what sounds like negative comments, I'd actually buy this again.\n\n**EDIT 11/15/2015**\nI'm downgrading my review from 3 stars to 1. I've had pixels die on my screen to the point of being very noticeable and distracting, but every attempt I've made to contact iRulu for a warranty claim has been ignored. Their website lists \"sales@irulu.com\" as the address to contact for warranty support, but when you actually try and use your warranty they just ignore you. I've sent 3 emails over the course of over 1 week, within a single reply.\n\nIf you value your money, I'd recommend purchasing a product manufactured by a company who actually stands behind their products.\n\nIF/WHEN iRulu should actually respond and honor their warranty, I'll reconsider this negative review."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "I had been looking for a decent/affordable Windows 8.1 tablet for a while, so you can imagine my excitement when I discovered this one in particular. Like I said, I had been in the market for a while, and really needed something to fill my day to day school needs. I felt pretty good about the ratio of positive to negative reviews, and decided to take the plunge. So far, I have been extremely pleased.\n\nPros:\n1. The display is beautiful and is the perfect size. I mostly use the tablet for handwriting notes on top of PowerPoints and pdfs for class, but it also works great for killing some time on the internet browsing, shopping on Amazon, using Spotify, etc.\n\n2. It's faster than I expected. It's definitely not a powerhouse/speed machine, but I have never felt like it was 'slow' for anything I have needed to do.\n\n3. It's a good weight: not too heavy/not too light. It feels sturdy and with the leather folio case I think it could withstand a drop or two. I also highly recommend the tempered glass screen protector--no loss of display quality and very little drag. I honestly forgot that I had bought it until I wrote this review.\n\n4. This is hands-down the best cost/quality ratio I've found for a daily driver tablet. $200 and some change for the tablet and all the accessories I needed.\n\nCons:\n1. Kind of frustrating that it isn't charged via microUSB. If the adapter goes out, it'll be pretty aggravating do go buy one from RadioShack or some dino store.\n\n2. It charges pretty slowly. However, I've found this isn't really a big deal if I remember to plug it in overnight. The battery DOES last long enough for me to use it at school all day, but I also don't use it every single class period.\n\n3. It isn't upgradeable to W10 on it's own. I have NOT gotten a microSD to test it, but many have said they have upgraded their walknbooks to W10 and have had few/no issues with it. 8.1 fulfills my needs for so it's not a priority right now.\n\nMisc:\nThe keyboard is pretty small but it does the trick. I mostly write on-screen so I haven't used it much, but if I wanted to skip taking my laptop for whatever reason, I'm confident it would get the job done.\n\nI haven't had any major issues yet, and I feel confident that this will last me for a few years. My only regret is that I hadn't picked it up sooner. I've recommended it to a few friends that may be purchasing one in the near future.\n\nI highly recommend this tablet, but I would probably give it 5 stars if it was upgradeable to W10 on its own and was charged via microUSB."}

The awkward sizing has caused a lot more typos for me than you might think.\n\nSide Note:\n\nI upgraded this device to Windows 10, and I found that I actually enjoyed Windows 8.1 more.\nI did try to downgrade the OS back to Windows 8.1 from Windows 10 and I found that I just could not."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "This is actually a very nice and solid feeling tablet. Initially I wondered if the 10.1 inch might be a bit large for me, but it's actually not. The tablet has a wider screen than some other tablets (such as Apple, which is a bit more square), but I got used to this pretty quickly. It's great for using around the house and stuff, but I do think I would still prefer something slightly smaller (such as a 7 or 8 inch) for traveling and vacationing.\n\nThe tablet has nice response times and I've had very few problems with it in the few weeks that I've had it. It handles my games (soda crush, crossy roads, etc) and other apps well and has no lagging or stalling unless it's installing or updating other apps in the background, which is a feature that I believe can be turned off. The bluetooth function is a great addition to the tablet and works well. I've used it to stream music to a separate bluetooth speaker that I have, and I'm able to carry the tablet all around the house without losing connection to the speaker.\n\nThe battery life is actually quite good. I generally go several days in between charges. Here's a tip: I've gotten into the habit of sometimes turning airplane mode on when I won't be using the tablet for several hours. This stops apps from checking for updates, etc, and it definitely makes the battery last longer. It's easy to toggle airplane mode on and off by holding down the power button for 1 second and waiting for the screen prompt.\n\nAnother nice little thing is that it came with a screen protector pre-installed, which I didn't expect at all since it really wasn't documented. (Unfortunately mine came with a couple unremovable bubbles, but I can overlook this as I much prefer the protection to having a bare screen.) All that was required was for me to peel off the top layer and it was all set. However, I am a little concerned that some customers may remove the entire screen protector thinking that it is just a temporary shipping film. I would suggest the company somehow make it known to customers that the tablet comes with a screen protector pre-installed.\n\nThe one feature that is a bit lacking is the camera. You can take photos and videos, and it does have both front and rear cameras, but the quality is not all that great. Photos end up looking more like a painting instead of a photo. (I've included two samples, one photo taken indoors and one taken outdoors.) The camera on the front is positioned in one of the corners which is not ideal for skyping or video calls....but that's not one of my main uses so it's not a huge problem for me.\n\nOverall, this really is a pretty nice android tablet. If you can deal with the less than perfect camera issues, this seems like a great deal at the current price of $90. The build quality seems very nice, and it's snappy enough that I find myself reaching for it just as much, if not more, than my ipad mini. I'm very happy with it, and I think it would be a very nice choice for someone looking for a nice (not cheap) tablet on a somewhat limited budget. An evaluation sample was provided in exchange for my honest opinion of the product."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "So I had an Acer laptop before this purchase and I had a rage quit while playing Skyrim and I punched the screen and spiderwebbed the screen.  Later, I had another rage quit and smacked my fist on the keyboard which messed up the harddrive and rendered the Acer inoperable.  So I bought the iRulu Walknbook as a cheaper replacement.  I have been playing Clash of Clans on it(Bluestacks), and I occasionally have rage quits.  I have punched this machine extremely hard.  Sometimes I have to hold the screen in place while with my left hand while I punch it with my right hand. Despite the abuse, the iRulu tablet did not break and still works great, but I have sore knuckles and think that I may have fractured my pinky finger.\n  Anyhow,  for under 200 dollars, I have to give this machine 5 stars because it is remarkably tough and that is not something you can say about a lot of the fragile electronics equipment manufactured nowadays."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "I really wanted to like this tablet.  It feels like a solid build, the keyboard is very nice except the touchpad is a little sensitive when you are trying to type.  The screen is very clear, and although some do not think the speaker is loud enough, I found it more than adequate.  It is not the fastest PC on the planet, but it only has 2GB ram, so I expected it.  It has plenty of ports and for the price, it is an extremely good deal.\n\nWhere it fails completely for me is the 16GB of storage available when you receive it.  I know this is common practice with computer manufacturers to advertise the total storage before the operating system and software is installed, but they need to stop it!  16GB is not enough storage for a Windows 8.1 tablet.  It is enough for an Android tablet because Android apps are small, but Windows apps are not.  Just installing the free Office 365 uses up almost all of the remaining free storage. I've seen suggestions to put an usb drive on it and install software to that, but that is not an adequate solution.  If I need to buy an external drive, why didn't the manufacturer just include 64GB and charge a little more?  Anyway, that's why I decided to return it.  If they come out with a 64GB version of this tablet, they will have a happy customer."}

Looks great and comes with an attachable key board and really nice suede cover with a back that pops up into a stand (magnetized), which is AWESOME if you've ever had a tablet before and had to buy a stand separately. It runs win8 which works well with it, being a tablet of course.\nMy only complaints are it's internals. It doesn't have much space, which isn't a problem unless you want to upgrade to Win10 for free...because there isn't enough space on the HD to do that...Also, it's specs are pretty low, so good luck running more than one or two apps at a time. It even has trouble running Adobe for PDF's, tends to catch often and load pages slowly. Additionally, unless you are playing chess, forget about games, not built for that.\nFor work, portability, and standard movies/music media this is an awesome tablet for the money, def recommended!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "I've been using this tablet for about a month now and I am amazed by its proformance. This is a low cost alternative to windows surface tablet.\nOut if the box it comes with a full version of windows 8.1. It's a complete full version, not windows RT or a bootleg version. But the real deal. As soon as you turn it on it will ask you if you want to upgrade to windows 10 for free. I'm assuming you will be put on a waiting list until they update it for you. I decided to update on my own through the Microsoft website using their media creation tool. I am glad I did. This tablet runs awesome with wi does 10. The fact that it comes with the detachable keyboard makes it very easy to switch between tablet and desktop mode. Both modes work very well on this tablet.\n\nBox: The tablet comes packaged well in a nice box. Just by Looking at the box you get the feeling what's inside is high quality. The tablet is packaged inside well to insure no damaged. The screen has a plastic protector on top of the screen protector it already comes preinstalled. The extra layer is to insure the screen protector does not get scratched or damaged during transport.\n\nTablet Durability: The rim of the tablet is a hard plastic, kind of like a bumper which helps to keep the screen from cracking. The all of feel is nice and heavy. As soon as you pick it up you know you have a good quality product.\n\nPorts and Switches: The rim has 1 usb 2.0 ports, one mini HDMI port, 1 sad card slot, 1 micro sub port, headphone port, and power cable port. Left side has the power button and the top has the volume up and down switch. The top also has two speakers which put out a decent sound. The bottom has the magnetic port for the attachable keyboard.\n\nAccessories included: The only accessories included are the power adapter, screen protector and the attachable keyboard/stand.\nThe power adapter is a standard 2 prong US adapter. I have noticed that when charging the adapter and the left side of the tablet gets fairly hot but as of now haven't caused any issues. It does have an automatic shutoff for when it's fully charged. Once it shuts off it cools fairly quickly. Charger is Input:100-240v-50/60Hz 0.35A. Output:5V 2000mA\nThe screen protector isn't the best. Actually it's pretty poor quality. I had to remove mine within a few days because the keyboard was scratching it up. The screen looks much better once it was removed. The keyboard is an excellent accessory. It works awesome as a stand as well. Keys make a nice clicking sound. The over all build is very high quality. The magnetic hold is strong enough that you can hold the tablet in the air without the keyboard coming off. Now I need to mention the keyboard does not have any of its own power. It only works when connected to the tablet.\n\nThe tablet runs just as you would expect with the specs that are provided by the manufacturer. irulu put a lot of effort in to this tablet and I think it soon it will be in the running with other high brand name devices.\n\n\"I Paid Full Price For This Product\""}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "So far so good. It had been around 1 month since purchase and the product seems excellent. Here some of my thoughts:\n\nThe good:\n- Run a full Windows 8.1 version, which means I was able to install anything I can on my desktop PC\n- 1 Year Microsoft Office, not bad at all.\n- 1 Year limited warranty. Which is pretty good deal when you consider they accept return during a period and then replacement.\n- Good screen resolutions and ports.\n- Keyboard, seems decent. I don't use it too much since I don't like the be around with a keyboard. I bought a more protective cover at amazon. .\n- The structure of the tablet seems pretty solid, not a squishy one.\n- So far, battery life is great. Not counted the time, but enough use without need to charge when I compare it to my laptop or my nexus tablet.\n\nThe not so good\n- The charging port is not USB. Not a big deal until you figure out you left the charger somewhere, not close.\n- Left-lower side of the tablet can turn a bit warm, possibly for the micro-porcessor. Not a big deal, at least its just warm, not hot...\n- It comes with a screen protector and back protector. Thats great, but they got some bubbles... I  just buy a new 3-pack on Amazon and solved.\n\nConclusion:\nFor $199 this tablet is a great deal in comparison with competitors. You can get a Surface Pro or an Acer for $600 / $400 respectively, but the price of this tablet and the warranty made me give a try. To be honest, so far, so good.\n\nResources:\nHere's an unboxing video I made... so you can have an idea what to expect out of the box...\nhttps://youtu.be/_wOQh8Q3eCY\n\nTo point out:\nThe company offers an extended 1 year prime warranty if you left a sincere opinion. Well, this is one. Otherwise I would have returned the tablet and be writing something else here."}

I am used to a fuller sized keyboard and this is a little smaller.  The machine was a little slow when upgrading to Windows 10 but with only 2GB of RAM and a 32GB drive you would expect it.  If you do the upgrade you will need an SD card to have enough space to store the files for the upgrade.  After the upgrade to 10 the touch screen didn't work but an update in windows and support at irulu sent my an update also but the Windows update seemed to fix the touch screen issue.\n\nEditing my review to note that the battery is pretty bad.  It loses charge all the time even when completely shutdown.  It has trouble charging when powered on and in use also.  At this point, wish I would have spend more on a Surface 3 etc."}

However, for now, I'm tremendously pleased with my purchase. One thing I'd like to mention before closing is the fact that after set-up and the Win10 free upgrade, your actual GB is not as described. But that's not the manufacturer's fault. That strictly the issue of a Windows based OS. However, that is easily fixed by purchasing a 128 micro usb w/adapter. And please make sure you charge the deice completely before going through initial set-up and/or Win10 update."}

I initially liked the keyboard because it is not too small for my fingers, and it functions very well.  The down side of the item is that the keyboard only props up in one position, which make it difficult to use for typing unless you are sitting in a chair and at a table.  That's why I gave this item 4 stars.  Other than that, I am pretty impressed with the product and have recommended it to friends."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "Update: 7/23/15 - I want to reiterate the usefulness of a supplemental BT keyboard. I picked a $10 HP lightweight keyboard up off of newegg and love every bit of it. I mounted the tablet to an IPow magnet and a custom stand. I added a real time photo to show the setup.\n\nUpdate 6/6/15: The tablet has handled everything that i've thrown at it and runs smooth and cool.\n\nUpdate 5/15: I'm loving this tablet! I've used it for a'll facets of my job and it has yet to come up short. The battery life is fantastic. The crisp screen shines at viewing angles that are truly impressive.\n\nWord of advice, make sure to remove both pieces of plastic that cover the screen. One hid itself very well. Also, turn the brightness up to get the full experience. One pic added from Niagara Falls '..End update.\n\nWhen Irulu approached me to review their Windows Tablet I happily obliged. Im a reviewer by hobby but a tech nerd at heart. To solidify that point I can tell you that I have seven tablets, two computers, a moto360, virtual reality headset and more BT connected devices than Radioshack in its prime, okay BT devices didn't exist in Radioshacks prime but you get the point. I hope that my experience helps you make a well informed decision.\n\nMy issue with tablets since day 1 was their tendency to be consumption devices rather than production. What I mean is that they were good for Netflix or Youtube but if your boss emails you, go ahead and pull back out that laptop. Tablets never solved a need, they were just cool. I truly feel that windows enabled tablets like the Walknbook have changed all of that. The high portability paired with functional tools like Microsoft Office make a world of a difference. This isn't an addition to your tech, its a replacement.\n\nThe Walknbook does a lot right, from the customer service so the seamless integration and use of Windows, to the ultraportable and clever form factor. Ill break out my pro/cons then get into more depth after.\nPros:\n True Windows experience  This isn't Windows RT or some other derivation. This is a full and beautifully run Windows 8.1 System. I work heavily in spreadsheets and this has yet to disappoint. It comes packaged with a year of office. That means Word, Excel, Powerpoint are all instantly available at your fingertips.\n Long Batter life  10 hours + per charge. Charges very quick.\n Form factor  It just feels right. I found myself using the touchscreen for typing far more than the other 6 tablets that I own. I interact with the screen a lot.\n Bright clear and crisp screen  Great viewing angles! The resolution is perfect for a tablet of this size. Its not the highest of resolutions but for the price its definitely a good one. Ive had issues with other tables and their viewing angles. No issues here.\n Fast & responsive  2gb ram holds up well for daily tasks. No issues streaming videos or having multiple high powered applications open.\n PRICE - At less than $250 this is a steal. The hardware speaks for itself.\n BT Enabled - Never underestimate this. Can easily and quickly pair to speakers, keyboards and a mouse.\n Integrated keyboard charging - I have my issues with the keyboard and stand but I love that you can charge it through the tablet with the supplied micro-usb cable. I had a zoolander moment trying to find the input on the keyboard. Remember, it's on the tablet itself, not the keyboard.\n HDMI Out - Allowa you to project your work to the big screen (or any screen with an HDMI input)\nCons:\n Keyboard/Stand  The free and prepackaged stand is adequate but the lack of the ability to adjust the viewing angle is frustrating. Again, this was included and free so Im okay with it, but there is room for improvement.\n Two point capacitive touch screen  Im part of a small group of people that use google earth heavily for work. A 5 point capacitive touch screen would allow me to twist the earth as I work. A two point system doesnt allow for that. Given that this is a budget tablet Im okay with not having this feature, but it is something that I miss.\n\nSummary:\n\nThis tablet is very similar in design to the Surface Pro. Windows tablets are made for production and consumption. You will get work done while still having the convenience of a mobile device. The windows store is severely lacking when compared to the Android and Apple stores but they are making a strong push. Many reputable tech sources have high hopes for the future of the platform. Irulu has a great product on their hands. Its built like a tablet that costs 2-3 times the price.\n\nTL:DR:I recommend this above ANY other similarly priced tablet or laptop. As a matter of fact it's making it into my favorites list on my profile. If you want a robust game selection Android or Apple will have Windows based tablets beat. If you want a hybrid tablet that leverages the production power of Office then look no further. This is an amazing piece of tech for a steal of a price. My theory is that upcoming brands like Irulu give you more computer power per buck to offset the fear of buying from a brand thats not known as publicly as others.\n\nIn the spirit of reviewing Ill be using this tablet in place of my $1,000 Lenovo Yoga Pro 2. I will keep this review up to date and I plan to provide an update to you all within 2 weeks. So far this is a wonderfully built and priced tablet. Review written on the tablet with the provided keyboard.\n\nIm not affiliated nor employed by Irulu. I review products for fun. The time taken to write a quality review far exceeds the benefit of receiving the product itself. I hope that you found this review helpful, if you didn't please ask a question below. I typically respond within 24 hours.\n\nThank you for reading!"}

I couldn't find the cursor, it would not accept typing to do Google searches and I started getting messages that the usb device connected was not recognized when I didn't connect anything. I wrote a message on irulu's \"chat\" line ( which takes 12 hours for a response because of the time difference with, probably, China) and I was told to do a hard reset using a link they provided. That link was for an Android device and not relevant for this tablet. In addition the link stated to do a hard reset if the unit would not boot. Mine did boot and I questioned why I had to do a hard reset and lose all of the settings I made which took hours to do. I was told a second time to do the hard reset. I did as I was told feeling my way through the instructions because this us not an Android product. I was told to plug the unit charger in over night to do the reset. I did that and the charge only reached mid 90% after 14 hours, which indicates another upcoming problem.\nAfter going through the entire hard reset when I turned the unit on all my settings and data had been lost and it even had to reinstall Windows. Then, I STILL COULD NOT FIND THE CURSOR!\nI am sending it back to Amazon."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "I bought this tablet initially from Amazon but it had a few dead/stuck pixels, returned it for an exchange and irulu.com sent me another, brand new one. I must say that this thing is a miracle for the price and it has exceeded my expectations.\n\nThe build quality is surprisingly good, the rubberized green edges add a lot of grip to it (the iPad feels very slippery compared to this). The screen is exceptionally good, and despite the fact that the resolution isn't the greatest out there, for the screen size is it just enough in order to make it a joy to look it, and the fact that it's an IPS panel translates to exceptionally good colors and good viewing angles (I just wish it was dimmer at its dimmest setting, but that's just a personal preference). It has plenty of ports for a tablet, the speakers are in an ideal location and they perform surprisingly good (not as good as the iPad's, but they won't cause any concerns). The battery life is astonishing, I was expecting it to last way shorter than it does. It is probably comparable to that of the iPad's, but this is running the full Windows 8 instead of iOS.\n\nPerformance-wise, it is a very pleasant surprise. Navigating on the web with multiple tabs, keeping these on the screen and opening multiple applications at the same time, installing other apps, navigating through the (still ugly to me) metro interface while having other things open, these are all smooth and snappy all the time. Though, throwing some more serious stuff at it will probably start to show the hardware limitations that it has.\n\nAbout keyboard, is it an overall decent accessory. The mechanism for connecting the two is fine, the mechanism which keeps the tablet standing up is fine but has nothing special (wish it had more positions), the trackpad works fine (better than other windows laptops I saw) but the keyboard is a bit overcrowded. And the shift key is in a totally unusual location, it takes a bit of time to get used to it. But when you get used to it, it works good, I can't complain much about it. It is however really practical since it wraps around the tablet and protects it when you have the tablet in your bag (microsoft's tablet for surface doesn't do that).\n\nNow for the bad parts. The microphone seems to be delivering sounds that are not loud enough for a Skype call. This might be Skype's fault, but it doesn't bother me and I haven't tested further since I always have a headset around and so the sounds coming from the headset's microphone would be used. The two camera modules are not exceptionally good. They lack dynamic range, have bad colors, are not able to capture much detail. Don't get me wrong, the front one can be used just fine for videocalls and the image is relatively clear, but it suffers from the mentioned issues. Charging times are pretty high and it uses a proprietary charing port.\n\nI am still running Windows 8.1 on it since I didn't have time to get an USB stick to update it (yes, the update is officially provided at irulu.com, do not download Window 10 directly from Microsoft because you might have problems with the drivers).\n\nI would recommend this tablet to anyone. I had hundreds, if not thousands of products through my hands over the last years, this is a product that feels just one step below Microsoft's own tablet (which begins at $720 if you include the keyboard for that) despite the price that would make you believe it is not even worth trying it."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "I bought one of the green ones for my wife to replace her aging Nook.  She loved it, and I was impressed with it as well, so I ordered an orange one for me (this review is for mine). My father in law saw our tablets and ordered one for himself too. I'm wanting to give a detailed review for this device to help others in deciding if it is for them. Lastly, I was able to upgrade both of ours tablets to Windows 10, and I'm including the directions below for how to pull that off, as well as potential drawbacks you should consider!\nUsability:\nThis device actually performs better than I expected, and is even capable of running games. I downloaded Hydro Thunder Hurricane from the Windows 10 store, and it runs great of medium settings, and it is playable (20-30 fps) on high settings, so really, not bad!  They keyboard is a little small, and it seems that sometimes keys act like they are sticking somehow, and repeating until you press again to stop it (father in laws does this, not mine thankfully). They come with Windows 8.1 32 bit, and can be upgraded to Windows 10 with a little patience and care.\nBenchmarks really tell the story for those who wish to compare notes, PassMark rating: 426.4. CPU: 979. 2D Graphics: 128. 3D Graphics: 123.2. Memory Mark: 390.1. Disk mark: 296.9. Disk Read: 49.2 MB/s, Write: 13.5 MB/s, Random R/W: 19.4 MB/s. I ran the benchmarks on battery and plugged in, and the score was the same. There is a BIOS setting (Press F7 to access, by the way) that can increase performance by raising the thermal limit, but I wouldn't advise it.\nBattery life: My wife can read eBooks for 5-6 hours on 50% brightness. I have watched 4 hours of Netflix, and had 30% battery left, at 50% brightness.\nUpgrading to Windows 10 is a time consuming process (think: 10 hours). Start with a clean, virgin device for best results. Get a 8 GB USB memory stick, plug it in, and create recovery media (copy recovery partition to USB drive).  Then download the Windows 10 USB Media creation tool, 32 bit. Get a second 8 GB USB drive, and let the tablet download the installer and write it to the USB drive. if this is a clean device, you should activate your Office 365 subscription now, so you won't lose it. Just start office from the start screen, and follow directions. Don't download and install office right now, just get the voucher redeemed. At this point, you'll want to back up all of your personal data if you have any on the device, as you're going to wipe it next.  Go to system settings, recovery, reset, and tell it to delete your data. it will take several hours to finish. DO NOT INTERRUPT IT!  (If it fails for any reason, that's why you created your recovery drive. Follow the directions to restore windows 8.1 by booting to it with F7.)  Normally, Windows 8.1 will reset and come back up clean, ready for you to log in with your Microsoft account. DON'T.  Just create a local account, and connect to WiFi.  Plug in the Windows 10 install USB drive you created. Start setup, and let it check for updates. This means, drivers, and critical updates, and you WANT THAT.  This will take 1-2 hours. It will ask you what you want to keep. Choose KEEP NOTHING. it will take 1-2 hours more, then it will reboot and do the upgrade. This part takes 2-3 hours, so just watch a movie or something while it runs.  When it's all done, you'll log in with your MS account (or create one, whatever), and then run disk cleanup (this computer -> C drive, right click, properties. Click Disk Cleanup. It will scan, then you click Clean up system files. it will scan again.  select everything. Click OK, and WAIT.  It will take a little while. Now you can download Office 365 and install any games and programs you wish!\nA NOTE ABOUT WINDOWS 10 COMPATIBILITY: I have not gotten the gravity sensor on mine working, which means it won't switch from landscape to portrait and back when physically rotating the device. This also means that racing games that use that sensor don't see it! If this matters to you, stay on windows 8 for now until IRULU releases their own upgrade disk for Windows 10."}

The Win 10 updated stated it needed more space so I responded by selecting the microSD card as being available for more space. W10 update done. The screen resolution is great. Battery life for watching MP4 movies is 3-6 hours but more testing needed by me. The included keyboard with touchpad is another nice feature and overall this is a well made product. For $200 you cannot go wrong and this is a serious competitor to the outrageously priced Microsoft Surface."}

I contacted iRulu which forwarded me to Amazon and got \" sorry out of warranty \" response. Good tablet for a year. Personally I won't buy from this brand again.\n\nOrdered IRulu Walknbook 10.1 Hybrid Laptop (the green one) Windows 8.1 was preloaded and had it upgraded to Windows 10, that took several hours so be prepared. You'll want to add a Micro SD (Sandisk Ultra 32GB not included) because Windows 10 is a big file and won't fit on the tablets internal hard drive. Inserted the Micro SD and it loaded very quickly and was able to use right away. The wireless keyboard is, honestly, a gift because the tablet is worth the $199 and works fine (it is a little on the flimsy and sometimes a glitch here and there but again it's a gift) Apps run smoothly, I installed malware, spyware, and antivirus without any problems but it is slow to scan (more of a overnight thing for very thorough scans ) The Microphone is nice to have but for serious microphone usage a third party one will be needed. I'm ordering a HDMI cord to hook up to my television I'm very hopeful for that and Finally the touchscreen is very responsive no issues whatsoever. I'll be getting a wireless keyboard for the TV use of it. The only Con would be the power input and micro USB are not as one. That would have been nice because micro USB is more common than the 2.5mm round pin connector.\n\nOverall very pleased with the product would be very open to a 2nd one for the kids or future models because it is affordable for my use."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "This tablet is so great! If you had asked me before I contacted customer support, though, you'd hear something entirely different.\n\nWhen I opened the package and began set-up, right away the tablet prompted me to install Windows 10. Which I did.  10 is so much better than 8.1, right?\n\nWell, here's what I learned. It might mean all the difference to you in choosing a budget Windows tablet.\n\nAs far as initial impressions went, I didn't like that there were bubbles trapped in the LCD display, but I decided I could live with that. However, when I finally got Windows 10 installed and updated - a very slow process - I had a device that would barely run. Web pages took forever to load, and every few minutes, the darn thing \"encountered a problem and needed to shut down.\" It would start back up okay, but boy did it labor along! Even worse, the wireless connection would drop, and then the device couldn't detect my network again until I had restarted the system. Between rebooting itself every 10 minutes or so, and me restarting it to wirelessly connect, my WalknBook was powered off more than it was running. And that took me from merely irked to outright angry. What good is a tablet that won't run?\n\nSo I asked for a return authorization, and a new tablet was immediately shipped--thanks, Amazon Prime! Then I contacted iRULU customer support to give them a heads up about exactly WHY I returned the first one. And that's when I found out about the Windows 10 problem. The device just isn't stable with 10 installed. The rep assured me that it would run flawlessly with 8.1, and suggested I give the replacement a go with that. He was very helpful and friendly in his correspondence. We messaged several times over the course of a day, and everything that he offered was valuable advice.\n\nI cannot thank that nice man enough. Yes, indeed, the device works GREAT with Windows 8.1. I've installed a glass screen protector,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/IRULU-Tempered-Glass-Screen-Protector-for-IRULU-Walknbook-10-1-34-2-in-1-Convertible-Laptop/dp/B00U8KD6KS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">IRULU Tempered Glass Screen Protector for IRULU Walknbook - 10.1\" 2 in 1 Convertible Laptop</a>, and I have a 128GB micro SD card ordered. The iRULU is now handling my work flawlessly, and it stays connected as it should.\n\nI'm not a heavy gamer, and I don't plan to use memory hog apps and programs on this device. What I can do is run Office and stream Netflix movies, and that's all I ever wanted. Bluetooth works great with my 2.1 stereo speakers. Display is bright, and colors are accurate.\n\nI'm very happy with my iRULU WalknBook. Great little tablet and a real bargain!"}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "I have only had this product for two week. At first I really liked it. I downloaded the kindle reading app - which works great. I have had some problems with Windows where it kicks me out of the Network and I can't use anything on the device. Twice today I have hit the power button to \"wake up\" the device, which then prompts me to put in my password. Once I do that, the little icon spins and spins and spins and spins and it says \"Locked\" and \"Welcome\" at the same time. I cannot get the tablet to do anything for at least 20 minutes where it then seems to reset and require the password again.\nAnother issue I have found is there are tiny scratches on my screen. First I thought they were smudge marks but then have realized that the keys on the keyboard are scratching the screen when it is closed. I find this ridiculous since it is designed to be closed that way.\nI am writing this review because I was promised a \"No Hassle Return\" if I did. Yes this product wasn't that expensive, but it is too much to give me this many problem. I plan on returning it - and also the extra case and screen protectors I ordered after I found the scratches."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "I have had the iRULU Walknbook for about 3 weeks now and have run it through its paces.  I immediately updated it to Windows 10, and so this review is based on how the unit runs on the W-10 platform.  (short version, I would recommend NOT updating to W-10 for a while)\n\nOverview:  FOR THE PRICE, this is an amazing little machine.  The fact that you can have a full version of windows in a small package (including office!) is really cool.  You can tuck this into your suitcase and have anything you need at a moments notice in a package that is a fine stand-in for your home or office computer. However, if you are buying primarily for a tablet, there may be better options.  This is a tablet PC in the truest sense: Not the ideal tablet, or the ideal PC, but a lot of great stuff from both.\n\n1). Construction is solid!  The screen protector it comes with was not installed well on mine and I had to remove it and get a new one.  TIP: Don't take off the BACK screen protector!  The back is glass as well, and If you're a little OCD like me, you will obsess over the fingerprints on the back after you use it in tablet mode.\n\n2). It's FAST.  Bootup is under a minute.  The processing speeds are great for any media operations.  I have already edited video and audio files on this and it has never hesitated.  Google Earth runs without hesitation or slowdown, even with rapid zooming.  I do not play PC games, so I have no information on the speeds there.  TIP:  Buying a SD memory expansion IS A MUST.  The OS takes up the majority of memory and if you keep a lot of media files like I do, it's best to get a SD card to expand the memory and also for easy transfer between machines in the event of a failure.\n\n3). Tablet mode is clunky.  Remember, I'm on W-10!  I'm hoping this is a software bug that will be fixed at some point through the windows update process, but switching between tablet and PC mode is kind of a nightmare.  In order to get the iRULU Walknbook to switch, it is necessary to go to the settings, change a setting and restart.  When you have it set as a tablet, it works fine, but to have to go through all that is extremely frustrating.  The magnetized docking mechanism on the keyboard is simply awesome. It guides itself right into position.\n\n4). The keyboard, although small, is fully functional.  One major disappointment with it is this:  While typing, my thumb often hits the track pad, which causes the cursor to go all over the page.  I have been trying to train myself to tuck my thumb under, but a better option would be a way to turn off the track pad (especially since I have a mouse I use).  I do not have unusually large hands, but I am male, with male-sized hands.  The case and stand is part of the keyboard and although I can see a future where the faux-suede case get's dirty and will be hard to clean, it is functionally really cool.\n\n5). There is only one USB port.  This is not a shortcoming, it's a tablet after all!  so if you use a mouse, get a bluetooth mouse so that your one usb port is free for flash drives and such.\n\nWrap Up:  I bought this for under 200 bucks and for my trouble got a fully functional windows tablet that suits all my needs.  Some little design issues are a little annoying, primarily the keyboard design that doesn't allow you to turn off the track pad.  I would strongly recommend that if you get this tablet PC, you stick with Windows 8 for a while.  Your upgrade isn't going anywhere, so wait until function catches up with flash.  If you do switch, don't delete your old OS so you can switch back if the functionality is not to your liking. All in all, I'm happy with my purchase and will hopefully be using this little fella for many years to come!\n\nOh!  The battery life seems to be great too!\n\nUpdate: after a year and a half of minimal use, the battery is shot. I haven't looked into replacing it, but it's definitely a downer."}

Here are the Cons gets a little warm when charging or using for extended period of time. The battery doesn't last as long as I would like seems to be about 5-6 hours although I have never ran it all the way down so it could be more. The keyboard is just okay. It will detach from the tablet easily so you have to have it on a flat surface to keep it attached. It is a little heavy if you are laying down and holding up to read from.\nI have found it to be a very good value and would recommend it  I had one issue and contacted iRULU and they were ready to take it back and send me another but there was no need to do that as it turned out."}

The main reason I got it was to have a 'main room' tablet to check email, surf the web, etc, but when trying to respond to emails or write in documents, the cursor would sometimes bounce around and you would end up typing on a different line.  It became too frustrating to deal with.  If it weren't for the skittish keyboard / trackpad, I may have kept it.\n\nThe tablet did run quite slow, but that's to be expected for a budget tablet.  The colors on the screen also weren't very vivid.  I like looking at photos and the colors just seemed a little dull on this one.  Still an okay screen for a budget 2-in-1 though.  All these drawbacks may be okay if you are looking for something like this for a decent price and don't plan to rely on the keyboard too much, but the bad could not outweigh the good for me on this one."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "I bought the IRULU Walknbook 10.1 inch hybrid laptop/tablet to replace an 8\" Windows tablet made by a major computer retailer/brand... I loved my previous tablet, but after some issues and the other company not honoring the warranty -- it was time to move on, and the IRULU just drew me in like a flashing neon light! I had to check it out! I'm sure glad that I did, too! It's a little bigger than my previous tablet, but not so big that I feel like I'm carrying a huge laptop. It feels very sturdy and well-made...and it functions just as well as any major brand name you can buy right now -- but maybe a little better for the price! A few of the things I really love about this product??\n\n* Standard USB port -- I can FINALLY use a thumb drive or mouse or any other USB peripheral needed without an adapter! There's still the Micro USB, should you have a need for it -- but so far the standard USB has proven to be a huge plus! THANK YOU IRULU for hearing the cries of so many tablet users and putting this on the Walknbook!\n\n* The keyboard/case -- This is the genius behind this product. It's so much like another name brand tablet with detachable keyboard that it's unreal...but it's much more affordable compared to that product. The case features a keyboard (that's quite comfortable for typing) complete with trackpad mouse...and it doesn't require a separate charge or additional batteries....it's powered from the laptop/tablet device. It's attached to the case, and the case also has the folding magnetic portion that creates a stand. It does feel a bit flimsy, but don't let it fool you -- it's quite sturdy! I'm loving the case!\n\n* Expandable storage -- While 32 GB on the SSD seems like a good bit, after you take the OS installation's footprint into consideration along with any apps you might add; things get a bit tight on the on-board storage. While a larger SSD would be nice, 32 G was enough for me to get started. I slipped a 64 GB Micro SD into the slot and now have plenty of room for my day-to-day uses.\n\n* The Screen -- It's VERY bright and has vibrant color! The IPS touchscreen is great -- very responsive to touch when you're using it as a tablet. Also the \"Start\" button at the bottom of the screen / below the screen is a welcome addition...one less actual button on the side or top to remember or confuse with say...the power button!\n\n* Mini HDMI out -- While I won't use this a lot, I'll probably find myself still using it more than I originally though. With the Mini HDMI out, I'm able to connect the device to a host of external video sources. TVs, projectors, larger monitors, etc... This has already proven to be useful for me at a recent presentation for a client. The conference room PC wasn't working, so I grabbed my presentation off the cloud and loaded it in PowerPoint -- and Voila!\n\nThe Walknbook has really impressed me in many ways. The Intel BayTrail-T Quad Core Processor is quite fast for that breed of Atom processor and it seems to handle most tasks with ease. I've only seen it \"panic\" a few times, and I admit I was pushing the envelope on purpose to take it through its paces.  After adding the Micro SD card, I decided to upgrade the device to Windows 10...had NO ISSUES at all! It went quite smoothly compared to some other Windows devices I've upgraded of late.\n\nThe ONLY thing I wish was different was the DC charger port. While I know this is more of a hybrid laptop rather than a tablet -- it's still very much a tablet in size.  I wish IRULU would've considered using Micro USB or something more common for the DC charging port. The small coaxial-type plug works fine, and extra chargers are readily available and very affordable on Amazon and other online sources, it's just a process to remember having a charger with you at all times or at every location. Most anywhere I go I can find a Micro USB (or even USB Mini \"B\"), but the proprietary-ish charger limits me. Thankfully I understand electronics well-enough that I could scoot into most any electronics store and find a universal adapter and charger to get me back up and running if needed, but I've purchased a few extras from IRULU on Amazon just to cover all the bases (home, work, spare for the car, etc.).\n\nOverall I'm VERY impressed with this device and hope to get a lot of great use out of it! I highly recommend it for the power and value!"}

However, it appears that it had had a screen protector applied (before I got it) and there were bubbles underneath the glass. I do not know if this was a factory applied screen or if this was a re manufactured device (I ordered a new device). But in any case it was unacceptable and I am returning it for another IRULU. We will see what the second one looks like. I'll update after I get it.\n\n*******UPDATE***************UPDATE***************UPDATE***************UPDATE********\n\nOverall the iRULU WalknBook is very useful. Note that this is not full-on a laptop. It is a 10.1 inch Windows tablet computer. For mobile light computing it is well fitted and does its job mostly well. I wouldnt try running Adobe Photoshop on this machine but nobody should. Its not meant for that. For general office work and computing this machine is well outfitted and performs great.\nWhile the WalknBook doesnt do anything spectacularly it does quite a lot really well. I guess you could say that if it did one thing spectacularly that would be delivering a heck of a value in a Windows Tablet for 200 bucks. Including a cover, keyboard and pointer pad. Thats cheaper than a lot of Android Tabs.\n\nPros:\n- Display is good\n- Processing speed is completely adequate for general office use (Word, Excel, Chrome, etc)\n- Other than the display glass issue the device is well made and quite solid\n- The included keyboard and cover are pretty good and are well integrated with the device\n- It runs Windows and Windows apps perfectly. No compatibility issues\n- It has great interfaces including USB A and B ports. (I think it is USB 3.0 but Im not sure) Its shown as 3.0 in Device Mgr but it is not labelled SS (Super Speed) on the actual port. Also it has mini HDMI!, 128G SD slot, and headphones port. Thats pretty good for a small machine. Especially the mini HDMI.\n- Its got a front and rear camera but I have not tried them. Im sure they work fine\n- Its kind of fun to have such a small Windows computer\n\nCons:\n- The device and the charger get pretty hot when in use\n- It never charges above 98%\n- It seems to take a long time to charge. Especially when you are using it while charging it\n- Sometimes the device seems to stall. For instance Chrome will become glacially slow for a period of time (perhaps a minute or so) then start behaving normally.\n- Norton found 3 viruses on its initial scan after installation. Norton was installed immediately after booting and completing configuration of the Windows OS. Norton was able to eradicate the viruses but it was still surprising that they were there. (on a new machine)\n\nOverall I am happy with the WalknBook"}

The screen is pretty good quality with nice viewing angles, and the performance is acceptable for what we need it for. The battery life is pretty good, but it does use a barrel charging cable instead of USB (would be a nice thing if it could charge on the USB cable, but I'm too afraid to plug it into a cell phone charger to try it!). I'm actually so impressed with the device that I ordered one for me as well (this time in orange so we can tell them apart at a glance).\nThe Bad: The keyboard is a little small for my gorilla hands, but my wife doesn't seem to have any issues with it. Minor nit-pick really.\nThe Ugly: the backing was slightly delaminated, and was causing a slight color imperfection in the top right corner of the display, but thanks to Irulu's excellent warranty policy, it is possible to get it fixed quite easily.\nOverall: Thanks for an excellent product, and I would recommend this tablet to everyone who wants a low powered tablet for reading or playing light games, but also needs to occasionally use Microsoft office."}

I recently purchased this product, about 2 weeks ago, after my laptop that I had been using for school broke down on me 2 days before my final for a summer class. I decided to start looking for a 2 in 1 laptops because I wanted something that I could write notes in while I read online textbooks for my classes. Also I wanted something that was light weight, with a decent battery life, and that was easy to use, so while searching for all these I came across the iRULU and instantly fell in love with it. One of the reasons I fell in love with it was that it came in different colors, which most other laptops typically don't come in, and when I saw the color, the price, and that it had a decent battery life, and that it included a free year subscription of Microsoft Office 365 I was sold. Once I to got the laptop the setup  was extremely easy and learning how to use it as well, so far I've used it to take notes on, read books, and watch movies and have found it to be very responsive with everything I do, but when a page freezes and one switches it off after a about a minute of waiting one can turn it on again, and it works perfectly well without a problem."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "I really love this 2 in one PC/Tablet. It's small for a PC but big for a tablet, thin but a bit heavier than a standard tablet and convenient. I can do so much on it and it's so much easier than a laptop to carry around. I am not a computer genius so I'm sure there are many features I have missed on this thing but what I have used I love. I originally purchased the orange one and it froze within a couple of weeks, and although I was able to restore it and get it working I was afraid it would freeze again so I returned it and purchased this one because I loved it so much I didn't want to give it back. The company was amazingly understanding and paid for me to return it without any problems. The keyboard/case it came with is very flimsy (I knew this at time of purchase, and planned on purchasing a wireless one) and to me useless but that is such a small deal and easy to replace that it's not a reason to not purchase this item. I purchased a wireless mouse, keyboard and speaker and the bluetooth took a little time to connect at first (aprox 20 min) but now it has no problems connection quickly at all. Netfilx streams very well on this and looks great. I would highly recommend purchasing this item."}

I just updated it to window 10 with no issues other than it takes a while for it to complete but that is true of all windows upgrades.  What I like is this is a fully capable PC which gives you a ton of flexibility over Android (yes I have several).  It is as fast as you could expect for the price even faster than I expected.  If you change the windows setting to performance you can even improve upon what it normally would be.  The brightness of the screen is very good although the fonts were a little smaller than I like until I made them larger, again this goes to it being a full version of Windows which gives you the flexibility.  It automatically found and installed my printer (try doing that with Android). It found the other computers on my home network and I am able to share files and access the shared files on the network.  The keyboard works well but a little small for my big hands so I use a Bluetooth keyboard which hand no problem installing because it was automatically done when I plugged the Bluetooth keyboard receiver in.  I also connected to some Bluetooth speakers with no problem. I have played Netflix movies with no problems and with Chromecast I can have it play on the TV and still use the tablet to work while I watch TV.  It is very sturdy a tab heavier than Android tablet. It gets a little warm when charging or when it is processing a lot of data but not overly warm.  My only complaint is I don't see the amount of apps you have with android.  So far there is only one app 0Android has that I don't see available but I was able to create a bat file and get it done just not as pretty but it works.\n\nAll in all I would say if you like the windows OS and the way they do things then you will like this little tablet."}

It really does seem to run like a laptop or tablet, whichever your need may be.  I haven't used Microsoft Office yet, but downloading it went fine.  I also played videos off of YouTube and there was no trouble with that.  My old laptop has Windows 7, so Windows 8 takes some getting used to.  I haven't used it a ton since getting it, but the tablet itself does get warm while using it.  The charger itself also gets hot when it's charging, so I wouldn't necessarily let it charge at night while you're asleep or if you aren't home.  It charges fairly quickly though which is nice.  It is also built pretty sturdy which is a huge plus.  I was hesitant to get it because it's not from a well known company, but I looked the company up and liked them.  Between that, the reviews on here and the fact it runs a full version of Windows, it sold me and I'm still happy with it.  I would recommend giving it a try."}

It loses track constantly and randomly clicks things, so I would recommend an external mouse if you are going to use a mouse at all. It's a bit slow, but with 2gb of ram it was expected. Still performs adequately. Worth the money? Absolutely. You cannot beat the performance to price, this thing really is a steal. Loading up chrome and browsing the web is pretty buttery, so I am very happy about that. I really just wanted a mobile device that could run Microsoft Access, which this does just fine. Don't expect amazing performance with these specs, but it will get the job done if you are willing to be patient.\n\nAs for how long it will last I will update if anything starts going wrong."}

I've used the original iPad, the Google Nexus 7 Android tablet, netbooks, and laptops of all sizes.\n\nLet me say that having the iRulu tablet for travel is perfect for me. I don't just surf the web and do email. I have to be productive with MS Word, PowerPoint, and Excel when I travel. The iRulu with the free subscription to Office 365 makes that all very possible and easy. The tablet is very responsive, and you can use Windows 8.1 in traditional Windows desktop mode if you don't like all those touchy icons and charms on your desktop. I also bought an Anker bluetooth keyboard for maximum productivity; the detachable iRulu keyboard's keys were just too small for my typical work.\n\nThe only drawback for me is the iRulu keyboard. It's just too small for me, a 100% touch typist who can go 100 words per minute, to be productive. The keys are just too close together for me to type as quickly as I like. The MOST significant drawback of this keyboard is the placement and tiny size of the Shift key. It's simply not possible to use this Shift key to capitalize letters when typing normally. It was annoying enough that I purchased a wireless keyboard (and mouse) from Anker which is only SLIGHTLY larger than the iRulu keyboard (one inche longer) but has a giant Shift key at the normal position. I'm using the Anker keyboard and mouse right now. They were a cinch to hook up through the USB port on the iRulu. So I'm a very happy camper."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "I just got the new irulu tablet and it's pretty good so far. The keyboard is a little flexible which is concerning and the screen does have bubbles like I'd read in an email. However upon closer look I'm pretty sure that there's another screen protector because you can tell there's an extra layer when looking at the camera. Either way the resolution is much better than I'd originally expected though. It does come with only 23 gigs of memory though, not 32. The wifi connection works great and it does feel pretty solid despite being pretty light. The protection cover, although creative doesn't feel like it's top quality and might break soon but the keyboard part of it clips on perfectly with not even the slightest issue. On the added note though, I found out that the reason why there are so many reviews is because irulu extends your warranty if you post a review which is great. However if the product was bad people could still change their reviews as I will if anything ends up going wrong soon. Overall the best bang for your buck I have seen. Only minor issue I have right now is that I can't open OneNote but I expect it will probably get fixed once the Windows updates start rolling in."}

The speed and response of the tablet has been better than expected in comparison to the android products that I have used.  The price is a bargain in comparison to other products of a similar type.  That being said I do have a couple of concerns.  The first is probably just a purchase timing irritation.  I purchased the tablet for around $250.00.  It was a non prime item but came with free shipping.  Just a few weeks after I received the tablet it was advertised for $25.00 less and became a Prime item.  I contacted Amazon about a price guarantee but they said that there was nothing that they could do.\n\nThe more important issue that I have has to do with a problem that has recently developed.  Occasionally in the last couple of months after the tablet has been turned off it has trouble powering up.  I press the power button for different periods ranging from one to ten seconds and get not response.  I then waited for a couple of minutes and try again and finally the tablet comes on.  I will have to wait and see if the problem persist or gets worse.\n\nUpdate:\nThe tablet did get to the point where it would not power on.  I tried several times to do the hard reboot as suggested by the IRULU representative.  The instructions that I received in the email stated to hold down the power button and volume button for about 12 seconds.  This did not work for me.\n\nIRULU was very cooperative and replaced the tablet even though I was 2 days outside of the 90-day worry-free warranty period.  The replacement tablet arrived within a week after I had returned the original tablet."}

I seems to occur when auto connect is off, for the selected WIFI hot spot (my router). Today, I was trying one last test, and after watching movies for about 2.5 hours, from 100% full charge, I accidentally disconnected the keyboard. When I , reconnected it, the screen went dark, but I still had sound. I tried the Windows key, Enter, ESC, etc, but no display. I finally used the power button to turn it off. Then, it would not turn on. I tried pushing the power button for various lengths of time, with no success. I also tried pushing the left volume button at the same time as the power button. Nothing, I then plugged in the charger, and still no luck. I decided to let it charge, for awhile, per a suggestion on Amazon. It was only on for 2.5 hours, so should have been still around 30-40%. After about 20 minutes, I tried the power button, and there was a faint display, for about 1 second, then nothing. I tried the power button again, and it came up saying slide screen down to turn off. The display was blinking on an off at about a 1 second rate. I hit CR to see if it would go back to Windows, but it shut down. ted power + left volume, and it started and went to the Windows login screen. The screen was still blinking, on and off. I logged on, and the blinking finally stopped. I then decided to respond to your last email. Since the power problem, the keyboard has been acting strange, making typing this very awkward. The cursor will jump anywhere from 8-20 characters back on the line, or up to previous lines. Some times, it enters multiple CR, when I do not even hit the Enter key. I even tried typing with 2 fingers, to make sure I hit the correct keys, and it still does it.\nThe charger still gets warmer than I feel is proper, while the tablet is charging. When fully charged, it cools down.\nGiven the additional power problem, screen flashing, and now erratic keyboard problem, I would like to return the tablet for a refund.\n\nUpdate: July 29, 2015. I got a comment from Irulu, stating \"Sorry to hear that, Please feel free to contact us (email address) or phone number. and we will offer the driver as soon.\". Since I have made reference to 2 drivers, so far, I have no idea which driver they are referring to. The email address is different from the others I have used so far.  I also got an email, stating they had fixed their password problems, on their website, though I have not verified it yet. Still no confirmation that my warranty got registered. The WIFI problem is erratic and seems to be related to using battery and not having Auto Connect on in the WIFI menu. I need to do some more testing before I try the phone number they gave me. So far, not impressed with their comments/response, as to the tablet problems.\nUpdate: July 25, 2015. I could not register my warranty, because I forgot my irulu.com account password, and their password reset program, on their website, would not accept new passwords. Finally created a new account, with another email, and got the warranty registered, though I have no confirmation yet. I sent them an email about this, the power supply overheating, and WIFI failing, consistently by having to reload the driver, or power off/on so that the Device Manager would even see the hardware. Others seem to be having quite good response, from Irulu, with their problems, but so far, I am not having much luck at all. I will continue to update this, depending upon what support I get.\n\nI was hesitant to order, due to the low price and unknown manufacturer, though the few early on reviews were quite good.\nDecided to take a chance, and order it. As it turns out, for the most part, I was pleasantly surprised. There have been some\nquite detailed reviews, which cover most of the features, so I will try to summarize and concentrate on the areas that are\naffecting me.\n1. Screen and resolution: I wanted 1920, but considering the price and the density, on a 10\" screen, I am happy with\n  the 1280. 1920 would be awfully small to try to use touch, especially on programs, I have written\n  in C#, which do no scale the display. The screen is quite bright, and I can turn it all the way\n  down to watch movies, and extend battery life.\n2. Ports: It has all the ports, one could ask for, except that it would have been nice if the USB was 3.0. The full size\n  2.0 port is nice, though.\n3. Build: The tablet seems to be very well built, and feels quite solid.\n4. Internal Storage: The 32G is border line, but I added a 64G memory card, which helps. The only drawback, is that some programs\n  cannot be installed on a removable drive/memory. This is not the fault of the tablet.\n5. Memory: Everyone says 2G is restrictive, but I have 2G on my netbook and two desktops, and this seems to perform, just as well\n  as those. I can open multiple tabs, in a browser, without any problems. I also run Visual Studio to compile and run\n  large C# programs, and it handles that just fine. I would have liked, to have had at least 4G, but for the price, it is\n  very satisfactory.\n6. Power switch: The power switch takes a good push to activate, which I like. I have tried another smaller tablet, and I was\n  always accidentally turning off the power.\n7. The keyboard and cover: The keyboard is fairly good, except that the keys are small and hard to hit properly. The magnetic\n  connector just pulls the tablet in and makes attaching very simple. It seems to make a solid, strong\n  connection, in all but one case. When you use it on your lap, and the back cover leans back too far,\n  the tablet will start to disconnect from the connector pins, due to the backward torque of the tablet.\n  The tablet will intermittently disconnect then reconnect, but it never has had any effect on the programs,\n  being run, or the computer in general, so it is not really an issue. I put it on a cutting board, which\n  I put on my lap, and that works just fine.\n  I have not taken any of the screen protection off yet, and it is getting scratches from the keyboard.\n  I am going to try to put some small silicone feet, around the keyboard, to keep it away from the screen,\n  when the cover is closed.\n8. Bluetooth: The Bluetooth signal is excellent. I can drive a Bluetooth speaker, up to 40 feet away, from downstairs, through\n  walls, to the upstairs.\n\nOver all, some of the above items could have been better, but for the price, they are more than adequate.\n\nI do have some areas that I do not like, and one that may cause me to return the unit.\n\n1. The speakers are not very loud. I have to use headphones, when watching movies, even in a quite room. Front facing speakers\n  probably would have helped. Not a deal breaker. I bought a small Bluetooth speaker which works fine.\n2. The power block gets extremely hot, when the tablet is charging. Almost too hot to touch. I am going to see if IRULU will\n  replace this. I do not trust leaving it charging and unattended. The power cable is short and has a sort of unique male\n  plug, but I found all the adapters, on Amazon, that I needed to make it more practical.\n3. WIFI adapter: This is what has given me the biggest problem. After watching movies for an hour or so, the internet connection\n  will become limited or lost. All other WIFI signals, typically around 8-10, will have vanished from the network display.\n  If my network shows limited, disconnecting will make it vanish too. Occasionally, the adapter will also vanish from the\n  Device Manager, which requires a power cycle to bring it back. At other times, when it is still visible in the Device Manager,\n  I can disable/enable it, and the networks will show up again, or I have to uninstall the driver and reinstall it, to get the\n  networks to display again. I thought the return period was 90 days, from Amazon, but when I went to return it, found out it is\n  only 30 days. Before I got this far, I started to remove all my data and programs from the tablet, before returning it. During\n  this process, the tablet stopped working and would not start windows. It went into a troubleshooting mode. I tried the fix mode,\n  and it still would not start. I finally did a reset, to completely restore it to the original MFG state. After completely setting\n  up Windows, again, I tried watching some movies, and sure enough, the network adapter lost all the signals again. This sort of\n  ruled out any software I might have added. I am going to submit this review to IRULU, and see what they can do. I will update\n  the review after I see what the results are. This is a deal breaker, because, you have to stop everything and either disable/enable\n  the adapter, uninstall/install the driver, or completely power off/on, the tablet, to even see the adapter to change its settings.\n  This has happened every day for a week now.\n4. Sound card: This seems to be a driver problem. After I reset the tablet to MFG state, I had no sound. I tried every troubleshooting\n  procedure, I could find, but could not get any sound. I then ran Windows update, and had it load 60 updates. After that, the sound\n  started to work. I do have one of the first tablets that were sold.\n\nWith the exception of the Network adapter and power supply, I believe this is the best buy, at this time, for a 10\" Windows tablet.\nBeing able to run all my previous Windows programs, is just icing on the cake.\n\nThe 3 star rating, is due mainly to the network adapter problem and the overheating power block. I will update my review and rating\nafter I contact IRULU and see what they can do to remedy the problems."}

That means for the last 2 weeks this WalknBook  is my only computer is and it's filled in seamlessly. My biggest issue is my own fingers which when typing (I am not a touch typist) often tap the screen causing the cursor to move but that's my fault.  I have edited several papers and attached them as files to send off, I have downloaded movies to watch at a later date, I have uploaded photos to FB and have listened to some music with and without headphones.  I have nothing but praise for the speed and versatility of this tablet with keyboard.  It all works well together and apart. If you use it on your lap with the keyboard you will need something sturdy so the keyboard stays attached. I have decided this will be my traveling companion instead of my laptop, smaller, lighter, less bulky and just as useful. I installed a class 10 64GB micro SD card and which is where I have stored and watched my movies and listened to downloaded music. Now my wife is going to purchase one!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "So I've been using this tablet consistently for about 2 months now, and I think it really is a great product, especially at its price point. I mainly use it for surfing and playing older generation games, with occasional productivity work. The convenience of the form factor is great. I was able to stick a fast 64G SD card into the machine, and that was more than sufficient for offloading large media and static download files.\n\nPROS:\n - works great, nice touchscreen feel\n - crisp display\n - the 2GB RAM really helps keep it running at a snappy and responsive pace\n - even with extended gaming (older generation games), the tablet still runs at a moderate temperature, not too hot. And battery life is decent; I'm getting around 4-5 hours of continuous use.\n\nCONS:\n - the power connector is a custom connector.  I really wish they used a more standard micro-usb port for charging instead.\n\nThe keyboard cover is good. It's usable on a table surface, and works ok. Not as good as the Microsoft Surface keyboard cover, but it is decent and gets the job done.\n\nI have to add that the first keyboard cover I got was buggy/broken. Keys either didn't register or were sticky (unexpected and uncontrolled key-repeats) and the trackpad was uselessly inaccurate. I contacted iRULU support, and they were super helpful. They sent me a fresh replacement cover, at no charge, and the new one works great."}

The circle got bigger over the next hour until the screen started flashing (party dance style) and the screen turned off. The tablet was on and the screen registered touch, but it was black. Whenever I turned it back on, it would work for about a minute before the flashing party stated again.\n\nI returned this product the next day."}

If I didn't have the mouse & keyboard readily available I wouldn't have been able to do anything.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "I was researching lots of \"2 in 1\", I wanted something that I could use as a laptop or a tablet. I was not interested in the folding laptops, i really wanted something I could separate the screen from the mouse. I was not prepared to spend $500 plus on the Surface 3, or equal on many of the other options. I then came across the IRULU Walknbook here on Amazon. It came with a \"docked\" style keyboard, 2 GB of ram, and a decent screen. For the price and better in my book than the ASUS or Acer options. I love it!, This device has no \"bloatware\" or \"third party\" software that takes away from the limited memory. I had 16 GB free after set up and updates. I added my Office 365 Applications, now I am down to 12 GB free.  I have a 64 GB micro SD card in it, and have routed all my folders to it. It is not the fastest, or the best screen, but really, its a windows Tablet and Laptop for less than $200 bucks. I don't expect to edit video files or create games on it, I just wanted something to browse the internet and edit business documents on the go. I don't have a single bit of buyers remorse! Thanks IRULU!"}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "After using the Walknbook 10.1 Windows tablet for over a month I remain satisfied with my purchase.  The only problem I had was the keyboard, which had a spacebar that was defective.  After a call to IRULU a replacement keyboard was sent immediately.  The replacement keyboard was easier to use than the original primarily because the keys were larger and the right shift key was both bigger and better positioned.\n\nLoading software and apps went smoothly.  After installing many apps as well as Panda (virus software) Firefox, Calibre, Open Office (instead of Microsoft Office 365, which is free for only one year) there is still about 15 Gigs of storage left of the 32 Gigs of flash memory that comes with the tablet.  If you purchase the tablet you should buy an inexpensive stylus that would make the use of the touch screen, which works very well, even more enjoyable.  You will also need to purchase a micro SD card for extra storage.  In deciding how large of an SD card to purchase (mine is 32 Gigs) it is important to realize that Windows 8.1 does not allow you to download apps to the SD card like it does on a Windows phone but only to the main memory of the tablet.  This is deliberate design decision by Microsoft, which will ultimately limit the number of apps you can download regardless of the size of your SD card.  It is possible that Microsoft will rectify this problem when it releases Windows 10.  Hopefully, the Walknbook will be able to run the Windows 10 upgrade but that remains to be seen.\n\nThe tablet starts up very quickly and is running in seconds after being turned on, which is a pleasant difference from most computers.  The screen display including its clarity, contrast and color are all excellent.  As others have noted the tablet does get warm on the left side when in use but it has not gotten uncomfortably hot.  The long-term reliability of the product remains an open question but for about $200 it is a worthwhile purchase and fills a need for a portable device that runs the same Windows software used on most desktop computers."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "it is OK for $200,  at $400 it would be a complete rip off there are much much better made and higher spec windows tablet devices in the $400 range.  Not even close.\n\nFor $200 you get a somewhat hot running tablet, that sports a rather poorly sensitive  screen.  The Keyboard is very cheap, flexes when typing and suffers from some bad ADHD  (it that it cant stay focused for more than a few minutes.)  The keyboard and tablet combo completely fail to be useful because while typing focus jumps from one box to another. Same thing happened to other using the machine so it is not my typing style.\n\nWe got this because it is cheap and we would not have to worry about it getting stolen while we travel.  It serves that gap nicely.  But this is not a primary device in any way shape or form,  it makes a good surfing tool , but really requires you to sit at a table to type, there is no way to use this on your lap without it falling over and focus jumping around.\n\nThe magnetic connection with the keyboard is very weak and breaks with the slightest movement,  where as most two in ones have much better mag connections that require force or a trick to disconnect...\n\noverall if you need a short term , cheap device this is OK,  if you want something to last 1 or 2 years, I suggest finding something else."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "I usually base my purchases from Amazon on customer reviews. Now that I am living in Hawaii and selection is often limited, I am buy more and more stuff online, such as laptops that I have never heard of before (e.g. IRULU). While the Walknbook is light, convenient, quick and easy to use it takes some getting used to. I have almost dropped the laptop twice because it feels like it is securely attached to the keyboard --- it is not. Be careful if you want to pick up and move the laptop while it is \"open.\" Be careful also charging in the \"closed\" position, the laptop gets pretty hot. The adapter also gets hot when charging. If the Walknbook completely runs out of juice, it takes some time to turn on even after it is plugged in while it regains some of its charge --- this almost gave me a heart attack on several occasions because I thought it had died with all of my document. I loved that it interfaced with my main laptop in seconds with the same settings and saved bookmarks, passwords, etc. Technology makes life so much easier when it works. I have yet to stream movies or do anything more intensive with this little book, but everything else has been surprisingly fast, so I have high hopes."}

My touchscreen doesn't just stop working at random times anymore and the apps don't lag out like they would sometimes. Windows 10 seems to be perfect for this tablet.  Only problem I really have is that cortana will just turn on at random times for no reason. I will be surfing the web and all of a sudden cortana will just pop up like I said Hey Cortana.  also I bought a different case for like 10 bucks and I use a little blutooth keyboard that I had from a previous tablet. and I hook up a wireless mouse. works much better.\n\nthis review is going to be kinda long sorry. I've had this tablet for a little over a month now. I felt like a month would be an appropriate amount of time to write a more accurate review. I love a lot of things about this tablet but other things about it are less than desirable.  first the price, for what you are getting the price is fantastic, I didn't feel like I was being overcharged.  Next it comes with a case/keyboard no need to go buy one and the keyboard has raised keys so there is some feedback while you are typing unlike the surface keyboard where it feels like you are just moving your fingers on the table.  but the keys are pretty small and the right shift key is even smaller so if you had a lot of typing to do and you don't have access to a regular computer I would recommend just using a cheap USB keyboard and plugging it in.  also I have noticed that if I not paying attention and try to type at normal speed the first letter of every word just gets left out. like I hit it to fast for it to register or something.  also I love the usb slot and the hdmi slot. As far as performance I have noticed a few things but nothing so bad that I had using it. For netflix and youtube and watching your own movies fantastic. It does play some steam games.  I didn't buy it to play games but I just wanted to test it out.  It will play older games and low end games like vvvvvv, ff7, ff8, castle crashers, things to that extent.  I did try League of Legends on it and it ran for ok at low settings for about 10 minutes then the fps dropped to like 3 and I couldn't get it back up even after changing it to very low. although it does work pretty well for streaming your steam games, which is where the usb slot and hdmi cable come in handy just turn on streaming and hook it up to your tv, hook up your controller and it works pretty well. a little lag here or there but nothing to rage over.  now some things i don't like about it. the storage space it says 32 but it's really only 23 and after you get your basic stuff on there it's even less. but you can upgrade the storage with a micro sd card you just have to shell out a little extra money cause your going to want a good one. you could us an external hard drive but that takes up your usb slot and who wants to have to carry that around with them all the time and plug it in every time you try to use it. also it does not like to be left on for days at a time. like other regular tablets or phones that people just leave on for days and only turn off when the power dies. this guy does not like that. you have to treat it like a laptop or desktop and turn it off when its not going to be used for a while. otherwise it starts to do weird things like the touchscreen will stop working or the volume buttons won't respond or it will freeze for a bit. my brother also has one of these and he says his does the same thing.  also i will notice that when i close the case the keyboard will disconnect and reconnect at like random times.  it will just be sitting there and then it will start to make the noise.\nalso it does get pretty hot after using it. on the left side where all of the hook-ups are. so be sure to keep a fan or cooling device of some kind handy when planing on excessive use.  also you will sometimes have to click things twice like they didn't register the first time. other than that its a pretty good tablet. I prefer to disconnect from the keyboard and just use the touchscreen if i don't have to do a lot of typing and am just surfing the internet or Facebook. sorry my review is so long but i just wanted to let people who were serious about buying this know how it's worked for me so far. favorite price was the price for what you are getting. a full windows version not rt or some crap like that.  can't wait to see what it will be like when the windows 10 update comes out."}

I'm a bit of a curmudgeon and I expect to have negative experiences with situations like this.

They have the worst service i have ever come across and im in the IT world and deal with a lot of hardware companies. The Tablet itself is fine and works quite well but if you are thinking of doing a clean install and removing everything irulu put on this device good luck. Irulu cannot supply you any drivers for this device and the hardware is not native to Windows 8 or 8.1. Im sure irulu do not make this device and its only rebadged. In fact i has since found Quantum View have a tablet which looks  the same but with no orange strips on it. I could go on and on but why bother. DONT buy IRULU if you want good service. Buy an ASUS i clean installed their tablet with win8.1 Enterprise and downloaded the drivers from them. Up and Running in 30 Minutes. What more can i say. Buy an ASUS. Do yourself a favor."}

This event should send tremors down the small platform builders backs.\n\nUntil now, only elite small platform machines could handle the power of Windows (which gave rise to handhelds with funny named Android versions etc).  Whats in play is the ability to move between the desktop-laptop-handtop workspace/playspace with No change in interface or user experience. What other operating system can claim this seamless experience - Android on a desktop? iOS is different on their desktop, Chrome OS on a desktop?\n\nAnyway, when the tablet arrived, I was very apprehensive so I had several adults try their hand on it to give me the added assurance to use this as my work machine on a trip. It passed every user test for speed, comfort, and feature availability. And with those successes, my venture of having the Irulu float to the top of my 30 tablet comparison was secured (at the top due mainly because of windows  as I was skeptically curious about a $200 tablet running the full up windows 8.1 (not the reduced technology, RT version).\n\nThe preceding, along with year of office 365, is what makes the Irulu unique. (Yes it has what many other Android tablets have (and more than the iOSs)  Bay Trail (a product of Intels $250Million investment into a new breed of handtop processors), 2 Usb ports, Bluetooth 4, n level Wi-Fi, detachable but integrated keyboard/touchpad/case/stand, easy to spot orange, large capacity SD storage, 10 inch HD multi-touch screen, good battery life, HDMI out I am sure other reviewers have provided extensive feature lists, but those are not really unique to this tablet, but that they are All there do make it very competitive with the pack.)\n\nHaving used the Irulu for a couple of months, I'm happy with the Web access performance, the smoothness of the Windows platform (no mounting etc to fully discover/retrieve/consume the 64GB content from a non-brand name $20 SD card).\nOn travel, I did remote work (Excel/PowerPoint etc) on a corporate site, searched the Internet, and watched Netflix on 8 different Wi-Fi locations (airport/private/hotels/Kiosk) in 10 days (sometimes concurrently playing music on 2 pairs of $13 Bluetooth headphones) with no connectivity or performance issues. While traveling I used a thin DVD USB player (Windows auto-recognized it without the driver disk) and for convenience brought a multi-plug/port AC/DC inverter with extension cord for the car and hotel recharge of several USB devices. Very well equipped for under $275.\n\nThe main drawback comes from the strength of the machine (so no fix here)  Intel processors, even the Bay Trail family, run hot. High frequency multi-cores have to dissipate their heat, and a thin tablet has no fan.\nAlso, the wall power supply, while very small, gets very hot!  This is where Irulu could make a *simple* improvement by upgrading to a cooler power unit with a longer than 4 feet cord.\n\nAlso, if the Irulu company offered an option from the 2 GB RAM to purchase a 4GB plus tablet I would most definitely had made that choice.\nWhen that happens, why buy a laptop? (or an Android/iOS/Chromebook) - a reason for tremors."}

I use external hard drives, and Blu Ray drives, no problem. I just wish I could upgrade the ram to 4 gigs. I also want to add, that while it is eligible for Windows 10 upgrade, you can't do it, because of lack of storage space. Need about 14 gigs for the installer itself, and another 20 gigs for the upgrade. Since its only got 32 to begin with, it can't work.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "Maybe I am technology deficient or Apple inclined but so far my experience with this tablet has not been good.  To clarify here are the issues I am encountering:\n-Connection to the included docking keyboard is very poor, even on a perfectly straight desk it will not stay connected, rendering it useless except for keeping it from being damaged in travel.  This was the main reason for purchase so I could do work on this device when my work laptop dies (as it does very quickly on most trips) and I travel a lot.\n-Certain Apps do not connect well, namely ABC, Amazon and Netflix so far.  Amazon brings up a blank screen, Netflix sits and spins, and ABC won't allow you to verify and goes blank on certain shows.  How I know this is a problem with the device is because they work perfectly on my iPhone.  Kindle also seems to be hit or miss.\nMaybe I just got a lemon but I'm ready to go back to Apple products where there are plenty of Apps available in their store instead of searching for them online, downloading and finding they are not really compatible.  The reviews for this tablet were outstanding and I was hoping  to have the best of both worlds in a tablet/laptop but this has not been the case.  Thinking I've wasted $200 from what I've encountered so far."}

I have TRIED to call them 25 times so far at various times of day and all I hear is the same message: \"Our hours are 0800 to 1100 and 1500 to 2400.\"  That is a blatant lie.\n\nI had to delete a nice long review about how good this tablet was, and how pleased I was with it.  All of that went right out the window.  It automatically updated to Windows 10 and was running it seamlessly.  WAS, being the operative word.  Then, two days ago I had a message saying it was time to install another update.  Now it won't start!  All it does is say it is trying to reinstall a previous version of Windows.\n\nI tried to call their \"customer support\" line at 800-542-1798.  Best of luck getting anybody on that number.  SO, I emailed them.  Nothing but crickets.  These people are the worst at customer support, mainly because there isn't any!  I would have given them zero stars if Amazon would have let me, but one was as low as it goes.  Too bad Irulu goes lower than that!\n\nI have only had this tablet for 6 months; well within the theoretical 1 year warranty.  A lot of good a warranty is when you cannot use it!  If I were you, get out the money you were going to spend on this tablet and shove it right up your... I mean... shove it right down the toilet.  You are essentially flushing it as soon as you get it anyway.  It was a nice tablet, but not for that period of time, and not for this level of customer dissatisfaction.  These clowns will never get another cent of my money and I will see to it, none of the people I know waste their money on any of their sub-par products.  I will also be writing a Better Business Bureau complaint as well for fraud.\n\nHEY IRULU:  DON'T OFFER SOMETHING YOU ARE NOT GOING TO HONOR!  If you would have told me this thing was a piece of **** I would have saved my money and saved my time!  Now I'm out the money I spent on it, and I still need a tablet!\n\nAddition to my last EDIT: 03-08-16\nI FINALLY got an email from iRulu!  They sent me to their crap download site to download the operating system again.  You'll never guess what happens next!!  NOTHING!!!  Abso-fckng-lutely nothing!  It still does the same thing!  I responded to that email to tell them it didn't help and you will never guess what happened!!  NOTHING AGAIN!!!  These people are little more than a fraudulent cover for a money laundering scheme.  Buy anything with the iRulu name on it and I guarantee you will regret it at some time or another."}

This gave me a scare at first that my tablet stopped working out of nowhere, but I decided to plug it in for 10-15 minutes and it booted up as normal.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "So far (after about two weeks), this walknbook works well.  It does everything noted in the description on the website. I had no problem setting it up and was able to get the apps I wanted.  What I have found though, is that it doesn't work like a tablet.  I have not been able to connect it to my desktop computer via usb to transfer mp3books or music because my desktop won't recognize it.  I'm no computer geek and this brings me to my main complaint which is that the support is terrible.  There is no user manual available to download so that means you must contact customer service. There is no live chat, but they will respond via email.  The problem there is that  their technicians obviously are from abroad and their ability to answer questions in English is very limited, almost unintelligible.  I've had to guess at what they mean.  The  sales pitch says they have great customer support because irulu is made in the US, but their technicians certainly are not from this country.\n  Overall the walknbook works well, but I'm not happy with the support aspect.  I would be very happy with this if the support were better. Update:  Oct. 9.  When I tried to upgrade to Windows 10, I began having problems with the Walknbook.  After finally reaching customer support in this country, they sent me a replacement and so far it's working well.  I have since upgraded to windows 10 again and it's working fine.  So I am feeling quite happy with Irulu even if the response is slow.  They really do make an effort to remedy problems once they understand what is needed."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "Hi. I bought this IRULU tablet 3 weeks ago hoping to update my tablet experience and I didn't want to worry about the desktop to tablet experience and vice versa. I primarily use a tablet as a consumption device and I have used Android tables (specifically at Asus TF101) as my main consumption device. So far I'm pretty happy with the experience this tablet gives.\n\nHere are my thoughts in no particular order.  These are based on things I look for in a tablet device and so my review is not like many in-depth reviews out there. This may get long but I figure it'll address many of the questions being asked.\n\n1) The device is fairly well made. Seems like you could take it apart if you needed to (not advised). Out of the box, it is a fingerprint magnet front and back. I bought the IRURU tempered glass protector (I missed the deal below where you buy both it and tablet for a discount. Doh!) and that makes a big difference. The screen protector is definitely oleophobic and doesn't much to the thickness of the device. Regardless, keep a microfiber cloth around. The device is reasonably light but not the lightest tablet around. It weighs about 1.3lbs.  My old Asus TF101 was 1.5lbs.\n\n2) When you charge the tablet it gets warm on the back left side. I assume the CPU is there since it gets warm there too when the tablet is being worked (i.e. video playback) The power adapter will get even warmer (i.e. closer to hot) but there is an auto-shutoff in the adapter that will stop charging when the tablet is charged. At this point, both the adapter and tablet are cool to the touch. This is not any different from the Android tablets out there that get warm when you use them. When I say warm, it's not hot burning but it's definitely warmer than warm. If you plan to use this device to play games then you might be using it connected to the power adapter and should know about the heat output.\n\n3) Is this a full windows device? Yes. Windows 8.1 with Bing is a full version of windows where you can't change the default MS search settings by design. You can always go to Google if you want via web browser. Adobe Flash is installed by default. I test desktop accessibility by going to hulu.com. Android devices, unless you use the paid hulu app, will be gated from viewing video with the warning that some hulu content isn't allowed on mobile devices.  With the windows tablet there's no issue with playing hulu videos.\n\n4) The performance is pretty snappy.  I was able to open 8 web tabs (on both desktop and Metro IE) with no problems.  I went to YouTube, espn.com, sfgate.com in addition to some other web pages to test.  I was able to load up Company of Heroes from Steam and the graphics test gave me an average frame rate of 35 fps on low settings.\n\n5) Battery drain is similar to Android tablets I think. At rest, you can expect to lose about 5% battery charge every 8 hours. If you just leave the tablet with the screen off on a table it will probably last 5 days before needing a recharge. I think it will last longer if the tablet is in actual sleep mode (haven't tested it). I suspect with more than moderate use the tablet will last about 4-5 hours in my guestimate.\n\n6) It's nice that a keyboard was included. It's basically a netbook keyboard. It seems work well but the layout could be better.  The right shift key is too short and the caps lock and left shift key are too long.  Also the right shift key is an awkward position. The touch pad is reasonably responsive. Not much you can do to disable tap to click (I dislike that). Someone had a problem with getting the tablet to recognize the keyboard in the reviews. Make sure you connect the keyboard before you first turn on the tablet. When you turn on the tablet it goes through auto-setup and it will load the drivers for the tablet. The keyboard seems to be plug and play too so that's good. I didn't have a problem with keys being clicked on when the included case was closed but I did have the screen protector so that might have helped. The Dragon Touch XL (which OEM's this tablet I think) has the same keyboard design but with a better button layout that addresses my nitpicks with the IRULU keyboard.\n\n7) The warranty info requires you to fill out a review in order to get the full 1 year warranty. IRULU doesn't include that information with the tablet but they do follow up with you via email on that.  Still it would be nice for all that information to bet there.\n\n8) Of the 32GB you get, you can see about 29GB due to storage overhead. Of the 29GB, 7GB goes to the Windows install and 5.37GB goes to a special recovery partition to restore your tablet to factory default in case of emergency.  So out of the box you really only have about 15GB to play with for local storage which means you'll want to get yourself and SDXC card. I chose to get a 64GB SDXC card from.\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TB8XZOK?redirect=true&ref_=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_4\n\nI have no doubt that this tablet is based off an OEM reference design. The other tablet I looked at is Dragon Touch XL. It has everything this tablet has but it comes with 64GB instead of 32GB and a better keyboard layout. At the time I bought this tablet that would have meant I needed to pay $39 for the extra 32GB. Due to price, I chose the getting a 64BG SDXC card for $21 and I install apps on that card instead.\n\nSo overall, I'm happy with my purchase. I think IRULU could improve the included keyboard with minimal cost and include the 64GB storage as a default."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "Pros:\n- Functions almost like a laptop; good for students (undergrad, grad, professional)\n- Light, portable, compatible with Adonit Jot Pro (however, beware that this highly-accurate stylus does scratch the screen)\n\nCons:\n- Keyboard is small, so for big hands, typing might be uncomfortable (you'll miss some keys). I have small hands and I still miss keys.\n- Trackpad is so close to the left hand/palm. I've noticed that when I'm typing, my palm naturally brushes against the trackpad and causes the cursor to end up where it shouldn't be. For example, I'll type in a URL but end up accidentally opening a new tab because the cursor/arrow moved and clicked on the \"+\" tab of my browser. I don't know if this has been an issue with anyone else.\n- Sound quality could improve, though for around $200, I'm not complaining\n- Wall charger is short. If your battery dies and you want to be playing w/the irulu on your bed, you're going to have to make sure there's an outlet really close to you\n- Tablet will heat up during charging\n- Programs and apps (e.g. browsers, netflix, onenote, etc.) have been crashing easily for me, so far. I hope this isn't an ongoing issue.\n- Screen protector: there are two plastic layers covering the screen----one is supposed to be removed, and as for the second layer, I don't quite understand what purpose it serves and here's why: mine was unevenly placed and some flap was hanging. Does this mean I'm supposed to take it off? Or is this a screen protector that comes with the walknbook? I kept mine, because I bought a glass shatter-resistant protector specifically for the walknbook but that broke (ironically) as I was placing it over the screen. So I had to re-apply the second plastic layer, at least for now.\n\nAll in all, good price for such a functional little machine. I'm having more issues than anticipated, but they're not deal-breakers and I'm able to either resolve them or learn to adjust/deal with it."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "I love my new IRULU Walknbook! I thought it would be cheesy compared to the Surface Pro (which my boss has) but boy was I wrong! It has excellent resolution on the large 10 inch screen and is pretty darn fast. When I compared it side by side with the Surface Pro I found it to be every bit as functional and easy to use. All for about one third the cost! I've showed my new Walknbook to several friends and they all loved it so much that many of them have already been shopping for one.\nIf you need a lot of memory I recommend adding a memory card but I promise that you will love your new IRULU with or without it. So far, I do not regret buying this in lieu of the Surface Pro."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "Wonderful!!! I wanted a tablet, but still with the features of a pc (I hate the stuff that is app-based, like the ipad). It is fast, you can keep multiple windows open at the same time and multi-task. The graphic is amazing (at least compared to my Sony Vaio). It comes with office 365, 1 tera of space on the cloud, and I also bought an additional microSD (it expands up to 128gb). What I really love about it is that the first day I tested the battery duration, and it lasted 15 hours (mostly standby, but I used it for at least 4 hours, so I am pretty happy). Another supergreat thing is that it has usb and miniusb. Oh, and the sound! it is 3 times better than my pc.\nIf I have to think about cons, maybe the fact that it is heavier than an ipad (again, it depends on what you want, I wanted a bigger thing, and this is 10.1, slightly heavy). I absolutely love the fact that I paid it much less than it is worth, and that I did not have to pay for the brand. In fact, I also bought the case, which is supernice, for 10 bucks, whereas those who are branded cost 5 times as much. Superamazing. Highly recommend!!"}

The only thing that might cause any limitations is the size of RAM if you are running large programs, although it seems that I might be able to get Adobe CS6 to run, and that is a huge bonus for me. The storage could also be a problem for some people, but you could work around that in several different ways if you really need more space. I haven't tried out a whole lot yet, since I was dealing with some issues with my lap top when my Irulu Walkenbook arrived.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "I must say first that Irulu encourages buyers to leave reviews by offering an extended guarantee, which is not bad in itself as long as the reviews are candid ones. Which means than an avalanche of reviews might not be motivated by a wonderful product but because people want to get their extended guarantee.\n\nThat said, lemme tell you that the product is pretty good considering the price.\n\n1. I had troubles installing the office 365. It simply didn't work and was constantly sending an error. I had to contact Microsoft support service. They asked permission to take control of my tablet and did the installation. What was going wrong? No clue, but the Microsoft folks solved it.  a small nuisance. Because it's now solved, I'm not complaining anymore.\n\n2. I also noted noted the heat on the back of the tablet, left bottom corner, reported by other reviewers. Not that you get burnt, but its noticeable. Yesterday I watched a Netflix movie (1.5 hrs) and I was able to feel the heat while I held the tablet, but it never grew up to the point of being uncomfortable or burn me. Some laptops get really hot when you place them on your legs (of you're working lying on your bed) and the Irulu tablet was not even near that.\n\n3. As noted by other reviewer, sever gigabytes are gone from the hard disk. Supposedly, this is a 32 gb tablet, but only 23 gb are reported by Windows Explorer. Nine are gone, poof! Where are them? Beats. me. Out of those 23, only 16 were usable, because the rest were arleady occupied by Windows and Office. So, it's paramount that you get a memory card and make sure that any new software is installed in the card rather than in the main hard drive.\n\n4. The tablets works pretty well out of the box, let's be fair. Maybe not as fast as a Surface, but fast enough to work on it. The Wi-Fi connection is not ultra fast, but again is fast enough. I mean, what were you expecting for $199 when a MS Surface could be over $1000 starting at $500???\n\n5. I haven't measure the battery, but I don't think it's lasting the 7 hours promised. 4 maybe. Dunno if mine might be defective, or if all batteries behave in the same way. I haven't measured it, it's just an impression.\n\n6. Some other reviewers reported a jumpy mouse pad. I din't suffered it. Mine works pretty sell. You can connect a mouse through the USB port. I've already done so and it worked well.\n\n7. The keyboard's is quite small. If you're planning to type a lot it&iquest;s better to  connect a larger one, either by bluetooth or USB. I connected my Apple bluetooth keyboard that I use in my iPad to the Irulu tablet and it worked perfectly well.\n\n8. I think there's a Samsung Android Tablet TV ad in which the Surf is criticized for being a computer, not a tablet. Well a tablet with builtin Microsoft OS IS a computer, and the advantage is that you can affix a keyboard or a mouse if you wish so. that the reason why I purchased this Irulu tablet. Duh!\n\n9. I've already dropped it by accident, and it didn't break. Seems to be they are strong enough.\n\n10. The keyboard cover is cool, all magnetic, and the tablets stands very well on it. The linen cover seems to pick dust and lint at the slightest provocation, but it otherwise looks nice and classy.\n\n11. The screen is not amazingly responsive, but it's responsive enough.\n\n12. So far, it's a product I recommend, and please don't think I'm recommending it for the extended guarantee. I would be returning it if I weren't satisfied. It's more than enough for the price paid and delivers what was promised. I'm happy with it.\n\n13. So far, I don't see the Windows 10 little logo on my screen, hope it doesn't mean I'm not getting the Windows 10 upgrade. That would be the only missing thing, but I expect to see it appearing any of these days. Windows 8 sucks, everybody knows it, hope Windows 10 may not."}

And for the most part it did not disappoint.\n\nHowever, there were some slight issues:\n\nHeat: To begin when I first opened the box, and begin to set up the device for use I noticed that the side of the tablet with all the ports began to get increasingly hot, and this worried me because I was only using it for little more than an hour. Granted, I'm not saying that it's NEVER supposed to get hot, especially with excessive usage, but I didn't expect this so early in the usage. Even now as I am writing this review I can almost smell the heat.\n\nInternet Connection: The second problem I experienced was that sometimes my internet connection would suddenly turn off, and I would have to restart the device in order to reconnect. Now, this could possibly be a problem of my own internet box  However, my old tablet rarely did this, if at all.\n\n23 GB: This was supposed to be a thirty-two GB tablet but it only has 23 GB of storage space, and I have already used up 9.46 GB, wheres the rest!? Maybe, I'm missing something? I'm not sure. I expect for 32 GB to be written somewhere. I still have yet to find it.\n\nThose are the only problems I have experienced so far.\n\nNow! On to the good parts!\n\nSome of the other reviewers mentioned that this device was easily mistaken by others as a Surface Pro, and it's true. A LOT of people seem to think that this is a Surface Pro, it's basically the same design and functions the same, except its more affordable, and I love it the more for that\n\nKeyboard: also, a lot of people have mentioned that the keyboard was a bit too flimsy to place on their laps. I had only a slight problem with the keyboard, which was easily resolved once I placed the tablet and keyboard on the box it came in, and it sort of became a lap table. Works Great!\n\nMicrosoft Office: I really love that this tablet came with a one year subscription of Microsoft Office, especially since I plan to use it for college. It saved me a lot of money, in terms of not having to buy a keyboard and subscription.\n\nDesign: I love the windows design, and it works great for work and school. I have never before used a windows device, previously preferring apple, and I learned how everything worked within two days. It is simple and easy to move from one app to another with just the swipe of a finger. Also, most of the stuff I could not figure out , I jut googled online.\n\nAll in all I give this a 4/5 for its affordability, flexibility, and overall performance."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "I purchased the IRULU Walknbook laptop/tablet about a month ago and wanted to use it for a while in order to give it a fair review.  I use my tablet at home to read local newspaper and TV news and articles, and to keep up with friends annd family on social media. My main use for the tablet is that I use it on my small fishing boat for navigation. I use OpenCPN chartplotter software that receives GPS information from a Holux GPS puck, but  I also have my android phone paired with the tablet to use as a GPS backup in case of problem with the usb setup.  I also have a sdr-rtl usb stick set up to receive AIS information and input to OpenCPN.  I purchased a cord to connect to my 12volt charger to keep the tablet running as the battery life of the IRULU is only about 4 hours running the navigation software.  The screen brightness is comparable to most tablets and laptops that I have seen and is not quite bright enough for direct sunlight viewing, but it is sufficient for my use inside of the cabin on my boat.  The tablet runs the software smoothly and without any lockups or freezes. I installed a 64 gig sdcard for my data files and still have sufficient (about 11 gig) space left on the internal storage after all my software is installed.\nThe case of the IRULU windows 8.1 tablet is very strong and well made and does not have any soft spots or loose fits anywhere.  The included keyboard is usable for me as I am a 2 finger typist, but I wouldn't want to type a novel on it. I mostly use the touchscreen functions when on the boat and leave the keyboard at home for use there.  The keyboard/case's stand is usable on a table, but does not function too well in the lap.\nOverall, I would say that the IRULU Walknbook 10.1 Hybrid Laptop/Tablet is a bargain compared to what else is offered in the Windows 8.1 market. I returned a Toshiba Satellite Radius 11 less than a week old when the keyboard and trackpad quit working.  I would definitely buy another IRULU tablet when the need arises and I recommend it to all of my friends and family."}

I have this device less than a week and so far it appears very capable of doing some of the key things I need. It appears to be well made and responsive. I agree with other reviewers about the heat on the back and about the bubbles on the screen protectors.

It gets really hot on the back to side with the ports at times. This mainly occur  during multitasking. I figured that is the side where the processor is located. Since nobody has complained out that so far I am guessing that its normal on mine is just the problem.\n\n2.

This will work for you if:\n\n* You plan to just checking emails and maybe a little internet browsing\n* Average youtube or amazon video watching\n* Basic Word or word processing\n* can deal with low sound even when turned up all the way\n\nIt will NOT work for you if:\n\n* you like to do heavy internet browsing/shoppping (multiple tabs jumping around comparing deals, etc)\n* having videos playing while working on other tabs (ram barely handles it)\n* you want to watch a movie with your friends on it (did it but we had to be super quiet)\n\nIt couldn't handle more than two heavy tabs open though and would often crash the browser. I felt it too slow for my fast pace as I like to have 5-7 tabs open at once, flipping between them. It also will not start up for 15 minutes if it's completely drained and  needs a charge. You just need to keep checking back, click the power button and hope it turns on eventually. It also managed to get a blacklight bleed about the size of a dime on the upper part of the screen. Not too bad to ignore but still...I don't know how that happened because I kept it in it's protective cover which should have helped it from being pressed too hard when I packed up to move.\n\nThe removable keyboard is pretty cool but it's too small of a keyboard to not lose your mind trying to type without making mistakes. You will also end up hitting the track pad a lot by accident, messing you up.\n\nI have since upgraded to a real laptop and am glad I did. I will save this as a portable tool to use maybe to take notes in class or something or watch a video on the go but little more. For around $200 you are getting a decent tablet for the price and while I wasn't expecting it to be able to do everything a well built laptop can, I was still left a little dissapointed when it could barely run two tabs without running out of RAM"}

I like that the device comes with a keyboard that magnetically attaches to the device, although I've noticed a couple to times while typing on it the screen will randomly jump to another location.  Not sure what would cause that, but will keep an eye on it.  Also, I've been encountering an issue with the mouse pointer sometimes jerking around the screen when using the keyboard touchpad, so something else to keep an eye on.  Otherwise, it's a fast tablet at a good price.\n\nA couple of weeks later:\n\nAfter posting the review above, I received a quick response from the seller suggesting that I contact their customer service to get a keyboard replacement because the issue I was having was a result of a defective keyboard. I did, and they took care of everything without any effort on my part, and a week later I received a new keyboard.  I was very impressed with how easy it was. Now my Walknbook is working beautifully. As a result, I've upgraded my rating from 4 to 5 stars.  I'm still amazed at how fast the device is compared to my Android tablets.  Sometimes I think I'm working on a laptop, and you can't beat the outstanding price. I own 4 laptops, 3 tablets, and a desktop; and I'll have to say that right now this is my favorite device."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "I really like the Walknbook hybrid.  I will tell my experiences followed by some pros and cons.  The build quality does seem to be good.  The company did a good job with it and you can get real work done.  Just to let anyone know because I didn't know this when I bought; the Office 365 free year is for the personal license, 1 pc, 1 tablet and 1 phone,  not the Family Office 365 which gives you 5 pc's, 5 tablets and 5 phones.  Just FYI there.\nThe tablet is big enough to get stuff done but small enough to carry around all the time.  The free keyboard is well made and a nice addition, but has somewhat smaller keys; if your a woman, great, if your a 6'5\" guy, maybe not so much.  I might get a full sized Bluetooth keyboard to go with this.\n\nPros:\n1) light and small\n2) sturdy build quality\n3) free keyboard and track pad\n4) real windows 8.1, not RT; should be able to upgrade to 10.\n\nCons:\n1) gets a little warm on the back but not hot.\n2) non-standard power adapter, usb would have been better.\n3) gaudy colors.  I know neon colors are the rage but what about just plain black?\n4) Windows 8.1.  Hopefully this will be rectified in windows 10.\n\nI almost didn't buy this one because of the gaudy orange color.  But none of the other windows tablets had the good reviews this one does and I'm glad I bought this one."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "Product is a hefty mid-size tablet; feels solidly made. Setup was easy, although you're limited to an outlook email account if you want to create a microsoft account (which, again, seems necessary to activate Microsoft Office programs.)  I've downloaded a couple simple games -- the sound quality is adequate, and the graphics seem better than average. The keypad works well, but I agree with other reviewers, the magnetic connection and fairly flimsy engineering of the stand make it usable only on a desk, but it does work well that way. I have a couple problems with the little pamphlet that is the user guide. On the pages that number the tablet's features and describe them the numbers in the red circles are so so so tiny you'll need a magnifying glass to read them. The pamphlet also says there is a true user's guide on the irulu website -- I looked, but couldn't find it. But after using the device for a couple days, I think it is well worth the price."}

The only reason this product doesn't get five stars from me is the fact iRulu does not have any protective cases available for the this tablet. You can purchase a sleeve case and a tempered glass screen protector, but no protective case. The keyboard case it comes with is nice when it's closed, however, it's flimsy when set up and in use. I have looked everywhere, including calling iRulu and they have confirmed it is currently impossible to buy a folio or otterbox type case for the Walknbook. It's extremely disappointing. I really hope cases are made available in the near future."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "Update Nov 2016:\nTablet's battery died. Tried to replace it but I cannot find a proper replacement. Requested support from the manufacturer, however then cannot help and they do not sold the battery separately.\nWhile this tablet lasted (1.5 years) it was great as I could do my job without issues (performance or others) and with a nice looking device, but at this point I am disappointed that cannot fix it. The working life of this tablet has been too short and seems I will need to buy another device (not the same for sure). Reducing my evaluation from 5 stars to 3 due to this issue.\n\nUpdate Sept 2016:\nTablet continues to work with no issues. I am using it daily for regular work (office, movie making, etc).\n\nFor long time I has been looking for a tablet that can replace a Laptop (with proper limitations). Conducted searches in Internet and found good reviews for this Irulu Tablet. What caught my attention was the comment that it has a full version of Windows 8.1 and that it is possible to install productivity software on it. I also noticed there were a lot of positive feedback for this Tablet.\nI took the decision and bought the device. After a week working with the Tablet it present a hardware issue and I was not able to turn it back on. Sent the notice to Irulu and since the first day their team get in contact with me to replace the device. They were very diligent and sent me a new Tablet which is working really well and have no issues. Additional follow-up from Irulu team was conducted to ensure I have no further issues. This kind of service gave me the better impression from Irulu support and I feel my investment is protected by the manufacturer.\nIn this Tablet I installed the office 360 suite (license is included with the device) and decided to try with other applications. I was able to install Gymp, OrCad (Lite Edition) and Calibre and they are working just fine. I have to say that performance is really good and I can use this Tablet for personal productivity in the same way I use my Laptop. It is a great computer and I will recommend to anyone looking for a similar device.\nTo this Tablet I connected external devices such as Hard Drives and DVD reader/writer units and they work well. I am also using my mobile phone in USB tethered mode to connect to Internet. In the TF bay I inserted a 32G card and I am using it as Drive D: to save my documents.\nOverall, this Tablet is an excellent companion and I am very happy with it and the Irulu support. I recommend this for anyone looking for a similar mobile computer."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "I purchased this item a few weeks ago to use for travel and weekend use at my local RC flying field. I travel frequently and I wanted something a little more versatile than my tablet while I was on the road. Also, I am an avid RC airplane hobbyist and I frequently needed something at the field to program the PID loops on my 250 quad flight controller boards. So with that in mind here is my feedback after use in the last few weeks.\n\nRC airplane and Quad use\nPro\n-Full size USB port allows me to use the different cables I need to use Cleanflight and change parameters on my Naze32 and Flip32 boards\n- Handles every program I've loaded so far such as BLHeli, Cleanflight, Eagletree Vector software, etc. No issues with USB drivers so far!\n- Connects quickly, the operating system is not laggy at all\n- No issues with configuring various software for my RC stuff\n- Battery life was awesome!\n- It's nice and small so it's not taking up space like my old laptop\n- Using a Bluetooth mouse was easy to set up and configure\n\nCon\n- The screen was a little hard to see, but on second thought, I didn't try to change the brightness or contrast either. It was good enough to see what I needed to see though\n- The keyboard becomes disconnected from the tablet unless it's on a firm surface\n- The cursor tends to jump around very easily if you rest your palms on the bottom of the keyboard. This can be disconcerting in that you may select a specific place to change a setting and then look down at the keyboard, type your setting and then look up to realize the cursor had moved and you were changing something else. It is annoying but I'm holding out to see if it's an issue\n\nTravel\nPro\n- Lightweight and portable it's easy to forget it's in my backpack\n- Connects quickly to WiFi\n- Start up and shut down are very quick due to the SSD hard drive\n- Does pretty much everything my laptop can do in a much smaller package\n- Battery power is awesome!\n\nCons\n- Typing an email got very frustrating as the cursor kept moving while I was typing. To better explain, while typing a sentence I would notice that all of a sudden I was typing in the middle of a sentence in the paragraph above the one I was in. This got rather frustrating as I had to keep using the mouse to bring the cursor back down to where I was typing. I found that my left thumb was very slightly touching the keypad while I was typing causing this. My hands are not small so it's a little hard to type with this keyboard.\n- There were 2 different pieces of plastic on the screen. I assumed that one was a protective film to be removed and that the other was more like a semi-permanent screen protector, although I could be wrong. The tablet is stored in it's cover with the keyboard facing the screen, I noticed that there is some marring now on the plastic from the keyboard touching it. I'm afraid to remove the plastic because I don't want the keyboard to scratch the screen. I assume this was from having it in my backpack during air travel on the road. I've placed a small piece of bubble wrap between the screen and keyboard to protect it.\n- I would prefer to not carry a separate charging device. It would be nice to just plug a USB cable into the port and charge it from my phone's wall charger\n\nTips\nCharging the battery for the first time. Turn the tablet off. Undock the tablet from the keyboard while charging. It will charge faster this way.\nCheck the screen from damage from the keyboard. I'm going to find a small square of felt to keep between the screen and keyboard.\n\nOverall\nWell worth the money! It's small, lightweight and very fast. I'm not concerned about memory because I'm not storing media on here. That's what they make clouds for!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "I'll start off by saying that I originally wrote a negative review like someone else on here, because of some issues. I eventually resolved the issues myself, but irulu contacted me anyway. I appritiate that they contacted me to try and help solve the issues. Now to the review:\nGood job irulu on making a tablet this light, compact, and portable! I LOVE that it slides right into my backpack and doesn't make it feel heavy, unlike my old Asus Transformer pad. This has a full sized usb port, which allows me to use all the hardware that I already have. It runs games smoothly and I love that it runs full Windows 8. The storage is not great, 32gb, but an sd card is an easy fix for that. And the best thing of all, the price. If you want a Windows tablet, or even a laptop, and don't want to flush your money down the toilet, this is it. It cannot play intensive games due to the 2gb of ram, but if you will just use it for smaller games and working on, it is amazing. We purchased one green and one orange one because we loved it so much!"}

If you are looking for a great value in a windows tablet that is nearly the same as a Surface 3 or Dell Venue 11 that doesn't cost nearly what a high end windows tablet costs, then you should consider this tablet.  The build quality is solid.  Weight and feel are adequate.  The screen is bright, but not quite as bright as I'd like it to be.  The keyboard has laptop-like keys and is a little small, but I have been able to adapt so it is not too small.  The processor, a last generation Intel Atom, is ok for light duty tasks (my uses) and probably some games.  Sound quality is acceptable.  I have not tried the camera.  The keyboard case that comes with the tablet is unique and very functional.  Other than screen brightness, it would be nice if the microusb port was an input for charging, the power adapter cord is very small, and tablet has to be put to sleep manually.  It doesn't sleep when the case is closed on it.  The negatives sound like product killers, but I'm merely writing to inform.  This tablet is so much less expensive than many other tablets that the negatives are really minor when you consider that loosing or breaking this tablet wouldn't be much more than an annoyance.  It is a great value and I would buy one again."}

It arrived today and I have been putting it through its paces all day. I must say, I am VERY pleased with it. I really can't say anything the people before me haven't already said in their reviews. This is a really nice tablet and seems like it will last a long time. So, since I can't add anything I'll just say a few simple things.\n\nTo the person who asked about it running Java.... it runs it just fine as far as I can tell.\n\nThis doesn't have 5.0ghz WiFi, I really wish it did and so far its only connecting at a max of 150Mbps on my 2.4ghz N network. I never saw the Ghz it connects through listed in the specs. most devices are supporting it now so I found it strange that it was 2.4 only.\n\nIf you plan on doing a lot of typing the included keyboard is a pain. I find that due to it's size my hands always seem to be in hitting the wrong keys. I'd also like to have a way to turn off the track pad. I keep hitting it on accident and just erased a bunch of this review I'm writing. For simple stuff this keyboard will work OK though. Really though for the price the keyboard is fine and it allows you to travel easy.\n\nAll in all this is an amazing tablet and hasn't let me down (if you know what a tablet can do with windows). iRulu really hit a home-run with this tablet."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "I love it so far. I love the bright display when watching Netflix. It also has the processing power that I need when using Office 365 and OneNote. Over the past few year's I've owned Iphones , Ipads, Ipod touches, small Android phones, large Android phones (Phablets), and Android tablets. Since the 1990's until the present day I've been purchasing and repairing PCs (desktops, netbooks, and laptops) with all the different versions of the Microsoft Windows ranging from Windows 3.0 to Windows 8.1. It took me awhile but this purchase was really a natural progression for me. Just before I purchased the IRULU Walknbook 10.1 I had just purchased a 7 inch HP Stream for under $89 which was my first windows 8 tablet. I liked it but I find myself straining with the small display. I decided I need to step up in size and came across this gem (IRULU 10.1) on Amazon. The price and the specs are what grabbed my attention. I did not purchase it to be a laptop or desktop replacement . So far I've installed Office 365, Dropbox, OneDrive, and along with Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome along with a 64 GB SD card.

(you may get a lesser amount of memory if you so choose).  This small upgrade will effectively turn your tablet into a Surface Pro, which last I checked retailed for well over $600.\n\n Plus Bonus Top 5 Beau Thoughts:\nIf I had 30 seconds to chat with someone who is considering purchasing this, I would share these top 5 things from my own experience of the product:\n\n1 Cost: It's an incredible price. Very good bang for you buck.\n2 Not a PC: Don't let the tiny keyboard fool you; it's not a PC, nor does it substitute as one. If you're looking for a tablet where you mainly watch Netflix, read email, and browse Facebook, this is for you.  Other things like typing essays, researching on the internet for homework projects, storing photos, videos, installing software or games should be reserved for something with a larger hard drive and better responsiveness. (i.e. a laptop) You will get very frustrated if you try to power through these tasks using this tablet!\n3 Touch sensitivity: It is not as good as an iPad, however I say this well aware that this tablet is 50% the cost of an (overpriced?) Apple product (of course if you can afford Apple, go for it!). Just keep in mind that you will find yourself touching everything at least twice trying to get the tablet to register what you want. (as demonstrated in my video)\n4 Long set-up time: Once everything's in place, it's a breeze to navigate, but just keep in mind the learning curve on this is a couple days for tech savvy people.  Unless you've had a Windows tablet before, you will be very confused the first 12 times you pick this tablet up. Again, once you've got the hang of things, it's fine.  Just be patient with it.\n5 Keyboard cover: Nice clicky feedback, like a real life keyboard, however it takes a while to get your fingers used to the small keyboard setup.  Do note also that the keyboard detaches very easily. VERY easily.  Almost to the point where you'll get frustrated how often it unclicks itself (it magnetically attaches to the tablet).  I would recommend using this tablet on a sturdy surface (e.g. NOT on your lap while sitting on the couch), or you'll be rather annoyed with how it keeps falling apart on your lap.\n\nHope this is helpful! Note the company sent me this product to demonstrate on video and offer my personal opinion. I don't work for them, nor am I paid anything that might sway my personal opinion of this product's performance.\n\n Bottom line: would I recommend this product to one of my friends?\n Yes, especially for the price (which makes it 5/5 stars for me), however be wary; you sacrifice some performance with the price.  This tablet is for the thrifty people who are tech savvy and patient... patience is key!"}

I wanted a light, super-portable machine for travel that could handle Microsoft Office plus email and that could be plugged into a projector on occasion. This one seemed just right, but after ten minutes I found that I couldn't actually use the Office functions, aside from bringing up files. The machine just can't handle it. Word kept pausing to think every couple of key strokes, making it impossible to compose even a single sentence. Aside from that, the keyboard was too small for me to type on, and the touch screen was too wonky to do anything with. In the end, this is a perfectly fine tablet for a good price, but it simply can't be used like a laptop. I wonder why they even bother to try. Tablets are for watching Youtube videos; laptops are for work. Never the twain shall meet. I'm now in the market for an ultrabook.\n\nOn the positive side, I got to learn this valuable lesson first hand and had no trouble at all sending the product back for a full refund. UPS came and picked up the package the next day. Simple as that."}

I had assumed it would have A full rubber keyboard to protect from unwanted spills and junk. Either way, its cool though. It seems to have quite a bit of stuff already installed. That can be construed as good or bad. Its OK for me though. I usually just weed through the ones I want. If I was going to rate this tablet PC from 1 to10. 10 being the best.

The memory is a little on the low side for this, but there are some tricks you can use to install programs to MicroSD cards.  It comes with full windows 8.1, Office, and a Terrabyte of Onedrive space (which should alleviate the lack of storage on the tablet).

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00URGA106", "review": "The best $200 I've spent in a long time.  This is a well built machine and it has done everything flawlessly so far.  The only complaint that I have is the keyboard cover.  It is of nice quality but can flop down sometimes but it definitely isn't a deal breaker.  Their customer service is quick to respond and is very helpful. The speakers sound pretty good on it and I think it's a steal at this price point.  I bought it to for my son to use for school and whatever else his life may call for computer, tablet or entertainment wise.  It has a plethora of uses and is highly connectable to whatever your little heart desires.  I haven't tried streaming movies on it yet but I don't foresee any problems there.  The only thing I would say that this thing is missing is a stylus.  You can buy one separately but it should come with one.  I'm an artist and not a fan of the rubbery tip stylus'.  For the common Joe this will probably not be an issue and for the money I paid, it is not an issue here either.  All in all this is a solid purchase and I would by another one and I would also recommend it to anyone looking for a similar device.\n*****REVISED*****  First the company plays games with their pricing.  I paid $219 for my tablet and two days later the price is $189.  I emailed the company and they refunded me $10 and sent me a screen protector and a stylus.  I figured this was fair.  I'm trying to give them a break because it is a new company.  After having this device for a few months and hardly using it, I have to downgrade it severely.  There have been internet connectivity issues from day one.  I kept thinking it was something wrong with my network, but this is the only device having issues.  You have to restart every few minutes to get an internet connection.  I now see that I'm not the only one complaining about this issue.  Then the keyboard case stopped working.  This is a device that I have used maybe 10 times since I purchased it.  It sits either in my backpack or on my desk collecting dust.  So after further usage, I have to downgrade this tablet and take away my stamp of approval.  Find something else.  This company is not ready for prime time.  There is a reason that the Surface costs what it does."}

This machine works at the level of larger machines which I have used in my research. For teaching it is light and as capable as required to demonstrate concepts for the students. The combination of tablet and keyboard I find the flexibility I've come to us, seamlessly. But for transportation, the lightness and compactness is much more than I imagined. The way the keyboard and stand fold up is remarkable. I am disabled and had difficulty moving around with anything in my hand. But no more. To me this is the greatest benefit of all. My only criticism is that one key (p) gets stuck. But I'm sure Irulu will fix it quickly, for their commitment to their customers is another important benefit to me."}

However, that being said, it gets a four star rating (if I could give half star rating it would get 4.5 stars) due to the fact that about 20% of the time on boot-up and sometimes when I remove the power plug to run on battery or detach from the keyboard the touch screen goes non-responsive and the only way to fix it that I can find, so far, is to reboot the machine. Admittedly, it could be a user error on my part as well. Other than that, this is overall a fine computer. I like the compact size and portability.\nI will be visiting the IRULU website to leave feedback on this product with specific regard to the touchscreen issue I've been experiencing. Hopefully it is just a simple software/firmware update that can be installed to fix this.\nSo, all in all, if you are considering purchasing this product don't let my minor touchscreen issue dissuade you from said purchase.
