You would not be buying an iPad quality tablet, but you would be getting a big screen Android tablet at a budget price with room to add storage for music, movies and photos. (Note - micro SD card and micro USB flash drives are not included, nor is a Bluetooth speaker as shown in the video.)\n\n----------------\n\nWHAT I WANT IN AN ANDROID TABLET\n\nI want a 10\" Android tablet for watching YouTube, Netflix and Hulu Plus. I also want to check email, surf my favorite websites (Facebook, SavvySleuth, Pinterest, Amazon...) and take photos and videos. I want it to connect easily to any available WiFi network, have the ability to increase its storage capacity and have a decent (2-3 hour) battery life on a single charge.\n\nThis Dragon Touch AIX-Plus can do most of this, with a few things that could be improved upon.\n\nThe biggest issues I have with this tablet and the reason I don't give it a perfect 5-star review relate to its cameras, connectivity, inflated promises (GPS...not so much) and fair battery life.\n\nLet me explain.\n\n------------------\n\nTHE \"PLUS\"\n\nThere is another AIX tablet from Dragon Touch on Amazon, but it doesn't have `Plus' in the title.\n\nWhat's the Plus to this one?\n\nThe `Plus' means it has FM radio.  I had to email the seller to figure this one out because at when I received this item from the seller to review it, there was no product info on their website.  (They've got it up now, but it's really not very comprehensive so email them with direct questions.)\n\nTo access the FM radio you have to have a wired headset connected to the tablet. (Something like this will do it:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Sony-MDR-ZX100-BLK-Stereo-Wired-Headphones-Over-the-ear-Lightweight-Collapsible-with-Neodymium-Magnets-30mm-Drivers-3-5mm-Plug-1-2m-cord-and-Adjustable-Headband-Black-ZX-Series-Brown-Box-Packaging/dp/B00PJKZFJC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Sony MDR-ZX100-BLK Stereo Wired Headphones Over-the-ear Lightweight Collapsible with Neodymium Magnets & 30mm Drivers, 3.5mm Plug, 1.2m cord, and Adjustable Headband (Black) ZX Series - {Brown Box Packaging}</a>.  The FM receiver in the tablet uses the wire in the headphones as an antenna.\n\nI found this to be a unique feature, but not one that most users who have WiFi will use at all. It would be useful if you were in a no-internet zone and wanted to listen to music though, and didn't plan on moving around a lot as that can affect FM reception.\n\n----------------------\n\nTABLET FEATURES & USE\n\nThe build quality of this tablet is better than most at this low price, yet the ability to gently move my finger on the back of the case and still see movement on the screen is disappointing. (A firm case is needed to protect this tablet, but I think that's the case with all of them.)\n\nThe screen is bright and sharp. Images look good, as does video, however viewing angles are very important. Direct line viewing is best.  If you get just a little off to the side, the screen appears dark.\n\n-----------\n\nThe sound is good too, and enhanced via a Bluetooth connection which is easy to setup in the Settings on the tablet.  I liked using a Bluetooth speaker with it to watch YouTube videos, and I tried it with Bluetooth headphones and it worked great. (This tablet can also use Bluetooth keyboards.)\n\nThese are products I'd suggest if you don't already have Bluetooth accessories that'll work:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Hype-Pyramid-10-W-Speaker-Stainless-Steel-Ultra-portable-Wireless-Rechargeable-Bluetooth-3D-Stereo-Speaker-Powerful-Sound-with-Built-in-Microphone-for-iPhone-6-Plus-5s-5c-5-4s-iPad-4-3-2-Retina-Air-Mini-iPod-Touch-Samsung-Galaxy-s5-s4-s3-Note/dp/B00K7KK2D8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Hype Pyramid 10 W Speaker Stainless Steel Ultra-portable Wireless Rechargeable Bluetooth 3D Stereo Speaker, Powerful Sound with Built in Microphone, for iPhone 6 Plus + 5s 5c 5 4s, iPad 4 3 2 Retina Air Mini, iPod Touch, Samsung Galaxy s5 s4 s3, Note, ...</a>&nbsp;- works great, as do these earbuds;&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Jarv-NMotion-Sport-Wireless-Bluetooth-4-0-Stereo-Earbuds-Headphones-with-In-Line-Microphone-Red/dp/B00H2QUD9S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Jarv NMotion Sport Wireless Bluetooth 4.0 Stereo Earbuds/Headphones with In-Line Microphone , Red</a>.\n\n------------\n\nThe `GPS' feature isn't really a GPS.\n\nThere is Location services in Settings which can be enabled and used with Google Maps, if you are connected via Wi-Fi.  There is no cellular data connection possible with this tablet, nor no stand-alone GPS feature, so I think this is an overstatement in the product description.\n\nPer TabletExpress - their explanation of what the GPS feature is was sent to me in an email on 1/29/15:\n\n\"GPS can only use in outdoors. You can please go to \"Settings\"--\"personal\" and tap \"Location, then you'll find there're some mode you can choose. Also you can download apps such as \"GPS Test\" to test if there has GPS in your area. Some map apps may help you when there's no wifi if you've download offline maps.\"\n\nI stand by my assessment - 'NO' real GPS feature is on this tablet. I went to Settings - Location - and turned on Location Services (which is only accessible via Wifi). Outside without Wifi - no GPS no matter what settings are on or off.\n\n-------------\n\nThe cameras are not this tablet's best feature.\n\nNeither the forward facing nor the rear facing cameras are what I would consider good.  Neither has high enough resolution to take sharp photos or video.  Photos I took were grainy and video was mediocre, but this does speak to the price and manufacturers have to cut corners somewhere!\n\nBoth cameras are located on the tablet housing in spots that if you happen to be holding the tablet in portrait mode with the ports at the top, you can't easily touch the shutter button as it's at the top of your screen.\n\nIf you use the camera with the shutter button at the bottom of the screen - you cover the camera!\n\nThus, the only real way to take photos or video is with the tablet in landscape orientation.  It's a user-interface issue that could potentially be fixed in later firmware updates.\n\n------------\n\nA really nice feature of this tablet is that you can easily expand the capacity from 16GB (works out to be 13GB after the OS and pre-loaded apps) to much more via micro SD (up to a 32GB card per the manufacturer) and a USB flash drive connected via micro USB.  I used one like this:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/SanDisk-Ultra-32GB-Micro-USB-2-0-OTG-Flash-Drive-For-Android-Smartphone-Tablet-With-App-SDDD-032G-G46/dp/B00HR78S2Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">SanDisk Ultra 32GB Micro USB 2.0 OTG Flash Drive For Android Smartphone/Tablet With App- SDDD-032G-G46</a>.\n\nI was able to view photos and play video from a USB flash drive via a micro USB connection, but the tablet did have an issue not being able to read a .WMA music file (Windows Music File) and play it.  It does pay .MP3 files just fine.\n\n--------------------\n\nWi-Fi connectivity is how this tablet gets the internet.\n\nIt's usually very easy to connect a tablet by finding the wireless network you want to connect to, then entering a password. I did that, but the tablet kept dropping the signal saying `problems authenticating'.\n\nI decided to use an alternative method. I used the WPS security button on my router with the setting on the tablet. The two paired easily and maintained the connection after doing it this way.\n\n-----------------\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThis is a good, budget 10.1\" Android tablet. It has a quick quad core 1.3Ghz processor with a 1074 x 600 resolution multi-touch screen. The screen is fairly responsive, and the tablet has enough memory (1GB) to stream media without a problem.\n\nThe cameras are not great, and the housing does have some flex to it, speaking to a budget-build quality.\n\nConnecting to WiFi wasn't effortless, there's no true GPS (as stated in the product description on Amazon) and the FM radio is the only \"plus\" per the manufacturer.\n\nI like that it has so many ways to expand its storage (both micro SD up to 32GB and via a micro USB flash drive) which means you can bring your photos, music and videos with you on the road to view on your tablet or share on a monitor or HDTV via a micro HDMI to HDMI connection (cable not included) - one like this:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/BlueRigger-High-Speed-Micro-HDMI-to-HDMI-cable-with-Ethernet-6-Feet/dp/B0060AU5MW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">BlueRigger High Speed Micro HDMI to HDMI cable with Ethernet (6 Feet)</a>. Being a cord cutter (not using cable TV) and using streaming media on my HDTV to supplement my over air free TV, I use things like this a lot.\n\nNOTE:  If you want to know how to cut the cord, check out my book:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Simple-Guide-to-Over-the-Air-Free-TV/dp/B00JT51P8I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Simple Guide to Over-the-Air Free TV</a>.\n\nThe battery life is not great, but adequate for a tablet its size. About 2-3 hours with intermittent stand-by and basic email and internet surfing. If you are streaming video, about 45 minutes to 1 hour. (You can extend this by picking up an external battery backup like this:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/RAVPower-3rd-Gen-Deluxe-13000mAh-External-Battery-Portable-Dual-USB-Charger-4-5A-Output-Power-Bank-iSmart-tm-Broad-Compatibility-Fast-Charging-High-Capacity-Ultra-Compact-For-iPhone-6-6-plus-5S-5C-5-4S-iPad-Air-mini-Apple-30pin-and-Lightning-Cab/dp/B00MPIGPUY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">RAVPower 3rd Gen Deluxe 13000mAh External Battery Portable Dual USB Charger 4.5A Output Power Bank. iSmart(tm) Broad Compatibility, Fast Charging, High Capacity, Ultra Compact. For iPhone 6 6 plus 5S 5C 5 4S, iPad Air mini (Apple 30pin and Lightning Cab...</a>&nbsp;and connecting the tablet to it when you are watching videos.)\n\n--------------\nRegarding charging...\n\nThere is a clear film that's on the screen when you get the tablet, with some writing that says 'charge battery 10 hours prior to first use'.  This is unnecessary per TabletExpress, although I did it anyway.\n\nThere's also an error in the directions about how to charge the tablet with the included 5V charger. There is no 5V (pin-type) charger included, but there is a USB to micro USB cable and a micro USB to AC wall charger included.  Both work to charge the device.\n\n1/29/15 - Per email from TabletExpress - the directions are wrong and will be changed in the future to reflect the accurate way to charge this device.\n\n----------\n\nOverall, it's a good choice for those who want a bigger screen and don't want to pay a hefty price.\n\nThere are lots of free Google Play apps (sign up on the tablet for a Gmail account or use an exisitng one)  you can add to this tablet for gaming, media streaming, and productivity. You can also easily add a Bluetooth keyboard case to make this tablet even more useful on the go.\n\nThe bottom line: It's not a high-end tablet, but many will be happy with it.\n\nThe company appears to want to uphold good customer service with phone number and email contacts available, and a 1 year warranty on the tablet.\n\n---------------------------\nNOTE:  I received this product from TabletExpress in exchange for my honest review.\n\nThe company does include an offer for a FREE GIFT in the tablet's box, which asks that purchasers review the item and send a copy of their review to the company to receive a free protective case.\n\n----------------------------\n\nUPDATE: 1/29/15 - Email from TabletExpress\n\nI was originally contacted by TabletExpress to review this tablet (about 10 days ago...) and asked that I write my review and then send it to them for their approval prior to posting.\n\nI wrote back to them:\n\n\"I understand you would like to have perfect 5 star ratings on your reviews to sell more tablets, however I will not agree to send you my review before posting nor will I agree not to post it if it's less than 4 stars.\n\nI write my reviews to help other Amazon shoppers to purchase items that will fit their needs.  I write reviews on products I purchase, some received from the Amazon Vine review program, and some products from sellers who request reviews as you did.  I do them all the same way in an attempt to be as objective, fair and honest as possible about the product and my experience with the company that sells it. I will understand if you do not want to send me your item for review.\"\n\nThey surprised me and wrote back saying that was OK and they'd send me the tablet anyway, with a protective keyboard case; asking that I review that as well:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Tabsuit-PU-Leather-Keyboard-Case-Cover-Stand-for-Dragon-Touch-10-1-A1X-A1-R10X-and-more-Android-Tablet/dp/B00EZAX2LA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Tabsuit PU Leather Keyboard Case Cover Stand for Dragon Touch 10.1'' A1X/A1/R10X and more Android Tablet</a>.\n\nThe seller told me they had confidence in their product and looked forward to the review.\n\n--------------------\n\nAs promised I reviewed this item honestly and fairly. However today I received an email from TabletExpress asking me to remove certain parts of this review that they didn't agree with or didn't want mentioned.\n\nI added their explanation of 'GPS' and their promise to fix the included directions which have improper charging instructions.\n\nThere was a request to remove a certain portion of the review, which I did not because it is honest and part of my experience with the product.\n\nThe product is not perfect, but I believe my assessment of it is fair and honest. I've shown the product in the video, and discussed its features to the best of my ability.\n\nIt's good for the price, and I trust that Amazon shoppers will be able to figure out if it's right for them or not, as long as they still have an honest review to consider before they buy."}

By then I purchased another one for myself thinking I may have done something to cause the charging port to break lose. I purchased the second one for myself because I really liked the tablet. It had a good picture and the photos from the camera were good. Low and behold within 1 year the charging port is an issue again. I have to play with it to get it to charge. I have been extra careful with this one but it looks like it wasn't my fault after all. This seems to be a common issue. Design flaw. Already purchased a different brand."}

Any hardware problem after the 90-days replacement warranty, we can provide you a repair service.\n\nThanks for your consideration in advance.\nBest regards,\n\nThe fact that they changed the warranty is angering, but I don't understand how you can be charged for something under warranty.\n\nMerriam-Webster's dictionary defines warranty as, and I quote, \" a usually written guarantee of the integrity of a product and of the maker's responsibility for the repair or replacement of defective parts.\"\n\nTabletExpress is a terrible company with terrible products that they don't stand by.

It is easy to use and has a large variety of apps that you can download. The battery life is great, and I love that it tells you how many minutes left it has to get a full charge while plugged in. As a family full of iPhone users, but having no experience with tablets, we are impressed.\n\nBut, there are a few minor downsides, which prompted the four star rating. The screen does not stay on very long, and we are constantly needing to re-click the button to wake up the screen. However, if you do it quick enough, you often don't have to unlock the device again before using, which is nice. The second downside is that the screen is really not all that sensitive and sometimes requires you to do the same action multiple times before it recognizes it. And lastly, it can be a little hard to see the screen if you are not looking at it directly head on, which doesn't cause much trouble unless multiple people are trying to see the screen at once.\n\nOverall I think my whole family would recommend this device to someone looking for a tablet, but not wanting to spend an exuberant amount of money."}

Initially opening them, I was prepared to plug them in and let them charge.  Surprisingly enough, They were over 75% charged at first time boot up.  Side by side, entering each of our information and getting them ready for first use:  While my husband was at work- I had a good portion of the day to \"dork around\" with mine.  In the beginning- it was great, simple for the seasoned \"Android\" phone/tablet user.  Mine had a small \"glitch\" of sorts and not the cute kinda glitch from Wreck It Ralph :)  While my husband had two home screens to swipe left and right from.. Mine only had one..  My first thought was \"I'm not gonna deal with this right outta the gate and wondered what could I exchange it for that was equal\"..  I took a moment to skim the User Manual with no success- and in the box, there was a small paper that said \"STOP.. Call us before returning product\".. So I did.  I called the number given several times and after holding for 7-10 minutes, I got an auto recording that asked me to send an email or call back.. After three attempts of calling them and while on my fourth attempt, I got a call coming in from their support team (so they have caller ID).  Told the representative my issue-- it took a couple of times explaining (different ways) to finally get across my problem.  After we came to agreement on what I was talking about and what he/she thought I meant, I hung up and attempted what was suggested.. THAT WORKED (a 1st tier tech that actually knew how to fix my simple problem the first time around- Thank You).  Moving on..  two days later, I still didn't like the fact that the keyboard didn't have the Swype function.. Guess What-  there's app's for that too :)  Needless to say, this tablet is growing on me, my intended use for this unit was for e-reading and for that purpose- IT'S GREAT..  OK.. my husband- he's a much more simpler individual :)  He simply LOVES his tablet and refuses to consider returning it or exchanging it.. In fact, all his free time is now spent using his tablet..  He has no complaints, he loves the size of the unit and he loves the graphic clarity of the unit.. ((We're both still playing with the camera function and it's quality))..  Another plus for this unit is the ability to assign separate user accounts..  We share our units with our daughter and she's simple smitten that she gets her own profile and doesn't have to swipe through a sea of mommy and daddy's junk app's just to get to her games.

At first I though it was amazing but with in less then a month it could not keep it's charge and always had to be plug in.  One day after a full not charge I power it up gave the 100% battery but instead of loading into android OS system I guess it went into the manufacture bios or something.  It was in Korean and it let out a high pitch peep that did not stop until and would not power back down until I unplug it.  Now it does not start up and only let out a high pitch sound if plug in.  Sad thing Is I only got to use it like three times.  Save your money and spend a bit more for something that going to last."}

That is until the screen cracked while my daughter was playing Star Wars Angry Bird a month after using it. I contacted the dealer immediately as it was advertised to have a full 1 year defect warranty. However, CS Tablet Express refused to repair it saying that it was a \"man made defect\".  Instead they wanted to charge me $35 for a new screen.  I thought it was not worth it since it could crack again while my 9yo plays her games.  If you are planning to buy this product (please consider this message from the manufacturer's email) \"We provide 90 days warranty with free replacement or repair work if it's quality issues. 1 year free software support and repair service for some models with charge varied from different conditions of the tablets.

I went ahead and did a bundle, keyboard case and a 3 pack of screen protectors.  When I opened the box, the tablet already had a screen protector applied.  It wasn't fully charged but more than enough power in the battery to play with it and do the initial setting on it.  It had a few bubbles on the screen protector, but I'll live with it until it gets bad and then I'll replace it.  It didn't come with extra apps so it was nice.  Previous tablet had more apps that I didn't use.  The response on it is great.  It goes from one app to the next very quickly.\nThe only down side is the resolution on the screen.  But I have played a movie on it and didn't mind it.  I have my college eBooks on it and have no issue with the text size or resolution.  But for that price, I'll adjust and enjoy it.  The body of it seemed good, but the back was plastic, but again for the price, you can learn to live with it too.  I did buy another cover for it.  The keyboard case was too bulky for what I'm using it for.  I would highly recommend this product.  If and when I'm in the market for another tablet, I will be coming back to buy another one from this manufacturer."}

All my items were either on time or arrived earlier. As for the Dragon Touch A1X Plus 10.1, I had a irritating first time experience using it. The touch screen acted as if it had a mind of it's own and wouldn't cooperate with me. Some areas of the screen would be unresponsive, while other areas the screen would register a few inches away from where my finger was placed on the touch screen. (\"Show visual feedback for touches\" option was turned on.)\n  Just when I was planning to return the product after an hour or so of using the tablet, I then realized that the more I used the touch screen, the better it behaved. So after a few days of constant use, the touch screen finally worked as intended. Overall performance was decent, there was a little lag here and there while using the tablet. The only other complaint that I have is that the charger cable is too short. I would rate this higher if the touch screen issue haven't happen."}

I got this for my 8-year-old son to keep at grandma's house for Skyping and playing games. We have several tablets floating around in our family and this is the first one that we've had a problem with. My mother has very plush carpeting at her house, and the tablet was sitting on an end table. While vacuuming, my father-in-law bumped the corner of the table. The tablet slid off and landed screen side up on the floor - no bouncing off the corner, just landed flat on the super-soft carpet. The glass layer of the screen underneath the plastic broke literally in half. Now, mind you, the coffee table itself is glass from bottom to top, legs and all. The table, despite being hit with a vacuum, came out unscathed. This flimsy little tablet screen split down the middle and rendered the touch screen useless. Unfortunately, this happened exactly 2 days after Amazon's 30-day return period, so now we have a paperweight. I'd rather just buy a whole new one from a more reputable company where I know I'll get quality, than try to track down a replacement part for this obscure off-brand tablet."}

They both suffer from the same defect; they do not charge after some time.\nAfter about a week, the first tablet stopped charging. I left it in overnight and the light still did not light up when I plug in the charger.\nSo I had to return that one which was fine since it was within the first 30 days.\nA month later (after the return date) the 2nd one stops charging. It was working fine and the light would come on when I charged it before. But now no light and no charge.\nI have multiple miniB usb cables that charge different devices and have tried them all. So it is not the cables, but the tablets.\nSo now I'm stuck with a brick.\n\nAnother complaint would be the screen reflection. If you do not look at it directly in front of the screen at the right angle, you can only see your reflection and not the screen. I have an ASUS tablet also and you can view the screen from any angle and any side. But this one seems to be made from some cheap glass. You have about a 5 degree angle to see the screen.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00S6B0IQ6", "review": "Well I've had this product for about a month now. I must say it is a pretty good budget tablet. I read all the reviews just as your reading this one and because of the honest reviews I decided to go for it, without regret to my purchase. It does everything I wanted in a tablet; access to all my google app's. My first tablet was a windows tablet and was so disappointed, I might as well have just purchased a lap top, I returned it right away. I haven't been away from my home WiFi access, but I'm pretty sure if there is WiFi I access, there wouldn't been a problem for this tablet it connected with no problem.\n\nPro's: The touch response is quick. Switching between open screens with the ease of a swipe. The start up is quick and painless. Battery life is awesome! I had the tablet charged in the morning used it off and on all day and my son has been on it  for 4 hours straight and its at 26%. and still going. The volume exceptional. Button placement took some getting use to, but convenient. Every time I wanted turn up or down the volume would accidentally hit the power button and turn the screen off. I have not purchase a TF card for more memory yet, but have already downloaded a couple of app's and so far so good, still a lot of space.\n\nCon's: There is a bit of glare on the screen, especially in well lit area's. You can adjust the brightness, but it doesn't make any difference. Low light the screen has perfect contrast. Discovered through the reviews the tablet comes with a screen protector already on it. I thought it did just cause the cut out around the camera, it can be removed if gently lifted with a safety pin. I do not recommend it, because the screen is easy to be scratched. I do my best to care for my purchases and tried to review the difference in glare on the screen without the protector and dust got on the screen, tried wiping off with a soft screen cloth and the dust scratched the screen lightly, so I put the protector back on. thinking of getting an anti-glare one. The camera is fine, but not the best, I didn't purchase the tablet for pictures, that just ridiculous to me. Get a camera or use your phone.\n\nI did think about returning the tablet because of the glare, and that's about it, because it does do what I am looking for and you can't beat the price, the glare apparently was no big deal compared to the accessibility it gave me by providing me with relief from my phone's tiny screen and dying battery.  In the future I do plan to purchase another tablet, but in the mean time this will do."}

Two months later my girlfriend made me drop it and this time it made the power button and come out to work back to normal as it should. Now I don't have to shove my nail in it to turn it on. I only have a few complaints. 1 it's too big to hold in your hands so buying a stand up case or keyboard(recommended) will be best or just keep it on a flat surface. It's still okay to hold it with both hands while watching videos.\n2 it's not that efficient with WI-FI , some times It streams fast, some times it doesn't. I recommend keeping video quality at 360 unless you should just buy a $50 modem to make your internet faster.\n3 the screen is cheap. You can see the screen.

I previously had a 7\" tablet and first off I didn't realise just how big a difference it would make. In a good way of course. I use Chrome instead of the preloaded browser and find it's faster than the preloaded one. It picks up my home and school wifi really easily and honestly it's good for the simple things I use it for. Because of the size I really suggest getting a keyboard and stand sort of case because it can really have a glare problem (though that is in no way against the tablet itself of course!) Not everything is rainbows. If I were to just carry it around without a case I'm worried I could all but break it in half and the other reviews are right that screen itself could really be better. Mine doesn't have too much of a bubbling problem like some of these seem to so I put a screen protector over it and I'm not worried about it. All and all I'm happy for what I need it for! I'm only put it down to four isn't of five because of the risk the screen can really face in the future."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00S6B0IQ6", "review": "I like this tablet except for a couple of drawbacks:  the first is that it runs out of juice too quickly.  Unlike the iPad or my Best Buy Insignia tablet [which I loved but my husband sat on and cracked] you can't leave the Dragon in \"sleep\" mode.  You have to turn it off entirely when it's not in use.\n\nWhen I have tried to turn it on recently, it's been dead and then when I plug in the battery, I see it's at 0% even though it's technically turned off and I haven't been using it.  So I have figured out that you have to turn it off completely if you want to keep it powered up. I set the sleep mode to turn off after 30 minutes but it still runs out of battery far quicker than any of my other devices.\n\nThe second drawback is that the resolution is not as good when watching YouTube.  My iPad and cracked Insignia...did I mention how it got cracked....:) both have crystal clear pictures on YouTube but the Dragon Touch does not.  It does have good resolution with Amazon Prime and Netflix so I don't know why the interface with YouTube isn't that great.\n\nIt's great for reading my Kindle books and for watching everything but YouTube.  Another good feature is that it gives you notifications from your Facebook page when you turn it on.  It's a good little tablet [especially for the price] but not as good as my other devices."}

Im very disappointed by this product and Im thinking about returning if for the second time.  I had ordered it the first time I had to return it immediately because it had majormechanical issues and simply was not working,  and although I chose to give it a second chance mostly because of the price of the product I have discovered that it does not stay charged Im having trouble with the charger that was provided with the tablet.  It does not fit correctly into its port.  The graphics are horrible.  You can only look at it from an angle.  Do not try to look at it if you are standing up looking down.

NOT what they have in the description. If you are looking for a cheap tablet and don't mind having to buy another if it breaks after 90 days this is probably the one for you, I on the other hand prefer my tablets to work longer than 90days....

Screen image maybe could be crisper, but for a budget tablet, doing basic stuff, its fine.  I like that it comes with screen protector and a plastic sheet protecting the back of the tablet.  That sheet is peeling off around the curved edges of the tablet & that's a minor annoyance.  Photos are decent ... not high high quality, but if you want that, spend the $$$ for a real camera!  I like that it didn't come with a bunch of bloatware on it.\n\nI'm new to using android devices and have had no problems using this one.

I am rough on my tablets (I've been through three this year) and I got tired of spending a fortune on an item I'm probably going to drop, sit on, etc. I've had this tablet long enough now to know it's pro's and cons. First let me say I'm not into games so I have no idea how it is for that. What I do use it for it performs it's job admirably. I've noticed a lot of reviewers state that there is no GPS, but there is in fact a GPS sensor. It is a little strange the way you have to turn it on, but it is there. Navigation is one of the primary things I use the tablet for and by using downloadable maps it works great. I have other dedicated GPS receivers as well as smart phones but nothing beats having a nice sized screen. I also use the tablet to wirelessly control my DSLR and once again it does the job flawlessly. The bottom line is, if you want a tablet that does just about anything you may need to do and don't want to shell out the big bucks this tablet should do the trick for you."}

If you don't and your battery starts dying fast then you have no one to blame but yourself.\n\nNow on to the tablet itself, this is my first tablet and I'm loving it! The screen is big so there is that, runs on kitkat, it's pretty fast, it is very thin and isn't as heavy as other tablets of the same size, and does what I need it to do, socially or work wise with MSO compatible apps. And for the price, it is a very good deal and worth every penny. In addition to the two that I mentioned, I also got one for my dad as a present and he loves his.\n\nThe only complaint I have about it so far is that for whatever reason it does not pick up a wifi signal as well as say my cell phone, but there are ways around that so no big deal.\n\nIf you want a pretty good tablet and a bargain price than you can't go wrong with the Dragon Touch A1X Plus"}

My husband has a Android tablet thats 7 inch, so when I ordered this none, I expected it to be a little bigger but not too much. I absolutely love the size of this tablet! It is as wide as my iPad but not as tall so its not as bulky and fits perfectly on my lap. The widescreen screen is incredible! The graphics are very good and the ease of use is so much easier than I'm used to with my iPad. Downloading apps are lightening fast.  There was a small bubble on the top of the screen which is why I rated 4 stars, but it is on the edge of the tablet so I don't feel its such a problem that I want to return it and wait to get a new one.  I have never seen so many ports in a tablet. I don't know what you get when you spend a lot of money on a tablet but for the price I paid for this one..I got an amazing deal. Highly recommend!"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00S6B0IQ6", "review": "This is a dandy inexpensive tablet!  It's a companion and backup for the Google Nexus 10, which I bought for a lot more three years ago.  So far, the Dragon Touch supports the important apps I've got on the other machine.  It's a real bargain.\n\nMy only major gripe is that the specs and the the so-called 'user manual' (16 tiny pages of usable info) show a separate charging port, while the machine I received has to be charged thru the mini-USB port.  It seems to charge at an OK rate (2 amp), but you can't charge or power the unit while an OTG cable with a thumb drive is attached to the USB port.  So, if you're transferring files to/from USB storage, the battery drains very quickly.\n\nAnother minor spec issue:  The HDMI output port requires a 'mini' HDMI male plug, as opposed to the Nexus, which has a 'micro' HDMI socket.  Don't buy a cable until you get the machine; so you'll be able to fit what you need.\n\nFinally, the Nexus 10 'streams' HD videos from an attached thumb drive thru the HDMI output to a TV without problem, while the Dragon Touch can't keep up, and the video is jittery.  Not a problem if you've got room to copy the video to the Dragon Touch, where it works beautifully, but I'd look for reviews regarding its ability to stream videos from online sites (which I haven't tried)."}

It's a nice companion to have if you're looking for something that allows you to be mobile away from your desktop.  The one thing that I wish was a little better were the speakers.  When it plays music, it's loud.  But on skype it gets a little softer and i found that I had to use a headset with it to be able to hear callers on skype clearly.  Also, the screen seems a little bubbly. I actually thought it still had protective wrapping on it at first and kept trying to see if i had to pull it off.\n\nFor the most part its nice.  It responds fast enough.  I love the size.  There are a few glitches here and there, but those are common in most android products.  In the beginning, it kept registering as not being charged fully when it had actually been charged for the required ten hours when you first receive it.  I had to turn the tablet off then on again to correct this problem.  After the first few charges though, I didn't have this issue again.  All in all, I'm happy with my purchase.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00S6B0IQ6", "review": "I bought this for my mother in February.  She has a medical condition that makes it difficult to use a laptop, so a tablet was just the thing.  At first, she was excited about it, and used it frequently.\n\nOne day, she called me and said the tablet was displaying all sorts of error messages.  Over the phone, I talked her through a factory reset procedure.  That seemed to cure the tablet's problems for a while, but shortly thereafter, she began having problems with it again until it became unusable.\n\nNo problem, I thought.  It clearly says right in the product listing,\"Full 1 YEAR defect warranty! You're covered from any manufacturing defects for 1 year from the puchase of your Dragon Touch A1X Plus.\"\n\nThat was part of the reason that I bought the tablet.\n\nI got the tablet back from her (not trivial, since she lives a considerable distance away) and put it through the reset procedure again.  I used the tablet around the house for browsing and watching video.  Within three days, it was again displaying error messages and crashing.\n\nSo, I contacted Tablet Express to arrange for service.  They walked me through the reset process again, which this time did nothing.  They then told me they would see what they could do for me and \"how much it would cost.\"\n\nI was confused by this.  I argued that the tablet was under warranty. They responded,\n\n\"Our company offer a 30-days refund warranty and a 90-days manufacturer replacement warranty, and a 1 year software defective warranty. Any hardware problem after the 90-days replacement warranty, we can provide you a repair service.\"\n\nWow. No mention of any 90 day warranty on the listing.  Go back and check for yourself. Just that sentence touting a one year \"FULL\" warranty.  I assumed I was covered. I think any reasonable person probably would assume the same.\n\nSo now, they are wanting to charge me to repair the tablet that they sold to me with the suggestion that it had a \"FULL\" one year warranty, because I'm outside of the 90 day warranty that was never mentioned.  And, they made the determination, via email, without ever looking at the tablet, that my problem was not \"software related\", which would be covered under the warranty.\n\nI haven't yet decided what to do, but Tablet Express certainly has me over a barrel.  The tablet is worthless as it stands, and they're not going to cover repairs.  What choice do I have at this point?  I can't even complain to Amazon because the complaint period has closed.\n\nSo, if you're hesitant about buying the Dragon Touch A1X, and that one year warranty is influencing you to take the chance, my advice is to just walk away.  It seems that lots of people got lucky and got a good one, but if you don't, you'll likely be paying out of your own pocket to get it right.\n\nSo disappointing when companies have no idea of how customer service should work and engage in deceptive tactics to lure in buyers.\n\nRead my review for Yourtech headphones if you want to see how customer service should be done.\n\nEDIT - 9-30-15 - It pays to complain.  I called Amazon and pointed out the discrepancy between the advertised warranty period and the actual warranty that you get.  They agreed to accept the tablet in return, sent me a shipping label, and will credit my account once it arrives.\n\nThe headache that Tablet Express caused me is inexcusable, but kudos to Amazon for saving the day."}

I was looking for an inexpensive tablet with HDMI capability. Add a USB and an SD card slot... what's not to love? I've only had it for a day but the screen is pretty responsive. Very happy with this purchase.\n\n8-14-2015 follow up\nI've had it for a couple of weeks now and for the most part still happy with it.  The only minor issue I have is the battery monitor. It doesn't indicate the correct battery percentage. Whatever percentage I charge it to is where the meter stays until it dies. Battery life is decent... would be nice to know when it's about to die. Even added a widget/app but it does the same. Not sure what's up.\n\n09-06-2015 follow up\nBeen pretty happy with it until today. I decided to use if for a class I teach. I arrived at the class and the tablet would not power on. I plugged in the power supply and no response from the tablet. Hooking it up via usb to another pc doesn't even register. Very disappointed.\n\n10-01-15 follow-up\nI'm back. A week or so after it \"died\" I noticed a tiny hole on the side marked \"reset\". Figured it was worth a try but wasn't expecting anything since the unit was dead. Surprise! It's working now and resetting did not return to factory settings (expected to lose everything if the reset worked)."}

It's also powered on, and has a warped screen protector attached, as if this item was used and then sold as new. The camera lens is scratched up and the camera housing broken as well. That's mainly what I'm upset about - I understand things happen in transit, but this packaging was perfect, the box was filled with airpillows and then the internal boxing was also perfect. So I feel that someone returned this item, and no one even bothered to check out the tablet before reselling a returned item as new."}

I'm an active gigging musician and will be using it for sheet music and running drum tracks and also DJing between sets. So far so good. I didn't care for the screen protector as it had a few bubbles and like most screen protectors makes it hard to touch the apps smoothly.

In this case, we don't cover under warranty.\" This directly contradicts the statement on their listing which says: \"Live US local customer service and tech support from TabletExpress. Full 1 YEAR defect warranty! You're covered from any manufacturing defects for 1 year from the purchase of your Dragon Touch A1X Plus. Frequently updated firmware guarantees customer satisfaction.\" TabletExpress are LIARS and THIEVES and will not provide the warranty that they advertise but will take your money.\n\nTo make matters worse my wife's tablet fell not even two feet on to a carpeted floor while in the Tabsuit PU Leather Case that we bought with our tablets and the touch screen shattered like I had dropped it from the top of a building.

I tried calling at various times of the day; they did not answer at all. And to be quite honest, that is where the 5th star went...out the window when I couldn't contact customer support. I would have asked for a replacement but when I call for help, I want someone to pick up the phone. Obviously I need help now, not when it is convenient for you to call me back at your leisure.\nStill, quite an awesome tablet. Seemed to be built very solid. Boots (and reboots) up fast. Easy as pie to set up. Lots of versatility. Excellent WiFi receiver/transmitter (good range). One of the Coolest things was the FM radio!\nI did not get a chance to test Bluetooth pairing and distance. I did not like the sounds when you \"clicked\" things, would love to have changed that.

The sound quality is not only poor but the volume is not audible it is so soft. With other apps the sound is much more reasonable although still poor quality. I would recommend a Bluetooth speaker but that doesn't work with video chat.\nAlso the screen is not as good of quality/clarity as I would have hoped. My Samsung Galaxy s3 phone screen is MUCH nicer.\nAnd you only have two screens to put apps on.\nI guess those are my main complaints.

She has used it for less than 4 days and it is not working!! Of course, I can not return or replace because it has been 34 days even though not used for 30 of those days. She is heart broken! I had high hopes for this tablet and am extremely dissapponinted!! Lesson learned you get what you pay for!!\n\nFirst Review\nI purchased this tablet for my daughters birthday! I am extremely impressed with the speed and capabilities of this tablet! It can do everything that my other daughters nook and my ipad can do for a fraction of the price.  The screen color and sharpness might not be that of the ipad, but the picture is fine for basic use.  The set up was easy and the android system runs smooth.  I am very pleased with the performance of this tablet thus far.  If it continues to work this well as we use it more ie.. downloading movies, music, netflix etc... we will purchase another! The only reason I gave it a 4 is due to a few minor gliches in programming, such as the sounds when striking the keys doesn't seem right and when typing in passwords during initial set up I couldn't see the area in which I was typing and half the letters where there.  I am very please with the product so far and I know my almost 7 year year old is going to be very excited on her birthday!! This is a great buy and you are getting a lot for the price!

The tablets are great when it's in working condition, and meets all expectations of such an inexpensive item. The 1st tablet of 20 tablets (trial/test) to check the features and durability of this tablet (2014 model). Great tablet, so I bought 19 additional tablets to be used to train students on a specific on line program, later found out that the 19 tablets are 2015 models. Problem #1 with the 2015 model, the charging system is faulty. When plugging the AC adaptor, the tablet indicates it's charging, and after a few hours some tablets are fully charged, but some tablets DO NOT TURN ON at all. I changed AC adaptors but no power. I held down the power switch for 15-60 seconds, no power. These were suggestions from the selling company. Amazon allowed me to return each malfunctioning tablet for a full refund. But this continued to happen each time the tablets were charged. I'm very cautious and knowledgeable on plugging in the AC adaptors as I been an android person for many years. Problem #2, 4 of 19 (2015 models) would malfunction when powering up each time, the tablets would display a foreign language which appears to be Korean. Per vendor of these tablets, if you hold down the power button and volume button the tablet will reset itself. In addition, once the tablets are outside of the 90 day warranty, the malfunctioning tablets must be sent to the 3rd party seller at your own expense. I believe the source of these ongoing problems are from the charging system within the tablets. DON'T BUY THE 2015 MODELS"}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00S6B0IQ6", "review": "This tablet is okay for the price. For what I need to use it for, students to check in at my exercise studio, it's just fine.\n  I noticed that the tablet box was not sealed in plastic wrap when I opened the delivery box.  Online reviews clearly show that on arrival, a new dragon tablet should be sealed in plastic.  I'm not sure if this is important or not.\n  I charged the tablet and turned it on. And found that the language was all in Dutch.\n  When I called the tech-support number, it's stated that had a high call volume and could not answer my call, and that I should email them at their tech-support.  As of this point I have not received a response back. Using Google translator from Dutch to English I was able to figure out how to reset my tablet.\n  This takes me back to the beginning of my review where I stated that the product was not completely sealed in plastic when I took it out of the delivery box. Makes me wonder if this had been used by someone else.\n Ok for basic uses.  Doesn't hold a charge well and takes a long time to charge.  For the price works great for my uses. Not comparable to an iPad or kindle fire."}

Games load easily...no issues here.\nBATTERY - I didn't have high expectations but the battery has kept a great charge; I bought a 15ft HDMI cord thinking I would need to leave it plugged into the wall while putting movies on my TV...I streamed 2, two hour movies (4 hours in a row unplugged) and still had 50% battery left. Mind you, I charge my Dragon Touch every night when I go to bed.\nKID FRIENDLY - I have a 9 and 12 year old, the 9 year old complains that the tablet is too big for her to hold and play games well but she still plays on it all the time :)\nSCREEN - The angle viewing was my fear when I purchased this tablet. Here's what you need to know - It has a great angle side to side when holding it sideways; up and down angle isn't great but has not been an issue for us.\nCONNECTIONS - I had no trouble at all with the connectors on this tablet, the micro USB and HDMI are very tight and go in easily but I am careful with EVERY micro-USB device, so be sure to take your time when plugging and unplugging them and they will last.\n\nThis tablet is worth more than the cost in my opinion, I have been showing it to people at my work who were quite impressed, I gladly referred them to this model because of the ability to stream movies and charge at the same time.\n\nAn applause to Dragon Touch for a quality, budget friendly device.\n\nWritten from Springfield MO area."}

I did a lot of research this time and the reviews sold me, I hope this one helps others like those I read.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00S6B0IQ6", "review": "My daughter worked hard on several chores and extra duties to save enough money to spend on a budget tablet.  We decided we would chip in half to get her something nicer.  When we found a 10.1 inch tablet that seemed to get pretty good reviews, we thought we struck gold!  She was so excited!  When it finally arrived, she followed the instructions to charge the tablet for 10 hours.  Imagine the patience of an 11 year old to do that!  Then she finally got to power it on and use it.  Immediately, it had problems.  She had trouble loading games, and the game she loaded would glitch.  It kept giving a couple of error messages about google play.  I tried reading blogs about how to alleviate the problem, and thought maybe it was actually a software problem, so I factory reset it. The next day, my daughter tried using it again.  It froze.  She didn't know about the reset button on the top that you can use to power it off with a pin or tack.  So she waited for the battery to run down, then tried charging again for another 10 hours.  Then we factory reset again, and started over.  This time, I completed the initial steps to set up the tablet, and loaded a few games.  It seemed to work better, but games were still a little glitchy, and they would shut off in the middle of the game, or not start at all.  Tonight, I get home from work, and she shows me her tablet is frozen again.  I reset it.  It freezes again.  WE CAN'T USE THIS THING!!! So frustrating!  So, I told her we're sending it back.  This much frustration for three days with a tablet that freezes more than it functions properly isn't worth it.  My daughter is disappointed.\n\nMaybe this one tablet we received is just a bad unit.  It seems others have had good experiences.  But based on this one tablet, I will never purchase a Dragon Touch, and probably not an off brand tablet at all.  We have had a few budget tablets, and all were far better than this one, but none of them were great.  This is bar far the worst piece of technology I've ever laid my hands on!"}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00S6B0IQ6", "review": "I ordered this a couple days ago, wanting to try out having a Android tablet. This wasn't my first Android product (I have a XiaoMi smartphone) but it was my first DragonTouch tablet. I have to say, for $100, it's pretty great. It runs quite smoothly, and there doesn't seem to be any weird glitches or problems so far. In terms of function, it's working perfectly, and is able to run the games I usually play, such as Clash of Clans. However, my main complain with it is the rather lackluster screen. Sure, it's fine I suppose, but the viewing angle when tilting up and down is horrible. Also, the colors are certainly dry and not exactly eye popping. The resolution isn't the best either. If you can handle the rather unimpressive screen, this is an excellent all-purpose tablet well worth the price."}

So:\n- It's not a $300+ tablet\n- The screen has good color, on the cool side which I prefer.\n- The resolution is acceptable, movies and games look great on it.. Text and icons can look a little fuzzy.\n- Screen is very responsive\n- Viewing angles can be odd. Darker or lighter vs. the angle. You need to be deliberate with the angle you view it at.\n- Fantastic brightness. I use this outside during the day.\n- Battery life is great considering the brightness and size of the screen. Although I always have a portable battery pack to keep it charged up if I'm streaming.\n- Streams perfectly, music and video.\n-WiFi is as strong as my nexus tabs, and it is NOT difficult to get connected as other reviews have stated. This is the normal KitKat WiFi connection setup. KitKat was never good at hoping networks. Always turn WiFi off and back on AFTER switching networks.\n- Bluetooth is kinda weak. Not as much range as my nexus tabs.\n- Audio is pretty good. Exceeded my expectations considering some of the comments. It's louder then my nexus tabs, and it has rear firing speakers. Plenty loud and good quality to watch a movie outside. And of course it's going to sound better with a BT speaker.\n- I think it's slightly under powered, though it runs smooth. Just not 100% of the time. Menus, scrolling, and animations don't lag, they just stutter a bit.\n- Haven't played a ton of games yet. But the ones I have played run fine on it.\n- Cameras, meh. But hey, a $100 10 inch tab has to cost save somewhere. It's got both a front and rear. The rear is decent.\n- HDMI out is nice to have. Works great.\n- Size and weight is nice in the hand, though the plastic case is slick. It's like a Samsung in that respect. Get a case.\n- Haven't added memory to it so can't comment on that.\n- GPS works exactly the same way as my nexus tabs, there has to be a network connection for it to work.\n\nImo, you really can't go wrong at this price. Mine is mostly for media consumption, but I find myself reaching for it more and more. I got it just to use outside... If I drop it, scratch it, who cares it was $100. After using it for a while, I would recommend this unit and I would buy another. The smaller tab would perfect for kids.  Kudos to the tab express guys for getting something of decent function and quality in this price range."}

I must say that I am really happy I did.  This little tablet zips along 10x faster than my TF300 and I can't say I've had any problems with it.\nThe reason it's not a 5 is just because of the display quality.  That's where the TF300 had this one beat.  It's not as crisp as I'd like it to be so reading books on it sometimes requires me to zoom in a little bit more.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00S6B0IQ6", "review": "This is an excellent product, for the price. I have a couple of minor quibbles but this tablet has turned out to be better than expected. I recommend it, as long as you keep in mind you are not buying the latest iPad.\n\nPros: With 1 GB ram it's very fast, 16GB of ram is \"roomy\" and the touch screen is responsive. Watching TV/Movies has been flawless as has downloading and installing programs via a wireless connection. Battery life more than adequate (I'm using Avast battery saver) at, I'm guessing, 6-8 hours of my typical use of playing games, surfing the internet and streaming the occasional TV show.\n\nI also give 5 stars for customer service from TabletExpress (see cons below).\n\nCons: First and foremost the screen \"angle\" can be unforgiving. Tilted correctly the screen resolution is excellent however, moving the tablet around will cause the display to fade somewhat and can be annoying but propped up it's fine. If you plan to wave it around a lot and have several people looking over your shoulder it's probably an issue but for personal use, not so much.\n\nMy major issue came when, after less than two weeks, the mini USB port broke. Obviously I wasn't able to recharge the tablet or do anything else so I contacted TabletExpress. Their response was immediate. I returned the defective tablet (at no cost to me) and received a new replacement in less than a week. I could not have expected a better response. With my new tablet I treat the USB port gingerly and hopefully i won't have a repeat.\n\nImproving the display and more durable ports and it gets the 5th star.\n\nIf you need a inexpensive tablet and are willing to accept the screen shortcomings and treat that USB port gently you'll have a great buy. I don't regret my purchase at all and gladly recommend the Dragon Touch."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00S6B0IQ6", "review": "We decided on this tablet for several reasons and it has preformed as well as we wanted it to. We were looking for something to replace a DVD entertainment system in our SUV. It would be mounted using a suction mount tablet holder suctioned to the dome light. An IR transmitter would feed the audio to IR headphones on the kiddos, leaving the adults in blissful silence! Alternatively the FM adapter can play the audio through the Excursion speakers.\nThe tablet needed to included the following:\n1. less than $100  - technically right at $100 but within the budget.\n2. expandable - yes it does have this capability although it is labeled TF Card. Handled a 32 GB micro SD.\n3. 3.5mm headphone jack  - handled the IR transmitter and the FM adapter both beautifully\n4. 10.1\" - the screen was large enough for kids in the back to easily view the movies. We were a little concerned with viewing angle but we didn't seem to have much issue. The tablet was mounted near the roof. The only problem came when the mount would slip and the tablet would tilt down. Otherwise the viewing angle worked very well for us.\n5. decent battery life - we got 4 full movies at full screen brightness both going to our destination and coming home\n\nWe didn't need a super speedy tablet but this Dragon Touch is surprisingly powerful. It did a good job loading the few apps I put on and surfing web, facebook etc. It seems to be a pretty powerful tablet. We are pleased with it. It came with a screen protector already put on and it does have a few bubbles. But that's very minor in the grand scheme."}

Need to use this tablet in the sun or don't have it centered to your view, it won't work like you want it to.\n2.  The battery is never configured properly.  Cant root the device, or access the android recovery mode (volume+ and power) and be able to fix it.  I will need to contract customer service to see if they have a way.\n\n3.  Cameras are only 2mp capable.  So, using for Skype will work, but not the best picture.\n\nPros:\n1.  Lightining Fast...quad core and works well.\n2.  Affordable, priced under $100.00\n3.  Great 10inch screen\n4.  Ready to go out of the box.\n\nIf you are a \"snob\" in terms on having the best technology with a high price, this is not the tablet for you.

However, this little gem has been able to perform for me very well and I am looking forward to providing more feedback soon. So far, it has been able to help me present documents to clients, view movies both on its 10 inch screen and by attaching it to the TV via HDMI. Very Fast compared to what I had which was a refurbished ASUS.\n\nAs far as packaging and quality, everything came QUICK and CORRECT. I have found no blemishes or mars. I am very happy with my purchase and will likely increase to 5 stars when I update. I especially like the fact that I can charge it by hooking it to my computer. I could not do that before with the ASUS so that is a BIG bonus. I will have to read more to see if the chargers are interchangeable with my droid phone, but I am happy how things are so far!\n\n7/6/15 UPDATE: I was able to charge with my Android Phone Charger so I am very happy about that."}

Sent it back and ordered another thinking I just got a bad one, but the second one I ordered had the same issue. Unfortunately for me this is a deal break because while I could live with the lower screen resolution and bad colors the fact it kept changing the screen when holding it was too much of a distraction. Maybe I was unlucky and just got two bad screens but didn't want to try a 3rd one.\n\nJust an update and I ordered Dragon Touch M10X instead which has a little higher screen resolution.\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00VI2H5FM?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00\n\nThis has all the same features as the other one, but none of the issues with the screen problems I had with the two A1X that I had to return.

I tried plugging the tablet to my computer with the provided micro usb cable and that didn't work, and tried the wall charger that came with the tablet and that didn't work either. Even tried my own micro usb cable to plug it to my computer that I know for sure works, and that didn't work either. Also the battery indicator was stuck at 85% from the moment that I powered the tablet on till the moment it died. Pretty sure something was wrong with the micro usb port on the tablet or the battery itself, either way I am returning this junk and will warn others that they may want to drop more cash on a name brand tablet.\nThe tablet worked great for a few hours, except for the charging problem, until it died with the battery indicator stuck on 85%. You get what you pay for I guess.\nAlso, I tried to call tablet Express many times during the day that I got the tablet and kept getting the same answering machine message to call back later or to send them an email. I sent an email and never heard back from them."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00S6B0IQ6", "review": "This tablet isn't mine its myy mother's, I got it for her for mother's day. Based on the fact that she is rather new to android and it's her first tablet I wanted her use it because she wanted to, not because she felt like she had to because it was an overpriced big brand tablet. That being said, after an initial issue that was resolved, she loves it.\n\nPros: The tablet itsef is a VERY affordable 10 inch tablet that is powerful also. It has expandable memory and supports usb access through an adapter. The quad core processor clocked at 1.3ghz makes multitasking and loading apps a breeze. HDMI output makes connecting the tablet to a tv to watch youtube videoos in the living room a possibility and enjoyable.\n\nCons: The viewing angles are difficult at times due to the fact that they are very limited. The tablet suffers from lower sound quality, this is a real shame since the screen size offered could be used to watch netfix.\n\nSide note: The first unit I recieved was defective and needed to be replaced, not that big of a deal but the time it took to complete the process was far longer than expected.\n\nFinal Thoughts: I believe its well worth the buy. The tablet more than exceeds its price point in value. while its not a tablet you're going to want to use to play the latest games, it will however handle pretty much everything else. I strongly recomend it to people whom want to get started with using a tablet, or a small business owner. It's size, power, and expandability could prove invaluable to a young startup, or a student."}

Everything else was good - it had fast processor, good amount of storage space, the games ran smooth and without issues, and wifi signal was never a problem.

It is obviously designed for use in landscape because when you turn the tablet to the portrait orientation, a slight twist to the right renders the screen completely unreadable. I really can't understand why they would design it like this.  Also, be aware the screen is very wide and not tall. If you're used to traditional ~4:3 ratio tablets (this tablet is ~2:1), this will seem different. I found that the android keyboard will take up most of the screen when typing in landscape.\nReading books and magazines etc is the reason I bought it and because I can't use it for that purpose is the reason for my one star rating. If you never plan on using it in portrait mode, it may be a good deal for you."}

I am no expert but it seems plenty fast enough for our uses -- I mean what do you expect for such a good price?  I like that it has google play installed because it makes it easy to find all kinds of android apps.  I am just about to download the MS Word app.  I got a case with a plug in keyboard and that makes it easy to do work on as well.\n\nI like the big size of the screen and it is good for viewing you tube videos and they seem to load and buffer well.\n\nPersonally, I like the white case and I think this tablet looks like a much more expensive item."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00S6B0IQ6", "review": "I give this five stars because I am looking at this tablet at a price vs performance angle. You wanna compare this to other $99 dollar tablets and start bashing it the list gets really short. But compare it to $200+ dollar tablets and sure, you're gonna have arguments. But remember! You just paid double or even triple what this costs. So you really can't compare the two.\n  I am coming from a Dell Venue 8 tablet. For a reputable company the tablet from dell was just awful. This tablet has been such a stress reliever to use compared to that one. First things first. People, this tablet is only $99. Think about that for a min. The only other competitors I've found in that range for what you get are RCA, NextBook, and maybe Sero. I did  a lot of research and I decided to go with this tablet. So far I am very happy with my purchase. I try to remind myself that I was going for my best \"bang for my buck\" quality. Once again, I only spent $99 on this thing. Anything else close to what this is offering is well over the $200 range. Sure you have the Nook HD+. But have fun with the Barnes and Noble locked down OS, unless you wanna spend the time to root that thing. This comes with KitKat OS right out the box. The setup was way easy and so far it's been flying while I use my apps and stream content on it. For $99 I am pretty pleased so far.\n\nOK the Cons. Like others have mentioned.\n- The resolution is lower than other tablets. I knew that going in and I was willing to sacrifice that for the price.\n- The speakers/sound are not as good as some others. Compared to what? a $200+ dollar tablet? Yes, that's why you just paid double for that tablet. That is the hit you take on price vs. performance and quality. You'll need to think about that(same for the resolution).\n- The overall look and plastic casing is not exactly expensive looking. Yes. This is a cheaper tablet. I personally don't care to much about looks. I go for hardware and performance vs price. This gets the job done very, very well in that area.\n\nAnd that's it so far. I say, \"so far\" because I don't want to state absolutes. Perhaps something will go wrong in the near future. We'll see. But for now I have really enjoyed this tablet for what I paid. I've never heard anyone ever try to compare a Porsche to a Toyota or Honda. That's how I feel about this tablet. Toyota and Honda are reliable and work. But not always pretty or the best performing. That is why a Porsche or other sports car of that caliber will cost you twice as much. It's not hard to understand really. I say go for it if you are looking for the best \"bang for your buck\" tablet. You have a small budget but want the best out of that budget. This is a great option for a budget tablet. Period."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00S6B0IQ6", "review": "I love playing Android games, unfortunately my current smart phone (android 4.4) has a screen (5\") that makes it very difficult for a gaming junkie who started playing in the 80's (C64).  Yes my eyes are old and my fingers numbish...\n\nSo I went on Amazon to price my first Pad - imagine my surprise when I found a Pad with 4x the screen area of my phone for less than $100.  Ordered, waited two days, and it was on the step!  My findings after 4 days!\n\nMeets my primary goal 100% - like playing on a super sized phone!  I can even peck the right letters with the Dragon Touch.\n\nHaven't explored all the features but here are some observations:\n\nPlays games with the same responsiveness as my phone ++++\nScreen visibility is good, sensitive to viewing angle + (for the price actually expected much much worse)\nSet up was easy - no more difficult than on my phone (completed basic startup and e-mail in about 30 mins) ++\nBattery life good ++\nDocumentation shows a non-standard charger, actually has a mini USB!!! (of course I will use the provided charger until warranty period expires) :)  ++\nApp Availability AWESOME! +++\nProductivity - why would I need this?  But I found Polaris Office and it would meet any needs I have -really need a mouse and dedicated keyboard for productivity though.\nCamera is not so great, haven't tried Skype yet because I won't use it for that\nBrowser is actually better than phone - tabs provided like IE ++\nYoutube video is good, you get the resolution you paid for plus a little better +\n1 year warranty, it was less than $100, do I really want to pay for extended - NO\n\nSo down to my only real negative -\nWiFi range is very limited, my wireless router hits 10+ devices throughout my house.  The pad loses connection at about half that range. Since I travel a bunch waiting to see how that affects my hotel stays.  Other than this fact I'd be giving out 5 stars.\n\nBTW - looks good against my wife's fruit pad at 15% of the price!\n\nChuck M.\n\nI will update if I find anything additional"}

I use it almost exclusively as a .pdf and ebook app reader and it does a very fine job on any format out there. Downloads are quick(about 135mb/s on my 150mb/s wireless ntwk.). Wireless range is very good but a little fussy about where you put hands on the unit when downloading (I just lay it down). Screen resolution, processor speed, apps...everything is far above what you would expect at this price point. The unit is very thin and light. I get about 5 hours on a charge (depending on settings) without wifi running. I can't find anything to complain about...my teen age grands like it better than their iPads. Mom picked it up and used it without any questions or prompting-and she hates electronics anything so it's got to get points for intuitive interface and function. Highly recommended.\n\nUPDATE 1JUL15: OK, the first units screen cracked on the edge while I was reading. Used Square Trade Agreement to get another unit. What I got was a GOOGLEIZED version of KitKat that is so annoying and obtrusive that I am just ticked off. What was a 5 star tablet is now a 3 star because of the load all of the Google apps put on the processor and memory. No mention anywhere that this was a revised OS or I would have looked for another vendor. Unless you want Google in all of your business, which I don't, make sure of the OS version loaded on what you are buying. I really liked the tablet with generic android KitKat ver 4.4. Now, it's just another piece of hardware that I will return because it was not as advertised or reload the OS. I am so very disappointed. Revising to 3 stars"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00S6B0IQ6", "review": "I bought Dragon Touch AIX Plus for my wife. It arrived on time and of course reading the comments before I opened it to inspect the contents. The instructions said to charge it for 10 hours for a full charge. Had a full chare in 7 hours. I am not an expert in working tablets, however it was easy to set up and get running and I added all the bells and whistles that I wanted to make life easy and have everything on it I desired. I have seen a lot f comments about the dissatisfaction of this item. Well if you expect a GPS to the toilet and it to brush your teeth, then of course get something else. However I am very happy with it and would recommend it to others. Of course there are always some that come from the factory that are lemons, return it and get another. Like I said I like it and recommend it.\nAlso bought the Tabsuit PU Leather Keyboard Case Cover Stand for Dragon Touch 10.1'' A1X Plus for the cover and keyboard and it fits very well and does a good job also in the protection of the tablet."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00S6B0IQ6", "review": "Not Gene, actually his fiancee(he got it for me).\n\nScreen quality is low, inspection quality is also low, makes me wonder if anyone even inspects these at all.\n\nScreen has bubbles in it, and no this screen thingy is glued on. Cannot remove it. Cannot fix it. Have to take it to a professional or send it back.\n\nI have worked with electronics all my life and I have a problem with anything that gets scratched from touching it in a way it is meant to be touched. Considering this is built and designed around having a touch screen, the pads of my fingers should not scratch it. It is very prudent anyone get a screen protector before you so much as touch the screen at all, if you are a person reading this review looking to buy this tablet. Mine has superficial scratches all across it from simple, light touches its supposed to be made to handle. I would also like to point out, screen covers are also not supposed to get scratches from that, no matter how superficial.\n\nOtherwise, I like it. However, whoever makes this needs to keep design quality in mind, especially with how important the screen is on something that is designed around having a touch screen. Screen protectors are supposed to be optional(there to protect against other things besides the pads of your fingers or a stylus made for it) not necessary because it scratches from simply light touches with the pads of your fingers. It is supposed to take a lot more than that to scratch something. For me, this is a huge issue, because this is a very basic design/manufacturing flaw with a basic part of things, because I cannot stress how necessary screen quality is on something built around the fact you are going to be touching it or using some sort of stylus to be touching it.\n\nAnd if your going to put two of these 'screen covers' on it... it really needs to be done better. Their aren't supposed to be bubbles in it. As it is, we are both irritated that we will have to save up and take it to a professional. Both of us are pretty strict about the care of our electronics. This is after all a household where I grew up building computers and he went to college for computers. Otherwise... yeah. Not amused. I am more than aware how cheap the material it is made out of is and how fragile the design is. I feel almost as if I could break it in half if I put too much pressure on it, and I probably could too. With this thickness, it shouldn't feel like that but I can accept that. We both knew it was a cheap tablet. We expected that at least.\n\nWon't be traveling with it until I get a case for it, I am pretty strict about that and my fiancee is damn near religious with putting his tablet in his case when he isn't using it out once... . I like the bigger screen, its perfect for drawing and doing digital art on it. The only adaption is that most of the apps won't let me use the stylus. The screen barely registers the softest one I have because its smaller and the apps register specifics touches or types of touches. Around the edges no touch registers at all, and some parts of the screen towards the edges only register touch some of the time or partially or simply not at all. If the screen wasn't such an issue I would have called this perfect for doing digital art work and easier(and neater) than carrying around a sketch book or a lap top.\n\n I suppose that has up sides and down sides depending on what you want to use it for, but I feel it is a design flaw when you have tot ouch it but touching it scratches it.\n\nI have tested the tablet in several capacities so it is more than OK for the price otherwise. It has good processing speed, a good amount of memory, and is overall really good for a lot of things, gaming included. If you have the apps for it, I would say yes for multimedia as well(provided your willing to take care of the screen issues either ahead of time or afterwards) I just feel the screen is a big enough issue to dock it that much for, because really on something that is based around having a touch screen that is a pretty big problem. I also feel as if, if I drop it it will shatter. On the up side I am all the more careful with it... however I would not recommend this tablet for children. Too fragile. I know a lot of people let their kids play with the tablets, for this one if you do I would say either watching videos not letting the kid touch it or set it on a flat surface after getting a special case and a screen protector for it, have them lay it flat. What can I say... I believe if you have electronics you should take care of them and if you are going to be letting kids touch this tablet at all, it will need a little extra so it doesn't break the first time its dropped. Always assume kids will drop something, that is the safest way to go for the kid and for whatever they are going to drop, also safer for your wallet too.\n\nAnyway, it is a very good tablet, it simply has some issues with the screen and some cautionary things if you want to hand this to your child to play with.\n\nOtherwise, It is quite a good tablet.\n\n----\n\nEdit, apparently their was a fracture in the glass I did not see under the black. It expanded across the screen, with some smaller ones from the same place it apparently had either when it was shipped or got during shipping. I called around and most places don't fix dragon tablets and it would cost as much as we paid for it to fix it because they want the same rate they would normally charge to fix it even if I get a new screen to fix it, it is a fix minute fix. Our only option is to send it in and hope they replace it with one that doesn't arrive already damaged, the next time I will have to feel for anything I can in that area of the tablet. I had assumed that area was supposed to feel like that and did not realize it wasn't until it cracked as it did.\n\nOne good point I did not mention before is 'app permission'. The tablet lets you manage them, disallow things you don't want as they happen. For instance, my sketch app doesn't need to know my location. It tells me when an app is trying to get into my personal information or things like my location and lets me decide wreather I want it to do that. In america they don't make tablets that do that. I like it, I prefer it. I will endure the excessively fragile screen to have it even though it is a major hardware flaw. The software is also better than most tablets here that don't cost an arm and a leg in price, in other words you don't have to be rich or have saved up a ton of money to get it. It is still quite a price... but most people can afford 99 dollars for something they can keep. I would not recommend it for traveling though, the screen is fragile.\n\nI would also maybe advise amazon stop shipping through the US postal service because the US postal service while some of the mail people are nice... often doesn't know the meaning of the word 'fragile'. Not saying they literally don't know what it means... but the way they sort things and whatnot... often things get banged around so even if it wasn't shipped out broken, it is likely sometimes to arrive broken. So either it wasn't packed right or what... but the customer still wants the tablet or any other product they order unscathed. We were also a bit disappointed that when using paid shipping it arrived almost the same day it would have if we had not paid for shipping.\n\nIt looks as if the only way for us to handle this is to send it back and try to get a new one that doesn't have anything broken.\n\nI will say, the bubbles on the screen have nothing to do with shipping.\n\nI only know because well... if it isn't already broken... I would like for it to arrive as unbroken as I would like them to send. I still don't know how it would have gotten that sort of fracture from shipping though. It seems unlikely it was anything but an error from the company it was received from. Just saying."}

I will switch the cover for her to that one because the keyboard cover that I purchased is not responsive to keystrokes and is not user friendly.\n\nThe 10 inch screen is roomy for watching movies and entertaining her with mahjong apps.\n\nI like the tactile feel of the screen, when zooming in or out. It does not feel fragile.\n\nI like the cameras. Skype would be a convenient option.

Neat! I'm not sure that she will use that much, however.\n\nI like the card expansion slot for memory a lot and wish my Kindle Fire HDX had one, too. The Kindle Fire HDX also lacks an outer facing camera. It does have one facing the user. Kindle has no FM radio capability.\n\nThe A1X-Plus is heavier, but that goes with the larger screen.

It's a great size and seems to work just as well as my Samsung Tab 4, but for a more reasonable price for a young adult. The screen resolution isn't the best but it's more than adequate for casual use; Facebook, gaming, social media stuff, surfing....I even installed Sling TV on it and it works great. I would highly recommend this product to friends looking to buy a tablet for their teenager and for young adults on a budget."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00S6B0IQ6", "review": "Tablet arrived ahead of scheduled and looks great.  Could have used a little better user manual, but after a little stumbling around I was able to pick up on how to find things and find the tablet quite easy to use.  I loaded my premium channels' streaming services and started watching shows.  The screen can be a bit hard to view as it needs to be at a perfect angle, but looks fantastic when you find the sweet spot.  The only downside has been the battery life and thusly costs it a star.  With my usage, even with screen brightness reduced, it appears that the battery will last only 4 or 5 hours at best.  Not bad when you're around charging opportunities, but to use it for watching movies on a day of air travel may prove difficult.\nI would definitely reccomend this tablet just be aware of the battery life and take full advantage of any charging opportunities when out."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00S6B0IQ6", "review": "I have had the a1x plus for a week now and am satisified. My primary use is to stream movies to the tv via the hdmi port from my in-home wireless network. I also like to play with it and not have to worry about destroying a very expensive item. All the other electrical and mechanical components a functioning fine. I have purchesed two other generic tablets over the years and dollar for dollar this one is the best in that regard. Since I can only give it whole star rating I would have to rate it as a 5 star. In truth I would rate it a 4.5 star. This is because it spec'd out as having GPS but it really is only assisted GPS. Also the submenues accessed via the power button in conjunction with the vol+ button giving you access to what I think is a manufacturing menu is all in Chinese. An English translation like the one displayed with the power pwr+vol- would be nice. Even just an online English translation would do. I tried a couple of entries and ended up having to press the reset button which got me out of trouble. I chickened out after that. Yes I would recommend it."}

Screen realestate is good, and clear. Wireless connections and speed is good. Did not come with an excess of bloat ware which is a plus. Battery life is good, ive gotten over 10 hours in a gaming environment. For the money this is an excellent choice. The only thing that prevents it from getting 5 stars from me are two minor flaws. The email app, will not connect to any smpt server.. Had to use alternative email apps. Second, screen sensitivity is a bit off. It takes a substantial press to achieve anything. It feels like you have to hit it to work at times. It does not have an adjustment to increase screen sensitively. That being said, I'd buy this tablet again, its a good buy."}

Also the WiFi speed maxes out at 3.0 mbp where as my phone,desktop, laptop and my Samsung Tablet all clock speeds of 40 MVP +/- 5 on any given internet speed test. But 3.0 mbp is still fast enough to watch most all of the vids I watch.\n It also has a little bit light of a back plate, if you push hard enough would call see your finger prints through the screen. But I fixed that buy buying a tablet cover that works great. Fintie Dragon Touch A1X Plus/ A1X/ A1 10.1\" Case...  99% of that.\n So all in all this is a steal at the $100.00 or so price"}

My other half remarked, \"I think this thing was built on Windows 95,\" which sums it up my experience pretty nicely.\n\nIt crashed twice within the first five minutes of use and then continued to get progressively worse, crashing and freezing, until it would just freeze right after booting. Within a half an hour of opening the box, it was repacked and ready to return to Amazon.\n\nI was really optimistic given all the good reviews, but it appears I received a dud."}

Overall I was pretty impressed considering the low price. However, the past few days the top of the screen (where I get email/app notifications) has become nonresponsive. This morning the screen was black with the Android guy saying \"no command\". I thought my tablet was done for, but I found a forum saying to plug in the charger for a few minutes and then hold the power button down for about a minute. Eventually came back on with all my data still on it. Hoping it will last a few more months and will update my review as needed."}

Sound IS very tin box sounding, but it is OK. that is the only reason I did not give it a 5 star rating.\nThis tablet is actually very nice for the money.  I do a daily Bible study using the Dragon and the large screen is perfect for my aging eyes!!!\nThe ease of moving around took me a day+ to learn but I am not computer savvy and I was used to my Kindle, however once I got used to where to find things all was fine.\nONLY problem I found was my gmail came over with no problems, but my hotmail said I had new messages but I could not see them, I went into settings and for some reason my hotmail was listed as a \"corporate\" account (probably by me??) and once I changed that now my hotmail emails come over just fine!\nI would recommend it for someone who does not require perfect sound, perfect picture and lots of storage.....works great for someone like me\njust wanting to read on a larger screen!!!\nI would really recommend this unit for anyone who wants to read on a larger screen at a reasonable price.\nThe also purchased the case...it is ok too. the battery is great, I read 3-5 hours a day and I recharge it at night.\nI am still searching to find how to keep the screen lit longer, without any use it seems to go dark after maybe 10 minutes? but that is not much of a problem so  I am not rushing to figure out what to do."}

For those used to screen quality of cellphones (or Samsung tablets), this is a budget priced device and you get what you pay for.\n\nI bought this to keep in my kitchen so I wouldn't have cookbooks or printed recipes strewn all over. I didn't want to pay a lot for a tablet that I was planning to use only in the kitchen and this does well for that. I have it mounted under my kitchen cabinet using the highly recommended CTS mount (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00I4I92C2/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). I primarily use the \"Paprika\" app for recipes\n\nThe viewing angle is not great but I am generally looking right at it or can swivel my under counter mount to get the right viewing angle. Again this is a budget priced tablet.\n\nI have not tested the battery life because I plan to leave it plugged in.\n\nBEWARE, this device does not have \"Gorilla Glass\" and will scratch if you aren't careful. I recommend some kind of screen protection.\n\nTablet Express's implementation of Kitkat is a little clunky so I installed the \"GO Launcher\" user interface, which I use on my S4 and the \"Swiftkey Keyboard\" because it has arrow keys to make it easier to navigate when I'm typing.\n\nThe FM radio feature is a bonus. You need headphones plugged in to use as the antenna so it will work but you can have the sound work through either headphones or internal speakers (my choice). I have an old pair of headphones with the earpieces cut off plugged in with the wires taped to the back."}

Don't even try using the tablets speakers and if you have a decent pair of headphones don't go over half volume as the tablet either has no amp or has a terrible one. all in all I would be another one if this one broke but don't expect much from it as far as sound goes.

(only because you can't write a review unless you give the product at least a 1 star rating). I haven't even had this tablet a month and it's dead. Went to turn it on this morning and nothing, nada, zilch. Being an optimist, I was actually going to go for a replacement through Amazon, because I like the way it was set up and I liked the features, but I was not afforded that option; what does that tell you? So, I'm trying another brand and I hope it lasts. I don't want to spend $300 - $500 for a tablet, but we'll see."}

I turned the Tv app. on this tablet, and my godness colors were badly saturated. I had a tablet before , and it was working like a charm, when comparing that to this one. I give this tablet a minus one rating. Do not waste your money at all."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00S6B0IQ6", "review": "I received the Dragon A1X plus quad core tablet ahead of its shipping due date. When I opened the package which was well protected for shipping I was impressed by it construction. It was not flimsy or light weight. It was sturdy. It appears to be well assembled. It was larger than the 8 inch tablet that I had been using and it took awhile to get used to handling it. Also when I assembled it into the keyboard case it appears to be almost like a mini 10 inch laptop which makes it a lot easier to use. My hands are small so using it as a tablet can be difficult when typing or using the touch screen, so I am ordering a hand holder for this unit. It will also be useful when my young friend comes over and wants to use it to play games. He has small hands. It will be easier  for him to play when he has the tablet hand holder. Also when I first turned on the dragon touch it was very easy to set up the system and set up the wi-fi connection to connect to the internet, less then 5 minutes. I gave it a 4 star rating but if it stands the test of time I would raise that to 5 stars based on the price I paid for itbonus point it takes a micro 64 MB memory card for additional storage capacity."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00S6B0IQ6", "review": "So far this tablet is working great except for one issue.  If the table is turned on while still plugged into the wall outlet then the screen is messed up.  There are not any icons it is just green and brown bars over the entire screen.  It then needs to be reset.  If you unplug the tablet then turn it on there is not an issue.\n\nUpdate:  The apps stopped working and reset did not solve the problem.  Returned item."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00S6B0IQ6", "review": "I had to update my review.  The first time I bought this, I got a lemon.  Amazon was AMAZING with the return. They SENT UPS to my HOUES the NEXT BUSINESS DAY & picked it up at no cost.  UPS even printed the return label for me so all I had to do is hand them the box!\n\nAmazon has been blowing my mind lately. The customer service is outstanding!  Way easier than buying it from Walmart or whatnot.  I've had top notch experiences on Amazon for the past 15 yrs.  At Walmart, if you want to return something, you have to wait in line & deal with questionable customer service reps.  Not with Amazon.  So easy & smooth!  No feeling of \"risk\" when I buy on here.  Love it.\n\nNow, aside from that, the Dragon Touch A1X does run pretty fast. The screen resolution is pretty good, but it's a $100 tablet so you can't expect super high res.  Not bad, though.  I like it.  When you play back video, it looks fantastic, though. And I was able to read all the fonts & everything.\n\nScreen is very bright (except used near sunlight).  I bought a $12 keyboard/case that essentially turned my Dragon Touch into a $100 laptop.  Can't complain!\n\nIt's worth noting that the screen only looks good when you look at it from certain ideal angles.  Not a huge deal, but something to consider.  In a way, that's nice for privacy, because if someone looks from over your shoulder or from the side of you, they won't see your screen as well as they would on some other devices!  The screen looks clear looked at straight on when holding it vertically like a smartphone.  And when you put it in the aforementioned optional keyboard case accessory (not included), the angle tends to be ideal & the screen looks great when used in \"laptop\" mode.\n\nThe battery lasts FOREVER.  I swear I've left that thing unplugged for a week at a time without having to charge it.  VERY pleased!!  With my phone, if I don't remember to charge it before I go somewhere, I'm in trouble & have to remember to grab a charger before I leave the house.  Not with the Dragon Touch.  The battery lasts super long.  In fact, I don't think I've ever gotten a \"low battery\" notification since I've owned it.  VERY rare among my devices!!  Love that!!\n\nAlmost all laptops, phones and tablets have terrible sound quality from the built-in speakers.  No exception here.  But you can always connect it to earbuds, headphones, bluetooth speaker or use a Y-cord (Stereo RCA male to 1/8\" male) to plug it into a stereo, to get good sound.  No problem, but just so you know.  Definitely get a speaker, some earbuds/headphones and/or a Y-cord if you want to watch videos or play music on this (or anything else involving a need for good quality sound).\n\nTakeaway?  It's not a Galaxy Tab but for the money, it's a great value.  Honestly, I can't believe you can get a quad core tablet that works this well for this low of a price.  I love it and would recommend it & buy it again.  Very pleased and pleasantly surprised.\n\nAlso, I'm enthralled by Amazon Prime, Amazon's return policy, the lowest prices and best value in the world, plus an amazing customer service experience every time I've called.  Even when you have a problem, they treat you like a king & speak clearly!\n\nI will be an Amazon customer for life, no question.  I hardly go to the store anymore except for groceries or to window shop!!"}

Trying to show someone what is on your screen is pretty much impossible, you have to hand it to them so they can orient the screen to where it can be seen.\n\nWith a different screen this tablet would be a decent deal.\n\nI took a chance here and ordered this as a gift to my Daughter, I felt really bad after watching her trying to use it.

Apparently any app you have running on Android can override the Airplane mode and turn on the WiFi no matter what you want. I found a klik to turn off the Wifi and another klik to turn on airplane mode. No matter which or both of the kliks I engaged that could be overridden instantly by any app that wanted to go online.

All functions worked well and it preformed well.  Honestly this 10\" tablet worked fine.  But it is cheap for a reason.  We own 2 other tablets, a Amazon Kindle and a Asus Memopad 7.  Both have excellent IPS displays.  This one DOES NOT.  It has a TN Panel display.  I found I had to hold it at a certain distance and at a certain angle to see the screen clearly.  This was very frustrating and got old pretty quick.  IF this unit has a quality IPS display, it would be a keeper.  Unfortunately I found it unusable personally so I returned it."}

Viewing off axis was poor.  Sound was poor, but good with earphones.  One bothersome software bug I found unacceptable for my needs was  when you first time boot up the tablet the \"Cast Screen\"  allows you to mirror the tablet on a smart TV.  Very nice, but if you turn off the tablet and then turn it back on it will not reconnect to the TV.  However it would work perfectly if I did a factory reset.  Impractical because you lose all your data and aps.  After multiple emails sent I did finally get an email reply from Tablet Express (communication by telephone was unsuccessful) giving suggestions which did not work.  I returned the tablet."}

First I made sure to give it the 10 hours charge that it needed just to make sure that the battery was good, and it was. Or so I thought, later that day I was playing a game and the thing shuts off on me out of nowhere! I had 100% battery and all of the sudden I didn't. I thought maybe it only happens once until I realized again the battery percentage isn't going down at all, yet it has not died on for a second time today. After it died it pretty much quit playing any game I downloaded without glitching,even the simple ones like Earn to Die 2 didn't work! I had already bought a case too so I won't even open that package! I was thinking maybe to just get a refund and replace it with another, but no way am I taking that chance if this product quit on me only after a day! I'm very disappointed with taking this chance because of the cool company name, I read the reviews and thought oh perfect this is an awesome tablet, truth is this tablet is awful! Don't be fooled by the cool sounding name and the latest sounding tech because it's definitely not the case! The tablet is cheaply made and works horrible."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00S6B0IQ6", "review": "Good budget tablet. The 10.1\" size allows plenty of room to comfortably read and browse online. As an entry-level tablet, you can't go wrong with this price point. I purchased this Dragon Touch to use with my students. The larger screen and portability open up lots of great possibilities.\n\nOne thing I didn't realize is that Adobe Flash is no longer supported by Android, which means no video or games on anything requiring Flash. There are some workarounds to load outdated Flash, but those old versions can be hit-or-miss. The Flash issue is a general one common to all Android devices (so I gather). A couple particulars about my specific Dragon Touch:\n- About the middle of the touch screen, it seems to lose sensitivity, so if you're dragging across the screen, it stops tracking and treats it as if you released whatever you were dragging. This also carries over to the virtual keyboard, as letters in that area can take a few taps to register.\n- Around the edges of the tablet, I can see small air bubbles where the front screen is not fully secured to the body of the tablet.\n\nThe touch screen might get better with time (maybe there was some imperfection on the screen surface that will smooth over with use), and the edges of the front screen don't seem to affect functionality. For the price, I can't complain too much about some manufacturing faults."}

While the screen is not HD, it is still clear and entirely functional. The only problem I have experienced with it is the touch screen got a little too sensitive- to the point where typing on the keypad became a problem because letters that you were not even touching were being picked up by the screen. However, this problem seemed to have rectified itself after rebooting the tablet, and I have not had it come up again since. I would very likely recommend this tablet to my friends, especially for its price point."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00S6B0IQ6", "review": "I know its been said already. If you want a tablet with big time performance, you need to pay big money.  This is not going to keep up with an iPad or Samsung tablet. For $100, its a pretty good deal.\n\nYou get a large screen with good, but not great resolution.  It has two speakers right next to eachother, but I discovered it actually sounds better if you cover one up (I used electrical tape). It uses a micro usb slot for both charging and transferring files. You will also find a micro sd card slot, which the manufacturer says can take up to 32gb cards. There's a 3.5 mm headphone jack and finally a mini hdmi slot. Make sure you get a mini hdmi adapter and not a micro hdmi. It also comes with an AC micro usb charger.\n\nThe tablet performs well streaming video, its a little laggy playing games compared to my kindle fire hd.  Battery life is ok.  I streamed tv shows for about 3 hours from a full charge, and still had 30 or 40%.  The battery indicator is pretty wonky though.  It will drop from 100 to 90 in a few minutes. Then it drops at a pretty slow pace until 48 where it will stay for a long time. After that you have to watch it pretty close.  The battery starts dropping from 48 eventually. It will drop at a faster pace until about 30 percent. At this point, you need to plug it in because the indicator drops like a rock and will hit zero in a few minutes. At least that's what happened, and still happens with mine.\n\nThe biggest problem I have with this tablet is Wifi and bluetooth connectivity.  It takes more effort than it should to connect this to Wifi. The Wifi range is not very good. My house it about 900 square ft, and basically square in shape. My router is in the middle of the house and the tablet has a pretty poor connection anywhere but in the living room.  The bluetooth is even worse. The tablet will lose connection if it is turned the wrong direction or you put a wall or door in between you and the bluetooth device.\n.\nTaking into account these problems, I still love this tablet.  It has Android 4.4.2 Kit Kat. You have full access to the Google Play store. This is a big leg up on my kindle fire hd as the Play Store has many more apps than the Amazon App store. It is pretty light weight and there are plenty of accessories available for it. It comes very nicely packaged in a foam padded box.\n\nOver all, you get a good product for the money. As long as your expectations are reasonable, you shouldn't be disappointed.  If you don't want to drop 400 or 500 dollars, the Dragon Touch A1X Plus is a good cheap alternative."}

I can also only get it to charge at all by basically tapping the charger in place at just the right angle.\n\nBefore this problem, I was very happy with it - for the price it was definitely a good value, I used it pretty much primarily for Netflix and Youtube and was happy with the speed and image quality."}

I consider this well above a budget tablet and would recommend it to anyone looking to purchase a tablet at a low price.\n\nThe only drawback I have found is the Kitkat 4.4.2 operating system does not allow write access to the external SD card.\n\nPrevious purchase:\nI bought this tablet as a replacement for an under-performing RCA tablet.  Start up was simple and within 20 minutes my non-tech wife was up and running.  She will use this tablet mainly for internet browsing and social media, so the requirements are not overly demanding.  With 1GB RAM and 16GB Nand Flash, adding a 32GB micro-SD card was a bit of over-kill, but works good as back up  memory.\n\nAnother thing I noticed is the Dragon Touch A1X was not pre-loaded with excessive unnecessary apps. On previous tablets have required a lot of app clean-up at start up.\n\nThe built-in Bluetooth, GPS, HDMI and Dual Camera are also nice features to have on the tablet.\n\nAlso, after a bad experience with another tablet manufacturer who would not support their product after 30 days, I was happy to see Dragon has a full 1 YEAR defect warranty.\n\nAll-in-all the Dragon Touch A1X 10.1\" Quad Core is a great tablet for the price."}

I found dragon touch and was satisfied by all the reviews. It was working wonderfully for the past few weeks, until the screen cracked from being inside my school back pack and now the whole screen will not work. I am very disappointed because I thought the dragon touch was different than the other lower priced tablets. I am asking for a return and still deciding on whether I want to purchase a dragon touch again."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00S6B0IQ6", "review": "OMG... LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS! now to be 100% honest, I was a little skeptical about getting a 10\" tablet for under a hundred bucks, my co workers have iPads and my hubby has a Samsung Tab. I had purchased the Dragon Touch 8\" tabs for my daughters and they adore them, so I figured I am the ONLY one in my house without a tablet, it was my turn. I got my Tab yesterday and I haven't put it down yet! (I am writing my review on it now!!) the instructions said to chrge it before first use, but it came 100% charged, my battery (over 24 hours later and a ton of usage) is still over 50% charged. my Hubby asked if I wanted to trade tablets!\nNow we all know there are bound to be some issues with a less expensive item... while I stand by my statement that this is a Quality product, I will say that it does have some issues that are to be expected because of the lower price point. When you hold the tablet and press the back, you can see the ripples on the screen. you don't even really have to press the back, just the action of touching the touch screen is enough to press it onto your fingertips on the back of the case to cause the ripples.\nsecond, because the speakers are on the back of the tablet, the sound is not as loud as I would like for it to be on a tablet, but for a $100 Quality piece of technology, I can buy external speakers or figure out how to get the sound amplified.\nthird, and I don't know if this is just because I am used to the speed of my personalized laptop, but it is a little slow in loading pages. I figure I need to learn patience and it isn't dial up slow, just not lightening fast.\nA more positive feature to end this review... the HDMI connection is a TOTAL bonus. my husband likes to review photos on the big screen so not everyone is gathered around a tablet screen so to be able to connect the tablet to the TV is a Great addition.\nalso, I almost forgot, I purchased the 64 gig SD card to increase my holding potential and it doesnt have a single issue with it.\nif you are looking for a Quality tablet at a more than reasonable price, I HIGHLY reccommend this tablet!"}

Was working \"fine\" (well, minus the continued message of 'google-play has stopped working or not responding'; besides, apps freezing up during shows). Used it last night and went to use it after having it plugged in overnight, and no power, nothing on the screen. Seems like it just \"died\". Have no idea what happened. Did nothing to cause it shut off/ fail/ malfunction/ die.  It was a nice convenience, while it lasted.  (Jeez, 3 months? not impressed).  \"You get what you pay for\" is the quote of the day."}

I understand that it is a budget tablet, but if it can't be used, then it is a waste of money at any cost. Maybe I received a defective one. I returned it for a refund. Amazon was great as usual.

A 10.1\" quad processor tablet with Android 4.4, 16GB of storage and 1GB of memory with the ability to expand storage for only $100 is a fantastic deal. You don't need the top tier stuff that cost from $340 to $700 in most cases.\n\nOne thing I like about Android, and this specific tablet is that it uses a standard connector and you can just plug it into your PC and copy data back and forth without having to install any 3rd party software. That is always a plus for me."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00S6B0IQ6", "review": "Okay maybe I was expecting too much.  This has a lot of features for the money but it also has some things which you need to know before you buy it. The one big feature it has which I don't like is the plastic screen.  I removed the screen protector because it shows the slightest scuff marks from just normal use.  Thinking the screen would be glass I removed the screen protector and learned the hard way the plastic screen is not much better than the screen protector.  So it is live with the scuff marks from just normal use or find a screen protector which I can live with. The performance is above average to average.  Expect a slight to a little more than a slight delay after you tap on something before it responds.  Also the screen requires you view it pretty much straight on which I do most of the time so it's not too big of a deal. So as the saying goes you get what you pay for."}

It's fun and portable.  It means much to me for the portability, I don't have to lug my heavy laptop around.  Streaming videos is clear and sharply defined (I use Netflix and Amazon Prime). I can't say much about games, as I only play casual\ngames.\n\nAs for the battery life: I watched 2 episode of \"Bones\" , played a couple of casual games,  Fooled aroud with Play Store and installed a few storage eating apps. Messed around on the web and dealt with some emails. I still had time with my battery if I wanted to do some more stuff on the android.\n\nWhat really got me was the Customer Service at TabletExpress.  They were prompt and are currently helpng me with a technical problem.  They didn't tell me to go to the manufacturer, or give me a go-around.\n\nLike other people who wrote reviews: I also have some screen issues.  Ther are very fine scratches on the screen, don't know if I put them there or the cover I bought did it.\n\n For a budget android this is the place to go and get it.  I recommend it to children and us old folk. (And to anyone in the middle.)"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00S6B0IQ6", "review": "For the price, this is a pretty decent 10.1\" tablet. Simple games run well, and website navigation is smoother than I expected. While its screen resolution of 1024x600 seems rather low, the pixel density is as reasonable as a common 1366x768 monitor when held at a normal distance. The viewing angle does significantly affect visibility, but the low weight makes holding it straight easier than heavier 10+\" tablets, effectively mitigating that problem. Because the touch screen seems to have more friction than others I've used, I suggest using a smooth stylus rather than fingers.\n\nAs this tablet just came in today, I cannot comment on its durability or lifespan."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00S6B0IQ6", "review": "This device is very slow sometimes. I thought it was the sensitivity of the screen that has me tapping things too many times to make them work, but it is the operating system. It does not allow Sandisk Micro SD's to work directly from the package, as all of my other devices will, but this device forces formatting the MSD itself (apparently to Fat 32). (Had to replace the first purchase of a Dragon Touch as that one did not  recognize the MSD.) So, although copying to an MSD from my PC or phone is lightenig quick (1.5gb to an originally formatted MSD out of the package takes seconds), the newly formatted Fat 32 MSD on my PC takes about 13 minutes. So, the time investment copying to accommodate this device is often a nuisance. Therefore, I also cannot effectively run some of the same apps my phone runs, e.g., my phone runs MiltiPic allowing in seconds for me to switch out about 25,000 pictures (some very large) or just have them all rotate automatically, but this device has me limit the size of the picture folder to about 250MB to effectively see them.\n\nThere were plenty of benefits, so I decided to keep it for the price, and am sorry now. It has no problem running ripped HD movies (still works), the sound distributed to speakers/headphones is great (hard connect only now), I used to watch Cox Go apps for CNN, Fox, ESPN, NBCs live app, until it stopped connecting with routers. The wifi feature ony finds my phone now, which turns this into a travel only tablet (if I can call it that any longer) that only burns my data. The FM radio feature is really cool (does not require a web connect). The screen size, vividness of the screen are fine, but big wow with all the other downsides.\n\nFinally Bluetooth deteriorated to nearly nol working. BT initially found only some of the devices my phone easily finds, i.e., I have a device that makes any speakers bluetooth, but this Dragon Touch is the only device I have that will not find it (and this Dragon Touch failed and still fails with several BT devices). So, the GPS feature in conjunction with my phone via Bluetooth worked great for a month. This Dragon Touch used to find my phone with BT and now does not.\n\nTIP: The $12+ keyboard / leathercase that Amazon suggests is a good investment if the device keeps working well for you. Another reviewer shows how the back of the tablet can be sturdier with the keyboard accessory. Until there is a case / board that allows the stand to be adjustable, cant think of a better complementary accessory."}

If you want an affordable tablet to watch YouTube videos or netflix, surf online for news or use in the kitchen when referring to recipes/ use as a PDF/ebook reader, look no further. This nifty cheap tablet delivers. No, it does not have retina display, so watching a movie with a buddy is not ideal (although this is very helpful if you have a nosy airplane seat mate). I doubt that the speakers, while serviceable, would blow anyone away. The camera (both back and front) is nothing to write home about either--useful  so the other party can see you when skyping or using viber, but that's pretty much it.\n\nWhy 4.5 stars?  Because the tablet is responsive, user friendly, relatively sturdy, ships with a screen protector (definitely a must for me), PLUS has Bluetooth (just BT your spotify to your stereo), a mini hdmi connector, AND the option for cheap expandable memory (ha! Take THAT iPad!). And did I mention it is cheap? For the price you can buy another one for your buddy to use, plus memory, and it would still be cheaper than a comparably sized second hand ipad. Battery life is acceptable: with medium usage (random web searches, a few games of agent Alice, and around 2 hours of nonstop ebook reading, I was left with maybe 40% power.\n\n I took away half a star because\n- it occasionally (rare but it happens) freezes on me, but it is nothing that a reboot wouldn't fix\n- the wall charger cable feels flimsy. I've been using my tablet for two months now and it is still fine, but I can see possibly needing to replace it later this year.\n\nOverall, this tablet is a great, inexpensive option for the casual tablet user. If your needs are similar to mine, I definitely recommend getting it."}

Frequently it will not respond to commands, it takes several attempts before it accepts what I am trying to do. After reading the ( pathetically small) user \"manual\" and going thru all the settings options we can not locate a screen calibration option.\nIt does have a focus setting for the camera which is nice, the sound is ok for a tablet, the graphics are good, and the internet connectivity is better than the other tablets we have in the home.  All of these are great, but still not much good if we can't get the screen calibrated to the user."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00S6B0IQ6", "review": "Received this tablet pretty fast, working with it for a while noticed a few things, first of all the sound for typing on it's virtual keys was very loud and annoying, so I ended up turning key sounds off completely, also when using google voice search the initial sound it makes before you talk into the microphone is super high pitched, loud and off-putting, pretty much have to set the volume either to mute or one level above mute before using google voice search feature. Another thing, on the home screen when viewing tablet horizontally, the labels underneath the icons disappear, so if you don't know what the icon stands for, you have to rotate the tablet vertically, this way the labels under icons appear, using an alternative launcher can fix this issue but additional launcher would use extra ram. I also noticed, my old 7\" inch \"Azpen 727 tablet\"  had two volume keys on the task bar (left and right from home button) always visible so it was super easy to control volume, this tablet doesn't have them, another feature that my 7\" Azpen has and this one doesn't is flash player build right into it's stock web browser so you could watch streaming videos right from it's web browser. The viewing angles are just like with any other cheap tablet, best if looked at directly. In radio mode, there is no way to control the volume, you can see the volume line go up and down but it doesn't actually change volume, default volume level for radio is pretty loud, if you are a fan of listening to the radio, you could purchase special headphones with physical volume switch.\nThe thing I did like about this tablet is it that came with pre-installed protective film on front and back and the boot time when powering it on is pretty fast. I've also noticed that when plugging it into charger, i didn't have to initially charge it for 10 hours, the unit was completely charged in under 1 hour because the battery was already at over 80%."}

So far, I have been very impressed with its capabilities, build quality, and overall usefullness.  Wifi works great, display is pretty good for this price point, and battery life isn't all that bad at about 3 hours in mixed use.  I would certainly recommend a case of some sort to protect it, because the shiny case is fairly slippery.  I haven't tried the cameras, but I really don't expect too much from them anyway.

I have an iPad that I use for publishing, graphics, movies, etc...and I wanted a low-cost Android device to use for email and reading articles on my daily commute. At $99, the Dragon Touch seemed perfect..and it was...sort of...at first. Easy to use out if the box, just power it up for 10hours and go! I bought the Tabsuite keyboard to go with it and I was ready to roll.  First issue: it was a bit of a challenge to get wifi working. I used it on Amtrak and wifi available in train stations and even with good signal strength, performance was slow and choppy. Second issue: it died after 3 days! It won't power up even after 24 hrs of charging. I'm so disappointed. It's a good little tablet if the power issue isn't chronic across the entire product line. It doesn't have the speed or performance of an iPad or other high-end Android devices, but that's not what I was looking for. I wanted low-end and I guess I got what I paid for, but I had hoped for at least a year of performance, not 3 days. I'm returning the device and will try another Android...possibly a Dragon Touch phablet . If anyone knows whether or not the power defect is a known issue, I'd like to hear about it!"}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00S6B0IQ6", "review": "After weeks of looking through reviews online, I decided that this tablet would suit my needs as a college student.  It arrived right on time and well packaged.  When I opened the box I was a little disappointed by the build of the device. It doesn't feel sturdy and feels like it could shatter if even slightly mishandled.  The screen looks more like plastic than glass.  I've only had this product for 24 hours so this is my initial impression.\nIs it worth the money?  Somewhat.  While it feels like a flimsy product, it performs quite well.  It handles apps with no problems and plays games just fine.  I have had no WiFi connectivity issues and though I have only 3-4 apps installed, it hasn't frozen on me (yet).\nThat brings me to the biggest let down of this tablet.  The screen.  It has one of the worst screens I've seen on any device (even compared to lcd panels from 20 years ago).  Viewing the tablet head on, it looks like you're staring at a fuzzy hologram of sorts.  It hurts to read any text, and images are distorted.  The upper half of the screen looks whitewashed, and the bottom half is a negative image.  Now if you tilt the screen upwards at an odd angle, it alleviates some of this, but still isn't very clear.  I've found that looking at the tablet upside down (with the auto-rotation turned on), helps a little bit but doesn't fix the problem.  However in portrait mode, forget about it.  The tablet is essentially unusable when held vertically.  Everything looks terribly distorted, and I get a headache after 2 seconds of trying to look at something.\nThis is my first off-brand 10.1 inch tablet, so I'm not sure if the screens are supposed to be this bad.  I previously owned a cheap 7\" tab that had a much better screen, but only lasted a year before it quit.\nAt this point in time I don't plan on returning the tablet, because for my purposes (quick emails and Google searches) it looks bearable.  However if I was a daily user and wanted to watch videos, play games, and surf the web, I would've returned it."}

I'm not a gamer, so I can't speak about the Dragon Touch A1X Plus for that.  I'm on the road with clients a lot and for that I need a tablet that's:  durable, fast (enough) for communications, able to handle business documents -- correspondence, narrative reports, spreadsheets, etc -- Bluetooth enabled and wouldn't cost a fortune.  AND -- and for me this is the biggie -- would allow me to plug in an external drive, such as a thumb drive, so I could have my client files at hand.  This little baby does that -- all of that -- at a price within almost anyone's reach.  Yes, I know that the Surface also lets you plug in an external drive, and yes it comes with the whole Microsoft Office suite. In fact my wife has one.  But it's balky and you have to put up with Microsoft's annoying, infuriating auto-updates when it wants, not when you do!  And it's way more expensive!\n\nThe Dragon Touch is Android based and you have access to a huge array of downloadable -- and often free -- productivity software, so I don't miss the Microsoft products at all.  Plus the Dragon Touch is expandable.\n\nSo, why not 5 stars?  For me, a couple reasons:  The screen could be a little sharper.  And I wish it would have two things the Surface has:  that neat little stand built into the back, and that detachable keyboard that also protects the screen -- just not the one the Surface uses which is crummy.  None of those is a big deal though and don't detract from the excellent qualities of the Dragon Touch!"}

Line only rings and then your asked to leave a message, no matter what time you call."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00S6B0IQ6", "review": "I am very impressed.  This tablet is sturdy, quick, and lightweight.  The screen is HD, very sharp and clear. Although short of state of the art, the screen is more than acceptable.\n\nI only use basic functions of cameras, and the photos I took were sharp and clear.\n\nCharge battery for a full 10 hours before using!  \"Extra long battery life\" is highly rated by external sites, It obviously depends on how you are using it.  Movies and gaming drain a battery much faster than internet browsing or offline work.  I listened to an audiobook for 10 hours and the battery indicator is still about 30% full.\n\nI upgraded the tablet using an Ultra 64 GB MICRO SD XCI card in the side port labeled \"TF card\" (See storage in settings.)  The card required simple reformatting .  Initially the card was not recognized. I pulled additional information by swiping down on the top left corner of the tablet revealing more information and easily completed the reformatting.  Knowledge of an android platform will be helpful.\n\nThe screen is very responsive to a finger touch.  When using a stylus, use gentle pressure.  Even moderate pressure will cause the keyboard to display the alternative keyboard stroke.  For instance, pressing an \"o\" too firmly will display a \"9\".  I discovered this accidentally after some frustration.  Once I developed the proper pressure or just used my fingers, the screen touch performed very well.\n\nI also bought the Tabsuit PU leather keyboard case.  Fits and works very well.  The strap does not have a strong enough magnet to hold it closed, (which is appropriate due to proximity to tablet), a different type of fastener such as velcro would have been better.  It closes like a book and is very acceptable to me, especially for the price.\n\nThere is a slight flaw in the top corner of the tablet's screen; but it does not interfer with viewing, and not worth exchanging.  I'm still having problems with the voice to text function, but it may be operator error.  I'll update this when I figure it out.\n\nI gave this product 5 stars because it far exceeded my expectations for the price, especially with a very inexpensive memory upgrade to an additional 64 GB.  I have casually used several friends much more expensive tablets, and the Dragon Touch A1X competes very favorably."}

I was watching videos on it this afternoon, and finally it beeped asking for a recharge. I plugged it in as usual, and several hours later it was dead. I checked that it was connecting, yes.\n\nLeft it for a while, then tried the power button again. Usually it will show the battery level, but this time nothing. So I went to the kitchen to look for something to reset it with, and in the process to make matters worse, dropped it and cracked the screen (bit stressed that it was not working)\n\nSo why am I giving it a 4 star rating?? Because I decided to give it one more chance and plugged it into another outlet, it worked. Meanwhile other things are sucessfully charging at the previous outlet, so that is puzzling, especially since I had used the first outlet successfully before.\n\nSo I dropped it under stress .. my fault, the screen can be replaced (I found one for $26)."}

The tablet looks nice and feels good, nothing looked cheap on or about the tablet. Except when it comes to actually using the tablet. The main problem is the screen. I have to tap really hard in order to have things happen. So obviously that is where the quality left the tablet. It's ok but now that I know the problem I kinda regret having bought it. One more thing I found worthless. The FM radio app. You need earplug speakers that double as the antenna. The signal on most stations suck. And the stereo is terrible because the earplug input is cheap and not built well. Another reason to skip this tablet because the stereo separation is terrible too and cheap. Beware look elsewhere."}

The Angry Birds telepod does not work with this tablet in which we found out last night.  It does work with my Verizon LG tablet so he uses that for his telepod game.

My son hijacked my other tablet so I decided to get myself a new one and give him his own for his games and videos. The tablets condition was like new. No scratches.. No types of marks or smudges either. One thing that I'm worried about is the back feels very smooth I have a bit of a fear it may fly out of my hand if I'm not careful with it. Otherwise the build is nice. It feels like it was put together nicely. The screen is a bit tricky. I would have given it a 5 star rating but viewing it at certain angles gives the screen a negative appearance. There are some things I really love about this unit.... You can use videos as your wallpaper! It has an HDMI port, micro SD card slot for expansion up to 64gb, the sound quality is very good and quite loud for a budget tablet, also the battery life seems long lasting. I turned it on at about 8:30PM, downloaded a bunch of apps, played a few games and it's only down to 76% 3 and a half hours later. That's pretty darn good considering the brightness is all the way up and WiFi is on. The battery life on this unit is fantastic. I definitely recommend purchasing this particular unit if you're looking for a tablet to purchase. I'll be uploading a video to go with this review here on Amazon tomorrow."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00S6B0IQ6", "review": "Lets address the elephant in the room, the 4 star(would give it a 4.5). It is very smooth, and can cause the tablet to slip out of your hands. Even my rough fingers had trouble gripping it. Make sure to get a great case, best bet is a shield case or something to protect it from spills, and drops.\n4.4.2 KITKAT is the main culprit. This version no longer allows you to saves apps, and games to the SD card, even some of my pictures, and videos wouldn't load from the SD card. These are the two biggest cons.\n\nGAMES & APPS: This tablet played all the free games at peak performance. The exception to this rule are MMO's where server load will dictate your experience, and the 1GB ram will have trouble keeping the game smooth. May have to lower the graphics on some other games as well. Other then that, the apps worked great, you name it it loaded it.\n\nISSUES WITH CERTAIN GAMES AND APPS: The game Kritika seems to have graphic issues, and can cause the tablet to crash and reset. AVAST caused my tablet to experience instability issues, with random reboots,and freezing(CM SECURITY IS RECOMMENDED).\n\nNO BLOATWARE: This tablet comes with all the necessary android bells and whistles, but what you will not find here is 50 + apps preinstalled that no one uses. No more deleting 5 dating apps, and other sponsorware. This makes sure you have optimal room for things you actually want on your tablet.\n\nDESIGN: This is a big tablet standing at 10.1 inches this is big. The border around the screen is almost an inch so the screen looks smaller when compared to the specs. The overall look is very sleek, and stylish. Budget tabs tend to stand out like a sore thumb.  With performance and looks you can feel proud of saying that most people OVERPAID for their tablets.\n\nVERY SENSITIVE: make sure you have a great case to protect the back, as even the slightest touch can cause your fingers to bleed through the back and show up on the screen. This can potentially damage your tablet, so invest in a a case. DO NOT take this lightly.\n\nVIDEO & SOUND: Movies, and TV sound great, the tablet is loud enough to hear without the background music and S.E. from drowning out the movie. That said music is hard to enjoy from the base speaker, so grab some speakers,or headset and you are good. The image quality is god enough, but do not expect true HD picture with stunning color, this is a budget tablet, and the slightest tilt can make the entire picture dark. Best viewed if looking straight at it. This can technically be considered a plus, and it can stop people from eves dropping on your activities.\n\nBLUETOOTH: great for wireless speakers to really enjoy the moment where ever you are\n\nA great Tablet for the price, and does everything the collage student needs it to do. Even the causal tablet user will find this more then enough to get them by on a daily basis."}

I ordered it and was ecstatic when it arrived.  I bought a cover and a keyboard for it.  I let it charge up and the first time I turned it on I could feel the excitement building.  However after 15 minutes I was frustrated.  The touch screen was extremely laggy, and it locked up while scanning the Play store.  I turned the screen off & then on again and it wouldn't do anything.  I set it aside and picked it up a few days later.  After recharging it, it finally came alive again.  It was okay for a couple days, but then it had a complete melt down.  I couldn't get it to turn on or off.  I let the battery die (again) with the hopes that it would charge and turn back on.  Nope, nothing.  I tried resetting it and it begins to come on, I see the dragon logo then \"android\" appears, then disappears, then appears and repeats like that until the battery dies again.\n\nI read a LOT of the reviews and have been searching for a little while now.

The screen  and resolution seem fine. I read a lot of reviews of the screen needing to be tilted properly to get good resolution. I have not noticed this being too extreme, at least not bad enough where I would want to return this. Even my old macbook from 2008 had an awkward clarity if I didn't adjust the angle of the screen when in use. I'd say even  with the terrible sound quality, this is a great buy for the price. I hate windows and can't afford a Mac at the present, so this works out perfect for me, especially with the keyboard case that I ordered with it.

The front and rear cameras take ok pictures, if your looking for a tablet that takes great pictures than this may not be the tablet for you but you can always transfer your pictures from your digital camera, or whatever you have that has that option, onto the tablet. Actually, I did enjoy playing around with the cameras' editing option with my pictures I transferred.

I had high hopes after reading many reviews and seeing the 4 star rating on amazon. However, there are just too many things wrong with this tablet for me to keep it. I charged the tablet for 10 hours before first use as recommended, upon powering the device on it said the battery had no charge! I had to charge it for an additional 5 hours before I got to play around with it. Right upon boot up, I noticed it was not a new device! It had Eastern set time and other settings set up from the previous owner. That irked me alot, as I paid for a new device not a returned one. On with the functionality and user options...\n\nWi-Fi has awful range. I was literally in my bedroom right next to our other bedroom with the router and I could not get a solid wi-fi connection from less then 10 ft away. However, after resetting the tablet to factory settings I was able to get the wi-fi to work from my bedroom. Walking over another 5 ft to my bathroom or another 10 to my living room and it would lose connection right away. BUMMER! I will list the other problems/dislikes I've had with this tablet.\n\n1. Camera is horrible. you can't angle it at all and see what you are taking a picture of, it has to be directly in your view to see anything.\n2. The viewing angles of the screen are horrid, even looking directly at it there seems to be trouble viewing the screen. The pixels are bland, graniy, and just look straight blotchy (along with videos i.e. movies, youtube, wshh, etc).\n3. Internet is terribly slow. Checking my email has delays going from email to email.\n4. When holding the tablet you can see your fingers on the backside holding the tablet through the screen on the front, BIG NO, NO!\n5. Lack of display configuration (literally can only change the brightness, that's it!)\n\nI cannot understand how people said this tablet has a nice screen. Unless mine had damaged pixels from the previous owner I don't see how the quality of this screen is acceptable on any grounds. It looks so grainy and dull I would go blind from daily use of this tablet. I wanted an entry level 10\" tablet for a decent price that I could eventually give to my daughter for her first tablet, but I wouldn't even give this to her. I really wanted to like this tablet but because of all the problems I have with it, it will be getting sent back. Looks like I have to shell out an extra $100 for a Samsung Tab 4.\n\nI would not spend your hard earned dollars on this tablet, instead shell out an extra $50-$100 and get something else.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00S6B0IQ6", "review": "I recently received a $100 Amazon gift card for Christmas 2014 from my sister, and though I really didn't need or want anything, I eventually used the card for purchase of this, as I couldn't think of anything else at the time.  I had never had a tablet but doing some research in my leisure to use this gift, I finally settled upon this product.  I have an aging, but still powerful computer, in addition to a Roku and an Ouya gaming/media device, but before using my sis's gift card, I really hadn't thought of any personal need for a \"tablet.\"  While that 'need\" or lack of one, may still be true, I finally used the gift card and amount to purchase this, and I really couldn't be happier.\n\nThere are so many \"tablets\" out there, including the (to me) overpriced Apple ones, to the cheapest of the cheap, but I figured, if one is to spend around $100, more or less, for a tablet, might as well get the most bang for the buck.  And, this is it.  Basically, you're not going to find any 10.1 inch good tablet for this price, with all of its features, anywhere out there.  You won't find it on the net.  You won't find it on any of the home-shopping channels (ahem, rip off) and you won't find it anywhere on Amazon as well.  For the money, this is the best, I repeat, BEST, 10.1 inch tablet available, feature and spec-wise, at the time of this review, you're going to find.\n\nI have never had a tablet/computer before I purchased this (thanks sister), but I have always wanted one.  Not so much for what such things could do, but because it was just one of those tech devices I had always looked at to buy, but never saw the value for the money I was looking for.  So, I waited.  Seems till now, the features and power of such a tablet. as this, was either always outside of my price range, or offered the features which I never considered worth the price.\n\nTrying to use that gift card for a tablet, I finally settled on this, but overall, after using the thing for a few months, I have to say that this was a really smart buy, and this basically does almost everything any other brand of tablet can do, at a more than competitive price.\n\nSo, what's good and bad about this item, and why should you buy it?  First, it has a lot of power.  This is a quad-core tablet, not a dual or single core one.  That means super fast performance.  Second, this has 16G of internal storage (expandable).  Third, this comes with the Google Play store (for Android apps) already pre-installed.  Just set up a Google G-mail account and set up a G-wallet account, and you're good to go for downloading and installing a ton of apps and games and e-books, most of which are free, with no strings attached.  Fourth. it has a mini-HDMI connection (with adaptor cord supplied), which means that you can easily connect this to any large screen TV for hi-def playback.  Finally, but not last, you can expand the memory very easily with a simple SD card, increasing the on-board memory capabilities.\n\nThere is a front-facing, and back facing camera function.  Which means you can use this to not only take photos and video, but use it as a Skype device, for 2-way video communications and conferencing..  Granted, the camera functions on this are not the highest quality, which only much more expensive units might handle, but for general purposes, this is more than sufficient for most uses.  And while the audio features of this are a bit lacking, again, for the price, you really can't go wrong in buying this.  Overall, and I must stress this point, you get what you pay for here, and for a starter tablet, with virtually all the most common desired features of a tablet, this is really a steal for the price.\n\nI suggest anyone who is looking for a great quality 10.1 inch tablet to seriously consider purchasing this.  I only touched upon some of the great features and capabilities.  I had some problems setting up the Wi-Fi with this, but those were quickly resolved, especially with the Wi-Fi connectivity apps available on the Google play store, all free, which make resolving any such issues an easy fix.  Overall, after getting through some initial problems in setting this up to satisfaction, I can't emphasis enough how much of a bargain this is.  Don't spend more than you need to with your initial \"tablet\" experience.  This particular product is the best value for the money you can buy, and I, without any hesitation after much use, can't recommend it more if you're looking for a 10.1 inch tablet with the most desired and needed \"tablet\" configurations.\n\nThe display resolution on this is not that great, considering that available on tablets costing much more than this.  But if you simply can't afford those pricier units for that factor alone, and if you're looking for a really great \"starter\" tablet experience, with all the basics and most desired features, look no further on Amazon or anywhere else.  Bang for the buck, this is the best 10.1 inch tablet you can buy, period..."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00S6B0IQ6", "review": "I don't consider myself a \"techie snob\", but I could not deal with the screen resolution on this tablet (1024 x 600). For me, images and videos were fine, but trying to read text on webpages or anywhere on the screen was a real problem. It's not that my eyes are bad, it's that you can see the individual pixels quite easily in text as well as the notifications bar across the top of the tablet. And if a webpage has a lot of smaller text, then the pixels become so obvious in the letters that you cannot even read some of the very small text (that would be no problem with a smartphone or any other device I can remember ever using). For me, this ruins the entire experience and makes the tablet seem far cheaper than even the $100 selling price at the time of my writing this.\n\nRelated to this is the viewing angle... I knew this was an issue for some people, but I did not think it would bother me much. I figured it might even keep people from reading over my shoulder on a plane, lol. BUT, there was something very odd about the 'viewing angles' on this tablet that was so bad, I've never seen anything like it. There really was no angle that looked correct to me - everything seemed too light or too dark or too \"off\" to my eyes somewhere on the screen no matter how I tilted the tablet. The stock wallpaper image on the desktop with which the tablet ships did not do it any favors. If anything, the silver, reflective balls and red and white colors on the wallpaper just highlighted how bad the images looked from almost any angle. Again, though, I thought that most pictures and videos I watched actually looked OK, but there were some things that made the poor viewing angles (or any \"viewing\" at all) really noticeable.\n\nAs another reviewer pointed out, you can also make the screen discolor and deform by pressing anywhere on the backside. I did not have to press very hard at all to make the screen show these 'anomalies'. This actually didn't bother me much, but maybe it would be a problem for some users.\n\nSome other things I didn't care for:\n\n1. I emailed the company's US support about an admittedly tricky issue that the manufacturer maybe couldn't have helped, but I did not receive a response - nothing to even say \"we're sorry but we can't help you\". So I have to wonder about support in general.\n\n2. The \"back/home/open apps\" touch controls are located at the bottom of the screen as part of the software - not part of the hardware or bezel of the tablet itself - and on a lot of webpages, I thought this took away valuable real estate. On landscape mode, these controls are a full 1 cm or nearly a full half inch thick. And when you take away the useable space across the top that most apps use up, you are left with surprisingly little actual, viewable space (again, on landscape, at least). I know that other phones and tablets probably do this as well, but I thought I'd mention it as it's the first time I can remember having to deal with it.\n\n3. There was an unnamed internet browser installed as default (not Chrome) that I've never seen before and that I could not seem to be able to uninstall. It's not a big deal, but I wondered if this extra software might be causing some browsing problems related to...\n\n4. Chrome, Firefox, and Dolphin browsers (I tried them all) seemed a little \"jerky\" at times.\n\n5. My tablet came with a screen protector already installed, and they leave it to you to peel off the outer layer, which is nice. However, there was a big piece of lint trapped underneath in one location, and air bubbles in several (around 5) other locations and I did not feel this was acceptable. In my experience, screen protectors can be incredibly difficult to apply without problems, but that's me, and the manufacturer should have a clean room and be able to do a much better job than I can. I was pretty sure that this was worse than what I could have done myself, but I still didn't want to risk it by redoing it - had I decided to keep the tablet...\n\nI decided to pay the $9.50 or so to return this tablet. I would have been constantly aggravated by it. On the plus side, I will add that battery life seemed fine. I used it off and on for a few days, watching maybe 30 - 60 minutes of videos, downloading numerous apps, checking email, and browsing webpages off and on for several days, and the battery only dropped to around 60%. I'm not saying this tablet has a great battery life, and maybe I didn't use it as much as I thought, but it's not as bad as I read (somewhere I thought I read that it has a 2 - 3 hour battery life. Maybe I misread, but battery life seems to be much higher than that).\n\nSo, I would avoid this tablet if you even suspect that the things I mentioned might bug you. I give the manufacturer credit for building a functional, low-cost Android tablet, but I can't deal with it, lol. I do have a suggestion for a different tablet with better screen resolution. The same company, actually, makes/sells another Dragon tablet called \"Dragon Touch M10X 10.1'' Quad Core Google Android Tablet PC... HD Screen 1366x768 Display...\" for $140. This is a different model that was apparently released on March 2, 2015 with a better screen resolution. I haven't had a chance to try it out yet, but I did order one... fingers crossed. Personally, I'm looking for something like this because I just can't justify spending $300+ on a Samsung or Apple when all I really want is a decent \"toy\" to check email, websites, and videos. Like I said, fingers crossed that this other tablet will hit the sweet spot of \"cheaper\" price but with a useable screen - for me, at least.\n\nI hope this review is helpful and saves some people some disappointments and/or hassles."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00S6B0IQ6", "review": "Tablet arrived extremely quickly and have not had a problem with it in the month that I've owned it. It is easy to use and runs surprisingly fast! Not to mention, the battery life on this is amazing! I was a bit skeptical considering the price, but I've been pleasantly surprised. Unlike other products that claim you'll get so many gb (yet do not factor in the space required for running the actual product processor/etc.), this one legitimately has 16 gb. All the apps play smoothly and it is super nice to have such a low costing tablet have Google Play store on it.\n\nHowever, I do feel obligated to point out there are a couple issues with the tablet that may bother other individuals. One issue is the speakers are placed on the back of the tablet rather than lining the sides of it. This causes a slight distortion to the sound if you hold it upright or lay it on a table, which that happens to bug me a lot. However, you can resolve this problem by just using earphones (they sound excellent with this tablet). Also, when personalizing the tablet (this seems to be a problem with just the recent Android update because I have a family member who bought a different tablet with Android 4.4.2 and it illustrated the same issue) is when you try to put a wallpaper on it, it automatically wants to zoom in even if you have edited it to fit the screen. This is problematic and slightly irritating because it zooms in way too much that it distorts pictures. I personally like to have certain wallpapers to fit like I would like them and not look pixelated. However, you could get used to it eventually or find certain pictures that don't look too bad with the \"extreme zoom.\"\n\nDespite those two problems, which of course you can completely live with them (especially for this price!), I am extremely happy with this purchase and definitely recommend this if you are looking for a fast and efficient tablet for a good price!"}

It shipped with Kit Kat, the latest Android OS, and which is very fast and easy to use.\n\nI read some reviews about how the back warps the image if pressed too hard, but I couldn't reproduce that, even when pressing pretty hard on it to see if it would. Perhaps Dragon Touch has improved the back, making it stronger, but in any case, it's not a problem for me. My wife loves it, and so far, she's had no problems at all.

It was meant to be paired with a Ring Video Doorbell and neither has worked very well.  Its slow (its supposed to be a quad core?) with almost no RAM.  But the primary problem is that it doesn't integrate with the Ring Doorbell well at all.  And sadly, Ring appears to know this.  One of their techs said I should really return this and spend an additional $300 to $400 to buy an Apple product as they apparently work seamlessly.  Great, thanks for letting me know after the fact.  :(\n\nOne other real problem with this \"system\" (and I do use the term very loosely) is that it only comes with USB power.  Maybe thats OK for others but it doesn't work for our needs.  If the Ring \"system\" is to work correctly then my understanding is the video portion needs to be powered most of the time.  We don't want the machine powering down when someone comes to the door.  We need it running all the time (which is fine with us as long as the \"system\" works.  The system also came with a keyboard which is pretty handy for an elderly woman with severe arthritis in her hands.  But, the keyboard and the power need the same USB port.  So the keyboard under the current \"system\" is worthless and a waste of money.\n\nNow, I did order a power supply and it finally got here after about three weeks.  Tried to hook it up a little while ago only to find its too small for the power port.  Another piece of junk which will have to be sent back.\n\nSo this thing may be OK for the young but not those trying to protect and assist their parents.  It just doesn't work and is a complete waste of time and money.  Better to spend the funds on wired products for now.  Maybe this stuff will work in the future but it doesn't now.\n\nBtw, this may sound like the rant of someone with no experience in the field whatsoever.  That would be incorrect.  My mother knows nothing of this stuff but I've actually been working on PC's for close to 30 years now.  This experience with Ring and this Tablet reminds me of the bad old DOS days."}

Worst experience I have ever had on Amazon.\n\nOriginal Review\nThe audio is not great, nor the resolution. My biggest disappointment is that the screen is not sensitive enough. I have to tap too hard on the screen and it puts a strain on my hands (arthritis/fibromyalgia).The camera is terrible, but I knew that going in and don't care because my phone takes amazing photos.  Video is fine and web sites load quickly. It is fast, and I have no loading problems. I guess I can't have it all for $120. :)"}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00S6B0IQ6", "review": "I had to replace the first one right away, because there was a half inch strip on the lower poortion of the screen that would not respond to any touch. Once I got the relpacement everything worked.\nThe quality of the rear facing camera is just as bad the front-facing cam. The quality of both are not very good at all.\nI installed a plethera of applications that I had on my phone onto the tablet, and have not found the tablet lagging at all.\nThe image quality is decent, though I would like to draw concern to it being like very old smartphones. If you are not looking at the screen at just the right angle, then you will miss some of the lighter details of the image and vice versa. Don't get me wrong, it does have High Definition (HD) though.\nThe sensitivity of the screen is a little tough... sometimes you need to put a lot of pressure down on the screen in order for it to register your touch, or you just barely graze the screen. I have not found the screen sensitivity options yet, if they exist.\n\nI think the only difference between the Android 4.4.4 and the 4.4.2 is the 4.4.2 will not remember exactly where you are in an application if you were to leave the App and then return to the App. It will start the application all over. Like if you are playing Candy Crush, and you get a text. When you leave Candy Crush to text and return to Candy Crush the App needs to reload from the beginning. this is only true for large applications."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00S6B0IQ6", "review": "Bought this to upgrade from an 8\" $99 tablet (from another retailer), just for the larger size screen. At $99, this one beats all heck out of my \"old\" one, which was decent enough for the price. Most of my tablet use involves multitasking while sitting watching TV, surfing the web, looking up the spoilers for the horror and thriller flicks I favor, not a heavy-duty tablet user, though this one seems to have a ton of quality for the price. My 8\" tablet worked pretty well, but had some noticeable performance lag, which this one does not. It's as responsive as my desktop PC, sound is OK, and features are tremendous for this price point. It holds my Wi-Fi signal exceptionally well, though, as others have recommended, I do need to get a screen protector. I doubt that the other, $149 A1X, sold here is worth the extra $50 just for a slightly newer Android version. When you're looking in this price range, I recommend this boy instead.\n\nPluses:\n- screen size for the price\n- very responsive\n- decent sound\n- expandable SD memory\n- surprisingly high combo of features, build quality, tremendous bargain unless you have an extra $200-$300 to throw on a 10\" tablet\n\nCon:\n- screen is flawed a bit by the small viewing angle; if you're looking at it from straight on, pic is fine, but stray to much of an angle, picture quality degrades quickly\n\nI was shopping at a famous retailer last week, and found a very nice leather 10\" portfolio with a detachable Bluetooth keyboard on clearance for $50. So now I have a \"poor man's 10\" laptop\" for just $150. Very nice, lucky catch! But I'd also ordered, with this tablet, a $12.99 leather-like case, which fit this tablet like a glove, and is a nice addition to the tablet by itself."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00S6B0IQ6", "review": "TL;DR: Budget tablet at great price, but while you get a large tablet with decent performance, you give up a nice screen (horrible viewing angle) and poor quality/finish (plastic backing, awful camera/speakers and headphone/AUX jack doesn't work). 3 stars = It's ok for the price\n\nAfter playing with this over the weekend, I feel like I can write a solid review. The Good: First off, the price beats anything around it ($109 or $119 if you waited too long) and is >50% less than the Galaxy Tab 4 at this point. So with that in mind I was expecting a tablet with roughly half the capacity of the Galaxy. I was pleasantly surprised with the performance. While this quad-core CPU won't beat an iPad or other high-end tablets, I had very little lag watching HD movies (720p or 1080p) or loading the large .pdf textbooks. I also streamed Netflix, which lagged a bit, but that may be more due to my spotty WIFI, so we'll just ignore that for now. It also has access to the Google Play store and its many awesome apps (which is why I bought it over the Kindle HDX). Finally, it has a great selection of input/outputs like microSD capacity, micro-usb, micro-hdmi slots.\n\nNow for the reasons why it only got 3 stars. I bought this to watch movies on during flights and also so I wouldn't have to lug around 10 huge textbooks to my clinical internship. As a book-reader it performs ok as long as you use a high-contrast background, but for watching movies it is sub-par due to the horrible viewing angle. I am watching House of Cards right now on it as I write this on my laptop, but can only make out what is  going on when the tablet is tilted 25-50 degrees in landscape orientation (I measured using a goniometer, it's even worse in portrait orientation). This was hardly noticeable when I initially was testing it out since I had it propped up in a new case at 45 degrees, so if you are only going to use this tablet on a large desk that you can move it back and forth to find the optimal viewing angle, it's fine. But for the vast majority of people that want to use it to some other capacity ie. watch movies in bed, on a plane, take notes in class etc. it simply falls short. I find I have to prop it up with my knees in bed or keep  my wrists constantly flexed which gets annoying real quick. Another sub-par feature is the camera. To be honest the allegedly \"5MP\" back-facing camera is pretty much unusable unless you are okay with circa-1999 picture quality. I won't even address the 2MP front-facing camera, hopefully you have another computer to Skype with.\n\nAnother strike against this tablet is the speakers. They are tinny with low volume capacity, but I really wouldn't care very much about the speakers since I usually just plug in my headphones anyways... but the headphone/AUX jack does not work! This is the largest strike against this tablet! I have plugged in three completely different headphones in and none of them work, all you get is the background audio track with garbled dialogue. I tested it with different tv shows, videos, netflix, itunes etc. The only way you can get them to work is to unplug them slightly, whereupon one ear will work great, and then both ears will work great and you almost forget how frustratingly annoying it is until you move or shift posture just the tiniest bit...and then only one ear will work. My girlfriend bought the exact same tablet and is having the exact problems mentioned above. Maybe we both got lemons...but not likely. This may prove to be the deal breaker for me since watching movies and being able to read a book without keeping it at a specific angle are why I bought the tablet.\n\nConclusion: if you want a cheap table that has decent performance, access to Google Play, upgradable microSD and lots of inputs/outputs, but also has a bad screen and viewing angle, awful speakers, horrible camera and a non-working headphone/AUX jack...then this is the tablet for you!"}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00S6B0IQ6", "review": "I would like to begin that it takes me a lot to leave a poor review. I often believe that if there is something wrong I must have done it and work hard to resolve it. That is also why I am very careful to avoid mishaps. For this product, the Dragon Touch A1X Plus I have done all that can be done.\n\nI would like to begin with the pros:\n\n+Conveniently priced\n+Nice Logo\n+Able to connect to the USB tablet keyboard that did not work with my previous Acer A500.\n\nThat is all for that. I purchased this tablet because my A500 finally sputtered out after years of loyalty. While it had become difficult in its dying days, primarily shutting off randomly, it still performed beautifully. Nice sound, picture, and still compatible with many applications with a decent processor. But it's gone and I needed a new one for my mother-in-law. She only surfed the net, played solitaire and tetris, and listened to soothing music. How strong of a tablet could I actually need?\n\nI knew already that the Dragon Touch was an off brand tablet, but the reviews were amazingly high for ssuch a decent price. I already know of the customer service ideal that every one negative review is about ten people who did not say anything, but even the math didn't add up to make it a bad product. I did note the most frequent complaints:\n\n- Lagging screen\n- Freezing\n- Random shut offs\n- Cheap casing\n- Awkward navigation\n\nI purchased it and when it arrived we plug it up right away as per the instructions. When it was appropriate we tuned it on and began. The initial set up was like every Android Device. Once that was said and done we handed her the device. It did annoy me that the Menu, Home, and Back keys were on screen navigation rather than case buttons. The picture was bright but noticeably grainy and immediately the lag as detected. The case was just as cheap as described. Lightly preessing the back showed feedback in the front. Because we were immediately putting it in a case we ignored this factor.\n\nIn about a day we noticed the connectin problems. My mother-in-law loves listening to calming music early in the morning and instead of having to click constantly on youtube to keep a playlist going we suggested Pandora. Well, it took nearly an hour to download. Initially, it could not find the network which was weird that every other device was connected. I set it airplane mode, then off. I turned off the wifi, than back on. Reset up her configuration, even shut it off and on!\n\nThis became an on and off problem throughout the passing month. Normal stylus with the rubber tip also had difficulty being detected. Pressing uncomfortably hard each time was the only way it would register. Because fine tip stylus are in short supply for android (and I actively use my Jot Pro for art) she simply abandoned the stylus. Even that was bareably.\n\nThen came the freezing. Some apps simply froze the device and it would hang for ages before it shut off. Sometimes it would need to be forced off. This became a regular thing. Also, often it took long holds of the power button for it come on. Even several tries. The process became a guessing game of when it would finally come on, stay on, and work properly. I felt terrible that I had gotten this for her and she was forced to suffice with this tempermental paperweight.\n\nSo, it has come to this point that I must give up another hundred to two for a undeinably better product. I guess the tablet market is not like laptops. When shopping for laptops if you really do only the most basic things there is decent laptop for you at a decent price. Beware of this. I might even switch to a Windows 2 in 1 so she can avoid this issue altogether."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00S6B0IQ6", "review": "I was excited when I got it because I received it a day early, so shipping was really fast. The tablet looked really nice when I opened it, BUT it has a lot of downfalls that I wasn't really expecting. My biggest problem that is so hard for me to overlook is the sound quality. The sound quality is horrible. You can barely hear anything, and it sounds like the voices are muffled. It's even worse when you plug in your headphones. You hear the music, but any background voices to movies sound so far off into the distance. Anyway, that was my first problem. My other problem is that on some sites like FB or other images I look at on the net, aren't crisp and clear. It's annoying. That, and if you see an image you like on google, for some reason it will not save the file even after I click save image. I have to go on my phone, send the image to my e-mail, open the image in my e-mail on the tablet, and then save the image that way. All I wanted was a simple wallpaper image. It said something about playing 3D games....I couldn't tell. I downloaded 3D games from google play, and they were not 3D.\nI mean, I did spend 100 bucks on it, so you get what you pay for. The price originally said 300. I can see it being worth 100 bucks.....maybe, but I don't see how it was ever 300. I feel like the price was jacked up and then put on \"sale\" to make people think they were getting a good deal. This was a crappy buy on my end. My cheap straight talk phone that I got from walmart is much better quality than this tablet. Anyway, if anything, it is really nice for reading my comics and manga. The size is the only decent thing about it. That and I can carry it around a lot more easier than my laptop, but if I ever lost or broke this thing....I wouldn't be sad. I'm only sad at the money I wasted on it."}

The keyboard isn't great, you have to tap with force to get keys to respond. These are problems with the very basics of the tablet, so I hate to see what happens with something more advanced. If you want the tablet for good picture or ease of typing, I suggest spending a little more and getting a great tablet."}

Mine came fully charged so it was ready to go right out of the box. Comes with its own protective clear screen cover that can be removed. Connects easily to PC to transfer music/pictures etc. The battery last longer than my new HP laptop does! This Dragon Touch A1X Plus battery lasts me an average of a day and a half sometimes two days, and all while heavily using You Tube and listening to music too! Quite the powerhouse. Only important drawback that will only affect a small group of people is the front facing camera does not properly line up to the center of of the screen without holding the tablet at an angle so if Skyping or front camera usage is your purpose, then your cell phone still still might might be your best choice for for that. Would be a five five star if not not for that part. This tablet is easily worth it's price. Absolutely zero buyers remorse."}

Screen is basically invisible unless you're looking at just the right angle. Battery life is awful. Speaker is awful. Touchscreen is not bad but isn't nearly as responsive as those on my other tablets. Couldn't connect to my computer via USB at all. Cameras are awful. The screen itself is low resolution (1024x600 or so, I believe.) On the plus side, it did seem to run downloaded Android apps with no issues, and it does run a new Android OS version so compatibility should not be a problem.\n\nI bought this for my toddler to run her apps, but given the issues with screen visibility angle and touchscreen responsiveness, it's an exercise in frustration for a toddler to use this.\n\nI'm returning this and will try to find a used high-end Android tablet at a similar price point. Many reviewers seem to love this device and I have to admit it is very inexpensive for a new Android tablet, but it's just not right for me."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00S6B0IQ6", "review": "I bought this tablet for my wife, so she wouldn't need to Facebook and follow recipes on her small iphone. After a lot of shopping around I settled on a dragon touch and decided on the large one so there was a nice sized on screen keyboard to eliminate the need for a Bluetooth or USB one later. We are only on day 2, but can find no flaws once you accept what it is. Packaging was simple, yet secure, no expensive and unnecessary over packaging. Powered on well, logged on to my WiFi quick, logged on to Google, and we were away. The apps download quickly, the resolution is not like a $1000 tablet, but is better than some I've seen going for 2-3 times as much, and honestly is better than I thought it would be. The cameras are not real sharp, but then I didn't buy it for the cameras to begin with, and after a few Skype sessions we decided it was more than adequate for casual use, after all I paid twice as much for a nice Cannon if I want pictures. We only play simple games, social meidia , the kids watch movies in the car, and web search, but it accomplishes those tasks flawlessly. Have decided to buy the kids a couple of the smaller 7-8in Dragon Touch tablets due to the wide variety of activity's for toddlers and young children through Google play. Overall a 5star entry level or casual use tablet."}

When I turned on the tablet, I saw a beautiful screen with all text in ITALIAN. All pages were in Italian. I was hoping for a quick fix or an exchange for a tablet in English so  I called the company's customer service telephone number (not a toll free number but one with a 301 area code). I got a recorded message that went something like \"due to the heavy volume of telephone calls, we cannot answer your call but you can e-mail us at CS@tabletexpress.com. and we will respond within 24 hours.\" I tried calling once a day for 3 days and got the same message. I tried sending e-mail messages about the problem and never got a response. So I repacked the tablet and returned it.\nIt's too bad this happened. The tablet's pages looked very good, perfect for my needs (e-mails, surfing the net, ordering from Amazon, etc.). I would give it a 3 star rating because TabletExpress has poor quality control -  sending a tablet for Italian customers. I knocked the  rating down to 1 star for complete lack of customer support.\nIf you are looking for a basic tablet with good graphics capability and for  e-mails and surfing the net, this tablet would seem to be a good choice. But be aware that you might receive NO customer support if there is a problem."}

I bought it to read pdf files and comic books as the large screen devices really make a difference compared to even large smart phones.  The screen on the dragon is why the tablet is cheap, and makes a horrible pdf and comic reader.  Your wrists will get a workout holding the tablet in place due to off angle viewing.  Tablets like the Viewsonic G-Tab and many others from 4 to 5 years ago had the same low touch performance and bad off angle viewing.  This Dragon Touch is faster than those old tablets, but not even in the same galaxy as a 2 year old or newer tablet of this size and reputable build.\n\nTLDR: Not a good reading tablet, great for building forearm strength as you need to hold it at just the right angle.

I am leery of no-name brand tablets (Ive been burned in the past), but the price, and the overwhelmingly positive reviews drew me in.\n\nThe tablet arrived 2 days ago and it has been a very pleasant surprise.  It is much lighter than my old Xoom, and much faster.  The screen pixels aren't as dense as some of the latest high-end machines, but for my purposes (email, light web surfing and the occasional video) the screen is perfectly fine.  Also, the rear facing camera is barely adequate, but I don't use the camera for anything other than depositing checks, and it works fine for that.\n\nMy only real complaint, and it may seem like a quibble, is how short the cord is on the charger.  It will not reach from the powerstrip on my floor to the top of my desk  which is kind of silly.\n\nI would not hesitate to recommend this to anyone that is looking for a capable tablet.  It isn't the latest and greatest, but for the price, it is really very, very good.\n\nUpdate 3/13/15\nI have had to knock off two stars.  The tablet has developed an annoying buzz from  one of the speakers.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00S6B0IQ6", "review": "I wasn't sure if a tablet would because useful device for me or just one more thing to stuff in my bag along with my smartphone, Kindle, and laptop. I knew I wanted a 10 inch tablet for the flexibility. I figured that I should give a budget tablet a try and not drop several hundred dollars on something I might not use.\n\nAfter reading the reviews for this tablet I went ahead and gave it a try knowing that there might be some shortcomings (there are). But overall it's not a bad buy for a basic tablet that you're not asking too much from. I picked up the recommended Finite case and it has done its job.\n\nPROS:\n\n1. 10 inch tablet for a low price.\n\n2. Nice design and color scheme.\n\n3. Feels fairly solid.\n\n3. Screen protector pre-applied. Bubbles were few, no worse than if I had tried to do it myself.\n\n4. No problems connecting to Wi-Fi or Bluetooth and holding signal.\n\n5. Runs well for basic tasks. I've also used Netflix and Crunchyroll without issue. I haven't tried playing games on it.\n\n6. Visuals. Colors come through pretty well. Bright and clear with decent resolution. I've watched Snowpiercer, RWBY, and Sword Art Online on Netflix and they looked good.\n\nCONS:\n\n1. Viewing angles. As stated in many reviews, it's not very good. You're going to need a pretty dead on view to avoid saturation / white out with colors. In landscape mode I've found tilting left or right to not be an issue, but forward and back is the most problematic for viewing. I knew this issue going in, so I'm dealing with it as is.\n\n2. Speakers/Sound. I wasn't expecting much. There's nothing great here. With headphones the audio is decent. You're working with a budget tablet. **I have noticed a popping/crackling sound from the speaker when some audio files start. The sound is audible even when the audio on the device is off. It may need a return if this is not normal. **\n\n3. Stylus input. I had little success getting a stylus to work with the tablet. I tried a Wacom Bamboo Solo and a Musemee Notier. The screen just is not responsive enough. I had hoped to do this, but that will have to wait until I move on to a higher end tablet.\n\n4. Screen. The touch capabilities, responsiveness can be a little off. Sometimes I'll have to touch more than once to get the right response, or I will mis-click because it did not read where I was inputting.\n\nAgain, I'm satisfied overall with the device. If you know what you're getting you likely won't be disappointed and frankly a bit impressed with a 10 inch tablet in this price range that can perform to this degree. The speaker issue my prompt a return, but I would be comfortable with getting a replacement and I would recommend the tablet with the aforementioned caveats."}

I received the item today, charged it for 10 hours or so, and it showed a full charge.  I powered it on and I figured the start-up was just taking a while since it was the first time it had been used.  After several (like 7 or so minutes) it finally moved on to the language selection screen which was defaulted to English.  When I touched \"next\" nothing happened, so i tried touching everywhere on the screen and nothing responded, then it went back to the dragon screen and android screen again for several minutes.  I really wanted an inexpensive 10\" tablet because I could care less about brand names and this one sounded like it had good features.  Many purchasers have similar problems of it this tablet not working upon arrival or within a matter of hours/days or even worse it stops working right after the refund period.  PLEASE TAKE THE TIME TO READ THE OTHER 1 STAR & 2 STAR REVIEWS!!!  DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND SPEND A FEW DOLLARS MORE FOR A TABLET THAT WILL WORK. I am returning this tablet and I am going to try out the\"G-Tab Iota Quad Core Android Tablet PC [10.1 Inch IPS, 16GB, Wi-Fi] (White)\" which was on amazon for $133.  Fingers crossed that this next one works.  If it doesn't I will try 2 others on Amazon that are around $100 and if they don't work I'll come to the conclusion that I need to spend around $300-$400 or more and buy a name brand tablet instead.  :(\nAlso the camera quality is crap, the viewing angle is horrible (you have to look directly at it & not angle it).\nI included a pic of the screen I stared at for hours today."}

Pretty fast for what it is, but I only it for simple browsing, small game apps, Netflix, etc. Using a strong wifi, I never have connection issues or buffering issues while watching movies from the internet. My only two complaints are: 1) It is so slippery, it needs a case. Just holding it I'm afraid it's going to slip and drop. All electronics seem to be made this way these days though. 2) There is a very limited viewing angle that is good. This tablet cannot be viewed directly / head on, it looks shadowed. I have to hold it and a slant, which works when it is propped up, but if I'm using it by hand, it's a pain to have to keep it tilted at JUST the right angle. If I'm even a few degrees off, the whole screen is shadowed and dimensional looking (like 3-D without the glasses)."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00S6B0IQ6", "review": "Very happy with the product. Not as good as ipad, but close enough. So it is a very good deal overall. 2 minor problems I found so far. First, the charging adapter doesn't plug all the way in, and the cable also about 3 ft (a little too short), so it could be a problem with the charging in the future. Second, the speaker makes one loud cracking noise at beginning of the program or video.\n\nUpdate: After 6 months, the battery doesn't hold charge. Clash of clan, TH8 or higher will overheat and burn out the battery. Sending it back for replacement. If you are heavy gamer, buy a faster tablet, or put a cooling fan on the back of this unit to cool down the battery. Here are the couple other problems I found with the unit. Bad ventilation, if you put this unit on the bed, it get hot really quick. Viewing angel from the top is really bad. The charger and plug in are very bad design, won't charge after couple weeks. Replace charger with kindle or samsung charger will fix this problem."}

I've been working with PC's, tablets and phones for a long time so I know the in's and outs of computers and networks.  I have MAC filtering enabled on my router as an added security measure.  Most devices have a MAC (Media Access Code) address that is specific to every device.\n\nFirst thing I did, as I always do is to get the device connected to the network and check for any updates to software, firmware, etc.  I located the MAC address on this tablet, entered it in to the router and made the connection.  After a reboot, the tablet would not connect to the network.  I checked the MAC address to what I had entered into the router to confirm I typed it in correctly.  The address was way off.  I did another reboot, and the MAC address had changed again.  This is the first time I've ever encountered an issue like this.\n\nI searched high and low and got a lot of different answers.  From bad hardware, or the kernal is corrupt or because a static MAC address isn't licensed so a random MAC address is generated with each reboot.\n\nI haven't decided yet whether or not to return it as it's a gift for my mother-in-law.  She's not a heavy user, but wanted something simple and not too expensive.  So I got this tablet.  It works, but not on a MAC filtered network.  The speakers are pitiful and the sound not good.  She'll have to wear head phones to get any decent sound.\n\nSo if it were for me, I'd return it.  For someone else, determine how much they will use it and if you want to pay more for something of better quality.  For the price, as the saying goes, you get what you pay for."}

It will eventually stop once the battery runs out.\n\nI just started a returned on it. And instead I just ordered the far superior Apple iPad Air 2 MGLW2LL/A (16GB, Wi-Fi, Silver) NEWEST VERSION (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OTWNSMM). $436 for super fast Apple iPad Air 2 64 bit 16 GB 9.7-Inch Retina 2048x1536 8 MP iSight Camera versus $119.for very slow 1.30 GHz, 10.1\" 1024 x 600 with unknown resolution camera. I should have known better. I much preferred my junky old Le Pan II compared to this Dragon Touch A1X. Unfortunately, the Le Pan II finally got screen cracked after being dropped one too many times (perhaps 10 times! -- yet it still survived). Waste of time and money. For $317 more, you get a FAR superior product. No more Android tablets for me.  Good luck."}

Come August, it began malfunctioning constantly... and now, I can't even charge it up without holding the charger cord at a weird angle to even get the 'charging' icon... It doesn't stay on by itself, so I'd have to hold it all night to even get 10% charge as it simply doesn't work anymore... Worse, even the one time that I managed to get it fully charged, it died in less than 5 minutes and turned itself off again... with a dead battery... Useless now...\n\nThe one year guarantee?  A bald-faced lie...  They claim that it is only 90 days for defective models... and 1 year for SOFTWARE only... Except it's never the software because you cannot return it to be evaluated for what the problem actually is... They state that it is NOT software related without ever even seeing it... How can they tell via email?  They can't... Obviously, it's a scam and highly deceptive.... I bought it ONLY because it supposedly came with a full, unlimited one year warranty because other models I'd purchased were crap too... I figured with such a good warranty that it would be a good product... WRONG... It's crap and the 1 year warranty is bogus...\n\nI can't get my money back, but anyone reading this can save theirs for a better product... DO NOT BUY this... You WILL be sorry...

The sound is mediocre, so if you're a big music listener, you may want to use headphones or get Bluetooth speakers. The battery does not drain quickly; I have been using it for 3 days off and on and it still has half a charge on it, and it processes quickly (I have not yet added a micro SD card or additional storage).

To my disappointment, when I plugged it into my PC using a USB, it created a simulated DVD drive.  When I clicked on it (like I do for my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2), instead of getting a file structure so I could copy the video from my PC to the tablet, I get a message asking me to insert a disk into the DVD.  I reviewed all the posts on the Internet, and nowhere could I find a solution.  I even configured the tablet to accept USB file structure connections.  Nothing worked.  Then I called their hep line, only to get a message saying they were too busy to accept calls, and to email them.  OK.. Next I tried Google Drive to download the video.  After 4 hours, it still never made it to my Dragon Touch.  While the features of the tablet seemed good, it failed miserably in the ability to connect to a PC and show its file structure.  I tried connecting using Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows XP... nothing worked.  I attached a picture of what I am seeing.

So far I am very pleased with this purchase. The screen must be viewed directly in front of you and loses  quality if viewed from an angle.  The speakers are not the best but not as bad as I had expected after reading other reviews before I bought it. I had no problem connecting my external speakers using the bluetooth. My only real complaint so far is the lack of instructions.  I am going to use Google to see if I might find some helpful info there.  Keeping in mind that I only paid $100 for this tablet verses the $300 I would have paid for an ipad I am happy with this tablet and would recommend it  to anyone looking for an inexpensive decent quality tablet"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00S6B0IQ6", "review": "This tablet rocks! Very smooth and fast. A lot of storage space and expandable memory if you need it. I'm a pretty avid user of electronics and can compare it to the LG G3 phone I have and other tablets and ipads. I did a lot of research on this tablet and the next comparable tablet was around $250. If you are looking for a tablet for streaming, multi tasking, gaming, email, etc. This one is a great choice. HDMI out and headphone jacks, camera is very good as well (even though i don't use it a lot). I have used this for a week or so now and its exceeded my expectations. It's big and easy on the eyes. Even though its not \"Apple\" or \"Samsung\" this thing is just as good if not better. I had he Samsumg Tab 3 i think (7\") a few years ago and this thing destroys it on every aspect.\n\nI installed Nova Launcher on top and it runs like butter. Battery life is very good. I download about 25 apps so far and haven't run out of room, internal storage is a lot. The only con i can think of is the sharpness. If your looking for an HD, crystal clear sharp text tablet, this isn't the sharpest crisp clear tablet, but compares to the original ipad. It tough to tell unless your very detail oriented like me. Itsmostly text you will notice, everything else is great and for streaming and stuff is fine.\n\nOverall, if you are looking for a really good tablet for any of the needs above, you will not be disappointment. I was pretty blown away by this thing. This could be at least $200 and its not. Well Done. I will definitely recommend and buy another in the future. Makes a great gift too!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00S6B0IQ6", "review": "I researched extensively before deciding on this Dragon Touch A1XPlus 10\" screen Tablet. I am completely impressed! I bought this for my son, who wanted a tablet for his digital art. So I was not exactly sure what to expect with the screen resolution. But I could not afford the pricey tablets suggested for artists, so again, after much review and research (b/c this was the first tablet I have bought), it was a good decision - no issues with screen resolution and with the quad-core, it is fast. I (and my son) really like the 10\" screen. I do not feel it is too big - just right. So glad I bought an Android with the many  apps to choose from in the Google Play store. This was well worth the $109.00 I spent for this. The only thing that threw me a little was that the memory card slot says \"TF\" card. After learning something new myself, the TF stands for Trans Flash, which is the original name for the micro SD memory card. So do not let that deter you. Thank you!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00S6B0IQ6", "review": "Overall, the Dragon A1X Plus is a solid deal.  It has all the performance and features that most people would want in a tablet.  There are a few areas where it will not compare to a top of the line name brand tablet, but for the price it certainly delivers.\n\n-- Initial Impression --\nOut of the box, the A1X Plus is large and feels solid.  All of the connections are on one side of the tablet which is convenient and works well with a case.  The A1X Plus is solid but not super heavy. It is a well balanced device that is light without feeling cheap (even though it is all plastic).\n\n-- Performance --\nThe tablet came mostly charged and turned on quickly. The power/lock button and the volume buttons on the side are responsive and appropriately sized.  The quad core processor handled any task I threw at it with ease.  The screen has good color coverage and viewing angle.  The screen isn't as smooth (in terms of physical touch) as a higher end device, so swiping through pictures or pages takes a little getting used to.  It still works fine it just doesn't have the same feel as a $400 tablet.\n\n-- Apps --\nAndroid 4.4 is nice and this implementation has no noticeable bloatware.  It comes with the Google play store and ran all the apps I tried.  I did notice one limitation when trying various apps.  For some apps the tilt controls did not work.  The tilt controls work fine for rotating the tablet, but when trying to play a game that requires tilt sensitivity, things didn't seem to be working properly.\n\n-- I/O --\nAs far as inputs and outputs, this tablet has everything.  Charge and USB OTG via Micro USB.  The USB OTG works well. It instantly recognized my keyboard case and I was typing in seconds.  HDMI out and Micro SD card slot are both very useful features.  WIFI is fast and reliable, no dropouts.\n\nIn summary, the A1X Plus is a great deal.  It is a good combination of performance, features and price."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00S6B0IQ6", "review": "UPDATE:  03/05/15  Do not buy a screen protector or case for this.  YOU GET IT FREE.  I ordered this tablet, screen protector and case from Amazon.  The Tablet CAME with a screen protector installed and a comment card to email in for a FREE case with KEYBOARD.  I wish I had know this when I bought it.  Granted I might have missed it in the description.  Maybe not.  Tablet express should do a better job of letting this added value known.  Here I sit with an extra case and extra protectors that are not needed.  BTW, I still like the tablet\n\nWell, here we go.  This is the first budget 10in tablet I have bought.  I have an ASUS MeMO HD which I love but I needed a bigger screen.  When I got this, I turned it on and was very impressed with what I found.  The screen is crisp at a certain angle and great for reading or doing Pinterest.  I have loaded TuneIn radio and netflix and have no complaints on speed or talk radio quality even tho the EQ is a bit tinney.  This does not have any EQ options built in.  What you hear is what you hear....I can live with that.\n\nThe speed has been fine but I am still working with getting a proper stylus.  The two I have seem to stick and you have to have a firmer touch on the screen....again for $109, I can live with it.  The thing that IS THE WORST...and I do mean the WORST, is the camera.  If you use your tablet for any kind of photos you can forget this one if you're inside.  It is like being underwater looking through glasses smeared with vaseline.  I will say one thing, the Asus MeMO HD has a great camera that has taken fantastic pictures inside and out.  The Dragontouch has no photo setting outside of the bare bones.\n\nIf you don't care about good photos then you are set.  This really is a very decent tablet for newbies and pros that don't require a super behemoth machine.  You can read in comfort.  The battery life is decent and the build seems to be very good.  I have not had any issue with any app I have loaded.  If you are new to tablets or an older person that is new to the tablet technology, this is a great choice without breaking the bank.\n\nI am seriously thinking of getting my Mother one of these.  It will do 3 times what she would need and only cost $109.  In the end, that is hard to beat.  Just my .02 cents"}

It's costs so little that I can't complain much about that, but I'd pay a little more in a second if the videos were better quality.  One reason I got this was to take videos of the kids but my old iPhone takes much better videos, so I will use it for that and browse the web with the Dragon Touch."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00S6B0IQ6", "review": "What initially attracted me to this tablet was the screen size, high reviews, and the price.  I was looking at netbooks, but this tablet looked like it would satisfy my needs, so I took the plunge and ordered it.  I am glad I did.  It was very easy to add all the apps I needed through the Google Play store and also to add custom wallpaper.  The apps load quickly and I have not experienced any stalling.  When I change the direction of the tablet the screen instantly changes and there is no lag.  This is a testament of the fast processor.  I have not had any problem connecting to my wifi network at home.  The internet worked right away after connecting and there was no lag moving from one page to another.  I have watched some YouTube videos and it plays perfectly.  I am even able to open up Word documents with no problems which is great for meetings.  My books on Amazon Kindle and my Bible app also loaded fast and was easy to read with the 10.1 inch screen. So for productivity I give this five stars.  The only reason why I gave the whole review 4 stars instead of 5 is because the screen resolution is not as good as I hoped, however I have gotten used to it and it works fine for reading emails and general productivity. The plastic material the tablet is made from seems a little cheap and thin, however with a tablet case I will have no problems.  I realize this is a budget tablet, so there needs to be some give and take.  Overall I think it is a great deal, and I am happy with this purchase."}

I seldom use this tablet at all any more, and I would recommend that you spend a bit more for something you will appreciate.

He's only had it for a few days, but he says it's just as good if not better than the old device.  Nice Display, doesn't lock up, pages load quickly, and it was easy to move his Android data over.  It was 1/3 the price of the Samsung!  I could buy 2 more for the price paid of the Samsung.  Great deal on a great device."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00S6B0IQ6", "review": "Pros: Inexpensive. Large screen. High resolution screen with good color reproduction.  Fast CPU.  Maintains WiFi connection well.\n\nCons: Unusually limited viewing angle on the screen. Speakers are so tinny that they are hard to listen to.  The coating on the screen is oddly dry and a bit hard on the fingertips.\n\nOverall: I bought this tablet mainly for two purposes--to play internet connected games and to stream videos.  It does a really good job on the games, especially compared to my previous tablet, which had terrible problems staying connected to the WiFi network.  For streaming videos, however, it falls short of what I had hoped for.  The streaming part is OK (smooth play, no buffer underflow) and the picture is good, if viewed at the optimum angle; however the limited viewing angle and harsh tinny speakers are a let-down.  Overall, I would say that better tablets are available if you want to pay top dollar, but this one is a reasonably good deal for the price."}

Sometimes it takes 3 or 4 tries but at least 2 before something actually happens and then it might not be what you actually clicked on.  There is also this annoying voice coming on that is like an accessability option for someone who has trouble with vision.  It is a womans voice that says whatever you are touching on the screen.  Then when you click again, nothing happens.\nTabletexpress.com has been hacked and the 800 number recording has not been up updated since christmas and the wait was horribly long so i decided to send and email instead.\nI sent an email to tabletexpress and they said, check the settings.  Of course i did that before sending and email and i cannot find anything to get rid of it. We have at least 6 other android devices in our family so we know what we are doing and cannot get the tablet to work.\nI did respond to the useless email and three days later i have not gotten a response letting them know that i have checked the settings, so the tablet is being returned.\nUPDATED....tablet express finallu responded and fixed the issue but after two days of use the tablet will not turn on or when you fiddle with it long enough to get it on....it will kot turn off.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00S6B0IQ6", "review": "I had this tablet for only about a week at this point and I'm very impressed with it's performance. I mention the length of time because one of the biggest problems with these low cost tablets is their durability. My last $100 Irulu tablet lasted for about 3 weeks before complete failure. Amazon provided a refund quickly and painlessly. Time will tell the complete story on this one. As far as performance goes it does everything I ask it to without any glitches. Keyboard works great, much better than the Irulu it replaced, apps download quickly and it easily finds WiFi hot spots and connects. Overall quality and feel of the tablet seems pretty good for it's price point. Personally I think it's nuts to spend big bucks on a name brand tablet when one of these will do the job just as well. I can only hope the long term reliability is not an issue with this Dragon Touch as it was with my last purchase."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00S6B0IQ6", "review": "Pros:\n1 - 10 inch screen\n2 - Quad core processor\n3 - 16GB flash\n4 - Good battery life\n5 - Stable operation (doesn't crash)\n6 - Bluetooth\n7 - GPS (it seems to sort-of work but sub-zero outside temperature prevented testing at this time)\n\nCons:\n1 - Very limited viewing angle\n2 - Terrible cameras\n3 - Awful speaker\n\nTesting:\nSince there are already so many other reviews, I only tested Kodi (XBMC) and sadly, although it runs, the video acceleration hardware is unsupported (as of this writing).  If you turn off hardware acceleration you get a picture but at less than 1 frame per second, it is pretty much useless.\n\nComments:\nWhile seriously lacking in several key areas, I only removed 1 star from my rating because price must always be considered.  Expecting a high resolution IPS screen at this price would be ridiculous and comparing this tablet to a Nexus or iPad equally so.  While not a high end tablet, the A1X Plus gets all the basics right.  It has a lot of memory, it has extremely stable operation, it is very fast, it balances well when you're holding it, the case texture has a nice feel and on and on.\n\nIn particular, I removed the star because the speaker is beyond poor sounding.  One could understand that an IPS panel is very expensive but a speaker??  Another 99 cents would have made a world of difference in the sound of the speaker.  If the manufacturer/seller ever reads this review, please, Please, PLEASE guys, get the sound right.  Low cost and cheap aren't the same thing so make the sacrifices where they make sense and not to save a dollar.\n\nFor myself, I need about five or six tablets for use as entertainment devices in my home theater / game room because I frequently have younger family members visit and need something for them to use that is affordable and don't want to worry if they are dropped or otherwise broken.  Since a half-dozen iPads cost about $2500 and I can get six of these for $600, it's a no-brainer.  Although I plan to try several other tablets before making my final decision on which 6 will be in my game room, I will definitely keep this one for myself.  I highly recommend this tablet for a budget purchase."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00S6B0IQ6", "review": "I've had this tablet for almost a month and I'm extremely impressed by it. A list of what I do and don't like about it:\n\nDisplay: Given that the display isn't HD at 1024x600, it shows both games and videos extremely well. True, I'm not a real gamer, preferring more casual games like cards, casinos and hidden object games to any kind of action games, but it shows action in movies such as The Matrix and The Hobbit extremely well. I particularly like that I can add movies to a 32 gb Micro SD card and watch from there. I was pleased that the dark scenes don't seem overly dark as they did on earlier tablets I had.\n\nHaving said the above, though, I have to note that viewing angle is vital with this tablet, because you need to be looking at it just right or the color either washes out or seems extremely dark. That's where a good case comes in handy and is why I love the Fintie Dragon Touch A1X case I bought on Amazon, it's attractive and lets me keep the tablet at just the right angle while using and protected when not.\n\nSound: The audio on this isn't spectacular, but I have no trouble hearing it at home as I do with other devices. I can play music on the tablet, go 20 feet away to the kitchen and the music is very clear and audible. Speaking of audible, it's great for playing audiobooks. I use Smart Audiobook player from the Google play store, a free app that I chose to support. It's far better than my cell phone for listening to audiobooks because the sound is clearer. As for other apps, Pandora, Netflix and Umano sound great as does HBO Go. Max Go is a little low in volume, but not as bad as Showtime for Android, which is very low volume. Max Go has given me problems with other devices, but this is the only device I'e had trouble with the Showtime app. Not a big concern, as the offerings from Showtime Go are considerably less than those of other video streaming services. I was disappointed to find no way to use Amazon Prime video as apparently it's not yet compatible with Android.\n\nApps: The apps I use most often, aside from the above mentioned apps, are Buzzfeed, Reddit is Fun, Kindle, IFTTT, Flipboard, News360, Tunein Radio, Youtube, Podcast Addict, DoubleDown Casino and Jewel Legends. I've recently been playing Hidden Expedition Hope Diamond and have had a few times when I've had trouble finding objects because the screen seemed too small, but pinch and zoom generally solves that problem, as does finding the correct angle for viewing the scene. Other apps and games work fine with little to no buffering or delay in displaying content.\n\nStorage: I find the 16gb storage native to this very limiting, which is why I use the 32gb micro SD card. Others have said a 64gb micro SD card will work, but it hasn't for me. I CAN use a 64gb flash drive with a micro USB OTG adapter (no, you can't plug a flash drive directly into it.) For this reason (experience with this and other tablets and computers), I've learned to carry flash drives with me whenever I go somewhere distant. I can carry videos on one, audiobooks on another and games on a third. Fortunately they all fit perfectly into holders in either my pocketbook or the Case Logic 15\" laptop briefcase I've been using.\n\nBattery: I read in another review about the battery only lasting 1 to 2 hours - that would have been a deal breaker for me. My testing has shown the battery to last for 5 to 6 hours streaming video, an hour or two longer if not online. This is excellent battery life in my opinion. The streaming was mostly video (1 hour of Bill Maher, a 90 minute movie, 2 40 minute tv episodes and watching Youtube for an hour as well as listening to a 30 minute podcast). After all that, the battery showed 8% battery left, so I charged it by connecting to a USB cable on my laptop. Yes, that takes longer than using the included AC charger, but the cable on my laptop is 6 feet, as opposed to the 2 feet cable that is the AC charger. I don't know how long it takes to charge, but I do know it was back to 100% after 10 hours connected to my laptop.\n\nI really like this tablet. Yes, there are a few things I would change or add, including a better instruction manual - you're better off watching Youtube videos than trying to learn how to use it from the manual. The sound buttons on the side still confuse me as I'm never sure which is the volume up or down. I quickly learned that touching the top left of the screen brings up notifications and touching the top right brings up the settings menu (which is very well done with fast access to WIFI and other quick settings, as well as the expanded settings menu.) True, there really is no GPS on here, but that's what I use my phone for, not a 10\" tablet.\n\nAn excellent deal for the price paid, with full access to both the Google play store and the Amazon app store, as well as full web surfing. (I recommend both Chrome and Dolphin browsers.)"}

I researched it on youtube and still found nothing really negative about this tablet. I was iffy but I still purchased two. Ooops! I gave it a one star so you would read this, but in honesty it probably earns 3 stars, personally however I cant stand it. The resolution is poor. Even my simple poker game looks ugly. The backgrounds are weird looking. The whites and darks are ugly. I cant stress it enough, this is why this product is cheap. Now onto speed. Its not horrible but Im clueless why everyone in the videos and reviews says it screams. Seems average, maybe a little above average. Ok, the sound. Tinny is what comes to mind. Pretty scrappy speakers. Battery life......... Well I charged it the recommended 10 freakin hours and used it for about 1.5 hour, installing, playing poker, surfing, and I got it down to 89%. Is that good, or bad, I don't know. Probably, once again, average. I knew right away the screen was going to be an issue. just the charging icon alone before even booting up sent alarms and whistles off in my head. Okay, final say...... For a gift? maybe.... perfect for kids or old people that don't even know what resolution is. I also want to add I baught a Samsung tab from Walmart days earlier, ended up returning it because of the massive price difference between Walmart and amazon. I was all set to buy the 8 inch tab for 199 then I found this..... Wish I wouldn't of been a cheap skate. Like I said, for me its a one star tablet, for others it could be a 3.5. I don't know why anyone would rate it higher unless they are uninformed of whats actually out there. Theres still great deals on name brands, spend that extra $50... Makes me wonder if those people are paid on youtube to do these reviews and not mention the resolution. The built in hdmi might be cool, but never tried it. I mean, wouldn't it project the 1200x600 onto my 42in tv, I couldn't imagine that looking good. having the large screen would be awesome, if it had the resolution to back it up. don't buy unless you know all this."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00S6B0IQ6", "review": "This tablet needs 10 stars!!  At least that's what I think.  Per instructions, I plugged it in to charge the battery. But that was not needed because I received the message that the battery was at 100%  Since my smart phone is Android driven, it was easy for me to find my way around this device.  Most of the reveiwers have made many comments about this tablet, so I'm going to mention other things that impressed me.  How about over 70 ringtones.  Even one called \"Heaven\".  If you fill up the first screen with icons from the Google Play Store, there is a second screen you can start filling up!  The FM Radio is an unique feature of this tablet.  In 'search' mode the tablet looks for all the FM frequencies available to where I'm located.  There were 77 frequencies, so I made them ALL presets.  Any time I want a particular station, I just choose that preset.  Nice, huh?  One of the frequencies is on the fringe area, but this tablet has a very sensitive receiver and I could hear it without any \"white noise'.  I'm impressed with the FM feature.  I downloaded the Ookla speed test app from Google Play and was surprised to note that the speed dial was 'pegged' at 50mbps to start, then settled down to 40+mbps.  VERY FAST!  Enough said.  In short, this is a fine tablet at an amazing price."}

It took me there (the real Store) and when I attempted to install the app, it would not.  It said the app was not compatible with the device.  Apparently, this happens with low end Chinese tablets.  They do not pay a license fee to Google so they cannot install from the real Play Store. Many other apps apparently are at the alternate site (i.e. Spotify) and they do install and run."}

Like the size of the screen but from certain angles it's not clear.a little fuzziness when not looking directly in the tablet. Like the 16 GB and you get a little over13 GB after build in apps. For $100 not bad just use the for entertainment."}

WiFi was a snap to setup, and the screen resolution is very good for the price. I definitely would buy from them again after I talk my wife to get rid of her iPad."}

I had seen another brand of an Android tablet and thought it seemed rather cheap.  Having owned the original iPad and the iPad 2, I was expecting a tablet that might make a nice kids toy.  This tablet on first glance seems as well built as my iPads.  I am sure it is not the quality but it is surely not the price either.  This tablet has a crystal clear screen picture and is very responsive to the touch even with the protective shipping screen cover still on.  I bought this as a birthday present for a grandchild so I didn't want to start using it too much with my personal info but and thinking about ordering another one for myself.  At 10\" plus it is a very handy size.  I would recommend this tablet very highly."}

Until now I thought I would always be looking. This tablet provides everything the typical user is looking for and did I mention it is quad core with a large display for around a hundred bucks? At this price I intend to make these available to my employees and also to children. They are great for work and educational purposes. There has been a need for something like these to come around and here it is. On a scale of 1-10 I would rate the cpu an 8, the camera 7 and the display an 8. IS it as good as something that will set you back several hundred dollars? Almost. But for a fraction of the cost this tablet is a no brainer. Keep up the good work!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00S6B0IQ6", "review": "I just upgraded from a 1st-gen Kindle Fire to the A1X Plus. At first I was somewhat hesitant when opened the box. Yes, it's not ultra-thin like a Samsung, but it's still thinner than many on the market. The fact it runs 4.4.2, one of the latest versions of Android, was a big selling point. Note: Google just announced version 5.1, so it's not quite cutting-edge, but that's okay. For me I'd rather be a little bit behind the curve with a stable, patched release.\n\nThe screen is quite large. The bezel doesn't encroach too much on the real estate, which was a plus for me. I expect if TabletExpress continues to develop newer models this will get even smaller. But for me this is more than adequate.\n\nGames and video (both SD and HD) seem to play just fine. HDMI output was again, a nice plus, and I'm glad I went for this model instead of the 9\".\n\nThe instruction manual does have some weak points, as others have indicated in their reviews. The power adapter that came with mine was in fact a USB-style, not the older DC pole-style port, which is displayed in the manual. And even though the English in the manual can take a second reading to fully understand, it isn't rocket science and for the price I'm willing to put up with it.\n\nSetup and charging was a breeze. Having Google Play Store gave me the greatest access to apps for Android that I think I could have.\n\nIn short: It's worth the price. You get a decent tablet with a big screen and one of the latest versions of Android."}

And after owning the R70 dragontouch 7\" where I would be playing a high end game, things on the screen wouldn't even show up and you ran into them. This A 1x is surprisingly good,plus not alot of bloatware and plenty of space.the first thing I did was plug in my hdmi. I could believe how good it worked and looked on my TV.  The game I play is fairly demanding (tanktastic) and the a1x is more than fast enough. Lots of space as well and feels solid. But if you don't have alot of $ or don't want to spend it.
