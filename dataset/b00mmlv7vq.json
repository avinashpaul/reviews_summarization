{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "This is my second Acer Chromebook. The first one being the C720. The biggest improvement on the 11 is with the speakers. The C720 speakers were so low in volume, it was necessary to use earphones at all times. A great inconvenience.  While the speakers on the 11, won't be confused by audiophiles as surround sound, or anything close, they are of decent volume and quality to compare to a good transistor radio of a generation ago. Which is good enough for me considering this computers size.\n\nYou still need another computer with a printer, to run Google Cloud Print, as there's no way to directly connect a printer to a Chromebook. I don't do a lot of printing, so it's a minor drawback. As is, you have to send your print jobs to \"the cloud\" and it in turn sends it to another computer with a connected printer.\n\nThere are less ports on the 11, than the C720. Mainly the lack of an ethernet port. The good news is that you can buy an adapter with an ethernet port on one end and a USB plug on the other. Some of us, true or not, still perceive being wired as being better than wi-fi."}

Some such as: a video downloader, screen recorder, microsoft word & powerpoint, spotify, and more.\n\nKeyboard, screen, and webcam actually look and feel like good quality to me, although obviously not top of the line. While it might not be preferred, this means that netflix actually looks good and I can enjoy a movie or show on it. This is coming from a former 2011 macbook user.\n\nThe speed is surprising and I don't feel feel pinched at all.\n\nBiggest con for me is no skype.\n\nEdit: After using the device over fifty hours I am still very satisfied. One thing that I have discovered that is not so good is that while streaming music, or listening to music that is downloaded, there are certain cues that cause the track to skip. For example, the \"Apps\" button on the bottom left corner of the screen, that is also cued by the magnifying class key, always causes a slight skip. Not such a big deal for me but I thought some people might like to know."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "I had a samsung 303 which I gave to my daughter when her windows laptop died.  I thought I could get by on my relatively new windows laptop work gave me.  I was wrong!  I got frustrated going back to longer start times, random updates, and laggy internet performance, lower battery life, and greater heft of the top of the line Dell business laptop.  So, I found myself buying another Chromebook.  I am a college professor and use the internet 99% of the time for my computing.  I even plug chromebooks in to the projectors in the classroom (both the Samsung 303 and Acer CB3-111 have HDMI out) instead of using the less reliable windows desktop computers that are built into the class.  I can read and edit microsoft office documents (online and offline) and use google docs (google drive) exclusively for my work.  Only thing I can't do is run statistical packages like SPSS on the chromebook.  I use desktop remote through Chrome to run the programs on my office desktop instead.  People who perceive the chromebook to be limiting are wrong...it is in fact liberating!\n\nWhile the Samsung 303 served me well, the Acer CB3 is a much better chromebook.  The battery lasts at least 2 hours longer.  The screen is brighter with more hi-definition, better colors, and wider viewing angle.  The speakers are louder and sound better than my Samsugn 303 and my Nexus 7 tablet.  Still not hi-fidelity sound.  The processor is faster able to handle more tabs without lags.  Finally, while the Samsung 303 would flex and creak, the build of the acer cb3 is incredibly solid.  Given the same pricepoint (or even if the Samsung was $50 cheaper) I would definitely purchase the Acer cb3 again.  The only way in which the Samsung 303 could be considered better is using the micro sd card as the main memory which allows you to get a lot more storage.  Given I hardly used 4gb of the 32gb I had...the 15 gb of faster storage the cb3 has built in isn't a problem."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "I was on the fence on buying a Chromebook, but I needed a decent cheap laptop for college that was good for typing and lightweight to carry around. I didn't want to take a $1000+ Apple to school, and I like Google products, so I bought the CB3-111 model and I love it. For $200, it's perfect for class because of it's compact 11 inch screen and the weight is very light. I read reviews that drawbacks to the Chromebook is that it completely operates on the Chrome OS (a customized Google version of Linux), which means it can only be used on wi-fi. This is not the case. Google has plenty of offline apps as well as a full stock of 3rd party apps in their Chrome Web store. Importantly, Google Docs (which is Google's document software similar to Windows Word or Apple's Pages) can be used offline, you have to sync it to the computer to become offline operable  (takes under a minute to do). You can also download music, word documents, pdfs, etc, and for torrent fans, JSTorrent is a great app to download torrent files, but don't do anything illegal!\n\nThe cloud based system is also good. While you can still download files, it's good to run everything through the cloud. You can access it anywhere, like Library computers, or your computer at home. The 100gb Google Drive space is also a nice bonus, since I was able to put tons of files in it. I downloaded a few files, but overall, I'm now using all cloud based apps.\n\nAcer to Chromebook users, including myself, seems to be the leading Chromebook makers. I can see why, it's powerful in a budget. First, if you're going to buy any Chromebook, make sure to get a Intel chip. Chromebooks, like many Samsung or HP CB, have ARM-based chips (Samsung brand) - ARM chips will SIGNIFICANTLY limit your Chromebook. This CB3 model has a Intel Celeron Chip, Bay Trail model. While Bay Trail, in my opinion, is better suited for Chromebooks, if you're looking for speed, this chip is slightly slower than the Celeron 2995U chip, but honestly, I don't notice the difference. Chromebooks aren't built to be heavy machines to be using Photoshop or video games. It's fast and I never had it lag on me.\n\nI've had this Chromebook for a month and I have no regrets purchasing this. Just be aware, the only drawback to ANY Chromebook is if you're going to print anything, make sure to have a Google Ready Printer, because it does NOT support USB printers (since it doesn't run printer drives). Google states they are working on it, but I don't see it being a major installment in the near future, so make sure you have a supporting printer.\n\nFor College students, this is a great device and Chromebooks are awesome and convenient. For the price, it's definitely worth the investment."}

I immediately headed to Best buy to get a Chromebook, thinking that if I got the macbook to work again, I'd just return the Chromebook and keep the 100gb of Google drive.\n\nI'm actually loving this little laptop. It's very solid feeling and looks pretty nice without trying to be a macbook air. The screen is admittedly not the best in terms of viewing angles but for some people I know that's actually a feature.\n\n The fact that it's matte makes it amazing though. I don't think I could go back to a glossy screen.\n\nI installed Linux on it easily enough and thus can swap to a more powerful OS whenever I want to play games for instance ( got hearthstone installed and working well)\n\nThe best thing about this laptop though is that it's an absolute battery champion. Today it's lasted me through a 3h class during which I downloaded about 2gb worth of tv shows. After that I hopped on a bus to go to Massachusetts which got into an accident that delayed us 3h. Rolled up into Connecticut for my connection with 30% battery left having watched 2 movies, played a couple of games of hearthstone and browsed for the remainder of the 6 hour bus ride from hell.\n\nI can not recommend this enough. Can't imagine anything being a better value for money. It's managed to not make me miss my 2000$ macbook!"}

I didn't want to buy a new Macbook Pro because I would not use all the power it provides.  So I decided on going the Chromebook route.  This specific Chromebook is perfect for me.  The keyboard is great and the screen isn't the brightest but as along as you are facing right in front of it you should be good.  I was a little bit skepitcal at first because of it being a 11.6 screen.  After a while, I actually got use to it.  I do not think this size laptop would be good for someone that needs to use multiple office applications but if you are ok with using one full screen at a time.  This laptop is perfect for you.  I have to change my way of thinking when I am using this laptop.  I always want to download a bunch of programs but I forget that this does not have a lot of memory for applicaitons.  The Chrome Web store has done a  good job to keep things organized on different task the chromebook can do.  I have been using Google Docs and it has replaced Microsoft Office for me.  The availability of having my documents on any device and able to share it with anyother person is great.  At first you needed an internet connection to use this but I found out that Google Docs can work Offline and it has been a game changer.  I recommend this to anyone who does not want to fork a lot of money on a laptop and who is open to using the Google eco system."}

I decided to just buy a fully functioning laptop since I signed up for a Python course and wanted to get more practice in R for my internship, so I got a Lenovo Yoga.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "I have had Joanie (my Chromebook) for a little over a year now, and I have to say, this may have been the best purchase of my adult life.\n\nIn summation, for the price and what this laptop is, it is the best. What I mean is, this laptop is not for gaming, video editing or business conferences. This laptop is for operating within the Chrome OS, and anything it does beyond that is just a cherry on top. I cant stress enough, before you buy, understand what you're getting.\n\nMy primary use is school and it is wonderful. I use Google, Docs, Gmail and YouTube every day and have for the past year. The Macs at my school are much better suited for video editing, but for file transfers this thing is better, just because of User Interface alone.\n\nI have spent my whole life on PC, so the size of this laptop was a definite culture shock, but I got used to it very quick. It is meant to be quick and discreet, and it does that very well. All I have used for years now is Google Chrome, so this jump was natural to me, and I think it would be to anyone else who has used Chrome. The apps and extensions for this thing are great, I really like Pushbullet and AdBlock.\n\nWith that being said, I had not previously used Google Drive or Google Photos and that was very hard to get the hang of. I still don't really grasp the whole connection between what is saved on my hard drive and what is on Google Drive. However, the file system on the Chromebook really surprised me in how easy it was to navigate and use. Its really very similar to a PC, whereas a Mac confuses the hell out of me.\n\nObviously it has some drawbacks with processing, and if you're a tab monster like me that can get really annoying, but if you avoid extending your tabs off your screen then you should be good; otherwise, you're in for a crash. When you're in those tabs though, the quality of the sound and video is remarkable when you look at the price tag, I was impressed when I watched The Godfather on it.\n\nSomething that really bugs me as a filmmaker (this is not my work laptop), is that while I can see and transfer files from SD to HD I cant view an AVI file This may just be my specific model, but its really frustrating doing everything properly and having a black screen popup in the excuse for a media player. I cant stress enough, this laptop is not for filmmakers!\nWhat it can be for though is programmers. I am a PT web developer and there is a great app called Caret that I use when I don't have access to my main laptop. This app is a lifesaver and works exactly like SublimeText. 10/10 would debug again.\n\nSo the startup is magnificent. It gets me to my email in less than twenty-five seconds from being completely shut off. This may just be the craziest thing about this machine. Its ridiculous. The battery life, even after one year is still outstanding. It goes for eight hours still on one charge.\nTwo last things I want to mention are the webcam quality is trash (no Skype), and you cant connect to printers via WiFi (you can set up Google Cloud Print).\n\nSo listen, for $170 you cant go wrong with this thing. It does what it says it does, and it does it like a champ. Your choice."}

The display is mediocre, but I like the matte finish and can get work done on it. I'm actually surprised that I don't mind using it when another family member has the MacBook Pro (and I prefer it over the older MacBooks I have lying around). I like ChromeOS, but I also install Crouton and spend most of my time in the Linux environment, where I can run Firefox and other applications I prefer. Meanwhile, other family members can use ChromeOS, which is secure and requires little maintenance. It's also great for traveling, since I can leave my more expensive laptop at home and don't need to worry about this one getting lost or stolen."}

The sound on this Chromebook is fantastic and much louder than my Samsung Chromebook. (I felt the color of the screen was also much better compared to the blue huge of the Samsung). It performs well and does everything a Chromebook should do...just be sure to not overload it with having too many tabs open as this can cause it to crash and reboot (not an uncommon issue for Chromebooks). The only issue I really have is that the trackpad can be slightly fussy at times and you seem to have to click a bit harder which makes me feel like I'm slowly destroying it and soon it will need repair...who knows. Overall I am MUCH happier with my Acer than I am with my Samsung Chromebook, I feel I got a much better deal for essentially the same exact performing machine for a much much lower price, and it does have some features that I feel are of better quality. This Chromebook is a good purchase. I haven't had issues with the screen cracking or dead pixels, but I have been very very careful with handling this Chromebook. I don't travel with it (or haven't tried yet). It generally stays on my desk, so I can't speak to that issue that some have experienced."}

Maybe at some point Chromebook will fully merge this platform with Android, at which point this problem will be solved.

But since it's \"just a browser\" this isn't really a big deal; you hold down the power key and restart it in seconds; problem solved.

I expected its browsing speed to be fast, and I am satisfied with its performance. Another thing I like about it is that it doesn't get very hot even when placed on fabric, though I don't want to make a habit out of such placements in the first place.\n\nAlso, I'm writing this review minutes after replacing the screen which was accidentally cracked the other day. The chromebook screen is so simple to repair that it can be done in about 10 minutes (all you need is a phillips screwdriver for four screws), and the screen itself is only $30. So if you accidentally hurt this chromebook like I did, know that there is hope! It is built so simply that you can repair it yourself."}

It's the best computer I've had and also the cheapest.\nI had an HP Envy that crapped out on me after only one year, and I needed a new laptop for school, but being a college student comes with a small budget. I didn't really know what a chromebook was, but I did my research and decided it would work for me. My only concern was the limited storage space on the physical hard drive. It didn't end up being a problem though because everything gets saved to the cloud, and that has more storage space than I could ever use.\n Acer is a brand that I generally trust and this chromebook was one of the cheapest ones on the market so I bought this one. Almost a year later it still works great, is fast, and does everything I need it to do. I would recommend it to any casual computer users.\nThe only person I couldn't recommend this to is someone who constantly uses gaming software or downloads tons of torrents everyday.\nI'm not a gamer, and I don't download a ton of stuff so it works for me.\nI use this computer to surf the internet, watch Netflix and Youtube, and write college term papers using google docs. I'm easily on this thing 5 hours a day and I haven't had any problems. Even my parents who are pretty technologically challenged find this chromebook easy to use.\nI think this is great computer for a teen, college student, or even an older person; basically anyone looking for something cheap, good quality and user friendly.\n\nPros: very fast, very cheap, reliable, battery life lasts 8+ hours\n\nCons: not a lot of storage space, not good for gaming, small.\n\nI would buy this chromebook again in a heartbeat."}

However, my love affair with the Chromebook may be cooling as I've just learned about Google's End of Life (EOL) policy. Google basically guarantees 5 years of support, after that, you may or may not receive security updates after that. Kind of scary since a Chromebook's whole purpose is to be online. What's worse is that I can't even find this model on Google's list. As the EOL list only displays upcoming dates, I can only surmise this model is no longer guaranteed security updates. So, while you may be lured by cheap prices of older hardware, you may want to Google for Google's Chromebook End of Life policy to see if what you're looking at purchasing is really worth it."}

But after around 4-5 months, one day  while my son was using it, the display changed to a screen with dark and light patches and looked like frozen. Being a computer wizard, I suspected the display screen and connected an external monitor and it displayed on the external monitor, When I contacted Acer customer support and provided them the pictures of the screen, the rep asked me to send the chrome book for repair. I sent by USPS shipping insured (It is your expense to send it even under warranty). Later, Acer called and told me that the display has cracked internally and it is not covered under warranty. I was disappointed as I don't think it is any thing to do with the usage. The chrome book was never dropped or mishandled.  Since the cost of repair quoted was ore than what I paid for the chrome book, I just asked them to return. Therefore, I believe display is of really poor quality."}

Inexcusable.\n\nWhile working on homework, the screen cracked. Did not drop or have any impact. They said it would be $119 for out of warranty repair, even though the product was only 8 months old and we did not create the issue. Seems like a poorly made component as I have had several laptops and not once has the screen \"cracked\" . We already had issues downloading non-chrome products, screen going black, computer freezing, etc. Will not be purchasing an ACER again. Waste of money. Take the $40 for self screen repair or $119 for them to repair and put it towards another computer."}

(um, like I need ANOTHER laptop?) But here's the thing. I find myself using this Chromebook more, and more. It's SIMPLE. It wakes-up from sleep mode faster. It connects to WiFi faster. The battery lasts longer. It doesn't get as HOT sitting on my lap. The \"Utility\" of it is so solid, basic, and useful, it is the Honda Civic of Daily Commuting when all the others are 18-wheeler Tractor-Trailers. (Sure,they haul more, do more, but I just need to carry ME).\n\nNow, I do have a Gmail account, but use my Yahoo 99% of the time. Chrome does that perfectly. I use Skype to chat with friends and co-workers A LOT. Does that perfectly. I use GDocs and Youtube daily, and the video playback is perfect. I do utilize the Google Calendar, and synch to my Android phone, so much convenience for being able to schedule my day.\n\nScreen-size, this screen is smaller, but built-in HDMI connects to my 36\" TV (WHOA!!) Problem solved. USB Keyboard and Mouse and this makes for a pretty darned nice mobile workstation. Acer has done a fantastic job overall with the engineering and usability of this unit.

So they are a military family with 4 children can not afford to buy her a new one at this time and can not afford to pay the 126.00 they wanted to fix it pluss the 20.00 they already had to pay to send it to them, that would end up costing 146.00 to fix a 179.00 computer come on how dumb is that  Thanks Acer for nothing ,they can't afford you.

I could not believe that this computer was so cheap, so I bought it for backup and traveling so I would not get my macbook stolen, and I ended up using this more than my other computer. It is extremely light and portable, and does everything I need for regular internet usage.\n\nThe feel of the computer is way more high quality than I expected. That being said it does not have as nice a keyboard as my macbook, and the screen quality is lower, but I found that the portability and price make up for it. It is also super energy efficient. I run this thing of my car inverter, and you can leave it plugged in while you run errands and come back to find a fully charged laptop and a not dead car. It really just sips the power.\n\nThe bootup time is nearly instant on this thing. It is really nice to be able to shut it down when I am not using it and have it kick back on pretty quick when I need it, no 3 minute boot time on this thing. The quality of the video is also really good. You can use VLC to watch downloaded movies, and there is not skipping or codec artifacts. I even tried playing a blu-ray quality movie and it ran just fine.\n\nIf I am doing anything complicated I use my other computer, I have notice this lacks a lot of support, but for every day surfing, streaming, and emailing this works perfectly. If you are the type to use a lot of computer accessories, especially obscure ones, or obscure programs, this computer is not for you. This computer is simply for browsing the regular internet, email, and streaming, and does it wonderfully."}

The screen would slowly open all the way to 180 degrees while in use.  I was constantly adjusting the angle.  The good news is mine was pretty easy to fix.  I removed the front bezel.  This exposed part of the hinge.  I then removed the bottom of the laptop, but that wasn't helpful.  Each hinge had a very small nut on the end of a bolt.  In my case, one of the nuts was completely loose.  I could spin it with my finger.  I tightened it as much as I could with my finger.  I then tried to use very small needle nose pliers, but the area was too small to pinch both sides.  So, I instead just use on side of the pliers as leverage to tighten another half turn.  It was enough.  Now, my screen is great.  No more sliding open."}

Case in point: Seemingly with no impact, something in my screen ruptured, causing a black, spidered splotch to appear on the screen, along with a large gray box and multicolored lines, rendering it unusable. When I looked at the help topics on Acer's website, I found this was a pretty common issue among users and it's not covered under their warranty and they'll charge you about $120 to fix it --not really worth it considering the original price of the computer.\n\nRIP little Chromebook. You were only 3 months old."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "Although I did not purchase from Amazon, I do use this chromebook extensively (and to type this).\n\nTwo reasons why it has one less star than 5:\n- The SD slot on the side does not insert all the way in. I wanted to stick an SD card in there and leave it there for permanent storage, but now I can't do that. Although they do have half-length microSD adapters, so that's an alternative.\n- Linux doesn't install on this chromebook natively. You'd have to use Crouton. Although it was my fault for not researching thoroughly enough, it's still a huge bummer.\n\nIt feels like a Macbook. Design is obviously closely based off of one.\nAnd the battery lasts FOREVER. A whole day of constant use before I have to recharge it. And it's cheap and lightweight.\nAlthough it's not what I expected, it's easily become my EDC laptop."}

I've had good luck with Acer products in the past and this is not exception.  The machine doesn't feel as well made/sturdy as previous devices I've owned. It's sturdy enough though that it doesn't feel like it's going to crumble.  As for ChromeOS, it's what I expected from it.  It works well for web browsing.  I only really bought this to play around and have a chrome based machine for testing stuff as needed.  It's a tertiary use device at best.  Based on use thus far, it's more than adequate.  Acer has always been good to me."}

My MacBook Pro is at the end of its life, so I got this to tide me over until I could save up for a new macbook.\n\nAnd I have been super pleased with it the 4 1/2 months Ive had it! It's perfect for what I need. It's super light and easy to travel with and everything works perfectly on it. I've never used a chromebook before, so there is definitely a lot to get used to, but since I'm only using it for internet purposes, it hasn't really been an issue. The matte screen is kind of strange and makes images look weird if you don't have the screen tilted just right, but that's just me being nit-picky.\n\nMy only complaint is that the HDMI port rarely works. If I persist, and keep un plugging it and plugging it back in, it will eventually show up on my tv after 30+ attempts. :( I was excited to not have to use the converter like i do with my mac, but if I want to hook it up to the tv i end up using the mac anyway since this part is not reliable.\n\nSo overall, I'm extremely pleased with this chromebook, especially since I only paid $95! I do however still intend to purchase a new macbook in the future for my primary computer needs, but will keep this one for traveling and surfing the web!"}

As in, I don't know if I'll ever be able to obtain and keep a job. This is why I give it one star. The 'select' button takes too much force to hit. I think this may be the case with all Chromebooks. This is unacceptable! I probably will have to have surgery to fix this, which takes months of recovery...and there's no guarantee that it will get better.\n\nThe good--I love how light and portable it is. And it charges quickly, and holds a full charge for about 8 hours I think. That's about it.\n\nThe bad--I have pretty fast internet. The Chromebook is usually very slow to load. I often use this to check movies at Rottentomatoes. I will put the cursor over the box where I type in the movie. It can take up to 30 seconds to allow me to type in. That's just crazy.\n\nHere are some of the glitches.\n1) It is set to select a link when you hover over it for a certain amount of time, even if you don't 'left-click'. Sometimes this happens when I'm over a link for well under a second, so it selects a link I don't want to select.\n2) It freezes fairly often.\n3) Sometimes it will just close out all my windows for no apparent reason.\n4) I tried to use a regular mouse with it, and it was incredibly slow. I'm not crazy about using the scrolling button at the bottom.\n5) Can't right click.\n6) No 'delete' key."}

It's small and lightweight, so he carries it around the house when he needs to, and he loves using Google Docs for his homework. We were able to connect it via wireless to our printer through Google Chrome, so there''s no problems printing. And videos on YouTube load extremely fast for such a cheap machine - even faster than on my much more expensive iMac.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "This chromebook had an attractive price tag, and serves its purpose, but I would get a different brand or model if I could have a redo. There is no contrast control, and there are many times when the screen appears white-washed, and you can't see certain parts of the information on the screen. This is particularly noticeable with underlining and outlining text, and in things like Calendar, Gmail, and Sheets. It doesn't help to adjust the brightness up or down, and reversing the brightness to have a high contrast screen is annoying because certain aspects of webpages look weird, like pictures, which appear like negatives."}

When I first got it the sound wasn't working at all and I had to search google to find out that sometimes (out of the box) the things are locked into headphones as the default sound output and you have to PLUG IN a pair of headphones to be able to access the setting that allows you to change the default output to the internal speakers."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "I love this computer and tell everyone to get one who needs a commuter machine or a school laptop. Light and thin enough to fit in my purse. Outstanding battery. Charges at the speed of light. Boots just as quickly. Never had problems with heat and I just hate fans so I like that this laptop doesn't have one. I think it looks cute and not cheapy; I put an iPearl case on it to make mine purple and I think it's adorable. Love that you can turn the display off. The sound is a little quiet (and speakers are on the bottom) but it works well for streaming video none the less. Love that it has an HDMI and I think it handles HDMI hook up easily and seamlessly, it has some nice options for how to use it when it's hooked up to another display. You can even shut the laptop down to preserve your battery life while it displays to another screen. A lot of people say the ports are in weird locations, but they make sense to me. Be aware of the limitations of the OS though before you buy so you're not disappointed. Understand that some video/audio formats won't play and that you can't just install any program you might be used to using. That said, there is an app for everything and the chromebook compatibility is expanding day by day.  I also don't think that running chrome limits one too much when you're not in WiFi range, because you can save a few things locally and how many documents do you really need at a moment's notice anyway? That said, I'm using this for word processing and not photo editing or gaming or anything like that."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "I was wary about getting this at first since Chromebooks are supposed to have limited functions compared to your standard laptop. After using a laptop for 4 years, it was time to upgrade to a new device and this product stood out to me for not only its price but its positive reviews. I've had it for about two months now, and I've gotten over the initial awkward stage of learning how to use it. Now that I know its pros and cons, I feel confident in saying that I do recommend this product. Pros: lightweight (lighter than some of my notebooks, much lighter than my textbooks), fast to boot up (none of that loading nonsense when you close your regular Windows laptops), great battery life (the little engine that could), and visually appealing (matte finish is really nice). Cons: white (prone to smudges), limited space for files (although making the switch to using Google Drive to save files was not that difficult). I was initially concerned that I would not be able to do my work on here, but with Office 365 Online, I can do anything I would usually do with a PC without the laptop being slowed down with multiple programs. This thing stays fast and has a ton of random, fun features (the keyboard shortcuts are my favorite!). Overall, quirky and different alternative to bulky, traditional laptops. Give it a try, you most likely will like it."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "OK, this was a replacement for the original iPad, which I couldn't expand, update the iOS, kept crashing, new apps requiring iOS7+, etc.\nI found a majority of my pad usage is web browsing and email, so a chromebook seemed like a good fit.  The Acer was on sale and I had some money on an Amazon gift card, so my net cost was just under a hundred bucks.  My initial reaction was not positive as the screen has a pretty bad vertical \"screen door\" effect - changing contrast (and color!) depending on the viewing angle.  The screen was (and is) a disappointment as compared to the iPad.  Once I got the viewing angle correct, the pluses, for my use, justified the switch.  News and general web browsing is now a breeze, as all websites load fast and display everything (including Flash).  The attached keyboard is just excellent.  I've finally gotten used to not swiping the screen and have figured out touchpad and alt/ctrl/arrow keys shortcuts, so navigation is seamless.  An actual qwerty keyboard is welcome as I'm old school there and the feel is very good for a tablet.\nBottom line, considering cost and usage, this chromebook was a very good replacement for my original iPad."}

It feels cheap and flimsy, it doesn't stay inserted very well, and we all know the charger/plug is the first piece to go bad on any electronic device. Second, the touch pad mouse is not consistent and feels like it may be the second piece which will break. When you press and hold to click and drag onscreen, the touch pad feels like it is sinking deeper into the base. Yet, when i use the gentle tap to click option, i cannot smoothly scroll down a page. It winds up jumping and feels choppy. This is not a good thing for someone who constantly scrolls. It's tough to look at online shopping sites or read long news articles. Such a shame!

Even though the specs may appear weak at first, but for running ChromeOS it's actually very generous. Booting up takes seconds, pages open instantly, apps launch quickly, system updates take seconds. For the performance and price, you cannot go wrong."}

However, I left it unattended in the presence of my one year old for just a minute or two and something must of happened because now it won't work.  There was no return policy on this item after a month.  So I ordered another one.  However, when I received it the outer and inner seals were broken.  The Chromebook looked in good condition, but my husband and I have tried everything and it won't work.  It turns on and that's as far as we can get it to go.  I am now returning it."}

So far this PC proves to be very stable and responsive, which is probably due to its light operating system and the good functionality of the OS. I don't play computer games so for me productivity apps are all that matters. To that regard, I'm very satisfied with the offering: I can use Open Office, Google Docs or the web-based MS Office applications. To my opinion, this PC is almost a steal for what it can offer. As a 2nd PC, I strongly recommend it."}

The speed is quite impressive and I've found the apps to adequately replace anything that I could do on my Asus laptop that quit after 3 months. However, this model does not mirror when I hook-up to HDMI cord. I have tried contacting the website, left messages. tried to chat with tech support, to no avail. I mailed in a registration warranty card but the website doesn't recognize the serial number, when I try to re-register online I get the same result. So I guess I have a product with no warranty, with a company that won't recognize the product....or me. I can live with the HDMI problem since I have another laptop that this feature does work on, it just sucks that a company doesn't respond when you need them. It's most likely a settings fix that can easily be corrected but I'll never know if they won't talk to me. So 4 stars for the unit as it works so far, and 1 star for customer service on their website.\nUPDATE: 5-4-17 Well,I never did a get that response from the company and about 2 months ago the space bar developed a sticking problem that makes typing anything a real chore. I use it mainly for browsing now and go to my other one for regular use. I'm 70 yrs.old,stay at home always,so this has limited use."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "Nice little laptop.  At first, I was frustrated by the fact that you can't download any programs at all.  I knew big programs, such as Word, could not be loaded onto a chromebook.  However, I didn't realize you couldn't download chat programs or Skype or any real apps - there are work arounds such as using the web versions of some programs but those are usually not as robust and have a different \"feel\" or don't have windows that float over anything you are looking at.  However, once you accept this is a chromebook limitation (or a plus, depending on how you look at it), the laptop itself is great.  It holds a very long battery charge (over 10 hours).  It's very speedy - goes on quick and there is no lag at all on the internet.\n\nI have a regular laptop for home use but I use this one for travel.  One benefit of a chromebook is you won't leave personal documents in it as you store everything on the cloud.  Therefore, there is a lower risk if the laptop is lost or stolen.  Also, the fact that it is so small and light makes it easy to carry around during travel.  Because it isn't very expensive (and its loss wouldn't be devastating since there's hardly anything on the hard drive), I have the option of throwing it in my luggage - something I'd never do with my main laptop.\n\nI also find it is convenient to have around for guests who want to check their e-mails.  They can sign in without leaving personal information behind (a chromebook feature for guest logons).  For the reasons stated above, I also don't mind handing it over to kids, whereas I might hover over them if they were using my main laptop.\n\nBottom line if you want speed, a small laptop, and don't need to be able to download programs, this little laptop give excellent value."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase. I'm still getting the hang of the whole Chrome OS thing - this is definitely NOT a replacement for a standard PC. I know a lot of people use it that way, but I just don't see how. It's just too difficult to be tethered to a wifi connection, and there's no replacing the functionality of the full ms office suite. I see it more as a peripheral for my main machine, and it's great to have on-hand when toting my 17\" just isn't practical. The size and weight are absolutely unbeatable, and it gets amazing battery life. It hasn't been the machine I was hoping for in terms of productivity, but it's still very well worth the price. If nothing else, I prefer it to an iPad for web browsing, and it's a fraction of the cost."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "I won't lie, I really liked this when I first got it, but I've had it for about three months now, and it is becoming increasingly aggravating. The longer I own it, the more obvious its limitations are, and despite constantly clearing the history, cache and cookies, and making sure I don't have too many files on it's (teeny tiny) harddrive, it just keeps freezing more and more often. The limited RAM is much more of a problem now than it was when I first got it. There doesn't seem to be a way to load anti-virus on it, so I can't tell if that is the issue, but it just crashed for about the three hundredth time in the last three months and lost part of a story I was working on. I bought it to write with, so this is a problem. I don't know if this is an issue with all chromebooks, or just this particular one, but I definitely will be going with a \"real\" laptop for my next computer."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "This is a very eye opening product for me, and I think for anyone who has been a traditional and loyal Microsoft Windows user. I have been using computers since long before Windows 95 came along, and I know Windows very well. I didn't know anything about this product until using it over the last month.\n I checked the following features that I normally expect a Windows based laptop to do:\n1) Can I attach an external keyboard and mouse? Yes, as long as they are USB or Bluetooth based. Works great!\n2) Can I plug a USB thumb drive into this computer? Yes! This was surprising to me, but I took a thumb drive and plugged it into the USB port on my Windows 8.1 desktop, copied a .TXT, .DOC, .XLS, .PDF, and .JPG file onto it. Then I ejected the thumb drive and plugged it into the Acer Chromebook and it was able to seamlessly read the thumb drive and process each of the files so I could read them. Even Microsoft's .DOC and .XLS. It even converted the .DOC to .DOCX for me. Wow!\n3) Can I use an external monitor or TV with this laptop? Yes! As long as it is HDMI based. I plugged an HDMI cable into this laptop and then into my 55\" Samsung HDTV and successfully used it as a monitor.\n\n Now onto Google Chrome. It is very easy to learn because it is intuitive and simple. Google Chrome OS doesn't have near the features that Windows has, but it has all of the features you need to surf the web, check email, play music, create documents, spreadsheets, slide presentations, etc. It will also work with any of the other cloud based software tools out there like Office Online. I thought about calling this a \"Cloudbook\" because you don't really install software on this product. After all, it only has a 16GB drive! Everything is done on the web. I really like that the Google apps all auto save your work. You literally never have to worry about saving. It keeps track of your progress right down to the keystroke. One benefit of having such a light weight OS is that it boots in about 12 seconds, and shuts down in 5-6 seconds. One down side to being a Cloudbook is that you can't run iTunes, or another browser like FireFox, which I actually prefer to Chrome. I did read, though, that Google will help you lift all of your music out of iTunes so that you can play it on a Google Chrome device. Another difference from Windows is that Printing is accomplished in a different way on a Chromebook. You can print, but not via WiFi to a WiFi printer or via USB. Instead you connect to Google Cloud Print service and do it from there. So not very straight forward and kind of a drawback if you need to print a lot. You can also buy an ePrint enabled printer. There are plenty of instructions on the internet that will guide you through setup. Another thing that I noticed is that the concept of patching the OS, security updates, viruses, etc don't appear to be a problem with Chrome OS, which is a HUGE benefit.\n\nIn summary, this is a great product at a great price. I have owned a NetBook, and this is much better because it is lighter, thinner, faster, and much easier to use. I think this product makes a great web surfer that you keep in between the cushions of your couch so you can look stuff up at a moment's notice. Just close the lid and it goes to sleep. Open the lid and it wakes right back up. I think this product could even be used as a cheap student laptop since a child could research things on the web, type a paper, copy files to a USB thumb drive, print, etc. Using this product for a month, and hearing the comments from family members has changed the way I look at Chrome OS, and I definitely see a place for Chromebook(s) in our technology stack here at home. Don't be afraid of the web based device. Its the future and the future is now."}

For a basic laptop, mine works great! It's version of a typing document is amazing, and saved my butt at least twice. On many document writers, once you delete a page and it's saved, the document is gone. But mine had a system error and I thought I lost my resume. Lo and behold, I just had to find the \"change history\" and found the most recent 12 updates (auto saves) on the document and was able to get everything back!\n\nIf you don't get online much or have very basic computer needs, the Acer Chromebook is a good find, and one that is easy to understand. It's light enough I can carry it in one hand. It takes less than a minute to start up from power off, and can comfortably keep open multiple tabs. (I regularly have upwards of 20, and have almost no issues.) It charges for me in use after about 2 hours, and less when it's turned off. I would recommend it to anyone."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "[The first part is about the older CB3-111 model]\nI bought this on \"cyber Monday\" when it was on sale. It's probably the best computing device I ever bought below a hundred dollars.\nYou can get work done on this device, edit documents, or answer email. You can watch a YouTube video, for instance of a dude complaining about not being able to edit videos on a Chromebook. Add a Chromecast for under forty bucks and you can use it to play Netflix videos on your TV (Google is in the process of improving support for this, it's working well in the current beta)\n\nAt 10-15% of the price of a Macbook Air I cannot find much to complain about, but here are my pluses and minuses:\n\n+ very usable keyboard, I can touch type on this without trouble\n+ track pad works well, noisy clicks\n+ good Wi-Fi sensitivity (plastic helps here)\n+ Bluetooth works without problems\n+ speakers are loud enough, but oddly placed on the bottom of the device\n+ screen folds back far enough when used on your lap\n+ good battery life\n+ light and portable\n+ screen is not wobbly\n\n- viewing angles are limited on this type of display\n- movies look a bit murky on the screen, details in dark scenes get lost.\n- web browsing a bit slow on some crappy web sites with lots of video (CNN, the Verge)\n- 16GB of storage is a bit limiting\n- build quality is not the best I have ever seen, but should be OK\n\nThis is a Chromebook, a device that mostly needs the Internet to be of much use, but you can still edit documents or read a book while offline. Watching movies offline is limited to movies bought from Google. If you can live with that go for it. Otherwise save your money.\n\n[UPDATE] The 2016 update is definitely worth the $10 price difference. The screen is a lot better for watching a movie; if you insert an SD card it sits flush with the case, so you can leave it in. The hinges have been replaced with metal ones, and back of the screen is protected by a sheet of aluminum, so the build quality has improved a bit. It's still not a high end device, but it's perfectly adequate for reading and answering web mail, online reading, Youtube watching and more.\n\nBTW: the Wi-Fi works really well on this device, I used it as an interactive terminal for a number of hours yesterday (ssh) and I did not experience any slowdowns. File downloads are fast too."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "When I bought this I was deciding between it and a Macbook Air. I was worried about learning the Chrome OS. I'm not a particularly savvy computer person. I prefer to use something, and have it work. I don't care for the whys or hows. But for the price difference I was willing to give it a shot.\nThe only things I do on my computer are watch downloaded tv shows, browse the internet, and read. I have the added complication of having satellite internet, which has a data cap.\n\nA brief, simplistic, non-techie description of chrome. It's like all you have on your computer is Firefox. And you can get little widgets for your dashboard if you want. There's a basic video and music player built in, but you can also get VLC.\n\nRegrets: You can't schedule your updates, which kills my data. This regret ONLY applies to satellite internet people, not hotspots etc.\nThere's a new Don't Starve and I can't play it.\nEvery time I mirror my computer it notifies me. Like I'm dumb. Even though I turned off that notification.\nThe screen quality is way less than a macbook. The colors are dull and it's noticeably less sharp. But it's also matte. And it's worth it to no longer be accidentally making eye contact with myself.\n\nThe Best Things:\n\nNo longer needing computer insurance. If you break it, just buy a new one.\nThe cloud. I only have/had a vague idea about what this meant for me. Now what it means is that I could lose this computer. Buy another. And log on to pretty much the exact same computer in a day. Every file, every setting, every photo, is automatically saved to your google drive (if you want it to be). Your chromebook just helps you access it. You can do plenty offline. Then it'll just update when you get back online, no worries.\nThe $1200 dollars you just saved.\n\nAnd this is the cheapest chromebook. I can't imagine that the more expensive ones are nicer. This one is sweetly made and doesn't feel cheap. I haven't had to restart for three months and have never experienced any lags."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "At first I loved this computer: it's small, light, perfect for school and work.  I always took great care of my computer, and kept it in a protected carrying case when traveling with it.  After 6 months, the problems with the screen started.  At first, there were just a few lines on my computer screen; annoying, yes, but not a huge deal until they started spreading across the screen.  Then one day I opened my computer and the whole screen was grey and it wouldn't turn on.  I called Acer (since the computer was under warranty for such issues).  Their warranty is apparently worthless.  They claimed that there must have been physical damage to the computer for the monitor to stop working like that.  I explained there were no cracks, dents, or any signs of damage and the computer was (other than the monitor not working) in great shape.  They said they would not honor their warranty and I'd have to pay $119 to fix the $150 computer  ridiculous considering it was more than half of what I paid for the computer!  I got this computer to try out the Chromebook.  I like the idea of it.  I have a more expensive computer I use for heavier work, but I figured having a spare Chromebook around was a good idea.  With other companies which honor their warranty, this may be the case.  However my experience with Acer has not only influenced me to never buy their Chromebook again, but to never buy any other of their other, more expensive products, and to advise my friends to follow suite.  I used to work in computer support and have had to deal with a lot of warranty issues, but I've never had to deal with a company not honoring a warranty like this before.  If you're getting the computer for very light and temporary use, I'd consider this or other Acer computers, but if your planning on using this computer or any Acer computer for more than a month, hope that it doesn't break because Acer does not honor warranties as easily as other companies."}

As a college student I often need to take my laptop to classes and the library to do my work. Having to carry around both my laptop and textbooks doesn't leave much room in my backpack for anything else I might need. I tried just using my ipad instead of the laptop, but then I couldn't do everything I needed to do because sometimes you need something with a keyboard and something that you can use to easily print from.\n\nThis suits my needs perfectly! It connects to wifi easily and it is easy to use because it is basically just the Chrome browser. Printing is easily done using Google's cloud printing service; at my college we use a web based printing service and it works perfectly. The Chromebook starts up quickly, even quicker if it is just waking up from sleep. It came with 100GB of free storage on Google Drive and if you prefer using Dropbox you can also add it as one of your storage locations. Google Docs works flawlessly and if you prefer using Word, I have used this with Office 365 online and successfully used both Word and Excel with no problems. YouTube works great, but sites like Hulu and Netflix can't be streamed in HD, only SD, this is a limitation of those particular websites and not the Chromebook. The battery life is incredible, I don't need to worry about having to bring the charger with me, it's basically got a full day's worth of charge.\n\nPlease understand that this Chromebook is not a computer in the traditional sense of a desktop or laptop. If you don't intend to do anything that requires higher end hardware like audio/video editing or gaming, than this might be something for you. If you only need something to surf the web or to work with documents, than you should seriously consider purchasing this very inexpensive, lightweight, and extremely portable Chromebook."}

I originally got this for school work, but realized I couldn't use it when it wouldn't let me open up a few applications that were necessary. I continue to use it for writing, browsing, music and movies. It's very light weight and small which makes it so convenient to take everywhere (it's a good companion to have on flights, especially because the battery lasts a long time). It's extremely durable, I haven't had any issues with it when I have dropped it from lowish surfaces. Unfortunately the sound started going out a couple months ago. I was very happy with the sound, but now it's very low and faint even on the highest volume. This could be my fault, seeing as I have dropped it a few times ( not sure if that affects anything), but I can't say for sure.  Also, I was told I could find a way to get skype on here but it's been nearly impossible, so google hangouts has had to do. If you want something portable that will allow you to do simple browsing and writing then this will be great for you. Just remember that the only apps you can get are on the chrome store, which isn't much honestly."}

I don't know if my unit was a lemon or if this is just a bad model all around, but I had a lot of problems with this Chromebook and ended up returning it.\n\nIt glitched on install--right out of the box.\n\nSo I had to 'powerwash' it and start over.\n\nAnd it was just SLOW. I need to have lots of tabs open for my work. Previous Chromebooks haven't had an issue, but this one choked, constantly.\n\nPages loaded painfully slow--like I had dial up from 1990. The mouse was weird and didn't track well.\n\nThe final straw was when the mouse became unresponsive. It just stopped showing up on the screen. Eventually whatever was locked up resolved and I was able to 'powerwash' the unit once again, this time so I could return it.\n\nI then bought the same model I had previously which was a great Chromebook (and also an Acer!). It handled multiple windows and tabs without blinking. I used it all over the place for work (most famously, frantically fixing a problem at work in the backseat of a car on our way to Shark Valley National Park in Florida).  The only thing was I killed it with, I kid you not, ONE drop of water.

The Acer chromebook 11 was one of the finalist when I was choosing a lightweight, portable, and good looking laptop. I was also considering a Windows Lenovo think pad which is in the same price range  as this one.\nThe reason I went for the Acer Chromebook 11 is for its simpler interface and supposedly better security by Google. As many have mentioned, please look into what a Chrome OS is. It is definitely not for everyone. For me, who browses the Internet, uses MS Office Online, stream HD movies from time to time, this laptop is perfect. IMPORTANT! Since it is a web based browser, ads take a lot of time loading and slows the computer down. Download AdBlock and you will notice a significant increase in performance.\nThe only con is that the keyboard is not backlit. I have been able to use it just fine though. The light from the screen is sometimes enough to see the keyboard.\nI purchased the laptop at a brick and mortar store since they price matched Amazon."}

I bought it to transfer pix of items I have for sale into online auction and selling sites - strictly Internet use.  I have only one tiny issue and that's that there is no DELETE button.  You have to hold down ALT and push BACKSPACE.  ALT+CTRL and BACKSPACE deletes a whole word.  It's a keyboard issue that you just have to learn.  Also, I kept hitting the Google Apps key which is where Caps Lock is on a normal keyboard.  The screen would go all screwy as I as typing descriptions, but then I discovered you can switch that Apps key to Caps Lock in Settings, which I did, and now I have no problems.  Other than a couple keyboard issues I had to learn, it's the best $199.99 computer purchase I ever made.  Chrome OS has built-in anti-virus and updates.  No waiting when you turn it on, or watching a little circle go 'round and 'round.  Close the lid when you're done, and when you open the lid back up, sign in, and resume where you left off.  You can drag & drop App icons that you use alot into the bottom tool bar for easy access.  Google Docs is the same as Word.  I could go on & on, bottom line - if you're fed up w/Windows and I.E. - go Chromebook!  It's light and fits easily in my old laptop briefcase.  P.S. Amazon purchase & delivery was flawless, as so often is the case."}

The machine runs perfectly fine for the lower end components. Personally, I wish I could upgrade the RAM, but it isn't a big deal.\n\nI got this chromebook because it was over a 10\" screen, $100, and was new. I didn't want anything smaller, more expensive, or used. The screen runs at 1366x768 I believe, so the lower power CPU is able to handle it quite well. I did try hooking it up to my 2560x1080 ultrawide monitor. It worked fairly well, but there is noticeable stuttering from the CPU trying to keep up to the massive pixel increase. It still played videos pretty well at 480p.\n\nAs for my main purpose for this chromebook, it's a cheap laptop I can leave in my bed to watch crunchyroll on. That's it. It works great!\n\nAs for things I don't like, I only have one. I really don't like the viewing angle of the screen. For normal computing, it's prefect. For watching movies though, you have to tilt the screen at an extreme angle so as not to have the photo negative effect at the top. This makes the bottom a little too whited out, but it's watchable.\n\nFor $100 (black Friday), or even the normal $150, I would say this is worth it. The screen issue wasn't bad enough to take away a star."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "This review is for the Acer Chromebook 11 CB3-111-C670.\n\nThe number of positive reviews far outweighed the negative, and the price ($99.99) was right, so I decided to purchase the Chromebook. My primary reason for purchasing was to have something light and portable that I could use to compose Word type documents offline and then upload them to Google Drive when I was back home. I bought a silicone keyboard cover and a case for it to keep it well protected. The keyboard is a little hard to get used to, especially with the silicone cover, but despite slowing me down, I was still able to do what I wanted.\n\nThe reason I bring up the silicone cover is because after 2 - 3 weeks of occasional use, one of the keys stopped working. It is a complete cover, with no space between the keys and it prevented debris, dust, or food from getting under the keys, so this wasn't the reason for the key to stop working.\n\nUnfortunately for me, the key that doesn't work was one of the keys I needed to input a WiFi password. A cold reboot didn't work, nor did a Factory Reset (which an Acer tech support rep was kind enough to help me with). Now I have to send the Chromebook to Texas (this is where it goes; there are no local authorized repair locations) for repair. Since I don't live in Texas, I must ship it there.\n\nPlease be aware that even if your Chromebook is covered under warranty, the shipping, packing materials, and insurance (all highly recommended or required) are completely out of pocket.\n\nI mention the lack of a DELETE key because I wasn't aware that Chromebooks don't have this key, but this is not the reason for the 1-star rating.\n\nThe review technically ends here, and I think if not for the issue with the keys, I'd have been happy with it just like many other reviewers. I find the cost of using the warranty coverage unacceptable, especially after so little time has passed.\n\nBelow I am including an excerpt from my repair ticket instructions, should this help you decide if the product is right for you. I will update this review when I receive the product back after repair.\n\n[Acer recommends:]\nUsing 3 to 5 inches of bubble wrap to protect your product.\nUsing 3 inch wide plastic packing tape or 3 inch wide reinforced water-activated paper tape to seal the box.\n\n[Acer then points out that] The following are issues that can cause damage not covered by your Standard Manufacturers Warranty and we highly recommend;\nDo not use Carrier Mail Packs.\nDo not use Envelopes.\nDo not use Styrofoam popcorn or peanuts.\n\nShipping your Acer Product [also recommended by Acer]\nUse a Trackable Carrier Only (Fedex, UPS, Purolator, etc.) We highly discourage the use of the postal service.\nKeep a copy of your Airbill/Waybill; it is your only proof of shipment.\nWe recommend that you insure your package; any damage incurred in shipping will not be covered under the Standard Manufacturers Warranty. If your product is damaged in shipping,  you will need to contact your carrier to file a claim."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "I purchased this over the weekend after Thanksgiving on special for $95.  I wanted to see how the Chromebooks worked and if the processor would provide adequate browsing speed.  I did not expect much, but let me tell you that this is a great little machine.  It is super fast for web browsing, which is basically all it is used for in my home.  I have not used google docs yet, but I am looking forward to exploring the options.  I guess there is not a lot of hard drive space, but you can connect by USB or SD card slot for additional storage or use the cloud service that is available from Google.  There is also an HDMI connection.  The navigating pad is a little different than a traditional laptop, but after a little practice, you will wonder why they are not all made to function like this pad does.  Screen if very clear and I frequently watch streaming sporting events without any issues.  The screen is a little small, but that is the best part about the product.  It is so small and light that when I use my regular laptop, it feels like it weighs a ton.  The only average thing about this Chromebook is the sound.  It is just ok and probably functions well enough for what you are getting here.  The battery lasts forever and it is a sharp looking product.\n\nI could see this being a great computer for anyone of any age!  Overall, I highly recommend it for web browsing and light document preparation.  I was more than pleasantly surprised by how great this Chromebook functions.  I wish I bought more of them at the ridiculous holiday price and would definitely purchase an additional one at the regular price...it is that good!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "I've been pleasantly surprised by this Chromebook and glad I made the switch. I always had a Windows-based computer, but I realized after my last computer purchase that I basically only used it for surfing the web, printing documents, and video chatting. All the other features were going to waste and I was being bogged down by the resource hogging Windows OS when I didn't need to be. I think a lot of the people who are giving it one star and saying \"this stupid computer can't play my games or install this program!\" didn't take the two seconds to research what a Chromebook is about. If you want a (relatively) fast laptop that is easy to use and will let you search the web all day long, get a Chromebook. If you need to install random games/programs, buy a Mac or Windows-based PC. I'm sure there are hardware or software malfunctions for some users with this computer that deserve the one star reviews much like any product, but the amount of reviews giving it one star simply because someone didn't do any sort of research beyond seeing the cheaper price is mind-boggling.\n\nJust a heads up to potential buyers, Acer is coming out with a new version in February that is more rugged if you can wait that long. I wish I would have waited, but I'm not going to knock off a star or two just because I didn't do the best research :)"}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "This chromebook has about a 2 year life expectancy with full time use. It was a terrific device when I first got it - so terrific, in fact, I bought two. But now, they unexpectedly turn off when you're working.

But when I tried my husband's mac and a few friends' laptops, I see now it's the chromebooks that have slowed down, not the internet. My C720 is holding up a bit better, but not by much.\n\nChromebooks are definitely cheaper than laptops, and it seems like you get a much better value with them.

Handles multiple tabs open without a problem (I've got ~30 open right now). The touchpad shortcuts are AWESOME, probably my favorite thing about the machine; being able to scroll page, tabs, right click, etc with only a pad and no buttons is very cool and much easier to use once you get used to it. Great battery life.\n\nNeutral\nIt's nice to have an SD card slot, but it's annoying having the SD card stick halfway out. I don't think it would have been difficult for the designers to make the card flush with the machine.\n\nCons\nA lot of programs that I use on my Win7 laptop won't work on my chromebook, which I knew ahead of time, but I thought there would be more replacements available in the Chrome Store. The available apps in the Chrome Store is pretty limited and basic, especially the media player apps, which are seriously lacking. There are a lot of video formats that don't work or need a specific app to play; there's not one media app that plays them all. I don't like that the majority of apps open in the chrome browser, something that I don't think I will get used to. The keyboard is very minimalist and there are keys I used a lot that were replaced with shortcuts or removed all together, such as, PgDn, PgUp, Del, Home, End. The brightness keys, switch to next window key, and forward/backward keys are not very useful to me and would have been better off as shortcuts in my opinion. The file browsing interface is very basic and difficult to see specific properties of files and connected drives.\n\nOverall, it's a fun machine, worth the money spent if you're not planning on using it for anything but browsing the web. I purchased the chromebook because my laptop of 10 years finally died on me. Unfortunately this machine will not replace my antiquated laptop, so I wish I would have saved the $180 and put it towards the laptop I still need to buy."}

The ChromeOS software will be perfectly sufficient for most people's needs in a laptop, but be sure to fully research advantages/limitations of ChromeOS before investing in a Chromebook. With that said, this was an excellent purchase. I was looking for something small, lightweight , and with a good battery to use while I am traveling.\n\nPROS\nGreat size to be able to easily take with you without occupying much space.\nBattery life is amazing. I get on average 8-10 hours\nGreat integration with Google Suite - Docs, Drive, Photos, etc.\nProduces no heat what-so-ever after sitting in my lap\nScreen is great. I wasn't sure I would like the matte screen, but after some time I think I like it better than the glossy screens.\n\nCONS\nThe plastic casing doesnt seem the most sturdy i've ever owned. I am coming to this from a Ideapad, which had a metal casing, so going to a thinner plastic had me concerned. I bought one of the clear snap-on cases (also on amazon) which I think will do great in protecting the chromebook.\nThe only cons I can find aren't associated with the the chromebook itself, and more of limitations with the ChromeOS software (for instance, not being able to use my own printer since its not Google Cloud ready)"}

Though it's a netbook, it still has some storage space for files, but I choose to use Google Drive so I can access files anywhere. The startup is faster than any computer I've ever used. Chrome OS is easy and fast; I now prefer it over Windows.\n\nOne downside: Chrome needs to add more extensions. I've encountered vendors who've only made software for Windows and Mac. Until Chrome creates a large enough presence to entice vendors to build compatible software, it will be a third-place competitor. Essentially, you'll still need a PC or Mac to fully function."}

I have a small lapotop bag and it is such a pleasure. I do a lot of walking and I barely notice the weight of the chromebook.\n\nGetting internet connections is very simple. I have already used this at home, work and a few hotpots with no issues. I was very surprised by how fast this could connect to the internet. Another feature I liked was speed. Since it is so fast to connect and stay connected, on special vacation days, I let my girls steam a show. There is no loading time or pauses in the middle of the movies. This alone is worth the purchase.\n\nThe screen is nice and will not reflect the surroundings like light bulbs and the battery is amazing. I can have the battery charged in such a short time and have it run for hours. So far I have used it three hours at a time and noticed I had about half the battery life left.\n\nSo far so good. This machine is my gateway to the internet. In addition to bringing it with me when I am on the run, I also have it on hand when I am working.

In fact, I think the specced 8.5-hour battery life might actually be understating it - mine has been lasting longer than that.\n\nHowever, there are two small flaws that made me take one star off this review. First, there is what feels like a grain of sand *under* the top layer of the touchpad, forming a small bump which, while it doesn't affect the operation of the touchpad, is slightly annoying to feel as I'm scrolling.\n\nSecond, and this more an issue with small chromebooks than with this particular model, hitting \"home\" or \"end\" is a 3-key key combo (ctrl+alt+up/down). Even on other, smaller laptops I've owned before, home/end were only at most, 2-key combos, which is an issue for me as I use them a lot in my editing."}

The delivery and cost of the product was perfect, if it was 100% in working condition, this isn't the sellers problem. Its an Acer glitch. I would recommend the product and seller."}

I and many other chromebook users would disagree. this is a standalone laptop that has the capabilities of every other laptop. The only difference between the chromebook and other laptops is the brand. for the price, you basically get this product for free. it is an amazing laptop for an amazing price. i am a chromebook fan for its simplicity and ease of everyday use. I purchased a gmyle rainbow keyboard cover and a pink iPearl mCover to compliment my acer chromebook and it works just as beautiful as it looks. thank the heavens. it runs fast. the battery life is simply unbelievable. I was able to use it all day running numerous programs without a single charge. I've never been able to do that with my apple. it's affordable and simply charming. i love it."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "Disappointed, I purchased this thinking it would be good for school. I was WRONG. After 2 months of having it and using it gently, the screen cracked when I pushed it to adjust it. The warranty doesn't cover it and of course Acer says it is not a defect in workmanship. I purchased it for $115 roughly and it cost more than what I paid for the item to have the screen fixed. The Acer customer service representative had poor customer service as well. I'm EXTREMELY disappointed and have to recommend that you just spend a little more $ and get a better quality product!"}

It is simple. this thing does one thing and it does it really well. there is no complication to it you open the hood, you start browsing.\n2. the battery lasts for a really long time it has given me 8-10 hours of play time.\n3. its really compact and lightweight. More so than the macbook air. I realised how big the bezels for the macbook air are.\n4. The viewing angles on the screen are really not that good. but what do you want for 95 bucks or even 160 for that matter. seriously.\n\nThere is some intangible quality of simplicity which just works for this thing.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "This computer is great... if you don't actually need a functional pc. The chromebook can only function with google apps, since google is a greedy company. It cannot, CANNOT use Word, PowerPoint, Excel, Outlook, etc. Additionally, you can't actually download files. No drivers, no pdfs, no nothing. You have to find \"apps\" on the web store that do the same job, only less effieciently, slower, and not for free. But the computer functions great as a Google iPad with a keyboard. It boots up fast and games work well on it... except it can't be used for anything without strong wi-fi. Not those free coffee shop wifi, strong home wireless connection. So to reiterate, this is just a google iPad with a better browser function that can't download anything at all."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "I got this laptop on black friday for $99 but its price is back to $170. Honestly I'd be totally comfortable paying maybe $250 for this. As far as aesthetics and purpose the plastic is a flat matte plastic finish that keeps finger prints off.  The screen is also a finger print resistant plasma type screen.  The keyboard is so responsive and the chicklet keys sound and feel amazing.  Honestly this laptop has the look and feel of a mac with a much better operating system.  I use this laptop for school work and college papers.  I already used docs and all of google's productivity stuff so I didn't need to be converted.  If you're used to microsoft word I cannot explain how much easier google docs is.  BUT i had never used Chome OS before and I was worried.\n\nI was really skeptical about chromebooks and I've only used windows os.  This is an incredible laptop.  Chrome OS is amazing, fast, clean, and user friendly.  It's gotta be the only operating system that gives you a quick tutorial but honestly its completely unnecessary.  The whole interface is so simple and i can still have my apps bar on the bottom like in windows (or mac).\n\nThe reason the RAM and hard drive are so low is because they're completely unnecessary.  The apps that you download are actually hyperlinks that take you to a website version of the app.  This is because hyperlinks are super small and take up very little space whereas apps can take up alot of hard drive space.  The hard drive is so small because everything you download, write, all your pictures, everything goes to google drive online.  You can make things available to you offline by downloading them from google drive.  The RAM is so low because its literally just chrome running as the os opening hyperlinks.  so when you close your apps and browser, nothing is left running.  It starts up in less than four seconds.\n\nI was really worried that spotify and slack wouldn't be available because of google music and other google productivity apps but they are available.  I was actually able to look at my phone's apps and download them all as apps on my laptop."}

A few things is pretty nice, the keyboard is nicely placed, its fast for what it does, its very light yet the construction feels nice and sturdy. The JetDrive Lite 330 TS64GJDL330 fits with some modification, check the photos. Its overall a great \"basic\" computer and laptop if you don't need to much out of a laptop. I only have a few issues.\nPros:\nBuild: Pretty awesome build quality especially for the price, I was actually expecting much much worse. Its sturdy, no weird sounds coming out of it when moving it around. Screen moves with ease. Very nice overall.\nKeyboard: The keyboard has a nice clicky feel to it, spaced very well, overall very easy to type. Wish it was backlit but for the price can't be expected.\nSimple: This has to do with ChromeOS, I like the simplicity, I bought this as the extra laptop and a guest computer but really i've enjoyed using it.\nScreen: Low resolution but good viewing angles color is OK, pretty bright for being so small.\n\nIssues:\n2GB Ram: This is my first Chromebook as stated above and at first using it seemed fine for what I needed to do. Once I played around with a 4GB version now I with I would have gotten that, HOWEVER don't let that stop you from getting the 2GB version if you get a great deal like i did ($99) just something you'll have to live with. At the price I got I'd say I cant complain expect for one issue....\nSoldered on RAM and SSD: I understand that it helps make the Chromebook light and \"better\" but sucks for because you can upgrade it. There are other Chromebooks that offer the ability to do upgrades yourself. The RAM not being upgraded is the biggest issue for me as I saw what the difference was from 2 GB to 4GB after the fact.\nWhite: I love the color but at the same time makes it look cheap ,it is cheap after all and I wasn't expecting much more.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "I purchased this as a Black Friday deal for under $100.\n\nI am still not quite sure what to make of Chrome OS. I think for most people, a Chromebook really could take care of all of their computing needs. As long as you are a willing Google user, you have a full suite of office apps, a good browser (which let's face it is where 80% of the time is spent on a computer), and that's about it. The things that it can't do are play the vast majority of games (browser games seem okay), and run software. Which is a weird thing to say, that it can't run software. There are plenty of apps in the chrome apps store, but if you have a particular piece of Windows or OSX software that you need to run there may not be the equivalent that has what you need.\n\nThe machine itself seem to be fairly solid. It's not as nice feeling as a MacBook, but it doesn't feel cheap. It has USB ports and an SD card reader, which are nice. An HDMI port and Bluetooth are also give it some flexibility . The screen, while not fantastic, is a good size and a decent resolution for typing on your lap. Viewing angles could be better but are not horrible. The trackpad is large, smooth, and has pretty good sensitivity. I am pretty happy with it. The keyboard is full size or close enough to full size for me not to notice, and I have giant hands. Webcam is decent. The speakers leave a lot to be desired. Tinny, and not very loud. Sound is fine through headphones.\n\nI think the fairest thing to compare this to is to a smart phone or a tablet, because I intend to use it in much the same capacity. If I am home, and sitting on the couch, or involved in some other activity that might involve me glancing at my phone or tablet occasionally, I might use this machine instead. It's a little bigger than a tablet and a lot bigger than a phone, but having a physical keyboard is more conducive to certain activities, like for example writing this review. I am writing this on my Chromebook. Sure, I could write it on my phone or tablet but it would take much longer and be a more frustrating experience on a touch screen keyboard. I am still on the fence as to whether it will actually find a permanent useful place in my computing life.\n\nPros: It boots very fast.\nChrome OS. Pretty much a browser as OS. Not a lot of cruft.\nBattery life is very good. Goes for a couple of days with casual usage.\n\nI've played around with running Linux on it, and it was surprisingly easy. It seems to require being in 'Developer Mode' permanently, which increases boot time, so I stopped using it for now. Easy as pie to install it AND to stop using it. I might play around with it later, but it's nice to now it's an option. (I am curious to try installing Steam for Linux and see if I can stream a game form my Windows desktop...).\n\nCons: If you are not fully committed to the Google way of doing things, this machine will probably be of limited utility to you.\nChrome OS. Pretty much a browser as OS. Not a lot of flexibility. Sometime you want to install a specific piece of software that is not a web app, and while it might technically be possible, there are a lot of hoops to jump through.\nSpeakers aren't great.\n\nFor the Black Friday price, it's totally worth taking a chance on. I am very happy with it so far."}

Anyway, this travels back and forth everyday in a jam packed back pack.  It has survived and we have had no problems at all.  My 13 year old is getting really good at google and with the school using google for everything sending documents etc. It is a fast easy to use computer, we just have to still figure out how to print from google print.  After trying to keep up with my son and seeing how fast it went from page to page, I got myself one, which I love.  Then my younger child started using them at her school so my mom bought her one for her tenth birthday.  She loves it and is able to do all her school websites on it.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "This is my first chromebook, and I have almost no complaints. It is a chromebook, so if you want to store things on the computer you are out of luck. Everything is done on the web, so you need an internet connection. This is the case for all chromebooks, though. The OS is great-- I have fallen in love with Google Chrome. It is much more stable than Windows and the computer is not bogged down with bloatware.  I like Google Docs (no more \"oh no, I just accidentally deleted everything!\" as it keeps a history of all your edits and you can restore).  It does not completely replace a regular laptop due to the lack of off line storage, but it does almost all of what I need a laptop to do. The price is right, the battery lasts a very long time, and the item is small and light with more power than a tablet.\nI DO have the problem others have mentioned with the space bar sticking on the right side. I touch type very quickly, so this can be a pain. I have to make sure I really press hard and sometimes I have to go back and add the space in. It is mildly annoying, but not a deal breaker (its' why this is four and not five stars).\nFor the price, I can't complain. I would buy this again."}

Only little negative is concerning sd, as when inserted it sticks out, if they did it more secluded you could have a fixed extra memory in, but with it sticking out it looks kind of odd and probably not very safe when transported.\n\nComparing it to the macbook air 11\"which I had to get for my oldest daughter I genuinely can't notice too many difference, besides the software which is different obviously and the build quality.

This inexpensive little machine does everything I need it to do, and more.  I fired up the Toshiba last night.  As  a a full size laptop, it's advantage is size, and capacity.  However, the Chromebook is just more efficient to use, less prone to malware, and much easier to carry.  I really like this little machine.  Give it a try.  I think you'll be glad you did."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "I wanted to wait a few weeks after buying this Acer Chromebook 11 before writing a review on it because I knew I'd need time to adjust to the Chrome OS after being a Windows user ever since getting my first desktop computer 15+ years ago.  There definitely ARE fundamental differences between two systems and non-techies like me will need to adjust, but if I can figure them out, anyone can.\n\nLet's go over what a Chromebook is and what they can do.  I've had a number of laptops, netbooks and tablets since that first computer and NONE of them came close to firing up, going online and surfing the web as fast as this one.  It took me time to figure out how to sync it with my wifi router, but once I did, it was \"all systems go-go-go.\"  If you primarily use a computer to surf the internet and send emails, I can't think of a better tool than this one.  These machines are designed to be as idiot-proof (thankfully) as possible and you will never have to run a virus or malware scan again because they can't find a place to land, so to speak., because you're essentially storing everything on a cloud.  That applies to any Chrome or Android product because everything runs through a Google filter, which blocks the bugs.  Another thing worth noting is the battery lasts for hours...I've heard they can go for 10 before needing a recharge, but my experience has been closer to 8.  Still...  It's a very quiet machine with no fan but you never have to worry about it overheating because of its design and simplicity.  Oh, one thing I should mention is that while Chrome and Windows are different, you can still navigate via Internet Explorer and pretty much do everything you've already been able to do online through Windows 8 or 10.  One cool thing about Chrome is the Ad-blocker function that keeps those annoying pop-ups to a minimum.  You can even keep track of how many have been blocked if you wish.\n\nNow, for what Chromebook ISN'T.  One of the reasons it's so fast is that you can't download external software (either via desk or a website) on a Chrome system unless it originates from Google and even then, you're downloading an app and not a program itself.  For instance, I do a lot of audio production for shortwave radio at home but can't download Cool Edit Pro software on my Chromebook.  If I could, I'd ditch one netbook and keep another laptop as backup.  Google is nothing if not proprietary, and the result is that you can't use something like Windows Office on a Chromebook, although there is a Google Docs program available that approximates Word and Excel.  The good news is that there are a ton of free options you can get at the Google Store.  If you're not a fan of storing content like music or text on a cloud (and I'm not), a simple thumb drive or SD card can be useful, especially if you want to access them on another Windows computer.\n\nSorry to go so long, but I thought it important to point out differences between Windows and Chrome.  If you're totally married to using a Windows platform, you may have problems down the road.  If you're tired of having to continually upgrade from Windows 7 to Vista to XP to 8 to 8.1 to 10 and so on, this is worth looking into solely for eliminating that headache.  To my knowledge, Google has never required Chrome users to do anything similar.  I like NOT getting used to navigating through a system, only to be told it's obsolete and that I'll have to pay $$$ for the newer version because the one I like won't be supported anymore (sound familiar, XP fans).\n\nBottom line: This machine is terrific for basic functions and at $159, you can't beat the price.  Even though I was born and raised in Microsoft country, I'm turning the corner and converting to Chrome.  Computers don't have to be complicated and this one isn't."}

Very light weight, battery life is very long. Yes Chromebooks are somewhat limited compared to a full pc but for basic tasks, I find myself pulling out the Acer Chromebook instead of my Sony Ultrabook. It boots in no time and I use it primarily for web surfing, shopping online, toting it into the kitchen to look up a recipe. It weighs virtually nothing & having a physical keyboard versus using a touchscreen tablet is highly preferable to me. It's like the best aspects of a tablet  with a physical keyboard for the price of a low range tablet. The build quality is fine, not too sturdy but not too flimsy, the overall size is perfect, the keyboard size is good although I miss having a \"delete\" key; the touchpad is responsive although I hate touchpads. Speakers are not very strong but that is hardly unusual nor surprising. I got this Acer on the Amazon Black Friday lightning deal as am very pleased with it for ninety nine bucks; at full price my expectations might be higher and the value of this device would take a hit versus some tablets. But a big bonus to me is not having to worry about viruses and malware and the maintenance required to deal with that garbage, an important factor to consider. If I need to work I have PC's for that, for casual use like surfing or writing documents or emails this Acer Chromebook is an excellent choice!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "I've only had the Acer Chromebook 11 for 2-3 days (so I've still got my rose-coloured glasses on) but my overall first impressions are very positive. (Long list of PROs and CONs below)\n\nI currently have a MacBook Air (MBA) Mid-2012 and an iPad Air 2. I use my iPad Air 2 with an external keyboard at work, however, I find the experience a bit compromised and Ive always wanted to try out Chrome OS. And my MBA is used at home by my Wife and I, so it doesn't go to work. It also doesn't have the battery life to achieve what I need.\n\nSo, I used my Acer Chromebook 11 at work today, and was pretty impressed with the performance and use-case (and the outstanding battery life). I use Google Docs at work for meetings, notes, etc. Using the Chromebook today, I found I could achieve my same work a lot faster than with my iPad Air 2 setup. My typing was faster and more accurate, correcting mistakes and moving around a document/spread sheet was a lot fast, and browsing of the web was more enjoyable because you are getting the desktop web. One difference, though, is that my iPad Air 2 gets push notifications for text, email, etc, whereas this doesn't seem to be possible for the Chromebook (not that I was expecting it too). It's also easier to charge my iPad at work, and my white Chromebook certainly stood out!\n\nHere are my current PROS and CONS for the Acer Chromebook 11:\n\nPROS\n the screen is better than I was expecting (it's definitely not in the league of iPads, Samsungs or other IPS panels, but it looks fantastic for a budget PC. I was considering the Lenovo 100S, but the screen on that is terrible compared to the Acer Chromebook)\n the battery is superb!! I am amazed with the battery life on this thing. I can't get over how much I am impressed with the battery life. It easily surpasses my mid-2012 Macbook Air.\n it's pretty fast all around, especially considering the specs. I only notice slow down when I have 6+ tabs open, including having YouTube open. (I think this is more a RAM problem than processor. 4GB in a Chromebook would probably be perfect)\n the keyboard is pretty nice too. I'm still getting used to the Chrome OS specific keys, but overall it feels nice to type on.\n the trackpad works really well and is quite large. Scrolling is as good as any mac I've tried.\n although the body of the laptop doesn't look as good in real life as it does in the product photos, it still feels very solid for such a cheap laptop. There are no creaks in the plastic either.\n internet browsing on the Chromebook is very fast. But for some content-heavy web pages, you have to wait until the webpage has finished loading before you can scroll and move around smoothly. This isn't a problem, just a slight different between iOS/Mac and the Chromebook.\n I'm still getting used to Chrome OS. So far, I like it for my intended use for this laptop - using Google Docs at work, and browsing the web and YouTube at home.\n the WiFi is crazy good in this laptop. It's by far got a stronger antenna than my iPhone 6s Plus and iPad Air 2.\n the speakers are actually pretty good, and loud. Much better than I was expecting. I would probably say that the speakers in the Chromebook sounds louder than my iPad Air 2.\n the output from the 3.5mm audio jack is also very, very loud.\n Google Docs seems to work fine in offline mode, and everything just syncs again when you re-connect to the internet.\n this thing cold boots fast, and wakes from sleep within 1-2 seconds. Very nice.\n\nCONS:\nI only have a couple of cons:\n the keyboard letter keys make nice sounds when you type on them, but my spacebar key is alot 'clickier' than the rest of the keys and makes a noticeably annoying clicky sound. (I know, it's a HUGE deal)\n it's the same with the track pad. I like tapping the track pad (not clicking it), and when you just tap the bottom half of the track pad it makes a sounds because there must be an air gap between the top of the track pad the bottom click mechanism. I don't know if this is specific to my laptop, or on everyone. I am half tempted to open it and see if I can alter it\n the actual click on the trackpad is REALLY loud too.\n I tethered my iPhone to my Chromebook for internet access. I would've liked the Chromebook to hold the connection, even when in sleep mode. It's not a big deal, it just means I need to re-open the settings->hotpost section of my iPhone each time I turned on the Chromebook.\nAnd that's it! Really minor complaints.\n\nAt the end of the day, I can't believe this computer only cost me about $135 AUD (after credits and other promotions). It's an absolute steal.\n\nIf I end up sticking with this laptop long term, I'll probably dream of a couple of key upgrades: 4GB RAM, a nice IPS panel, backlit keys, and charging via MicroUSB or USB-C, not proprietary cords. (but then the Chromebook would probably cost $300-500, not $94.99)\n\nFinal thoughts:\n\nThis device won't be replacing my MacBook Air at all. I routinely tell people that my MacBook Air mid-2012 (my first ever Mac - and still my only Mac) is the best computer I've ever owned. The only thing letting it down these days is battery life. I'm lucky to get 3 hours out of it.\n\nI see the Chromebook as a 'much enhanced' iPad Air 2 experience for school, work and casual browsing. I don't really see it as a proper 'computer' to replace a Mac or a Windows Laptop for all other uses. So I'm not really comparing the Chromebook to the MacBook Air (except for browsing and YouTube, and the huge difference in battery life - which wouldn't be a big deal for newer MacBook Air's).\n\nThe Chromebook also won't replace my iPad Air 2 (which is better for movies and a bit of gaming). For me, the Chromebook slots into a small section of my work life for portable computing on the go that's light and fast, and web browsing and YouTube at home. I will also prefer having the full desktop internet experience, and I significantly prefer a physical keyboard.\n\nLike I said, I still have rose-coloured glasses on. I don't want to build up too much hype, because your MacBook, Windows computer or Desktop are still a lot faster and more capable than this little Chromebook. However, I'm still absolutely amazed with the performance and quality of the device for the cost. $94.99USD is an unbelievable price for what you get! Thank you Acer, Amazon and Google!"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "Just got this as my first Chromebook on a black Friday Deal and the experience has been beyond my expectations. Considering the specs of this tiny and light weight machine, it is surprisingly zippier than my i7 HP Envy laptop with 12 GB RAM when browsing or streaming. It also works seamlessly with Chromecast. Battery life has been good enough that I've not run out of juice after 5 hours of very heavy use (my Surface 3 lasts just 3 hours with similar usage at the same brightness level) and so I expect it to last longer when I am hard pressed to save power.\nMy only issues are the limited storage and the lack of some traditional apps, but there are useful alternatives to meet basic needs. Lack of native productivity apps that work offline like MS Word and Excel is the main problem... I hope google docs had an offline mode. This is a good buy if you want something cheap to browse the internet or stream movies. If your PC is having a hard time casting heavy web pages to Chromecast, this is a good option to consider."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "I'm going to take you through a full day with this machine how I use it, and I'll give you a little bit of insight on the product along the way (especially the hardware).\n\nLet's start with the battery life. If you plug it in overnight, you're golden. Depending on how much you use it, you'll be good to go for a full eight hours of screen on time. However, I use if for little things throughout the day -- for example, it's my lunch period and I need to write a paper for my AP Language class -- and I can get between two and three days, if not four, of battery life without charging again.. This Chromebook charges fast, albeit I still plug it in at night. (FYI, the light can be a little bit bright and bothersome once it turns blue, the color to indicate it's on/charged. If you choose to charge it in the room you sleep in, simply place it face down.)\n\nFast forward a little bit, and I'm at school. Group project? No problem. Depending on if it's turned off or in standby mode, it will take no more than eight to ten seconds to boot up, ask you for your Google account password, and open the web. I personally connect it to my iPhone's personal hotspot, so I have the web EVERYWHERE. I go to drive.google.com, navigate through my labyrinth of folders (most of which are filled with my Google Docs files (free), PDFs of scans from my iPhone's scanner app [Scannable], pictures, etc) and create a new document. My group works on the project, share it with everyone, and go to my next class period. By now, five to ten people are mystified by how light this device is, and how good it works for what I do.\n\nFast forward just a little bit to my TA period, where I'm helping a teacher teach his class. I know far more about technology than he does, but he just got a new phone and would like to transfer pictures. With the right adapter (I just happened to have a micro-SD card adapter and he had a USB cable), you can transfer pictures through the Chromebook to other devices, the Chromebook itself, or anything else you can think of.\n\nFast forward to after school, when I tutor other people for my AP United States History class, and my Chromebook is out on the desk. I have open a PDF of the notes, a PDF of the scan outline, and I'm still using Google to search the web for things that I may not know. I can show people pictures, my notes, etc... all with little to no effort.\n\nThere's no fan. There's no heat, really, even when using graphically intensive tasks. The whiteness of the shell doesn't SCREAM 'weird', but more like a slick \"this is something different\" kind of look.\n\nWhile I'm writing this review, there's a few other things I would like to mention. The keyboard is a DREAM to type on, and I can consistently reach around 70 words per minute. The screen isn't ugly or obtrusive, but it works. You COULD watch Netflix if you really wanted to, but you're probably better off watching on your smartphone or on a television. The touchpad... well, there's an issue with the touchpad.\n\nMaybe my Chromebook is just a little defective (and that certainly could be the case), but it's gotten a little TOO clicky for me. When I gently press down, it doesn't meet my finger, it flexes a bit... actually, more than a bit. It's not horrible, you can still distinguish a click from a little press. However, I turned tap-to-click off because of this little issue. Also, I changed the scrolling style to reflect how a Macbook would perform: natural scrolling. For some reason, Google wanted to be special and call it \"Australian Scrolling.\"\n\nThere's two other big things to address, and these are the obvious, white elephant things about the Chromebook.\n\n1) The obvious absence of a Microsoft Office suite, which I'll address in a minute...\n\n2) The lack of proper printing support.\n\nGoogle has remained mostly inactive when it comes to coming up with printing solutions for the Chromebook. They seem to want to FORCE YOU to use their solution, Google Cloud Print. But, there's other plugins on the Chrome Web Store. For example, there's a plugin on the store by HP, Epson, and I believe a few others. The HP one is certainly buggy in all respects, sometimes flat-out refusing to print. The solution I use is to use the Chromebook way for everything else: put it all in the cloud. If everything is in the cloud, you can do more than access it from any device, you can print from any device; I use my iPhone to print in the Google Drive app and the individual apps for Docs, Sheets, and Slides.\n\nMicrosoft Office is a big absence from the Chromebook ecosystem. Breathe. You're going to be just fine.\n\nThis is a device you throw in a backpack, not a desktop publishing suite (yet). Yes, there's a Microsoft Office web app, but what can you do with it that is any better than Google Drive? Take the jump, and you might feel especially comforted by the fact that the Chromebook comes with 100 GB of free, Google Drive storage, and documents created in Docs, Slides, and Sheets don't even count towards your storage. Also, you may not have noticed, but almost everywhere on the web where you can upload files, you'll see a \"Choose from Google Drive\" button right under it that works better than uploading. This is especially true if you use Turnitin.com like I have to.\n\nThat's it! That's everything you might want to know if you're a student wanting this device. If you have any specific questions, feel free to comment. I'd be more than happy to help you."}

This Acer Chromebook is quite a deal for less than $200, with an 11.6 inch screen, 2 GB of DDR3L SDRAM memory, 16 GB of internal storage, and a Intel Celeron N2830 Dual Core Processor. The screen is very bright, with crisp graphics perfect for streaming media, web browsing and editing documents. The whole netbook comes in at about 2 lbs. so its quite light. The netbook is clad in plastic, but the fitment feels tight and durable. I was able to get about 9 hours of life out of the battery before it needed charging, which is more than adequate.

There must be some bugs that Acer or Chromebook needs to figure out.\n\nGot this before Black Friday sales and received it today.  I had an Acer PC in the past and it was good so I thought to give it a try since its discounted.  I am used to windows office system in the past, this Chromebook is very similar in terms of the applications.  It is easy to figure out what is what and how to set it up.  The speed on internet is fast as well and everything is loaded in the cloud so it does not store in the hardware and slow down the computer -- at least not yet.  The Chromebook will also save a lot of my money because I finally no longer need to spend money to purchase windows office and the other applications like powerpoints, word, excel.  Everything is aviliable in the Chrome and I can covert it to be office compatible.  My kids also told me that in their school they use Chromebook?  Which was a surprise to me, I thought it would be Windows or Mac.  I guess its because the Chrome app are free and this save school a lot of money as well.  So I guess Chrome would be a trend as well.\n\nThis PC is very light because every parts are like plastic, I don't know how its going to be like on a drop test so need to be extra careful.

If you're visiting sites in individual tabs with a large amount of media you'll find yourself quickly running out of RAM.  I don't necessarily fault ChromeOS for this, I knew that 2 GB was still going to be on the low end.  If you're wanting to run Crouton as I do, fork out a little more and get a model with 4 GBs of RAM.\n\nDon't regret this purchase one bit, I have no desire to use my Windows PC anymore, and not just because MS owes me a free key for one of their updates corrupting the MBR on one of my SSDs.

If you are big into windows os and rely on password protected media (password protected thumb drives/external hard drives) then this will not fit you very good as those require .exe files. However if you just use media without password protection it works great.\n\nThe interface is very simple and goes hand in hand with google drive. Very little hard drive space but that is perfect for me because all you need is google drive. Plus, i like how easy it would be to reset it if need be. For instance, if it ever starts to lag in the future, i won't have anything stored on the device so i can just easily reset it to factory settings without losing anything due to using google drive as my storage drive.\n\nThere is a bigger acer chromebook at around 15\" or so but i wanted this one because it is more compact. The screen looks great and ive had no issues with the touchpad. Its super light and doesnt seem to get hot. Ive even used it with the second screen function with my mac desktop and it mirrored my mac just fine. That feature comes in handy if i want to access my mac from a different room and be portable. The speakers also sound great.\n\nOverall, this is a great machine and the price is unbeatable. Plenty of apps to complete any task. Also you can google for sites online that are helpful too. For example,  i found a few really helpful websites that edit pictures with many different effects and features. Better than downloading an app in my opinion. Im very glad to have this and use it often. I own an ipad, 4 other laptops one being a macbook, 4 desktops ( one windows and three mac) and i grab this one to use probably more than any of them.

I was hesitant to order a laptop a small screen because I was used to a 15\" screen on my old computer but this size is just fine for my needs.  I have not missed the larger screen and actually like the fact that this is easier to move around and hold on my lap without the worry that it would slide off.  I was also worried that the \"flat keyboard\" (which all laptops seem to have now) would be difficult since i was used to a sculptured style keyboard but this has not been a problem.  The keys are large enough so you don't accidentally hit the wrong key and the \"home key\" is well marked if you are a \"touch typist\" like i am.  The speakers are fine and loud enough to hear but I have added speakers since I already had a nice pair.  I had used GOOGLE CHROME on my last computer even though it had windows and am now delighted to be rid of all of WINDOWS!  Although I had used Chrome before, I do think it would have been nice to have more instructions with this product, some people might be a little lost at first if they are not familiar with it...but it is easy.

It was excruciatingly slow. I only need a computer for two things. Doing school work and watching porn so I figured this would be enough. I was wrong. I would just have firefox open and it would start freezing up just from normal web browsing.  It would restart itself a few times. It couldn't handle any of the tasks I did except for word processing without locking up momentarily.\n\nI figured it would be slow but that I could just upgrade the memory but turns out this computer is not upgradable so I promptly returned the SOB."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "I bought this chromebook a year ago, and I have been very pleased.  I was hesitant to leave the comfort of Windows, but I was finished with having laptops freeze up on me or have internal hard drives fail, and I was ready for something that was fast and reliable, and able to handle my very basic needs.\n\nI can navigate several tabs at the same time. I have tested it's capacity by streaming Watch ESPN, Youtube and Pandora. There was some lag with all 3 running, but that was expected. I was shocked that I could do all 3 on this machine, as I could hardly do one on my previous PC. I cant think of a valid reason I would have 3 streaming services like that running at once, and this machine handles one at a time with no impact to other tasks (email, browsing, Docs, Sheets...)\n\nThe biggest hurdles for me:\n- My printer is not cloud enabled, so I had to keep my windows computer running and connected both to the internet and the printer. Sometimes this was a hassle, making sure everything was on and connected just to print a sheet. This was a known obstacle, but I just wanted to include it for anyone who may not have thought about it prior to purchasing.\n- Google Sheets is okay for very, very basic spreadsheets. However, I've found it difficult to do pivot tables (it is possible, but it's just a very different format).  The loss of Microsoft Office was the hardest part of the transition. Google Docs is fantastic, and I haven't found any functionality that I need that is not readily and clearly available. Slides and Sheets are clearly lower versions than what MS offers on dedicated software, but they are free and functional. Again, this was a known obstacle.\n\nI've thoroughly enjoyed this chromebbok. It's ultra portable. It's responsive. It's effective at doing everything that I need out of a laptop. I don't do video or photograph editing, gaming, or anything else that requires a high performing PC.  But for my needs, I couldn't have asked for more."}

It only \"died\" because it got dropped dozens of times and eventually the screen went bad.\n\nI've only had this one for a week or so, and my V key is already super-sticky (and I haven't spilled anything on the keyboard.)

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "Research Chromebooks pretty extensively. Wanted something more than a tablet, less than a laptop.... and virus-resistant. Researched brands, and settled on the Acer Chromebook 11. Review were excellent. Everybody seems to like it, so I purchased it. Even paid way too much for 1-day shipping so I could take it with us for the weekend. Get it right away this morning. Out of the box. Plug it in... and..... (wait for it)....... \"Google OS is damaged or missing. Install USB Recovery\". What ?? It did give a website to go to for assistance, so I get on the desktop, go there, and start the \"Chromebook Recovery\" process. Oh, and before you try this.... you need at least 4GB thumb drive or SD card. the only thumb drive I could find laying around was 2GB.... so I stole one from my camera. Follow all the directions.... download, verify, write. Pretty clunky. Had to do it  three times to get a good download and get it to write to the media. It finally did, so after four hours of screwing with it, it finally booted. Will start using it and update this review later. So far, not incredibly impressed.\n\n==========================================\n12/8/15 Update: Just returned from a trip where I took the Chromebook. The machine was small, light and hassle free to carry in a backpack. As it did not come with a case I had to find something to put it in. I should have bought a case when I ordered this as  Amazon has some inexpensive ones that are made to fit. So, I'd first recommend that you buy a case when you buy the Chromebook, as it does not come with one. All I could find locally was a rectangular zip-up gun bag for a Glock, but it fit nearly perfectly. Probably paid too much for it too. The machine performed well on the trip... providing you could get a good wireless connection. In airports this seemed highly variable. I did note that anything less than 4-bars signal strength that webpages did not load well at all. Said I was connected but webpages would time out and never load. 4-bars or better seemed OK. Hotels were also variable, and of course some hotels charges for your wireless connection. The long and short: If you can get a decent wireless connection, the machine seems to perform well as a net device. Standalone with no internet ? Pretty limited. Can't see to do too much of anything as you really don't have any local applications installed to be able to work offline. There are a lot of apps available for free, but most of them seem to be links to websites. Very few apps actually run locally on the machine, so with no connection I can't seem to do very much. But.... I guess it does what it is designed to do. A \"netbook\", not really a laptop. As long as you keep this in mind it seems to do quite well."}

The epic battery life, surprisingly not-terrible chiclet keyboard, light weight, smooth and accurate trackpad, and decently loud speakers make this a wonderful device for someone who works online like I do. using a combination of chrome extensions, webapps, and online services, it's actually a pretty powerful work device, with the portability and speed of smartphones and tablets, I even took this thing on a vacation and built my personal website using it. I love being able to simply charge it at night, and then not worry about the battery at all during the day. I even recommended this to my grandmother when her HP AIO's hard drive died, since Chrome OS has a \"dock\" feature that makes it very easy to turn it into a desktop, and she has loved it as well!\n\nA lot of people don't really like Chrome OS, but that's simply because they don't have a use for it, their work requires more heavy power-user type software that the Chromebook can't run, (if I were still working in video editing I would probably be the same way, but that's what I have my desktop for, this is really best as a portable companion device.) but for the people who DO have a use for it, it's awesome, and I'm actually looking into purchasing another more fully-featured touchscreen Chromebook because this one has served me so well."}

I am getting used to the new operating system. It starts up and shuts down fast. Goes to where I want it to go, faster.  I primarily got it so I can watch Netflix. I have attached a wireless mouse which is nice. I am a senior citizen so the new technology takes a little longer to get used to than it did a few years ago. I had no help setting it up. I am still searching around for useful apps. I am enjoying its small size and being so light. For the price, it is very good. I am sure I will feel the same once I have it completely as I was. A fun little item."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "I got this machine a placeholder until next year, when I start a better paying job. I assumed I'd have to change it for a more versatile laptop, but the truth is this suits my purposes just fine. Basically, I need an internet browser and access to Google docs. I don't play games, write any programs, or work with any visual media.\n\nThis laptop has helped me realized what I need from a computer: google docs, google chrome, netflix, and a search engine. There's really no need for me to spend a great deal of money for anything more. I'm probably not going to upgrade until this laptop falls apart. It has superb battery life, it's silent, and it has so few background stuff running that it doesn't overheat even on the odd Sunday that I might be wasting on netflix.\n\nIf you're the type who plays games online, makes videos or visual art, or generally need the power to run lots of esoteric programs, then this chromebook is probably not for you. If, like me, you just need an internet machine, then this is worth every affordable penny. The only thing I kinda of miss is a touchscreen, but not enough that I'm eager to pay for something else anytime soon."}

I think this is an issue with the school itself because I was able to access my online course content through my local college no problem.

The thing feels like a $150 computer, and hey that's fine. For me the main problem is the switch to Chromebook. I've run in to too many occasions in the past month where I've signed up for a service and been told Chromebook is not supported. It's frustrating. This computer is good as a stopgap if you can't afford a real computer, and I think will be good as my daughter's first computer when she's old enough, but for me right now, I'd have to put this in the \"rinky-dink computer\" category."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "I'd not ever tried Chromebooks before.  I usually work on mac and windows.  I decided to try this out and the price seemed too good to be true.  Of course the other reviews are mostly incredible so it made sense to give it a go.  I have to say I'm converted.  The laptop is light, easy to use and chrome is really worth checking out and taking a little time to get used to.  I had also considered the 15 inch version and tried it, but surprisingly preferred this smaller screen.  The 15 is beautiful and basically a bigger version of this with a great screen, but there's something impressive about this little machine that needs to be experienced to be appreciated.\n\nThe typing is incredible, the keyboard has no 'bounce' and the screen - while its not hd - is really clear and bright.  The sound is surprisingly great too and perfect for me to listen to youtube / music.\n\nBattery was something I really hoped was as good as stated and mine is.  I get more time on this than any other device I've used like this.\n\nThe fast on/off is really cool.  I had heard Chromebooks were like this but coming to chrome OS for the first time was really cool to experience.\n\nOf course you're not going to be doing Photoshop or photo editing on this but for a perfect on the go computer this takes some beating.  I use OneDrive and you can pin that to the shelf (cool idea) like all other websites/apps and I find it really easy to use.  Google drive I assume does the same thing... haven't tried it yet.  All in all I'm enjoying experiencing Chrome OS for the first time.\n\nIn conclusion I'd recommend this to anyone of my friends as a truly great computer and one of the few I've tried this last year that really give value for money.  If you're on the fence I'd say definitely give it a go.  If you understand its not a machine for doing Pshop, picture or video editing, but want a fast, light and highly useful laptop for using on the go and want to begin learning Chrome OS its perfect."}

I would recommend this for students who need a device to do basic research, or stay at home moms like myself who just want something to poke around on the internet.  I'm going to be taking this on an international trip to edit my photos with as well.  It has an SD card slot, and I'll be using the free Pixlr Editor.  After having a tablet for a while, I'm very happy to be back on a machine with a real keyboard for typing."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "I'm typing this review on this Chromebook right now! I'm a graduate student, and I got tired of my Windows computer installing updates every time I opened my laptop. It was frustrating. I just wanted to open my laptop and get right to writing my homework. Now I can! It's also very lightweight, so I can easily bring it and all my books with me to class. It holds a charge for at least 2-3 days of active homework use and general internet fun for me. It starts up almost instantly when I open it! The screen size is fine, and I often have two windows open at the same time, side by side. I've been trying to read more articles online without printing them, and using online textbooks via my Kindle app. After a bit of a learning curve, this has worked out awesome, because if I have my Chromebook, I have ALL my textbooks with me, plus my course information, and my notebook to write things down. I love it. Plus, it doesn't get hot or make a whirring sound when you use it for a long time. I like that because I often use mine while I\"m sitting on the couch.\n\nGetting used to using the Chromebook had some hiccups. First, I recommend using Google Docs for writing because it has an offline mode. The Windows OneDrive and cloud version of Word works ok, but if your internet has any interruption, you can't keep typing. That's annoying. So use Google Docs, and don't worry about it! (But if you're working on a project with someone, and they use Word on a Windows laptop, you can collaborate with them no problem using the cloud version of Word.) Second, organizing my files confused me, until I realized that \"Save As\" is now \"Move to folder.' Also, you can download a few files to your Chromebook, so if you need to upload an attachment to Blackboard, you can pretty easily. You'll use your Google Drive for much of your file storage. I did connect my OneDrive to my Chromebook, but it's through a third party app thing, and the connection always has to be redone, so I don't really rely on that, and I plan to move my OneDrive stuff to my Google drive soon.\n\nThe only thing that was really hard was setting up my Chromebook to print to my WiFi printer. Google cloud print is in beta, and in theory, it's awesome. When you're done setting it up, you could print to your home printer from anywhere, using your mobile device. However, Google your printer and how to set up cloud print, and give yourself some time to set it up. If you're in a rush, you should just plug your printer into your Chromebook.\n\nLastly, since many public schools are going Chromebook, I thought it was a good idea to get one myself. I'm working on getting my Master of Arts in Teaching to be an elementary/middle school teacher. Using one for my own schoolwork helps me be able to help students use their Chromebooks. Additionally, the price is so nice, I don't worry about having to ever replace my Chromebook, because if it was damaged by schoolchildren, I'd only be out about $160 (instead of $2000 for a Mac). I'm even thinking of getting one for my mom, since most of what she does online could be done on a Chromebook, too.\n\nOh, and one very last thing, the keyboard is really enjoyable to type on. The keys are spaced comfortably, and the individual keys make a nice clicky sound, are springy, and are nice and thin, for fast typing. I know that might sound weird, but I'm picky about my keyboards."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "I'm a college student and ordered this when my laptop crashed. I had been thinking about getting a chromebook anyway because my laptop is really heavy, bulky, and difficult to take to class if I want to take notes. I ended up just choosing this one because of the great amazon reviews, low price, and prime shipping (which isn't the criteria I'd normally use, but I wanted to get it as soon as possible). I did end up fixing my other laptop before this came in the mail, but decided to keep it anyway.\n\nSo first off, this laptop is very cute but 11.6 inches is pretty small, which is fine for my purposes but I sorta wish I would've gone with a slightly bigger screen. Otherwise, it works very well, pretty fast, it's well-built, has a nice keyboard and trackpad, and it's very small and light which is perfect for throwing into my backpack and transporting to class, or even if I want to go home for the weekend. The battery life is excellent--it lasted me all day on my heaviest day of classes, and then a couple of episodes of bones on netflix after. (That's around 11 hours of classes in a row, where it was on and I was taking notes on it a good portion of that time). Chrome OS has some limitations because I sometimes need to upload stuff as a word doc. and there's some stuff I have to do on excel that just doesn't work on google sheets.

You pay to buy a new printer that will work with this computer or pay to pick up a printed doc at FedEx.  Also, after using your allotted cloud storage, they will charge you for extra space.

I tend to be EXTREMELY careful with my electronic devices, but this thing got a bruise on the screen within two months. I even had a case for it, and always put it between the books in my backpack for school. That being said, Acer actually replaced my father's machine, even though they suspected someone damaged it (which probably did happen).\n\nIf you are going to buy one of these, DEFINITELY get a drops and spills policy on it."}

It's sturdy and attractive for the price. However, it is noticeably slower with a much shorter battery life than the Chromebook I had before this one which is this ASUS option -  http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00VUV0MG0?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00 - The ASUS option has gone up in price since I bought it but there seem to be other ASUS options with similar specs. The ASUS Chromebooks are physically a little flimsier, but I would recommend an accident protection plan for any Chromebook. My old ASUS (before I broke the screen hinge) was perfect for me. Consistently fast and a crazy long battery life. It was worth the extra money for me.\n\nThis Acer Chromebook is still a good choice for someone who doesn't mind the shorter battery life, prefers a sturdier build, won't have more than a few browser tabs open at a time and wants to save that bit of extra money."}

As Chromebooks go this is definitely not a high end machine by any means but probably the best in this price range. The keyboard, matte display, etc. are all what I would classify as serviceable and perfectly acceptable for a notebook that costs this little.

When I called Acer, the guy didn't understand English; I told him the seam of the monitor was splitting, and he thought I was saying the display had a problem. Then he said I could not get a replacement computer (even though I bought it a few weeks ago), and I'd have to send it in for repairs. Then they would decide if I'd have to pay for the repair. Pay for a repair of a new computer? Then I called Amazon, and they're going to send me a replacement computer. So Amazon's customer service is good, and Acer's is not. Thanks Amazon, avoid Acer."}

It is annoying when you are trying to write a note while the powerpoint slides are up and don't get to write at the same time.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "Why are there so few reviews for computers for senior citizens?  I spent weeks researching the perfect laptop for my 80 year old grandmother.  She had been using a desktop computer from 2005.  Needless to say, the desktop computer was already past its life expectancy.  I researched the differences between Chromebooks and regular PCs.  The reviews on this product are numerous and extremely helpful.  After thoroughly researching options and reading the reviews for this product, I purchased it for my grandmother.  It was delivered via Amazon Prime in 2 days as promised.  I added the optional protection coverage because it was inexpensive and well... my grandmother is 80.  It's hard to tell what kind of abuse this Chromebook may endure over the next 2 years.  As soon as it was delivered, I walked it over to her house.  I sat down with her and we opened it together.  Upon taking it out of the box I was stunned at how lightweight it is.  Yes, the shell is plastic- however it still seems sturdy enough.  There is a quick start sheet inside the box that shows how to quickly set it up.  Basically, plug in the Chromebook and then turn the power on.  First step was to connect to my grannie's WiFi.  No problem there.  Then I set up a free Google account for her.  Again, no problem.  There is an easy tutorial that comes up to show you what you can do on your new Chromebook.  I walked her through only the parts that she would use.  I showed her how the touch pad works- how to turn the machine on and off- how to access Chrome to search the internet- and then I added the Facebook app for her.  Less than 1/2 hr later I walked out the door so she could play with her new toy.  So let's walk through the pros and cons of this Acer Chromebook when used by Senior Citizens.\nPros:\n-Setup is simple.  If the senior is new to the laptop concept, there will be slight learning curve to using the touchpad vs using a mouse.  I told my grannie to try out the touchpad for 1 week to see if she could get used to it.  I told her if she couldn't get used to it then I would buy her a mouse.  Yes, you can connect a mouse to this Chromebook.  (Within 1/2 hour she said she loves the touchpad and has no need for a mouse.)\n-No need to worry about updates.  No need to worry about anti-virus software.  No annoying pop-ups regarding programs that are running in the background.  No need to call your granddaughter at work because you got some strange pop up that states your computer can't do an update because the blah blah blah definitions are out of date.\n-Straightforward, easy to use\n-Lightweight for arthritic hands to carry around\n-Exceptional battery life\n-Matte screen (anti-glare)\n-Screen has adjustable brightness\n-Keys are black with white lettering, nice key feel with a slight clicking sound as you type\n-Automatically connects to internet when you turn it on, remembers your settings\n-If you don't power down, but instead just fold the screen down- it will go into sleep mode and keep up your user profile so you don't have to type in your credentials each time you open the screen up (unless you change this in the settings).\n-Amazon offers a protection plan through a 3rd party.  This protection plan was inexpensive and covers the laptop against damage from accidental drops or spills for 2 years.  This gives peace of mind to the senior using the laptop.\n-Depending on where your wireless router is inside your house/building, I found the range with this laptop to be quite impressive.  My grandmother can sit outside on her screened in porch to browse the internet- something she is extremely excited about!\n-Fast!  Of course, this depends on your internet connection speed.  So, let's just say the processor is fast and since no programs are running in the background my grandmother can pull up her favorite websites quickly.\n-Finally, I cannot neglect to acknowledge the low price tag on this machine.  It makes me seriously wonder why I felt the need to spend so much money on my MacBook Air for myself.  I was wowed by how much my MacBook Air can do, but in reality, I only use about 10% of the features it affords. With the Apple iCloud, all my documents and pics are stored in a cloud- a Chromebook does the same thing. Since I mainly surf the internet, manage my photos, and occasionally edit a Word or Excel document, this Acer Chromebook would have fit my needs as well.  And at about 10% of the cost!\nCONS:\n-The small screen size may be difficult for seniors who experience difficulty reading small print.  A larger screen size may be more ideal for many seniors (My grannie miraculously has perfect eyesight, so this was not an issue for her).\n- Some seniors have difficulty seeing white print on black keys.  You may need to consider a keyboard with black print on white keys and a larger keypad in general\n-Many seniors use laptops for more than just web browsing.  A Chromebook may pose limitations on what they can do.  Some people don't trust a cloud for storing documents and pictures.\n\nOverall:  My grandmother needed a simple and very easy to use laptop for web browsing, shopping online and checking Facebook.  This Acer Chromebook was an ideal choice for her.  Set-up was extremely easy.  Grannie likes the small size, likes that she doesn't have pop-ups all over the place and likes that it is lightweight enough to carry around the house.  If the senior in your life has limited vision, I'd still go for an Acer Chromebook-- just maybe get the 13.3\" or 15.6\".  On Amazon all 3 options are offered at an incredible price!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "I bought this after much investigation of exactly what it was actually. After figuring out it is Chrome browser in a box I decided to take a chance. I'm glad I did, especially after finding out that I could install ubuntu linux on it, this is huge. The fact is that although Chrome has it's limits, because after all it's just a browser, the fact that you can install a full blown Linux operating system on it removes those limitations. Now due to the limitations of the small 16g drive space you of course can't install all the Linux programs one would have on a full blown computer, but you can install the programs you use the most. I can ssh into my main computer or into my media server and setup the programs or movies I want to stream to the roku and play using plex. Yes sir, if you are  linux geek this is the laptop to get, especially for sittin' on the couch stuff. lol. I am a Slackware guy but Ubuntu is easy enough to learn for any Linux lover and you can install it easily using Crouton Ubuntu installer. Crouton was created by a Chrome OS employee and works like a charm. You can swap between Chrome OS and Ubuntu Linux with the following key strokes: ctl/shift/alt/right arrow and c/s/a/left arrow, the arrows in the top row not on the keypad. The documentation says \" with an intel processor you swap with c/a/arrow\" but on this one that is not true, it is c/s/a/arrow.  For a 150 buck Linux laptop, you can't go wrong. Get it. BTW, I bought this from best buy because they had it on sale 10 bucks cheaper."}

Not only is it low cost, almost as fast it has a really resolute display. I was thinking of returning it because I have since learnt that it's easy to reload the Chrome OS on my older chromebook. BTW, all chrome users should make a recovery flash drive to resurrect their OS if it crashes. I was running a dozen sites simultaneously and perhaps overloaded the system.

It does a terrible job with media files, including certain image files (how much more basic does it get!?). I have a thumb drive full of movies I can't watch  on this thing and have had to learn more about \"codecs\" than I ever wanted (still couldn't fix it though). I've spent a TON of time trying to learn the elaborate work-arounds for this piece of junk but usually they do not work.\n\nIn addition, there are very few apps and extensions out there for it, and easily more than half of the ones I've tried either don't work at all or don't fix the problems I'm trying to deal with.\n\nI've also encountered errors in drive where I'll make a document available for off-line use and it again, not working.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "I bought this chromebook for school, and I'm completely happy with it. I had originally purchased an HP Stream 11, because I thought I would give the Windows OS another try, but that turned into a complete and total fail. I upgraded to Windows 10, which uninstalled all of my drivers (and apparently got rid of the ability to reinstall them), as well as deleted the recovery partition that I created, rendering the computer completely useless. So I returned the HP Stream, and started seeking out other budget-computer opportunities. I came across the Acer Chromebook 11 on the Google store, and decided to try it. Personally I love it, and I think that it's completely capable of handling anything that a student needs in a computer. Google Docs now works offline, so you can edit documents without a wifi connection, and you also have the ability to use the entire online version of MS Office for free. The setup was simple to. Select your language, timezone, and sign in with your google account, and you'll be up and running right away. I would recommend this to anyone who is just looking for a computer for school, or really anything. Keep in mind that you can't download PC software, being that everything runs in the chrome browser. But you can get some offline apps, and there's even a few new tools that allow you to run some android apps on the chromebook. Very pleased with my Chromebook :)"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "Trying to find a cheap, decent laptop can sometimes feel like searching for a live unicorn, impossible.  I've been a Mac user for years, and  unfortunately my MacBook started running painfully slow this past spring.  As a college student I needed a computer to get my work done but couldn't afford a new Mac on my student budget.  I'm not a huge fan of Windows OS so a friend of mine suggested I look into Chromebooks.  I must have read nearly every online tech journal suggestion and amazon review for different Chromebooks and after a couple months of research I determined that this Acer Chromebook was going to be the best for my budget, and, so far I am very impressed.\n\n  I will say that I think this Chromebook is better quality than you would assume from the price, however, if your used to high resolution screen quality you may be disappointed (for all of you high resolution snobs out there).\n\n  Things I like about the laptop:\n  -  It's compact although not so small its difficult to use.\n  -  It has an SD card reader, which may not be a huge deal to most people, but I've never had one in my laptop so I love it!\n  -  It's easy to hook up to my TV using an HDMI cable so I can watch shows or share pictures with friends\n  -  It's easy to clean if I get smudges etc. on it\n  -  The Chrome OS is easy to use and clean, although I must say it does take some getting used to if you're used to other operating systems\n  -  The charging cord isn't big and clunky.  It's easy to pack away and not a complete eyesore\n\nLike I said above, overall I really like this laptop.  As a college student it does everything I need it to do.  I'm able to write emails easily, access videos, write papers using Google Docs and save \"sticky notes\" to my desktop.  I was also able to import my iTunes library from my MacBook which is great.  If you're looking for a laptop that can handle heavy computing, gaming or media editing (photos, videos, etc.) this probably won't be the best choice for you, but if you want something to surf the internet, listen to music, or create documents then it is more than sufficient and an excellent choice.  Really for the price it can't be beat and I would definitely recommend it to anyone searching from a Chromebook.\n\nIn the end I do need to note a bit of a nuisance I experienced when initially setting up the chromebook.  After entering all of my wireless network information I couldn't get it to connect to wifi, no matter how hard I tried.  Finally I had a friend with a hotspot help me. We reset the Chromebook to factory settings then tried again, and the second time I had no problem.  Not sure if the issue stemmed from the machine itself or my network the first time around.  It was annoying, but in the end didn't effect my overall impression of this Acer Chromebook."}

Extremely disappointed. I could understand if the computer had been dropped or fallen or knocked... anything! But this normal type of inadvertent touch should not destroy a computer screen.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "I purchased this li'l guy to bring along on a motorcycle tour to handle my photo and video files while on the road. I needed a way to transfer files from my cameras to an external hard drive, my requirements were simple: an SD card reader and at least one USB 3.0 drive. This model met all of the criteria, had good reviews and was lightweight enough to fly across the world with me (and for $150 bucks it wasn't a huge investment), so I pulled the trigger and bought it.\n\nAfter using it for a few weeks here are my impressions:\n\nPROS:\n\n-This little compy starts up quickly and functions surprisingly well for almost any web-based work you might need.\n- It's very easy to dual boot with Ubunutu (don't do this unless you know what you're getting into)\n- Just enough ports to handle almost basic file management for photography and video.\n- $150\n\nCONS:\n\nThe only big problem I have with compy is a pretty big one: the color calibration on the built-in screen is pretty terrible. The computer has a very strong bluish tone to it and very shallow color contrast, as a result, nothing on this monitor is even close to the color's you'd find on a more accurate display. Unfortunately this is a feature shared by almost all 11\" Chromebooks. This was almost a deal breaker for me, my entire decision to purchase this computer was as a way to manage and edit photographs while on the road, without an accurate screen I am playing guess work with the color balance, tint, and saturation of every photo I'd edit on this platform. I've managed to work around this by using my phone's screen to check colors, but it's a messy workaround. Even using the color calibration tools in Ubuntu didn't manage to fix the problem. For my photo work, I now only it to transfer files.\n\nOVERALL:\n\nDespite the poor color calibration, I use this computer for 95% of my humdrum computer needs. As a result my MacBook Pro sits on my desk more and more. The chromebook boots up faster and functions more smoothly while browsing, just don't expect to use it for any design/photography needs."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "This laptop is fun to use.  Very lightweight and VERY FAST!  I'm so tired of waiting for my Windows based laptops to load pages.  True, they are at least 3 years old and probably need a good cleaning out, but this laptop's speed makes me love it.  Also, it will probably stay that way as so much of the Chrome based data is stored in the cloud.  It's also pleasant to use - good-feeling silent keyboard and truly comfortable on your lap as it weighs so little.  Keyboard is a bit different than a Windows based one so it takes a bit of getting used to, but the feel of the keys and the layout of the keyboard are fine.  Also, some of the keys in the top row are very useful including easy ways to adjust screen brightness, volume and text size.  Many YouTube videos explain how Chromebook works compared to Windows based computers.  I use it for internet browsing, investing including Marketsmith (great charting service), email, music (Rhapsody), Kindle Chromebook app, Netflix, YouTube, etc.  Speakers not bad but I use a small exterior speaker and it connects by bluetooth.  I'm not a gamer.  So far I haven't been able to get it to connect to my old printer so I may need to get\na newer printer, but I use my older Windows based laptop for this.  Very good value and I can see why it is a top seller on Amazon - which was one big reason I bought it."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "I love my Acer Chromebook!  This is my second Acer computer.  I purchased Acer's because our IT person at school said they are the brand he has to work on the least.  I bought the Chromebook to use in my classroom to help me go paperless.  I read all the reviews, and the price is what finally sold me.  I have not yet been disappointed.  It is super fast and connects beautifully to all the wifi locations I have tried.  Also, it has a great battery life.  As long as I shut down the computer when I finish, I can usually get five or more hours out of a battery charge.  Having said that, there are some limitations you might want to take into consideration before purchasing:\n1.  This computer has a Chrome operating system.  As such, you will probably not be able to download quite a few of the programs you are used to using.  My gradebook web site does not support Chrome, so I have to do all of my grades on my regular PC or my iPad.  It is clearly designed to run Chrome only programs.\n2.  You must have wifi to use this computer.  Without a wifi connection, it is basically a doorstop.  Since I bought it to use with my Google apps, that is perfectly fine for me.  However, because of the limited operating system and limited storage, you cannot do very much offline with it.\n3.  Google apps run perfectly!  As a teacher, I use Google mail, Google Classroom, and many other Google apps.  They run beautifully on this computer.\n4.  When I first started using the computer, it would shut down frequently and restart.  I was a little nervous.  However, it seems to worked through any bugs or glitches it was having because it has worked flawlessly ever since.  It may have taken a while to get used to my programs or to fully update all the apps.\nI think many of the negative reviews were based on incorrect expectations for the device. I bought the Chromebook as a lightweight alternative to my regular laptop and as a more versatile alternative to my iPad (the Google Drive and Google Classroom apps are just a step above useless on the iPad).  In this regard, the Chromebook has exceeded my expectations.  If you are expecting a fully  functioning counterpart to a computer or MacBook, then you will probably be disappointed.  But, it you are wanting a lightweight computer to access on-line documents, check email, and check/update social media, then this is a great computer!  I recommend it highly, but be sure you purchase it with all the limitations in mind."}

I have large hands and a tablet just doesn't cut it for me.  I have an iPad from my employer, and I do use it, but I like this better.  I bought this on my own dime, as there is a child in our house and his school is using these.  So, I thought I would buy the cheapest one i could find just to see how it works.  It works great.  It is much lighter than an iPad, the screen is brilliant, and it has a full keyboard.  I took it on a vacation and it is so light and so thin, it was great.  Connects easily to WiFi, runs Chrome o/s and I can even connect it to my employers VDI environment.  I will admit, I tired this model because I wanted to kick the tires on the most economical unit I could find.  But now that I have it, I cannot think of anything else I would want on it.  You may want to do a little reading on Chromebooks, if you have never owned one.  It does not have a Windows or Linux o/s, so you cannot connect a printer directly to it.  A mouse works fine, just plug and play.  Battery life is unbelievable - like 9 hours.  The speakers are better than a Dell laptop I own.  It starts and you can login in like 5 seconds.

It is wonderful..\nIt is fast, very fast in fact.\nIt is very similar to an apple\nit is nice and compact and easy to carry.\nand the battery last for a long duration before needing a charge.  Then when it does need one,  it will re-charge quite fast.\n\nSo overall it is well worth the money,\nthe only cons i can see at this time.  Are that i don't know how good this computer will last against time.  For i just got it a week ago.  But so far no complaints.  But once again I've only had it for a week."}

I use this pretty much for being online, which I was able to complete 32 online college classes with this. Just a tip: use microsoft word online- it's better than google docs. It also wouldn't download skype, but I think there will be a web version (with video) sometime in the future. It's a heck of a lot faster and has less errors and hiccups than my macbook believe it or not."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "This is a very good computer, and I am surprised it cost me less than $200. It arrived on time, it's smaller than, say, a mac book, but you don't notice the difference at all. The screen quality is great, the keyboard works fine. It has crazy good speakers for such a small machine. It was a little tricky figuring out how to save pictures and access them, and the settings are a little confusing, but I got the hang of it pretty quickly. This computer was designed for you to mostly use Drive; save pics on drive, etc. It's a very light machine, which is nice since l have to lug books around school all day. It's a great computer if you just want something to browse around the internet. Really the only cons are that you cannot save any pictures to the desktop."}

As long as you're not getting this to play large games (it plays some small apps pretty good) or to run large programs, then this laptop should work out just fine! i basically only use it to search the web, type documents for school (use google drive a lot), and youtube (runs youtube VERY well). Great laptop!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "I must say those looking at Chromebooks should keep their expectations in check. If you have the right scope of what they can do as a computing device you will be very satisfied with your purchase. If you think it will replace your 6 year old Windows laptop it might be able to if the work you do is mostly web dependent.\n\nWhat is a Chromebook to begin with? A Chromebook is a laptop that runs Google's ChromeOS for its Operating System. ChromeOS is a light weight OS based on Linux. The OS is essentially just a Chrome browser, so whatever you can do on Chrome in Windows or Mac you can do on a Chromebook.\n\nWhen I looked at Chromebooks when they first came out I didn't see the appeal of them. I thought they would be never be a device I would want to buy. I was wrong. It turns out Chromebooks can do many things, you just need to list out what they can do, and you need to be happy with their strengths and not worry about their weaknesses.\n\nThings you can do on a Chromebook:\n\n1. Listen to Spotify\n2. Check your Email\n3. Watch Netflix\n4. Write up a document using Google Docs\n5. Create a spreadsheet in Google Docs\n6. Go on YouTube\n7. Browse Amazon and buy stuff\n8. Do simple math using the Calculator app\n9. Play Flash games\n10. Browse ANY website that supports Chrome\n11. The list goes on and on, but these are some things that many people do on a daily basis\n\nThings you can't do / can't do well:\n\n1. Edit photos\n2. Play video games like League of Legends or Starcraft II\n3. Run Quickbooks or any other office application that needs to be installed on the machine\n4. Adobe Creative Cloud software is not supported for Chromebooks\n\nSo as you can see Chromebooks can do a lot of things computing wise. If the things they can do hits all your check boxes then one might be for you.\n\nI really like the Acer CB3-111-C670 with it's white matte finish and black keyboard. The color combination is reminiscent of Apple's old Macbook design, but it is done really well here by Acer. The keyboard and track pad are solid here. They are responsive and the keyboard has a nice tactile feedback and depression with its keys. The track pad is a smooth matte white and also feels great to use.\n\nChromebooks in general are really fast, but this Chromebook boots up in 10 seconds, literally! It also wakes up in less than 3 seconds, so Chromebooks are fast, very fast. Overall, the OS is snappy and I didn't see any hick ups opening up 4 or 5 tabs at once.\n\nThe Acer CB3 is light weighing in at just over 2.5 lbs, which puts it just a hair heavier than an 11.6 inch Macbook Air. This thing is great to use because of its light weight. I also like the screen it's pretty good and the viewing angles aren't terrible on it considering it's a TN panel. The screen itself has a matte finish which does a decent job of reducing window glare.\n\nAcer opted to put an Intel Celeron N2830 into this Chromebook. Many reviewers will say it's not as fast as previous Chromebooks with higher-end processors, but the N2830 is great for several reasons. Even though on paper the N2830 is not as fast as it's predecessors it is better in two ways:\nfirst it consumes less power and second it is completely silent! That's right, the N2830 is fan less, so you won't here a thing while the Chromebook is on, which is a touch. Lastly, the battery life is crazy on this machine. I get about 8 hours of run time on a single charge!!!\n\nIf you need a laptop to take notes, check email, listen to music, stream TV show and Movies, then a Chromebook is ideal for you. If you think it can be your primary computer, it can given the right set of applications you need it to run. For me, I use it on the weekends instead of my work laptop for browsing and checking email. I like it a lot and the price was just right when I bought it, which was $139.\n\nIn a nutshell Chromebooks in general are inexpensive, fast, and can do most things a Windows laptop can do."}

The Tosh had a good run, but then, just like my other Windows computers, it began exhibiting the irritating BSODs, even though I'd had it regularly gone over by the Geek Squad. S and was choosy about putting anything strange on it. So, in a fit of pique I checked out all the chrome books on the market and this seemed to have the best bang for the buck. Turns out, it's terrific for working in flight, and I figured out hoow to get it to print via my HP & Google air print apps. Unlike with my iPad, I can control page range, number of copies, and also save to pdf, etc. I use officeonline.com for most of my documents, but have also found the Google Note app is quite handy for cutting and pasting into, and have gotten more used to Google Docs, etc, which suits most of my needs. Reformatting once I get back online isn't too bad.\n\nI would have rated this a 5 if it didn't have one \"flaw\"-they put an annoying button  where the Caps Lock normally goes that takes you into Chrome, and I keep hitting it by mistake...grrr! Other than that, I really enjoy this little guy and take it purt near everywhere.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "This was the 3rd Chromebook I've purchased in my life and certainly the worst. To be fair the keyboard is quite nice, and the sound and picture are both actually above average by Chromebook standards but that's where the positivity ends. For starters the charger gets plugged into the back of the unit instead of the side, which seems inconsequential but makes charging it more annoying than it needs to be.  As I've stated, I've owned Chromebooks before. I'm familiar with what they can and cannot be expected to do. However, this unit had one of the weakest processors I've ever used. With other Chromebooks (also Acer units, circa 2013) I was comfortably able to surf the web with several links open at once. Things like facebook, youtube, Pandora, gmail etc.could all run concurrently without issue. This hunk o' junk would freeze and crash if i had ANY 3-4 tabs open, even if they were low stress sites with no sound, video or even gifs. And I was using ad block plus to further ease the burden of loading pages. If I tried to use Pandora and tumblr at the same time, oh brother. This thing would seize up and die within 30 seconds, crashing my computer and forcing me to reset. I tolerated this for about 5 days before I had to send it back. Generally I highly recommend Chromebooks to anyone who will listen, but THIS one? Stay away! It's priced cheaply for a reason!"}

If I had to complain I would say the fact that camera doesn't do video and there's no DVD player. No big deal to me but someone younger might have an issue.\nUPDATE: 10/1/15 Haven't really needed a printer since getting the CB, but now realize you have to have a wireless printer or a second laptop/PC to connect to the the cloud. Not a major problem but still a round about way to just print a document."}

First of all you cannot print from this computer unless you have a printer that can connect to the internet. Also if you have an iPhone and access iTunes for your music you will not like this computer. iTunes does not yet have a software available for Chromebook so you will be unable to install it on your Chromebook. I cannot stand Windows 8 and I love google but you cannot access anything without using google in some way. This computer is very good for what I need which is mainly for school. And for the price its pretty great! The computer is very lightweight and easy to use. If you want access to the internet to watch netflix or do homework this computer is awesome. If you want a computer for storing pictures, downloading music etc. do not buy. Altogether this Chromebook suits my needs but I find those two items to be slightly annoying!"}

Take the sticker on the lower right corner off when you get it. The black ink on the sticker started wiping off on the borders around my screen. Also, buy the keyboard cover!! It fits like a glove and I like typing with it a lot more. The keys on this computer are raised off the machine just enough for tiny pieces of dirt or crumbs or anything to get under it and affect the keys. I got the black rubber keyboard cover and i can barely even tell it's on. On a different note, I truly love this computer. I'm a junior in highschool and it's perfect for me to be able to take to and from school and the google drive space is wonderful for all of the group projects I do in my AP courses. It took me about two weeks to get the hang of using chrome OS but the online chat that you can do with chrome support is always super helpful (even for little stuff like not knowing how to delete a program). This machine runs faster than my i3 HP pavilion laptop. On a side note, PLEASE buy yourself a skin or one of those plastic covers because this machine gets scratched pretty easily - especially if you're taking it everywhere with you like I do. LOVE the computer, though!"}

The keyboard is snug and takes some getting used to, especially if your frame of reference is a desktop or larger laptop computer.  The Chrome operating system is efficient although it also takes some getting used to, if Windows is your frame of reference.  It is fully WiFi compatible, and the amount of storage means you can download apps to suit yourself and your anticipated usage.  It does a very respectable job for its size with visual media and movie downloads.  Recommended, but know what you expect out of a computer and read the specs before buying."}

No OS update hassles (or mandatory restarts due to updates)\n3.  Great battery life (average 8-9 hours).\n4.  Good performance (Performs as well as my Windows computer for web browsing).\n5.  Aesthetically pleasing.\n6.  Great at HD video with a crisp anti-glare screen.\n\nThe thing that surprised me the most though,  was the fact that I was able to do about 90% of the things that I do on my Windows PC (including using Microsoft software programs online).\nThe biggest thing that I do on my PC that I couldn't do on my Chromebook,  is burn or play cd's or dvd's.  I did also have a slight issue with the system freezing up briefly on occasion (one time was during a very low battery).\nThe built in microphone also works much better than the one on my Windows PC.

The reviews were good and we went ahead and purchased it for our daughter who mostly needs it for streaming Netflix. For a day or so, it looked to be the perfect fit. However, we were quickly disappointed when it suddenly started losing wireless connectivity every few minutes. The wireless connectivity display indicated that the device was connected, but I could not get to the web or stream video. I attempted to find some help online, but no one seemed to have any fixes that worked. There was a lot of \"never seen this before\" and \"return it - I'm stumped\" answers.\nI'm a computer scientist so naturally I attempted to look under the hood a little bit - to no avail. Nothing I tried kept the chromebook from losing its connectivity to the wireless network. Other devices showed no issues - so I know it isn't my wireless network.\nWhen the chromebook did have connectivity, the signal showed up as being very weak (perhaps 50%), even when it was next to the router. I discovered online that several other chromebooks have had this issue. I'm amazed that this chromebook has so many good reviews when the wireless connectivity is so unreliable. Either the reviews are fake or I just got a lemon. I have some crappy hardware before, but seriously - one day of use and the thing starts to fail? Not very impressed - to say the least. I'll be returning mine for a full refund."}

I live my life in Google drive, so the lack of onboard applications is not an issue for me. (Almost every application you used to have to install now has a web version - most are free even)\nI purchased my Chromebook as a home computer when my IMac finally gave up the ghost.  I couldn't afford to do a full replacement and I needed a computer for home. (I have it connected to a 24\" LCD monitor and my existing sound system via HDMI) For the price, this Chromebook is amazing. It does most basic browsing, email, streaming functions beautifully. Unfortunately, where it chokes is graphics and images.  I'm not talking CAD - I'm talking photo rendering, graphics intensive websites, and even google maps on imagery. The poor little processor just isn't designed to handle that much imagery data. It even stutters when using it's own email (inbox) app. If i could do it,  I'd buy a dedicated desktop as my home base, and use the Chromebook as my mobile computer.\n\nWhat I like:\nLightweight\nAffordable\nCompact\nFast (for basic browsing)\nStreams videos flawlessly\nWell built\nQuiet\nComfortable keyboard\nGreat Touchpad\nBeautiful screen\nNicely integrated with Google and it's various applications\nPlays well with peripherals (external monitor, keyboard, trackball)\n\nWhat I don't like\nChokes on graphic intensive processing (Google earth/maps)\nChokes on Google photos (caveat - I have nearly 20,000 photos in my google drive)\nChokes on photo enhancement (again - graphic intensive)\nSlow on it's own email (Google Inbox)  - this really irritates me.\nHas trouble streaming music and multitasking (I've never been a fan of streaming music services anyway.  I have yet to find one that is consistent and stable.) It works fine for streaming music by itself, but I'm usually working and doing other things while I'm listening at my computer, and it frequently stutters as the processor overloads.\nYou have to be very aware of how many browser tabs you have open. 5 or more and you start having issues.\n\nI know you're saying \"But the Chromebook isn't DESIGNED to be a rendering powerhouse!\"  I would totally agree with you - except when it comes to  Google's own applications (Inbox, Maps)\n\nSummary -  I really think this Chromebook is a well thought out, well-designed unit. It does what it is designed for very well.  My concern is that as web pages become more information packed, the processing power is going to have to be boosted."}

They were kind enough to send a combo modem-wireless router, which I promptly installed.\n\nHowever, this is where the problems began. The existing family phones, tablets, linux and chromebooks seemed to run a bit slower while accessing the network. I also decided to upgrade to this current model Chromebook, thinking that with a new modem-wifi unit from Comcast this would be the ticket to a better web experience - matching new ISP wifi equipment with new Chromebook wifi technology ;)\n\nI was wrong. The new Chromebook 11 wouldn't even start-up or complete the Gmail registration and Chromeos update process :-O\n\nI was almost ready to return the Chromebook 11, when my new Archer C9 wireless router and Arris SurfBoard cable modem arrived today via Amazon Prime. So I decommissioned my brand new Comcast combo modem-wifi and set up the Archer-Arris units in a few minutes.\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/ARRIS-SURFboard-SB6141-DOCSIS-3-0-Cable-Modem-Retail-Packaging-White/dp/B00AJHDZSI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">ARRIS SURFboard SB6141 DOCSIS 3.0 Cable Modem - Retail Packaging - White</a>\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/TP-LINK-Archer-C9-AC1900-Dual-Band-Wireless-AC-Gigabit-Router-2-4GHz-600Mbps-5Ghz-1300Mbps-1-USB-2-0-Port-1-USB-3-0-Port-IPv6-Guest-Network/dp/B00PDLRHFW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">TP-LINK Archer C9 AC1900 Dual Band Wireless AC Gigabit Router, 2.4GHz 600Mbps+5Ghz 1300Mbps, 1 USB 2.0 Port & 1 USB 3.0 Port, IPv6, Guest Network</a>\n\nAnd then, with extraordinary speed, the Chromebook 11 completed the set-up and I able to watch HD YouTube. Keep in mind that the 2G RAM limitation will limit concurrent tabs (especially flash-heavy adds on each page) even if you don't run HD video in one tab. But, I'm satisfied, because for under $200 I have a very portable and usable Chromebook - with very good battery life :)\n\nComcast stopped their support when one device connected and speed test is was about half of the advertised bandwidth.\n\nAcer has no idea about ISP on-premise equipment, and has no guidelines for working vs. non-working wireless routers and cable modems. Google wanted to help, but couldn't offer (or take) much information regarding wifi-modem-ISP compatibility and Chromebook hardware models."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "The Chromebook concept is excellent.  I chose this model because it had a faster processor.  I'm not sure if that makes a difference, but my big mistake was to settle for the 11-inch display.  That size is fine for watching a movie, but when it comes to reading web sites, I always have to result to Ctrl+ in order for my old eyes to make out the text. And there's no 'plus' key available except with the shift key over the = key.  Another thing that's an annoyance that doesn't really rise to the level of dissatisfaction is that there are no cursor keys like Home, End, PageUp and PageDown.  Makes the navigation a little tedious.\n\nHaving cited the Cons, I have to say that the PROS are the instant availability of the entire content of my Google account, the easy transparency of the downloaded Chrome OS, the fantastic battery life, the light weight and sturdy construction of the case, and the 10-second boot time.  Great idea, those Chromebooks.  Next time I buy one, I'll spring for a bigger display, maybe 13 inches."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "Build: This Chromebook is super light.  Carrying it one handed is very easy and it's barely noticeable in a backpack.  The keyboard is decent and easy to type on.  The track pad is large enough and perfectly functional.  Finger gestures for scrolling, clicking, swiping, etc work every time and never go off accidentally.  They just work wonderfully.  Speakers are small, but adequate.  I would recommend headphones for any serious listening.  The biggest positive in the build is the fanless design.  This laptop has no fan and barely gets warm.\n\nScreen: All I can say is adequate.  It is completely usable.  It has a matte finish which is ideal.  A normal user wouldn't notice anything at all.  It's just a very typical screen.  It's not a vibrant as a high end tv, monitor, or even a nice smart phone.  But, it is way better than a screen on a $100 tablet.\n\nBattery Life: Under normal browsing, I can use this for several days between charges.  I would estimate about 11 or so hours of on screen time between charges.  Under heavier use, I have streamed video on this for 8 hours straight before the battery warning came on.  Battery life is fantastic.\n\nOther: Boot time is around 5 seconds + 10 seconds to log into Google.  Shutdown time is about 10 seconds.  The Chromebook is very responsive and never lags.  2 gb of ram is just fine even with tons of tabs open, including video streams and things like that.  I have also loaded the 16 GB of storage with video when traveling on an airplane.  Plus, you can load up a big memory stick with additional media and play from that too.  The super long battery life makes it great to travel with and watch media from."}

I needed in the under $200 price range and I needed portability.  I use google all the time for most all my business and home needs even on my desktop PC.  However I was leery of not having a cd drive and internal memory.\nLong story short I found a laptop for under $200 and this at this great price. I bought both.\nA few days after purchase I broke out the laptop first and set it up.  Set up took forever, windows 8 wasn't playing nice, etc.  Finally set up and I jumped on my google drive to create a syllabus for my Science class I am teaching this fall.  The crazy laptop would NOT stay connected to the WiFi it was SUPER slow to respond, and it took me hours to get anything done, even after spending much time deleting apps, etc.  I realized it was a super cheap laptop, but still, even my OLD (8 year old) laptop gave a better performance than the new one.  Also the laptop battery was dead in 3 to 4 hours even on super saver settings.\nFast forward a few hours I grabbed this Chromebook and opened it up.  I was up and running in MINUTES, typed in my google identity and VOILA there I was, all my bookmarks, history, etc.  Went to drive and had a little bit of a problem while trying to edit my document...saw an update icon in the corner, clicked it, updated the Chrome OS and VOILA no more problems.  I was on the Chromebook for over 8 hours with no charge and still had plenty of battery left.  I set up accounts for my entire family, my business and school.  It starts up and wakes up super quickly, I had no problems working with documents from word after google found the right extension for me, it hits my WiFi and stays connected no matter where I go, it is light weight but still feels sturdy and tough.  I need another portable laptop or chromebook for my son to carry on his class days this fall.  I am thinking we will be purchasing another chromebook and just saving any PC stuff we need done for the desktop.\n\nPros\nAffordable, quick, sturdy, lightweight, fast, easy to use and set up, familiar Chrome system, can work on or offline with most Chrome programs now, LONG LONG battery life\nCons\nno number pad, no internal storage to speak of, no cd drive, does require internet connection more than a laptop.

They're not complete computers, but they do about 90% of what you need to do at a great price, and they are LOW maintenance. This one has a great combination of features and enough horsepower with the Celeron to have acceptable response. The price is quite low, but you get what you pay for. This brand new laptop was delivered with a loose trackpad that rattles when you touch it. It's too annoying to use. I had to send it back to be fixed. Acer's quality control is not up to the standard of its competitors. I lived through the \"netbook\" era and went through quality control problems with two Acer netbooks at that time. Looks like things have not changed. Time blunted my memory. I should have remembered not to be blinded by absolute low price.  If this Chromebook is acceptably repaired, then it will still have value, but I fear that it may become a $150 write-off."}

Even after it was installed and working well, It had the start screen informing me that the \"OS Verification was turned off\" After several seconds, it would eventually go ahead and go into the OS.  After working with Google AGAIN, they suggested I return it to Amazon for another unit, as the laptop was \"stuck, apparently in the 'developer' mode\", and they didn't know how to get it out of that..... *sigh*  After looking at some of the reviews, I found out I wasn't the only one that received one without an Operating System on it!

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "I've had it a month now, and I like everything about the Acer Chromebook.  It took a minute to get used to the touchpad's two-finger scrolling, and for certain things like highlighting text or spreadsheet cells for copying, I plug in a USB mouse.  I can do everything I need to do on the chromebook except upload pictures from my camera.  I'd already committed to Google Drive for storing and editing files, so there was no transition pain.  Battery life is a pleasant surprise on this Acer--it really is as advertised, if you shut down when you aren't using it.  (Push the on/off button for a second, then click on \"shut down\".  Obviously, you can't be in the middle of something if you're going to do this.)  If you leave it on standby (by simply closing the lid), the battery drains slowly the whole time.  Chromebooks come up so quickly it's not even inconvenient to do a full startup--it takes a few seconds.  It charges quickly too, albeit from a mini-brick charger twice as big as a typical phone charger.  The keyboard is fine, though I miss a dedicated delete key, and the top row has all the important net-navigating actions right there  (back, forward, reload) as well as mute, volume up, volume down, brightness up, brightness down.  It's very light and seems to pick up wi-fi signals well.  Be advised that it may tell you it isn't connected even though it is.  It comes up with your pages pretty quickly, although presumably to save power and bandwidth I notice that it usually waits until you open a tab for the first time before it loads the page.  That's fine with me.  The screen is quite readable, really very nice.  At this price, this device is a steal."}

The Acer was getting great reviews, and is/was one of the very best sellers in the category.  With an attractive price even lower than the older Samsung it seemed like a no-brainer to go with the Acer.\n\nAs mentioned, it is intended as a gift, so upon arrival I at least wanted to open it up, connect to the internet, and be certain that everything was in working order.  For the few minutes I had it on I could confirm that the computer was attractive (in white), looked to be well built, and that the speakers and display were both better than the older, more expensive Samsung.  I think I prefer the keyboard of the Samsung, but that might be because of familiarity.  Besides, unless I'm travelling, the Samsung is docked on the desk and I'm using a full-size desktop keyboard.\n\nIn summary, I like the Acer in overall terms, and if buying a new Chromebook today it would be my choice.\n\nAbout Chrome:\n\nMay not be for everyone.  Doesn't do it all, but many reviewers say it covers 95% of their needs and that fees about right.  The OS updates automatically, and since nothing downloads there's little worry over viruses.  The computer sprints from website to website.  Starts up within seconds.  Battery lasts all day.  So, so much faster than the old Windows experience.  I definitely would not go back.\n\nThe downsides and limitations of Chrome that I have found are that you cannot print with a normal, plug-in, USB printer.  The printer needs to be Google approved, cloud ready wireless printer.  Or, as I do, you can have a conventional computer connected to your network, and print through that.  I kept an old Lenovo netbook with Windows XP solely for that purpose.  Also, you cannot use Skype with Chrome and that is disappointing."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "I bought this laptop as basically a toy. I have a large and powerful desktop I use for graphic design work, and a couple clunky laptops I use and abuse for other purposes. I wanted a new laptop with a long battery and basic functions I could use for flights and while out and about. This one is small enough to fit in my bag, light enough to comfortably bring with me anywhere, and can run almost as long as I can.\n\nPros: lightweight, silent, and never overheats. I can watch 5-7 hours of video (depending on if it's streaming or not) and still have some juice left. It is efficient enough to not overheat, and even on sticky 90 degree days, have in my lap with no discomfort. I use this heavily for business and work, as well as play, and does all that and more at a very reasonable price.\n\nCons: While efficient, it is still a Chromebook. Chromium reminds me of a very, very stripped down OS X. While mostly intuitive, a lot of the customization I've grown used to with Linux and the mac OS is lost here. It's not necessary to do what I need it to do, but the personal touch is something I enjoy on every machine I use and miss here. In addition, when stressed, the system can occasionally get bogged down. I found myself with several tabs open on Chrome and trying to use google Docs, and the system slowed to crawl. I didn't have to reboot, simply close out of chrome and reload what I was doing, but it was still a hassle.\n\nHonestly, the biggest drawback to this machine is also it's greatest strength. The inherent and core Google integration means everything I use and access on other machines is instantly at my fingertips. It also means that without an internet connection, you lose almost everything, and when trying to multitask, you run the risk of stressing the machine so heavily that everything is compromised while you try and calm the beast down.\n\nOverall, I love this machine. It does exactly what I need and it does it exceptionally well. (Don't let the cons scare you away, I just tried to find every nit-picky detail. I hate reviews that leave a high rating with no potential pitfalls.) Don't buy this computer expecting an incredibly powerful device. Rather, spend the money and get an excellent toy and tool."}

I can't believe how quickly the price went up on Amazon, thankfully I got mine at $120. My only gripe is how quickly it can run out of memory and refreshes the tabs in a programmed succession, but that's only because I have like a dozen extensions running and 8-10 tabs open at any given time, the average user probably utilizes much less. Thankfully the situation has been much improved after I enabled \"Swap\" to get extra virtual ram through the use of my SSD. Besides, the same thing would happen in a comparable 4Gb model but less noticeable, it's just the way the OS is setup. The 100Gb Google Drive offer is also a bonus and practically costs the same as the computer itself. Also you can run Linux on it if you want but I didn't even consider it because I'm enjoying ChromeOS so much, it's only going to get better and better over time.

Looked at Google, you can make one, but you need to access it via the Chromebook, but you can't connect to create one.  There is no customer service to help out.  It was so frustrating because there were so many positive reviews and I did my research.  This was a gift.  Needless to say, it is getting packed up and shipped back.  I guess I will stick with the reliable and proven Apple products (tablets, computers, laptops), they may cost more, but they work!!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "Purchased for a student who is the first in her family to head off to college. This budget-friendly Acer Chromebook fit her needs perfectly and at the right price. The island-style keyboard, USB (2.0 and 3.0) ports, HDMI port, webcam and 11.6\" screen size were all appealing to her, but the Acer brand and price under one-forty really peaked her interest.  After we watched a few YouTube videos on it she was sold!\n\nChromebooks are a great way for non-techs to view web content, email, and do basic computing tasks with the Google Drive suite of apps. They also offer the ability to watch Hulu and Netflix (with subscriptions - not included) and use social media. Perfect for kids to do homework, grandparents to email, and anyone who wants a cheap, lightweight laptop but who doesn't need a wired connection (Chromebooks are Wifi only) or the ability to use software not available as an app in the Google Play Store.\n\nThat being said, this is a great value if it fits your needs. It has great performance even with only 2GB of memory and a Celeron processor, and offers a lot of features for the low price point.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nThings I like about this product:\n\n+ The low price!\n\n+ Quick to boot, this one takes less than 10 seconds to be ready to go!\n\n+ Up to 8.5 hours of battery life per full charge.\n\n+ Sleek, think profile with weight at only 2.43 pounds. ( Perfect for carrying around in a backpack or messenger bag at school.)\n\n+ Capable of new 'ac' wireless standard - fastest available when used with ac wireless routers.\n\n+ Fanless design means it's 'silent' when running, but still runs efficiently cool.\n\n+ HDMI port means you can hook it up to your HDTV and use it as a big monitor.\n\n+ 11.6\" anti-glare display allows you to use the Chromebook outside without a reflection.\n\n+ 100 GB of FREE Google Drive Storage for 2 years (after redeeming offer) is good across all your PCs, tablets, Chromebooks, and Mac when accessing Google Drive.\n\n+ Gogo 12 month internet pass included.\n\n+ Music on Google Play - free for 60 days.\n\n+ No need to install an antivirus software on a Chrome OS.\n\n+ Bluetooth 4.0 connectivity works to add external speakers and headphones, and sync Chromebook with other devices.\n\n+ Webcam resolution in HD: 1280 x 720.\n\n+ 1 year limited warranty.\n\n-------------------------\n\nWhat I wish was better...\n\n+/- Celeron processor is cheap and not as fast as higher end Intel processors, but it keeps the Chromebook price down and works with the Google Chrome operating system well enough.\n\n+/- Screen resolution is 1366 x 768 which is not HD quality, but at this screen size, you can't really notice.\n\n+- Flash memory (internal) for operating system and general storage is only 16GB, half of which is already used by the operating system when you get it. Not a surprise, and if you effectively use external flash drives and your Google Drive account (and others), you'll be in good shape.\n\n+/- The speakers are OK, but certainly not high quality.  There's an audio out port to add external speakers and you can use headphones (with or without a microphone); line in or Bluetooth with this Chromebook.\n\n+/- The Chromebook has a SD card reader near the USB 3.0 port, however the card sticks out versus docking in a way that is flush with the Chromebook.\n\n+/- I think all Chromebooks should come with 4GB of memory as a standard - not 2GB.  There's no way to upgrade the device either.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nWhat the Chromebook CB3-111-C670 does not have...\n\n- No optical drive. (This is the case with all Chromebooks, but you can get a USB driven optical drive to use with it, however you need to check the Chromebook website for a list of supported external devices like drives, keyboards and mice.)\n\n- No backlighting on the keyboard.\n\n- Skype is currently not supported on Chromebooks.\n\n- NO ethernet port; Wifi only!\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nThe college-bound student I purchased this Chromebook for LOVES it! After having purchased two others (for my tech-challenged step-father and husband), I'm sold on their usefulness and ease of use.\n\nIf you are in need of a laptop for your elementary, middle, high school or college aged child to carry around and do web-based homework, this is worth considering. It's also a good choice for non-tech types who have trouble using Windows or Mac computers.\n\nNote that it's necessary to have a wireless connection to use it, and it doesn't work with Skype. There's no optical (CD or DVD drive) in it, but some external accessories are supported.  The internal memory and flash drive are not upgradeable - it is what it is, but if it's what you need and you don't mind using cloud storage and the Google apps for programs - it's wonderful!\n\nAt this low price point it's tough to beat for internet surfing, email, and social media, as well as using the Google Drive suite of apps. Definitely a product that is well made and does what it promises to do. I highly recommend it!\n\n------------------------\n-------------------------"}

This chromebook is just the right size, it's not too small (I originally owned a Acer Aspire Netbook, which was awesome, but a little too small.) This Chromebook is not huge like a laptop, which I always struggle with manuevring on my lap. But this Chromebook does take some getting used to but so far it all has been seamless. I did have a few issues with the chromebook freezing up, but since I was able to do a reboot, it seems to have been running fine since. (Which you just hold Ctrl + in the top row of keys the circle with the arrow) And it is amazingly fast at rebooting. Which I had made lots of changes in the settings and had added my wireless printer and I was not sure on how to do a reboot being as when you do make changes, it's best to reboot your laptop, computer, etc. Also, to right click in which to copy, paste, open in new tab, etc, You just click the fingerpad with two fingers. Tada! I feel like a whiz kid. lol\n\nI love how this chromebook feels lightweight and while having it on my lap, does not get hot like my netbook would. The materials do feels a little cheap. But for the price, I'm not complaining.\n\nI did pick this up at Target since it is on sale this week for $129, plus Cartwheel gives you an extra 5% plus Red Card another 5%. So the price I paid is about $110.\n\nI will be using this for my business, I sell on eBay and Etsy. And when I need to revise my listings, or create new ones, I can do this from the comfort of my couch instead of sitting at my desk. I love that this comes with Google Drive storage for 2 years. I was planning on purchasing Amazon Cloud, but will use Drive in the meantime.\n\nI have only had this 3 days and will update this as I move along. I was a little bummed that I can't down iTunes to this. I would have loved to have the ability to rip my music cd's to iTunes on my down times, plus then I don't have to haul music cd's up to the second level of my house. :)"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "I am just an average Tech Junkie.  Love new things and research them to death.  I bought 2 of these, one for college child and one for me.  Was looking for something lightweight, compact, able to stream to TV, and dependable.  Acer products first of all are on the whole dependable.  I was waiting for ASUS 4gb ram price to hit my buy point as had fears of 2gb ram hindering the video portion.  I daily, and hourly would watch the prices of my targeted models and, Sorry Amazon, had to go elsewhere because price of this was better than I expected. ANyway, the review,\n First 2 gb vs 4 gb of ram.  For our purposes, doesn't matter.  Open up multiple tabs and stream more than one movie and music simultaneously and you might experience lag.  But for my purpose of one video at a time it has been great.  My child has had 5 windows open, listening to music and has been able to browse on the 5 with no lag.\nSpeakers on the system are functional for listening to, but if for music this is bought, then do what we do.  With the much appreciated Bluetooth capabilities, we just pair them to our Bose Soundlink system and have the quality of audio we appreciate.  The keyboard keys are responsive, the touchpad a little too finicky out of the box but easliy remedied in settings. Anyway, will eventually get bluetooth mouse.  Feature I love is that this thing is instantly on, no boot time.  The display is adequate, not HD but who cares for everday use?  The Chrome operating system is moot point for complainers.  Don't care about not having Word or other MS office products...could download the app but will use Google Docs.\nPORTABILITY:  wow, light as a feather, fits in daughter's purse for cross campus walks.  Will be much more convenient for me to carry through airports than my old lenovo laptop which is still very windows 7 functional.\nTHE CON...my only, and I mean only wish was that we had access to Google play store app and not the supplied version.  Not a deal breaker but\njust a wish.\nRECOMMEND.  All being said, I recommend this for the average guy.  Don't ask me about gaming or photoshopping, or other beyond basic functions, this machine is highly recommended by me for the portabilty and ability to do basic day to day computer functions at a price that can't be beat."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "I purchased this machine as a complement to my two year old 17\" Toshiba Satellite Windows laptop. I wanted something smaller and lighter that would boot quickly and had a keyboard. I saw this at a special price of $129 and scooped it up.\n\nI have used the machine quite a bit over the first five days I have owned it, and have a pretty good feel for it already.\n\nThe outer shell is plastic, but still feels solid and sturdy in my hands despite its light weight. I have been pleasantly surprised with the keyboard and track pad. They both give great feedback and work well. The screen has a matte finish, and the viewing angles are okay. The screen opens to nearly flat if needed, offering a wide range of viewing angles to choose from.\n\nBeing accustomed to a larger screen, the 11.6\" screen felt a little small at first. I got over that in no time. Besides, that isn't an issue with the machine. An 11.6 inch laptop is going to be 11.6\". I will say that the resolution and colors on this machine are not as vivid as they are on a more powerful machine. WIth this being my secondary machine, I'm okay with that. I put the two machines side by side, and you could really see the difference. Alone though, I didn't notice it. I watched an HBO program on this machine, and it performed flawlessly.\n\nThe boot time is ridiculously fast, and the battery life is great...up to ten hours at a time. Charging takes a surprisingly short period of time.\n\nI'm fine with using Google docs for most work related things. For those I can't, I can use Office online without issue.\n\nThe wireless card works really well, and pages boot quickly. I've read some things about slowness with multiple tabs open, but I have yet to experience that.\n\nI have a printer that supports Google Cloud Print, so this works for me in that respect as well. I understand that printers that don't support cloud print can pose a problem for Chroembooks.\n\nI would say that anyone who wants to use this as a secondary machine, it is a bargain. For anyone that wants to use it as a primary machine, it will work quite well unless you have specific programs you need that can't be accessed online. For those that are unaware, monst normal programs can't be loaded onto this machine. That's an issue for some people, but for many, this is a great machine, especially if you're on a budget.\n\nOne last thing...sort through a list of keyboard shortcuts and remember the ones you'll need most. Many are quite useful. You'll need to use them for something like a right click on the tracking pad. The Chrome OS is familiar, but it does have a few quirks you'll want to learn about."}

However, if you need more computer functions such as storing data, photos, etc. I would recommend going with a real laptop.

For example, my cell phone wouldn't connect so I had to find another way to transfer photos onto my removable hard drive. Hope this review helps!"}

Sure, they work great for a bit, but then, like always, they get slow, they start losing functionality. They are all but dead and another few hundred dollars are gone.\n\nAnd then I bought a Chromebook.\n\nLet me be clear, I don't just browse. I bought my Chromebook for graduate school, and everytime, the Chromebook has exceeded the expectations I set for it. I typed my papers (including my thesis) on this trusty little notebook without ever worrying if it saved, if I could access it, anything.\n\nThat's because the Chromebook is designed for busy folks on the go. My Chromebook can go from completely off, to me surfing the web, in about 10-15 seconds. My work is saved to Google Drive and updates as I go. My calendar, my email, my quick notes, everything, is available to me anywhere.\n\nLet's be clear, you have to sign your life over to Google for this to be worth your while. Get an Android phone. Use Google Calendar, use Gmail, use Hangouts, use Google Docs, use Google Keep, use Google Photos. If you're willing to do that, then the Chromebook can serve as your hub for all things Google.\n\nInstead of getting slower, my Chromebook has gotten faster the more I use it. It's like it anticipates my moves. The typing interface is smooth (very similar to Apple). I love the tracking pad that doesn't require \"clicks\" but just taps. It has an HDMI hookup (I used it to watch March Madness on my TV), two USB ports, and an SD card slot.\n\nThis is rambling but it's because I can't say enough good things about the Chromebook. If for some reason this bites it, then I will absolutely buy a new one. Quit playing around with the expensive Apples, the unreliable HPs, the slow Dells. This is what you need."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "Seven months ago, while on a trip to Las Vegas (I'm from Canada), we went to Best Buy to purchase the Acer C720P.  However, they were no longer selling that model and instead had this one.  I was a little disappointed because I did so much research on the C720P, but I bought this anyways as I wanted to try Chromebook.\n\nFast forward to today....my girlfriend and I LOVE it!  No surprise that the Acer CB3-111 is currently the best-selling laptop on Amazon.  We use it every day.  My girlfriend bought a bigger Samsung 15.4\" laptop just last year but she rarely uses that.  Reason being the Chromebook is so light and fast to boot up.  You open the lid and it just starts working with no hassles.  Unlike Windows.\n\nPros:\n*******\n- SMALL AND LIGHT.  Especially when lying in bed or on the couch.  I also take it with me everywhere.  Just toss it into a bag and go.\n\n- ANTI-GLARE SCREEN.  One major aspect this Acer stood apart from others was the screen.  It has a matte anti-glare screen which is nice because I hate looking at reflections.  Moreover, all the other Chromebooks seemed to have a subtle fuzziness around the edges of icons and text no matter how high or low I set the resolution.  Whereas, this Acer is crisp and clear.\n\n- CHROME OS.  Chromebooks, in general, are so nice.  Much of my activity is on the web these days and Chrome OS is built for that.  The operating system is just so simple, yet has everything I need.  Furthermore, all my Chrome extensions followed me onto the Chromebook which made it seamless.\n\n- NO FAN.  No noise.  Gets a little warm, but never hot.\n\n- TRACKPAD.  Love the 2 and 3 finger taps and gestures.  No need for a mouse.\n\n- BATTERY LIFE.  Super long battery life.  I never worry about battery when I go out with it.\n\n- PRICE.  Unbelievable value for such a cheap price!  Additionally, I find I take it out with me more than I would a laptop because if this breaks or gets stolen, I won't be too upset.  I can always buy another and my data is in the cloud.\n\nCons:\n*******\n- NOT SUPER FAST.  Definitely not as fast as a PC.  You can't have 10 tabs open playing videos and music -- you will notice a lag.  But for regular use, it's perfect."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "Complaints are usually the order of the day, so ... . First, this machine is compact and light, which is one reason I bought it. I don't really notice it in my backpack, which I can't say about my Asus laptop. This Chromebook comes with a USB 3 and a USB 2 and an SD card reader. I regularly use the USB 3 port with a 64GB USB flash drive where I store music and files I need and it works well. The keyboard is responsive and big enough for me although I often hit the <enter> key instead of the single quote. I was (and probably still am) unfamiliar with Chromebooks in general, so I've done some looking for things like keyboard shortcuts and the like (<alt><backspace> for delete is one example). The touchpad works well. I usually disable them on laptops and only use an attached mouse, but I am comfortable using this one (although I do often use a Bluetooth mouse for spreadsheet work and the like). The battery typically lasts 6.5 to 7 hours with WiFi connected, Bluetooth active and listening to music while I work, so that's a big plus. WiFi generally connects easily and efficiently and so far I've had no problems. So far, so good. Now the complaints. Bluetooth often drops the signal, but even that's just annoying. The truly maddening problem is (I'm guessing) the 2GB of RAM. I'm a researcher and do a lot of quantitative work. I've found Google Sheets and Docs to be a little to \"lite\" for what I need, but MS Office 365 (or Live - whatever they call it) works better. The problem is that with a few Chrome windows open with a just few tabs each, moving from one tab to another essentially requires the tab to be reloaded. I might be switching from a spreadsheet to a Word doc, to OneDrive, to Gmail and one or more seems to have been bumped out of RAM. Frustrating. I think I would go for a model with more RAM and see if that helps with this performance issue. The nice thing about Chromebooks in general is that the cloud is developing so that I can do just about everything I need using the Chromebook. I mentioned MS Office 365, there are online LaTex editors, one can use R through Amazon Web Services, so I can do just about anything I might do with an ordinary laptop - just a little less conveniently, but with a much more portable form factor. Overall, Chromebooks over great value. Depending on what you do with it, this model may be all you need."}

My children are aged 6, 5, and 4 and with no prior computer experience are now easily using the Internet to access online learning programs.  These programs run smoothly and quickly on this chrome book while on my own very pricey laptop can be slow and glichy.  The keys are perfect for my children as they are not overly sensitive and have a real keyboard feel. The size is perfect, allowing for nice quality graphics, but is not cumbersome or too heavy for the children to have on their lap during use. The chrome book also suprised me in the it doesn't feel cheap, it actually feels substantial despite its very light weight. I am so happy with this that I am buying another one for my mother so she can also have an easy to use machine to access the Internet without a hassel."}

Updating is automatic. I bought it as a kitchen table machine for browsing, email and Facebook.  That is 95% of what we use computers for in this house (we don't game). I have a desktop for heavy lifting. A big plus over checking gmail on an iPad is that you can get the regular Gmail site and not the horrid grouped mobile gmail that you are required to use with iPads.

This is everything I need in a laptop and  it's perfect for my budget. If you are a fan of Chrome and Google this will be right up your alley as all of your applications will utilize Google's OS, which is their repertoire of applications.\nFor example:\nGoogle Hangouts instead of Skype\nGoogle Docs instead of Word\nYou can download apps such as Spotify, Evernote, Dropbox which work within the browser. Again, after doing my research I found I can do pretty much everything I need with a laptop through Google's OS so this is perfect for me right now.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "I bought a refurb for $110 and love the CB3, after installing Crouton (Ubuntu) and Wine for the one Windows program I need for work. Crouton/Ubuntu does not work perfectly with the Chrome OS keyboard yet, but I have not played much with the scripts out there designed to fix the problems. Crouton/Ubuntu allows one to get around the limitation of Chrome OS's browser-only approach to Linux: I have a full version of LibreOffice to create and modify MS Office docs. Switching back and forth between Chrome OS and Crouton/Ubuntu takes only seconds. The two OSs share the /Downloads folder, so files one downloads in Chrome OS can be modified in LibreOffice.\nI dislike Google Docs and Drive, so I use Dropbox and OneDrive/MS Office online. But mostly I take notes on the CB3 using a nice tabbed text editor called Caret in Chrome OS (offline). This works very well for meetings, lectures, etc.\nI prefer a 14 inch laptop, but the screen and chiclet keyboard on the CB3 are quite nice. Sometimes my thumbs hit the large trackpad and lose the cursor where I am typing, which is annoying, but I also like the pad because I do not have to find the mouse buttons: I can press most areas of the pad to get button response. The Chromebook keyboard itself has a learning curve, but at least it gets rid (hides, really) of the stupid caps lock key just to the left of the A key. The one thing I do not like about the keyboard is that the key letters are lower case, which (for some reason) are harder to see in dim light. I suppose this will not be a problem when I acclimate fully to the keyboard and can touch type.\nBefore I bought the CB3 I researched a bit and found an article that likened the Chromebook to an iPad. Although I resisted using a Bluetooth keyboard with my iPad 3, which is mostly for media now, I see the point. For all areas of productivity, I prefer the EB3 Chromebook to my iPad."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "I was debating between a Chromebook and a tablet but ultimately decided on a Chromebook so I could resume my writing hobby and have an actual keyboard. This is one of the cheapest ones I've found on here and I've had it for a while and it works perfectly for everything I use a computer for: writing (with google docs), watching things on Netflix, Amazon Instant Video, & Youtube (streams fast with nice video quality), checking Gmail, browsing nonsensical stuff on Reddit, etc. I also will be using it to go on online classes. Chrome has always been my go-to browser and I am not sure if you can download other browsers. It works on googles operating system. I'm used to windows so I thought this may be an issue for me but it wasn't. There are tons of apps like the kindle app which are perfect for reading. The speaker volume is average. I have a noisy house so I like to use headphones. It comes with small mic hole that is on the left upper side of the monitor. I purchased headphones that came with a mic but had two different cables for the headphones and the mic. Since there is only one slot for the headphones/mic in the Chromebook, I purchased an adapter which you can find for less than $10 that allows you to combine and plug in both jacks. Love this book!\n\nEasy and fast to set up. Most of the things on this chrome book, you have to access through the internet otherwise you can't do much. It connected to my Wi-Fi with no problems. If you let someone use it you can have them sign in as a guest and they can web browse.\n\nI don't play games so I have no idea how it works with games. But when I did my overall research it seems it's not a good computer for gamers who like to play things on Steam, etc... Also from my research, there are things like Skype that you can't use but it's a non-issue for me personally since I don't use Skype.\n\nBattery life is excellent. I dislike using the touchpad most of the time so I bought an AmazonBasics 3-Button USB Wired Mouse and it works perfectly with this chromebook (and it's a good price too!). I also bought an AmazonBasics 11.6-Inch Laptop Sleeve and it fits super well. Great price for that too!\n\nThere is a built in webcam and I was surprised that the quality is pretty good if you are in good lighting.\n\nWorth every penny! I'm very happy with my purchase."}

Did my research and was realistic about my budget and knew I just needed a simple computer for personal use (blogging, Netflix, writing, online shopping, reading articles, emailing). I'm really happy with what I got for a very low price.\n\nPurchased it in April, here are the highlights:\n-Can't beat the ridiculous battery life, it actually does last all day. Charges very quickly too.\n-Ten tabs open -- no problem. This thing is beastly fast because it has nothing extra slowing it down.\n-Webcam quality is quite nice. Have had some hassle-free Hangouts with my family.\n-Googling Chrome apps and plugins usually turns up some satisfactory stand-in for old PC software functions that work fine enough for me.\n-Stays cool, doesn't give me that terrible laptop thigh burn! Haha.\n-Really light! I stow it in my backpack and notice no weight difference.\n-Biggest selling point: feels, acts and looks like a much more expensive computer. The keyboard has the PERFECT feel -- light touch, not too clicky (reminds me of a Mac) and the plastic casing feels really premium. Screen isn't flimsy, and the brightness is surprisingly powerful.\n-Runner-up selling point: awesome, awesome speakers. I use my laptop mostly for listening to music, movies and podcasts, and the sound is consistently clear, not tinny or cheap at all (much better quality than any laptop I've ever used before).\n\nThis Chromebook is simple and reliable and I love it quite a lot. It probably isn't the best move for a college student or designer who relies on software heavily, but for everyone else in the world, esp people not rolling around in money, I can't imagine you being unhappy with this delightful device."}

It is soooo light, easy to have on one's lap or in the bathroom or to carry about. I basically got this to do my online stuff and spare my larger laptop from wear and tear. It's a delight. It's not as fast as, say, a MAC or a more powerful computer, but this little baby is handy, easy peasy to set up and use. I do find that if may not be very smooth if I have a lot of windows or tabs open, so I gotta remember to close down some tabs. If you like reading on a larger screen in the bathroom (yeah, yeah, lighting is nice in there), this and my Kindles both are great.\n\nThe keys are a little close together cuz it's a smaller size, but the keys feel good to type on.\n\nI liked it enough that I got hubby one, too. :) This way, he if he doesn't need the weight or power of his MacBook, he can just use this out and about or for social media stuff while we're watching TV.\n\nFun little machine. Not perfect, but I love it all the same.\n\nUpdate: I've had this baby for 10 days and use it ALOT. It's so handy. However, I will point out that your sound might go off on occasion. Only happened to me once, but when I googled it, it seems to happen with this chromebook now and then. Just turn it off and turn it back on. Sound returns. :D"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "I love this thing. Back when chromebooks were initially being released, I thought they were the dumbest thing ever. They don't allow for MS Office and other programs that I need to use pretty often, so that was a turn off. However, as Google Drive/Docs has developed throughout the years, I've been able to be nearly as productive without needing those programs. So, I had a change of heart about the usefulness of Chromebooks, and besides, 95% of the time I spend on a computer is on the internet, as is the case with the majority of people.\n\nWhen I saw this on sale for only $150, I decided to give it a go after reading reviews, and it's the best purchase I've made all year. The battery life is amazing. It's fast and can surprisingly handle my heavy usage very well most of the time (I'm one of those people with 20 tabs open at once all the time). I never turn it off, so whenever I open this up it is immediately ready to go. It hasn't shown any signs of slowing down, and with the Chrome OS, I don't expect it to. The speakers on this are also ridiculously good for the price. I was not expecting that at all, but they've blown me away. I'm a musician, and I'm really picky about quality of speakers, but these are absolutely awesome.\n\nGuys and gals, do not look any further - go ahead and buy this. A few months after buying this for only $150, BestBuy had it for $130 and I bought it (FYI, Amazon price matches computers). I ended up taking it back because I had convinced myself to buy the HP Stream 11 and giving my mom this Acer CB3 Chromebook, but ended up not buying it afterward because of the nightmare of dealing with Windows 8, but mostly because all of my Windows computers have gradually slowed over time. Taking back my second purchase of this device was the biggest mistake I've made in a long time. I should've kept it and given it to my mom because it was a steal at that price (and it still is even right now). The Acer CB2 is perfect for the average consumers computer needs."}

I purchased a case to add a little bit of sturdiness to it and that helps.  The display is great and the sound is also good for most purposes.  Chromebooks are very different from PCs, so I recommend trying one out before you buy.  For general web surfing and emailing, it's perfect, but there are a lot of things you can't do.

I still have my PC and I always will but this is what I use the majority of the time. I'd use it all the time but I've never gotten the hang of typing on a laptop-style keyboard [yes, I know I can dock a wireless keyboard to it but I have space issues where I use this to study] and to type the simplest thing takes me forever unless I'm in front of a regular keyboard. That's not the fault of the Chromebook. I guess if you are a big gamer or do a lot of Office sort of things then this wouldn't be for you. I use it for study, email, Facebook...all the usual. I leave my Office work at...work.  It's lightening fast and with 100 GB of storage in the Drive...it's all I need."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "This is my experience with my new Acer CB3-111 Chromebook so far. I have used Google for mail, blog and sites, so the Chromebook is not as alien as it might be to those unfamiliar with Googles quirks. I feel that using gmail on line and using Google docs for the first few times is similar to upgrading Microsoft windows. I know what I want to do, but doing it is just a little different than the last version I used. I have had 6 tabs open in the browser and had no sense of the machine slowing down. UTUBE works well. The SD slot does not swallow the entire card as a bigger laptop does, so I understand how others do not like having the card sticking halfway out of the machine, but then I do not roam around with the card in the machine. The flash drive worked just like it would on windows. I downloaded a PDF file and that was handled well. Pictures can now be inserted directly into an email instead of sent as an attachment I prefer inserting them directly into the message. The initial device configuration hung up, but it seemed to be an online glitch so I turned the machine off for 20 seconds and turned it back on and everything was completed right away. I registered the Chromebook on Acers website and as soon as they accepted the serial number the screen changed and there was a link to download the full 40 page user manual, which I highly recommend doing. The manual is available on the Acer site, but I needed to look around for a while to find it before I registered the Chromebook. The keyboard is 10.5 inches across  just shy of the 11 inch one on my 17 Acer laptop, and it works well. I was using the machine off and on for 2 days and leaving it on standby in between usage. I monitored the battery status during that time and I think it did last through about 8.5 hours of use, plus the standby. It recharged from 5% to 100% in less than 1 and a half hours. This machine has no fan, but after hours of use it was still quite cool to touch. The speakers are on the bottom, but have more than enough volume when it is sitting on a table. Most people use headphones anyway as they are better than any laptop speakers. Because I have previously had Google accounts, when I signed in the first time all of my Google bookmarks, and everything else Google started showing up so that saved a lot of grief with transferring files and such. If I completely shut off the Chromebook I need to log back into Google, otherwise, from standby that is not necessary. I can just use the Chromebook as a guest and that does not require any login. I have used this thing day and night  for the last 5 days and have yet to find anything it will not do well. One day I had the Chromebook and my windows laptop side by side during an agonizing tech support session with my web hosting company. The Chromebook had been in use for about 4 hours prior and when I turned the windows laptop on it went through 100% battery in 2.5 hours, but the Chromebook was still running fine on its battery and lasted another hour plus. One thing I learned from the Acer chromebook manual was how to do a right click. It is simple, just tap the trackpad with two fingers for a quick half second. The dialogue box will open with options as it does in Windows machines. If I hold that too long the Chromebook thinks I want to move the screen up or down. I cannot speak much for games beyond a card game I play. My thinking is get a tablet for playing games, they are better with a touch screen. You never lose an email with Google until you choose to dump it. That can be years on just a free 15 gigabyte storage. I opened Google drive and using it with the Chromebook it runs faster than with a windows machine. I do not know why, but I had quit using it with windows because it took so long to up or download. My windows computer takes 2 minutes to come out of sleep mode and be ready to use. It takes almost 4 minutes from a shut down. This Chromebook is ready to work in about 5 seconds. That is big for me because I want to jump on line for just a few seconds at times. I have been using this Chromebook for 1 week now and I have not found anything it will not do. I am sure I will at some point, but not yet. After 1 week I can understand why some people have said when they bought a Chromebook as a secondary or backup unit, they now use it as the primary computer. If you have read this far and know of things windows will do that Chromebook will not, you apparently use windows for things I never have. I think for 90 or more % of users this Acer Chromebook CB3-111-C670 will do everything you want to do. I am dragging this thing all around the house and the WIFI works well for me."}

Aside from the fact that its very handy and easy to carry, the whole thing is not complicated to operate at all! All the basic things my wife needed on a laptop is here. If you buy one right now just don't put too high expectations as it is definitely not like Macbook Air or any other expensive brands.

At first I didn't think it would be practical because you can't install software. I decided to buy it anyways cause the price was too good to be true. I purchased mine at best buy. After getting it I realized I don't even use much software even though my old laptop is packed. There is a application store similar to play store but apps are very limited as of right now but I imagine with more people purchasing chromebooks that there will be a demand to make more apps. Another thing is that windows and apple usually have long start up times but the chromebook fires up in seconds.\n\nPros:\nStartup is very quick\nLightweight\nNo need for virus protection\nEasy to sync everything\n\nCons\nLimited apps\nNo software\nLimited space on laptop itself, but it's on the cloud!!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "I agree with the many overwhelmingly good comments left by owners and thank the authors for helping convince me to purchase my Acer Chromebook 11. It is a great value and exactly what I wanted - a small, light, inexpensive, portable computer to use for the internet and sometimes connect to the hdtv to view video clips and internet content. It is very easy to set up and to use and appears to be well made and designed. I have a Google account and used that to log in. It boots and runs very quickly, especially the network speed, page loads and when switching between windows. The video plays smoothly and the sound is good. I have relatively slow but adequate DSL, so imagine it would run faster with a better connection. It runs faster than my desktop that has a faster CPU and runs linux and windows. I have yet to explore all of the capabilities. There are a few small downsides, such as printing. It is possible to print to a cloud capable printer. I did not expect this to be able to fully replace my desktop but as it meets 95%+ of my computer needs, I am fine with that. I actually like using the mouse pad and can scroll easily with two fingers or move the mouse cursor with one. I do miss not having a delete key when editing. Page up and down buttons would be nice when scrolling too. I have not investigated the Google apps yet.\n\nI highly recommend this and possibly other members of the Chromebook family for many users who mostly use the internet, email, etc and want a small, light simple to use PC. First, note your usage and needs to see if a Chromebook will work for you. I know Chromebooks may not be everyone's solution but may work well for many.\n\nPros:  boot and run speed\n  battery life\n  ease of setup/use\n  size/weight\n  value, features, performance, low purchase price\n  simple, fast Chrome operating system\n  available Google Chrome apps\n  clear display\n  USB ports and memory card slot\n  low chance of viruses/malware\n  no/automatic sw updates\n  no error messages\n  no bloatware\n  solid state hard drive\n  HDMI port for hdtv connection (must set Chromebook to mirror screen)\n\nCons: wifi only - no ethernet port\n  lack of delete and scroll up/down keys\n  won't run MS software such as office\n  no DVD/CD drive\n  not for high power use - gaming, photo editing, etc"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "I cannot complain. Once you get used to the minor keyboard differences and the touch pad, it's on like hot buttered popcorn. I use it to check email/facebook, bank/shop online, and watch Netflix/YouTube. I did notice that if the machine is running multiple tabs in Chrome at once, there is a bit of a lag (i.e. streaming music while chatting on Facebook). For me, it is great! It is silent, really light weight, and loads quickly. I paid $170.00, not too bad. But do shop around...would I recommend this to anyone who is looking to do more than surf the web? Probably not. It's a Chromebook, so it's optimized to run web apps. I am not a gamer, so not sure how it would perform in that arena. I graduated from college like 5 years ago and have never needed to use cloud storage/Google Drive/Google Docs, so I can't say much in that regard. If you do purchase, I hope you like it! If not, return it, and hopefully you find the right machine for you."}

I wanted to try it, so I thought I would go for economy.  I don't know what else a person would want.  It is a compact size, very light, boots in 5 seconds.  Honestly, it really boots in 5 seconds.  So far, it does everything I want it to do.  The speakers are great, and the screen is nice and bright.  I was reading using kindle in the cloud and it was perfect.  I know they make these bigger with bigger processors, etc.  But, I don't know what you would need it for.  I was a little apprehensive and kind of in the bigger is better mindset, but so far this thing is great.  Very inexpensive.

I do not miss the hum of my old laptop's fan at all! The battery seems to last forever. When I use it at home, I use a wireless mouse, external speakers, and a USB keyboard, but it works great on its own as well. I use it primarily for surfing the web and writing in Google Docs.\n\nWhile this is a web-based laptop with limited functionality offline, the only things I've really missed are a Sonos app and the ability to sync to my iPhone.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "I have had three Acer Chromebooks before this one - the C720 model - and they were amazing. Fast, convenient, easy to operate. While this one is still easy to figure, it chokes up, it's slow, it wants to drive me insane. On the C720, I could easily have 20 tabs open with no issues. This sad imitation - three's a crowd. The pages shut down within seconds of not using them, so if you want to, say, listen to music & browse, forget it. If you need a page open for whatever while you do other things, forget it. Pages have to reload when you click on them. Even gmail. Now that is just sad. I missed the return window, so I am just going to wait until I inevitably drop this one (it's a given with my clumsiness, hence this being my 4th CB) & get something else. Not sure if I will go with Acer again. I will say the performance issues are not constant. Sometimes, it's ok. Usually for less than an hour, but that could be due to my less than ambitious browsing/usage."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "Today, the chromebook I ordered from amazon came in. I paid for it with bitcoin through a third-party site. I got it as a backup to my old laptop, which has been struggling of late. I thought it would have a conventional operating system like Windows or Mac, but it really doesn't. You can't install third-party programs, for the most part. While this does mean there are no junkware applications to install at the first start-up, it also means you'll be struggling trying to figure out how to use your favorite program from another computer. Mine was OpenOffice.\n\nThough the laptop itself has a hard drive, with admittedly small storage space, everything on the chromebook runs through google drive. This means you have to use the google chrome application, which google tracks for advertising purposes (and sometimes for turning data over to the NSA). You can only access all your files online through google's servers. Had someone explained that to me while I was trying to make my choice, I would not have bought it. You can redeem two free years of space on google's servers but after that you'll (presumably) have to pay for it. Imagine my surprise at discovering that I would have to pay extra just to access files I worked with on my computer.\n\nThe entire operating system runs through google chrome, which means you have to be online to do just about anything. So you can't take it on a camping trip to the wilderness, you can't take it to the park, or a place with poor reception. You might need to buy a clear stick just to use the computer at various public locations- ie, a portable internet service with a monthly rate. It is especially troublesome if you're like me and you're stuck with an internet plan that isn't very good, one which disconnects regularly.\n\nYou can do absolutely nothing offline with the chromebook. Nothing. That kind of defeats the point of having a laptop in the first place, doesn't it?\n\nI purchased the laptop with a mouse pad installed. There is no right-click function as far as I can see. The chromebook does have right-click menus, but if you bought the cheaper version, you'll be stuck with left-clicking all the time. When you do click on it, it makes a loud \"ga-cha\" sound that might annoy people if you happen to be working in a library. It's certainly annoying enough for me that I put in my USB mouse (which, again, is another expense you might have to incur just to make the chromebook work like a normal laptop).\n\nThere are no function keys (ie, F1, F2, etc). With Windows, I made regular use of Alt + F4. There's no delete key, either, so I can't use Ctrl + Alt + Delete. If there is a task manager, I have yet to find it. I really like the utility of task manager being able to manually shut down pesky programs that doesn't want to close even when you hit the red X button in the program such as Skype.\n\nThere are two USB ports, one for normal USB outlets and another one for...I don't even know what fits in that one. Nothing I have from a wireless mouse, a thumb drive, a USB controller, none of it fits in there. I would have liked two USB drives of the same kind so I can use the mouse and the thumb drive at the same time.\n\nIf you have a problem, chances are someone else has had that problem too. The google forums are littered with people asking questions about how they're supposed to complete a desired action with their chromebook. Most often, the answer is \"you can't do that.\" The chromebook is very much anti-user and anti-choice. It forces you to use what it provides and doesn't let you do much of anything else.\n\nI'm giving a rating of three stars rather than one, which I am very tempted to do. The machine has been built well by Acer. It's small and lightweight. Despite me having somewhat large hands from years of manual labor, I can type on the keyboard fairly easily. I thought the screen would be too small for me, but that doesn't appear to be the case. The battery, when charged at 100%, claims to have around seven hours of life. (It might be more if you're just typing away endlessly without forcing the machine to access the internet.)\n\nThe downside is, I can't figure out how to remove the battery. Buying a spare battery, charging them both, and then working at a place without an electrical outlet has always been my favorite thing to do with a laptop. I like the outdoors. The chromebook, it seems, is going to force me indoors. So, once again, it's making choices for me.\n\nAs bad as Windows 8.1 is- and it's pretty bad- the chomebook is worse. It seems to have been designed by a company who fell in love with their own product and then forgot that other people might not be quite so enamored with everything google. They might eventually figure out that people just don't care about google docs, or that people might not want to have a youtube icon sitting on the taskbar. They give you what they give you, and you have to live with it.\n\nOverall, a disappointment."}

However, I have to say that the whole process was actually an unexpected pleasure.  Not only was the computer left fully functional when I completed the simple system image restore, I learned a valuable task that could come in handy in the future.  For sure, Google made a scary situation as easy to resolve as anything I could have hoped for.\n\nI chose the Acer Chromebook 11 CB3-111-C670 for my wife, based on reviews and knowing accurately what her wants and needs were.  For sure, PRICE was major motivator as well.  Thankfully, she is delighted with the browser-centric functionality of Chrome.  She warmed up to this more-than-adequate information resource that can sit next to her sewing machine as she works through her projects.\n\nThough we both have Windows 'puters, and Android phones/tablets, we got our minds around Google's Chrome in a fraction of the time and effort that any other device had required.  I know that Windows 10 is nearing release, and many tech bloggers are predicting that Microsoft will rule.  Well, maybe so, but we will simply enjoy what we currently have...and root for Google to keep up the good work with Chrome.  Certainly, there is plenty of room for Linux, Chrome and Windows.  They all have finer points to brag about.\n\nAs for Acer's hardware...\n\nWe made a very good choice, that's for sure.  The whole Chrome experience has been made a slam-dunk by Acer, as their product works seamlessly with every one of the default Chrome apps, and everything we've added from the Chrome Store.  The keyboard suits my wife just fine, and the display is perfect now that I've bumped the resolution down to 1024.  The now larger fonts are much easier on her eyes.  A white bluetooth mouse by Samsung (search Amazon for the ASIN number: B00IUXAS6K) rounds out the package.  She loves this little Chromebook, and that definitely scores me some rare, major points!  ;o)"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "This is by far my favorite laptop. I just want to point out some suggested improvements, I hope Acer reads this\n1. Built quality is great, light and sturdy is an excellent combination, but the trackpad feels a little loose and flimsy, which is unfortunate since everything in this laptop feels well made. I wish chromebooks would get rid of the click mechanism in their trackpads and simply go for tap and touch. Clicking is unreliable and unnecessary. The mouse movement on the trackpad is the best I've experienced in any laptop (excluding Apple)\n2. The dimension of the laptop is excellent, BUT it would've been even better if the screen had less bezels, the keyboard and trackpad would be crammed you say? well you could go for a 16:10 ratio, then you would have more space for the track-pad and keyboard in a smaller device.\n3. Again the 16:9 ratio is not so good for small screens, anything below 12 inches should be at least 16:10\n4. Resolution is decent enough, at 135 ppi the screen is pretty crisp, BUT the standard TFT panel is just too outdated and looks washed out, I know it is a more efficient technology, but i wouldn't mind losing an hour of battery life for a superior screen. I have a 100 ppi IPS panel that I use for my desktop and it looks A LOT better, all in all I believe a 1280x800 IPS 12 inch screen would've been a better screen for this device even if that were only 125 ppi.\n\nAll in all one AMAZING laptop, I wish Acer would build a product that is even smaller and lighter. Highly recommended.\n\n********\n\nUpdate: I got a Toshiba Chromebook 2 and gave this device to my baby sister. Now I'm using this device to update this review, and noticed just how awful the screen really is. Wow, it really really sucks. I'm really glad to see that Acer has updated the screen on the new version to IPS, because this is a serious flaw in the older version. I still think this device has tons of potential and I hope Acer addresses some of the well known let downs in the older version."}

I bought this Chromebook for my 8yr old son who uses Chromebooks in school. He tore off the wrapping paper and was so excited he couldn't even get any words out. Unadulterated joy on an 8yr old's face is priceless.  He immediately opened it and started the Chromebook like he had done at school. Unfortunately, while the Chromebook would connect to our home wireless network, it wouldn't connect to the internet. It gave various errors including \"Chromebook is unable to connect to the Internet using Centurylink1234\" and ERR_NOT_ENROLLED. I spent the next hour using my other computer to search the internet to troubleshoot and fix the problem, to no avail. I did learn that this is a common problem, but none of the suggested fixes worked. Heart-breaking disappointment on a 8yr old's face is painful.\n\nFYI-All of our other devices could connect to the internet on our home network except the Chromebook. I even tried to connect the Chromebook via Bluetooth using my iPhone, but of course I now know that Apple doesn't support Chromebook. Really you two Goliaths - you'd make so much MORE money if you cooperated.\n\nThe next morning I took the Chromebook to work and tried the networks there, also to no avail. Same errors. So, I finally decided to ask the Google support site at: https://support.google.com/chromebook/contact/email_ninja. Curiously, as soon as I typed in the Chromebook's serial number at that helpsite, the Chromebook started working. Hmmm."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "This is HANDS DOWN the worst technological buy I have ever made.\n\nIt was strange enough to me to not have internal storage and no place to save my files besides Google Drive.... I dislike drive-only storage for obvious reasons: security, accessibility, etc. I can only access my files when I have internet access, instead of being able to view them anytime because they are saved to the disk.\n\nNow, that wouldn't be an issue if wifi were always available. But I have had numerous wifi issues with this computer: not finding the network, timing out, losing connectivity. THAT RENDERS THE COMPUTER USELESS. And it's not a wifi problem, as iPhones, iPads, and Android devices have no problem connecting to (and staying on) these same networks.\n\nFurthermore, there are all kinds of Google quirks that you can not get rid of/have no control of. One of my biggest complaints along these lines is that browser windows refresh every five minutes or so - sometimes more frequently. That would be nice, if it were something I needed to refresh. But refreshing Wordpress has made me lose blog drafts. Refreshing Picmonkey has made me lose partially-edited pictures. Refreshing my Drive means I have to return every couple minutes to RECOPY pictures that I just told it to upload. And refreshing Pandora constantly causes errors that keep the music from playing - which always wakes my napping infant.\n\nThis computer is also incompatible with many functionalities I am accustomed to, most namely SKYPE. They have their own video chatting service (good for you, Google, but no one has that).\n\nFinally - and probably most obnoxiously - apps are quitting CONSTANTLY. You'd think that a computer with no internal storage would run quickly and efficiently because it has nothing else to do, but I can't run Chrome & Camera at the same time without losing both. Don't even get me started on trying to play music and do anything, or upload something while even browsing the internet.\n\nIn other words, this computer makes my life FAR more difficult than it aids in any way. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR and save for a macbook air or another similarly small computer that will actually function for you."}

The problem router was a Belkin, I replaced the Belkin with an Almond router and all is good****\n\nIt is everything it is advertised to be......EXCEPT....when I can't access gmail or google search.  Yes...you read that correct.  For some reason and it is often enough to be annoying.  I cannot access my gmail account or google search from my GOOGLE chromebook.  When this happens it is VERY annoying.\n\nThe entire reason I purchased this chromebook was to have a fast, instant start-up internet device for those times when I'm late for my daughter's soccer game I need to quickly look up wthe location of the field, or some other last second need to access information on line where a keyboard is helpful.  4 out of 5 time (probably 19 out of 20 times really)  it works great.  But every now and then I click on the gmail \"app\" button (essentially a button for a hyperlink to gmail) and the the loading bar for gmail only goes part way across and get's stuck!!  I can access other websites in these moments, so I know my internet is working, but I cannot access gmail or google search.  If I wait eventually I get an error message that says \"the app is unavailable\".  It offers to \"provide more information\" on the error, but if I click the link for more information bu it takes me to a blank browser window with \"about:blank\" in the address bar.\n\nAnd it has something to do with the chromebook itself and how it interacts with the google servers because I've done many tests when this occurs where I run and grab my kindle fire and can easily access my gmail and google search while I confirm they are still unreachable on the chromebook.  I've double and triple checked that my chromebook is \"stuck\" while my kindle can access these \"apps\".  Strange huh?  Yes...and very very frustrating.\n\nThis only happens 1 out of 5 times...OK probably much less but it is so frustrating it feels like 1 in 5 times.  When it is working it is awesome.  It is WAY faster on-line than my old netbook and is just as fast if not faster than my wife's Mac she is provided by her work.  It boots up in a millisecond and gives me everything I need to meet 99% of my home computing needs in a very lightweight quality-feeling device.  Easily 5 stars if I didn't experience this bug.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "This is an amazing product.  This is my second chromebook and an all around beast.  I am going to break down this review first for people that have already used chromebooks in the past, and what makes this model special, and then break down why chrome is so awesome to begin with.\n\nThis is the ideal model for me.  It is by far the cheapest that is out out there, and also the best for what I am looking for.  I started using Acer web books with the Aspire 1, and absolutely loved having it to not have to lug around a large laptop for when I needed to get online or work on something that didn't need a lot processing power for.  It stayed my go to for school work or to lug around when I didn't want to carry something heavy.  Then my go to Macbook Pro died.  The Aspire would not pull the load of such an expensive piece of hardware, and I needed a replacement, but didn't have the money to get another one.  I had been reading about Chrome and that it replaced programs with online apps.  I decided to take the plunge, and quickly realized that it was an lifestyle to completely convert to Google.  While I will admit that not everything on the Google network is completely where it needs to be, I will say that being an early adopter, that it gets better all the time, and is the most complete and the thriftiest of the other options, but more on that in a moment.  In terms of what you are getting from Chrome, that doesn't really change from platform to platform.  What you are getting with this version of Chrome, at least compared to the the Acer 710 (The first iteration of Acer Chromebook) is a much sturdier frame.  This is the biggest improvement overall to me, and is even much better than the 720 version.  You are also getting a 2.16 GHZ processor which is a decent size upgrade in processing power, though you are still dealing with 2 GB in Ram and 16 GB solid state drive.  I know this is getting a little bit ahead of myself, but I have read a lot of reviews and comments about the lack of physical memory on this, and how it prevents people from saving files.  If that is how you feel, then you are doing it wrong.  The idea of chrome is to outsource most of the processes to Google, so that very little has to run from your unit.  You get 100 GB cloud drive for free with purchase, that can be accessed anywhere.  I spilled water on my old 710, and thanks to the way that Google works, as soon as I signed into my new computer, not are all my files there and intact, but all of my preference and third party passwords saved on my Google profile.  It was just like signing into my old computer, only this one runs much faster, and has a much better battery life.  It went from 2 hrs, to between 6 and 8 depending on what it is that you are doing.  Another big improvement is the speakers, which are still located on the bottom of the computer, but don't get as distorted when placed on your lap or cloth surface as the older models.  Still not peak sound performance, but much better than before.\n\nNow to the bad.  This first is a minor gripe that goes on preference, but I don't like the keys as much.  My girlfriend has the same model and prefers them to the 710, but that was an immediate selling point for me.  They are still the individually placed keys, similar to apple, but they feel, to me, as though they are slightly more raised, making me lift my fingers ever so slightly more, slowing down my typing.  I wouldn't even really complain, as they are much more springy and feel free to go to a store and try it out yourself.  Now for the unforgivable.  The delete key has been replaced by a power button that is actually part of the keyboard.  I have no idea why this was important for google, as it is a part of all their newer chromebooks, but it really has no function as the notebook powers itself on when you open it automatically, meaning that I have only used the power button maybe twice, and a delete key is just handy for typing and such.  I guessing they were trying to immolate Apple?  The mouse pad is much less responsive, and while better than anything I have found for Windows, it just has the slightest of delays and feels like it just isn't as tight as the older models.  It isn't bad if you don't have the previous model, which was better than my old Apple mouse pad, to compare it to.  The SD card slot no longer completely accepts the card, leaving half the card sticking out.  I have caught cords on similar set ups and broken the SD card off accidentally in the past (with my old Mac) so while this is a feature carried over from the 720, I really wish that they would go back.  Also the 710 had an additional USB port and a monitor hook up.  I also enjoyed the fact that the old power cord had the option to change the plug out so that you could change for what country you were in.  This cord is longer though so it is minor if you intend to stay in the U.S. The biggest annoyance for me was the fact that the RAM could not be upgraded.  The Acer 13 and 15, so named for the size of their screens, both have the option for a 4 GB RAM and 32 GB solid state Drive.  One of the purposes for having a smaller laptop is that I don't have to carry bulky equipment, and while I don't really feel the lag from the lack of RAM now, I also know that this model is not going to age as long, which is really quite a shame considering how much effort you can tell they put into creating a sturdier frame for the computer, that is the best of all the Chromebooks.  It is most infuriating when you think that the older, and slower 720 only had 4 GB of RAM, and it isn't even a choice here.  My last gripe is the lack of choice in color, and I don't really like white, though it grows on you.\n\nNow for Chrome.  Unlike Windows and Apple, this is not made to run \"programs\"  This means that if you have to download a program onto your PC, this is not for you.  On the plus side, this means that it does not have a heavy operating load and is lightning fast on the internet, which is what it was made for.  Now here is where people seem to be betting confused about how this product was intended to be used, because I hear a lot of people advise that chromebooks are great for people who only want to check email and social networking on.  While this is true, and if that is all that you do online, then this is not only the cheapest and best option to do so, there is really nothing that you can do on any computer that can not be done here.  That does not mean that it can run any program, but that Google has a work around to do any task.  If you want to write documents, then you are going to have to work on Google Docs.  You can still read a Word Doc, or just about any other kind of document (The hands down best feature about Chrome is that it can open and play just about any format for just about anything, without the hassle of updates that you are responsible for) but if you are going to write a document, you will need to write it on Google and have it convert to Word or PDF.  An extra step, but what I am quickly realizing is that Google word is just all around better, not to mention that it is sharable so that many people can be working on it in real time.  Sure, skype doesn't work, but Google Hangouts does the same thing.  I work in media, so one of the biggest things for me was video editing.  There are online editors that work in a cloud, so while I have to pay a subscription, it is actually much cheaper and I don't have to update models every time a company comes out with something new.\n\nThis is a lifestyle, and you really have to realize that if you are going to convert completely to Google, that there are a couple of old ways of thinking about computers that you are just going to have to let go and come to terms with the fact that this is a faster, cheaper, and more updated way to use a computer.  The more people who get on board, the better all of these work arounds and apps are going to be, and the idea of paying hundreds of dollars every year or couple of years for software is a thing of the past.  Trust me, you won't be disappointed."}

I use a high-powered Dell laptop for work (currently, IT Instructional System Designer), we own an iMac, MacBook Air, Windows laptop, and iPad 2 for personal use. I use the Chromebook more than all our personal computers combined. I love the iPad, but prefer a real keyboard (yes I have an external iPad keyboard as well), and since buying the Chromebook, I can go weeks without using the iPad.\n\nFeature wise, the screen is perfectly fine, clear, decent colors. The keyboard is much better than I expected. Performance wise, I have no complaints. It boots in seconds. I can have 10 web browser tabs open with little or no performance issues. I will say that some sites affect the chromebook in a negative way, but I have not isolated what causes them to run slowly.\n\nThe sound is surprisingly good, has just the right ports for USB, HDMI, etc. For $200 this is a steal.\n\nOf course being a traditional user, I would like more local apps, but hey, I use it 98% of the time at home, so that it is not an issue. Regarding apps, I love Google Docs, LucidChart, Chrome, a few more. I can't think of one game I thought was worth keeping. Since a portion of my free time is recording music, it would be great if it did that, but it doesn't and that is fine. I do use it however, to display the music I am playing.\n\nBottom line, it is a great web device for Google searches, email, Facebook, BleacherReport, and so forth. It is great for folks like me who like Google Docs. And that is about 90% of my personal use for a computer. So again, for $200, it is a no brainer steal!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "I generally don't seem to do anything on the computer without being connected to the net. So, I toyed with the idea of using a Chromebook for the past couple of years but never did anything about it. I had switched to an Ubuntu Linux from Windows years ago for the advantage of a quick boot and practically everything that Windows provides as a desktop.\nWhen I saw that a Chromebook is available for $200, I bought this one as the specifications suggested that it can do everything I needed except for syncing my Fitbit device. It boots blazingly fast and the performance is excellent. I travel a lot and so it is ideal for me because it is really lightweight. I had been using OpenDNS for better security as I connect a lot through public Wifi hotspots. The Chromebook comes with a feature to just click on a radio button to choose Google's secure DNS. So, people who don't have an OpenDNS account can just use this feature.\n\nAs for a full desktop, it is easy to install Ubuntu if one wants it. I installed one on mine but found that I never switched over to it and so uninstalled it subsequently. The display is pretty good for watching Netflix streaming videos.\n\nThose who are quite used to using Windows and related software may find some irritants like some of their devices like a scanner or printer not having a driver for ChromeOS. But there are alternatives available in the ChromeOS ecosystem to get the job done. Those who have done everything through the Google ecosystem, keeping everything on its Cloud, would find it a breeze to switch to the Chromebook."}

He doesn't yell OK GOOGLE, so I don't understand. Maybe someone can tell me whats going on? it is not muted  (yet doesn't work) on google hang out ,so the microphone is broken. Has anyone else had this type of problem? I must say Amazon has been great about exchanging it no problems at all, and if this happens to the new one i will get a refund and get the C720. (or the acer 13 inch we have that one as well) If not for this issue It would receive 5 stars.\nIt is fast ,light ,& the battery life is fantastic!! I've never has any issues connecting to internet or it holding a charge. as far as looks we bought a shell and its now a Red chromebook that all my sons friends end up using instead of their notebooks when over..The backspace key and power key are WAY too close together and ive accidently turned off my work a few times,also on this model the power cord inserts in the back of the machine, something Ive had on an acer LapTop that ended up breaking the charger.it would be fantastic if it had a forward (or is it rear? on the lid) facing camera, however we have made it work and taken home pictures all the time. I know this isn't a professional review, I didn't write anything down first for that I apologize. I need to set this back to factory now, as the new one is going to be here today. however, I'll be checking back if anyone has answers to the microphone issue, it does NOT appear t be a known \"issue\" like everyone who has any problem says theirs is..lol.

It's tough (I've dropped mine on ceramic tile floors more than I can count) and speedy and the battery time is loooong. This is my 2nd Chromebook - first one lasted 3 years and finally the battery just wouldn't take a charge anymore. However - replacing a complete computer every 3 years for under $200 is a bargain any way you look at it. There are plenty of apps, too. Personally, I prefer Wrd and Excel to the Google versions, but there's an app for that, too.\n\nMy only complaint - on this version they took away the 'delete' key. So there's an extra step required if one wants to delete something, one has to use the backspace key. Other than that, I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a lot of computing dynamite in a tiny, reasonably priced package. And if Chrombook builders read this, put the darned 'delete' key on the next one! Am mystified as to why they took it off."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "This Chromebook is fantastic, hardly feels like an entry-level model.  Its fast, fully functional, very light and portable, battery lasts longer than the manufacturer's estimated time, and is very easy to use.\n\nBy way of some background, before the details: I'm a long time Apple user (as in, from the original Macintosh to current).  I've been accused of being an Apple \"fan-boy,\" though I like to think I'm a bit more objective than that.  I have a great little Macbook Air as my work computer and my personal home computer is an iPad.  No complaints whatsoever.\n\nThe college I work for uses Google Apps, I've used Gmail/Googel Docs personally for a long time, and even the two foundations I serve on have Google Apps environments.  So when I decided I wanted a low-cost laptop for occasional personal use a Chromebook seemed like it would be the perfect solution.  The first two I was able to use, both current models and both more expensive than this Acer, were awful.  They felt inexplicably slow for a computer that was primarily running a web browser for an OS. Painfully slow.  I didn't last a full week with either of them, and was disappointed.  I wanted to like the Chromebook solution, but those first two experiences almost made me give up.\n\nThen I came across a review of this Acer 11, saw all the (mostly) positive reviews, and the very low price and decided to give it another shot.  This time around, it worked beautifully.\n\nThe Chromebook itself is nicely made.  It is plastic, and certainly feels less significant than my Macbook Air.  The lip formed by the keyboard/trackpad plate, where it overlaps the molded bottom/sides shell, has a tellingly plastic feel to it in particular.  But despite that first impression, it is well made and fitted.  It doesn't feel flimsy and the screen/lid is solid enough that I haven't ever worried about it flexing and breaking.\n\nThe keyboard is perfect.  The keys have just the right amount of travel and sensitivity.  Really, they feel almost identical to the Macbook Air keys.  The track is also very good, though a tad less smooth than the Air's.  Even so, I haven't had any issues using it or switching back and forth between the two laptops.  For a Macbook user, this keyboard and trackpad will feel very familiar and comfortable.\n\nBattery life is very solid, and I routinely get more time out of it than is promised.  The screen is bright enough, resolution is fine, and the matte finish helps with glare.  It isn't anything as good as a retina caliber display, but quite good enough for regular use.  I also like that the screen can be tipped back until almost parallel with the keyboard.  This really helps when finding just the right viewing angle, especially when moving from sitting to standing.\n\nThe Chrome OS is the other half of the Chromebook equation.  As others have noted, it is an operating system built around Google's Chrome web browser and their suite of online (\"cloud-based\") tools.  You need a Google/Gmail account to run it, so if you don't already have one you will be prompted to create one when you first boot up.  Simply log in with your Gmail account and your Google apps universe is there waiting for you.  There is almost nothing to configure and almost nothing to \"install.\"\n\nGoogle Apps comes with a very good suite of office apps and they have continued to evolve to a point where they are full-featured and very compatible with MS Office apps.  For those who have Office 365, you can install Word, Excel, Powerpoint and use them directly, but given the compatibility between Google Apps and Office (Google Apps can now edit MS Office files directly) I'd suggest giving them a try before shelling out for Office 365.  Check out the Chrome Store to see all of the apps, extensions, and utilities available.  Anything that is Web-based is, of course, just as functional on a Chromebook as any other computer, which means I can use the iCloud beta site to run Pages, Numbers, and Keynote as well.  For most folks, and especially for personal use, the Chromebook is a very viable option.\n\nI really have no complaints with this little inexpensive laptop.  This is a very different story than you would see if you read the review I left of my last Chromebook.\n\nSummary: longtime Apple user, still very much an Apple user, and totally happy with this Chromebook."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "Without getting into what a chromebook is or isn't, I will say that this thing is one incredibly good deal for a portable computer regardless of O.S., especially when you find it on sale (meaning under $199 as of April 2015). I got mine for $129 (a ridiculous deal). It is lightweight, reasonably sturdy (you can't expect it to be on par with something like a Macbook or Pixel quality wise at 1/4 to 1/6 of the price), and has an above average (for lower price points) keyboard and trackpad. The processor isn't the quickest in the world, but it is more than enough to easily handle about half a dozen tabs open at a time, even when one of them is streaming video at 720p (no need to stream 1080 since the screen is only 720). The screen is not great overall, but as good or better than what you find on budget machines (by budget I mean $399 and under). The 2 GB ram is not bad at all considering it runs Chrome OS which is much better at running with lower specs. Don't be afraid of the 16 GB drive because you don't save much on there anyway, and it has an SD slot.\n\nI ran this side by side with my wife's Windows 8.1 Toshiba laptop with an Intel core i3 and 4 GB ram, and it absolutely smoked it. Whether you had just 1 tab open or a dozen, it was better every time. It slows a bit if you throw too much at it, but the Windows machine slowed to a crawl in those situations. For all the people that say \"you can't run Photoshop or edit video or play games on it like you can a Windows laptop\" I have two things to say about it: 1. Are you likely to do those things anyway? Many people say that, but then they use their machines exclusively for web content, email, and basic word processing. 2. Just because you CAN do those things on a cheap Windows machine doesn't mean you will. Sure I COULD do video editing on my wife's laptop, but it would be so painfully slow that I would give up. And games.... well I have done World of Warcraft on my wife's laptop and got framerates in the 15 fps area on low video setting so sure I COULD technically play the game, but really it is not worth it.\n\nBattery life is insane. I like running the battery down to zero before charging, and with regular use this thing doesn't go to zero for 2 or 3 days. It probably gets 7 or so hours of video streaming, and up to 11 or so hours of web browsing or typing. It does all this silently too as there is no need for a fan and there is no spinning hard drive. No moving parts also means less to break. It has eMMC instead of a solid state drive (eMMC is basically an SD card soldered on the motherboard). This is a bit slower than an SSD, but not significantly. In theory it last less than an SSD but at under $200, how long does this thing have to work to be worth the money? I wouldn't feel bad at all if this thing worked for a year or so and than I had to replace it. If I went out and bought a new $1400 Macbook right now, it would be obsolete in 2-3 years anyway, that is $500-700 per year of use.\n\nThe only negatives I have about this thing are the fact that it isn't upgradeable (RAM, processor, and storage soldered on the motherboard) and the SD card sticks out the side of the slot. The first part isn't an issue because it works great right now, and at that price I don't mind dumping after a year or two which is when I'd be looking to upgrade anyway. The second is only a problem if you want to stick it in a form-fitting case, but you can always remove the card when not in use. Is this the greatest laptop on Earth? Not by a longshot, but if you want something easily portable to do your web-browsing, email, Facebook, media consumption, and a little bit of work, and you don't want to break the bank, this more than fits the bill. If you absolutely need to run Windows software, or edit video, or play high graphics games, look elsewhere, but know that you aren't going to get that from a comparably priced Windows laptop, you'll be spending at least twice as much (4 times as much for Apple) for this type of performance."}

(Note: The Lightning Deal did not register on the price-tracking website Camel3.)\n\nI have a workhorse laptop that is heavier and has all my valuable data. I was looking for a cheap, light second laptop for travel and coffee shops. Few points:\n\n- It's strange that the two speakers are on the bottom of the unit. I'm no expert on acoustics but the sound seems to be needlessly muffled. When I want to listen to music from across the room I need to prop it on its side to get the full sound.\n\n- The large (~1\") bezel won't win any design awards. This is largely subjective, but while I don't think anyone would characterize it as sleek, I also don't think it's ugly. It's just kind of plain.\n\n- Gets a little warm when watching video, but overall it stays cool.\n\n- The screen is probably the biggest drawback. It's not nearly as bright or clear as some of the latest laptops. I guess this is where they really save costs, since it's the same screen technology as my old Thinkpad from 1999. (See below for more on the screen)\n\n- It's nice not worrying about OS upgrades and malware! No bloatware either.\n\n- I've used one of the free Gogo in-flight Internet passes. As soon as I connected to the Gogo network I was prompted to click a box to check for free access. After that I was prompted to enter a Captcha-type code. Then I was able to use the Internet. Pretty painless.\n\nThe worst part so far has been an unpleasant experience with customer service. After less than one month of ownership I turned the unit on to find bizarre screen malfunction - a few square inches of screen real estate in the top left mysteriously turned a dead gray. Acer customer service acknowledged on the phone that this was a \"known issue.\" They paid for return shipping, but not a return box. So far so good. Then I received a call that they determined the malfunction was my fault and that I needed to pay $100 for a new screen. I went back and forth with the agent arguing that I did nothing to cause this issue. I also explained that the first agent admitted that this was a known issue and that I've read online of similar defects with the screen. After dropping the phrase \"class action lawsuit,\" I was put on hold for a few minutes. She then agreed to fix it at Acer's expense. I'm happy Acer did the right thing in the end, but it took an unpleasant battle."}

Battery life is great, lasts me about 8 hours, usually doing my web based homework on line, speakers are surprisingly great for the price, no it won't be the best but again, for the price you cant complain.\n\nnow lets talk about the display.. again not the best display, but good enough for web usage. so basically this is for the people who just need to be checking facebook or go shopping online, things along that line, you will not be able to upgrade it in any way shape or form.

Set up was easy - except for connecting to our wifi. I kept getting one of two error messages, and since it was on both computers, I figured we didn't just have a defective one.  I decided to reboot our router, and then they connected just fine, until the next day - when we'd have to reboot the router again. I tried different settings on the router, searched the Web for software updates for my router, and then called in my brother who is an IT guru (although Chromebooks are not his area of expertise.) I was stuck with the rebooting workaround. I decided that I needed to find a new router, but wasn't sure what to look for because I didn't know exactly what the problem was with the one I had (all of our other devices connect just fine.) I was shopping for something else when I happened upon a travel router ( http://www.amazon.com/TP-LINK-TL-WR702N-Wireless-Repeater-150Mpbs/dp/B007PTCFFW/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1427829301&sr=8-2&keywords=travel+router ) and figured that for under twenty bucks, I'd give it a try and if it didn't work for this then I'd find another use for it. I connected it to my main router, set up a new network, and connected the Chromebooks to the network. Voila - no more wifi connection issues!

I don't know whats wrong with it but it has been doing it since the day i got this thing out of the box. It just shuts right off. Ive read other reviews of people with the same problem and on the ACER support website the Technicians claim they don't know why the computer does that. After it reboots back up ( in like 5 seconds literally) it of course asks do i want to reopen the pages that were suddenly close. Most times everything is not reloaded and opened. Most of my work gets lost..\n Another downfall to this computer is that it is a GOOGLE CHROME BOOK. That means everything on this computer is based on GOOGLE. The start button looks exactly like the apps button on google that would display all the apps like  Google Drive and Good Docx and Google slides and hangouts. Everything on this computer is based on google and that means you cant download things that don't coincide with google. like SKYPE and SPOTIFY and even Microsoft Works , everything has to be downloaded from the chrome store....

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "It is actually a pretty good machine.  I'd say better than the 4 starts I gave it here.  The issues I have are very minor.  It doesn't have a delete button though it does have a backspace that does the same job but not exactly the same.  Also, the backspace button you can't just keep it pressed and have it delete and you literally have to keep pressing and releasing it to delete something.  Anyway, you get the idea, I am bringing this issue up simply because I have nothing negative to say about this.\n\nIt is very easy to use.  The price for the machine was good (it was on sale for $160 or $170).  The other accompanying deals were fine (cloud space, access to the internet in flights etc.).\n\nIf you are looking for a machine to browse the internet and you are looking for mobility, it takes care of those needs.  My wife has to have a keyboard so this works just fine.  I'd consider buying another one if the price is right."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "Remember netbooks? Those small, cheap under-powered little computers have grown up and this little Acer Chromebook is a prime example of how the concept of small, inexpensive laptops designed for web-browsing, and light computing has evolved. Google has pretty much doubled down on the concept a few years ago by turning its Chrome browser into an operating system.\n\nBut theory is one thing and practice is another. After all, even though web browsing is considered light computing, install a few extensions, open a few dozen tabs (and modern web pages are so laden with crap like Javascript), and you can easily bring a \"real\" computer to its knees. And this Acer Chromebook is no different. Having said that, it was made to browse the web first and foremost, and it is no more bogged down by heavy web use than any other mid-range laptop.\n\nI have about thirty extensions and tend to keep about eight to twelve tabs open at all times. (Basically I have GMail, Facebook, and Tumbler, plus Feedly and a couple of other web sites open at all times.) After a few hours of jumping back and forth between a lot of different pages this computer does slow down. But that will happen to most low-end and mid-range computers. And this is where the Chromebook's stripped down OS and Solid State Drive shine. This machine boots up in less than ten seconds. So if it becomes bogged down, I just restart it. I don't have to close any of my browser pages. I just click on the shutdown button and the Chromebook shuts itself down gracefully, restarts, let's me log back in and reopens my browser tabs; all in about ten seconds. By comparison, even the most powerful desktop computer will usually take about thirty seconds to a minute to start up and you have to reopen your web browser and wait for it to start separately. Even when restoring from sleep mode, many \"real\" computers will usually take as long or even longer than this Chromebook does to boot up. That is a huge advantage.\n\nBattery life is excellent. Acer claims an 8.5 hour battery life. In my experience, it might be a little less but it is still good enough that battery life is simply not an issue for me on this machine.\n\nPros: Very light, great screen, good comfortable keyboard. Fast boot times. Great battery life. Extremely inexpensive, this machines normally retails for $200 and I bought mine when it was for sale for just $160.\nCons: Not a traditional computer. All apps run inside the web browser.\n\nThe bottom line is this: If you're a hardcore gamer or a Photoshop addict, this is not the machine for you. But if your computing life revolves around the web, this computer is perfect."}

I found it at an excellent price and so bought it to serve as a \"supplemental\" computer for our household.  We have another laptop which runs Windows OS.  The Chromebook will be used for checking email, surfing the web, creating \"basic\" documents (word processing and spreadsheets), and streaming an occasional movie. I am also taking a class so may try taking it to class with me and taking computer notes.  It is fabulous for these purposes.  Operation seems plenty fast for these needs.  It is very easy to use and extremely lightweight.  I already had a google/gmail account so ... just open it up and start using ... which is a big plus.  I love that it is instantly on when I open it up.  The battery life is great.  I ran it almost all day one time and was shocked to look for the cord and find that it was not plugged in.  I sought out an Acer product because I have been very happy with the other Acer computer I own.  We are proficient users of computer/technology products but not \"techies.\"  The limitations I have some concerns about:  1) limited on-device data storage - I am hoping that with the \"cloud\" and another computer at home, this will be a non-issue.  I think I will have to live with this limitation for a while to be sure.  and 2) Printing limitations - we do not have a wifi printer at present.  I am hoping that this will not be a problem given that we have another computer we can use for printing - but it is a concern.  Because of these + the inability to run a few more specialized pieces of software we need, I would not yet be ready to commit to being a Chromebook-only household but as a supplementary device for mostly web-based applications, it is an excellent, cost effective choice."}

And I have to say, I think it's one of the best purchases I've made in a while.\n\nI'm a freelance web designer and developer, and often have to meet with clients in their places of business. Where a lot of what I do at meetings (display my portfolio, teach clients how to use control panels, etc.) is done online, this is perfect. Smaller than my laptop, it fits in my bags easily, and the battery life is fantastic - I can easily get 7-8 hours on a single charge. While ChromeOS isn't really suited to development, you can easily dual-boot Linux or use a cloud IDE.\n\nAs far as the hardware goes; I'm impressed. The plastic doesn't feel overly cheap. The keyboard is spaced-out nicely and easy to type on. The touchpad is smooth and responsive, and the speakers are great - better than the ones on my other laptop. My only qualm is that the matte screen can be hard to read if you have a bad glare.\n\nOkay - it does bother me a little that it doesn't have a Delete key. Mostly because I use it a lot when I'm coding. The average, everyday user isn't likely to miss it.\n\nAll things considered, I'd definitely recommend this to a friend. It's light, speedy, and portable, runs well, and has a myriad of uses, from checking your email or Facebook to running Linux and putting it to work."}

She had an older Asus netbook with 1 gig of RAM running a Windows 7 starting pack.  It was very sluggish, constantly updating Windows, and had a lot of software she never used.  I wiped the operating system and loaded it with Ubuntu OS and it worked really well as a stripped down computer just for web browsing.  That was, until a whole cup of water was dumped on it!  :-(  When looking for a replacement I considered an Android tablet, but she really wanted a keyboard.  I considered getting the Tablet and adding a bluetooth keyboard, but after looking int Chromebooks I realized it is really what she was looking for.  A laptop feel with keyboard, but mainly geared towards web browsing WITHOUT Microsoft Windows OS.  If all you are looking for is a device for web browsing that includes a keyboard, this is the perfect choice.  She has had it for about a month now and is very pleased.  I never get the questions \"Do I make this update?\" or \"Why is it taking so long to open this web page?\"  It boots up extremely fast, battery life has been really good, and it is very light weight with a good screen size.  When I purchased it, it was on sale for $150.  I don't think I could have done any better getting what I wanted for that price.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "I had owned a Samsung Chromebook a few years back. One of the first Samsung models that included their own chip in it. I liked it quite a lot. It wasn't fast, and the screen wasn't that great, but you turned it on and it did what I needed it to do: browse the web. But all good things come to an end and in this case a rather brutal end. I stepped on it. I decided at that point to go the iPad way of doing things, but over time realized that I actually preferred the practicality of a Chromebook as a secondary device for myself and my wife.\n\nI already have a Macbook Pro I use for school, and every day computing. And there lies the problem for me: I can't stand the screen on the Acer. It's almost exactly the same as the Samsung Chromebook from years past. I've been sitting here for months using a retina display Macbook and to then switch over to the Chromebook for basic web browsing tasks is too brutal on my spoiled eyes. For this reason I'm swapping it out for the Toshiba Chromebook 2 1080p model. Yes, that model is $130 more so it's not a completely even swap here, i'm paying more for something a little better. For this reason alone I can't fault a $200 machine that is adequately capable.\n\nSome Things I enjoyed about this machine:\n\nZippier than my old Samsung, and overall satisfied with the performance. It's not buttery smooth, but I never really felt bogged down when switching between tabs or websites.\n\nBattery life is good. 8 - 10 hours\n\nSeems to run cool. Heavy flash videos didn't heat up the machine that I could tell.\n\n2GB of ram still seems more than sufficient for Chrome OS\n\nTrackpad was kinda of lousy, but the keyboard was surprisingly good.\n..\nThat's really it for me. If you're ok with washed out screens, for $200 this is a capable machine for doing web related tasks."}

Secondly I travel frequently and wanted something Lightweight as opposed to bringing my laptop with me.  I tried the Macbook Air, but having never been a Mac user, I could not grasp it.

It's a joy not waiting for it to boot up like I did with my laptop (about 6 seconds now). No more opening task manager to close unneeded software, no uninstalling more software to make it speed up, etc. My phone is an Android and everything is synced through my Google account, so I get the same notifications on my Chromebook if I don't have my phone near me. Not only is the Chromebook \"light\" software-wise (Chrome OS is simple to use), it is physically as well. I take it with me to my part-time job at a college for student help and it's wonderful not getting locked screens, or waiting an eternity for a website to load.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "four stars mostly because i am just used to regular laptops with a few more bells and whistles and the greater options of windows system settings compared to chromebook OS.  however, for what i use this for it is mostly great.\n\none thing i did not think to look at, with the specs: this device has no ethernet port, and you must have a live internet connection in order to get the chromebook up and running the first time you turn it on.  So you either have to have an available wifi, or a modem/router that will allow you to connect via USB.\n\nThe requisite USB cord does NOT come with the chromebook, which was a problem for me, since i was installing new internet service at my home and needed a computer to set up the wifi!  Luckily TWC sent me a modem instead of a router, and I had already scheduled a tech to come out and exchange it for a router, and he was kind enough to also hook up my wifi.  Once that was taken care of, getting the chromebook running was very easy.\n\nI'm also not crazy about the fact that everything the chromebook does is through the chrome web browser.  I do like chrome, I'm just used to having \"applications\".  Considering that I travel frequently and don't always have access to the internet, not being able to store files locally (at least not easily) is a bit of a hindrance, but I suppose that's part of the learning curve.  I am concerned about being able to work with documents, music and videos when I can't connect.  Granted the hard drive is pretty small (although I can expand it with a flash later) and I wouldn't want to store a lot locally, however, i was able to fit 6-7 movies and quite a bit of music on my old iphone, which wasn't any larger memory-wise.\n\nProbably my biggest issue with all of this, is that there is no chrome app for Amazon Instant Video.  The android app does not work on chromebook.  I can stream videos from the amazon website, but again if i don't have an internet connection available, that's about 20 movies and several seasons of TV shows I can't get to.  needless to say, I'm very disappointed in Amazon for not making their app available on the chromebook.  I'm slowly working around this by purchasing movie from Google Play but clearly they are in competition, and I find that annoying on both their parts.  I enjoy using digital content and now I really don't want to buy from either of them.  Considering movies and music make up more than half my computer use, this was a huge disappointment.  So this chromebook is NOT A LAPTOP REPLACEMENT.\n\nAnother oddity is that the chromebook does not have a delete button.  Not a huge problem, but a little wierd for me.  Otherwise I like the keyboard.\n\nOkay so those are my main criticisms.\n\nNow here is a summary of pros and cons, from my perspective.\n\nPROS:\n-- extremely light.  This is basically a tablet with a keyboard attached.  I love that portability, especially since this might be traveling in my backpack, which already weights almost 40 lbs.  This was a key factor in my selection of this item and this particular make and model.\n\n-- wifi receiver seems pretty strong.  Although i do have a very powerful router (so the TWC tech told me).  I've had no problem picking up signals in other locations.\n\n-- battery life is phenomenal, especially compared to my old HP laptop, which barely made 2.5 hours.  8 hours is not an exaggeration.  I've been using it off and on all day, starting at 10am, and I can see it will easily go to 6pm, perhaps later.  If I'd been streaming videos steadily all day, probably would impact that some, but far outstrips any other device I've used, including any smartphone.  EDIT: Oh - and this is at maximum brightness, bluetooth off, wireless on.\n\n--EDIT: battery charges to full in about 2 or 2.5 hours when depleted below 10%.\n\n-- volume, brightness, and other keys are clearly labeled and easy to use, no need to hit a \"function\" key.\n\n-- standard keyboard shortcuts apply (CTR-C/S/X, ALT-TAB, etc.)\n\n-- boots fast (seconds, almost instantly) and very zippy!  for web browing, documents etc., streaming videos - absolutely no bogging down\n\n-- has HDMI out, if i ever get a TV (not very likely)\n\nCONS\n\n--EDIT: the biggest drawback i have found to using this device is that the only way to add functions is to add apps, and although it's running a variation of the Android operating system, it will not run all Android apps, and you can forget about anything that requires a Windows exe file to install, such as Silverlight.  Also, Amazon Instant Video can only be streamed live from the amazon site; there is no instant video app for the chromebook, although apparently it does exist for regular android phones; why has Chromebook been slighted?  Those are the main ones that impacted me.  But carefully consider your software needs.  Incompatibility with silverlight caused me to miss out on an opportunity to help a friend via webcast, which was very disappointing to me.\n\n-- no ethernet port.  UPDATE: see first comment for a link to a usb ethernet adapter.\n\n-- no way to open a task manager if browser hangs, which has happened once in the week since I got it.  Holding the power button and hard-rebooting was my only recourse.  Seems to take longer than the five-second standard i'm used to, or perhaps it was slow responding due to the hang, had me a little worried.\n\n-- no delete button (minor) (see comment below for workaround)\n\n-- display is only fair, definitely not retinal, but i didn't expect that.\nthen again, the power any display draws has a huge effect on battery life, so maybe this is one reason the battery life on this device is so great.  i rely on battery power a lot, so i'll take that advantage any day.\n\n--EDIT: has the usual weak laptop speakers.  Depending on how the sound recorded in the videos I play, sometimes I can barely even hear them when the volume drops too low.  A pair of decent earbuds definitely improves loudness and quality.\n\nConsidering I got 25% off due to a \"lightning sale\" offer from amazon, I consider this little computer a very good value.  For document work, surfing, and streaming it has been more than adequate.\n\nAlso - on a tangent - i am using this with TWC's new 14.99/mo internet offering.  When I signed up and they heard I'd be streaming, they tried to tell me that wouldn't be a fast enough connection.  I'm happy to report they were wrong.  Great pairing for my needs."}

It's surprisingly capable to handle many tabs with typical applications such as gmail, facebook and google docs. It's light and doesn't look bad, and battery life is good.\n\nIt's important to keep in mind that the free 100GB of cloud storage are not allocated to your account automatically upon log in. Read the leaflet that comes with the computer to find out how to do it, as it adds a lot of value to it.\n\nMaking a silly comparison to a Macbook Air (the computer I'm coming from, and widely regarded as one of the most well-rounded notebooks available), it is amazing how little I feel I've lost. My usage is basically only chrome, so that may partly explain this feeling. The construction of this computer is nice, it feels solid and well put together. Of course it's plastic and Acer hasn't tried to hide the seams as Apple does, but the design is nice overall. From an aesthetics point of view, I just wish Acer's logo wasn't this ugly, as it kind of ruins the hardware's minimalistic design. The track pad doesn't have as nice a texture and it rattles a bit, but it tracks my finger reasonably well and much better than many computers with MS Windows. The keyboard is not as nice as the Macbook's (it's highest point) and it's not backlit, but it's perfectly capable and not annoying to use at all. The screen is not great either, but that is easily explained buy the price point.\n\nI've also found myself really enjoying the chromebook-specific versions of some of google's apps, such as photos or keep. For this computer to be really useful, it's important that you're completely into google's ecosystem. That's where the hardware and the software come together very nicely.\n\nIf acer made a version of this computer with no logos and an IPS screen (and maybe twice the ram and storage) it would have a hit in its hands."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "Best buy had this advertised online for 169.99 I bought it, went to the store and they charged me 149.99. This thing is amazing. There are no moving parts (already replaced the fan and hard drive in my 7 year old laptop due to bearings wearing out). The display is led so it should last ten years or more. It's super light.\n\nI love how it doesn't have f1 f2 keys ect, on the top of the keybaord, but to replace those it has brightness (seperate increase/decrease keys) and volume controls (mute, vol up, vol down), so it's very easy to adjust these which I do all the time, compared to going into settings blah blah blah.\n\nOne thing you need to know is the touchpad is different - there are no buttons next to it like a regular laptop. So to scroll down use two fingers and you will scroll up/down the page (love it), use one and it moves the cursor. To \"right click\" (copy, paste, save as) use two fingers.\n\nFor basic tasks, this works great. I have been using Unbuntu which has all the compatible office software (word, wordpad ect). I have not tried those on this yet."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "I originally found this chromebook on Bestbuy at for $159. But my local stores were out of stock so i thought i would get this some other time. Then Amazon had this on lighting deal for $149, what a steal -? Good job Amazon. I could not wait any longer then bought this chromebook. Also relalize being a prime member if you option into no rush delivery you get $1 credit for the digital content. That's why we all love Amazon. This was the fun part.\n\nI then receive this chromebook is 4days, i regretted the minute I open up the box, the device is thick, bulky, even thicker other larger screen notebooks, i regretted not to check what the device looks like first at Bestbuy, Should have done so i would then never made this purchase. I saw other chromebooks in bestbuy and none of them look this thick. For the same thickness it make no sense to buy a portable chromebook that is 11.6\", might as well just get an 14\" HP Chromebook instead, the white color option make the device look thicker and the pain looks really cheap work, like the 1st layer coating onto a plastic. The hinge attached to the screen is extremely fragile when you open it up. Very poor design.\n\nDesign is the only complaint this chormebook does what all chromebooks would do and it's fluid. fast. simple. Love the performance of this chromebook. But i just don't enjoy it, i know it's $149 but it's too ugly for me to enjoy using it. I would have to return this to buy another chromebook instead. hopefully there would be a sweet deal coming up shortly."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "When I flipped open the machine, I was greeted with a message stating, \"Chrome OS is missing or damaged.\" According to the Google website and a member of the Acer web community, a reinstallation of Chrome OS, through a process called recovery, is necessary to get the machine functioning. The process seemed pretty straight-forward, requiring the creation of recovery media using a USB flash drive or SD card. However, each time I tried to create the recovery media on a Windows desktop, the process stalled and ultimately failed. This is very frustrating. I would return the chromebook, but I can't find the packaging. Even if the recovery process worked, I'd still rate the computer 1-2 stars because it should come with an OS pre-installed!"}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "I knew that chromebooks used the ChromeOS.  However, I made the mistake of thinking that the same apps that I have on my Nexus would also be available for my Chromebook.  Big mistake!  And I'm not talking about obscure, 3rd-party apps.  I can watch TV on my Nexus using the google Fiber app but for some reason this app does not exist for the Chromebook.  There are about a dozen other quality apps I use regularly on my Nexus that aren't available for chromebooks (there are, however, thousands of useless apps available!).  Very disappointing when google doesn't support its own OS.  For money, I would recommend getting a Nexus tablet (which seems to have more apps) or spending a little extra and get a Windows-based laptop that isn't handcuffed by the ChromeOS."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "I am really impressed with this Chromebook. I haven't owned one before, but I have owned several desktops as well as a few laptops and 2 Macbook Pro's over the course of the last 10 years. A few things are notably impressive about the Chromebook -- easy to use, very light, excellent screen/sound quality for $200, and pretty fast. I'd say a con is that if you have anything that isn't compatible with the web browser Chrome, you may have issues, but I think the intended purpose of this product is pretty explicit.\n\nIt has an HDMI output which is great. I hooked up a Logitech wireless mouse/keyboard combo in my living room and hooked the Chromebook up to 60\" HDTV and use the Chromebook as a Netflix, Hulu, Youtube and Amazon Video device. In addition to those applications/websites, it also makes it very convenient to be able to pop open a new tab and check my e-mail, hit some of my favorite websites (ESPN for example, or, you know... Brazzers) and then return to whatever else I was doing. I know that an XB1 and a PS4 are capable video streaming application players and a lot of new TV's have these video streaming services (not Brazzers) integrated into their software, but for $200 this Chromebook is a good bargain for those uses, especially when coupled with web browsing capabilities that are fast and fluid.\n\nI don't think this product is intended to replace a desktop or a laptop, but if you're on a budget (like a college student) this may be right up your alley. It utilizes Google office online, which is fairly similar to just having it on a desktop or laptop -- it's certainly serviceable if your main use for academic and professional purposes are writing papers, creating powerpoints, etc.\n\nThe drawbacks of this product are that it doesn't have a CD-ROM (again, as advertised), it only has 16GB hard drive and only 2GB of RAM. However, that being said, it does come with 100GB of online storage and in spite of its specs, it runs really fast and smoothly because of its intended purpose(s). By intended purposes, I refer to another slight drawback -- this thing is a whole lot of useless without a Wifi connection. So, if you're looking for a laptop that you can double as a DVD player while you're camping or that you can store a lot of music/movies/TV shows/podcasts on and use while on the road or something, this probably isn't the product for you. It doesn't fulfill every purpose, but it fills its niche really, really well.\n\nFor the extra $175 I'm tempted to get one of these with 32GB HD and 4GB RAM just to see if it's worth the upgrade, but that would probably be silly since I already have a Macbook Pro that I bought in 2014 for academic and professional purposes.\n\nMy last point on the drawbacks is that it doesn't have a caps lock button (takes some getting use to for me) and in the calculator application, when you hit \"enter\" it clears everything -- you gave to hit the = button instead.\n\nConclusively, this product is an easy 5* rating and if there was a 6/5 star rating I would give it to this item. This is the perfect traveling/coffee shop/living room item that is very useful, especially for such a low price point. This product far exceeds the quality of a laptop that costs $300-$400, in my honest opinion, even if you can squeeze a few more uses out of the laptops."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "After trying out two high-end Ultrabooks and countless hours of researching Chome OS and comparing it with other \"lower\" end Windows laptops, I decided to take the plunge - and I am honestly blown away. I have yet to encounter a single site or app that will not play in Chrome OS - including Amazon Prime (which has smooth video playback) and even Pogo (in spite of previous blogs and complaints across the web of incompatibility). Evidently the folks at EA have taken note, as have others, or the next great and upcoming wave to replace bulky, sluggish, battery-draining laptops.\n\nMy main draw was looking for a lightweight and portable \"laptop\" I could use for school, without adding 5 pounds to an already-loaded backpack. Also, the 9.5-10.5 hour battery life seems legit - with 84% (9:44) of batter remaining after nearly three hours of web browsing and Plex movie watching (yes, the Plex app runs flawlessly - even with Subs).\n\nThough I will not argue of the need for a Windows device for software like Photoshop or memory-intensive DAW music production (for which I have a high-end desktop PC), as that is not the need for this Chromebook, I cannot say that I miss the functionality.\n\nI haven't noticed any sluggishness as of yet, though that is not my intent. I am simply using it as I normally use a PC or laptop, and thus far, I am undeniably impressed - especially for a Celeron processor. Also, the keyboard is phenomenal, the touchpad is the best quality and sensitivity I have ever had the pleasure of using, and the bright 720p screen leaves little to be desired (other than the minor viewing angle adjustments here and there). The size is just right - not too big, but just large enough to accommodate the incredibly accurate and comfortable chicklet keyboard.\n\nThough I felt I was taking a gamble plunging into Chrome OS with so many unanswered questions, let me just say one thing - I have found my new laptop (no, not my 2nd, but my primary) and I am sure it will keep me satisfied for many years to come!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "I didn't buy this computer from Amazon as I had a gift card to a large electronic store... But regardless of where it came from, what is important is that I absolutely do not regret my purchase and would have bought it from anywhere! I have had it for a little less than a month and I use it every single day. I also have an Ultrabook (HP Dv4) which is great, but I accidentally cracked the screen (it still works) and have been scared to take it around with me places for fear of damaging it even further. My goal for buying a Chromebook was to have something cheap as a backup that I could take with me and use if I needed it at school or work. But I have found that I haven't even logged onto my Ultrabook since I bought this Chromebook!! I would have never believed I would use this Chromebook at home when I have a perfectly functioning laptop. Why? Several reasons:\n\n1) The connection to the internet is so fast. At home, it is instantly connected and boots up in the blink of an eye. At my university, there is special software you have to log into when you connect, which is bypassed with this Chromebook since it does not have the ability to download external software. The OS remembers the network and automatically connects me. Every once in a while it makes me sign in on the website (just like it would a phone), but normally I'm connected within five seconds of opening my computer. More than I can say for my laptop.\n\n2) Google Docs. Need I say more? Automatically saving to the cloud, I never have to worry about losing a document! And it's so easy to use. Sure it's not fully loaded with all of the features of Microsoft Office, but you can do the same basic things (spreadsheets, documents, presentations) for absolutely free. Worth it right there. Also, the ability to share right on the screen with someone else is really convenient for group work. And you can use Google Docs even without the internet, it just doesn't upload to the cloud until you are connected to wifi.\n\n3) It's SO lightweight. Seriously. Even with the hard snap on case that I bought for it, it weighs next to nothing. I bought a small messenger bag for it which I carry my computer and external hard drive in and it's lighter than my purse. It's really easy to take literally everywhere. I love to write, so wherever the mood strikes me, I can open it and write.\n\n4) I said this before, but it deserves another mention: You can still use Google Docs without the internet!! This by itself is what sold me. I love writing and I was concerned about a computer that only operates with wifi since I'm not always around an internet connection. But you can still write till your heart's content, you just can't save it to the cloud until you hit a wifi area. I love this feature. I can still type up papers or a story or whatever and either save it on the computer until I can get to internet, or I'll just save it on my external hard-drive which I always bring with me.\n\n5) USB ports for flashdrives and external hard drives. Connects so easily, and gives you an extended amount of space without having to compromise your (Very very very) small hard-drive.\n\n6) It's stylish. It's white with black keys and I have a red cover for it that snaps on. I get compliments all the time. People assume it's a Macbook from far away because it is so sleek. Not that it's a huge reason to buy something, but aesthetics can be important, especially if you are a business/academic professional.\n\n7) It's just $199. I mean, really. Can you beat that??? Sure you can't play video games on it or do photoshop... but for the average internet use and basic documents/spreadsheets... it's an insane deal. Phones cost more than this!!\n\n8) Battery life. I have this thing unplugged more than plugged and it's amazing! Sometimes I even lose my charger because I can't remember where I put it the last time I used it, which is typically days in between. The battery life is over 8 hours of continuous use, which for me would be able three days in between needing charged.\n\n9) It opens almost 180 degrees. This may seem silly, but when you are laying in bed and you are propping it up on your knees, it's amazing to be able to have it almost flat so that you can type and see the screen at the same time. I love this feature because I'm usually in bed writing after my husband and daughter are asleep.\n\n10) The trackpad is the easiest trackpad I've ever used. It is really responsive and scrolls like a breeze. Clicking on things was super easy to figure out, more so than my Ultrabook, which after 2 years I'm still not quite sure how to use. In fact, all of the features on it were pretty easy to figure out without reading the manual. It is definitely an out of the box and use type of computer, which I love. Anyone can figure it out, no matter how technologically disinclined you are! :)\n\nThere are a few very small cons:\n\n1) Some wifi connections won't connect. I suspect this is the sign in screen not being prompted. It has only happened in one place, and I'm going to research it further but it's not a huge hindrance since if I can't use the internet on here I'll just use my phone. I really use this for writing when I'm out and about since I have data on my phone. Not a deal breaker.\n\n2) There is no caps lock button. I'm not a hardcore caps lock typer, but sometimes I'd like to be able to type in caps lock without having to hold shift. Instead of the caps lock button it's the search button, which I inadvertently hit all the time... I literally just hit it when trying to type the word all, because sometimes I am a type-screamer for emphasis. :/\n\nThat's all I can think of now. I really really love this computer. It is the best $199 I have ever spent!"}

I love the OS and even if I didn't I could install another one on it. I love the look of it. It reminds me of my old macbook. I like it more than my old macbook though because of the size and lightness. I have had no problems with it since starting it up. The battery life is amazing. I've gotten 11 hours out of this computer and it recharges super fast. I use it more than my HP Envy which is getting lonely. I also got 1TB of cloud storage from google for 2 years which pretty much paid for my laptop. I can't praise this device enough. I wish I could use it at work honestly. It also has the fastest boot up of any computer I've ever used. I open it and it's ready to go. I also don't really need to worry that much about viruses which is nice. I think anyone looking for a solid user experience with a simple and clean os should look at this computer. It's really a gem.\n\nUPDATE: I'd pair this computer with WD My Passport Ultra (which works because you don't need drivers for it) or a USB memory stick or an SD. I know that kind of defeats the purpose of cloud driven computing which is primarily what the chromebook is for but I have had nothing but trouble with the cloud that google provides. My movies are not immediately viewable on the cloud. They take forever (if at all) to process to be viewable. I have never had a movie process so I don't know if it works. I have deleted things only to have them appear momentarily and then disappear. Let's not even talk about my music. It's just been a weird experience. I caved and bought the WD My Passport Ultra from target for cheap and it's been a godsend. I only use the cloud for my docs now and even then I think I will primarily use the Microsoft Office online (which is free and has 15 GB free from their drive) because I have run into weird formatting issues in googledoc when converting into a word document. Even though I love my chromebook the cloud driven experience has been awful and frustrating ultimately. Sorry google."}

Both have nice bright displays (the default is something like 70% brightness every time I turn on each unit, and a couple bumps of the brightness button brings it right up--honestly, 70% is pretty good and I don't notice half the time).\nKEYBOARD - Both feel great.  Short stroke with positive \"snap\" for fast and confident typing. Keyboards are VERY similar.  The \"Function\" keys along the top are handy (they're not dual-purpose--you just press them, without having to hold CTRL, or Fn, etc).  I heavily use the Home, End, and Delete buttons normally, and the fact that they aren't included on these devices is frustrating, since it slows my editing down.\nMOUSE - Good feel on both devices.  It's a click-pad style, so if you want to right-click, you just tap with 2 fingers at the same time--simple enough.  I have also used a USB mouse without any issue.  It picks up immediately, with full functionality.  Due to the small size of the unit, I occasionally accidentally click the pad or move the cursor with the base of my thumbs, but it's rare and not a big deal.\nI'd also like to point out that in the Settings, you can change the mouse 2-finger scrolling from \"normal\" to \"Australian\".  This setting determines which way the page scrolls for your 2-finger up/down dragging.\nAUDIO - Big difference here.  The Samsung wins--no competition.  Both units get decent volume, but the sound quality from the Samsung is much greater--not that it's like my Bose Soundlink III, but it does quite well, and feels \"full\".  The Acer is very tinny and sounds cheap.\nWEIGHT - Both units are lightweight.  Difference is minimal.\nPERFORMANCE - Similar. Nothing noticeably different.\nBATTERY - Similar.  Both last 4-8+ hours.  I've watched >2hrs on Netflix on battery and the units are only warm, and used ~30% battery.\nWEBCAM - Didn't test to compare.  I don't expect much out of these anyway.\n\nCHROME OS - There's nothing to it, really.  If you use Chrome on another computer and are signed into Chrome (not just to your Google account on a webpage--signed in to CHROME), then the experience is identical, minus other programs.  If my company didn't want me to use MS Office and Outlook (and if I didn't play Skyrim), I'd use one of these instead of my laptop for just about everything."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "I have found my new best friend - The Acer CB3-111 Chromebook!\nI take this everywhere and just enjoy every minute I use it.\n\nHardware, OS, Chrome extensions ...all work excellently to create the best computing experience bang for the buck.\nFor 97% of what I do on a computer, the Chrome OS and Acer work better than I ever expected.\n\nI consider myself to be very computer savvy from a user and technological standpoint. I own gaming desktops, laptops, macbooks, imacs, etc and can say the Chromebook is the best of them all for most of my needs. Although I have not tried to edit video, pictures or other heavy creation on the Chromebook, it appears they have apps that do work for those functions -but- if I were a video or photo editing power user, I would stick with a MAC or PC. That being said, I think the \"sweet spot\" for the Chromebook lies in its size, speed, battery life, minimalist approach and value.\n\nIn my opinion if you went more than 11+ inches on the screen, you lose some of the real value of a Chromebook and you are getting into \"just buy a mac or PC territory\".\n\nRecently, I purchased my college age son a Mac Book Air for approx $1000. Before the MAc AIr purchase I tried to buy a PC laptop on sale for approximately $350 which was supposedly a good deal. I returned the PC and bought the MAC. Had I known how excellent the hardware and OS for the Chromebooks were, I might have tried to get him a Chromebook instead. My hesitation was thinking he would be limited if his instructors required a Word or Excel document. After using the Chromebook, I am thinking my fears were unfounded ... you can import/export Word and Excel docs into the Google Docs and Sheets applications. Yes, there are some minor compromises but after using the Chromebook for a week now, I really think it is the future of personal computing.  It is almost like you have to get one and try it to understand how the Windows  OS, installing expensive software, large hard drives, etc seems antiquated. For the price of a Chromebook, it certainly is not a big risk to try and you can use it as a second computer. It is not going to replace your gaming PC but is actually a better option for surfing the web, watching videos, checking mail, etc.\n\nGive it a try - you won't be disappointed.\n\nBy the way - not sure if this is specific to the Acer, but the keyboard and hardware are on par with the Mac Air my son purchased. Just amazing!"}

The internet on this is way faster and no intermittent wifi problems, like I had with the Samsung. It also is thin, light, and much more solid feeling than the Samsung. And it has a sharper screen resolution and better audio. Can't beat the price on it. I would recommend!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "I purchased this for my son as a gift for his 10th birthday. Amazon offered this Chromebook for a short time for $159.99, and I jumped on it! Especially, thanks to the many positive reviews, which helped me make my final decision in it's purchase. To get to the point in this review, I'm going to say that I am beyond pleased with this purchase! Couldn't be happier! Most importantly, my son is the happiest!\nWe decided on the Chromebook because he uses them in his school, and is familiar to it's use. Also, Google offers so many options in web based programs and apps which can apply to many needs or use requirements. With that said, its simply a Google Chrome operating system, with allot to offer! Easy to use, with a very user friendly web based help desk if needed. Set-up is a breeze. Battery life is excellent, as advertised, and sound quality, is great! Can I say \"fast\", fast enough? This runs, and loads pages fast! Structure and build quality are superb! Not at all flimsy, or cheaply made. Not too heavy in weight, however, its not too light either. just solid. Track pad is accurate and very responsive to touch. Works great. I did purchase an optical mouse for him to use, and that works great as well. He uses both options. Screen resolution is outstanding, not that I am an expert on resolution or anything, but it really is great. This device features a front facing camera, an SD card slot, two USB ports, one HDMI port, as well as a headphone jack. Just plain awesome-sauce! However, with all the awesome this device has to offer, it is still crisp and white... Which means finger print marks, easily! I highly recommend a shell case cover which can be purchased separately, of course."}

I get about 7-9 hours of battery life depending on what I am doing. A couple things to note if you are considering are that this is a small laptop, the screen is small, and if you look at the screen at an angle it washes out, so if that matters to you be warned. Overall an excellent product!"}

A one finger click anywhere on the touchpad equates to a left click. My issue is that the touchpad is so sensitive that my scroll is occasionally interpreted as a click and I go somewhere unwanted. A minor problem and in time I may seek a remedy in desensitizing the touchpad. All in all I highly recommend this Chromebook."}

And that it is!  It's a nice plug and play ... all works great together ... a large monitor, full size ergonomic keyboard, uninterruptable power supply, super stereo system desktop PC for ... get this! ... about $400!!!  Come on!! Try to beat that!  Happy camper here! I also added a HP laser color printer for $170!  Challenge anyone to come up with a better value overall!\n\nOnly one word for this puppy ... wow!  No, make that ... WOW!!  This is an excellent value ... got mine for $160. Even at $200, still what a Chromebook should be. It's very responsive, very fast WiFi, well-made, excellent screen, comfortable keyboard, light weight, thin, works perfect with a Logitech mouse. Well worth the money!  I have so come to like (close to \"love\"!) Chromebooks!  This is my third, and I use Chrome features on my Mac at work. I am an old geek ... started with hobby computers in the 60's. Was a big Microsoft fan until Vista (now an ABM guy ... Anything But Microsoft!). But because of the nature of my work, I do regularly work with PCs (all versions of Windows), Macs, and Chromebook. My personal preference is now overwhelmingly the Chromebook. Not that I haven't been frustrated at times in the early going ... Bluetooth streaming was horrible ... but now, it all is working well, really well!  And this little gem is just that ... a nice GEM!\n\nMore updating:  this Acer Chromebook is really, really nice, especially for the money!! I now have four Chromebooks (two Acers, one Samsung, and one Asus) ... from a user perspective, they are indistinguishable. Pick up one and it works exactly the same way as the others (thank you, Google!). The files automatically save online (Google Drive) so always ready to go from one machine to another. I also have a Mac at work, but I now just use it as a Chromebook ... easy to do, just open the Chrome browser and there it goes!  BTW, that's an easy way to explore a Chromebook without actually buying one. Just use the Chrome browser and Google Drive. It works on Mac and PCs just fine. But on a Chromebook, it works better, faster, cheaper!!  Also, lots of other apps for Chrome browser that are really good (MindMup, Draw.io for starters)."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "I am really impressed with this device. I normally stay away from items that I perceive as being budget devices because you usually get what you pay for but wow this thing is great. A couple of years ago I had the first ARM based Samsung Chromebook and it was ok but ChromeOS has really matured since then and when it is combined with this hardware, it creates a fantastic experience.\n\nI bought this primarily because I recommended a Chromebook for my non-tech savvy 78 year old mom. She got a 14 inch Dell and loves it and uses it all the time but to my surprise, I also used it all the time when I go to visit. It is incredibly fast and smooth for browsing the internet, even compared to my Core i7 Windows machine. I bought my daughter a Chromebook for Christmas because even though she had a Windows laptop, she wanted a machine like she has at school. She also loves it.\n\nThe thing that impresses me so much about it is video playback. It is great for Netflix, even when it is set to 1080p and connected to my TV. It also works great for displaying video from my Plex media server.  I also put some mp4 videos on the hard drive and they played great too.\n\nThe other thing that is great is the battery life. I am tying this on it right now and I have been using it as couch browser when I watch TV since yesterday and the battery is at 66%. Speaking of typing, the keyboard and trackpad are fantastic for writing and browsing.\n\nSomething that reviewers almost always leave out about Chromebooks and the thing I like best about them is that your user experience is not tied to the hardware so you can log on to any Chromebook and have the same user experience. When I log on to my mom's Chromebook, it looks exactly like mine. All of my apps are \"installed\" and my desktop wallpaper is displayed."}

I was also leery about the Chrome OS since all I've ever used was Windows, but wow. I mean wow do I love this.\n\nI needed something light and basic (email, Facebook, documents etc.) and I needed it on the cheap. This Chromebook arrived the day after I ordered it and there was absolutely no setup required. I've used Chrome as my browser for years, so there was no learning curve there at all. I had't realized how much of my laptop use is online now anyway, I barely noticed that I was using a non Windows OS. Google Docs is every bit as functional (and intuitive) as Word, and the rest of the Google apps have more than met my other needs.\n\nOh and the battery life. Seriously amazing. I forgot what it was like not to have to haul a charger with me. I can use this all day and still have power. This isn't going to be the best laptop if you are concerned about viewing angles since the screen is only view able from straight ahead, but I actually prefer the privacy that provides me in public. And did I mention the 100 GB of Google Drive storage?\n\nAll in all, this laptop is perfect for me."}

As a big google fan (gmail, google drive, chrome, gchat, etc,) I am simply thrilled. The free TB (that's right, free TB!) of google drive storage for 2 years makes the phenomenal price of $160 even better. It took less than 90 seconds out of the box to log into my google account and dive right in - about as long as it took my husband to proclaim that he needs one too! Perhaps the best $160 I've spent - if you're on the fence, go for it!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "This thing is amazing so far. I wanted something portable and practical, without the bulk and pricetag of a full laptop since I have a perfectly capable PC at home. The price is incredible for what you get here. The speed is awesome! It boots up and loads pages lightning fast. My PC has an SSD and I was still impressed.\n\nA lot of the complaints I'm reading are from people who don't understand what a Chromebook is for. These things are meant to be cost-efficient and extremely practical machines that are mainly just for internet browsing, streaming and word processing. It is not meant for gaming or photoshop. It is bare-bones essentials in a pretty package so that you don't have to drop hundreds on a laptop if you don't need one. I urge you to look up the capabilities of a Chromebook before you purchase one, and compare that to what you actually need it for. Personally, I want to use it for online classes and studying and it's built perfectly for that. When I want to play Steam games or sync iTunes, I do that on my home PC.\n\nMy only problem so far is that the Chromebook got stuck on the \"Determining Device Configuration\" screen, and it was easily solved with a reboot. I have had no troubles since. It connected flawlessly to my gmail account, and the advertised 100GB of Google Drive space was apparently bumped up to a Terabyte (1000GB). Maybe I read it wrong but that was a nice surprise. It's free for two years.\n\nIf you are an avid Google user, you will find that all of your Chrome settings port over seamlessly from your home computer. My theme, bookmarks and preferences were all imported without me having to do anything.\n\nThe quality of the Chromebook itself is great for the price (great anyway, but ESPECIALLY for the price). The white color looks very clean and modern. My mom has a newer Chromebook and when she saw mine she said \"Oh, yours is nicer than mine!\". Looks great, feels sturdy. No backlit keys on the keyboard is my only gripe with the structure of it.\n\nLastly, the battery life blows away my old laptop and even my phone. I've been using it for almost five hours straight unplugged (internet browsing and playing music) and I'm still at 71%. I feel like I'm going to lose the charger if I'm not careful because I won't be using it much. If you want something easy, portable and long-lasting- this Chromebook is an awesome deal. I think it's cheaper because it doesn't have a touchscreen, but who needs that anyway? If that doesn't bother you, you're getting a great bargain."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "My family has gone through a few Chromebooks, and this one is the best so far. It seems to have the sturdiest frame and keyboard. It has enough memory and processing power to handle all of our web activities, including watching movies and video chatting, as well as a lot of office work on Google Drive and sometimes Microsoft OneDrive.  We still keep a Windows computer for some software like Rosetta Stone and to use the full Word program for heavily formatted Word files (which we usually create in Google first and use Word to ensure the formatting is correct). The 11\" model is a good size. I have big hands and it still works fine for me. For longer typing sessions I will sometimes attach a standard keyboard to the USB port. I recommend it for the kids (with the warning that it won't run Minecraft) because it's inexpensive and they can't infect it with viruses or screw up the software and if they do it can be factory reset in a few moments. At first I didn't want a white computer and almost decided against it; however, it's turned out to be a big benefit because white makes it easy to spot. This is an important feature, because it's the go-to and carry-around device that we all share, so it's kind of like the TV remote control in that it could be anywhere. Overall, this is a good deal and ACER is the best of the Chromebook makers even if there are a few better brand names that are generally better with other computers. Maybe the biggest benefit of Chromebooks in general for our family is that it protects our more expensive (and still very necessary and quite vulnerable) Windows machine safe from our rough children and malware.\n\nUpdate: 6/19/15 - Seven Months Ownership\n\nIt's still holding up with no troubles and being quite productive."}

I have 2 other laptops, but they're a little cumbersome to tote around. I liked the 11\" size and the $199 price. However, one of the main uses I wanted this computer for is to play Big Fish games with the kids. We love playing them. But to my utter disappointment, I can't download any games from Big Fish. There are a few in the Chrome store, but they're not top quality, and the screen is too small. You can't run them full screen. You can also play online from the Big Fish site, but again poor selection and small screen.\n\nFor many users, this isn't a problem. But for me, this is a deal breaker. I'm keeping it only because I ordered 2 HP Stream 11s in a row, and both wouldn't connect to my wifi, so I had to return them. I don't want Amazon thinking I'm crazy by returning a 3rd computer within 2 weeks. I just ordered the Toshiba 11.6\"  laptop (not a Chrome) because I need a Windows based computer for my needs.\n\nAll the speed etc. on this Chrome doesn't help me if I can't use the programs I want. The no external download thing is a major turn off for me.\n\nSo if you like to play casual games with a full screen, forget buying a Chrome."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "I really only purchased this device for the 2 years free of Google Drive storage and at such a low price it was a good opportunity to see what Chrome OS is all about. Initially my realistically low expectations were more than exceeded. Unfortunately to reach such an affordable price, they had to use the cheapest hardware around. For me that means a camera that doesn't work and a wi-fi card that can't seem to stay connected. Without a reliable wi-fi connection this thing is basically useless - which is where I'm at right now. Apparently others have had better luck, so it still might be worth the gamble to pick one up and hope you get a good one."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "It's an amazing little laptop for the price and chrome OS isn't as bad as I first thought the first time I read about it. My only complain is that the first laptop I got had a couple of dead pixels. Amazon being the awesome store that it is sent me a replacement which I'm using right now but again I found one dead pixel. Other than that the build quality is better than expected, keyboard is comfortable, screen is nice enough and laptop feels sturdy enough to throw in my bag without worrying much and for $200 I think it's an excellent device to carry around instead of a $1300 laptop."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "This is one fantastic personal computer! A little about me first - I am a long-time user of both Microsoft Windows and Mac OSX. I own desktop and laptop computers for both of those. I own a 24-inch iMac, a Macbook Pro retina and a Macbook Air.\nI was looking for something cheap to travel with that had a long battery life, a good keyboard and a reasonable screen - primarily for taking notes, watching movies and listening to music.\nI was VERY skeptical about Chromebooks. Like many people, I thought that they had to be tethered to the Internet in order to get anything done. BOY WAS I WRONG :-)\nThis is a FANTASTIC laptop. Make no mistake - this compares very favorably with my Macbook Air. The keyboard is very good - nice amount of key travel and a nice \"clickiness\" as other reviewers have mentioned. Key spacing is good and I can get a good typing speed. The trackpad is as good or better than the trackpad on the Macbook Air. Read that again :-)  I really mean that - the glide is good, it is a huge size and tap-to-click works great. The general build quality is AMAZING for the price - in fact at any price. No flex, very light and it feels like it will last a long time. Nice sturdy hinges - the screen doesn't wiggle around like I have seen on some of the cheaper laptops.\nBattery life is about 8-9 hours for me with full brightness and doing word processing, watching YouTube videos, etc.\nThe other nice thing is that this laptop charges from empty to full in just over one hour - that's pretty amazing.\n\nHere are the apps I use:\n\n- Google Docs - do all my writing in this. Works seamlessly offline and online - just keep typing and it syncs back up when it gets online again. Never need to save anything - it does it in real time as it goes along. Safe and secure in the cloud.\n- All my browser bookmarks synced to every computer in the house when I login to Chrome - nice!\n- Google Sheets - maintain all my household finances in this - works as good as or better than Excel. Never need to save. Works offline just as good as online.\n- Spotify - listen to music\n- Kindle Cloud Reader - all my Kindle books are available online AND OFFLINE in this. Very nice presentation - better presentation than on a Kindle.\n- Writebox - this is a little note-taking application. Stores the data locally, even when you shut it down. Stores as many notefiles as you need locally. Syncs with Google Drive if you need to. Very nice application - lightweight ad FAAAAAAAST\n- Google Drive - all my files from all my computers stored both up in the cloud and on the computers. On this Chromebook, I can select which files should be made available offline and I can work on them even when offline. Very nice.  Got ONE TERABYTE of free Google Drive storage for two years when I purchased this Acer Chromebook. That means I really got the Chromebook for FREE! :-)\n- Google Maps, Google Calendar, etc, etc - I make good use of a lot of the Google ecosystem.\n- Google + Photos - all my photos available here. You do have to be online to use this. 10,000 photos at my fingertips. Nice.\n- Google Slides - you can use this online and offline too - as good as or better than PowerPoint for the reasonably simple presentations that I need to work with. Nice.\n\nSo...I highly recommend checking out this Chromebook if you need something inexpensive to write on, watch movies and YouTube, work on simple spreadsheets and presentations, do research and entertain yourself on the web, listen to music, etc. I am more than happy - I am ECSTATIC with this laptop - in fact I bought a second one, so I can work uninterrupted for up to 16 hours offline when traveling without needing to find a power outlet! - hahahaaa.\n\nThis is, without a doubt, the best money I have ever spent on a piece of technology."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "I purchased two of these at BB for $150 and just had the opportunity to play with it for a couple of days.\n\nPros:\n\nIt does what it is meant to do. It is not a windows or IOS machine. It is a surfing machine that allows you to take full use of the Google system to write documents, print to a cloud-enable printer, play light games and surf the internet quickly.\n\nNo lag between between browser opening and rendering.\n\nVideos from YouTube look great. Streaming live programming works beautifully. (If you have a chromecast stick as well, you won't miss cable)\n\nSmall form factor and light-weight. It fits in a backpack, purse, bag... glove compartment.\n\nScreen has no glare which makes it easier to read books, articles, and blogs in almost any setting.\n\nThe screen size seems perfectly normal for anyone used to switching between their laptop/desktop to a tablet.\n\nKeyboard is intuitive for typing. I had to actually think about the keyboard when writing this because the switch from laptop to this keyboard was effortless.\n\nThe track pad is large and easy to use if you like working with track pads instead of a mouse. The double-click can be disabled if desired in the settings.\n\nThe sound is great on this little machine, voices in movies and TV programs are clear. You may want to raise the Chromebook by adding removable feet *see cons below*\n\nBattery life is about 8 hours of continuous use (more if you lower settings) and it charges quickly. I got it from the store with no charge at all. In about 2 hours, the battery was fully charged.\n\nCons:\n\nHere is why this review did not get 5 stars;\n\nThe only way to disable the track pad is via command line and this is only temporary. This may be cumbersome for people who want to use an external mouse most of the time and not accidentally touch the track pad and make errors.\n\nThe speakers are located on the bottom of the machine. This means that when you use it on your lap or atop a table/desk, you are not getting the full effect of the speakers. IMO, this is an idiotic location for speakers and getting removable feet just takes away from the no-fuss, no-muss, of what this piece of equipment is designed to do. Besides getting \"feet\" to prop the unit to get full use of the speakers, the other solutions involve a Bluetooth speakers or headphones.\n\nThere are others out there that Velcro onto the machine, or are permanently attached and fold out, but these will give you an idea of what I mean by removable feet: http://www.amazon.com/Fred-Friends-Istuck-Laptop-Feet/dp/B00C3O0W0E/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1417735766&sr=8-2&keywords=feet+to+raise+laptop\n\nConclusion:\n\nTaking this to campus or a trip is ideal due to its lack of bulk and weight, has a keyboard (better than most tablets) and it is a fast web surfer and movie-watching machine while waiting for a couple of hours or sitting in a plane."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "Excellent value for $150, but the Acer C720 is still Top Dog in the budget Chromebook category.  Not a lot of differences between the two, but the CB3 is 4 ounces lighter (2lbs-6oz) then the C720.  However, the CB3 is 1/2\" wider and I prefer the smaller size.  The CB3 also seems to be marginally slower when surfing, but you probably won't notice unless you're currently using a C720.  The CB3 has the power plug and HDMI port on the back side, whereas the C720 ports are all on the sides.\n\nI should mention that I purchased 2 of these and one of them appears to have a hardware issue, associated with Flash/Shock Wave webpages.  I performed several 'Powerwashes' and updated the ChromeOS to 39.02171.85 (same as the other CB3) but it will randomly crash and re-start.  I'm planning to take it back to BB for an exchange."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "This is a tough item to review. For the past 10 years, Ive worked with Dell laptops and have never used a Chromebook.  In my mind, I start comparing the two but I know thats not really a fair comparison since a laptop and a Chromebook such as this one are designed for entirely different things.  Ill write about the Chromebook itself and then list some of things I had a hard time with in switching from a regular laptop to this one.\n\nFirst, this thing is very lightweight.  Having been used to lugging around my Dell laptop, this comes as a welcome relief. Plus, since it is small, it would be very easy to carry around in a book bag or something similar. Second, the battery life leaves my old computer in the dust.  My kids have watched several movies over the course of a couple of days (no other use during that time) and I didn't need to plug it in until the third day. Third, it starts up very quickly. Lift the lid and a second later my login screen shows up.\nEverything is browser based, from using Gmail to Google Docs. While at home or around a wi-fi connection, this is great.  However, Ive not been able to figure out how to use things offline, especially like downloading movies for my kids when we go on trips. Im sure theres a way, but so far Ive not been able to figure that one out. Also, some of the apps that you can get from the Google Play store seem more designed for a phone than for a computer like this.\n\nSo for what its designed for, particularly needing an internet connection, this computer is great.  And because of this, Im giving it 4 stars.\n\nThat being said, having never used one of these before, I had some difficulty adjusting to it. First and biggest drawback for me is, well, the need to always be connected in order to use the computer.  Id like to be able to use it on the road where I don't always have connection.  Another thing I noticed is that the keyboard is different.  Its just a few small things: usual buttons missing like no page up/down buttons, no delete button (but there is a backspace), or no caps lock (took me awhile to figure out how to turn on caps lock); and some buttons added that don't really seem needed, like search, a back AND forward (not the arrows), reload and full screen buttons. Again, these are minor, but its taken me a little bit to get used to the keyboard.\n\nAgain, for what its designed for, it seems great.  If you're looking for a small, incredibly lightweight computer to use for constant connectivity, this is a pretty good one, especially for the price."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "i so wanted to like my first Chromebook - i really did.  at the end of the day, I think i had my expectations waaay too high...i thought at the very least, the speed of my web browsing would exceed my 2.16Ghz Core 2 Duo Macbook (2007 - i mean it's been 7 years, come on) and it felt the same to me.  I'm probably too hard core of a Chrome user - i love being able to switch users quickly - i actually found a feature to do this on the Chromebook but it's not quite the same as having separate user accounts *each* with multiple Google accounts - on the Chromebook - they are mashed together and filling up the front screen with 6 Google accounts I have on the browser I'm using right now... I prefer one laptop login and then having access to multiple Google account - this clearly minimizes security risk.\n\nto give this netbook some credit, the camera is better than my MacBook - i notice it deals with low-lighting really well.  It also has *great* battery life - to experience what it's like to be able to use a laptop for like 8-9 hours is incredible - it's a totally different ballpark!  this is the kind of laptop you'd use next to the TV for sure.\n\nfor kicks, I did put it into Developer Mode to see how well it would run Ubuntu.  now props up to the developers for allowing it to switch to Linux *without* rebooting (wow) - i wasn't able to get the installer for Skype and TheBrain to work and unfortunately don't have the bandwidth to figure this out right now - i was hoping they would just work the first time w minimal fuss.\n\nI also tried to install new apps like Evernote and while no fault of anyone - it's just a rough port from Android and unfortunately as an iOS and Mac OS X user, it really pales in comparison.  but this is software, I'm sure it will be get updated over time.  it's just not the replacement I was excited about after attending Google I/O 2014.\n\nthe keys and trackpad felt pretty sticky - my workaround is to use my bluetooth keyboard & mouse - then i discovered bluetooth pairing is *super* flakey [esp w bluetooth speakers that work find on iOS & Mac OS X] - in fact, it's what I would expect of a developer product - this is when I realized this product isn't ready yet & put a nail in the coffin - it needs another 2-3 years.\n\nour family has a Chromecast and thought this would work without a hitch - nope.  it got really confusing fast -  it was unpredictable whether it was going to mirror the screen, cast the video stream...  then once you get it working, it's not clear if the playlist has been put in the queue because it's giving you a button to add the list to the queue - it's a complete mess.\n\nwhile this is more of my being indoctrinated by the Command key on a mac, it drove me absolutely batty to have to use Ctrl all the time (so you Windows converts need not worry)\n\nat the end of the day, I realized I guess I'm the kind of user that needs to shell 3-6x for a MacBook Air and have the flexibility to run mac, Windows, and Linux.  it's hard to put Google at fault for $200-250.  I got mine for $150 and thought this would help make this product shine a bit more for its price point...but nope.\n\nother last bits -  the power nib on the back seems super flimsy and seems like it might crack easily if you hit it the wrong way... the power brick is larger than i thought ( i guess i've gotten spoiled with how small the Air adaptor is now...)\n\noh - for some reason you can't sleep the unit while the SD is in.  every time i woke up the unit (it does wake up fast btw), it complains i have to be careful not to take out the SD without ejecting (or something along these lines)\n\nok - i hope that covers a lot of different moving parts.  again, I know a Chromebook is not meant to be compared against a MacBook -i just had a raw wake up call where those extra dollars go... I hope it helps someone make their decision.  that said, it's very promising what this platform will do a few years from now - just give it time!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "I originally bought this chromebook as a secondary device that was lightweight and easy to take back and forth to school.  It fulfills that extremely well, and also has surprised me in some aspects that make this device much more impressive. Anyone concerned about productivity on this device has some valid concerns, but I'll explain how to alleviate almost everything. I'll also try to compare this as much as possible to the Acer c720, since some people seemed to be torn between both of them as they both have similar specs and price points.\n\nPros:\n-Lightweight\n-Low Powered, Fast CPU\n-Long Battery Life\n-Solid State Hard Drive\n-Great Build Quality\n-Good App selection\n-Versatility and Portability\n\nCons:\n-No traditional computer programs available\n-Not a traditional OS\n-Only wireless printing available\n-Will not be able to play 3D games, such as minecraft (even on Ubuntu)\n\nHere's a dissected review on points I think are important.\n\nBUILD QUALITY\nThe build quality is very good for a cheap computer.  The laptop feels very well put together.  The keyboard has a good \"snap\" to it and has really good resistance, doesn't feel cheap at all.  The trackpad is nice and big, and doesn't interfere at all while typing.  It isn't nearly as good as the touchpad on a Macbook for instance, but it certainly doesn't disappoint.  The white color definitely adds a sense of style that the Acer c720 doesn't have.  It's also thinner than the c720 and weighs less.  It's a very sturdy, well put together device.\n\nBATTERY LIFE\nThe battery life on this chromebook is probably the best you're going to get.  It uses a 2.16 GHZ \"bay trail\" celeron processor with the atom architecture, which was actually initially designed for use in mobile devices such as cell phones. In my opinion, the coolest thing about this processor is it doesn't get too hot.  This chromebook doesn't even need to use a fan because the processor simply doesn't get hot no matter how hard you push it.  The lack of a fan and the power needed to run the processor is less than the Acer c720, meaning the battery life will be higher.  While using it, I get about 10-12 hours of battery life while browsing or word processing. If I'm watching videos or playing a game, or doing more media intensive things, I'll get around 8-10 hours. Fantastic experience, my Macbook Pro can't compete against that.\n\nDISPLAY\nLet's be honest, this display is not very good.  However, for a cheap screen I think it's decent.  The viewing angles are poor and it's not always easy to see the entire screen. When watching a dark movie or TV show it's overly apparent how hard it is to get the screen angle just right.  This isn't really a deal-breaker for me because at less than $200 I wasn't really concerned about the screen quality.  It has an HDMI output though and a pretty good graphics processor, it will display things in HD quality when connected to a television or computer monitor and play videos and other media extremely well. The c720 has a similar display.\n\nPROCESSING POWER\nThe processing power is very good for the price point.  As stated earlier, it uses a 2.16 Ghz \"bay-trail\" celeron processor, which is plenty of power to do everything you can with chrome OS.  However, the specs on the CPU are somewhat confusing.  In simple terms, the Acer c720 has a clock speed of 1.4 Ghz, but it uses a \"haswell\" celeron processor.  This processor was originally made for desktop computers while the bay-trail processor was originally made for mobile devices.  The haswell processor in the Acer c720 is faster than the bay-trail processor in the Acer CB3-111.  You will be able to notice this when loading large, graphically intensive files or webpages.  I also notice it when typing into the address bar in the web browser, the processor simply can't keep up with the keystrokes.  The processor in the c720 comes at a price though, it needs a fan to cool it because it can get hot, which adds a little more weight and size to the device and it uses more power to operate the fan.\n\nThis may be a deal breaker to some people, but I'm impressed with the smaller size and a little extra battery life the CB3-111 provides over the raw processing power of the c720.  The CB3-111 is still a very fast chromebook, it just isn't as fast in some scenarios as the c720.\n\nHowever, the graphics processor in the CB3-111 is pretty impressive.  It plays videos on YouTube and Netflix flawlessly.  No hiccups, no long load times, very fast and efficient experience.\n\nSOUND\nDecent.  Speakers sound crisp and clean, but are relatively quiet. If sound is important to you, look into purchasing a good bluetooth speaker.  It's a worthwhile investment.\n\nOPERATING SYSTEM\nAll chromebooks use chrome OS, a modified version of linux built by google.  It's so simple anyone can use it, and that's probably its greatest strength.\n\nIf anyone wants to know what chrome OS is, download chrome browser and try to use your computer only using that browser.  You can go to the web-store and add any app you want and run it.  This is exactly what chrome OS is, an operating system built to run the chrome browser only, with a simple file manager to manage downloadable files until you upload is to Google drive or another cloud service.  It isn't made to hold a large amount of files and programs on the hard drive, which is actually a very good thing if you want to keep the computer fast.  There is nothing you have to do to keep the computer optimized, it will always be optimized from the moment you receive it.\n\nOnly gripe I have with chrome OS is it doesn't do everything I need it to do.  For example, although google docs is good enough to work in class for taking notes, it simply can't do everything Microsoft Word can. Additionally, even if you save a Google Doc file in a Microsoft word format, it won't always come out looking the same.  It's the exact same problem when opening a Microsoft Word file in the Google Doc format.  It's a little confusing on how to get some things working, and some things you think should be a relatively simple addition aren't included (like adding columns, despite there being a work around to get columns).  Also sometimes I need to use a better word processor so when a teacher uploads my paper after I submit it, it'll look the exact same on their computer as it does in mine.  I feel like this is very important for research papers, or projects that have to look the exact same no matter where you open it.  Google docs isn't quite there yet, but is certainly good enough for about 90% of my processing needs.  Despite this not being good enough for me, it is probably good enough for most people.\n\nADVANCED STUFF\nIf you want something more out of your chromebook and are concerned about it just not being enough, you're in luck. This in my opinion simply makes it the best computer you can buy.\n\nThis is an intel based chromebook, so Ubuntu or another linux operating system of your choice runs extremely well on it and has full app compatibility.  It's faster than chrome OS in most tasks, and has a much more traditional OS layout that matches a more Windows or OSX interface.  However, using linux is not that intuitive to use.  You'd have to be prepared to learn a whole new operating system, which takes some getting used to because of its use of the command line.  It's very useful to be able to switch between environments very quickly to accomplish tasks I can't necessarily accomplish with chrome OS. It's also nice being able to use a wired printer.\n\nIf you're a tech savvy individual, it might be worth it to you to give a Linux platform a shot.  Libreoffice is a free, full office productivity suite that's extremely similar to Microsoft Office and is updated constantly.  GIMP is an image editor that is considered a free, full alternative to Photoshop. Just plug in external storage to the USB drive and you're good to go, edit photos and documents to your hearts content.  There are tools available that can run both OS's simultaneously, so you can switch back and forth whenever you want just by pushing a few keys.\n\nCONCLUSION\nThis is an extremely good device for under $200.  It has a lot of versatility and portability that make it a good buy in any scenario you're going to use it in.  I'm very satisfied with my purchase.\n\nIf you're on the fence between the CB3-111 and c720, it boils down to two things, battery life and performance:\nIf performance is more important for you, pick the c720.\nIf battery life is more important to you, pick the CB3-111.\n\nIn my opinion, you'd be very happy with either purchase."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "I normally don't buy low end computers, but I ended up getting this so I could connect to my Chromecast and cast videos/photos etc. to it.  I m surprised to say I'm shocked on how good this Chromebook is in terms of use and possible replacement to a laptop.\n\nFirst thing you need to know is I want to say majority of the functionality of this chromebook is dependent on you being connected to the internet.  At first this turned me off on getting a chromebook, but then I thought about it and I was like well, that's the same thing as my gaming laptop.  If I didn't have internet I would only be able to type essays or spreadsheet etc.  I can write an email without being online...hmm wait this is starting to sound like a regular laptop.  So anyways, that's what my first impression of this was.\n\nNote:  The Chromebook is essentially the Chrome browser.  In reality, you could just install the Chrome Launcher on a Windows/Apple computer and you just made your own chromebook.  Most people who buy this are buying it for the portability and an extra extension of the computer.\n\nPROS:\n-The battery life is simply amazing\n-No fan on the bottom but it never really gets hot at the bottom at all\n-Google Remote Desktop:  Essentially you connect to your computer at home and use it on the chromebook.  I love this feature a lot since I sometimes need more Microsoft Excel capabilities than the Microsoft Excel Online provides.  Yes, Microsoft Office does work on Chromebooks.  Basic functionality on the browser tab, full functionality when you Google Remote Desktop.\n-Keyboard is extremely responsive.  I can type really fast and after the browser settles in, it registers every letter immediately when I press it.\n-No viruses (yet).  Of course in the future there will be, but at this time, it's really really impossible to get a virus on the Chrome OS.\n-Always up to date\n-Free Google Cloud storage for 2 years\n-Free GoGo sessions on airplanes (limit # of times though I believe)\n-While there are laptops at $199.99 or $299.99, this does it better because of no fan noise since there isn't one.\n-My friend's 8 month old banged on the keyboard and started playing it like a piano  My chromebook is something I don't need to worry about because it's so low priced and it sustains itself WELL.  I was shocked.\n-SD card slot (wish it was micro)\n-Sound is surprisingly decent.  Not the best, but it resonates well.\n-HDMI port and charging port on the back. Really like this placement instead of on the side.\n-Trackpad is NICE.  Great responsiveness with 2 finger swipes and all.  I was very surprised by the responsiveness.  It's like the Apple's trackpad, even the 2 finger tap to right click.\n-Benefits TREMENDOUSLY with Chromecast\n\nNEGATIVES:\n\n-Initial lag when opening a document or etc. but then it subsides; unless you have a ton of browser tabs open.\n-The viewing angles are horrible.  But this is expected considering what type of screen it uses.\n-Feels like if you push the screen back, it'll snap since it's made out of plastic.  But plastic is stronger than people think.  I mean look at Costco water, it's in plastic.  It can hold that weight!\n-Can't install software and run them offline.\n-Extremely internet dependent\n-SD card sticks out.\n-Camera quality is noisy, but expected at this price point.\n-Can't see the screen in the sun\n-Screen feels grainy compared to my UHD screens, but it's because of the screen it uses.  I'm spoiled =P\n\nAll in all, I decided to keep it.  The portability, the no fan noise, the low price I don't have to worry about it like my gaming laptop, the security.  What's not to like?  Only thing I would change?  The screen."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "This review probably best used by folks familiar with CBs.\nMy c710 lasted maybe 2 years before it died - I suspect power supply issues but am still troubleshooting it. Meanwhile I needed a CB and picked this one up.\nPROS - really fast wifi (ac) and processing speed as long as you only have 2-3 tabs open. Much lighter in weight, crisp clean graphics. Love the power cord in the back. SUPER battery life. SOund is MUCH better than the c710 but still has upper level throttle. I like the fan-less built in eMMC16G storage better than the 320G HD, as I tend to use this all day on my lap, and use google drive to store my graphics files.\nCONS - I had upgraded my c710 with 4 more G RAM and found to my dismay you cannot upgrade this unit. More than a few tabs open and the processor locks up and crashes constantly. Spending more time with the task mgr than I would like .Less connectivity options as just an hdmi connector, 2 USBs, and an sd card reader.  Sound is whimsical as to when it will work. The keyboard has issues in terms of shortcuts working as specified in layout provided at crtl+alt+?... Since this has the solid state drive I don't think you can retro fit this with LINUX o/s if you are so inclined like you can with the c710.\nMEH - trackpad is different but seems ok, sometimes lags in responsiveness regardless of tweaks in settings"}

Being that my Gateway XP laptop I had was no longer supported I was getting so overwhelmed with updates and virus alerts and weird stuff, doing anything on the internet was getting way too unworkable. Just plain no fun. Going from that former frustration to this Acer Chromebook is 180 degree difference! Light as a feather and totally workable. Love the solid keyboard as I write this. It's helpful to understand that this, or any, Chromebook, even though it looks like a \"laptop,\" it is basically an internet device, or an \"intertop.\" This may be obvious, but having come from a Windows laptop there is a difference.  Computer-time is so fast...in the past years laptops were the small, light, and portable computers. Now, they seem heavy compared to this light cloud-based internet device that happens to look like a laptop. I feel lighter and freer with this thing. In this age for day-to-day email and web activity a Chromebook makes a lot of sense. And for me this particular Acer CB is just wonderful!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "I got this laptop to replace a 13 inch macbook that was about 5-8 years old, and I've been pretty happy so far. The web browsing is mostly faster, but I've noticed if I have the music app open (which opens in a browser) that web browsing is significantly slower. The laptop also requires a reboot more often than the macbook did. But the battery life is fantastic compared to any laptop I've used, I regularly get 8-10 hours out of it with light use on dim lighting. I'm normally very picky about keyboards too, and I haven't had any of the issues the other reviews reported. I did notice in the settings that you can change the search button back to caps locks if you'd prefer. One odd thing I did notice is that the trackpad behaves slightly differently than mac, like your fingers need to be further apart when doing a double click on chrome. Took a bit of getting used to, but it wasn't a big deal.\n\nI've been surprised that this is able to handle torrents perfectly with JSTorrent, and the browser extension. With the extension you can just right click on a magnet link and add it to your client, works great with the pirate bay. It can also stream music, movies, tv etc from your media server with Plex. I also have VNC working great, I'm able to SSH to other computers, and even FTP/SCP stuff. The chrome store also highlights a lot of great sites online such as clip champ which allows you to transcode video without downloading or installing anything.\n\nIt can't run basically anything you'd need to install though, such as games or even simple ruby apps for managing EC2 nodes. One really annoying flaw too is that you must be signed into google to listen to your music, so if you want to sign into your work email that also uses gmail you basically need to stop listening to music for a bit. I was also a bit surprised when I got an invite to google inbox, only to find out that I can't use it without an upgraded phone. It seems like having a chromebook should also qualify you for being able to use inbox."}

I've been using Mac for about 12 years now, and absolutely despise using Windows based machines. However, the downside to Apple products has always been the prices.\n\nAfter my beloved Macbook bit the dust a few months ago, I had to find a replacement. Being on a tight budget, I knew it would take me a while to save up for a new Mac, so I started looking through some affordable options to get me by, allowing me to do basic internet and computer tasks. I had never really thought about or considered a Chromebook, but I knew I would be unhappy with a regular PC, and the reviews were great, so I decided to give it a shot. I am so glad I did!\n\nThe Chrome OS IS different, but I think it is a pretty easy transition from Mac to Chrome. It's simple to use and runs smoothly. Everything I hate about Windows is missing, and I can accomplish just about everything I need to pretty easily.\n\nI love that it runs silently, and that it starts up almost instantly. The keyboard is nice, very similar to the one I'm used to, and I like the trackpad - being used to a multi-touch trackpad on my Macbook, this one is familiar and welcome, and I much prefer it to buttons! The screen is nice - a good brightness and I like the matte finish.\n\nPages load pretty quickly and I can open multiple tabs without issues.\n\nThe speakers sound surprisingly good, given the size! I was impressed with that.\n\nMy only complaints are that I wish I could use Skype and iTunes. Google Play Music is fine and I do like it, I just wish I could access all of the music I have in the iTunes cloud! Skype is my preferred messenger, and you can access the web version of it for chatting, but I'd like the functionality of an app.\n\nThose are very minor complaints, though, and I see myself using this Chromebook for it's portability even after I replace my full computer. I definitely recommend it to anyone who needs a simple, functional way to use the internet!"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "This is a fine Chromebook for the money, and a nice, if small, upgrade from the Acer C720, which I also own. The white finish is visually appealing, and its contrast with the colors of the screen makes the screen seem a bit larger, though of course it's the same size. The screen is also visibly richer in color than on the C720. The AC jack has been moved from the side of the machine to the back, which I think works better. This one is about 5 ounces lighter than the C720, enough to make a noticeable difference when carrying it around. The processor is a better one as well, though I can't say I noticed much difference in performance; the Chromebook is already fast enough that added speed is probably measured in very small increments. My only complaint about this machine vs. the C720 is that this one takes slightly longer to reconnect to the Internet when I open the lid. It's still a matter of seconds, so hardly a major issue, but it does mean the loss of the \"open it, click immediately\" feel of the C720.\n\nSetting aside comparisons and speaking generally, I'm happy with this Chromebook. The battery life is great. I'm the type who forgets to plug things back in even when they're sitting next to the adapter, and I hardly ever get \"please plug me in\" messages on this Chromebook. It also charges fast when you do plug it in. The speakers are strong considering the size and cost; I've gotten less impressive sound from full laptops with much higher costs. The cramped keyboard is an adjustment if you're used to a full-sized laptop layout, but once you get used to it, it gets to seem normal and it'll be the laptop that feels wrong-sized and awkward. My only regret is the absence of separate touchpad buttons (I'm not good at two-finger tapping) and dedicated page up/page down keys (a two-button shortcut just isn't as naturally when scrolling through something). But those are pretty small trade-offs for a cheaper, faster device that covers most casual computing needs. Despite coming in at the low end of Chromebook pricing, the Acer 11 CB3-111-C670 is a quality machine, well worth considering for those new to Chromebooks."}

I ordered on Thursday relieved on Saturday and started using on Monday! IT's just like using my phone, but a lot faster and bigger! LOL  I love the fact I can download apps (looks like only from Google tho). It charged fast, I currently have 78% charge left as we speak. Working with my WiFi it moves pretty fast though websites. I'm learning how to work it efficiently since controls and tabs are not like your normal laptop. Day one of usage and Im happy! Now to find a protector for it, this white will be dirty fast!"}

I opened it to make sure they work properly before I gift them to the kids on Christmas and have issues. They are light weight and compact, it could literally fit in my handbag. The kids will love it, I'm more excited to give it to them than anything. I was lucky and got them while they were still on sale for $179, I see now they are $199 so I'm happy I purchased when I did. I would definitely recommend this chromebook to others. Thanks to Prime shipping I got it in 2 days which really added to the experience!"}

I cant believe how little it weighs. Its also incredibly thin, no bulk at all.\nHas everything I usually need, including mail, browser and creating documents.\nPerfect for travel! I really look forward to leaving the bulky and heavy laptop at home next trip.\nIt doesn't heat up, as in no heat at all. Much nicer for laptop computing!\nThe battery life is phenomenal! I haven't once had to be tethered to a cord while using it.\nAutomatic back-ups! I don't have to remember to do a thing, and no lost documents.\nInstant on, no waiting! When Im ready to compute, Chromebooks ready. Just sign in.\nNo updating, no waiting! its all in the Cloud. Heavenly! Twiddling thumbs saved.\nNo more glare! The matte screen is an eye-saver at night when the lights are on in the house. ery\nNice keyboard and very responsive touch-pad.\nUnbelievable price! Add it to your shopping list for very useful and affordable gifts for everyone.\n\nDid I say no waiting? That is my favorite feature of all -- next to no weight!\n\nI haven't found anything to not like. My only little minor irritant is that I'm so used to a touchscreen that I keep trying to touch the screen. No touchscreen, of course, but I'll get over that in time.\n\nI wasn't really in the market for a Chromebook. I don't know why, but it just hadnt caught my eye.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "I've had about a week with this little computer now, and so far I love it. I have a desktop Mac for more heavy-duty software, but for on-the-go document editing and web browsing, the chromebook is working like a champ.\n\nI actually switched to this one from the Samsung chromebook, because I wanted to have the Intel processor. Honestly, I don't think there's that much difference between this one with the Intel chip and the Samsung with its ARM processor. Both have decent processing speeds, both can run multiple browser tabs without trouble, and both have great battery life -- although, in the battery department, the Acer wins by about 2 hours (I get about 8 hours of run time vs. the Samsung's 6).\n\nAs another reviewer noted, the screen on the Acer is a little darker than you may be used to on a regular laptop, but I'm not a huge fan of really bright screens anyway. I run the brightness level at about halfway on the Acer, and it's comfortable for me all day.\n\nBuild quality is nice and solid; while the Samsung was a feather or two lighter, it also had a creaky feel to it. The Acer has no creak; you can pick it up by one side and not feel like the plastic's flexing under your fingers. The keyboard has a nice feel to it, and is quieter than the Samsung's.\n\nOverall, a really nice computer, and a great replacement for my heavy old dinosaur laptop."}

Brand new out of the box my Netbook was snail slow and a disaster to navigate. This baby is lightning fast and has just about everything you could possibly need.\n\nFor those who are also new to Chromebooks, you could think of it as a Google tablet, but with the attached keyboard like your typical laptop. It runs entirely on Google software, so no Windows! This may limit some of your software interests, but again you can't exactly think of this as a laptop. It's designed to run lightning fast, access the internet, your basic apps, send e-mail, edit documents, and that's about it. There's not a lot of hard drive space, but Google provides 100gb of free Google Drive storage so it's really no big deal.\n\nAs someone who writes a lot of reviews, edits a lot of documents and writes essays for school, this is EXACTLY what I need. A no-nonsense, spyware free, unnecessary programs free, computer that has a full-sized keyboard attached. I can access the internet on it faster than I can on my desktop. It's unbelievable.\n\nThe current Amazon price is $179 which I think is an absolute steal. I paid $300 for a Dell netbook which, like I say, was worthless right out of the box. If awkward typing on tablets is a problem for you, this is your answer. It's crazy slim, super accessible, lightning fast, and void of all the junk that Windows lapbooks and netbooks are loaded with. I'm so happy, I can't stop talking about it. Highly, highly recommended!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "First let me say this is my first Chromebook, coming from traditional Windows and Linux based laptops, my trusty Dell D430 running Linux Mint recently became riddled with issues and the cost to upgrade wasn't worth it based on what a typical Chromebook was going for.  Since the primary use for this is surfing the Web, YouTube, online Banking and etc, that is no games or high demand applications and to go out and buy a more powerful and expensive notebook for these needs, felt like a major waste of money and being a fan of Linux stability and the benefits of using it, I was swayed towards Chrome OS and waited for it to develop.  Now seeing it was the time, I began my search for a Chromebook that would meet my needs.\n\nI had several Chromebooks in my Wishlist, the newer Toshiba and Samsung models both in the 13.3 with HD and Full HD, was also keeping the older and respected Acer C720 (Haswell) in mind since it was priced right and had great reviews.  I had a budget, did not really see the point in spending $300+ on a Chromebook and was not sure if I really needed 1080P on a 13.3\" screen or if it was really a benefit?  I also was leery of a Glossy screen since I always used Matte screens, granted the richer colors and deeper blacks would be an advantage and larger screens also tend to eat more battery life and I always preferred Matte screens regardless.\n\nSo after some debating I made the decision to go with the CB3, not knowing if it would be as good as the C720, but reading it was fan less and a tad lighter, gave me greater interest and while there are some negative reviews on the Baytrail vs the Haswell CPU with regards to performance, I really never push it to the extent of these benchmark tests and rarely have more than 2 tabs open.  So to me it was not a big deal and I feel bench marking in general is subjective and most general users will not notice much of a difference in speed.\n\nAfter arriving, the set-up was a breeze, no more waiting to install updates or service packs and countless drivers.  Boot time is super fast, a few seconds and once open the screen and it comes on automatically, and the build quality of the CB3 is excellent and I really like the clean Matte White look of the housing, not a glossy fingerprint magnet at all. The keyboard is excellent and the CB3 in general, feels like a much more expensive notebook.  The battery came with 80% charge and after allowing it to fully charge I noticed 8.5 hours left on the fuel gauge.\n\nAlso take note that the keyboard is somewhat different than a typical notebook with Windows or Mac, there is no dedicated Delete key and no F1 and etc.  Chromebooks use shortcut keys to do these functions, and this takes time to learn.\n\nExample:\n\nCtrl+Backspace Delete the previous word\nAlt+Backspace Delete the next letter (forward delete)\n\nThere is a list out there if you do a search for \"Chromebook Keyboard Shortcuts\", if your a longtime Windows user, it might be good to print these out and keep them handy till you learn them or you can also press \"Ctrl+Alt+?\" to see the list pop-up on your screen.\n\nThere isn't much in the box, a thin set-up sheet, warranty and a external PSU which is White as well.\n\nThe display is how I expected, nice but still a little washed out looking on certain colors, blacks are definitely not too deep but it's not horrible.\n\nI was somewhat unsure if I would like a smaller screen size, seeing my Dell D430 was 12.1\", but it wasn't too bad after using it for a few hours.\n\nNo IPS display at this price, but I had no issues once I got the screen adjusted, but I can see why IPS screens have their advantages.\n\nIt takes two hands typically to open the display as the unit is very light and opening the screen alone with your fingers is not possible, maybe in time as the hinge breaks in but for now it's a two handed affair, one hand to hold it down the other to open.\n\nI decided to stream some Netflix and after installing the App/Link not that you need to install it just basically a short-cut, it worked excellent, no issues at all and the speakers exceeded my expectations, I was very impressed with the sound quality from a sub $200 notebook, the biggest plus was Zero fan noise, should say there is no fan or need for it, so that's a plus for the Baytrail CPU.  As well their was minimal to no heat coming from the CB3, after streaming Netflix for about 1 hour, I checked my battery to see I still had over 8:15 hours left and this was after 1 hour of initial web browsing and etc.  Not that I plan to watch Netflix on this all the time or was it the reason I bought it, but knowing it can handle it and still give a quality image and sound is a major plus.\n\nIt does work for Amazon Video on Demand, but HD videos are not available, your forced to watch SD.  So for that I'll be sticking to Netflix and when I need to pay for something, Google Play, which works flawless.\n\nTried the webcam, it works but I really did not judge it too much or have much use for it, along with other features, Microphone, HDMI, USB 2.0 and 3.0 and SD slot though they are there and useful.\n\n16GB of Storage, again for me this is fine as I do not plan on using this for anything else other than what I previously stated.  Also Google gives you 100GB of Cloud Storage for 2 years if you want it.\n\nThe WiFi worked well and while I have an older WiFi Router, which doesn't take advantage of 802.11 ac, it's nice to have for future proofing and something that is missing on the C720 series.\n\nNow on to a few gripes I noticed, granted I'm still getting getting comfortable with it and not use to this style of touch pad, all my other notebooks used separate buttons for the mouse function, not one integrated touch pad.  Also I'm still learning how to copy and paste on a Chromebook which requires a two finger press, so I think in time I will learn this, but I have found the touch pad in general to be somewhat difficult initially to use.  As well the sound of the \"Click\" is quite loud and very tactile, granted these tend to break in with time, to be fair I'm not use to it and it's kinda loud with respect to my old Dell D430 or other external mice I have used, so I might switch to a external moue if it does not grow on me with time.\n\nThe power adapter, coming from traditional notebooks which have a beefy power plug, I found the one on this Chromebook to be very tiny and I'm sure it's a standard for most but it does not feel very robust and noticed it did not fully seat with ease when plugged in and was not charging till I pressed it in with more force.  Granted again, it's new and will become easier in time.  I also felt a little uneasy on how it protrudes out and seems like it could get easily damaged when plugged in due to excessive strain.  Time will tell, but I hope to never have this plugged in while using it.\n\nThe headphone jack is on the right side, now not a big issue but if you do decide to use wired headphones and a mouse at the same time, you may find this an issue, though seeing this has Bluetooth capability, wireless headphones would eliminate this.\n\nAside from that, I am very impressed with the CB3 and while I originally purchased it from Amazon for $199.99, a day after I received it the price dropped to $179.99, knowing Amazon's pricing guarantee, I immediately contacted Customer Service and got my account credited for the difference, cannot beat that at all which further exceeded my expectations.\n\nI will soon also getting a pair of Wireless Bluetooth Headphones, the internal Bluetooth option is very nice and I might as well utilize it.\n\nI'm very happy with this Chromebook and for the price I find very little to complain about, it cost less than my latest Unlocked Smartphone purchase and will meet my needs for now."}

I was really excited to buy a chromebook after I spent a good amount of time researching them and watching other reviews on youtube, (something I like to do before I buy something). Just to give a very quick overview of what a chromebook is, which is easy to make simple: They are very light-weight laptops, running off a solid state drive (usually aruond 16gig or 32gig). Chrome OS is the light environment, which I fell in love with. No more of all the crap widows tries to sell. No more viruses, AND you can run Ubuntu or other light Linux dsitros along side Chrome OS with a simple key command to change. It is extremely easy and quick to install Linux, just by searching a tutorial on Youtube it took less than an hour. With Ubuntu running offline I can have access to LibreOffice Writer and all the amazing free applications Linux offers. Okay enough about Linux because I could brag about how much I love that too forever. I just want to add in that I absolutely love the direction Google is going with Chrome OS and how it is presented in the Chromebooks. I am very impressed. For the money spent, these are very well built machines inside and out.\nA lot of people reviewed the c720 as feeling a little cheap and I cant say that about the cb3-111. I was looking at a C720 tonight at the store and it did feel somewhat cheaper feeling compared to this one. The keyboard just feels very nice to type with, has a  nice subtle sound and the whole over feel of the acer in my lap is a wonderful experience. I really think this is the best technology device that Ive ever bought for the price it is. I do everything on this thing!, (given that I am not a software writer or programer) Everytime I go on the google appstore I find something new that amazes me that I wouldnt ever imagine I could do with it.\nThis particular model has only 2 gigs ram, and only 16 gig solid state drive, with expandable sd card reader. I would have liked to have a little more solid state space. Ive come to accept the low space and gigs of ram. The processor is very good, (the new intel dual i3) which is what I think makes it do what it can do.\nPROS: FAST!, Light weight, long battery, (over 8 hours), Nice feeling keyboard and trackpad, Anti-glare screen, and I think it just looks very good and stylish.\nCONS: I cant think of any cons except that you cant store much on the only 16gig ssd.\nFYI: Do not touch the screen, it is a nightmare for fingerprints. Keep clean with special cleaning cloths. Thats it.\n\nOver all it is a really great experience to type on. I wish I had this in high-school. Very nice for research. Comfy to set in lap. Very fun to explore with. I will be buying another one when they come out with the bigger better series. AND I will def be checking out what else Acer has to offer. They are really showing innovation that is impressive."}

You have to put in your gmail acount information when turning it on for the first time, but there's also an option to browse as guest. It's quick to turn on, and besides the Google Chrome internet, has icons for Gmail, Google search, Google Docs, and You tube.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "This is my first ever Chromebook and I must say I am enjoying using this little laptop immensely. There's much to like about a Chromebook; it runs on Google's operating system, it boots up very, very quickly, and it's small enough and light enough to carry around the house, to work, or even on vacation.\n\nIt literally took me less than one minute to have the Chromebook up and running once I took it out of the box. The Chromebook easily found my WiFi connection and, once I signed in with my Google account, everything synced perfectly.\n\nOf course working in the Chromebook environment is very different than working on a typical Windows desktop or laptop computer. While is is certainly possible to work offline, and to use a number of the apps offline, you really need to be connected to the Internet to store documents in the cloud. Google has a number of products that mirror popular Microsoft Office products: Google Docs is Word, Google Sheet is Excel, and Google Slides is PowerPoint. You can open documents in the Office related formats or as a PDF, so opening the documents on other computers are not a problem. Additionally, Google has thousands of apps for games, utilities, office-related products, etc., in the Chrome Web store.\n\nLooking for a \"save\" button in Google Docs? You won't find one. The computer automatically saves a version of your document in the cloud. The good news is that your documents are always available, and hopefully, secure, in the cloud, from any computer, mobile device, etc. Dragging a copy of a document onto your desktop will not save it to your computer's hard drive. You can download it in various formats, and, although I have not tried it yet, I imagine you can download it to a memory card or stick.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, the Acer Chromebook has a 2.16 GHz Intel Celeron processor, 2 GB RAM, and a 16 GB hard drive. The computer has ports for HDMI, a memory card, and USB 2.0 and 3.0. It measures 11.77 x 7.95 x 0.73 inches and weights on 2.4 pounds. The battery is rated to last 8.5 hours. The best feature of all, for me, is that it boots up in about 10 seconds. Google is also offering 100 GB free cloud storage, but I have not tried to see if I am eligible for that yet.\n\nThe screen of the Acer Chromebook measures 11.6 inches. While not the sharpest or most colorful screen, it works fine for basic Internet usage, such as YouTube, or general computer activities. I have no problem working on documents or using the keyboard and built-in mousepad.\n\nThis is not a computer for doing heavy video editing or other RAM intensive activities, but for basic access to the web, email, document creation and editing, presentations and spreadsheets, it performs really, really well. And, with thousands of apps to choose from in Chrome Store, there's enough to keep anyone entertained. The processor is quick and once you get use to the Chrome operating system, the computer is easy to use. Given the price (cheaper than many tablets) and features, I would highly recommend this."}

Running the latest Celeron Bay Trail processor and with Wireless AC, the Acer Chromebook 11 can handle websites, Chrome apps, and Google apps, mostly with ease. The 2gb of RAM does bog the machine down a little. There have been several times I have been quicker to type and get moving than the computer can process. The all day battery life makes up for any disappointment, however.\n\nGoogle Docs, Sheets, and Slides, along with Google Drive, are competent replacements for Microsoft Office for many, if not most, users. Popular websites like Mint, Pulse, Evernote, Feedly, all have Chrome Apps. And you can easily play Angry Birds or Bejeweled.\n\nI bought this Chromebook as a toy, as I am convinced very few people actually need Windows any more -- get Chromebooks, Chromeboxes, or iPads on the low-to-mid end, and Apple laptops and desktops on the mid-to-high end. When you factor in not needing antivirus on these machines, the little maintenance you need to do on these machines... well, why would you Windows unless you need the latest games on release day?"}

There are a couple issues with it...issues that could be dealbreakers for some users (the big one: wifi...see below).  But overall, for me, the good far outweighs the bad.\n\nFirst, the good:\n\n+ Great look and feel.  I was concerned that white plastic would look kind of cheap and unprofessional.  Those concerns were quickly put to rest.  This feels great to use and carry around.  They keyboard is nice, too.  Not cramped in any way.\n\n+ Quick startup.  It really takes under 8 seconds to power up.  That's 8 seconds from completely-shut-down to ready-to-log-in.  It's even quicker (roughly 1 second) if you are simply waking it from sleep (like, when you open the lid).  It's so nice to go from \"I need to send an e-mail\" to actually typing it in under 10 seconds.  The only quicker way I know is with a tablet computer.\n\n+ Peppy.  This is not a computer for doing CPU-intensive work, such as video editing.  But as a device for web access, e-mail, and document editing (all via Google, of course), it performs beautifully.\n\n+ Quiet.  No moving parts means this is dead silent.\n\nNow, two problems, the first which might convince you to look elsewhere for your next computer:\n\n- Wifi connectivity issues.  In my home, where roughly a dozen devices routinely connect to wifi without an issue, this Acer had trouble getting connected.  I got an error message that suggested that the Chromebook was unable to find the network.  Yet, there it was, working on all my other devices.  After rebooting the computer, it seemed to be ok.  BUT EVEN MORE SIGNIFICANTLY: We use enterprise-level wifi configurations where I work.  I could NOT figure out how to connect to my work wifi to this Chromebook.  Whereas my other devices can connect to my work wifi with just a username and password, the Chromebook asks a lot of advanced-level classes I know nothing about.  So far, no luck.  But I really got this for home use, so the enterprise wifi configurations are not a big deal for me.\n\n- The screen is bright enough, but the colors are rather washed out.  Whites are off-wight, and browns are kind of muted.\n\nIf enterprise-implemented wifi is important to you, you might find yourself disappointed in this Acer Chromebook.  However, wifi at home seems to be fine after the initial setup."}

Many of you will ask why would I replace a chromebook with an IPS display with this one? Simple. While the Toshiba indeed has a great screen, 1080 for me on a 13 inch laptop is too much for my eyes. I have to scale everything up, so there was no real point in the bump in resolution. By downgrading I saved a good chunk of money and have a lighter weight better performing machine with better battery life.\n\nThe Acer performs better than the Toshiba Chromebook 2 and I suppose the reason for this is the difference in screen resolution. With the Acer, I am getting the rated 8.5 hours. With the Toshiba, I was only getting 6.5 hours tops. This is a well built machine, with good battery life, good performance and a decent screen. This is an overall much better machine than the C720.\n\nPros\nLight: At 2.4 pounds it is light weight\nGood build quality\nDecent Screen(much better than C720 and Asus C200\nDecent Sound and Volume\nGood Performance\nGood keyboard\nGreat trackpad\nBattery life: 8.5 hours as advertised\n\nCons\nFor $200 there really isn't any I have found. Could it perform a little better? Sure."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "I suffer from a serious neurotic problem where I must compulsively check in online with the Amazon Vine program at ridiculously  short intervals to see if they are offering me any free computer equipment to review, which up to now has kept me tied to my desktop PC's. My boss at work has already hired a potential replacement for me, and besides neglecting so much housework and automotive maintenance at home, I was spending WAY too much money on adult diapers.\n\nThank goodness Amazon Vine provided me with this lightweight portable Acer Chromebook 11 to review.\n\nFor $200 this unit is amazing. My only previous experience along these lines was a little Acer netbook running Windows XP that I bought back in early 2009. I paid $250 for that and all I can say is it was slow to boot up and  painfully, mind-numbingly slow on the internet. Now I flip this Chromebook open and in about 10 seconds I can be on the internet checking for Vine freebies. It comes fully on darn near instantly, then navigates the internet from there as quickly as any computer I ever used. It links up with the wifi at my home or my dad's place with no issues whatsoever, so now I'm free to roam around the house and use the toilet or eat in the kitchen with my wife and kids or whatever. The battery life is longer than any rechargeable device of any kind I've ever owned or used... I turn it on and off, on and off, and basically it lasts all day long. I also note that this thing has no air vents anywhere yet stays amazingly cool at all times. My old netbook felt like it was going to catch on fire if I ever set it down on my bed for 5 minutes while on. This Chromebook also has entirely acceptable, if not great, speakers and a very nice keyboard feel. I only use it for browsing the internet, watching YouTube videos, and checking my e-mail, so I can't comment on any word-processing software or anything of that sort.\n\nAs far as bad points go, I'd have to say the screen is not as bright and colorful/pretty as I might wish for. It looks OK -- it is functional -- but viewing angle is a bit critical and I get the overall impression of looking at sharp images but through a thin fog. I assume this type screen has some advantage in reduced power consumption, or maybe it is just much less expensive to produce? Also the case is flat or matte white; I guess I'd prefer glossy blue or black myself, because I sometimes have greasy fingers when I'm in the garage checking for Vine freebies with one hand while taking bolts out of my transfer case with the other. I'd call it 4.5 stars, but for $200, and in light of the speed and problem-free operation, I think these minor gripes are acceptable in a practical device.\n\n-------------\n\nEdit, 4 months later:\n\nThis little computer is great! I have dozed off a few times and my wife or teenage daughters got hold of it, and they all love it too. Also when we have to go to a doctor appointment with our 2-year-old, this thing is a lifesaver for how it keeps her busy watching cartoons over the hospital wifi. It never fails to come on quick, and the battery life is still super. The way the touchpad works is just blows any previous laptop touchpad I've used out of the water. I've always felt they were such a poor substitute for a mouse, but this one leaves very little to be desired.\n\n-------------\n\n2 or 3 months more yet, and we still love this thing! One single time I think our 2.5 year old daughter pushed too many buttons at once and the screen froze up. It would not respond to any buttons, would not turn off, even the clock was stopped on a certain minute. But we just let the battery run down, recharged it in the morning, and everything was fine again! I see now the price for these has dropped to an amazingly low $155. I suppose eventually this will be discontinued to be replaced with an updated model that odds are will not work as good... I am sorely tempted to buy another one for my family while the getting is good, though we don't particularly need it.\n\n-------------\n\nOK, after having this thing a year and seeing the price drop to $150, I could not resist and bought TWO more of them for my family. We also have a much more costly Toshiba Chromebook that does have slightly better sound and a slightly sharper screen, but I prefer the physical shape and feel of this Acer. As far as practical value per dollar goes there is no contest... this Acer blows the Toshiba out of the water."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "The Acer Chromebook 11 is remarkable for the price- actually it is remarkable period!. I am not a computer professional. As I understand it the Acer Chromebook 11 is a bare bones type of computer- really for use with the internet. On looking over some of the other reviews, there are many things that a chrome book could do but given that I mostly use computers to go on the internet, this laptop is perfect for my needs. First of all, it is incredibly light. As light as my iPad. Therefore, it is great to travel with. It is small enough to pack away in a carryon. It runs on google software so you could play music, watch movies and get email without any difficulty. It takes photos, allows you to read books, and there is even a word processor. Battery life is excellent- longer than expected. My only complaint is that the keyboard does not light up making it difficult to work in low light. But what do you expect for $200. Actually, I wish I knew about this chrome book earlier. I would have insisted my daughter get one after her macbook crashed just before exams. It is less than the price of fixing her laptop.  I highly recommend this laptop."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "Was concerned that I would find this a joke after using Windows based PC and Notebooks for years but after only a short time with it, I find it does everything I need for on-line use and can use it at will staying off the desktop when full system and Windows features are not needed.\n\nPretty well done and so far have found no reason to worry about virus and Malware protection like my other systems.\nBoot it up and shut it down as I please without running other security programs etc.\n(will this change in the future if Chrome OS gets larger user base and more hackers get involved?  Who knows.. seems a certainty for the times to me)\n\nI've used USB 2 & 3 memory sticks and an external Seagate USB3 HDD with this so far without any problems.\n\nTouch pad is best feel & action I've found so far on a Notebook I've used, several options for it in the settings you will want to check on.  For me, I had to reset it to be less touchy.\n\nOne finger push same as left mouse click, two finger push is same as right mouse click.  one finger swipes moves cursor, two finger swipes will scroll up and down the pages.  Three finger swipe left or right to change open tabs...\n\nTrue, if you are used to Windows based machines you will find a few items about the keyboard that are different when you go to use them, but really nothing that can't be looked up and used when you are on the ChromeBook keyboard.\nI found the best thing for me was to use the \"?\" help key and go to the page that shows keyboard use, then save that page to the bookmark bar at the top of the browser page..  then it's quick and easy to click that to get fast info on what key combos do what with this CB3.\nOr if you want to see full screen keyboard overlay showing key assignments you can use Ctrl+Alt+? for that pop up\n\nI have yet to find any problem with computing power or speed with this CB3, it's quite impressive even when used to more powerful computers.  But then keep in mind that you are not running anything that requires much of the system either.  No software that need lots of CPU or video card power.\n\nWiFi connection has been fast and flawless so far...  one thing to keep in mind when reading about the super fast WiFi this has...  the fastest communications is with the new \"A C\" that this is capable of..  but, you also have to have one of the new \"AC\" capable routers to enjoy the full speed available to you with this ChromeBook version.  Fully backward compatible with older routers, but just not at the cutting edge speeds they offer in product description.\n\nThe only thing I've found so far that I wish was different is that the screen has somewhat limited viewing angles and on this one, I have to have the screen tilted a bit away from me at the top to see it properly for my eye.  Also it's a bit \"blue\" in it's white balance and could use a touch of red.\nSorry to say, you can change the brightness of the screen and resolution, but you can not get in there and change the color settings.\nMaximum screen resolution is 1366 x 768\n\nBattery really does last a long time and then charges very fast as well.\n\nBattery pack is not removable, memory is not expandable , SSD can't be increased in size  (by the average person at least)  After warranty period is up I'll have to look into that however.  IF I find it would be needed...  right now, can't see any use in wanting more of anything for what it was intended for.\n\nYou might want to look at the rest of the Acer Chromebook line if you do desire more up front, but you soon leave that lower price sweet spot this version offers and head more towards a full blown Notebook price.\nFor example;\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Acer-13-CB5-311-T9B0-Chromebook-13-3-inch-Full-HD-NVIDIA-Tegra-K1-2GB/dp/B00NC088EA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Acer 13 CB5-311-T9B0 Chromebook (13.3-inch Full HD, NVIDIA Tegra K1, 2GB)</a>\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Acer-Chromebook-13-CB5-311-T1UU-13-3-inch-Full-HD-NVIDIA-Tegra-K1-4GB/dp/B00MHX6TIA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Acer Chromebook 13 CB5-311-T1UU (13.3-inch Full HD, NVIDIA Tegra K1, 4GB)</a>\n\nI have had computers since the '80s buy I have never owned an Acer product before, but do know the brand has been around for a very long time, if this has been built by Acer,(not just branded) they have done well with the case,keyboard and screen which is all I can see and touch.\n  Only exception to that is the touch pad, the bottom left is down in the case a bit more than the other three corners (1/16 ish) so that you can feel the lip of the plastic case there.  Still works fine, just rubs your fingers when used and will sure be the dirt collection point on white case and pad.\n\nNo way to know what the motherboard looks like so can't comment on soldering or internal build other than it works well now and has some good Intel components in use.\n\nUpdate 2/2015;\n\nUsed every day with no problems at all, working well and has not given a hint of trouble so far.\n\nOnly two items I wish it had so far,  a bit of a plastic tab at the center edge of the lid to make it easier to open from the center, don't think it's a good idea to open from the corners and twist the lid/screen frame.\n\nAlso really wish it had a HD camera facing outward (where you are looking) in the top so you could take photos like you can  with a tablet or phone.\n\nAlt + backspace will get you \"delete\" action\n\nSee other key toggles when you hit Ctrl+ Alt + ?\n\nBe sure to understand this uses Chrome operating system and does not use any Windows or Mac software.  Also note there is a difference between Chrome OS and Chrome browser, so something made for Windows Chrome \"Browser\" is not for Chrome OS etc."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "Short Version:\nIf you're not familiar with the sorts of things ChromeOS can and can't do, you should look into that before buying anything. If you search Google for things like what is a chromebook and ChromeOS limitations, you'll run into some nice articles that go over it.\n\nMy feeling is that ChromeOS is designed to do a limited set of things, but it does them well. It allows me to get certain parts of my work done more easily, using a device that has a REALLY long battery life and is small and very light. I love the fact that I can easily grab a Chromebook and move to work in another location when my dog wants to cuddle or I'm overseeing a kid working on a homework assignment, and I don't have to worry about whether the battery will hold up or whatever.\n\nThe key thing is making sure that you have a clear idea of what you want to do and whether ChromeOS can do that. If you want to install Steam games or play Minecraft, this is NOT the laptop for you (unless you're comfortable with installing Linux on it, which doesn't apply to the average person). If you want to interact with websites, write blog posts, and take online classes, these are really great to have.\n\nLong version (including comparisons to the C720 Acer released last year):\nThe size and basic hardware of this Chromebook are pretty much in line with the other options out there that are in a similar price range. If you were to actually look closely at the specs and compare them to what you'd typically find in an OS X or Windows laptop, they'll seem pretty weak. It works out really well, though, because ChromeOS is designed to be a limited operating system that's mostly used to access the web, doing things like visiting websites and watching videos. Since it doesn't have to do things like complicated video editing tasks that someone might want to do on a desktop, it doesn't need high end hardware to get the job done.\n\nThe benefit that comes with the hardware that they did choose is that it doesn't require very much power to run. I charged this thing up and then carried it around the house with me doing all of my normal computer tasks (I spend a lot of time online taking classes and doing my professional work) and you can use it for hours, glance at the battery indicator, and feel like you've hardly put a dent in it. The company claims 8.5 hours on a charge, and I think I might've actually been able to go longer than that if I'd really wanted to push it.\n\nI have also used the C720 from the same company (which is one of the more popular Chromebooks out there) and performance-wise the two are honestly pretty similar. I can open a dozen tabs easily on 2GB of RAM without feeling like I'm giving the device trouble or having it slow down on me.\n\nIt feels like they boosted the build quality a little going from the C720 to this CB3. The keyboard feels a little nicer under my hands. I still don't love the way their trackpads feel when you actually press them down for a click, but they also accept a quick tap as a click and that feels fine. (I think they assumed most people would tap, so making the track pad click feel perfect may not have been a huge priority.)\n\nThe CB3 is also very slightly wider than the C720. It seems to be because they made the bezel a little thicker around the screen. It's also available in white, and I don't think the C720 ever was, so if you hate grey/black laptops, that's a nice bit of variety. The size/shape difference is subtle, and you should still be able to fit it into things like sleeves made for 11\" laptops. (The C720 got a lot of 3rd party support for accessories and decals and cases specifically for it, but I don't know if that'll happen for this edition as well.)\n\nThey also moved the power and HDMI ports to the back, instead of the side.\n\nFor the most part, honestly, I've had the chance to try a few different Chromebooks and the performance doesn't generally vary much if you're just looking to do things like visit social media sites, read the news, watch Netflix, write documents, and that sort of thing. They all use the same ChromeOS, so they all have the same basic features as far as what it's possible to do. If you're using sites with a lot of complicated scripting or something like that, you should worry a little more about the specs, but for the average person just about any Chromebook that's out there is going to do a good job performance-wise.\n\nIf you're planning to make it run a more standard form of Linux instead of using only ChromeOS, though, you will want to at least make sure you pay attention to what processor you're getting. There are some pieces of software for Linux that aren't available at all for non-Intel architectures. If you're planning to run something like Ubuntu on your Chromebook, then, it's probably worth going for an Intel Chromebook (and this is one). This only applies to a small sliver of the overall shopping population, though, so don't worry about it if this whole paragraph made no sense to you.\n\nThe price/performance ratio you get with Chromebooks is fantastic. I have Windows and Linux going on desktop computers that are much more powerful on paper, and I still spend a fair part of my day using ChromeOS. I even find myself sometimes grabbing a Chromebook to do something even if I'm physically at the desk where the more powerful computers are set up. It's nice to have this environment that's somewhat locked down (you mostly can't install software programs, for example) because that reduces security issues.\n\nChromeOS does a limited number of things, but it does them very well. If you rely heavily on the Internet to do things that are important to you, this device is well worth what they're charging for it."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "This is an amazing value for the price.  It looks and feels substantial and well made. I'm giving it 5 stars because of its features and portability even though my own performance is so far unsatisfactory.  Transitioning from years of use of a Windows computer is not easy, at least for me.\n\nMy reason for wanting this Chromebook was the desire to downsize when traveling.  At only 2.4 pounds, this gives me close to a 60% reduction in weight compared to the laptop I've been carrying and an even greater reduction because I can easily carry it in  a backpack and not the heavy, wheeled computer case I've been using.\n\nThis Chromebook comes with only 16 GB internal storage, however, there are 2 USB ports (2.0 & 3.0) and an SD port, so storage can easily be increased by use of a flash drive, SD card, or external hard drive, all of which are supported. You also have the option of using the 100 GB of storage on Google Drive, but I prefer to use my storage device so won't be accepting Google's storage offer.\n\nThe start up is very fast.  No doubt one reason is that it is not loaded up like my Windows computer.\n\nThe transition has so far been frustrating, but progress is being made.  There are good helps on the Chromebook and there is also a lot of helpful information on the internet that can be access by a Google search.\n\nMy positive feelings substantially increased when I switched from the touch pad to a wireless mouse.  I have always used a wireless mouse because I don't like touch pads and I now feel more confident because of the mouse.\n\nAlthough I cannot confirm it with test results, battery life is said to be 8+ hours.  I can confirm that screen lighting and resolution are very good.\n\nIf all I wanted to do was read and receive emails, I am already comfortable with that.  But important to me when traveling is to be able to review photos taken and do some editing.  Based on what I have read so far, I know this can be done, I just need to learn how and get some practice doing so.  I will not be able to use the photo editing software I am using on my Windows computer, but there are several free photo editing aps in the Chromebooks Ap Store, one of which (Pixar) I have installed.  It has excellent reviews.\n\nI also need time to investigate the many other aps that are offered in the Ap Store to determine how they might help me.  And I still have a lot to learn about the various features, like \"files\".  But I think I am on the right road.\n\nTo use the Chromebook you must have a Gmail account, but you can continue to use your usual email program.  I have long been using Fastmail.fm and I continue to use it on the Chromebook.  There is a link on my bookmarks bar that enables to open the program whenever I want.\n\nTransitioning to something new is often difficult, and switching to a Chromebook from a Windows computer is no exception.  But now that I am starting to see a little light at the end of the tunnel, I think it will be worth the effort."}

Note that Chrome OS is not the equivalent of Android, either, because most Google Play Store apps don't run on Chromebooks. However, I read in an article that Google is trying to work with app developers to make more apps accessible to Google Chrome store. It doesn't bother me much because I have my phone and laptop to do what this Chromebook doesn't.\nOverall, it's good for a college student who doesn't want to carry much too class."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "I'll admit to being a bit of a technophile, always on the hunt for a new gadget to play with, but my search for a Chromebook was born of an actual reason. I do a lot of freelance writing and editing in my off-time and I needed something both usable and portable. My laptop (bless its little processor) is a bit of a beast and getting on in years, and its constant lagging is a killer; my iPad mini, while portable and great to use for wasting time on the internet or reading, isn't a feasible writing or editing tool. And so began my foray into the world of Chromebooks. Long story short, taking the plunge with the Acer CB3 was one of the best decisions I've made.\n\n*** PROS:\n\n- Syncs with your Google account (which, duh, it's a CHROMEbook) -- this was perfect for me, as I do all of my writing/editing in Google Docs and Gmail.\n\n- Though it isn't using the familiar interfaces of Windows or OSX, it was very easy to adapt to the Chrome OS. It's a lot closer to Windows 7 than anything, albeit a very stripped-down version.\n\n- Super fast and strong wifi connection. For reference, my bedroom is the furthest point from my living room (on the other side of the apartment, where my router lives) and my iPad Mini's wifi connection is spotty at best in my room (it frequently cuts out altogether). My Chromebook's connection in my room is 100%, all the time.\n\n- Boots up in, like, 20 seconds. My laptop takes about 3 or 4 years to load everything.\n\n- Battery life. It lasts a VERY long time in between charges.\n\n- Matte screen. I think the last non-glossy screen I used was my desktop computer back in the day. It took all of 5 minutes for me to get used to it; my eyes almost wept in joy. Every other glossy screen seems too harsh now.\n\n- Well-designed track pad. It's like a scene out of Goldilocks: not too sensitive, not too dull, but juuust right.\n\n- Very decent speakers. I was quite surprised by how loud and clear the sound is. I was in the living room the other day, watching something on YouTube, and my roommate thought it was the TV.\n\n- The keyboard. I don't know what it is about it, but I adore it. I think it's how quiet it is, maybe.\n\n- Easily customizable settings. From how you want to scroll to using Chrome Extensions, the settings are easy to access, navigate, and implement.\n\n- The weight. Holy cow, this thing is light. Clocking in at 2.4lbs, this thing is like carrying nothing. I thought I was going to snap it in half the day I took it out of the box. Super slim, super light, and (like Mini-Me from Austin Powers) able to fit in small storage spaces (like my purse).\n\n*** CONS (which aren't cons so much as things to get used to):\n\n- No dedicated CAPS LOCK key. Although most Chromebooks don't have one, it's something I've been conditioned to have. There are two ways to achieve that oh-so-necessary yell mode, though: hold Shift down and type, or press Alt+Shift to enable CAPS LOCK mode. Pressing Shift again will revert back to normal mode. (In place of the CAPS LOCK key is a key that launches a search window)\n\nUPDATE: Thanks to user M. Bentley, I've discovered that you can change the function of the CTRL, ALT, and Search keys. In settings under \"Device,\" select \"Keyboard Settings\" and make your selection from the dropdown menus. My Search key is now permanently CAPS LOCK!\n\n- Keyboard shortcuts. I'm sure I could have just as easily read the manual, but I didn't (who even does that, honestly?), so I floundered a bit until I Googled some tips 'n tricks. Luckily, OMGChrome! already anticipated people like me and had a little guide handy. (http://www.omgchrome.com/10-shortcuts-every-chromebook-owner-should-know/)\n\n- The desktop. You don't actually use it for anything other than to display your wallpaper; I can't tell you how often I try to drag things onto it, simply because I'm used to doing that. Everything you're going to use is on the taskbar. So find yourself a good wallpaper, since it won't be hidden by icons. I've got a stunning image of the Tarantula Nebula, myself.\n\nAll in all? It's exactly what I need it to be, and it's perfect. 10/10 would recommend, and all that."}

A Chromebook is a unique product intended to fit a particular need. With some performance variances the different brands of Chromebooks all perform essentially the same basic function.\n\nThis particular model is the entry level low price leader and for many people there is no need to pay more, if you keep your expectations reasonable.\n\nAt under $200 the buyer still gets an impressive armada of features, wrapped in an attractive and reasonable well-built package.  That includes dual core Intel Celeron N2830 processor at 2.16 Ghz speed up to 2.41 GHz with Intel Burst Technology, 2 GB DDR3L SDRAM for sufficient multitasking- being able to open several pages simultaneously, 16 GB flash memory that helps with quicker boot-ups and instant waking up from sleep mode plus 100GB of Cloud based Google Drive storage. The screen is easy to read, the keys are satisfactory to a touch typist and the performance is zippy enough for its intended purpose, and the battery life can get you through an entire day.\n\nOkay, we've mentioned \"particular need\" and \"intended purpose\" already. Who is the likely customer for a Chromebook and does this model meet their reasonable needs?\n\nWHAT A CROMEBOOK IS NOT\n\n1. It's not a replacement for a traditional laptop computer, whether that is an Apple or a PC. It has limited ability to run some additional applications (other than what's built in) but it is not intended for intensive use by the businessperson, student or person who requires compatible productivity on the road.\n\n2. It is not a substitute for an iOS or Android tablet or phablet, both of which have thousands of apps available, touchscreen with gestures and easy mobility. They generally have higher resolution screens making them a better choice as a video playback device.\n\nWHAT A CHROMEBOOK IS\n\n1. It is an \"in between\" product that incorporates the best characteristics of a tablet and a traditional laptop for that person whose primary requirements are websurfing, email and notetaking. As a generality it does those tasks better than a tablet or smartphone by virtue of its larger screen and always attached real physical keyboard.\n\n2. Owning a Chromebook can complement owning a traditional laptop, smartphone and/or tablet. For example, someone who travels often can appreciate having a lighter-duty version of a full-size laptop when their needs are primarily web-based. Chromebooks work just fine for cranking out lengthy emails and reports or doing creative writing while away from home. While larger tablets can do the same if accompanied by a separate keyboard, a Chromebook is simply an easier solution.\n\nAcer is a long-time respected manufacturer and this Chromebook is surprisingly well-built, especially for the price. Nothing about it can be compared to a $1000 high-end notebook, but by comparison nothing about it feels cheap or toy-like.\n\nWOULD-BE NEGATIVES\n\nTo someone who has bought a computer, tablet or even a smartphone recently the Acer Chromebook's specs might look weak. But the dual core Intel Celeron N2830 processor running at 2.16 Ghz is more powerful than the desktop computers of many people who are reading this. For its intended purpose, the specs are actually quite adequate. Surfing the web and writing emails does not take multitasking powerful processors, nor does it take a huge hard drive (with Chromebooks your files are store in the Cloud, and Acer provides 100 GB of storage space free for the first 2 years). The screen does not have to be ultra-high resolution either. This model's screen can be described as good for websurfing, emails and light productivity but can disappoint for high resolution video playback, however the sound quality is better than one would expect. The only thing that might be missed by some people is a touch screen, as we are so used to them these days. Going \"back\" to a trackpad might be an unlearning experience for some. But then again there are few touchscreen Chrome apps and the system isn't really optimized for touchscreen and the excellent trackpad offers some of the most practical multi-gesture functions.\n\nLike traditional laptops the Acer Chromebook has a separate power supply for charging and for use on AC power. If you are used to tablets and smartphones which use the now universal micro USB cable, it may be disappointing to have to carry the larger and heavier power supply the Chromebook uses.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThe good news is that the Acer Chromebook brings a lot of value for the under $200 price ... IF you keep your expectations reasonable. This is important - standing solely on its own merit this laptop would not ordinarily earn a 5-star rating compared to high-end notebook computers. It is a basic machine designed to perform basic, but important, needs.  It is what it delivers for the value price that sets it apart and makes it a best buy in its category and hence earns 5-stars."}

The 8-hour battery life is not 'the best' but it's good enough to last for one day of typical use and then maybe some. As all Chromebooks, you get 100 GB of Google Drive storage, free for 2 years.\n\nMy experience with Acer's Chromebook 11 is that of a responsive little machine that should handle most 'media consumption' tasks such as movie watching. If you want to do 'productivity', I had no problem going through and handling my email and, thanks to Bluetooth and the 2 USB ports (USB 3.0 and USB 2.0) it's easy use it with mice and keyboards. I didn't try it myself but, with a monitor attached through the HDMI port, it could be made into a nice desktop-like appliance, if so desired.\n\nI view this as a great machine and 'I love it' (5 stars) because:\n\n- Stays true to the traditional Chromebook 'low price' expectations.\n- It's way faster than the first generation of under-200-dollar Chromebooks\n- Has all the nice ports for good expansion\n- Supports 802.11ac which can get you very fast Wi-Fi (over 500 Mbps on this one)\n- It's pretty overall\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nFor anyone new to Chromebooks, here are some of my thoughts that may help one decide whether 'a Chromebook' would be a good choice/\n\nWHY A CHROMEBOOK AT ALL?\n\nThere's so much to say here but let me make a quick summary. And never forget that we are talking about an 'around 300 dollars' device here because, yes, anything that costs 3-4-5 times as much should do SOMETHING better or very few of us would pay more for such devices.\n\n My Chromebook is by far my most used computer excluding work hours and by 'computer' I mean PCs, laptops and tablets.\n Malware, spyware, adware-free. Since nothing is really 'installed' on a Chromebook and not much is physically stored on it, it would be very hard for one to be infected. I am in fact now using my Chromebook to open suspicious emails or click on dubious URLs that I don't dare touch from a laptop.\n Extremely safe OS. I don't know if this is common knowledge but Google is constantly challenging hackers to crack their OS. As far as I know, Chrome OS wasn't cracked yet.\n Easy to share among any number of users without any concerns of compromising privacy. If you have a Google account, you simply sign in and you are going to be within your own, personal environment.\n Constantly updated and upgraded. Google updates Chrome OS every few weeks and I found my Chromebooks actually getting better all the time rather than slowly fall into obsolescence.\n Nearly maintenance free. Whenever I don't use a tablet or even a laptop for a while, they tend to get very busy once I turn them back on, downloading and installing various patches, updates and upgrades. Not the case for Chromebooks. Whatever upgrades may take place don't hit my Chromebook. Whenever I call up an app, I get it in its latest version.\n The attached keyboard helps a lot. Yes, you can pair a keyboard and even a mouse to a tablet but the Chromebook's keyboard is always there, it negates the need of a stand or even some protecting case.\n Chrome OS is streamlined and efficiently focused where it matters, on the everyday uses most of us need a 'computer' most of the time.\n Chrome OS being such a streamlined one, browsing and running apps on a Chromebook is in fact faster than off a PC/laptop/tablet of equivalent specs.\n Relatively low prince, 11.6\" display and light weight seem to be just about right for something that typically you'd be using to browse the Web while watching TV or take to and from school.\n\nWHY NOT A CHROMEBOOK?\n\nTrue, Chromebooks can't do everything. Google's productivity suites notwithstanding, Chromebooks are best at media consumption rather than production. Nobody should buy a Chromebook and expect to be able to edit video or do some hard-core gaming. There are other machines and devices for such tasks. My experience is that a Chromebook can't do 'everything'. Tablets are more portable, PCs and laptops are more powerful and versatile but, to me, my Chromebook is the most fun to use and it's likely to stay this way. I am not going to call it my 'second' or 'third' or 'first' computer but, objectively, it's the one I most use outside business hours if what we measure is 'hours'."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "This is a pretty long review. I basically used my Chromebook non-stop for three days, on and offline.  The review is a little disjointed, but it's based on real-world use and my personal observations.\n\nThere's a lot to be said about this Chromebook. If you were to list all the features, benefits and what it can do, then print the list, that list would probably weigh more than this device.  Of course you need to ask yourself if a Chromebook is for you.  The \"next big thing\" a couple of years ago was the \"netbook\" - a scaled-down notebook that required the web for almost everything. It was a massive flop. Now we have the Chromebook. A scaled-down notebook that requires the web for almost everything. No internal storage, or CD or DVD. All your programs (apps) are run from the web - or in the cloud. Same thing.\n\nIf you're in an area where free wifi is abundant and you can get a signal wherever you pull out the Chromebook, you're all set.  If you don't have wifi and it's not that available in your area, then a Chromebook's functionality is greatly reduced.\n\nI'm on the fence with Chromebooks.  If I really wanted one, this is the model I'd choose. The wifi is fast, the battery seems to last forever, and the non-glare screen is amazing. The chiclet keyboard is nice, with plenty of spacing between the keys so even large fingers won't mash two keys at a time. Bootup is almost instantaneous. Waking up is instant. Once you complete setup, your browser settings, shortcuts, Gmail - it's all synced automatically.\n\nSome of the issues I have with the Chromebook is the OS and are personal.  I've used Windows for years. I started with 3.1 because that's what Adobe required on the PC for their software.  I'm used to function keys and many shortcuts. There are no function keys and most of the shortcuts I know don't work on the Chromebook. That's just some time to learn.  But if you're married to your Windows laptop, you'll be at a loss for a little while on the Chromebook.\n\nMy largest complaint is the wifi login.  You can only enter a password. No user name. My secure business and secure home connections require a user name AND password.  I can't enter a user name. So I have to use the guest login - that only requires a password.  But then I don't have access to the network (just the web) and I have to login frequently. At the office, that's every four hours. At home, it's every 12 hours. For whatever reason, login often takes a dozen tries. I know my password - I use it all the time. So I'll shut it down, then try again - then it works. Frustrating.\n\nFor ports, there's one USB 3, one USB 2, one HDMI, the power connector and a 1/8\" headphone jack.\n\nThere are also two speakers on the bottom.  If the Chromebook is on your lap, the speakers are very quiet. If the Chromebook is on a hard surface they're a lot louder. Sound quality is OK. If you use the headphones you'll be blown away.\n\nStorage: Chrome OS owners get 100GB of Google Drive storage free for 2 years - it's a one time thing. If you have two Chromebooks, you get 100GB. You probably already have 15GB free from Google - 15 gig is pretty decent.  115 is even better. But what about after the two years?  Chances are Google will keep increasing the standard amount of free space, but I doubt it will hit 100 gig in two years. Once the offer is up, you can retrieve your files, but you can't save anything until you're down to the current free space offered (currently 15 gig.)  So if you have 50 gig used and the offer expires, you need to remove 35 gig.\n\nThe upside is that Google charges really low prices for storage - $1.99 a month for 100 gig, and $10 a month for 1TB!  This storage can be accessed by you from any networked device.\n\nTo get your free 100 gig, go to chromebook.com/goodies on your Chrome device. Don't bother trying it from a PC (I did) - there's nothing to fill out. It detects the device automatically.  There are other offers there for Chrome OS users.  They can pretty much pay for the device.  Currently there's two free months of music (a $20 value), the Google storage offer ($80 value), and 12 passes for in-air internet use while flying (must all be used in one year - worth at least $50.) If you fly or travel a lot, the Chromebook is a great choice - especially with the free in-air web offer. Lightweight and long battery life - plus it's so darn thing.\n\nTo redeem the free storage offer, just use the button on the goodies page. It's automatic. The Chromebook is detected and you have the 100 gig in a few minutes.\n\nOK, what if you can't get on the web. Is this a paperweight, albeit a light one? Nope - you can download offline apps, work on the Chromebook, then sync everything after you're on the web again.  It takes more time to FIND these apps online than to set them up. I used the link in the menu for the Google store, then searched \"offline\" in apps. The search took about 15 seconds, then a list of free apps was displayed. I added gmail, Scrolled down the list, looking for the other free Google apps. They were already selected and downloaded for me. You don't have all the functionality for all the apps as if you were online - for example, the calendar is read-only. You can't edit or add anything.\n\nSo I thought I'd try the offline apps. First I selected the link for \"Gmail offline.\" Received an error that the app was unreachable. So I clicked on the \"learn more\" link. Nope - you need to be online for the help for the offline app that wants you online.\n\nOK, reconnected to the wed.  Tried Gmail Offline again. This time it ran and gave me an option to allow offline mail or nor. I checked \"Allow offline mail.\" A status appeared in the lower left telling me the status of the mail sync - messages and attachments were synced.  Cool, I can now compose and answer email offline.  What about dose and the rest?\n\nI searched for \"offline\" - the results gave instructions for the PC, Android and IOS.  And text saying \"try Chrome!\" - with no help for Chrome. So I searched for \"offline Chrome\" - five minutes later, still no results. Then I tried \"edit docs chrome offline.\" Gave up after three minutes of watching the \"working\" icon. So I went to Google instead of using the help. OK - instructions found. It was already setup for offline use. Hmmmm. Turned off the network access. None of the apps work.  Just the typical \"...app unreachable...\" error and \"learn more\" link that does nothing. OK. Getting annoyed. Two hours, and still no offline capability. Tried the \"Google drive\" app. That worked. Local copies are visible. But none of the files will open because the app can't be found. Wondering if the Chromebook will emulate a Frisbee. Tried to create a document. \"...app unreachable...\" error. Open my calendar. \"...app unreachable...\" error. Maybe the Chromebook can be used as a clay pigeon.  OK, so I can see what's in my Google drive, but can't do anything with it. Maybe it's taunting me. I'll try again later. I'm getting way too annoyed.\n\nWent back online and clicked the \"play music\" icon. Hmmm. Free for 30 days, then $9.99 per month. Er, no thanks.  So the button will always be there, reminding me I'm too cheap to fork over $10 a month to listen to my own iTunes library. Yea, there's more than that, but I have over 30,000 songs. It took me a week to rip all the CD's from my collection. Plus if I use the link on the offers page, it's two free months.\n\nHmmm. What if I want to listen to music offline? Watch a movie? Turned off networking again, and copied a few albums and videos to a USB key. Plug in the key. The results? A directory automatically opens. Played a 1.8 gig video file. Nice quality, looks like there's more pixelation than with my PC. Sound is also good. Music? Album art is ignored, but I can navigate down to the songs. Again, sound quality is good.  Much better with a headset.\n\nSo I can watch movies and listen to music when offline - I just need a USB device.\n\nOK, back to offline stuff.  Clicking on gMail does not work, clicking on gMail offline does work. You'd think the thing would know if you're online or not and open up the correct version. Nope.  So are there icons for \"offline\" versions for the other apps? Nope.  Now what? Turned on the wireless again and visited the Google store. Again.  I find the offline doc app and click \"launch\" i it runs the online version.  Back to Google - or maybe I should try Yahoo? Funny. After 15 minutes of searching I finally found the answer. Even though everything I read states that the Chromebook is designed to work offline as a default, it's not.  You have to be online and allow each app individually to allow offline access.  And the option is not always in the same place or called the same thing. Under mail it's \"syncing files.\" Under the calendar it's simply \"offline.\"  You sometimes have to hunt for it. According to \"docs\" it's already set up and synced, yet I can't open any docs offline.\n\nTried \"sheets\" and the rest - they just displayed the \"working\" icon. The Calendar worked. Oh wait - none of my appointments are there. OK, maybe things are taking a long time (over four hours?) to sync. I'll try later and leave it online.\n\nOther observations:\nThe built-in video chat app is decent - but the camera quality is so-so.\nEverything runs in the Chrome browser, so you need to adopt that mindset.\nCharging is FAST. Fully charged in just an hour.\nSetup and test EVERYTHING before you really need it.  It took several tries and 10 hours to get the offline apps to finally work. I'm no noob. I build my own PC's. I have three Android tablets, an iPad, Kindle, Kindle Fire and Android phone. I have three PC's and repair PC's. I install networks and manage file servers.  The Chromebook had me stumped several times - but that's a comment on the O.S., not the hardware.\n\nIf you want a web-enabled \"laptop\", this is really, really nice.  Want to work without the web? You'll need to configure all the apps online, sync, then test and test again.  This part really appears to be a work in progress.  Some websites call the offline apps \"beta\" versions. It's a great travel option as well. But honestly - what's better for you - a Windows laptop for around $400, a tablet for around $200, or a Chromebook for $200? If you want battery life and a keyboard, the Chromebook is it.  Power and a true computer? A laptop.  Touchscreen? A tablet."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00MMLV7VQ", "review": "The Acer and I got off to a rough start, but once we got over the hump, we've become fast friends. The roadblock was the Wi-Fi connection. I entered my Wi-Fi info three times -- carefully checking the caps and numbers. That compelled me to hit the big ? icon to get help. It wouldn't load.\n\nEventually, I woke up and noticed the update icon (white arrow pointing up), clicked it and all was right with the Chromebook. The four-page setup guide didn't include this as one of the steps. However, on the back, it does say to update your system. This should be in the first steps. I just assumed the update note was to keep everything updated -- not that it would fix my wireless connection.\n\nHow did it fix the wireless connection if I couldn't connect? Thankfully, the Chromebook connected to my network as a Guest. Don't know how that's possible without stealing someone's bandwidth. Curious. Will update this if I find an answer.\n\nI have an iPad 4 with a case and a wireless keyboard. I weighed the iPad with its case  (30 oz) and the Chromebook (38 oz). The Only an 8-ounce difference! I never use the iPad's Bluetooth keyboard as it's not attached and I prefer to use my iPad's case as its cover rather than the keyboard. Still there are of times when I wish a keyboard was more convenient as I could never type as fast on-screen as I can with a physical keyboard (tiny BlackBerry keyboard included).\n\nIf you're debating between a Chromebook and a tablet -- I'd recommend the Chrome book because the weight difference is minuscule and you get the benefit of a usable keyboard. (The iPad's keyboard isn't as usable as the Chromebook's. Typing on the Chromebook is closer to the laptop experience.) The keyboard takes getting used to as it's missing the delete key -- one that I use a lot. Had to dig in the Help to find the shortcut to delete things.\n\nOf course, the Chromebook is Google-focused. Google Chrome, Google Docs, and having stuff in the cloud, etc. etc. So if that bugs you -- this isn't for you. If you use Gmail, Google Contacts and Google Calendar, it all seamlessly shows up on the Chromebook. While I prefer MS Word's features (I'm a writer) to Google Docs, I tend not to do heavy-duty writing work on the Chromebook so it's good enough.\n\nWhen I open it, the Chromebook connects to the Wi-Fi noticeably faster than my laptop. Probably about 3 to 5 seconds vs. the laptop's 8 to 10. Battery life is fantastic -- lives up to its advertised 8.5 hours of battery life. I was watching videos for a lot of it and it didn't drain faster.\n\nGlare drives me nuts, so I like the Acer's matte screen. However, the screen isn't perfect as you need to move the screen around to see everything. It doesn't take much movement for part of the screen to fade. But c'mon. For this price? Not a big deal.\n\nAs of today, there is no downloadable manual for the Chromebook 11 on Acer's website. Although it comes with a built-in Help, it requires a connection to use it. The setup manual says you can get 100 gb free for two years. I'd like to know what happens after that. Wouldn't want to have a ton of stuff on it and then have to pay for it.\n\nI love that it's light, has about the small keyboard possible that's close to a laptop keyboard and I can do all the basics on it ... surfing, emailing, writing.\n\nUpdate: Nov 6, 2014\n\nOne big plus about the Chromebook over a tablet or iPad is that it stands up solidly. Making the iPad stand up with a standard cover never feels solid like in these photos:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Ultra-Thin-Smart-Case/dp/B00HA7HTQY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Ultra Thin Smart Case</a>&nbsp;I had been using the iPad to watch and follow exercise videos. Plus, the video often switches between standing and sitting, so I'd have to move the iPad to see it. With the Chromebook, it's easier and faster. I never feel nervous. I do have to adjust the screen at times per my earlier explanation.\n\nI find I'm using the Chromebook more than the iPad for writing emails and watching videos (when I don't want to hold on to it)."}

I have been theorizing the possibility of creating my own mobile work environment using this Chromebook and a few of the Google services.  I didn't think it would work so well with a $200 machine, but I was wrong!\n\nChrome Remote Desktop works like a charm.  I can easily access my main machine from ANYWHERE.  It's very responsive and the screen resolution is better than acceptable for any emulator.\n\nThen, I have linked my office number to my Google Voice number.  All office calls will be automatically forwarded to my Google Voice, which I access via my Chromebook.  I can have a few outgoing msgs that can be activated based on the different circumstances.  I do not need a separate headsets as the built-in speaker and the microphone are fantastic for all type of phone conversations in any setting (in/outdoor).  All rejected and missed calls will be routed to the Google Voice inbox, which converts the voice msg into text and sends the text and voice file to my email inbox (Gmail).  So, I can either read or listen to the msg or forward it to my team members.  Team members do not have to have ANY of this Google set up as the msg is fully contained within the body of the email itself.\n\nAll MS Office files I use have been converted  to Google Doc or Sheets file.  The offline function works well and it re-syncs the files the moment I get connected online.  Sharing the file is very simple as well.  Security and access management is very straightforward.\n\nI am COMPLETELY MOBILE with an 11 inch Chromebook.  No computer bags, no office phone.  All is packed in a small Chromebook!  It works VERY VERY well and for VERY long time (I can easily get 9+ hours of work usage on a single charge: no Netflix).\n\nBy the way, this Chromebook has no fan and it stays cool.  The touchpad is large and responsive.  It is clearly optimized for productivity and simplicity.\n\nA possible drawback is that the keyboard does not light up, so you will need a little reading light if you need to use in the dark.  The battery is inside the casing so it cannot be removed (easily).\n\nHighly recommended."}
