This new Samsung is an excellent tablet that is very light , with an extremely bright screen. The intel processor is lightning quick with excellent benchmark test results. It even has an \"ir\" tv remote control sensor built in that incorporates a very detailed tv guide and allows you to change channels. Also the Samsung Smart Screen gives you voice control, as well as monitors your eye contact and will not turn the display off while you're looking at it."}

After about 6 months on an andoid phone I decided to give this andriod tablet a try to replace my ipad. Glad I did. Very fast and responsive. Videos play without delay and it makes a great business companion device. The Tab 3 10.1 super light and a very elegant design. Highly recommended in form and function."}

The wife uses all of these platforms, with the Tab 3 as a birthday present. Poor girl has no technology to play with after work.\n\nThe interface is more user friendly for beginners, faster, better picture and camera quality, while just staying ahead of Apple.\n\nWhat would have made the Tab 3 a perfect platform? Two or more GB Ram, full 1080p screen, and two more inches of screen would have made the day for most users.\n\nBest tablet on the market at present. It's a definite buy until a better unit arrives on the market."}

Yes the resolution could have been better for a 10.1 inch screen. I love my Samsung,  tablet. I would have went with the 8 but I use mine mostly to look at movies and youtube. I see people complaining about the megapixals on the camera. Seriously, who pulls their tablet out to take pictures?"}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00D029NNA", "review": "This device has been hobbled straight out of the box thanks to Samsung. ONE GB of RAM is UNACCEPTABLE. This device should have AT LEAST 2 GB of RAM. On the other hand, the Google Nexus 10 has 2 GB of RAM, a similarly equipped processor and DOUBLE the screen resolution for the SAME price, $399. Enough said. If you really must have one of the new Galaxy Tab 3 devices, the much smarter move would be to purchase the 8 inch version. It has 1.5 GB of RAM and will not suffer from the lag and hiccups that the 10.1 inch version surely will. The 8 incher costs $299 and is well worth the cost. The 10.1 version is overpriced and under powered. This 10.1 inch device could have been great. At its current iteration, it is not. One GB of RAM on this device is a joke. Period. One more thing. Remember this final point. This device costs  the SAME as the Nexus 10. The Nexus 10 simply blows this tablet away. There is no comparison. They aren't even in the same league. Samsung really screwed up on this device."}

In less than 1 year, two would no longer charge and the other 2 are beginning to show the same issues. I believe it is an problem with the charging port. A few weeks before they quit all together I had to wiggle the charging cables to get them to charge. I filed a claim with Samsung and they kept closing the claim because I needed to turn them on and run a diagnostic. Of course, since they could not charge, that was impossible. Currently trying to get them replaced through SquareTrade, but not confident. This whole experience has left me wary of purchasing any other Samsung products."}

At first I was happy to get a tablet but I really didn't understand or know what I could use it for. I am an ol' school girl and love my desktop computer. So, I started to download apps onto my tablet and started with playing Candy Crush/Farm Heroes (which I still play a lot). But, then I started to realize it was awesome as a music player. It has replaced my ipod. I now use my tablet to play  all of my music. I purchased headphones that have awesome bass capabilities and the sound that my headphones with the tablet - ohhhhh my. I downloaded rocket player and I can't stop listening to music. Now, I know it can do so much more. I love being able to check my email really quick from my bed (I run online businesses). I am still in the learning phase of what I can do with this tablet. But, after 2 years it is still going strong. I love it and so glad someone was so smart to purchase me this tablet :)"}

I feel as if I am a slave to the charger, as no sooner as I get it fully charged (which most times takes a whole night and part of the day), I would need to charge it again after two hours usage time maximum, sometimes less. I try all sorts of things like decreasing the brightness, using energy saving mode, taking off wifi when I don't use it, but at times it is a real pain to keep up with the battery. Another thing I notice is that it would just turn itself off on occasions, and I would then have to restart it. These are my issues but when it is on and charged, I have no problems."}

Samsung combined the best of both worlds. Uses an android based system, so I was very familiar with the workings as I have an android phone. Added a 32g mini card - haven't been able to overload the thing yet.  Easy set up, easy to download apps and tons of apps available. Definitely the best bang for the buck."}

The battery drains far quicker on this than on my old 7 inch Galaxy Tab 2 or on the iPad Air I use at work.  I can't get more than a few hours of use without having to plug it in.  The second issue is even more annoying to me.  Samsung places the micro-USB port right in the center of the bottom edge of the device.  This makes the port completely inaccessible when you're using a case with bluetooth keyboard or any other case that props the tablet up to a nice viewing angle--can't plug in the power cord, can't connect an adapter for a USB storage device or HDMI cable, can't use the port for anything.  This is a serious design flaw.  I was surprised to see in pictures of the Galaxy Tab 4 that Samsung continues to put that port in that location.  What can they possibly be thinking??"}

I'd used iPod Touch before and was quite impressed by the surprising functionality of the device (frankly I wasn't expecting iTouch to do much more than let me listen to music and look pretty), and I have to say this: Galaxy Tab has utterly failed to impress.\n\nI suspect at least a few of my pet peeves -- like the issues of viewing document attached to your email -- has more to do with Android system than the tablet itself. But the lag, which people complained about before, is seriously TERRIBLE. And come ON, there are other tablets in the market around the same price range with WAY better resolution. I don't need bells and whistles, I just wanted simple and clean functionality. This? Not it. And after a charging port issue that happened less than six months into the purchase? Never again. If i'm not liking Galaxy Tab, there is no way in hell I'll be getting a Galaxy Note in the future. Unless you're in love with any and all Samsung products, I'd look elsewhere."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00D029NNA", "review": "I honestly can't see how this tablet has gotten so many positive reviews. Maybe I was terribly unlucky, but the one I got was slow from the start and had endless problems with the charging pin. At first I couldn't connect it to any of our computers. Then it got finicky while charging, and finally I had to replace the whole piece because it wouldn't charge at all.\n\nThat was only the beginning of my troubles. The first time it slipped and fell a foot or two the glass shattered completely, and I mean competely. My S3 fell onto the highway while driving my motorbike once and it only had a few cracks. The replacement screen then somehow ruined the touchscreen and now the entire device is useless.\n\nI'm unfortunate enough to have bought a US model while I live in the Philippines, and apparently Samsung has different models here so of course no one has the parts to fix it.\n\nI've always liked Samsung phones, but my first tab has been a huge letdown.\n\nBad luck, I guess. What does it say for Samsung's quality assurance? I guess it says I should have gotten an iPad."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00D029NNA", "review": "Excellent tablet! I got this as an upgrade from an older Samsung and everything works very well. I would give this 4.5 stars if I could. I gave it 4 due to a flaw in the design. It has to do with the button on the center bottom of the tablet that brings you back to the desktop of the tablet. I guess we can call it the control button. It's placement makes it very difficult and uncomfortable to read with the tablet in portfolio mode (a mode which I believe most people read). If you read in landscape mode this issue is non-existent. The issue is when you hold the tablet in portrait mode you WILL hit the buttons there in the center with your thumb. There is no way around it. If Samsung moved these buttons to the center/bottom in portrait mode, this wouldn't be an issue. This is where the IPad has its control button. Thus reading with this tablet is awkward."}

I started having trouble charging it, and contacted Samsung and was told I needed a new AC adapter and they would put in an order), I still have three months on my 1-year warranty.  Seven days later I hadn't heard anything, so I contacted again.  I was told to call an 800 number and the first time I called I was hung up on, the second time I actually made it to a human being and was told I would need to send everything in to them in order to get service as they don't send adapters. I have been using my tablet for my business transactions and I will have to find something more reliable to use for this purpose. HEY SAMSUNG - I NOW KNOW WHY I COULDN'T GET AN EXTENDED WARRANTY FOR YOUR PRODUCT.  ALSO, YOU MIGHT WANT TO TAKE A PAGE FROM AMAZON'S PLAYBOOK ON CUSTOMER SERVICE!  It's completely ridiculous to have to send everything back to Samsung to get an adapter that certainly should be covered under 1-year warranty.  Incredible ineptitude and the ABSOLUTE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I've encountered to date!  These are NOT low-end tablets - just low-end company who purposely makes it incredibly difficult to do business with them!!!"}

I went from a Nextbook 8\" tablet to this and there's a world of difference, I had gone through 6 Nextbooks all of them having frozen up. Samsung is a name that you can depend on and they've again proven it with the Galaxy Tab 3. It has 16 GB ready and waiting for you to install apps, my apps are mostly casino slots and Texas Holdem Poker, but any app I have installed runs smoothly. With 16 GB on my device and a 32GB SD card in the slot, I've never run out of memory but I do wish it would take a 64GB SD card ;-). Talk about fast! This device is swift, zpt zap, and you're where you asked it to take you. Galaxy also has it's own tiny person inside the tablet sort of like Siri. All of my games run smooth, the only drawback is no Flash player for android, but I'm sure we all know about that problem. I used to be so frustrated not being able to play Facebook games; that, I solved by getting Photon browser from the Play store. If you're looking for a 10 1/2 inch Galaxy Tab, this is a cheaper alternative to the new 4, and you won't regret buying it."}

Got off the phone and tried to load apps...wouldn't load. Called Samsung back, they said it had to be sent in. Sent it in on Tuesday, Sept. 2 (Monday was a holiday). They received on Monday, Sept. 8. Received an email on Wed. Sept. 10 that the warranty was voided because it had \"physical damage\". It has always been in a case, never dropped and never any moisture. Called the person Amber, that sent the message, she wasn't there but talked with Anna. I asked to talk with her supervisor....sent me to a different Amber in \"Executive Customer Relations\".....no help from her except she said the physical damage was that someone tried to \"pry the screen off\" REALLY?????? They are LIARS. I haven 't a clue about opening a tablet OR computer. I am so very upset that they have told me this, therefore, this has voided the warranty and now I have to pay $199 to fix something that I NEVER did what they are accusing me of. I bought this tablet at COSTCO, so I know it wasn't a refurbished tablet. Bottom line, when I get this back it it dies, I will NEVER buy another SAMSUNG product again.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00D029NNA", "review": "This tablet is horrible to say the least. My first generation pre 3G Xoom by Motorola from 6+ years ago blows this \"new\" tablet away. The processor is very slow. It consistently keeps things running the background that have to manually close to keep the processor from bogging down. I cannot find a search engine that works well with the platform. Neither Chrome, Firefox nor the pre loaded generic \"Internet\" search engine works well. The touch screen keyboard consistently does not pick up key strokes and regularly picks up spaces when bottom row letters like b, n and m are struck.  The \"eye recognition\" feature was the first thing I turned off. When turning the machine on or waking it up from being dormant, the time it takes to finally allow me to enter my password is uncomfortable at best. From day one it takes me multiple attempts to enter my 4 letter pass word because one of the strokes is not registered. In fact, I am laughing right now while typing this review at how many back spaces I am using to get it right.  DO NOT BUY!!! I have a Galaxy S5 phone that I love, this Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 I DO NOT!!!"}

Some apps start crashing, and when they do, they do it repeatedly until I restart the Tablet.  I have to restart it at least once every week.  I had that same problem with the Galaxy Tab 2, so it's probably tied to the compatibility of one or more of the apps I use on the tablet software/hardware/OS.  I use the same apps on my Galaxy S3 phone without problems."}

Takes 3 days to fully charge to 100%  but it doesn't show the correct amount. When I turn it on it can have anywhere between 30%-70%. Looked at some forums and it seems that others have had the same problem. Some have been returned and worked perfectly fine, while others still have the same problem even after returning them for service/maintenance. Samsung should consider having removable back and batteries for their tablets aswell ... (Works great on their phones, why not their tablets too... Maybe they'll last longer--both the battery and the product--)... If you need a Samsung tablet buy the tab 4, tab s, or tab pro. If they're too pricey for you, there are always alternatives. You don't always need to buy form the same manufacturer.."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00D029NNA", "review": "I was very disappointed with the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 with the Android system.  You can not use the Adobe Flash player with this tablet.  There are several programs that I watch and listen to on a regular basis which are run by Adobe Flash player.  I tried downloading an older version of the Adobe Flash player for Android, but now my tablet will not allow it to run;  it totally blocks it from working.  I downloaded the photon browser which has a flash player, but now it is blocking my website from downloading the flash.  For example, you can watch the You-Tube videos on Alex Jones website,  infowars.com,  but it will not allow you to watch or listen to his daily show because it is run by the adobe flash.  I tried using the Firefox browser, but it will not allow the Adobe Flash player to run on that browser.  I have given this tablet a low rating because all tablets should have the capability to run the Adobe Flash player which is a basic tool used to run a computer.  By the way, the Google Play Store will not allow you to download the Adobe Flash player, you have to do it from another website."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00D029NNA", "review": "I bought this tablet on Black Friday. I loved it...  loved it...  loved it... , but now not so much. Everything was just perfect or so I thought. The battery now, 7 months later, charges at a rate of 3% an hour, but burns through the charge much faster. I sent this to Samsung for repair explaining clearly the issue and ten days later I received the tablet back with a new charger. Charged 10% in 3 hours which alerted me the repair shop did nothing. It did charge another 10% in an hour when plugged it again (we are not at 55% charged=4 hours + the 34% remaining from the repair shop). The call to Samsung was almost 90 minutes and I spoke with 3 very nice people and with a supervisor discovered that I could send the table to another authorized repair facility we discovered that regardless of the rules, there isn't another one. Just the same one who took for granted that I am stupid and that the problem is the power cord. Lesson learned: Samsung has a great product when it works, but when it is defective Samsung has your money already and you just  I have to wait. Moral of the Story: Don't buy Samsung unless you live in a perfect world. There are other manufacturers with nice people and better repair records. I own something that is less useful than a brick."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00D029NNA", "review": "I have bought one of these toys. Before doing so, I did a lot of reading. I am a professor and a researcher. I travel a lot and wait long time at airports. My books (library) are in PDF format. So I wished something in 10.1 inches, crispy image, good battery life, micro sd slot (up to 64GB) and Android OS; All these characteristics were mandatory in my list. That's why I avoided other operative systems and other tablets without micro sd card slot. Then I went for the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 (10.1-inch, white) 2013 model and added, right away, a Kingston 64GB micro sdxc class 10-card. Wow!!! Thousands of my pdf books are now filling that little card and accessing and reading them is just perfect.\n\nLittle I knew how addictive this thing is. I think that is one of the reasons why I did not buy the 3G version -and avoid constant internet connection-. As I have told before, I got it for extensive reading and it is perfect for my taste to read my PDF books and papers in this tablet.\n\nAdditionally, watching a video on it is awesome. The quality of the image of the screen is excellent. The sound is powerful and high quality. I consider myself an audiophile. I did installed 2400w of high quality sound in my car. Listening music in this tablet is a pleasure. Those tiny speakers at the sides are not only powerful but they provide beautiful high definition sound for music and video as well.\n\nI will not mention the hundreds and hundreds of android apps available and the friendly this tablet is with the social apps (FB, Line, BBM, Whatsapp, etc). That is common to all Android devices but, anyhow, this tablet is great with all those apps.\n\nIt picks up any wi-fi signal and connects to it quickly and easily. The screen is scratch-proof.\n\nConnecting it to the computer is quickly even without the proprietary software. The computers detect it right away and allow me to access the internal memory and the micro sd card without problem whatsoever.\n\nI have not measure the battery life but it is long enough as for me to read a lot on it on a daily basis, watch a movie every now and then, listen music every now and them and charge it every other day or so.\n\nNow i find myself using this tablet in class instead of my laptop and instead of my printed notes. Thanks to this tablet my last class (doctoral level) was a zero-paper class (I have been teaching for more than 20 years).\n\nI will recommend this tablet to teachers and professors, travelers, internet lovers, media lovers, etc!\n\nI have had it for around a month so far and I am really satisfied with the tablet. It is what I was looking for and I got it."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00D029NNA", "review": "I love this tablet.  I've had it about three weeks and I think it's great.  Now, I know there is a newer model of this item, and I know that this item is not as advanced as some. I know the resolution is rated as 'less than stellar' in a lot of online blogs and reviews.  But for my needs it is wonderful.  I wanted a tablet that would do three things: surf the web and email/facebook, be able to do \"word\" and \"excel\" type things (limited, such as keeping track of a budget in an XL doc, or writing a letter draft), and have a decent screen size so that you can actually see it while you are doing these things.  I got this for travel, and for an upcoming move in which I will not have access to my desktop computer for several months as it will be shipped.  I was looking at and originally wanted an IPad mini, or a refurbished Ipad 2, but when push came to shove, I was not willing to drop the extra cash for the smaller screen or older item when I could get this for a similar price--and I don't regret it at all.\n\nThe cons:  It is true that it is a bit laggy/slow.  But for my needs this is fine.  I'm not a big gamer or anything like that so it doesn't really matter to me if it takes an extra second or two than it would on a different tablet to open the app or game.\n\nThe pros:  Good screen, resolution is just fine IMO--it doesn't look as good as some tablets, but it doesn't look bad, SD card slot for expandable memory and app storage--this is fantastic.  You can add a micro SD card to this tablet for storing apps, photos, files, etc.  I LOVE this feature.  Sound is good, and android runs smoothly on here.  It also has bluetooth connectivity so that you can buy an external keyboard, I am planning on getting one soon.  The onscreen keyboard is fine for typing short things; it should be noted that I don't like any kind of on screen keyboards, so that is why I want the external keyboard.  I can't comment on the camera, as I don't really use it except for video chats (which I haven't tried yet).  The screen size is really nice and you can read on it without squinting or having to enlarge much (though you can).  App store has plenty of apps at least for me, and I like the widgets available.  Overall, very good experience.  Better than I was expecting for the price!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00D029NNA", "review": "I'll update this review later as I do with most electronics because the true test of it spans a few months.\n\nFirst impressions after having it for a week, this is a great tablet; It may not be top of the line, but it works very well for what I need. My last tablet was an Asus Transformer Prime which I bought two and half years ago. Even today the Prime had specs to rival the majority of top tier tablets; quad core processor, plenty of ram and memory, an incredible screen, but it was so damn unstable. It would lag, freeze, WiFi was weak due to the aluminum backing, internet browsing was a chore, and eventually the keyboard became so frustrating and unusable. The camera wiring was shoddy and stopped working a year ago, and the screen finally gave out when I dropped it while it was in a case, in my bag, from a height of two feet or so. I decided I was done with ASUS tablets, and electronics in general from the less reputable companies.\n\nThis Galaxy Tab 3 so far has been a dream to use. It's not really faster, and the screen is actually a lower resolution so it's a little less crisp, but I didn't need something much more powerful and I don't care if app icons look \"a little fuzzy\" as some people complain about. I just needed something from a reliable manufacturer that was stable and fluid. And so far I've gotten exactly that. Still a 10\" screen thats very bright with excellent picture and movie quality, a little smaller, much lighter, switching apps is smooth, it doesn't lag as much, the WiFi signal capability is stronger than my Droid RAZR, and the Samsung UI feels much more polished.\n\nOverall, I'm thoroughly enjoying this tablet. I considered the Galaxy Note 10.1 because it has more memory, 1.5-2GB I believe depending on the model, as opposed to 1GB the Tab 3, but it still runs very fast. I use it for browsing, games, and all my class textbooks, PDFs, and streamed lectures. It runs everything very well. I guess if you have use for the stylus or need the ability to run dual apps side by side, maybe doing a lot of spreadsheets, note taking, and business that requires complete fluidity, maybe go for the Note so you'll never be starved for extra memory to run fast. But the Tab 3 is an excellent tablet for the Value, and I got it for about half the price I paid for my Prime when it was initially released.\n\nUpdate - Feb 2015\nTablet still works well, very reliable, but it is definitely well behind the curve in terms of speed and performance. I usually use it just for studying and the cool Flipboard magazine app. Internet browsing however is kind of a chore but may be because I still use the standard browser. I'll try chrome to see if it smooths it up but in my experience the chrome app is plagued with its own issues. However, at the price you can get a Galaxy Tab 3 now I'd say it's worth it for the general tablet user. Someone needing it for work or school will want something faster now."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00D029NNA", "review": "I really love this tablet.  Setup takes a few minutes like with any new tech device but once you connect your Google account, you're on a roll!  The display is quite good considering the pixel density.  Sound provided by the onboard speakers is really good as well.  Battery life is, like any device, only as good as you are but you have plenty of tools to help manage the power consumption.  The Wi-fi antenna is strong and it can recieve an adequate signal even if your router is less than top-notch.  This is super light and large enough for business applications and games alike.  I love having the IR blaster, this is a better universal remote than anything else and I can't lose this one in the couch cushions!\n\nOne downside to being so light is that it feels a bit flimsy in your hands but it is big enough so you don't feel like you will break it by looking at it wrong.  The rear camera is almost worthless but it isn't meant to be a camera.  The front facing camera works for video calls just fine but you'll need plenty of light.\n\nOverall it's a great little tablet that is worth the price of admission.  It isn't perfect but nothing really is.  More pros than cons in my book, so I score this a win."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00D029NNA", "review": "this is my favorite android tablet. I use it daily. However I will remark that if you only use it for streaming Netflix, the battery will drain faster and faster. I bought two and tested it out by playing Netflix movies until the battery drained to 25%. I did this experiment daily, recharging it every time and at first I had a 6 hour battery life....now it is down to 4.5 hours.\n\nIf you really want a great PC tablet I recommend the Dell 8 Venue Pro. It is faster but the screen resolution for Netflix sucks and Samsung has a really great resolution and color with little buffering problems if any. It all depends on how you want to use the tablet. For Kindle reading, surfing the net and buying very neat android apps, mostly free on amazon, I recommend the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3. If you are only interested in surfing the net and emails, then the Dell PC tablet is faster.\n\nLastly if you purchase this Samsung, go and buy the Amazon Basic case with handle. It fits perfectly and has a great side pocket for all of your toys.and gadgets. I love this case. Its is made of neophane, light weight and works great.\n\nAlso buy the USB adapter. It is a USB Micro-8 to USB A 4-pin. This way you can hook up a flash drive or SD card reader and double or triple your storage. I downloaded all of my movies from DVD to two large SD cards and play movies when on the plane. I highly recommend this adapter. My favorite is one that Walmart sells...\"StarTech com. Model number UUSBOTGADAP. It costs around $4-5 bucks. I ended up buying 4 so I can use it for all of my tablets [Dell and Samsung]. If you order it from Walmart, they will ship to your closest store and shipping is free and you get it within days. Amazon sells their own adapters...just make sure you order a USB Micro-8 to USB A 4-pin. The good thing about StarTech is that is is very small and has no cord....but easier to lose...so buy a backup or two.  Some complaints is that the USB port is on the bottom of the tablet and you can not use a stand because the adapter is in the way. Turn over the tablet! It will still work and the adapter will be on the top, out of the way."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00D029NNA", "review": "Disclaimer: I've only owned this tablet a month and my overall impression of this mobile computing option is \"unimpressed.\"\n\nThe advantages of using a small, fast device should be weighed against the downside: your \"imput interaction\" is considerably more difficult than it is with say, a laptop and I can seldom find a comfortable way to hold the device such that I can type without accidentally covering the wifi antenna, pressing the \"previous screen\" button near the bottom or the \"home\" button (also near the bottom). I left my laptop at home on my recent vacation and regretted the decision daily.\n\nI have had a problem in charging the tablet for about 2 weeks. It takes multiple connection attempts to finally see the unit taking a charge via the wall socket adapter (I have not had the problem when charging via the USB conected to my laptop). Once the charge indicator shows the battery is being charged, it usually takes about 10-15 minutes before the charging stops leaving the unit in a perpetually-undercharged condition. Multiple searches on Google haven't helped me find a solution, so it's possible this is a rare condition. I strongly suspect it's software related, although I have found other charging-related issues with the Tab 3 on the internet that were related to problems with the battery connections."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00D029NNA", "review": "Overall, this tablet is a big hit with me. I bought it after a two-year run with a Blackberry Playbook 7\" Tablet, and for the most part this is a much better experience. There are a lot of things which could (and should) be easily possible with tablets these days which I'm appalled to see that many of them don't do (reading common file formats, etc.) This tablet does most of those things as if it that were just \"how it's done,\" which is exactly what it should do.\n\nWhat I like:\n\nThis tablet comes with removable storage capacity. Whereas more and more companies these days are realizing that people will buy more devices faster if they have to upgrade to the next-largest hard-drive every time they run out of space, it's refreshing to see a MicroSD card slot in a tablet. This is one of those things that, when a company doesn't do it, I think \"really? How can you possibly imagine you'll get away with that?\" Once again, though, here this is not an issue. It's also much more universally compatible than a lot of its competitors. For instance, I can pair my Bluetooth Speaker with it effortlessly, despite the fact that it was made by Skosche and not Samsung. It's agreeable and not finicky.\n\nThen there's the capabilities it gives you with photos. For me, the ability to crop and otherwise edit my photos in the same device that took them is a big deal, and this tablet offers many apps each with various useful options in how to do this. You can also disable location-based services. As a privacy-conscious person, I definitely approve of this, especially when most apps demand permission to view your location, even when they have no need of that information to perform their function. \"GPS\" is one of the options in the top-menu that you can shut-off completely with a single touch.\n\nThen there's the multiple desktops feature. This is one of the reasons I so love Linux OS. I'd like to be able to give each desktop a different wallpaper, but maybe this will be in a future update. Another thing I enjoy is the ability to use the file-browser of my computer to access and change the contents of the tablet's hard drive. I can just drag-and-drop files into folders, which is far and away better than a tablet which requires you to download its proprietary \"desktop manager\" or other corporate software to manage its contents and then be SOL when said software inexplicably malfunctions (I'm looking at you, Apple and RIM!)\n\nAlso, speaking of the lack of corporate meddling, this tablet is a mostly DRM-free-zone. While unfortunately there's copy-protection on a lot of the Play Store media content (like eBooks,) if you tend to get your media from others sources (like downloading music from Amazon or ripping movies from DVDs you own) then you'll find yourself perfectly able to enjoy your own legal right to copy your own files across your own devices on your own terms, and access them on your own terms as well. This NEEDS to become a socio-economic norm, and I applaud any company who already does things this way.\n\nWhat I think could be better:\n\nThe port at the bottom of this device for charging and syncing is TINY. Micro USB is a TERRIBLE choice for something that has to be plugged in and left to charge or sync as often as a tablet, because it really can't take much of a bump without being damaged and becoming unusable. Maybe they think this is somehow a more efficient use of space, or maybe this is more of that \"make it suck so people will have to pay for repairs and replacements more frequently\" phenomena I mentioned, but I would be stoked if they'd just put a regular-sized USB port on it, like they have on the other end of the cable. Smaller is NOT always better, and there's plenty of space on the bottom of this tablet for a standard USB port.\n\nAlso, while this tablet's onscreen appearance is appealingly customizable, you can't change a few things that I'd really like to change. For instance, the drop-down menu that gives access to your WiFi, Bluetooth, GPS, etc options is a really abrasive white-with-black-and-blue-font. The same is true of the options menu. This wouldn't be such a bone-of-contention with me if I could invert or even customize the color scheme, but apparently no one thought of this in designing Jelly-Bean. Unfortunately those colors are really harsh on my eyes, especially if I have to use the tablet at night (and I take night classes, so... yeah.) The least they could do here is create a \"night mode\" that inverts the colors to reduce eye-strain. I'd like to see this as an OS update in the near future.\n\nAlso, this tablet will not communicate with a computer running Linux OS no matter what mode I set it to use. I guess most people don't (yet) use Linux, so this is likely not a problem for you. But considering that Android is *based* on Linux and has many of the features that Linux users enjoy, this should not be happening. I even have a smaller Android tablet (Archos 43) which does not have this problem. But sadly in the case of the Galaxy 3, \"Droid doesn't.\"\n\nOverall, this tablet is a huge improvement in my life and I'm very thankful to have it, despite its aforementioned shortcomings. It's not absolutely perfect by my standards, but it's at least several steps in the correct direction and makes the technological and business aspects of my life overall much easier. I would recommend this tablet."}

It was this tablet that actually made me put down my iPad, which I never thought I could do!  The fact that many of the apps that I used frequently on my iPad where also available with the same or similar experience, made it easy for me to convert!!!  I also loved the fact that many of the book in the Play Store are less expensive!  Okay let's talk features!  This tablet is thin and light compared to my iPad 3, which seems so heavy now.  One of the best tech feature is the option to use a micro SD card slot for extra storage, and of course USB support!  This also means that the cables are much less expensive and I don't have to buy \"special attachments\" for every little thing that would cost me about $40!\n\nIn addition, I love the fact that I can work on Word docs, PowerPoint Slides and excel spreadsheets and then save them to the hard drive or upload them to the Cloud (via Drive).  This is a great feature because I am always working on various documents while on the go!  I am a huge Google user so the setup is very easy and my experience is the same as if I were on a laptop.  I love the Smart Eyes features where the tablet goes to sleep when it can't detect your eyes looking at the screen.  I am still exploring new features everyday.  It took me a long time to figure out how to close the apps running in the background! LOL!\n\nLastly, if you're like me, you still may need a keyboard to really take advantage of this tablet because the SWYPE method can only go so far during dictation!  I purchased the Logitech Bluetooth Keyboard for this tablet and it's like a mini laptop!  The downside to that keyboard that I have learned is that is drains the battery very quickly!  There are various keyboards that you can get to support this tablet, just explore and find the one you like the best!\n\nI have other #Inteltablets, but this Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 is one of my Top 3 picks! #IntelFan"}

At times, the Youtube application would exit after few minutes, and we would have to restart. We though this may be a problem with Samsung Galaxy tab, so we returned it back to Walmart, and bought Samsung Galaxy tab 3 from amazon.\n\nWe noticed the same issues ( camera and Youtube ). Since we only paid $300 when compared with $500 iPad, I thought that we had to deal with these issues. My wife somehow managed it for six months. After six months, we could not charge the Galaxy tab. We contacted the Samsung repair. It took us three calls to get the shipping label for shipping our tablet to the repair center. After two weeks, I got a call from Samsung that we need to pay $150 ( half of what we paid ) to get our tablet fixed. She said that the charging unit of tablet was damaged. If we broke the glass or caused physical damage to the tablet, then I could understand it. How can we damage the charging unit ? She told me that she did not have enough information; she was only there to collect $150 or ship back our tablet.\n\nI suggest that you stay away from this tablet.

Could see screen acknowledge touch but more times than not Tab 3 took FOREVER to respond - camera, gallery, apps, Chrome.  Felt like we were using old fashioned dial-up and waited and waited.  Tab 3 would 'freeze up' and not respond way too often.  Pull up video camera on Tab 3 and 'on' button would not respond from time to time.  Video trim feature failed to respond 3/4 of the time.  WiFi feature snail slow compared to response time on 3G Android phone ... most times Tab 3 never loaded website.  Wanted tablet for easier reading of whatever on screen ... games, websites, etc.  Used video to record sporting events and did a good job when it functioned.  Light weight and easy to hold; protective sleeve included.  Took time to read online manual and liked features of Tab 3 -- shame performance was so poor.  Returned tablet for refund.  Will look at other models."}

It can be a bit slow at times (although not for very long), and the interface can be a bit confusing when you try to get deeper in the workings. I primarily use it to browse the web and watch netflix, and it performs well in these regards (although Netflix will occasionally get stuck \"buffering,\" which I think is more an app issue than tablet issue). I got this tablet specifically for the expandable memory and got a 64GB microsd card with it, which I loaded with movies for trips, which has worked very well.\n\nPros:\n-Beautiful screen\n-Large size\n-Google Play store\n-Home page keeps you up to date on weather, facebook, news, etc.\n-Expandable Memory\n-Easy volume and menu buttons\n\nCons:\n-Occasional slowness\n-Swiping the tablet on can be unresponsive\n-Power cord connects on the bottom of the tablet, so trying to watch movies while travelling can be tricky (flipping works, but then the case will not hold it up"}

But I finally broke down and started using my wife's Galaxy Tab 3 (8 inch) and found that it was easier checking my emails and what-not without having to sit down in front of the computer.  So when I saw this 10.1 inch bad boy I had to have it.  The clarity and ease of use make it a beginners dream.  The ability to go back and forth without any delay, the way that it sets itself up on the initial start-up is very hassle free.  I don't know what else to say at this time other then it is a great little device and that it feels very sturdy and should be able to handle my abuse through the coming years."}

I'm a big apple fan and was skeptical at first, but trying this product out was the best choice I made in electronics in a long time. The OS is wonderful, fully customizable which is such a nice breath of fresh air. The Google Play store is great, every possible app is out there, the possibilities are endless. I am not disappointed in this product at all when it comes to functionality, the camera could have some improvement, but that is the only complaint I really have in this product. Otherwise, I recommend it to first time tablet users, and even apple fan boys like myself. With the apps on the marketplace you can make this tablet work with your apple products as well, which was a huge plus for me."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00D029NNA", "review": "I have own this tablet for about 4 months, and so far I love it!  I use it daily, both for personal and work-related use.  Perfect for checking e-mail, streaming videos, Netflix, browsing the web, etc.  It's superlight, has killer battery life, and a clear, vivid display.  A great alternative to the over-priced iPad.\nI can tell from these reviews, that quite a few people complain about the tablet being sluggish, lacking in general speed or RAM, or that is freezes up.  I have not had ANY problems with my tablet.  In fact, it works much better and more smoothly than my friend's iPad.  Sure, if you have a ton of apps open at the same time, I'm sure it gobbles up the RAM, but with regular everyday usage (say, 4-5 apps open simultaneously) you will NOT have any problems whatsoever.  Seriously, a lot of reviewers complain about the lackluster RAM or sluggish performance, I have not have experienced this at all.  In fact, I'm a happy camper.  Now when the tablet is only 300 bucks, it's an amazing value for the money.  Even though I paid full price, I am still most pleased with my purchase and would warmly recommend it to anyone needing a reliable, light, sharp looking tab for work or pleasure.  Cheers!"}

We just got fed up and ended up connecting the laptop. Also, the adapter plug we bought from Radio Shack for the HDMI cable to the TV did not connect very well and we had to fiddle with it until we got a secure connection. That may have been the fault of the Radio Shack equipment however.  I also wish it had a flash.\n\nOn top of this I am disappointed with its picture taking ability. I hit the \"take a picture\" icon and sometimes it does it right away, and other times it seems to be focusing in and out, in and out, and it takes about ten tries before it will actually take the picture. REALLY INFURIATING!. I don't know if I'm doing something wrong, but surely it shouldn't be that \"iffy\". I'll be phoning Samsung about it when I get back home.\n\nThe most annoying thing about it is that the bezel around the bottom \"back\" and \"menu\" icons is way, way too sensitive (as noted by a CNET reviewer). If you grip the frame anywhere on the bottom it activates one or the other.  If it's not in a case of some kind you have to juggle it when in Portrait mode.  I think it must have been designed to be used in a case.\n\nAnother thing I don't like is that it comes preloaded with a lot of apps that i don't need or want and I can't seem to get rid of them. You can uninstall apps you got from Google Play but not the preloaded Samsung apps, to the best of my knowledge. They take up valuable memory.\n\nOne thing I anticipated using it for, and it was successful in doing, was playing back TV shows and movies downloaded on the laptop then transferred to the mini SD card using a mini card adapter. We bought an adapter for our headphones at Radio Shack and were able to plug two sets in at once so we could both watch while on the bus for 4 hours in Mexico. The Tab 3 worked well for that although I would have liked a little more volume. I will take a previous reviewers advice re the Marley buds.  Good picture though. It seemed to have good battery life too which worked in our favour. It does charge quite quickly and holds it for quite some time.\n\nI also find the layout for Hotmail confusing. Why can't it just give me the same layout I get on the laptop?\n\nAll in all, it was a lot of money for not many uses."}

Everyday, it seems I am getting more proficient with use. I purchased the book \"My Samsung Galaxy Tab 3\" by Eric Butow and that took my understanding and proficiency to another level.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00D029NNA", "review": "I picked up this tablet after being seduced by the screen. It's now going back to the store. But let's have a fair review.\n\nPROS:\n\n* Downright gorgeous screen. It's not exactly iPad Retina display levels, but movies are excellent and so are games. It's bright and the colors are vibrant.\n\n* Battery life. Average use will get me just under two full days before having to be recharged. This is better than my phone. Very nice!\n\n* Free 50gb of Dropbox for 2 years just for connecting it to your account. This was a nice, unexpected bonus.\n\n* Some of the built in applications are much better than what standard Android has. I wish that the standard calendar looked and worked as well as S Planner, for instance.\n\nCONS:\n\n* Very bad hardware specifications. This is an x86 CPU, specifically an earlier-gen Intel Atom. It still runs Android and still runs all your apps, but the performance is just not there. You can access developer mode and tweak some things to get a small boost, but this does little to help.\n\n* Stuttering, lagging, and hitching when doing everyday tasks. If I had to guess, this is probably because the device only has one gig of ram. The builtin system apps will chew about a quarter of that up, and ~700 meg is not hard to burn through with a couple of apps in the background.\n\n* ZERO moddability. Since this isn't an ARM processor like literally almost every other Android device, none of the community modders have bothered to create custom ROMs for this thing. If you want to rid yourself of Samsung's bloatware, good luck. You will not be able to run Cyanogen on this device.\n\nThis tablet is going back to the store to be replaced with either a Nexus 10 or maybe a 7. The improved applications and battery life are not enough to carry the device on its own, and the lag and stutter is unforgivable and infuriating in 2014. This isn't Android 1.0 anymore, and anything less than a buttery-smooth UI is simply not acceptable."}

Since I used the device and was past their return window, I had to deal directly with Samsung Service.\n\nI've spent about 5 hours dealing with passwords, logins, answering the same  questions over and over, holding on the phone etc.  When I finally got a technician to help me, he had no clue what he was talking about!  Seriously.  I explained to him that the card would not click-lock into the device and he insisted that I reset the software.  I did so to no avail then had to reconfigure the device all over again.\nSamsung service is frustrating to deal with!\n\nI'm not particularly upset that the drive was bad.  Hardware problems are infrequent, but they happen.  I'm more frustrated with the amount of time it took me to get resolution (RMA) from Samsung.\nIf you have a problem, service can be a challenge.\n\nMy experience with this product has been good.  The screen is nice and it's pretty easy to use.  Right now I feel their support lacking.\nI mailed the product to SS for service and I'll update SS when they return it.\nUPDATE - Product is dead.  I can't fix it and I dread dealing with CS again.  Buy an Apple."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00D029NNA", "review": "Update - Apr. 13, 2014: 10 stars! I've discovered \"Stephanie\" - well, that's what I call Galaxy's answer to Siri. I may never have to type again. Absolutely love this Galaxy. Compared to the Win 8.1 tablet, this just shines especially with ease of use. BUT, my wife loves the fact that she can use MS Office on the other Windows tablet. That's what makes the world go round.\n\n***\n\nBackground: I've never had a smart phone, so the basics of a tablet are/were foreign to me. I've never had a tablet, and when my 12 year old XP laptop finally was just too slow (three days to boot up, and two seconds to die), I knew my time had come. The closest thing to a tablet was my first generation Kindle Fire(s), and that is no tablet.\n\nI'm as close to being retired as one can get. I spend most of my time hiking in the hills near our home or traveling to western national parks. I always have my camera with me, and on a \"good\" day will take over 500 photos. I come home, plug the SDHC card into my Win 7 PC, and cull and edit (mostly crop) what's left.\n\nWhat my wife and I wanted was a tablet that we could take on vacation, and view our day's shoot, delete the obvious, and leave the rest on the card for editing when we get home.\n\nYou'd think that would be an easy function to accomplish, but as with the \"paradox of choice,\" It wasn't. I would liked to have gone to the Kindle Fire HDX 8\" with 32 GB, but there's no way to view photos. Without a micro SD slot  and not being able to use the micro slot (used for charging and hooking up to a PC) for a card reader, the Kindle becomes once again an e-book reader. (All this confirmed by Amazon.)\n\nAs I was trying to find the best tablet, i.e., one with a micro-USB slot, I also started thinking that I wanted access to all my Kindle books and apps. Long story short: the Galaxy Tab 3 fit the bill almost to a \"T.\" The only problem was that I didn't know how to use a tablet.\n\nI got the Galaxy Tab 3 at BBY where Samsung has a \"station\" and a very knowledgeable staff. The price was the same as Amazon, and the convenience of having them set it up in 45 minutes while I watched was too much to pass up. I did get a very nice case from Amazon to protect my investment. The cass is important\n\nOnce I played around with it, and of course, plugged in a micro-mini SDHC card with all my music, I got the hang of things very quickly. All my books are accessible, and I also downloaded the 12 apps I use most often, using the AmazonApp app, the Kindle app and the other Amazon app (or was that one a widget?).\n\nBeing retired, I don't need much. (All software such as ACDC, Word, Excel, and Eudora Pro are on my PC.) I wanted speed, a larger screen, and wi-fi access. When we're on vacation, I will use wi-fi access at a motel or lodge for checking the news periodically, but mostly it's photography, app word games, and reading. And I have an emergency email account, and an old cell phone in the car.\n\nPROS: There are many pros to the Galaxy Tab 3, the first one being the micro SD slot. My wife and I have the same cameras, and can also used a 64 GB micro-mini SDHC Class 10 card in them (enough for two week vacations usually), and read directly with the micro SD slot OR plug in a card reader using a micro USB plug to USB 2.0 reader. It's fast enough though the slot is much faster. We can delete the obvious failures, and put the cards back in the cameras for the next day's shooting.\n\nBattery life is about 10 hours! In my experience with all things rechargeable, that's incredible!\n\nI haven't found all the capabilities yet. This is a simple, yet complex tablet, and there's much to learn. But I know which apps I'll use and which can be hidden (some can't be deleted), and which widgets are useful. While I won't take pictures with the Galaxy, I will use the tablet for Skyping friends and family all over the world. As a retiree, I also use the planner for doctor's appointments, play music all the time (I have wondered why have a PC, and then I remember I still have a few clients, and a corporate email program), and even watch a little TV ... or have it handy while watching real TV when I need information from Wiki or Google etc. The Galaxy Tab 3 is 5 times faster than my Kindle Fire.\n\nCONS: Any cons? Yes, four at least.\n\nFirst, the screen is a bit bright for reading, although I can manually darken it. The auto-bright feature doesn't work all that well. On the other hand, I do love ready my Kindle books on a 10 inch screen.\n\nSecond, the 10 inch tablet, though light enough, is a bit unwieldy. The Kindle 7 or 8 is more comfortable. On the other hand, I bought a MoKo Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 Case for $20, and it has a \"handle\" on the back which makes holding the tablet comfortable and easy.\n\nThird, there are three navigation buttons on the bottom or, if held in portrait mode, on the left. My thumb is - so far - constantly touching either the \"Back,\" \"Home,\" or \"Menu\" button. That is annoying especially when the tablet goes to a different page when you're online, or reading a book, etc.\n\nLast, there is no Mute button or volume control that is easily accessible. Yes, there is a volume control on the top left (if in landscape mode) between the SD slot and the Off button. I would like a shortcut on the screen to control volume (also complain I have about the old Kindle). It seems that Samsung thinks that the tablet should work like a smart phone and that automatically muting when a call comes in will solve everyone's problem. If anyone knows of an app that will mute or control the volume easily, please let me know. I've tried 11 Volume Apps - all evidently made for muting when a call is being received - and none of them work.\n\nMini-Issue: Why is the brown (mine's black) more expensive than white??? I know that white makes reading more difficult because of contrast, and it gets dirty faster, but 90% of both will be in a leather case anyway.\n\nOriginally, I was going to give this 5 stars, but that was because having a real tablet was a unique and (almost) enjoyable experience. I focused on what was so great, and not the issues that would and do bug me. So, it's 4 stars from me though if I were to do it over again, I'd still get the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1.\n\nFootnote: In a couple of weeks, I'll have more than a Kindle to compare it to. The day after I bought the Galaxy, I was given an 8 inch tablet with 32GB. Stay tuned.\n\new"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00D029NNA", "review": "What a wonderful WiFi tablet! I love my Tab 3 10.1, as it is just what I wanted in every way, so I just had to share my positive experiences with the Tab 3 10.1 with you. You see I own the Tab 3 10.1 3G version (with the phone part and the ability to get data). These are the same tablet with one exception: The P5200 one has a SIM slot and therefore you can make phone calls and get onto the Internet with your data plan should you have a data plan.\nThis one is a WiFi only one with no Sim card slot. Both work just great and are the same tablet, but this is WiFi.\n\nPROS:\n\n+ Screen Resolution/Weight/Size etc - The first thing I noticed is that side by side (comparing the Tab 2 10.1 and Tab 3 10.1 in weight and size is that the Tab 3 has same screen size, but overall size is a bit smaller and it is so much LIGHTER and easy to carry around than my old Tab 2 10.1! This model has a very colorful and vivid screen. In fact, I can now comfortably hold it in one hand to read a book in portrait, so I appreciate this Tab 3 of being less in weight! And I love the HOME BUTTON.\nNote: To take a quick Screen Shot, press the Home Button (and hold it down) and press the Power Button. You will hear the click of the camera. Your screen shot is in MyFiles under Pictures, Screenshots.\nThis is so handy if you want to take a picture of say a quick map or something like that...\n\n+ WiFi Connection and Range - This tablet is AMAZING at how quickly it connects to my home router or other hot spots - just seconds! And there is a very strong signal on the WiFi on this tablet. So I went outside in the backyard and had 3.5 stars.\n\n+ OS - Jelly Bean 4.2.2 comes with this unit, I find very easy to use and this tablet is very fast in opening apps, going  to Websites etc.\n\n+ Ability to turn off the apps I did not want (helped my battery life). Did an actual test today to see if this made a difference and it did. After I safely turned off the apps that are safe to turn off, I now have more free memory and my battery life per hour has increased. So I documented this. If you have any questions about this, please ask in the comment section. Just a little tweak like this can really make a difference in battery lasting longer and better control over the memory etc.\n\n+ Internet & Webpage & Video Viewing - The stock browser does a great job, however, I use Maxthon Browser and installed archived flash so I have great internet flash video viewing results and it renders webpages quite fast for me. And I suggest the free app called Pocket from the Playstore so you can read internet articles later offline.\n\n+ Watching Flash Videos - This device does not come with installed flash, however, I found a workaround to solve this. So if you request it in the comments, I will send you instructions on how to installed Archived Flash so you can watch flash videos and what proper browsers I recommend for this tablet...The only browsers that I could get the Archived Flash to play on and well was Maxthon Browser or Puffin Browser for 2.99 in the Playstore.\n\nOther Browsers I use when not watching flash: When I want to NOT watch flash, I like Boat Mini or Opera Mini because they use LESS BATTERY and LESS MEMORY, but they are just quick and basic browsers.\n\n+ EXTERNAL SLOT FOR MICRO SD CARD up to 64GB - Note that this was one of the deciding factors that sold me on this tablet. *Keep in mind where External SD cards are concerned: They are JUST for your personal files: music, videos, photos, and other files. When you install apps from the Playstore or other sources, they store either in INTERNAL SD Card area or the main internal area.\n\n+ On-Screen Keyboard / Bluetooth Keyboard Stand I suggest - The on-screen one is so so, however, I use the OXA Bluetooth Keyboard and it basically turns my Tab 3 into a mini laptop as I can get some serious work done on this tablet (using Kingsoft Office for creating Word, Excel etc docs) with it and it types much like my regular laptop keyboard does so I love it! And it has an built in stand for my Tab 3 and it fits my other tablets. This lets me fold my tablet down in it and I keep them both in a 10 inch sleeve.\nIf you want the link for this keyboard (it came from Amazon) and also I have another Bluetooth one I like with this tablet that uses AA batteries, but the OXA is by far the one I use DAILY!!!\n\n+ Bluetooth Accessories - The speaker on this tablet is pretty good. However, I use a very good mid sized Bluetooth Speaker with it to play my music and to watch my movies etc that also came from Amazon. The sound is superb with this Bluetooth Speaker. For best enjoyment of music, a Bluetooth speaker is recommended for this tablet. Let me know if you need my list of accessories for this tablet including Bluetooth items. Every Bluetooth item such as keyboards, speakers or headsets, and other Bluetooth devices, paired and connected to this device right away with no problems.\n\n+ Camera / Video Camera - Although I do not use this as a regular camera (no flash and low resolution), I went outside and took some very clear pictures, I was pleased with the results! Then I took some videos inside and outside to test this and they are much clearer than I thought they would be. So in a pinch, I will use this as as camera.\n\n+ Home Videos - The stock video player is OK and plays MOST home videos, however, may I suggest QQ Player (Free App from Playstore and the ONLY one I recommend as it plays every home video I tried).\n\n+ Reading/Creating/Editing Word, Excel, Text Files and much more on this tablet: This comes with a So So Office app (viewer) for reading Office documents, however, I STILL prefer Kingsoft Office which is a free app from Playstore. It is the best I have ever tried and I am very picky about so called Office programs. It is very compatible with MS Office as it reads, edits and creates Office files and reads PDF files, and it has more features of any other Android Office program that I tried. This app is a MUST have for tablet owners in my opinion.\n\n+ Music Player/Sound Quality - Stock player has clear sound through the outside \"speakers\" and very clear using headphones. To sync easily with Windows Media Player may I suggest the Playstore app free) WinAmp for the tablet as it is very highly rated and the sound is good, but I use a very high quality Bluetooth speaker for great sound! Suggestions: The best way to really enjoy music is through a high quality Bluetooth speaker or Bluetooth headset as the sound quality is superb this way and you can walk about your home listening to your music!\n\n+ Battery Life- Since I have done a few tweaks on this tablet, now I have found that my battery life is better than the first and even the second day. In fact, the battery life now I find that when I use WiFi just when I need it, I now get about 6 to 8 hours with it(this reflects 100 percent brightness however). Still this is better than I received on my older Tab 2, so I am happy.\n***Where battery life is concerned: To make your battery last as long as possible is to be sure to turn off BLUETOOTH AND WIFI when you do not need these. Both are these are memory hogs! Also, I turn off my GPS and even SYNC sometimes to conserve battery and then turn them on later.\n\n+ OTG USB Compatible - You can add an optional OTG (On the Go adapter cable to the Micro port for copying files to your flash drive and from your flash drive to the Tab Pro). You can also plug in a mouse, I tried it and it worked. *Note that portable external hard drives and portable DVD/CD drives will not work using OTG in the TabPro because these both require a lot of power to be compatible with the Tab Pro and most tablets that have the OTG. However, it is still good to know that you can easily plug in your flash drive and copy files to the Tab Pro and from Tab Pro to PC--what a time-saver.\n\n+ Bluetooth Speed and Performance - The Bluetooth keyboard I own paired quickly with several devices and copied files at a great rate of speed. Speaking of Bluetooth: Also there will be Bluetooth keyboards out for the Tab Pro coming soon. (Just make sure you purchase one for JUST THE TAB Pro 10.1 size).\n\nCONS: (Just one con I found, however, this con is NOT the fault of Samsung)\n- New Adobe Flash is not supported; however, I found that archived flash gets the online videos to play. So I downloaded the older archived flash which gives me the ability to view many internet videos.\n\nBottom line: Would I buy this combo phone and tablet model over again? Yes in a heartbeat as it has a VIVID and CLEAR display, this tablet is also very responsive and has even exceeded my expectations of it. This is a wonderful tablet and I like the fact that the OS looks like other Android OS like the S3 and S4 etc. Should you consider purchasing this tablet? In my opinion YES if you have Android tablet experience and want to have these nice pros!\n\nWell, I hope that this review has been of help to you and thank you for reading it. Also, since I am somewhat of a techie person, I will be happy to answer any questions you may have through the comment section."}

He also got a cover for it, which makes it easier to carry around with confidence that you won't break it.  As for me?  Well, I needed a picture of a walrus to draw onto a cake, and he found one for me, and set this tablet up so I could use it as a model.  The display stayed bright for quite some time without me poking it.  I liked that."}

It has a beautiful display, is easy to use, and it partners very nicely with my other Samsung devices.  However...now that I've had it awhile, I've learned that many of the things I want to use it for don't work on this device:  it won't run flash no matter how you install it; it won't run the \"TV anywhere apps that are available as part of my TV service package, nor will it run ESPN3 via my internet provider, and so I'm getting far less capability from this device than I had hoped for.

I know you get what you pay for but come on, I really got ripped off.  I paid $100 for my Samsung phone and can make calls and see videos on face book.  I paid $413.00 for the Samsung Galaxy Tab and can do everything I can do on the phone minus the calls,and videos.  I purchased the tablet so I could carry it with me and open my emails and see the video's of my grand daughter who lives in the UAE, the tablet does not allow that.  I tried to Skype with my daughter to see my grand daughter and for some reason I can't get through.  The entire thing is a glorified phone app without access to the telephone.  I have a Samsung Galaxy 3 phone and the screen, menu and functions are the exact same.  I am very disappointed and will be returning the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 for a refund."}

I highly recommend it!\n\nTwo things I wish Samsung would fix... 1.)  provide a longer chord so you can sit further away from an outlet... and 2.) WHY WHY WHY do they put the charger at the bottom of the device (instead of the top or side) where the base of the folding covers are?  Make it hard to continue to charge while watching/doing things at the same time.  But these two pet peeves are with most devices on the market and wouldn't keep me from purchasing it again."}

I'm a Windows geek so Android as always been a bit of a stranger to me. I found this was easy to set up and after getting used to the controls quite easy to use. If you're at all familiar with Android you'll love it.\n\nUPDATE:\nAfter owning it for a little while she's still pleased with it's speed and ease of use. Two things however have been perceived issues:\n1. The lack of a flash unit for the camera. To me that's not a big issue as this is generally not my first choice for taking photos. To my wife that's another story.\n2. The lack of cellular connectivity. If there is no WiFi available your off the grid.\nOverall I find this to be another stellar Samsung product only slightly limited by the above."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00D029NNA", "review": "I got this as an early Christmas present back in December 2013.  Since then I have had to turn it in twice to the warranty repair.  The power meter doesn't stay connected to the device.  One day I just pressed the power button and nothing happened after charging it for over 12 hours and this was just about four weeks after the purchase date.  It was repaired by Samsung, they did a hard drive re image and shipped it back to me within the required 14 day period.  When I got it back it was slow and laggy until I downloaded the required updates.  Then about five days after receiving it back I went to turn it on and nothing happened again.  Also, again, this was after a full 12 hour charging period.  We called Samsung to ask for our money back or a brand new device and they told us we would have to ship it in two more times in order to get a brand new device, so much for their, \"We fix it right the first time\" moto.  I am confused because all the reviews on this device are very positive when you are shopping for it and do not mention this being a common issue.  However, when I went on a few forums this seems to be a common problem.  If I were you I would keep your receipts and make sure you try it out for a few days before throwing them away.  This device is not very stable at all..."}

Using a blue-tooth keyboard is easy and the tablet responds quickly to the keyboard.  Adding additional memory is easy.  The speakers are excellent, sound is full and brilliant.  The application libraries from both Samsung and Google are both extensive and the ones I use have never caused issues with the tablet.  I highly recommend this tablet as a great alternative to an iPad."}

It will run all your apps flawlesly but maybe if you want a gamming tablet you should go for some of the quad core ones. But they normally use tons of battery.\n\nThe screen is nice and bright, very sharp.\n\nOverall I'm happy with my purchase :)"}

This tablet also supports SD cards for expandable storage which my previous Kindle Fire HD did not (and still doesn't). It comes with a rapid charger, which is an extra expense with the Kindle.  It also came with some pretty cool freebies, like free Hulu for 3 months, and credit in the Google Play store.  The best feature is that it is compatible with all other Samsung products should I ever get a smartphone I can tap them to share the address book instead of hand entering.  I also love the simplicity of using the camera on this tablet.  If you have ever tried to take a picture of something with your Kindle Fire you know exactly what I mean.  It is nearly impossible to take a picture of anything except yourself.  I don't do self portraits.  It is very easy to navigate as well.  Well worth the money I spent on it."}

I bought this as a replacement for the HP Touchpad my wife had been using for years. While the touchpad was a great device and worked very well and we never had an issue with it, but the OS was outdated and there are only a handful of apps to use on it. The big deal with any tablet is the apps you can download and Android has a few more than the WebOS. The tablet is thin, light-weight, user friendly, so overall it is a good buy if you can shop around and get it on sale somewhere."}

Also I find the tablet to be a little larger than what I would like.  it doesn't quite fit well in anything I have (i.e. purse) and can be at times a little awkward I wish I had gotten the size smaller.  However I'm not a tech person and it seems to be a great device."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00D029NNA", "review": "Got this because of a gift card. Did not particularly care for the ipad of my wife. But thought I would get this. Glad I did. The ability to add a 64gb sd card and then a bluetooth keyboard has made this one of the most versatile tools to do the things I want. In addition, apps galore. Downloaded kingsoft office and now can do my MS files on it too. If you want to have something versatile and a good basic tool this is it. If you want something more high powered probably not. Down side is the button at bottom can get touchy. Speakers are not as good as an Ipad. But when you plug in earbuds and use the adapt sound feature to set up based on your hearing capabilities, it puts out some awesome sound. Look for the deals on amazon to get this set up for some cheap bucks. My complete setup was less than the cost of an ipad."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00D029NNA", "review": "So when I started  researching tablets I was completely clueless and wasn't really interested in purchasing one for myself. however this is what my girlfriend had wanted for Christmas, so I had recruited the help of a techie friend of mine. I wanted a tablet that had a decent amount of internal storage for what she was going to use it for and also one that wouldn't lag down like a cellphone once you loaded too many apps on it. Also price was a contributing factor to my decision. I have never been an apple fan so i decided to look at the android operating systems, which gave me a larger selection of options. When it came down to the end it was a choice between the Surface 2 and the galaxy tab 3. The processors were comparable as well as the storage and price. The decision was tough but it basically came down to the fact the Samsung paired fairly easy with my girlfriends cell phone so it would load all of her apps, contacts, etc without me having to do all the work for her as she is not real tech savy. But in summary I am more than impressed with the Samsung's capabilities and smooth operation. Very easy to use and I would recommend it as a very sound cost effective option for the Techy, and Not-so-Techy person."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00D029NNA", "review": "While this table looks beautiful, is great to hold, feels solid and looks great on boot-up, that's where its usefulness ends. Loading up a few apps makes you realize that a tablet that merely looks good is not enough. Try Skype and you will find that the thing can't do it, what is more googling \"Skype Samsung Galaxy Tab 3\" and you'll see that thousands of others have complained about this too. So OK you might say, so much for communicating with Grandma - lets try something else. You then load up an app to watch videos from europe, well that doesn't work either. OK so now lets try watching a flash video online - well outta luck there too.\n\nSo far all the reasons for buying this tablet have evaporated, and in typical Samsung style they don't give a f*** that their user experience sucks. As you try to figure out what is wrong you start looking at what is under the hood, and you realize that this tablet is exactly the same as the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 except that they downgraded the processor to some junky intel thing that  causes shorter battery life.\n\nSo my recommendation give this tablet a wide berth and if you are unfortunate enough to have bought one, return it quickly. So in short this would have received 4 stars if any of the applications I had bought this for had worked. If they had put in a decent processor rather than this intel Atom thing then it might have received 5 stars. Given that it is a very beautiful piece of glass right now and unfit for any task I can't really give it any higher rating."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00D029NNA", "review": "I have had this tablet for over a month now, and am very happy with it!  I have a Samsung Galaxy Nexus phone, so the sync capability obviously is a key part of the experience.  I am an Android user and wanted a tablet with an Intel processor, so this tablet was perfect for me.  I am not a very 'techy' person, so i actually let this sit in it's box for over a month before i decided to go through the typical painful set-up process.  However, this tablet was VERY quick and easy to set-up and sync to my Google accounts, etc.  I didn't even have to ask my husband to help, as normally when I get a new phone, i give it to him to set up for me.  The tablet interface is easy to use, my only complaint is I can't minimize or shrink windows so to have multiple windows side-by-side.  Or if there is a way to do this, i haven't figured it out yet.  But you can obviously have multiple aps running at the same time, and easy to move between them.  It's nice to have the larger screen to do all the normal multi-tasking I would use my phone for.  Example is last week I was sitting on my couch, watching Thurs night football, using the tablet to monitor my fantasy football team, was also doing online Christmas shopping, managing Sonos (playing in the background), catching up w/ Words with Friends, and an occasional game of the Jewel Blitz game (addictive!).  This tablet has a good-sized screen, light-weight, runs fast, and battary lasts a decent period of time.  For the price, a great tablet!  highly recommend!"}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00D029NNA", "review": "I would like to give this unit the five star rating that I give my 7 inch Tab 2,  but I can't.  The buttons shown on the bottom get in the way when used in the portrait position.  Kindle books are best read in that position,  so you have to be very careful where you hold the device along the edges, or you will be back to the apps screen.  Also the edges are too pressure sensitive causing strange things to happen,  just when you don't want them to.  Now if you buy a tablet cover case,  you may be able to avoid some of these problems, depending on the case.  Sitting  upright in the landscape position (in tablet cover) with a stylus being used,  this unit works remarkably well.  But if you want to lie on the counch and read a Kindle book,  I would choose another unit.  I know I will prefer my 7 inch Tab 2 for that purpose.\n\nAs for kids, I have several grandkids who couldn't wait to get their hands on the unit.  But they keep hitting the back and home keys.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00D029NNA", "review": "Over a period of several weeks I tried out the following.  (I will post this same review in Amazon under each device.)\n\n1. ASUS Transformer T100 hybrid tablet/notebook \n2. Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 Tablet\n3. Google Nexus 10 tablet\n\nI also looked at an iPad Air.  They are way overpriced.  And I still have a grudge against Apple for the 2012 hard drive recall they had on our 27\" iMac.  It was a total disaster.  We didn't lose any data but it took weeks and endless phone calls to get it running right again.\n\nAfter spending a day getting used to Windows 8, I thought the ASUS might be the one I was going to keep.  I actually only tried it for two days.  Early on day three I shut it down only to have it remain on the \"Shutting Down\" screen for an extended time period.  So I powered it off.  Apparently, my bad.  Subsequently it would not reboot into Windows, reset or repair even after talking with ASUS Tech Support.  They asked me to return it to them for repair.  I declined and returned it to Wally\n\nI liked the ASUS.  It was attractive but a fingerprint magnet both front and back. And it was more difficult to use than Android.  The two issues that bothered me most were the lack of a Swype app and the complications of dictation.  The best Swype-type app in the Windows Store is TouchPal.  It ain't that good.  First of all the virtual keyboard is large. Your finger has to cover a lot of real estate to enter characters.  Also, the word prediction accuracy sucks. Windows-supported dictation was not that accurate, so I had to go into Google to dictate.  This was not nearly as handy as being in a Google operating system to begin with.  I use Swype and dictation a lot.\n\nThe mentioned issues relate to Windows 8 not the physical unit.  I liked the ASUS unit enough that I discovered they make several similar models running Android.  After checking these out I found they were either running old versions of Android or cost a couple of hundred dollars more than the two Samsung models mentioned here.  So, that ended that.\n\nIt was hard to choose between the Nexus and the Galaxy,  Both are made by Samsung.  I waited several weeks to see if a new Nexus 10 was coming out but to no avail.\n\nAs far as looks go, the Galaxy is very thin and attractive.  In my opinion it is as nice looking as an iPad even though it has more plastic.  I had the white one so fingerprints were not that visible.  The Galaxy gets compliments for its narrow bezels.  However these are really a functional negative. They cause you to touch and activate stuff on the screen accidentally quite often.  Makes me suspect the iPad has the same problem.  There are a lot of complaints about the large area of sensitivity for the three built-in keys at the bottom of the Galaxy.  However I thought this was minor compared to the narrow side bezels.  (You can probably negate the side bezel problem by putting the unit in a folio case. It could give you more to hang onto.) The speakers are on the top of the sides and are easy to cover up when holding the unit.\n\nThough made by Samsung, because Google's name is on it the Nexus is first in line for Android updates. It has already downloaded the latest Android version, KitKat.  It will also be the first to get future updates since there is no manufacturer software OS overlay to wait for.  It is pure Android--no bloatware.  In terms of specs, the Nexus blows the other two units away.  The broad bezels may not be as attractive but they give you something to hang onto without accidental screen touches.  The Nexus' rubber-like coating on the back is better for grip and not a fingerprint magnet.  Less bling but more practical. The Nexus' speakers are on the on the front, the best place.\n\nEven though I did not keep the Galaxy and its specs are much less impressive than the Nexus, I found it perfectly satisfactory for my needs.  I do mainly Web browsing, Email, some text and spreadsheet documents and a few non-graphic intensive games. I bought all of these units from local big box stores.  The Nexus 10 was $400 and the other two units were only about $30 less.\n\nAfter considerable researching of portable Bluetooth keyboards, I ordered and just received a Kensington KeyFolio Pro 2 Universal Case and Keyboard.  I bought this from Amazon and will review it when I have had it for awhile.  So far this looks like a terrific and attractive accessory  I will probably keep the Nexus in the protective case without the keyboard most of the time.  I will use the keyboard when I do a lot of data entry."}

The tablet is incredibly snappy, switching between apps like a champ.  You would think that all of that processing power would come at a cost to battery life but that's not true.\nI had a Google Nexus 7 that I bought when they first came out.  Its a good little tablet but its a little small for reading magazines on.  The 10.1 screen of the Tab 3 is a much better form factor for reading magazines on (more legible screen).  I was also amazed at the incredible battery life that I got with the Tab 3 compared to the Nexus 7.  With the Nexus 7 I was charging the tablet almost daily.  With the Tab 3 I am able to go days if not a full week (depending on how I am using it).  With the Nexus 7 I was having a lot of issues with keeping it connected to my wireless N in the house.  It would stutter a lot while trying to watch video on.  I actually had to create a guest wireless account with it locked at wireless G speeds only for it to stay connected.  With the Tab 3 I was able to connect to the wireless N without any issues.  It even connects to the 5Ghz band without issues.  I am able to stream HBO Go and shows from my Directv Genie system.\n\nI would highly recommend this tablet to anyone looking for a good android based 10.1 inch tablet."}

I've gone back and forth between ios and android, and am currently in a serious Apple phase (laptop, phone etc.). However, the iPad doesn't allow you to expand the storage and it doesn't have a USB port, so that I can easily transfer music and pics more quickly than over WiFi. My one complaint thus far is that it is very slow surfing compared to my Macbook Pro or even my iPhone running over the same WiFi. It's kind of frustrating, but it get's the job done. I'm taking this little baby to Europe in place of my laptop, so we'll see how it works across the pond. I think that if you're looking for something in a reasonable price range that is easily accessible and easy to learn, this is a good option. The size is also great as well. I was seriously torn between the 8\" and the 10.1\". The 10.1\" is closer to an iPad in size. Also, it's still small enough to through into a purse/bag. It can't fit in a pocket, but if you plan to use this for more than just reading a novel, you'll appreciate the larger size-still very light.  I'm enjoying it thus far. Additionally, I'm young, but I have very poor eyesight. I appreciate that I was able to increase the font as soon as I turned it on."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00D029NNA", "review": "I originally was pretty excited when I got this tablet. I only had it two days before I exchanged it. The reasons for doing so are small, but they annoyed me to no end. The first thing is the actual hardware buttons for the home screen and back. It wasn't an issue too much in landscape mode, but I was constantly hitting the back button when in portrait mode. In addition, the button is fairly sensitive so sometimes it would graze against my shirt and it would go back. My second gripe was that it's only a duo-core. That's not much of an issue in and of itself, but when you can get a quad core for cheaper it convinced me to exchange. I ended up exchanging it for the lenovo ideatab s600, and I'm fairly happy with the exchange.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00D029NNA", "review": "Our family bought an ipad2 almost 2 years ago and since every one wants to use it I am getting tired of it.  So over the Thanksgiving weekend we bought this (with the $100 off from Costco) as it was on sale.  So far here are the differences we noticed:\n1) The ipad2 is more responsive when it comes to selecting things.  I shop alot at Kohls and it was horrible how I can't get anything sorted because I can't get it to register my touch.\n2) We can actually use this as a GPS (we tried it out, he ipad we have has only WIFI).  This is a plus because our GPS just broke and we were thinking of replacing it (and now we don't).\n3) I miss facetime (but supposedly there is other substitute for it which we have not tried).\n4) I use the ipad before with the abc app to sometimes catch up with shows I miss.  The abc app on this is lousy (it would stop working in the middle of it) and the quality of the picture is not so good.\n5) we don't think this supports the international keyboard (we really like to get the kids to practice writing Chinese words on the ipad which they don't really do but the functionality is there)\n6) there are apps that supposedly support microsoft documents like powerpoint and words.\n7) Both don't have flash player support\nSo currently I'm using this to play games and check mails and web browsing.  I would have liked it much better if I can watch shows but right now I have to steal the family ipad or use a laptop instead for that."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00D029NNA", "review": "But for two issues this would be an easy 5 star rating.  The control buttons are located on the front of the tablet which means that you frequently inadvertently hit one and you go back or to the home page.  This happens most when using it as an ereader or while playing games.  Once you have done this a bunvh of times you do become careful how to hold the tablet.  The power and volume controls are inbedded in the side and I eventually will remember where they are and not keep turning the tablet over and around.\nThe second issue is that it is not compatible with the adope flash reader so you cannot watch Amazon video content.  There are numerous companies that you can get movies from but I was considering Amazon prime.\nTablets now are like vhs and beta back in the old days, eventually there will be dome consistency amoung the manufacturers.\nThe picture is fabulous, it is easy to use and the keyboard is the best of any tablet I tried.  I like the 10.1 inch size even though it is bulky to carry, the benefits far outweigh the detriment.\nAdded note:  If you need more storage it is far easier to add a micro sd card when you can catch them deeply discounted (many were 70-80 percent off for Black Friday, etc.)  For $23.00, I added 32gb of storage.  Had I purchased the model with the additional storage it was around 100.00 more.  The trick is to find the sale on the micro card.  Staples will price match Amazon, and I always check Amazon's prices before I shop as they are usually unbeatable."}

I assumed that it was the hotels routers, but my wife had no problem with her iPad.  I looked up the issue on the Internet, and found that the Galaxy Tab wifi is very slow when you are far away from the source of the signal, the router.

The pictures and videos are clear, it responds quickly, and it is light and easy to handle. It took me a few weeks to get used to using it, as some things are different from computers, but now I am very glad I bought it. Being able to use a micro SD card and a regular USB flash drive (with the help of an adapter--that you have to buy separately--with a tiny plug on one end for the port on the tablet and a regular-size USB plug-in for the port in your computer), I can carry around any number of books and other things I want to see on the tablet. Tablet-savvy people here probably know this already, but there is also an inexpensive device (Sabrent's Multi-card Reader) that you can plug into a USB port on your computer in order to read any of several sizes of micro cards, which is nice if you have made videos with the tablet and want an easy way to get them into your computer. You can also use Drop Box to do that, but transferring videos through Drop Box takes a long time.\n\nI am sure that as I go on using this tablet, I will discover more interesting things to do with it, but at this point, I am so happy with my purchase that when my husband more or less took over the 10.1\" tablet, I went out and bought myself a Samsung Galaxy Note 8. Which I also like very, very much."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00D029NNA", "review": "bought a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 inch tablet a couple of days ago.  I was adding it to a Lenovo W520 Thinkpad, X220 Thinkpad, Gen 1 iPad, home built desktop, and an iPhone 5.  I have been with the iPhone for 12 months coming from an Android HTC Sensation 4G that I had for 3 years, so am not totally unfamiliar with the Google OS for android devices.\n\nI also should preface this with the fact that I still am very actively at work and mostly use these devices for profitable work product.  My main work effort is keeping in contact with and being available to about 500 clients for advice when they need and want it, which results in needing to accurately keep up with 800 or so contacts.  I only say this so you understand that my primary need for the device was as a larger iPhone clone to keep in contact and read email and get client info right away when I need it and to replace my aging iPad Gen 1.\n\nMy main source of client data and email is my Outlook 2010 although I also have a Hotmail account, GMail account, Yahoo account, and an Exchange account.  The proliferation of calendars, and contacts folders across multiple accounts and multiple devices is a nightmare and I have yet to find any cloud device that doesn't cause more problems in that management task than it solves.\n\nUnfortunately I must add the Galaxy Tab 3 to that list of failed devices.  The iPad Gen 1 although now ancient and the iPhone will with some trouble sync using iTunes with Microsoft Outlook. This is the main folder I use for my important contact data.\n\nAlthough it has been said by Google that you can use Google as an interface between your Microsoft and your Apple devices for contact management it is simply not true.  After nearly 12 concentrated hours of cleaning up and synching my multiple devices in to a clean concise Outlook.pst and Outlook.csv file, I was totally unable to get that file into the Samsung tablet although I had no problem importing it into Google as a comma delimited file.  I tried to import the Google contacts into the Samsung Tablet and although that works on any of the PCs or the Desktop through Google, I was unable to get the Google accounts showing on the Samsung tablet to show any of the 800 contacts at all.  Yet GMail would come onto the Tablet as would my other email.  It is important to also note that fact that the amount of email I get completely overwhelmed the Tablets email applications ability to show and organize it.\n\nI than tried Kies to download the Contacts, Calendar and Tasks.  Absolutely no go.  Given the number of accounts I have I need to pick the specific Main Outlook PST file to sync over to the Samsung with Kies.  Once you check the box for Selected Outlook folders, Kies will freeze up and not show the choices of folder to select for the download.  Several times after walking away from the tablet for over 30 minutes it would finally show the selection of the appropriate folder, but than would download about 4 iterations of each of the 800 contacts and 3200 contacts in a single contacts folder with only 800 discrete files is not what I would call successful\n\nI would think this Samsung device is wonderful for folks that are not looking to spend Apple iPad money and want to mainly use the tablet for music, photos, and games and a small set of contacts and a few emails a day, but it certainly is not for someone that has a lot of data and emails they need to keep close track of.\n\nIt has been reset and it going back to the store.\n\nWK"}

My  Tab 2 started malfunctioning with the upgrade to JELLY BEAN 4.2.2 as it did with a number of others. Apparently this happened with many others who also own Tab 3's. Samsung says it's not their problem; it's Google's. Two separate techs at Google  told me Google DOES NOT RECOGNIZE SAMSUNG TABLETS on their accepted list, and they don't support a number of functions--Google Wallet stopped working, the Tablet would turn itself back on after shutdown.

The screen is super sensitive, but you end up triggering the back button a lot on accident. I dropped it on the back with the case on and it shattered the screen so i'll tell you that it's definitely not very durable and repairs are really expensive. The tablet only has 1 gig of ram so it results in some heavy lag from time to time. I use it in class to take notes; both in handwriting and typing. Very often it takes a few seconds for what you put in to show up. If you close an app there is a few seconds before the home screen can redraw itself. The expandable memory is nice, the screen quality is pretty high in resolution. IR function for tv was a pretty neat but overall useless feature. If i had paid less for this tablet it would be a 5 star but 400 bucks, i regret not just getting the Note tab."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00D029NNA", "review": "Very disappointed. Just bought this item for $379.00. The Galaxy tab 3 leaves much to be desired. Swiping, accessing applications, keyboard typing, accessing the Internet, home button, seem very lagging and slow. The back button has a very large touch area - a lot of times you accidentally hit it and it takes you out of your current app. Very annoying. The side bezel are too thin. When holding the tablet in landscape mode, since the bezels are too thin, your fingers constantly keep touching the surface, and while you are doing something, it just throws you off by switching to another screen. This is also very annoying. The 1280x800 resolution just does not cut it nowadays. Pictures and videos seem fuzzy and not sharp. The speakers sound are just too low and not clean and crisp. Battery is just average. Wifi somehow justs keep scanning even when you are connected, which could drain your battery. Overall, it is an average tablet definitely not worth shelling out almost $400 for it. There are better tablets out there. If the IPad is a Lexus, the Galaxy Tab 3 is probably a Camry at best."}

I must say that for reading it is very good, I find myself really confortable reading books and websites, also creating any document that is really confortable, It is really light and hadn't have any trouble so far in almost a month, but still think is too expensive, I think it would have been better with 8\".\n\nThis version is WiFi only it doesn't support SIM Card (that was for a friend that is confused about it)\n\nConclussion, if you can afford it is more confortable, if you look better price/performance rate go for Galaxy Tab 3 8\""}

It is very easy to use, speed is fast and a the screen is very crisp. I have watched a few shows from Netflix on it and the resolution is great. The sound is stellar since I do not have to use my ear buds like I did when I had the Google Nexus 7.\nI had to take my car for it's annual tune up and while waiting for my vehicle, I was able to read and respond to my email, watched a television show, read a book and apply for jobs using the career builder application. Only down fall with this product is that the volume button is next to the power button and I may hit the wrong button.\nOverall, I am impressed with this tablet, it is worth the price and I know that I will not have to buy another one for a few years."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00D029NNA", "review": "While researching tablets I decided one thing for sure: People complain a LOT. I wanted a tablet that i could use for the usual media consumption, and I wanted to be able to use it to display PDF sheet music on stage. This tablet does that and more.\n\nSPEED: Some people have complained that the tablet is slow. While my laptop is faster, this is not a laptop, but by no means would I call it slow. The speed is adequate for everything I've done with it. I watched the America's Cup races on youtube with it last night.\n\nBATTERY: I've also read that the battery life sucks. This has not been my experience. The battery life is far better than what I see with my laptop.\n\nSCREEN RESOLUTION: The resolution is fine. If you want to lug around an HDMI TV this is not the tablet, but the resolution is very much in the acceptable range.\n\nCAMERA: The camera takes ok pictures, and is more geared towards video chat. Have you seen that one guy taking pictures with a tablet? Yeah, you don't want to be that guy. Go buy a cheap camera. That's not what the tablet is for.\n\nSUMMATION: It's very much worth the money. Good value. Good quality. Good purchase. It is a tablet, not a laptop, and fills an entirely different role than the laptop. I would definitely recommend this as a safe purchase."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00D029NNA", "review": "I've had this for over a month now and really like it. I use it for Hulu and Netflix in my kitchen while doing dishes or cleaning or cooking mostly. I also use it for dropbox which has all my favorite recipes in it. No longer do I have to print anything out to have it handy. It works ok as a E reader but it can't really beat the Kindle paper white for that purpose and I thought I would use it more as an Audiobook reader but I still use my Galaxy S3 phone for that since it works so well and is smaller. I wish they would just put a kickstand on it as I haven't found a cover that I like overall yet and don't think I'll even try any others.\n\nLike some other reviews I'm disappointed in the layout of the menu and back buttons while holding it. It's too easy to swipe them accidentally and I've actually started using it upside down but it's a poor remedy. This is the reason it's not a 5 star rating. I also have the Nexus 7 and Archos 70 (250GB) of those 2, I actually prefer the Archos versatility over the Nexus but neither of them can compare with the Tab 3 for watching videos and using as a paper replacement"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00D029NNA", "review": "I operated a computer company for about 25 years and have grown with the computer industry. This tablet is simply amazing because it is simple, yet complicated, and very reliable. I purchased this unit for three features, it's a Samsung, the microUSB interface and the IR capability. I have a 3 year old Samsung Droid phone and I love it. I am a photographer and wanted the ability to preview images in the field. The microUSB port gives me that capability. If you want to use the microUSB capability, an accessory is required, the Samsung micro USB/USB Connector. I bought mine at Fry's Electronics for $20. One end is micro USB for the tablet and the other is standard USB for things like card readers and flash drives. Caution: I attempted uploading images through the connector using a USB card reader but it failed. Then I tried a USB connection directly with the camera and it worked. I also purchased a more expensive card reader, the Vivitar 50-1, and was able to upload images with that reader. In other words, you may have to try a couple readers to find one compatible with the tablet. I also tried interfacing a notebook hard drive through the USB port but there wasn't enough juice to get the drive spinning. The tablet also has a 64GB storage limit on the removable microSD card.\n\nI am embarrassed to say that I moved to this unit from a Nook. I won't make a comparison because there is no comparison. They are two different worlds. If you buy this Samsung, download the free, companion Kies software from the Samsung Web site. It will enable you to move files back and forth from your desktop or laptop. You can do the same thing using the file browser on your computer. I was really concerned about my contacts in Microsoft Outlook. I have been through the \"moving contacts\" nightmare countless times with different devices. The Kies software found my Outlook .pst file on my desktop hard drive and imported it flawlessly. The format for contacts on the tablet is very nice.\n\nUsing the My Files app built into the tablet, you can view all the folders on the tablet internal drive and external memory card in a tree format. You can move files, copy files, rename files, delete files and make and delete folders. If you are a power user, these features will appeal to you.\n\nIt comes with Polaris, an Android version of Microsoft Office that is compatible, file wise, with Office. I have only used it to view Word attachments that I have received in emails. The printer in my office is set up for sharing on the office network. When I wanted to print an email, the Samsung tablet immediately found the printer and printed the email pronto. Slick.\n\nAudio: Until now, my earbud purchases were for cheapies at any discount store. However I was unhappy with the audio volume on the tablet when playing music videos. I did some earbud research and found some good reviews on a set of Marley buds that have a rocker switch for up and down volume and a mic button in the middle. When you press the mic button, the display changes to a voice input screen, perfect for asking a question. Apparently the buds are designed for the iPad as the volume switch does nothing. No big deal, I adjust volume on the display. The big deal is that I get so MUCH volume from these buds that I can't keep the volume at the highest level without breaking my ear drums. Also the audio quality itself is incredible. Get yourself a set of quality buds. I found these $60 buds on sale at Radio Shack for $25. The tablet has another cool feature, Adapt Sound which is found in the settings menu. When you start Adapt Sound a series of beeps will be transmitted to your buds or earphones so the tablet can perfectly adjust the audio to your hearing. This feature makes a huge difference in the sound.\n\nIt comes with a free 2 year, 50GB subscription to Dropbox, a cloud utility. I am going on vacation next week to the middle of nowhere. I will be able to take images, and upload them to Dropbox using the Hotspot feature on the Samsung phone in conjunction with the tablet.\n\nI watched a youtube.com review of this unit and the guy was unboxing the tablet complaining about the display resolution, although he had not yet looked at the display. This unit has a VERY impressive display. My pictures look AWESOME and I have uploaded some videos for the plane portion of my trip. They look AWESOME too. The unit has a new dual core Intel processor enabling the videos to play flawlessly. I watched another youtube.com video comparing this unit with the iPad 4. The reviewer was talking about how much better the specs are on the iPad, and they are. However there is something called the real world. I am sure the iPad display is somewhat better. However, as a photographer I can tell you that the Samsung display is awesome. This same reviewer also mentioned that the Samsung slowed down. When? When he was playing games and watching movies at the same time. What? Some of the conclusions in online reviews are simply idiotic.\n\nI purchased the white version and the unit itself is pleasing to the eye. I use the voice feature for creating and responding to emails and it works very well. I mentioned the IR, infa red feature. You can control your tv's, Directv set top box, stereo and a whole bunch of other IR home entertainment stuff. The Directv app is awesome as it has a much more comprehensive guide format than that found on your TV.\n\nI have experienced 2 glitches with the unit when starting it up after it had charged all night. The first time it hung up and then corrected itself. The second time I had to reboot. That does not concern me as the unit operates 99.9% of the time perfectly.\n\nIf you're a computer savvy business person or a computer newbie, I think that you will find this unit to be very user friendly and functionally appealing.\n\nI wanted to post more of a hands on review and I hope that you find it helpful. Would I purchase this unit again? Absolutely. I now have my day to day life in this thing and take it everywhere with me. It's a great personal assistant.\n\nUpdate on 9/17/2013: Just got back from a week trip with the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3. Before I left for the trip, I rented 2 movies from my neighborhood movie store and converted them to MP4's using DVD Catalyst. Then I copied them to the 32GB chip I had in the tablet using the USB Connector that I mentioned earlier. I also did the same thing with 2 music DVD's. I had great entertainment on the 2 1/2 hour plane ride coming and going to my destination. I also ordered a 64GB chip but it didn't arrive before I left. A 32GB chip will give you plenty of room. I did discover a problem. Using the built in browser or Chrome, it is impossible to load Flash. I did find a simple solution and that is to purchase the app browser Puffin for $2.99 from the app store that is built into the tablet. It's a full-featured, super great browser and you'll have no issues with Flash. I'm thinking that a future firmware update will correct that issue but it is minor. I used the tablet for downloading images in my camera and it worked great. It downloads them into a folder, Imported Pictures, located in the internal memory of the tablet. I simply moved them to folders I had created in the microSD chip I had inserted into the tablet. While I was on my trip, a friend's wife became so excited about the tablet that we drove 100 miles to purchase one for her."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00D029NNA", "review": "When we first receive this tablet we were very happy and it was an easy 5 star purchase. It was fast, everything seemed to work as expected. After about a week we got a message that a new firmware had been installed and instantly noticed a significant decrease in performance. Apps would crash routinely ... even the factory loaded apps like the web browser. Response is very slow. For example, clicking on this comment field takes a full 8-10 seconds for the keyboard to come up. Sometimes it does not even come up at all. Pressing the home button takes a good 5-8 seconds before anything happens.\n\nI have cleared all of the running processes and we don't have any games or other apps installed or running. CPU power saver is off. EDIT- I belive now that the incredibly low amount of ram (it says 1gb in the specs but the ram manager says 900mb) is to blame. My tablet hovers at around 809mb being used with nothing running but this amazon webpage. That leaves just 91mb free???\n\nAnother problem is the auto brightness. It is poorly calibrated and is useless. It dims the screen way too dark to even see. You will have to set your own brightness but that is not really a big real.\n\nThe accuracy of the touchscreen does not seem as \"smart\" as the Ipad. Sometimes you have to touch it several times before it registers. It is almost like you have to be too accurate. My old Ipad just \"knew\" that if there was only one link in the area- then you were probably trying to touch that link. If there were two links then it would take you to the one you were closer to.\n\nThere are also several other buggy features such as failing to consistently auto capitalize the first letter of a paragraph.  Also pasting can be very frustrating. Sometimes the pasted content ends up at the top of the page instead of where your cursor is located at the time. Scrolling in a window inside of a window is also very frustrating.\n\nThis is now a very frustrating device to use.  Maybe a future firmware update might fix the problem.... we hope."}

I'd give it 5 stars if they had a higher screen resolution. Recommend buying a micro memory card with it. This can eat up memory real quick.\n\nUpdate 6/6/14: Haven't had this a year and already having issues with the touch screen part. It occasionally doesn't work. I have to shut it down, sometimes two or three times to get the touch screen to function properly. Gets to be frustrating at times. I'm a Samsung fan but not happy with this now.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00D029NNA", "review": "As a gen 1 owner of the Apple iPad, I was extremely disillusioned with Apple's discontinued OS support for iPad 1. They effectively turned my three year old (and working fine) iPad into a future brick. Over the past year or so, I've been moving over to Android - most recently with the addition of the fantastic Samsung Galaxy Note 2 phone. I figured it was good timing to make the full switch over to Android and Samsung.\n\nThe Galaxy Tab 3 has all of the features I really like on my phone. It's easy to use, and I love the expandable SD card slot on the device - makes it super easy to extend the device and move files around from my PC to phone to tablet. Since I already had a bunch of Google accounts, all of my information transferred to the tablet easily - just a few set up steps and I was ready to go.\n\nMy biggest complaint is the placement of the power cord, which sits at the bottom of the device in its standard landscape mode. This makes it completely awkward to have the charger in while you're using it - in fact, I have to unplug the power cord (and plug it back in) when I flip open my case (Moko case). It's also awkward when you're sitting with it and trying to charge it at the same time. The Moko case won't stand the device up when the cord is plugged in (I'm not sure what case would, unless it was a docking station).\n\nWhile Samsung has made a lovely device, I sure appreciate the usability experts at Apple. :-)"}

Unfortunately, MANY of the apps I have downloaded have issues that constantly give you the \"(app name) stopped working\" with an option to OK or Report, neither of which seem to do anything to fix the issue. Also you cannot print to a non Samsung printer without shelling out another $13 on an app that will apparently allow for printing of web pages (I'm not willing to throw $13 down the toilet if the app doesn't work as many seem to have issues).\n\nAt this point I am going to try to return this tablet because it is not working as advertised."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00D029NNA", "review": "I just received GT 3 10.1 today. I have been using GT 10.1 for two years (I bought it on June 2011), and I liked the rounded edge and hair-lined back (feels good)  and the bright and colourful screen. That is why I bought GT 3 10.1 again. Meanwhile I had bought Nexus 10 and Xperia Tablet Z but sold them all soon, because Nexus 10 had washed-out colour and Z had yellowish screen (of course, they are not the only reasons).\n\nNow, I knew GT 3 10.1 had the same resolution of screen. All I wanted was just the same screen as that of my 2-year old GT 10.1. But alas, who would have guessed it. The screen totally sucks. First of all, it is yellowish. I guess it is not as yellowish as that of Z, but still. Why the hell a new model's screen is worse than two-year old model? Not only the screen is yellowish, but somehow the text looks blurry. I think it is not because of the resolution, because my GT 10.1 had the same resolution. On GT 3 10.1 text look like text on a CRT monitor. I cannot explain it with words...\n\nAnd haptic (vibration) motor is gone. Vibration was one of the few reasons I chose Samsung tablets because Nexus 7 and Z did not have it. GT 10.1 had haptic motor and why is it gone in GT 3 10.1. I know it is $100 cheap, but COME ON... I did not intentionally buy $100 cheaper model, but because Samsung DID NOT sell high-end 10.1 tablet model. (Galaxy Note 10.1 is too heavy and already 1-year old).\n\nAs I saw on YouTube the two capacitive buttons are way too large. I mean, if the x in the next figure is the actual button location, touching anywhere on the underlined area registers as touch. ____x_____  It may be OK if you use it laying down, but if you hold it one had (and the other is for touching the screen), the middle is where you hold the tablet, and there are overly sensitive touch buttons. This is ridiculous. I think only the actual button position should work not the extra area around the button.\n\nI thought I was going to use it as a remote controller for my fan. But the bundled app only supported TVs and media players. It did not have any custom device mode that allows me to register a button by recording from a remote controller (Z's bundles software allowed it). I searched Play Store but surprisingly, there was any such app. All I found were TV controllers and some stupid apps that did not even support horizontal orientation. I also saw some ridiculously overpriced apps (like $50?) for IR control, but I did not buy it. I think I am going to write my own software for that and upload it to Google Play (I had registered as a developer).\n\nThe edge is not rounded as much as GT 10.1. It is still better than the stupid edged Z, but still, worse than GT 10.1. GT 10.1 feels much better when holding it in hands.\n\nCamera sucks, it does not even have autofocus which GT 10.1 had. That is, it is even down-spec'ed from a two-year old predecessor. Of course flash is also gone. All these for $100? Damn it, Samsung. I would have happily paid $100 more if you made GT 3 10.1 a premium device, not a cheap model like it is.\n\nNow, let's see the bright sides...\n1) Speakers are a bit louder than that of GT 10.1. Louder but not noticeably better.\n2) Physical home button makes it easy to turn on the tablet when it is laying down.\n3) MicroSD card works fine. GT 10.1 did not have MicroSD.\n4) It is not as super fast, but definitely faster than GT 10.1. GT 10.1 is too slow now... This new model also plays 1080p fine. I tried many files and all files played fine. GT 10.1 could only play 720p files (except some 1080p WMV files). I knew that it did not have fast CPU, but I think the performance is OK for general use. So far, so good.\n5) No special charger is needed. Just using the charger for Galaxy Nexus  worked.\n\nI will update for more information after using it for a few more days.\n\n====Update : 24th November, 2013=====\nInitially I was trying to sell it but failed, so I have used it for about 5 months so far. Maybe it is something like a Stockholm syndrome, but I do not hate it now as much as I hated it first.\n\nMy GT 10.1 started show weird strains on the screen, so for the last few months, I did not use it but used GT 3 10.1. I use it almost everyday to watch videos and YouTube. I do have an iPad 3, but it is too heavy and difficult to transfer files to. Maybe my eyes have been adjusted to the screen of GT 3 10.1. Now it does not look as yellowish as it seemed before. It is generally OK, and wow now the price is dropped by $100. At that point, I cannot complain much.\n\nThe points I appreciate about GT 3. 10.1 after using it for 5 months:\n0. It is light. Not lighter than the new iPad Air, but it is still one of the lightest 10.1-inch tablet. I carry it when I go out, and it does not hurt my shoulder noticeably.\n\n1. OK performance. Not super fast and there are some delays when switching between apps, but it performs quite fast and fluid. Maybe not good for demanding 3D games, though.\n\n2. MicroSD card with NTFS support.\n\n3. Build quality. Well I cannot say GT 3 10.1 is perfect, but there are not many alternatives at this price point.\n  - All unbranded Chinese 10-inch tablets : I avoid it, because it gets no software supports from anywhere. They usually have really bad displays, lousy build qualities.\n  - Nexus 10 : Too heavy, with no expansion slot.\n  - iPad : Um, I need an Android tablet.\n  - Kindle fire : Too small. I want 10+.\n  - Tablet Z, Transformer something : pricier than GT 3 10.1, have yellowish screens, etc.\n  - Note 10.1 2014 edition : I tested it and it was sluggish. My GT 3 10.1's screen was brighter than that of Note 10.1 2014 edition (I compared it with my own eyes).\n\nBut here are my complaints about GT 3 10.1 after using it for 5 months:\n0. The back/menu buttons' sensitivity still bothers me. I really wish all three buttons were mechanical buttons OR they were on the right margin of the device with some extra margin to grip on, like B&N's Nook HD+.\n\n1. Notification menu seems stupid. It does not utilise the large screen. GT 3 10.1 has wide width, but narrow height, so if I were the engineers, I would have made the items into two columns. The items appear too wide, and since it has narrow height, I often have to scroll down to see other items.\n\n2. Lack of a notification LED. I really wonder why they did not put this? My GS 3 has it, and it is very helpful to see if it is charging, any new messages. How much does it cost anyway to put a small LED lamp?\n\n3. The back is too slippery.  GT 10.1 has hairlines and not slippery at all. How much does it cost to put hairlines on the back, seriously?\n\n4. Google Now. Since its home button is a physical button I cannot use swipe it up to start Google Now. I wish I could map home button double click to Google Now, but I cannot. Frankly speaking, Samsung S-voice sucks."}

I must say that I love it.  There isn't that much new about it except that it is lighter, faster, and the screen is fantasticly clear.  It is a bit more expensive than I would like, but it is improved in many ways and it is a good buy for those who love the Samsung tabs like I do.  I don't care for Apple products, I love android and Google.  I am very happy with my new tablet!"}

I can deal with that. But here's the surprise , I couldn't put my sd card in it because it couldn't stick that means its not gonna read it at and that was the first and last thing I checked because it was the most important thing for me ( by the way it's the first time I leave a review on a product, ever) so good luck guys ."}
