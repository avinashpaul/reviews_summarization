I had been pounding away on my TF101, holding out patiently & impatiently, until I could actually grasp the TF700T. Just ordered mine about 32 hours ago and selected one day shipping. I will say it lives up to the hype! Display of course it out of this universe. Extremely fast, even for ICS. I hear that Jelly Bean will be making its way to Asus in the next week or so, which should smooth out all transitions and swipes. Overall I am very impressed, and after a few minor updates (as usual) this tablet will officially be the beast of the block!\n(FYI: for any tablet ever, there is no need to get 3G/4G service plan. Why? Cost too much, wifi is everywhere, tether, wifi access fees (if needed) will be cheap than a monthly bill,"}

Im not gonna get into too much detail, Im sure if you are thinking about getting this tablet you already read all the good reviews on the tech sites so if you are still undecided on wether to get it or not let me just tell you this: YOU WILL LOVE IT!!! It's a beautiful piece of technology. I just got mine yesterday (July 18th)from Office Depot, and from the moment I saw it I fell in love with it, my wife loves it too so we are getting a second one for her.\nJust stop reading and buy it, you won't regret it ;)\n\nEDIT:\nI TOTALLY REGRET getting this piece of crap for $500 when it was released, on paper this tablet was the dream tablet we all had been waiting for back in 2012, during the first days of use it was a work horse but as soon as I loaded some apps onto it the nightmare began, updating apps made me wanna kill myself, it would take hours to update a few apps so I stopped updating them altogether, wifi drains the battery like crazy, Asus did nothing to fix the issues. That was the first and last time I looked at a product from Asus. Now I have a $500 (which was the amount I paid) paper weight, which I occasionally grab to check Facebook. STAY AWAY!!! You have been warned."}

The first failure was 10 days out of the initial warranty, they said to send back at my expense, they would honor it.$18 to UPS, and they sent a bill for $205, to repair.

My company purchased about 20 of these a couple years ago much to the chagrin of 90% of the sales staff.  Our IT manager has a serious and unfounded hatred of all things Apple (You are paying for the name)  and made a huge and very costly mistake not listening to input from the vast majority of folks that were going to use them.  The owner went all out and purchased the TF700 Transformer and Keyboard sparing no expensive so everyone was extremely excited and thankful for his gracious generosity and prepared to make the most of this new \"tool\" especially in front of clients.  Well that was the beginning of Asus Hell for the vast majority of recipients of this product. These have proven to be excruciatingly slow, buggy, and simply unreliable.  Mine has been back to IT 4 or 5 times and most sale people have simply surrendered and use their personal pad while in the field.  As of last week mine will not even turn on and I've been to every forum I can find and tried all the known tricks of the trade to no avail.  I've also noticed a tremendous amount of frustration exhibited by other Asus pad owners as well. I still appreciate our owners generosity as this was a tremendous spend for a small business products distribution company (100 or so workers)  and just wish he would have chosen another brand.  By the way I am not an Asus hater as I have used 2 of their high end routers for 2 or 3 years and they are beasts and work flawlessly..."}

Specifically I wanted the quad core Tegra 3 and the 1920x1200 IPS screen.\n\nHere is what I got - a tablet that doesn't work. 4 years later this tablet has never worked. Asus abandoned it shortly after releasing it, stopped updating it, because they knew the design was flawed.\n\nThe main issue with these is slowness. They will stop responding for 2-3 minutes at a time and when they do work, they are slow. Very, very slow. Painfully slow. 486dx66 slow. Unusably slow. You cannot predict the slowness either. Sometimes simply opening the settings menu might cause the tablet to go into a mini-coma for 3-4 minutes.\n\nI have tried all kinds of custom firmware, official firmware, google stock firmware, nothing works. Asus support is worthless.\n\nCyanogen 11 works the best, but it's not great. The version of android this shipped with did not support TRIM, which is a major issue. This thing needs to have TRIM run DAILY for ANY kind of usability. The best thing to do is set the CPU to performance, set the minimum CPU to 600+ MHz, set background process limit to MAX 4, and you will have SOME KIND of experience - it will be a BAD EXPERIENCE, but you will at least be able to read an email.\n\nLong story short - Asus screwed a lot of people with these devices. I'll never buy another Asus product. This design is JUNK. Avoid. They are cheap now - that's for a reason. AVOID."}

I don't know how some of the people would praise this deadbeat unit, what I have experienced after I got it only made me speechless. I have another first generation EEE Transformer T100, but it seems that except the resolution is not as sharp as this TF700T, all the other functions are way better and faster than TF700T. When used T100 to read some ebooks, there's no lag, slow down or freeze up ever, yet this darn TF700T, even the simple text page of the ebook would be a heavy work for it, it would freeze up after just a few pages. It only showed that the meager 1GB memory on this unit is not enough even to handle several pages turning over of any ebook. The finished page would suddenly freeze up, a circular mark would appear in the middle of the page, it'd circle and circle and circle for so long and then, the whole screen would turn black, all the touching function on the screen would disappear, the only way to make it work again is to shut down and restart it again.\n\nI think the TF700T got very serious problems all over it. When I tried to use the browser(s), the browser(s) would suddenly notify you the \"XXXbroswer has stopped working, would you like to Wait or....\" WTF?! Even using browser to surf the web would be a mission impossible?\n\nYes, TF700T is lighter than T100; yes, the pad feels lighter with more comfortable edges around to hold onto; yes, the resolution is sharper than the old model....But Asus, what else this TF700T is better than your orginal first generation T100? The keyboard still got the same problem when you try to type something, it jumps around like crazy blind mad guy, if you don't pay attention all the time during your typing, you would find what you have typed already messed up with what you've already typed, making the whole text become a unreadable garbled mess. In order to make TF700T lighter, Asus cut so many corners to get that result, yet at the same time, sacrificed all the important parts and functions to make it a better and newer device."}

I power the device on and it takes a couple minutes (literally) to see the login screen. Most of the time the screen dims and the device goes to sleep within 5 seconds of the login screen appearing. Sometimes I am ready to start typing my password immediately; other times I have to push the power button again to revive the login screen (cue another short delay). I start typing my password, and... sluggish response. Is this thing registering my keystrokes? Oops, it thinks I typed the same character twice. Backspace... (wait...) ok, try again. Poking each key deliberately and slowly this time so I don't \"overwhelm\" the machine with input. You get the idea.\nThis sort of performance continues with apps, particularly Google apps (?!). Reducing the number of apps I had installed helped somewhat. I think I have about 34 apps installed, including the ones that came pre-installed and can't be uninstalled. Google Chrome comes pre-installed. Using it is like browsing the internet at 2400 baud (that's late 1980's tech level). Observing the device using the \"System Monitor Lite\" app showed the CPUs running at 465 MHz 38% of the time, and 1.5 GHz 42% of the time. Why is the My Library app using up 15% of my CPU? I haven't added any new documents. There aren't any updates. I didn't launch it. Why is it running?\n\nWhen I use this device, I would say 75% of the time I give up in frustration. Is it Asus? Is it Android? My sense is that it's Android, but it could be the poorly written bloatware Asus installed and forces me to keep.\n\nMy advice would be: Look into the Apple iPad."}

For example, when I'm watching a movie, I like to be able to pause it, then jump online to look up something about the movie. Unfortunately, most of the time, when I do that, web pages take forever to load, or just hang up completely. Gets so frustrating, I just want to hurl it across the room.\n\nAlso has a really hard time with a lot of games, especially if they are graphics-intensive. Some newer games (Kill Shot Bravo, for example) won't run at all on this tablet. And, it won't update past Jellybean, so there's that.\n\nThere's a software glitch common to these tablets that causes a thin black line to flash on the screen occasionally. It's annoying, but fortunately does not do anything more serious than that.\n\nPhysically, it's a pretty rugged little machine. I dropped mine onto a tile floor from about 2.5 feet and it landed on one corner. Bent it a little, but (knock wood) caused no problems.\n\nAll in all, a good portable machine for movies and reading, or for light tasks (I use it to run Outlook, OneNote, etc).

It was a frustrating reminder of why it ended up there, and just how disappointing this tablet has constantly been.\n\nEven while I'm writing this, I'm wondering why I would bother to write a review for a product that's almost 4 years old, and that almost no one could possibly be even considering buying at this point. But I guess that is a testament to just how thoroughly, crushingly, and repeatedly disappointed I have been with it, while even so wanting to like it for that entire time...\n\nLet me start off by saying that this is one of the most elegant hardware implementations (NOTE: the _visible_ part of the HW) that I've ever owned. This is a beautiful tablet, with what is still one of the most gorgeous screens I've ever seen. I've owned both the tablet and the keyboard dock for 3+ years, and it still looks and feels like it did out of the box - solid, weighty without being heavy or clunky, an absolutely perfect external package.\n\nUnfortunately, that's where the beauty ends. I don't know what ASUS did wrong here - I've researched it up & down, I've tried every trick & suggested fix, I've even rooted it and replaced the ASUS stock Android with a custom ROM. The sad, unfortunate fact is, something in the guts of this thing is just wrong. Don't get me wrong, the tablet works - always has, since the day I got it. But it stutters, halts, takes forever to \"catch up\". The custom ROM took care of most of the random crashes that the ASUS firmware experienced (often), but nothing got rid of the sheer, unadulterated clunky-ness that was this tablet's user experience.\n\nSo sad, really - ASUS really had a potential home run here. I still have yet to see an Android hardware implementation that even comes close to being as elegant as this. But they had something wrong deep down in the tablet, and they released it anyway. And that's too bad, in that it's really soured me not just on this particular tablet model but on ASUS as a manufacturer & brand. It gives me pause, to think that they knew something was \"off\" here (and they had to have known, there've been way more than enough issues & reports about this thing since soon after its initial release) and the company still said \"ship it\". That's just not right, and it makes it doubtful that I'd ever trust them again.\n\nIn summary, to anyone out there that might still be thinking that this is a deal now that it's a fraction of the original price - it's not. Save yourself a lot of time & headaches. Spend the $150 or $200 or whatever this costs now, and get anything else. It won't feel as good in your hands, and it won't look as good to your eyes, but I guarantee you won't get worn down and ultimately completely disappointment either..."}

It has never been right. The battery life sucks. For a quad core processor...I only get one core running at a time. This tablet won't maintain the minimum core speed settings and keeps reverting to 204MHz. Who cares about the screen quality because there's no way this slow thing would ever let me watch a movie. Save your money and buy something else."}

Apps crash all the time, including Launcher and other system apps. No app is immune, and the same apps don't crash on my other Android device, so it's not the apps. Despite having plenty of free memory (not in use by either apps or system), many of the crashes are due to out-of-memory errors.\n\nIt's also incredibly slow. Open a folder, and it might take 5-10s to open, if it opens at all. When it gets that way, every action is the same. Tap and pray that the tablet eventually does something."}

As others have detailed, it continually crashes (I've tried every browser out there and from day one never got them to work well). For awhile, it would work for email and making notes in Evernote but the screen display and speed slowed down so much that it was quicker and easier to make notes on paper and type them into a functioning device later. It's such a shame because it has nice screen resolution, decent battery life and a good size keyboard and is wonderfully portable. I've searched for solutions with no luck though I've turned up tons of negative reviews. It's a paperweight now!"}

But slowly and surely, it became the last thing I would use to read, surf or play with apps on. I tried all sorts of tricks to try and get it to work more quickly just shy of doing anything that would void the warranty. Even with only junk apps it came with, this thing was molasses in January.\n\nSo now I'm biding my time to swallow the $600+ mistake (yep, I went all in and bought the damn keyboard too!) and buy something new.\n\nAnd the taste in my mouth is still so bad that as I'm looking for a new laptop, I won't even look at Asus.  It's really that bad.\n\nSo why the two stars instead of one?

I don't have a tablet to compare it to since I've never used any other but my Motorola 1st gen Droid was faster and more reliable than this. Don't waste more than 20 bucks on this.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "Are you looking for a tablet with the freedom of Android, and all the functionality of the iPad? If so, the Asus Transformer Infinity is the right tablet for you.\n\nFreedom\n\nThis tablet uses the Android operating system which gives you the freedom to customize your user experience, including what apps are used by default, your onscreen keyboard, and your app launcher.\n\nThe iPads iOS doesnt allow very many customizations. They lock you to using Apples apps by default, the default keyboard, and the default launcher.\n\nWinner: Asus Transformer Infinity\n\nPrice\n\nThe Asus Transformer Infinity is priced at either $239.99(32gb) or $399.99(64gb). When compared to other tablets of similar capabilities, such as the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 ($259.99 for 16gb), this is a great deal. Meanwhile, the iPad is priced significantly higher at $449.99 (32gb) or $599.99 (64gb) even though it has less impressive specifications.\n\nWinner: Asus Transformer Infinity\n\nSpecifications\n\nThe Asus Transformer Infinity has either 32gb or 64gb of flash memory built in. This can be expanded by an extra 128gb through the use of the built in MicroSD card slot or USB port. There is also a built in HDMI port that allows you to connect to HDMI TVs or other displays to easily share your screen. The available Asus keyboard has a built in battery that will keep the tablet going for much longer than the rated 9.5 hours. This extra boost in battery puts it ahead of all other tablets within its price range.\n\nTo this day, the iPad does not support the use of SD cards, USB, or external displays without the purchase of a clunky adapter. Also, there are no Apple accessories to extend the iPads otherwise average battery life.\n\nWinner: Asus Transformer Infinity\n\nApps\n\nMany people think that Android is lacking high quality apps compared to iOS. This belief couldn't be further from the truth. When I first bought Android, I was able to find nearly all of the exact same apps on the Google Play Store. As for those that I couldn't find, such as iBooks and Facetime, there were very good equivalents in Google Books and Google Hangouts.\n\nWinner: Tie\n\nSummary\n\nOverall, you can be confident that the Asus Transformer Infinity will perform just as good as, if not better than the iPad in nearly every aspect. I definitely recommend it to anyone who is hesitant on making the switch from the iPad to Android. Hopefully I have helped you make your decision. Ill see you on Hangouts!"}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "If you are looking for a high quality tablet I strongly recommend you consider a brand other than ASUS.  My tablet quit charging after 14 months and nothing I could do could fix it.  After returning it to ASUS I was informed that the motherboard was bad and that the charge to fix it would be $236 including parts, labor and shipping.  ASUS refused to give any consideration to the fact that it was only 14 months old and barely out of warranty.  A bad battery or plug might be reasonable, but not a bad motherboard.  It was a take it or leave it response from ASUS.  Since the same model can be purchased from Amazon for less than the repair charge it made no sense to get it repaired and only have a 90 day repair warranty.  My new tablet is a Samsung!\n\nOn the brighter side, because it was purchased new and fully paid for with a VISA card, VISA extended the warranty an additional year and reimbursed the repair amount after I provided them the necessary documentation.  This is a nice service that VISA provides.  I would recommend that your electronic purchase be registered with your card company when purchased to make the process go more quickly."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "Pros: The finish is nice, and it has a smooth, thin feel to it.\nCons: The battery life is really poor. I have even reset to defaults and installed minimal apps, disabled GPS, etc., and it still doesn't last as long as many of my other devices. If you leave this tablet running with the screen locked, it will not last a day. The charger is proprietary! It uses about 15V to charge, so it will not charge from USB, or standard cell phone or tablet chargers. Another issue I have with it is that the screen is not very responsive to touch. You have to tap things multiple times to get them to react.\n\nI use this just in my living room, using Chromecast to watch shows and movies on the TV. I always have to shut it down when finished, or else the battery will be dead the next day. I keep going back to my old Motorola Xoom. Aside from its nice looks and finish, this is the worst tablet I have ever had. Time for a yard sale!"}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I was originally very excited about this tablet and had purchased it to use instead of a laptop while travelling. At home, the tablet mostly served as a media viewing device for watching movies and TV shows from files or via streaming services.\n\nThe keyboard dock was great as it also served as an additional battery supply, however, it was poorly engineered, and I wonder if it had been tested prior to release. If the keyboard was open more than 90 degrees on a flat surface, the tablet would fall on it's back if you lifted your hands from the keys due to the heavier weight of the tablet compared to the keyboard dock. A simple weight added to the keyboard dock would have fixed this issue.\n\nThe tablet performed very slowly over wireless networks. Although it did not have an issue with bandwidth, and could stream HD video over wifi very well, latency was an issue, particularly with very long connection times when trying to load webpages etc. I had read that this was an issue on Amazon reviews before purchasing but didn't think it would be too much of an issue, but it proved to be very frustrating. We have a number of other tablets, phones and laptops in the house and this tablet by far performed the worst over a wireless network.\n\nThe external micro HDMI port was a great addition, and I have been unable to find this on other tablets that I'm interested in purchasing as a replacement. This was extremely useful when travelling and you wanted to stream or play video from your tablet to a TV screen.\n\nThe main reason I have voted this 1 star and would advise people to steer clear of it is the overall reliability of the tablet. As a lot of other reviews have stated, this tablet suffers from a lot of random reboots and failures. Just after my one-year warranty expired the tablet completely failed and will not boot at all. Asus help center were not able to help and only suggested shipping the tablet off to an Asus service center at my cost. The cost of repair including labour and shipping is estimated to be more than purchasing a new tablet. Unfortunately since I purchased on Amazon, I am unable to have the tablet repaired or replaced under obligations by the retailer to comply with local consumer law in my country.\n\nPros:\nKeyboard dock with extra battery\nExternal micro HDMI port\nGood picture quality and screen\n\nCons:\nPoor wireless networking performance\nConstant shut downs and failures\nDied just after one-year warranty expired\n\nIn comparison, my partner's Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 out-performs this tablet in almost every way, with the exception of the keyboard and external micro HDMI port. If someone could make a tablet with the performance and reliability of a Samsung, but with the keyboard dock and HDMI port, that would be nice."}

I contacted Asus technical support (after all, a defective product is no fault of the seller), and they promptly arranged an RMA# and delivered a new unit to me.\n\nOut of the box, it's operation is somewhat \"laggy\". It's easily fixed if you go through the settings and disable some of the pre-loaded apps you know you won't be using. Things such as \"Google Korean Input\", a multitude of ASUS apps, etc. Shutting down these unnecessary background applications can significantly improve the performance of the tablet.\n\nThe screen resolution is great but the sound quality is so-so given that it has only one speaker on the right side (when oriented in landscape).\n\nAs it stands now, I'm pleased with it. I use this mainly for internet browsing and e-books, And while it plays many games fine, some processor-heavy games will result in lag and screen stuttering. Rooting the device and loading a custom ROM would make a world of difference, but is also beyond the scope of this review and the skills of the average user."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "Totally agree with EastSide's review on July 20, 2012. I too fell for the specs on paper and soon found out that I was duped .  This thing is such a lemon that my 8-year-old doesn't want to use it because it is too slow.  I too hoped for an update, but ASUS did not choose to do so.  Therefore, they can count me out on any future product purchases.  What a waste of my families money.  I rarely feel ashamed of a purchase as I research, and I too saw that there were many promising reviews.  I have included EastSide's review below.\n\"I just deleted my original 5-star, glowing review (I was one of the first early adopters who bought the TF700T when it first came out last Summer).. I was eagerly waiting almost a year for a full-HD tablet and on paper everything looks good and should be good. This was my first tablet and of course I didn't know better so everything seemed nice and \"fast\" at the beginning, just like the 70% of people giving 5-star reviews here right after purchasing this tablet. Well, what an expensive mistake it turned out to be!\n\nAfter 8 months of daily use and having tried other TF700Ts (all with similar issues) and comparing it to other newer hi-res tablets, I'm *gladly* getting rid of it. Despite the quad-processor and all the nice on-paper-only-specs, what kills it is the slow NAND RAM memory (not the storage memory) and the ASUS GUI overlay on top of Jelly Bean. To make things worse and adding insult to injury, the RAM is limited to 1GB(!).. it's like having a PC with very slow non-upgradeable 512MB RAM after system overhead. It makes using the tablet feel \"bloated\", lagging and excruciatingly slow. Of course people who just bought it (including me then) are blinded by the shinny full-HD screen (pun intended) and excited by the on-paper-only potential but that wears off pretty soon once you put the tablet to heavy use and realize how other tablets handle the same load. Don't take me wrong, the tablet works relatively well doing passive stuff (like reading) and the screen is bright and nice but that's it. The first months I was hoping for a miraculous firmware update, many came but nothing really changed. This thing stutters while browsing or just using apps. Typing gets extremely annoying if you are used to fast computers, smartphones or newer tablets. It takes time for the tablet to catch up with you and sometimes freezes up or blanks out. No, not even cold re-booting or updating to the latest firmware will fix this (I just updated to ASUS's latest modified version of Android 4.2.1) and it's still slow and buggy. Yes, you could root the 700T (cleanrom, data2SD) but that misses the point. I should not be the one half-fixing a mediocre engineered tablet and on top of that losing my warranty doing it. Besides SD cards have limited read/write cycles.\""}

Come back to it a day or two later and the battery is completely drained.\n\nI use iPads at work and we can leave them on standby for days and days and come back with minimal change in battery (and that is not turning it on airplane mode), my Android phone if I charge it all night use 10% of the battery and let it sit for a day without touching it (and without turning on Airplane mode) my battery will be closer to full than empty, so I don't buy system limitations. Then the tablet runs like crap for 10 minutes after I take it off airplane mode. So I am left with a tablet I use rarely because I have to plan usage of for hours in advance since I will need to charge it before each use. Pass on this look elsewhere. Also it uses some odd charger even though most devices (especially android) have moved to micro usb, meaning I can't even charge this with my variety of chargers but must drag the single one I have for this with me."}

The \"ghost clicks\". After reading a lot on the web we bough a new digitizer screen and replaced it - no change at all. Finally, we realized that the loose contact of the digitizer ribbon cable was the cause of the screen malfunction. The most useful advise on \"iFixIt\" web site suggested to slip a piece of film into the same slot as digitizer cable to firm up the contact. It helped, but only temporarily. For the last half a year cracking the case open and reinserting these digitizer cables has become our biweekly exercise. Unfortunately, buying a cheaper tablet with less memory is not a good choice - these devices really do need these 64 Megs, otherwise mapping software and videos are sluggish or not at all functional. Shelling out more than $500 every year and a half is outside of reason for us. It would not have been so bad if parts were readily available, but that is not the case, parts are exceedingly hard to buy. The bottom line: it's a great tablet while that contact lasts. But  the luck ran out in 1.5 year."}

First off, Asus is a brand ive known and trusted for years, motherboards to monitors, they produce quality merchandise at a decent price. Right from the unpacking, you see a box ( rather attractive one ) that just says your holding something good. Opening the marketing packaging by pulling cover straight up ... exposing your brand new asus tablet. Tablet is wrapped in protective wrap, comes with USB cord/charger.\n\n  Now the important stuff :). Let me say that ive gotten a LOT of complements on the sheer looks this tablet has, the performance is actually pretty dang good ... the processor held true to what was advertised, same with ram.  I did buy and install a SanDisk Extreme 64 Gb Micro SDXC 60mb/s card, mounted immediately with no troubles!! The last tablet had a very weak wifi antenna installed, lost signal on all of 2nd floor of my home. ... Asus tablet not only has connection upstairs, but has 3 out of 4 bars all way in backbedroom, farthest from router ..... obviosly a betterwifi antenna then previous tablet.\n\n Sound ok, its a tablet, you cant expect symphony hall ... though i should say im really not lovin the volume buttons, its easy to slide fingers over n miss buttons once or twice before you realize where they are, imho they should be raised a couple mm so they more pronounced n easier ti find. Video, yeahhhhh this tablet has a really a good hd screen to it, ive gone n watched several hd videos .... rather impressive ... im sure thats got alot to do with nvidias most powerfullest video graphics card to date on ANY MOBILE PLATFORM!!! Laptop, smartphones, an tablets, this tablet has it. Youtube vids on this, theres one from the developers.\n\n If your thinking about this tablet, just get it. If your comparing this tablet to others here, i already did that for weeks ... this IS what your looking for"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "ok... this review is admittedly based upon limited experience. I purchased this tablet as a Christmas present for my wife. She has been using a two year old Acer Iconia A100 7 inch tablet. This is the second Asus tablet I've gotten. The first one failed within a couple of days - touch screen didn't respond and you couldn't get into the tablet from the lock screen. I sent it back through Amazon and received the replacement promptly. The replacement has performed flawlessly. I've set it up so that it will be ready for my wife to use on Christmas morning. The wifi works perfectly and the battery life is amazing... on standby the battery has barely budged after over a week. I do have it set to only have wifi turned on when the tablet is off and connected to the charger. This makes a huge difference in battery life... likewise I keep bluetooth turned off as my wife doesn't use any bluetooth devices.... also makes a big difference in battery life.  So far I'm very happy with this tablet and I expect my wife to be very happy with the 7 inch to 10.1 inch upgrade..... the price can't be beat... this tab was $100 less than what I paid for the 7 inch Iconia a couple of years ago. I might also add that I also got a couple of Asus Memo Smart Tab Me 170cx tablets for my grandkids this year and they are very happy with them. Asus is a good brand and the products are quality.!"}

I sent it in for warranty and they sent me an invoice for $272 when the new tab is $210. There's a reason Asus has suffered and failed to match other top brands.\n\n**Update**\nI would also like to point out that the Asus Warranty service absolutely sucks. It is plagued with multiple levels of incompetencies.\ni) Customer Services Rep (Rep) refused to honor the purchase from Amazon reseller as an authorized Asus reseller\nii) Arguing which, he refused to accept that LCD is actually covered in the warranty (God know's then what is? the volume button?)\niii) finally admits LCD is covered but surprise surprise my tablet was delivered with damage, a broken LCD, so broken LCD is not covered of course. Tells me to file a claim with UPS for damaging it in delivery. I told him I had insurance and UPS checked the item before packing it so, send me pictures and I'll be happy to file a claim and get them on board with this (total bluff about having insurance though)\niv) invoices me for $272 when new tab is $190 for fixing the \"broken\" LCD\nv) I file a dispute, 2 days later I get an email saying that the agent mistakenly read/saw broken LCD when in fact LCD is not broken, but there's damage on the side.\nBy side damage he meant the frame and the LCD has a gap which can maybe fit a paperclip, and that's how the LCD came to me I just never bothered to ship it back and get it replaced because it was so cosmetic, had no impact on functionality, and was under a cover. Also if I don't pay $100 to fix the frame they can't fix the LCD. Here's the link to the \"broken\" side that stops them from fixing a crashed LCD: [...]\n\nThe bottom line is, these people are selling extremely low quality products and trying to cut corners with warranty issues.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "Asus TF700T is a relatively dated model (released in 2012).\n\nIts build quality is solid and on par with that of iPads.\n\nBattery life is descent and the CPU performance is little bit lagging (because it was released 2 years ago).\n\nThe display resolution is true HD (1920x1080) and IPS monitor quality is outstanding (even not as high as that of iPad retina screens, which have even higher resolution).\n\nIt runs Android 4.2.2.\n\nThe only glitch I had was that, due to the fact it was released and probably made in 2012, I need download and apply a lot of updates from google store. For some reason, some google app updates always failed to update and caused the installation process of google store to hang. The symptom is that, you won't be able to install any new app and won't be able shut down or restart the tablet.\n\nI had to restore the tablet to the factory condition to start over again. This was quite frustrating for non-tech savy customers. I tried several times and downloaded the app updates in various different orders. Eventually, I was able to complete the update and bring the whole system up-to-date.\n\nSince then, no issue happened and it runs very reliably.\n\nMy family owns iPad mini 2 and iPad air. I prefer to experience some non-apple technology just to keep my eyes open.\n\nWere it not for the fact that Google store installation process had glitches, I would have given this product 5 star-reivew."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "Fool me once, shame on Asus.\n\nOther than its relatively slow eMMC internal storage specification, the TF700 boasted a pretty spectacular set of specs on paper and was lauded as a groundbreaking design when introduced in mid-2012.  It's a tablet I have used for hours a day since buying late that year.  However, as numerous others have described in support forums and customer reviews:  with ongoing use it has become chronically laggy and slow (far slower than dial-up speed slow); yet under warranty terms, users may not unlock it to install required fixes.\n\nWhen it takes 19 minutes to navigate four web pages and send an email link from each - an operation that should take 60 seconds in a skilled operator's hands - game is over.\n\nWorse:  Asus stopped issuing needed software updates just one year after release, so buyers are still stuck on Jellybean 4.2.1 as of Dec 2014.  That's disappointing (and probably a little outrageous) for a tablet priced far higher than its competitors and hyped as a premium model at time of sale.\n\nIronically:  had Asus pushed a Kitkat update (instead of stagnate this model at v4.2.1), it probably would have gone a long way to correct many of the storage inefficiencies that drag this model into the toilet.  Quite a few individual owners have jailbroken their TF700s to force a Kitkat upgrade - and found their nearly-dead TF700s gain remarkable new life.\n\nThat manual upgrade, along with a few efficiency utilities, help overcome one of the prominent reasons for TF700's poor performance:  its use of eMMC storage.  (The HowToGeek site provides a smart explanation for how that becomes a performance bottleneck in \"eMMC vs. SSD: Not All Solid-State Storage is Equal\":  eMMC storage works well for data storage but provides slower access than SSD, so it's better suited for long-term storage than it is for, say, fast reads/writes required by an operating system.)\n\nAnother major TF700 performance drag:  bloatware.  I never grasped how significant that can be, till I owned a TF700.  I always thought bloatware meant:  a few extra unwanted apps that the consumer could ignore or uninstall.  But independent developers have identified TF700 bloatware modules which persistently communicate its device status back to Asus (current software version, GPS location, more).  When still supported by publisher, such utilities made some sense (after all, TF700 received a few pushed upgrades during its initial months) but once the publisher abandoned the model, these legacy apps, still aggressively chewing up resources, act more like an anchor.  After unlocking and learning how to use ADB (Android Data Bridge), I removed the associated CMClient, DMClient and Parental Lock - and experienced a remarkable performance gain as a result, in just one of my own experiments with the model.\n\nSo the solution is:  buy a replacement (better) tablet, or rescue this expensive model by repairing or replacing its software.  I prefer a repair, rather than tossing away this expensive model.\n\nBut applying a replacement custom ROM is skilled IT work requiring a self-study project to safely deploy - and as I learned, the vastly greater operating speed may also come with issues not fully debugged for bluetooth or DRM support:  I temporarily lost bluetooth remote speaker stereo pairing (since fixed) and permanently lost Tivo streaming because the Tivo publisher blocks that app if the tablet has been repaired by consumer (a publisher choice that robs consumers of fair use of an app for which they paid for supportive streaming hardware - poor choice by Tivo, and one that has rankled many owners).\n\nBetrayed - tired of fighting it - and apparently resigned to having to buy a replacement tablet (since even good custom ROMs built by enthusiasts and freely offered, have their bugs that in my own case broke apps I use all the time):  sure, yeah, I concluded:  I'll buy another tablet.  But:  it won't be an Asus tablet.  Not after this experience.\n\nIronically, I still have an Asus desktop tower PC and Win 8 laptop, which continue to be well used and I really like - but they're not locked formats, so they will likely have a longer useful life.  I'll simply advise friends:  how can you trust that the next Asus tablet won't be similarly abandoned by its publisher support within just a year?\n\n-\nP.S. - Since publishing the above, I've gained some industry and market perspective - and found a custom ROM by one of the open source developers that reshaped my TF700 into a (nearly) new tablet, with stable, fast, highly functional performance.\n\nPerspective.  Asus is hardly alone in marketing tablets with short lifecycles and premature planned obsolescence. Product research suggests the tablet category is premised on short useful lives, presumably to goad consumers into replacing their gear with the next model.\n\nTablet manufacturers should take a lesson from the music industry, which had to reprice and repackage its products when consumers recognized its price gouging for what it was - and simply stopped buying albums, en masse.\n\nWe may already be seeing such a reaction with tablet sales; the latest market projections declare a surprise downward trend, and actually attribute the drop to consumers seeking to extend useful lives of their expensive models.  Can't blame consumers - conditioned to buying cheap, powerful desktop PCs:  they compare value, and feel ripped off if a premium priced tablet has a useful life only 1/3 as long as a comparatively cheaper desktop PC, or comparably priced laptop.\n\nMy own moment of zen:  thanks to excellent work by some of the android custom ROM developers who publish in forums (though I may not link here, you'll find them):  I'm happily using a zippy fast \"Vanir\" Kitkat v. 4.4.4 custom ROM now on my TF700, and the sole shortcoming is that Tivo app whose publisher won't let it stream to a rooted tablet (but for now, I'll live with that single fail).  We're all learning, as we go.\n\nLooks like I won't be buying a new tablet soon, after all.  But when I do, I'll seek out a Google Nexus: perhaps unique in the category, they tend to receive publisher upgrades well past their first year.\n\n____\n\nMarch 2015 update:  I found a great successor tablet.\nNow reviewed at product page for:  Dell Venue 8 7000."}

I looked for an eQ app but with the new jellybean firmware update they cracked down on the audio files. 2 camera, the camera quality is great you also get flash, but lots of bug problems, for example I took a couple of pictures and soon after the hole screen turned white, it's worse with macro shot. 3 the GPU Is horrible for a gaming company I'm baffled and shocked to see this it has some difficulty play 2D games let alone 3D. Love the power save modes and they really work. 4 WiFi speed, the WiFi speed dose not match up with that of your Internet, it feels like it's on 54k dile up. 5 touch screen the touch screen response is horrible as well it feels like your fishing for the right spot on the screen to navigate through Internet games Netflix music apps and Manny others. 6 there is no HD sound using head photos. The sound out put is only 441k, HD audio is 48k or above. The HD screen is ideal not great for a 400+ dollar device. Love the looks of the table hand function, dose not come with much blot wear, in all if it's only for 188 dollars it's worth it to buy."}

I thought it was the 1GB of ram doing this but after spending time with a TF300T I notice that does not happen.\nSometimes when you open one app it choses another and the Wi-Fi cuts off when streaming movies for no reason and thats after I switched the settings that cuts off the Wi-Fi when the screen is off to save battery.\nIts a shame cause its a beautiful tablet even if its a 2012 model."}

I don't know about you but I expect a $450 tablet to last longer than 15 months.  Why do I mention the +2 days? Simply put, Asus extends the 12 month warranty by 90 days and I was 2 days outside that range.  They don't care that it might take 2 weeks or 2 months to get the table after it's ordered, they don't care; they use the order date and not the delivery date.\nResearch on ASUS support reflects that many tablet owners never see their tablet again so I decided not to spend good money after bad and ship it in to ASUS only to have it lost by them. I figure I've already wasted more than enough time with that group. The only time I'll spend with ASUS now is to let everyone know what kind of shoddy hardware they make.

In certain light it can sometimes look like this odd bluish-gray color, but really it's purple. I knew this going in but I decided on \"odd blue-purple-gray\" over \"ugly beige-gold-champagne.\" (Personally I call that second color \"baby poop.\" If you've ever changed a diaper you understand why.) 2) For no apparent reason it will randomly reboot every now and then, even if I'm not even touching it. A sometimes-inconvenient oddity, but nothing major.\n\nDon't let those two little weirdnesses turn you away, though. This is a great tablet. When it comes to phones, I'm pro-vanilla Android; but on tablets, I like a slightly more powerful interface that offers more functions with fewer touches/less navigation. Asus provides that here exactly the way it should be done (in my opinion): adding to the Android experience without getting in its way."}

My wife bought it from OfficeMax because ASUS was a reputable brand and it was a 10.1\" tablet for around 200.\n\nThe power button would not work. It would only turn on if you plugged in the cord, and it wouldn't turn off or reset. So within the return period, and I thought I just got a lemon, so I bought it here. I had to RMA it almost immediately. I got it back, and it would not turn on (the deep sleep issue that you will soon become familiar with if you ignore my warning and buy this. They told me to RMA it, but I couldn't get around to it for about a week or two. On a lark, I pulled it back out of the box, and sure enough it was working as expected. For a third time I re-set everything up on my tablet, and then the display randomly quit, and appears to be malfunctioning (as it is working via HDMI).\n\nSupposedly there things you can do to deal with the deep sleep issue, but they are out of the norm for most tablets and most platforms I've had experience with. I'm pretty flexible normally, I've set up workarounds and happily stuck to them when the tradeoff was a little convenience for a lot of price. So when I say this is unreasonable, it's not coming from a place of laziness.\n\nThe lone bright spot has been dealing with the customer service. They are pretty prompt in replying and in a situation where bad CS would be the final straw, they have been pretty nice to work with.\n\nStill, it is no wonder why these tablets are so inexpensive so soon after they first hit the market--and the hassle still isn't worth the price.

The 300t was good until I dropped it and of course after a failed repair attempt I figured I would upgrade to the latest and greatest. My biggest issue with them is while they have the gorilla glass 2 digitizer, it is still very fragile. I have gone through 2 of these tablets in less than a year because of the first screen cracking and the second one developed a very faint crack that I didn't notice at first because the screen would no work all the time until one day I tapped it in the right spot and effectively killed half the screen with the 2 inch crack that formed. ON the software side of things some things that never worked properly were asus bloatware like asus weather that crashed every time, on the 300 it never updated properly. The email widget only worked sometimes and overall the tablet ran slow. And now my problem is I bought a 60 dollar case to protect my $275 investment and now I am put off of buying another one because I know its going to just happen again most likely. This tablet was what helped me with my various duties during the week and my source of entertainment on the road and now I can't use it and I am stuck with running my phone down trying to do everything on that.

Battery life is great, especially with the supplemental battery power from the keyboard.  Screen clarity, definition, and color are excellent.  The tablet is very light, fast, and responsive, and with the keyboard, I am able to augment storage with combined 64Gb USB and SD drives. There are newer, more powerful tablets out there, but this one will meet my needs for years to come."}

The built-in speakers are much better than I would have expected.  If you've never owned a tablet and you're looking for a great tablet for a great price, this is the one to buy.  Highly recommended.  My only complaint is that the charger cable is pretty short, limiting it's capabilities to use it while it's charging."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I had originally bought around two years ago and was absolutely in love with it for the first year.  Sure it ran slow at moments while using it to take notes, but I wasn't too overly irritated with that fact.  Going into the second year I used it mostly for my books in my classes so I could buy those cheaper.  This past year I had been having issues with it keeping charge and found myself needing to constantly charge it while using it.\n\nThen one day while trying to use it to study for my final, the tablet decided not to turn on.  I looked up the issue and found that there are many users with this problem where the light is green while charging though it will not turn on.  I figured it to be a motherboard issue, and I could easily take it somewhere to fix, but why mess with a tablet I've been having issues with?  I do not want to put more money into this tablet than I already have since I already spent too much money on it in the first place, due to getting it around the time it was released.\n\nI had issues where my apps will force close on me and I will loose recordings and notes from my classes.  Most items I have last five or more years, not two years.  I will join the many others in tossing this tablet aside and hope that my next one won't crap out after two years of gentle usage."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "Warning!! I looked trough the reviews and should've listened to those warning about the sluggishness of the tablet. I figured I would only use it for basic things like web browsing and reading the wall street journal. The first few days I was extremely happy with my purchase although it lagged a bit even fresh out of the box. However by day four it is basically unusable. Apps crash constantly and have to be restarted. I can't even scroll down a web page and it takes up to four seconds for the screen to auto rotate. Another issue I've had twice now is that it will randomly restart and get stuck on the loading screen. To get past this you need to reset the tablet, which causes all the apps and information you had saved to be deleted. You can do much much better."}

It has become extremely slow and unresponsive when using simple apps, such as the browser and kindle. Every 10 minutes it completely freezes to a black screen and then it reboots. Don't have many apps installed, but uninstalled non-stock to no avail. This tablet can't handle the most basic tasks without freezing. Also, the screen has started to separate. There is a noticeable gap between the metal and the glass, which is bulging out, and it pops in and out every time you touch it. Plus, I have the keyboard dock with it which is so poorly designed. When attached and opened to the \"laptop\" angle, the tablet falls backwards, because the placement of the keyboard does not take into account the weight of the tablet."}

I bought a 6 ft cord from this site but it has too small of a tip to fit all the way inside the housing and it falls out if you don't hold it in place with tape.

That's the only reason I give it 2 stars (it's more like 1.25 - 1.5 stars!).\n\nI bought this to replace a TF-300T, and it turned out to NOT be an upgrade. The battery actually drained much faster on my NEW 700 than it did on my year-old 300. The metal back looks pretty sweet, but it gets HOT - even in a case, it became hard to hold onto. The Android version updates did not update much about the screen layout. I expected the  menus to move to the top of the screen, and the navigation to move to the middle. They did not. It felt like using an old version of Android (4.0 or 4.1); that was frustrating. The tablet also lagged - BADLY. It felt like waiting forever, and half-expecting the tablet to restart itself often. It did sometimes. I thought I was buying a better tablet than the 300 I had before, and I was very disappointed.\n\nSave up the money to get a new tablet with better memory and better processors. but if you're saving money by buying a $200 or less older Asus, go for the TF300T.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I have never been one to buy the bleeding edge of technology. Whether it be a desktop PC, Laptop, cell phone, or tablet, in thirty plus years of building, installing, using, and repairing computers of all shapes and sizes I have only bought the latest and greatest two times. Very rarely is there a need for me to to pay the premium price so it is my policy to let others buy at the top dollar level and bring the prices down for people like me (And also discover all of the bugs so the manufacturer can get them fixed before I buy).\n\nAll of that said I think this is a great tablet! I have been eyeing this model for well over a year. I purchased it's little brother an Asus TF300T at a bargain price about a 1-1/2 year ago and have truly loved it. But I kept watching for a great deal on this model. Finally gave up after about six months of searching.\n\nThen recently, my wife's Kindle Fire HD started acting flakey (rebooting for no reason while she was reading), I began looking at possible replacements, seriously considering the Nexus 7.. She mentioned that she would like to have a larger screen because her eyesight is not the greatest. She enjoys playing several games, as well as reading her books. So I was going to buy her a TF300, but in my search ran across the TF700 brand new for $213. That was less than I paid for my TF300 over a year ago and far below the original price of $499.00! Also over $100.00 less than the Nexus 7-2013. I ordered it for her, along with a decent case. The day it arrived I set it up with her library and games. She hasn't stopped smiling since.\n\nI am very impressed with it. The video is much sharper than my TF300. I have customized my TF300 with a custom ROM and kernel, OC'ed it to 1.8 Ghz and this tablet is just as fast out of the box with everything stock. I can only imagine how well it would perform if I customized it. But that is not to be until after it is out of warranty and maybe not even then. My wife is perfectly happy with it as is and when she is happy then I am happy. :-)\n\nBe forewarned however, do not expect Nexus 7-2013 performance or performance as fast as the current generation tablets. This is three year old technology. Unless you are willing to customize this tablet which will void the warranty. But it is a decently performing tablet and suits my wife's need very well. An she hasn't seen any of the lag issues and freeze-ups described by others in their reviews. Not sure what the difference is, but she is running in performance mode at 1.5 Ghz and it is more than adequate. The bottom line - it blows any other tablet in the same class and generation out of the water.\n\nAnd as far as people whining about it not having a USB port without the keyboard dock, DID YOU READ THE SPECS AND RESEARCH IT BEFORE YOU BOUGHT IT????"}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "When you are looking in the tablet world, you are basically looking at an iPad, a Samsung Galaxy Tab, a Nexus, or an Asus Transformer (there are some notable other devices out there, but for the most part this is what the main options are).\n\nIf you want the best hardware, I believe the iPad 4 is the best thing walking.\nThe problem I have with the iPad is the lack of options. There is no side loading apps, no easy expansion, and lack of customization to my desires. This is an Apple thing, and it puts me off. I'm not starting a debate, but I fall into the category that I prefer non-Apple devices.\n\nI have opted for an Android device because of this (for my phone as well) and then it came down to hardware.\nAt one point, the TF700T was the best hardware out there by far. Now it is not. But it is still really darn good.\n\nMind you, if you want to compare... apples to apples (I swear I didn't mean that pun) you would want to compare the Asus TF701 to the iPad 4 to make some comparisons. I would still opt for the Asus with the Tegra 4 processor and 2560x1600 display.\n\nBut of course, I opted for the TF700 instead. Why? Because it was $200. With my dock it totaled $300.\nThat's half the price of the best tablets out there and more than half the benefits.\n\nSo my reasoning for choosing this tablet follows this line of thought:\nIt's Android, and it is far less expensive (both as noted above)\nThis is a full 1920x1200 resolution screen, and looks darn good (not as good as a retina display, but far better than anything else out there)\nThe dock is a dock, not a mere keyboard (though having a physical keyboard is a big perk for me). It has a USB and SD slot for easy attachments of flash drives etc... and it contains it's own battery so it can actually charge the tablet if the tablet battery is low.\nWhile I feel the best sizing for a tablet is 8\" (not the 7\" or 10\" which are typical) I felt the 10\" gave a vast difference compared to my phone (5\")\nand good screen real estate for working on \"office\" type documents and remote access to my desktop computers. (side note: the USB port on the dock actually comes in handy for a mouse connection for my remote desktop sessions, just plug in and it recognizes and works automatically)\n\nThings I wish were better:\nFor the specs, the tablet seems laggy. When there are too many apps running in the background the whole thing starts to lag. Mind you, it is still usable, but slow. I tend to use a quick kill app to close background apps and fee up RAM.\nIce Cream Sandwich is a good version of the OS, but it is outdated now. Having Kit Kat would add Trim support (so your flash memory doesn't clutter giving you performance degradation over time).\nThere is no Delete key on the dock. Minor deal, but it's annoying. (and granted, this is more of a dock review item than for the tablet)\n\nSome other thoughts:\nSwiftkey works great on the tablet, but doesn't play well with TeamViewer and the dock. I've reverted to the stock Asus keyboard (which isn't bad)\nOffice 365 does not natively load on tablets (it is not supported). However, you can side load it (I exported the apk from my phone) and it loads and runs well. The hitch...is that it doesn't recognize the dock, so you can't use the keyboard which sort of defeats the purpose of it.\nIf you like to tinker and will root this (a friend of mine has rooted his) this thing won't ever lag like I have stated earlier. It will run smoothly and without issue.\n\nOverall I am happy with my purchase. I have used this for about 2 months now and love it.\nMy primary uses have been media (netflix, various games, e-reader) and remote connecting to a PC (home and work)."}

After 1 year the camera does not work, we get the message gallery is stopped.  I talked to Asus.  I tried a different camera and gallery per their suggestion.  When that did not work, I did the factory reset per their suggestion.  I lost all of our apps and had to reload,  the camera still does not work.  I have looked on the internet and it seems to be an  ASUS PROBLEM.  For the price of the item I would expect it to work longer than a year.\n\nUpdate 09-01-2014:  I chatted with Asus customer service again.  They told me I wass still under warranty and coulde return to be worked on.  They issued an RMA and I returned.  We received the tablet and it seems to be fixed.  I would suggest anyone with a problem chat with customer service and see if your tablt can be fixed."}

And at first, it performed pretty well.  After a year, however, the tablet no longer stayed clipped into the keyboard, which led to it slipping out and dropping on more than one occasion.  The fact that it only had one back-facing speaker bugged me from the start, too.  Later, it started getting pop-up error messages and lagging in performance.  Even after killing all tasks or rebooting, it was slow.  Now, it gives me the boot screen and can't be restarted, even with the cold reboot.  It's a paper weight.\n\nI got a lot of use and enjoyment out of it, but for the $700 (tablet, keyboard, accessories) I paid, it was not worth it.  I am shopping for a different brand now, and I'll probably try to keep the cost under $400 if this is the kind of life one should expect from a tablet.\n\nAs I am shopping, however, I am finding a feature included with the Asus that is hard to find with other tablets: the micro-HDMI port included on this tablet is a great feature."}

It was my first tab so I blame my lack of experience and my reliance on brand name.. The main issue was due to the mere 1GB of ram, which made using it a major pain in the rear.. I assumed ASUS knew what they were doing, but clearly they DO NOT!!! To release a tab in 2012 with only 1GB of ram is an insult to every person who buys it..\n\nWhile it was ok when it came to running most apps when it came to browsing the web it felt like I was back in the 90s.. Pages took forever to load and it took ages just to get the keyboard to pop up.. Even this level of performance required clearing the memory first because otherwise it was simply unusable..\n\nAlso, while ASUS made the sound quality of the speaker(s) a selling point in reality the sound quality was horrible.. Unless you use it in the quietest of quiet place you can forget hearing anything!\n\nLastly, ASUS support is by far the worst I've ever experiences!!!\n\nUltimately, this experience has taught me that while ASUS is great at PC components (video cards, motherboards, etc.) when it comes to consumer electronics (tablet, laptops, etc.) the company leaves much to be desired.\n\nSTAY AWAY!!!! I recommend Samsung because the difference in quality is night and day!!!"}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "UPDATE SEPTEMBER 8, 2014:\n\nI bought this tablet on June 20, 2014. Within a few days I had to send it to ASUS for the previously mentioned performance issues (See original review below). Despite the fact that I was in regular contact with their customer service department the device got lost and had to be tracked down. It was tracked down and returned repaired about 10 weeks later. Upon receiving this I found that the screen had not been properly seated into the frame and was loose along the top edge. I contacted customer service again and was told to send it back again. Because so much time had passed and because my frustration with them so evident the customer service representative said that instead of sending this back to ASUS for repair, she would see that I would receive a replacement in its place. This took an additional two weeks.\n\nI received my replacement just a few days ago. Over the last three days I have rebooted and restarted this thing probably 20 times because programs won't open, programs shut down, programs don't respond or the device won't open or the devise will shut down or the devise simply won't respond. I have had to return to the ridiculous dependability of my three- or four-year-old HTC Rezound as well as my nine-year-old Acer laptop because even with their ages and performance problems they perform better than this tablet. In that this tablet was to replace those items I am a angry to have to put them to continued use.\n\nThe only thing I can say about ASUS's tablets and level of technological competency at this point is that they are horrible. Clown-like. An embarrassment. I bought this tablet and a dedicated ASUS keyboard dock a full 12 weeks ago. I have had a tablet in hand to use for about two of those weeks. I have had zero usefulness out of three device opportunities--the original purchase, the repaired original, and now the replacement. ASUS should be incredibly embarrassed for their inept quality and their patent failure for getting me a device that works given that they had the better part of three months to get it right. Put it this way. In my original review I mention hurtling the tablet into the woods across the street from my house. It's been so long that the entire wooded parcel has been stripped of vegetation and now there are complete houses standing there. I'm serious.\n\nI have decided to use this tablet only for writing. Let's hope that, at over $300 for the tablet and board that it can bear this heavy burden lest I have to go to the next step up in tablets which will require both a hammer and a chisel. Honestly, I won't even donate this thing because it's just ridiculous.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW JUNE, 2014:\n\nWell the first thing that you should know is that unlike every device I have ever had, this one requires an ASUS brand-specific USB cable and power plug. You cannot charge it without this. Nor can you charge it through any type of extension product such as a power strip or USB line extension cord. Unless you are a witch.\n\nThis thing is slow as molasses for even the most mundane things like typing up an angry and disparaging letter to ASUS to let them know just how bad you think this item is. It crashes more than a room full of toddlers after both lunch and outside play time on a hot day. The video, despite being \"blazing, blistering, blastingly fast,\"...well, that's really just a matter of perspective now, isn't it? Fast compared to what? To the annual growth rate of an elm? Discernably fast? Sorry, but no. Let us reference the letter again. Sort of like the Portlandia bit about sitting at the stop sign insisting that the other person go first.\n\"You go.\"\n\"No, you go.\"\n\"No, really. I insist.\"\nI was able to both shave my dear Uncle Jeremy's backhair off and then watch it grow back up while waiting for this thing to accept my text. And that's a really bad hassle when I am dependent upon this for holding onto and regaling in every word that I feed it. \"Please, for god's sake, the word is \"the.\" I told you that 30 minutes ago. Didn't I? It's been so long I simply cannot remember.\"\nInsofar as video quality and playback? Crash and crash again and then lag and then just burst into flames. Nothing stellar about this at all. It's actually hardly even worth using for video. Although, if you like epic movies and mini-series it will do well in playing back old Frasier episodes with those sorts of time frames. Why enjoy 22 minutes of fun when you can endure 3 1/2 hours spent playing that same program? I think that they consider this a value-added feature.\n\nThe beautiful side of this tablet is that still images are really gorgeous. Awesome colors and spectacular resolution are its hallmarks. It's fundamentally a tablet \"trophy wife,\" but without the burden of being expensive. Great looking, but without a lick of sense where it matters most.\n\nBattery life is exceptional. I've been running across the Internet, docs, and images for the last 3 1/2 hours and still have power. I optimistically bought a well-priced dock for it and both can probably last another few hours. Which is great because I'd really like to start that second Frasier episode.\n\nFinally, like the trophy wife it is very slim and doesn't weigh a lot, so when I get finished with this review and hurl this into the woods across the street I'm sure it will go quite far, probably with a very gentle, avian arc to its flight trajectory. If YouTube will accept a live feed, then I'll set the camera to record the video upon launching. Wish me luck. And lament with me now that I have a great ASUS tablet dock to remember her by.\n\nOkay. It LITERALLY just took me over 30 minutes to install the Amazon Appstore app and retrieve and install a previously purchased app from that site. Just-a-saying."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I bought this when it first came out, and like everyone else, I thought it was fabulous when I first got it. Then the problems started. First, within the first few weeks, the keyboard/docking station quit charging, so I called ASUS customer service and after a long conversation and some attempts to solve the problem, I was told I had to send it to ASUS for service. After about 3 weeks, I got it back. Right out of the box, the keyboard wouldn't work with my tablet, so I called ASUS again, and this time it was determined that I needed to send in the tablet for repair. Three weeks later, what looked to be a new tablet came back. Then the charger stopped working. It would heat up and I'd have to put it in the freezer for a few minutes to cool it down. I just ordered a new charger on Amazon, rather than call ASUS about that. The next thing that happened was that the little plastic \"hooks\" that kept the tablet and keyboard secured to each other broke, and the keyboard wouldn't stay attached to the tablet. Not long after that, the plastic piece that covers the mechanism where it attaches to the tablet broke off completely, which made it impossible for the tablet and keyboard to stay attached at all, especially when folded up. At that point, I decided I would only use the keyboard if it was crucial when I had a lot to type. Then I noticed that it started to slow way down and then started feeling hot in the upper left corner when I used it for more than an hour or two. Not long after that, it started just re-booting randomly when I had been on it for awhile. Then one night, it shut off and when it tried to re-boot, I just got the ASUS logo and the dots going in a circle. So I made another call to ASUS and after 2 hours with the guy on the phone, where he had me completely wipe it of all data back to the factory settings,  I was told he couldn't help me, and I could send it in to them, or because it was now out of warranty, it might be cheaper to just take in to someone locally. A few days later, when I took it to Micro Center service, the guy there confirmed what I was afraid of: it was \"bricked\", meaning it was now just an expensive paperweight (brick) because it would be at least $200-$300 to send it out to their repair people, and in his opinion I should just buy a new tablet. According to him, it was a hardware issue, most likely a faulty hard drive (factory defect). So, there it is. I spent $700 with tax and shipping about a year and half ago for the tablet and keyboard which are now useless pieces of hardware, only worthy of the \"computer graveyard.\"  I recently purchased a new laptop/notebook computer, and there was no way I would even consider an ASUS computer after that experience. I bought a Lenovo Yoga, so I could just fold it back and use it as a tablet. The only problem with that is that there are Android apps that you just can't get for Windows 8. Will I buy another Droid tablet? Maybe. But if I do, it definitely won't be an ASUS!"}

Finally gave up the ghost when I removed it from the keyboard dock one handed and the screen cracked corner-to-corner.  The tf700 seems much more substantial with the metal rear shell and gorilla glass II screen.  I had been experiencing numerous crashes while playing high power usage games like Call of heroes and Knights & Dragons.  I attributed this to the much more ram hungry HD graphics processor.  The tablet would crash seemingly for no reason till I noticed that it was doing automatic updating just prior to the crash. Put all the apps in manual update mode and that problem has pretty much gone away.  Probably why Asus made the change to 2 gigs of RAM with the tf701.  Suspect that they knew there was a problem, but it was a cost issue...  Would have given a higher rating had there not been the initial crash issues.\nMaybe I should have gone with the tf701, but for me it was a matter of money.  Just couldn't bring myself to spend the extra $100+ for the tf701.  Wish there was a simple upgrade for the RAM without buying a complete new model...  Interestingly enough I paid $50 less for the tf700 than I paid for the tf300 a year and a half before.  Another item on my wishlist...  Wish I could permanently remove 90% of the bloatware without voiding my warranty."}

But they survive the use that the Transformer would not.\n\nI have been able to improve over the manufacturer's software by installing Cyanogenmod 11 - no more lag and no space wasted for the un-removable ASUS applications which are not as good as others you can download.\n\nI hate that the manufacturer's DRM makes it easier to brick this tablet than other brands. If you even once render both the OS and the Recovery unbootable, there is no way to recover the device without sending it back for repair. Other devices have a protocol to rewrite the ROM and unbrick the device, but ASUS or nVidia encrypts theirs so that only they can use it."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I am a college student, and this tablet should be more than enough for most of college students. I am not a tech-gig, so I don't know much about the spec of this tablet or any tablet, but I've used ipad and samsung galexy from friends and school rental. I honestly don't see the different between this tablet and the other twos that are way more expensive. The display is better than most of the tablet in the market at this price. A lot of you might say this isn't fast, but I don't expect computer speed with tablet. Ipad is not as fast as computer either. This tablet is compatible with ipad in terms of the speed, I believe.\n\nI recommend this tablet for college student who needs it for school work. Reading pdf, powerpoint slides, not-too-big spreadsheet can be worked with this tablet very well. Checking emails, doing facebook and online shopping such as Amazon can be done without any problem.\n\nI've play a few games and it ran smoothly and fast. If it is running slow, I closed out other windows, and it worked faster.\n\nI didn't buy the keyboard dock, mainly because I read so much about the crack from the keyboard dock. Instead, I bought a wireless  tablet keyboard at $9.99 from Amazon, and this works great as well. (You have to pay more than 100 dollars from keyboard dock.) I am actually typing this review with wireless bluetooth keyboard.\n\nBefore I bought this, major concern was that many people say that Asus tablet is so fragile that the screen cracks very easily. I was a little worried about this, but I would say this tablet should be kept in its case all the time. I bought a case at about 13 dollars, and this case protects the screen. Most of times, I put this tablet with case in my backpack, and I've not noticed any risk of cracking the screen as long as I keep this in the case.\n\nThe tablet, bluetooth keyboard, and tablet case all together costed me less than a single ipad. I don't understand people spending more than 500 dollars for an ipad when there is a great substitute that is a lot cheaper."}

It has the best camera of any tablet, probably the best screen; and feels awesome in your hands.  The build quality is superior and it is aesthetically pleasing to the eye.  I still sometimes regret sending it back, but I had to because I couldn't live with the slow speed of the processor.  I'm quite sure the problem lies with the WiFi configuration, not the processor.

Once you have the dock, this tablet can serve on just about any need you can think of. As expandable as any laptop, its equipped with an HDMI out, USB port, SD card slot, Micro SD card slot, 32GB of internal memory, PLUS stunning NVIDIA GPU and dual core CPU, there's not that much to complain about. When I travel, I take a 32GB SD card, 32GB Micro SD, and a 64GB flash drive for a total of 160GB of storage space, and can plug into any TV with an HDMI port.\n\nThe only real issue is the memory deficiency, with only 1GB (although the new tf701 has 2GB) of RAM, which is not ideal if you plan on keeping lots of apps or browser tabs open. A few other things to mention are that the weight and balance aren't quite right, so the tablet sits top-heavy when upright in the dock. Also, the keyboard is a bit smaller than what you'll be used to, but once you adjust you'll get the hang of it.\n\nBut overall, this is the best tablet on the market when I bought it, and if I were buying a tablet today I would make the same decision (but the newer model, tf701)"}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I'm so disappointed with this product. I bought the tablet together with the dock, paying a total of $550.\n\nHere are the problems I have:\n\n The tablet restarts randomly out of the blue (no matter if I'm using it or if it's on standby) and crashes. I did a couple of factory resets but the problems were not solved. Lately the random restarts and crashes became so frequent that I decided to give up on using it.\n\n The internet browsing is very slow and kind a jerky/choppy.\n\n GPS sucks! Really, it sucks big time! Not reliable at all! It used to take normally more than 10 min (even 15-20 min) to lock on GPS satellites, even outdoor and standing. Then, out of the blue, it loses the signal.\n\n Very picky charger (gosh, now I hate the fact that I didn't get a tablet with a standard microUSB connector). The USB charging (from the PC) it didn't always work initially and now it doesn't work at all. Then again, the car charging was working initially, and then it didn't work at all. Eventually I noticed that even with the original charger the keyboard doesn't want to charge at all sometimes. That's irking me a lot!\nI even bought a brand new USB charging/data cable and the tablet still doesn't charge at all from time to time.\nThen there is a quality issue with the USB plug: the plug's jacket cover came out completely of the metallic part (and this only after 6 month of use, with no more than 4-5/months). Now, although I push the jacket back, it keeps coming out time every time I pull the connector out from the adapter or PC's USB port. Anyhow, I ordered a replacement cable from DX and I hope will solve the problem.\n\n As well, the battery charging status (the system one or the one showed by different apps/widgets) is not reliable at all - it stays at 100% for a long time, then is starts going down to 40-50% very fast, an then the tablet shuts down and need a full recharge.\n\n The keyboard dock, although appeared to work initially, turned out eventually to be affected by the fast battery drain problem; after about 7 months it stopped completely to charge and work and it ended up in the garbage.  \n\nWell, this is my fourth ASUS product (fifth, if I count the keyboard dock separately) with a lot of issues. Firstly it was a WiFi USB stick, secondly I had major problems with a motherboard, then with a graphic card (plus it took ASUS more than 1 month to send me back the repaired card) and now this tablet. Well, wrapping it up, I'm pretty sure: NO MORE ASUS for me from now on (and not only because what happen to me, but as well because I read so many bad reviews about the Asus' quality issues and its bad support; reading the bad reviews about the quality issues and service problems for the TF701t make me think that ASUS it's going somehow downhill).\n\nAnother consequence of what I've been through is that I will never ever buy tablets or smartphones with proprietary connectors. So all the devices I'll buy from now on will have standard USB chargers/connectors, which besides being very convenient is as well Eco-friendly."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "First off Amazon has been fantastic both with shipping the product out and handling the returns. I have nothing but praise for them.\n\nThe product, on the other hand, has been nothing but a nightmare, and I can't stress this enough, please research it before you buy.\n\nFirst, and I knew this very well when I bought it the first time, Asus used horrible NAND memory (it's on board memory) on this tablet. It's guaranteed to slow down to a crawl within 8 months to a year. This can be fixed with an unofficial TRIM app that requires you to root the tablet. I'm fairly tech savvy so it wouldn't have been a problem for me, but for the average user you'd wind up with a nice looking brick within a year of use.\n\n2nd, the tablet is known for having random battery, screen, and system board issues, which I wasn't completely aware of until I experienced it first hand. The first TF700T I bought charged and ran fine the day I got it to replace my Acer Iconia A200 (which I'm really upset I didn't keep). The next day it randomly powered off (even though it had 50% battery life remaining), would not turn back on, and would not charge. I tried everything I could find to try to solve the issue but the tablet would not turn or even charge.\n\nI returned that tablet and as soon as I got my refund (which was very, very quick) I ordered a replacement. My gut instincts told me to buy something different, but I had already committed to the Asus by buying a dock, case, and screen protector. The 2nd Asus charged fine, but would not turn on. Again I tried everything I could possibly find by could not get the tablet to turn on. Again Amazon was very quick with processing the return and the refund, which will now be going to a Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4.\n\nWhile researching the problems I had with the TF700T I found a laundry list of cases where the tablet would not charge, would not power on, or would not display anything. In most cases the tablets had to be sent to Texas for repair which took weeks between shipping out, getting fixed, and shipping back. If the only problem this tablet had was with the memory Asus used I'd at least recommend it to those who felt comfortable rooting the tablet and setting up a TRIM app, but with everything I've seen I wouldn't recommend this to anybody.\n\nIf you're looking for a good, basic Android tablet I'd recommend the Acer Iconia A200 (my previous tablet). It's not the fastest tablet out there but it has a full USB port (great for external drives and thumb drives), has good battery life, and a decent screen. If you're looking for a full featured Android tablet that will knock the socks off an iPad go for the Samsung Galaxy Tab Note 10.1 2014 edition or the Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4. They're expensive but you can't beat Samsung for their quality and full Android OS."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I've lived with this tablet for 18 months, and at the end I seriously regret spending the $400.\n\nThe most egregious issue is the performance. There are two causes for the poor performance; memory and wi-fi. The memory is too limited at 1 GB, although one can chalk that up to trying to keep the costs lower. In addition, the transfer mechanisms used internally for memory access are poorly done, which is simply wretched engineering. Bad ASUS.\n\nThe Wi-Fi performance issues are curious. (I'm an engineer. I find really stupid things to be curiosities.) Various experiments have uncovered that there is either some inanely stupid coding in the driver, or that there are hardware issues present; but packets are dropped like popcorn in a movie theater. The browser (or email client, or RSS reader, or ... whatever) then falls back on the timeout to try again. Eventually a re-request is made and the data gets through. In the meantime you've given up on email and gone back to quill pen and snail mail because it offers higher throughput.\n\nNext on the list of woe is stability. At least once a week, and occasionally multiple times a day, the tablet just restarts. Usually when switching apps, or starting a new app up. Everything will freeze, and then you will notice the dreaded \"Black Line of Death\"; a single row of black pixels at the top of the screen. That means that the system has committed seppuku and will soon be restarting. Whatever you were working on is gone. So sad ...\n\nI still use the wretched thing, as I've too much Scotch blood to buy a different one yet. I can read e-Books on it, and mostly finish one before a restart. Email will work, after a fashion. Web browsing is out of the question. Eventually it will suffer an \"accident\" and get replaced by something that can actually be as useful as my phone."}

I tried rooting the tablet and it still did nothing to improve performance.\n\nI also found that the size was a little more than I thought I needed. The 10in screen is great for watching videos and reading magazines, but can be unwieldy if you don't have it laying down or on a stand.

The touchpad can be locked, but that's a pain when you want to use it along with the keyboard.\n\nFirst chance that I get, I'll be trying some custom ROMs instead of the factory ASUS version, but I see some reviewers of custom ROMs saying that they fix some issues, but others remain.

When I picked it up I only wanted to do a few things: read PDFs (for grad school), watch Youtube, browse the web/social networks, and check email. The tablet was essentially for very basic stuff, as my HTC One was considerably more powerful and I bought most games for it.\n\nAll I can say is that Jellybean must have broken this tablet, as it is the slowest thing I've ever encountered. I thought the original Kindle Fire was a bit clunky, but it seemed as smooth as butter compared to this thing.\n\nConstant lag, even on just a UI level and from a clean boot. Even sliding the app drawer caused the tablet to slow down or even lock up at times. Any \"modern\" app (read: Gmail, Dropbox, even Chrome) would drag the entire system to a crawl. Multitasking was impossible. If I only had one program open and used Settings to disable nearly every other app, then SOMETIMES it would work. But most of the time? Complete lockup.\n\nI feel bad because all I wanted was a simple table to do simple things, and I did extensive research on reviews (including here on amazon, but also all over the internet) and it made it sound good. From what it looks like, it's because it's 1 GB ram is lacking, but in addition it uses an outdated transfer method so the ram is much too slow for a modern mobile OS. As such, the tablet is sluggish from the ground up.\n\nI even tried rooting it and putting a custom Rom on; still no dice, the tablet didn't move a muscle. The only thing I didn't do was attempt to downgrade back to ice cream sandwich, but at that point I'd already boxed it back up and sent it back.\n\nPoint being: I'm sure this tablet was awesome when it came out, but now (in 2014) it is a slow, cumbersome mess. Spend a few extra bucks and buy something like the MeMo Pad (or a lot more bucks and just get a Nexus 10 or an iPad Air) if you're looking for a 10 inch tablet.

But the internal storage causes everything to be slow.\n\nCustom ROMs can help tweak and make it usable most of the time, but it still runs into issues. This is made worse by the 1 GB RAM limit which causes browsers to lag a lot with multiple tabs and apps running in the background.\n\nOverall this was a step up over the previous version, but it wasn't fully executed and missed the mark. This leaves the price for the tablet and dock to be too high. I've heard good things about the new version of this tablet that came out recently, but most people are done with Asus after the many issues found in the TF201 series and the slow storage of the TF700.\n\nTheir budget tablets seem to be a much better bang for the buck.

The problems are notorious in the forums. Buy something else!"}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "The TF700tT has some nice features, but they're diminished by some flaws. First and foremost is the poorly designed latching pins for the keyboard. After a little better then a month one of the broke off in the course of normal use.  The keyboard latch pins are tiny plastic tabs, literally the size of a healthy grain of rice,  that hang off an internal plastic framework.  The connect points between the pin and internal framework are very thin and other wise unsupported, so eventually the pressure of being inserted into the keyboard, combined with any physical jostling, bumping, or god forbid dropping  (even cased) will cause the pins to snap off.  Unfortunately, as Asus customer support really doesn't want to see this defect as covered under warranty, they quoted me a $$$ repair cost and 2-4 weeks of away time.  So with the help of a magnify bench light, micro tweezers, and a good super glue, I got i back in and reinforced the unbroken side.  Asus should have made them metal, or at least screw/adhesived them to the casing.  I might have blames myself for tabs breaking,  but this the SECOND exact same model that i've had the latch tabs beak off of, an I really babied this one.\n\nThe other big problem is the amount of OEM bloat ware on the thing.  On a straight from the factory machine, it doesn't seem all that bad, but once you do all the firmware updates (official Asus stuff they push out) and bring it up to the latest version of Android, The tablet starts to get noticeably slugish.  Removing the OEM bloatware is a bit of a pain as it requires a bit of trial and error, but well worth is as the performance improves quite a bit."}

However, this has been my experience in chronological order:\n1. Christmas December 2012: TF 700 is opened and found to be dead on arrival (DOA). Hey it happens no big deal.\n\n2. The day after Christmas: Went and exchanged it without any problems.\n\n3. The subsequent days using the tablet I had it crash every hour at least once or twice with several cold boots to follow.\n\n4. From January 2013 until February 2013 the product continues to drain the battery at an excessive rate; even when powered off. As well, the screen begins to develop a random black line across it no matter what application you have running.\n\n5. Called Amazon and they told me to contact the manufacturer because it was under the one year warranty and I could not use my square trade warranty. I understand fair enough. After contacting Asus they had the audacity to inform me that I had to ship them their broken tablet at my own expense... Furthermore, they \"fixed\" the tablet. Yes, they did fix the excessive battery draining, but they did not fix the screen from flickering nor the multiple crashes.\n\n6. The experience in using the tablet caused me not to use for most of 2013. Seriously this was a tablet I was supposed to use on a daily basis for school. Luckily for me I was given another tablet from my work.\n\n7. January 2014 the screen has a hairline crack from the top of the tablet to the bottom. Seriously, I had not used it and kept it closed with the keyboard docking station; so WTF? I called Amazon and used my square trade policy to have the tablet returned to the manufacturer and I got a full refund plus a little extra because I wanted the refund on an Amazon gift card.\n\nThe bottom line is that I am disappointed with this product and even more so with the customer experience in dealing with Asus. Please do not buy this product."}

Once using the tablet, its painfully slow, my screen flickers, and there are random touch spots that stay active when not even touching it.\n\nKeyboard dock seemed like a nifty concept, however once docked the tablet tends to freak out. Rotating its screen left to right until i disconnect and re-connect it again. Also it liked to pull up its own on-screen keyboard when the dock would already be connected?\n\nLag lag lag, glitch, lag, app frozen, app randomly closed with error, and then lag.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I bought this tablet a while ago and am just now getting rid of it.  Figured I would add a review.\n\nI was attracted to the docking capability and the relatively low bloatware compared to what other manufacturers put on their tablets.  Unfortunately, both of those were misfires.\n\nI've reviewed the dock separately, but it was a disaster.  The dock would lose keyboard and touchpad connectivity with the tablet constantly, especially if the dock hinge was moved at all.  When that happened, I couldn't type anything until I disconnected and reseated the tablet - the on-screen keyboard won't come up if the dock is connected.\n\nFurthermore, the tablet itself is excruciatingly slow, with a noticeable lag to everything it does.  Even something as simple as waking the tablet, opening the browser and starting a website regularly takes 30 seconds or more, even in \"performance\" mode, whereas I can do the same in 10 seconds on my Android phone.  I tried resetting the tablet to factory default, thinking that the apps I installed were causing issues, but that made no difference.\n\nI've seen benchmarks showing that the TF700 performs much better when running with a stock version of Android.  While Asus doesn't put much bloatware on the tablet, apparently the little bit that is there causes a lot of the issues.  I didn't want to root my device, but I tried replacing some of the core features with better ones from the app store (e.g., SwiftKey and the Chrome browser), but that actually made performance significantly worse.\n\nThe tablet does have a nice screen, and works great for watching movies and such.  However, it's dreadfully slow on many other tasks, making it a pain to use.  I'm selling mine, and glad to be rid of it."}

I would use it so much I almost totally abandoned my laptop, actually, I even gave the laptop to my children. It took great photos and videos. I went to Florida with my family twice this year and the photos were excellent. Disney and Sea World pics were amazing. I did a panorama shot of the Shamo stadium and it was flawless. WiFi connectivity and streaming through my Onkyo 608 receiver via the mini HDMI was just simply a dream. All in all this tablet was a top buy and even my wife who has the Samsung Tab 2 thinks it was a better tablet.\nHOWEVER\nOn December 11, 2013, 7 months after I bought this amazing machine, it died. It will not turn on, it charged for an entire night till the light was green and when pressing the on bottom for 5 secs it came up and showed that it needed charging, but it was fully charged. I live in Jamaica and there is anyone here that can repair the tablet or who I think is capable of doing it. I now have a 7 month old food tray that cost me near $400 and there seems to be no recourse as the return date expired after 2 months.\n\nI have checked online and several other persons have had similar experiences with this tablet. It is really tough to go and spend near $400 and have this happen and I need this tablet for both work and school because doing a masters requires having this machine in an effort for you to be \"kept up to speed\". If there is anyone out there that can assist me with repairing this machine, I would appreciate you making contact with me rogerroomjes@yahoo.com. Buying a new machine at this time is a way last option given my tight budget with school fees and children school fees as well.\n\nEven though I am so hurt for this happening, I had to give it a full 2 stars because of the great machine that this was before it died.\n\nJust an update. The tablet is fine. What had happened is that my children didn't disconnect the tablet from the receiver before using it. It was connected via the hdmi cable. So it was still looking for an output source. What I had to do was hold down the power button for 20 seconds. It then restarted while I reconnected it to the receiver via the micro hdmi cable, the disconnected it. It's been working perfectly since.\n\nIt pained my heart that I possibly would have had to replace it and I would have still taken the chance and gotten another. There is no other tablet in my estimation that has the versatility of this tablet. Camera capability, camera flash, 8MP camera and many other features. This is a top notch tablet."}

Now I have on order an iPad Air - no more Android for me.\n\nOne additional item to consider when you invest this much in a tablet is the depreciation factor.  iPads hold their value far better and my Asus TF700T was selling for only about half of the original cost only one year removed from purchase.  Buy and IPad folks."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I had high hopes for this device.  And, to be fair, it might be less the device and more the ASUS updates that have been pushed down--but, given ASUS is behind them both, I believe this review is still valid.  I spent about $800 for both the tablet and the dockable keyboard about a year ago.\n\n1.)  The battery life is *terrible.* Especially after the past two updates, which is about the past 9-12 months.  I have both the battery in the tablet and the tablet dock, which has another battery, and from a full charge, it takes less than 18 hours to drain them both while in standby.  To state it another way:  From a full charge, and the WIFI setting set to turn off when unplugged (effectively disconnected from the internet), and the device in the \"off\" state (not shut down, but not active or in use) it drains both batteries in under 18 hours.  This is just not acceptable.\n\n2.)  Loading applications after a reboot, starting a browser session, accessing settings, sliding across screens is laggy, horrendously slow, jumpy, and buggy (applications crashing--or needing to be shut down).\n\n3.)  The system will randomly reboot.  (Akin to the blue screens of old WinOS days).  Once it crashes, it will try to reboot, but the OS will be quite buggy as though some remnant of the prior session is still active in memory.  SO, after a reboot, you need to go through the shutdown process all over again until you get a clean shut down.  This is problematic, because even though you choose \"shut down\" as the option to power off, the system will actually try to \"restart\" itself over and over again.  (This is why I think there is a remnant of something still active from the crashed session.)  Eventually, after at least three and as many as seven (based upon my experience) you'll get a clean shut down, and you can power up and be okay until the next crash.\n\nNOW, the logical expectation for me and my experience is to say, why haven't you done a factory reset--it sounds like something serious is wrong.  In fact, I have done four since getting the device in 2012.  Four times I have gone through the arduous task of backing up my files to the cloud, resetting the device, starting with a clean system, re-establishing all of my accounts and settings, and putting my data back on the device (if I want it back on).  Each time is a few hours to do the actual reset and a several days to get everything configured and set up again.  This isn't acceptable.\n\nTo be fair, I like the concept.  I like Asus technology in general.  I very much enjoy having a physical keyboard, which makes using a tablet as a primary device a possibility.  I think the resolution is amazing.  I like the concept of having an extra battery and extended life.  When the device was new (pre ASUS updates) it worked beautifully.  But, the device as it sits now, with current ASUS updates is undependable and if I had an option for a tablet with a physical keyboard (non bluetooth because they are in fact laggy and ridiculous to use), I would switch in a minute.\n\nI consider this a big miss for Asus, and I will definitely look at a different manufacturer when I'm ready to replace this one."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I have certain things I need a tablet to do and this one does them all.  I use it to browse the Internet, get & send emails, read books, read and edit MS Office documents, take notes, keep track of my contacts and calendar, watch movies, listen to music, remotely control other computers, take pictures and videos, and a few other things.\n\nLike most Android devices, it needed a few tweaks out of the box.  The stock browser was agonizingly slow: fixed by downloading a 3rd party free browser.  Had a few problems with the email app: downloaded AquaMail Pro (cost a couple of bucks).  K-9 Mail doesn't work well on the TF700T.  The speaker (one \"stereo\" speaker) is weak but works fine for everything but music & video, and I use speakers or headphones for both.\n\nOn the plus side, the TF700T is sleek, metal instead of plastic, and has a great looking screen.  The screen is made of Gorilla Glass so it should also be tough.  You can add a micro sd card and it has a micro HDMI port.  And, if you want a physical keyboard, the optional dock is excellent, with an additional battery, keyboard & touchpad, sd card reader, and usb port.\n\nI've read reviews here about the TF700T being slow, locking up, stuttering, etc.  I haven't experienced these things except for the stock browser.  This is my third tablet (iPad 2, Blackberry PlayBook) and I have no complaints.  To paraphrase another reviewer here, don't be afraid to buy this tablet.\n\nedit:  I changed my rating to 4 stars from 3.  I like this tablet and it occurred to me that a lot of people don't think 3 stars is a very good rating.\n\nUpdate:.\nI've had this tablet for a while now and use it every day, and I can see what what the negative reviewers are talking about.  It will occasionally slow down when checking for updates and has locked up a couple of times when on standby.  I'm an IT Consultant and working around these things is a minor inconvenience for me; I still like it.  If you're looking for your first tablet or aren't computer-savvy, get an iPad.  Less features and more expensive, but my wife (who fits in that category) loves hers."}

Hard to change when the IPad has done such a good job, but, it was time for an upgrade, without having to spend the high dollars demanded by Apple.  Not bashing Apple, but just looking for the best deal for my dollars.  The TF700 Transformer Tablet took a good 10 days to get used to.  I even thought about going back to the IPad, but stuck it out.  Now, I'm very happy with my new tablet.  I've been able to get pretty much every app that I enjoyed on the IPad, including a few I didn't know about that was available in the Google Play Store.  The tablet loads very quickly and is so easy to work with.  I also purchased the keyboard as it has made it easier to make notes, emails, and even make up documents.  There's no shortage of options to customize it to make it your own tablet.  I was initially disappointed with the factory \"play music\" app, but soon learned about the dozen's of free options through the play store, including apps that can transfer my music wirelessly from my ITunes to my TF700.  Using \"Shuttle\" app, it even sets up the same playlists that I had on my IPad.  I'm able to use Firefox as my browser, and new emails to my GMail account briefly show up in one corner to let me know instantly of mail received.  Now after 3 weeks, I'm very happy to have made the change.  Using the keyboard which has a USB port, I can easily transfer info, music, pictures, documents, and have already watched movies on the tablet.  I really like the IPad, but love the  this TF700 Transformer Tablet."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "Shame on you AS; I've been a big fan of your motherboards, laptops, and network equipment, but this tablet is horrible.  I was very excited last Christmas when I received this tablet as it had been reviewed so well and it seemed to have enough hardware to be able to compete with an iPad.  It seemed fairy snappy for a bit and then the problems started.\n\nBasic tasks like typing into the address bar of the web browser lags horribly.  Launching the Kindle app literally takes up to 15 seconds at times.  Multitasking is a joke as it can take up to 30 seconds to switch apps and it sometimes crashes and you have to wait another 15 seconds or so for it to update.\n\nI have done about five wipes of the device hoping that it speeds it up and there has been no difference.  Even when it comes factory reset it is only slightly faster than when you add your own apps.  The \"performance\" setting makes only a slight boost in speed.  The really frustrating thing is that this tablet flies when playing full screen games like Need For Speed but at the same time can't accept basic typing without choking.  My co-workers urged me to send it back to ASUS since it was still under warranty (which cost me $15 bucks with insurance) and they sent it back wiped and said the device didn't have any issues.\n\nI have never been a fan of how much Apple locks down their devices and you have to pay extra for everything that comes standard on the Infinity like and HDMI output and Mini SD card slot.  I hate to say it, but nothing I have used so far comes even close to an iPad 2 which is now three generations back.  I work with iPads everyday at work and it pains me that nobody can come up with an Android tablet that can come even close to an iPad.  I have heard good things about the Kindle Fire HDX and Nexus 7, but we'll have to see.\n\nIf I had known how slow this tablet was, I would have paid a little extra and purchased an iPad.  The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because it has a great screen and nice feel."}

The TF700 was fast and responsive until it started filling up, and three months out, it's so slow that it's turned into a svelte Amherst gray brick. When I do need to use the tablet, I have to wait about 10 minutes for the tablet to become usable. Whenever any app is updating in the background, the tablet is unusable. Whenever a background process is running (for instance, Gmail sync), the tablet is unusable. Whenever I type an email, the lag is so great that sometimes an entire sentence will appear several seconds after I typed it.\n\nI'm still waiting for Asus to provide an official update to the TF700 with Android 4.3, but that hasn't happened and I've lost patience. To save on costs, Asus used the cheapest, slowest storage it could find on the market, which is a bottleneck for the rest of the otherwise top-of-the-line tablet (Tegra 3, bright HD LCD, premium finish, etc). Android 4.3 brings TRIM support. TRIM is a routine that runs in the background to track used blocks on your computer's storage, so the unused blocks can be rewritten efficiently. So I could root this device, void the warranty, and use a ROM that's much faster, or wait until Asus gets around to updating this tablet to a version of Android that's already 6 months old."}

Other reviewers have stated that this is due to slow memory i/o speeds, and that this is partially fixable with a warranty-breaking, 3rd party firmware such as cyanogen or some kang. I don't have the energy to try this, as I believe recent Asus updates have locked down the bootloader pretty hard. Those same updates broke their bloatware weather widget, by the way. YouTube, web browsing with chrome or the android browser, and the tegra-3-optimized splashtop client all become unusably sluggish after minutes, or even seconds of use. The browser crashes entirely. YouTube can't play five minute videos without stopping to buffer. Guess what! We can watch the same videos flawlessly on my wife's six-year-old ultra-portable windows xp laptop. It has lower hardware specs all around, and it streams fine, at the same resolution! Splashtop is just a choppy mess. I don't understand why they say this is optimized. Optimized for what?\n\nI ignored the warnings about this device. Maybe it's some kind of situation where you'll be pleased with the device 9 times out of 10, and I got a bad one... but I don't think I'll ever buy another Asus tablet again.

The ASUS tablet has one small speaker on the back (2\"x1/4\") facing out with about 100 micro holes for the sound to pass through.  The only way to hear anything, is to cup your hand around the speaker to bounce back the sound. However, the ASUS tablet has an adjustable equalizer for music (the new Kindles don't have a manual equalizer anymore since going Dolby)...but the ASUS only sounds good with earphones or bluetooth speakers.  Do not buy this tablet expecting to use it without an enhanced listening device. It might as well not have a speaker at all.  And ASUS describes the tablet as having superior sound.\n\nEverything else about the tablet is good (for me) and performs well.  No lockups on websites that use Flash Player - and that's why I'm going to keep the ASUS tablet - it supports Adobe Flash Player.

Or it would respond, but not the way I wanted it to.  I would touch a link on the bottom of the screen and a link elsewhere on the screen would be activated.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "Like the title says...\n\nI've owned this device for a little over one year now, and I have to say, it's been a constant, consistent source of frustration. This thing is the opposite of being an absolute pleasure to use. I almost dread picking it up at this point, because I know there's a high probability using it will lead to me wanting to smash it (which I have almost done several times now). I truly hate this thing and wish I'd never bought it.\n\nThere are so many problems with it, but here's a relatively concise list:\n\n1. Terrible build quality: From day one, the screen cover was not well seated, the buttons feel soft and cheap (like they're going to stick), there's a strong amount of light bleed on the sides of the screen.\n\n2. Absolutely atrocious performance: Again from day one, the lag on this thing has been a pain in the behind. Given its hardware specs, it should have no problems whatsoever running apps, opening documents, switching from screen to screen in the UI, etc (although, how could they have put only 1GB of RAM in it?!?). However, this is nowhere near the case. It started off being absolutely unbearable to use. After a few months of owning it, I finally decided I had nothing to lose, and went ahead and rooted it and installed a custom OS (CROMi). This made the tablet much more bearable to use; but it's still super frustrating to use on a constant basis. There are still massive lags when opening up PDF documents, for example, or if there are more than a couple apps open at the same time. It's mind blowing how much I've had to do to this thing in way of mods, and even after that, it's still not as good as an iPad is out of the box (and trust me, I'm no Apple fanboy - I just like to use what works well and doesn't give me excessive headaches).\n\n3. Poor peripherals and design: The built in speaker is near useless, since it's so quiet you need to be in a totally quiet room to hear it. It doesn't help that it's in the back, so most of the sound is projected AWAY from the listener! The headphones jack is in the worst possible spot, such that it blocks your hand from resting comfortably on the device while holding it. I was able to get used to this eventually, but still. The proprietary charging/data transfer connection is poorly designed. The plug fits very loosely in it, and is easy to pull out. The same goes for the USB adapter, which rests very insecurely in it. And why not have a USB port built directly into it, instead of having to use an adaptor???\n\n4. Terrible battery life: The battery life in this things is a joke. Can't get through more than about 6 hours of normal use - maybe 10 with the keyboard dock.\n\nThere's only one positive thing I have to say about this device: The screen is very nice. It's nice and sharp and produces nice levels of saturation. However, even there, it's not ideal, since the color accuracy of the screen in not very good, and it tends to crush the blacks.\n\nThis has been my first experience with Android, and I have to say, I'm unimpressed so far. I'm about to give Android another try with a Galaxy Note 3, so we'll see how that goes...\n\nOverall, I would never recommend this tablet to ANYONE. Terrible product."}

But just taking a rebooted device and opening a browser can be quite slow as well.  I have looked all over for tweaks to improve performance, and while I have found some things that help somewhat, at the end of the day the tablet is still a pain to use.\n\nI have seen people suggest that the major problem with the thing is that it only has 1G of RAM, and that might well be the underlying problem. Unfortunately it isn't fixable - your only option is to discard the tablet and get a different one and hope that it performs well.\n\nThe problem for people trying the thing out in the store is that you are most likely only playing with a browser.  You won't have the facebook app running, and you won't have many other apps running.  Thus on the surface it might appear to be performing well."}

It has been rated up there with the Applie iPad but at half the price so since I am on social security, I opted for the one that cost the least.  I LOVE the tablet; HOWEVER, it is coming apart at the top next to the on/off switch and it causes the screen to freeze so that I can't do anything, not even turn it off.  I sent it to ASUS for repair three weeks ago and I have called customer support twice and had a 30  minute \"live chat\".  They all say they cannot let me talk to the warranty/repair department; they only communicate through email and they said they have tried to contact me through email but I haven't responded.  I have not received an email and I've checked it every day repeatedly, including spam.  All I've managed to get out of the \"support\" department is they were letting me know how much it will cost ME to repair it.  Since the case is cracked; they automatically assume it has been dropped and it is therefore considered \"CID\", customer induced damage.\n\nI keep my tablet in a leather case and carry it in a laptop bag and I have NEVER dropped it. Of course everyone will say that, so they won't believe me.  It is less than one year old. I am on social security and my tablet is my lifeline to the outside world. I can't afford to repair the tablet, let alone buy a new one.\n\nSo, I am very frustrated that you cannot TALK to the people in the warranty/repair department and that the \"support\" department does not have access to the analysis from the repair department or the email they supposedly sent me. So, the support person said they would \"escalate\" the repair and make sure they contact me ASAP. I said that is what they told me last week. So, who knows when I will get the phantom email, let alone get my tablet back unrepaired because I can't afford to fix it.\n\nI can't believe you cannot talk to someone in the warranty/repair department. That is absolutely ridiculous."}

I got it about 5 months ago for my dad's birthday and while he liked it the first couple times he used it, it didn't take long for the input lag to get so bad he refuses to even try it anymore.  The most serious issue I've found with it is that if you aren't using it every day, each time you go to use it you have to wait 20-40 minutes for it to download updates until it's done being bogged down.  It's just not usable during this time, which is not something I would expect with a quad-core or even dual-core processor.  If you've got plenty of time and patience on your hands, it works quite well once it's gotten through all of that.  Overall it's just really disappointing and given all the glowing reviews this thing had, it makes me wonder how tablets could be so popular in general if this is supposed to be one of the best."}

Received another RMA with \"apologies\" and promise that I will be reimbursed for shipping. When I received the unit back in late June/early July, not only was the problem worse right out of the box (touchscreen did not work at all!) they had scratched up the screen pretty good. It then took about a month of phone calls and phone calls not being returned like promised to get another RMA to send it in again. They replaced it this time, however the replacement has a faulty power switch (screen keeps coming on randomly and frequently, draining the battery quite well); and getting any wifi signal on it is quite the trick. So save yourself the time and money and go with another tablet."}

If you don't use it for a while, and the battery discharges (which it does even if you shut it down, by the way), then kiss it goodbye. Leave it for a week or two, and go back to it, and it'll be dead. You'll plug it in to charge it, you'll see the charging indicator go from orange to green...and it won't power on.\n\nWhen this happened to me the first time, I sent it back - I needed to get an RMA, and pay for shipping there (I overnighted it). They replaced the motherboard, and shipped it back (ground, of course, and signature required, which is oh-so-convenient for those of us who work 9-5). After I drove out to the \"local\" FedEx depot to pick it up, it worked great.\n\nUntil I let it go dead again. And so I charged it up again, last night. And yes, it doesn't power on.

It lasted 3 months and then just stopped working. I sent it in for repairs and it took ASUS about 4 weeks to process it and then they sent me a refurbished unit instead of a new one. It hasn't failed yet, but I doubt it will last long.\n\nBattery life is dismal. You really have to purchase the keyboard unit so you have another battery. By dismal, I mean several hours of use, and its time to recharge. With the keyboard attached, the batteries are good for 3-4 hours. The worst feature is that it runs hot. You have to use it in a case, because it gets very hot while it is being used for playing simple games (like Solitare and Ruzzle).\n\nReading e-books is challenging. The brightness of the display does not auto adjust as advertised and it basically is one level of bright which is like a beacon in the night.\n\nIt is not easy to learn the functions and settings compared to an Android phone, which puts it to shame.\n\nUpgrades are supposed to be automated but my camera firmware upgrade fails every time. Not clear on how to download and install a major upgrade and ASUS instructions online don't help.\n\nI would not purchase an ASUS again for any product. I would go with IPAD or Samsung.

My phone still has a slide out keyboard.\n\nI looked at different tablets with 2 goals in mind. First to replace a dead HP laptop.  Second to have a tablet for use as a mobile computer / e-reader / game playing / movie watching device.  Not having any Apple products, and not liking their \"new product every 30 days\" hype, I wanted an Android device to be able to pair it with a new phone when I got around to it.  Surface was just coming out and I never buy the first edition of anything but would rather give them time to get the bugs worked out.\n\nI like it.  It's heavier than an \"Air\" but that gives me a little more substance  which I find somewhat reassuring.  I like that I can slip it into a bag without the keyboard and use it as a tablet or add the keyboard and use it like a notebook.  I can use it  as an e-reader when stuck in some mentally terminal place like a Dr's office or on a trip.  Or use it for some mental and finger stimulation with offline games.  (I have never played Call of Duty or any of the other high action games so I don't know how it handles them.)\n\nThe word processing stinks.  It's functional but not something that I would use for serious \"office work\" and I have to extend that to the entire office suite preloaded.  Because it has Jelly Bean I cannot use Adobe.  But have found a reader that works well for pdfs (UB reader)\n\nHaving to manually reduce the running tasks to free up cpu is a pain.  If I'm not online why do I need YouTube and other internet tasks running in the background.  In time I will figure out how to keep them off until I WANT them.\n\nThe tablet keyboard has a big wide space bar but does not always register unless it is touched in or very near the center requiring that I go back and add spaces to \"runonwords.\"  It also is missing the \"up down left right\" arrows that make simple word adjustments in the body of a document easier.\n\nI LOVE  the clarity of the screen.  In anything but full sun that is.  The glass is too shiny and reflective then.\n\nIt does get warm as the battery both charges and while in use.  But not hot, just warm.\n\nYes, I bought an expensive \"starter\" tablet.  It reviewed well and I'm quite happy with my purchase.  I would recommend it to someone as a great crossover.  Tablet when you want it.  Decent sized notebook when you want that.\n\nAnd yes, I've found that being able to carry just the tablet or the tablet / docking station around is so much nicer than lugging the 17 inch laptop around.\n\nTablet, & Docking Station / Keyboard & Poetic case."}

Compared to Galaxy S3, this feels like a 5 year old device.\nPerhaps I might change my review once I get on installing a custom ROM to see any improvement.\n\nBesides these issues the other problems might be just my bad luck, since a friend brought it over from US to Korea, and the damage might have been happened during travel, or maybe not. A narrow spot on the bezel flexes, nothing very obvious. The other is that the dock wobbles when tablet is standing vertically, but no issues when it's just the keyboard, so I do not what the problem is, uneven tablet edge ?!

I don't know what they've done with their Android builds - but they have really messed up. I contacted Asus support multiple times - and after spending hours talking with the morons on their staff have just given up.\n\nThis is the last Asus product I'm buying. I hope this company and its second rate products fail spectacularly - and this is the last time I'm selecting an \"alternative\" manufacturer. In the future I'm sticking to the tried and tested companies.\n\nIn case you are contemplating buying the crap of this company I would suggest you reconsider."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I am using the 64 GB version of the tablet, with a 64 GB microSDXC card.  I have the keyboard dock and the Caseen folio case, which it is always in & connected to the dock.  I was happy to see that the microSD card slot supported SDXC cards, as I could not find that information online (eventually, I plan on putting a 128 GB SDXC card in the dock & this thing will be a monster!).  The screen is adequately bright, even at medium brightness, day & night.  I have not tried using it in direct sunlight, but inside my car all summer on break at work, or out on the patio during the middle of the day, I have had no problems reading the screen.  The colors & pictures are amazing.  The touchscreen is highly responsive & accurate.  It scores just a bit lower on the AnTuTu benchmark than my Samsung Galaxy Note II, which uses the same Tegra 3 processor, but I have seen reports that suggest that larger screens typically score lower, and it is not by a wide margin.  The Samsung seems a bit more responsive under heavy load - for example running app updates through Google Play store while also browsing on the web, or checking email, or even reading an ebook, there is occasionally a bit of lag, especially when switching from one task to another, but overall not too bad.  It is great that it is absolutely silent, and does not heat up appreciably.  I love being able to open the folio & have the screen turn on automatically & instantly and be able to resume exactly where I was.  The battery life is excellent - I used the tablet & dock for about 13 hours almost continuously on WiFi before it was completely drained.  I have not tried the bluetooth yet, not have I really tested the audio with music playback, but the few movie clips & webpages I have viewed looked/sounded great.  I turned the camera on once (just to make sure it worked), and the resolution on both cameras is what I would expect.  I find myself using this over my Netbook occasionally, although I do like the keyboard on my Netbook slightly better when typing long text blocks (like writing papers).  If I wasn't doing a graduate IT program, where I need access to Windows programs sometimes for classes, I might even use the docked tablet more often than the Netbook.  I am waiting for a microHDMI to regular HDMI adapter, and I will see how well the tablet interfaces with my Samsung tv.  I am planning on getting a USB OTG adapter as well, so I can connect the tablet directly to my external hard drive.  Maybe I will update in a month or so, after I have had a chance to put the tablet through its paces a bit more, and test some of the other features and connections."}

In fact I loved it so much I spent the same amount and bought my husband the exact same table with keyboard.  My sister who is a die hard Apple user bought the same setup.  She wanted it for business and planned to use her Ipad3 for everything else.  Now I feel bad for strongly supporting this product so quickly.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I have been a 'tolerant' fan of Asus's line of Transformer tablets.  I have had the TF101, TF201, and the TF700.  Of the 3, I really liked the TF201.  Now, the only drawback of the TF201 (aka: Transformer Prime) is that the Wifi issues were definitely apparent.  Unless you were literally 10 to 15 feet from the router, your Wifi experience would be sluggish.  Hence, I got the TF700.  Definitely a huge improvement.  In fact, once you get another tablet/computer with a higher resolution, it's almost unthinkable to go back.  Switching back and forth to my TF201 and TF700 was like switching from a standard definition TV (TF201)to a high definition TV (TF700).  The problem with the TF700, is Asus didn't bother to implement enough RAM to make up for the screen's demands as well as the user's potential to multitask.  Despite the TF700's superior screen to its predecessors, it was the most sluggish in regards to performance.  I even rooted and flashed the TF700 with a ROM that would \"fix all that\".  And the result was the same. My beautiful screen wielding TF700 went from a sluggishly performing tablet with all looks and no strength to back it up (again, perhaps more RAM would've helped in this matter). After so many cold boots, factory resets, mixing and matching with this ROM or that ROM, I noticed that Amazon was featuring a 2012 Nexus 10 (new, not refurbished) for the SAME PRICE as a new TF700.  After getting a Nexus 10 with none of the bloatware and straight untouched Jellybean, woah, what a difference.  And the screen resolution is top notch (for now) out of any 10+ inch tablet.  I sold my TF700 but kept my TF201 (despite the Wifi issues, it was the most reliable overall).  If you shop around Amazon, you'll notice that a Nexus 10 (2012 and new, 32gb version) costs just as much as a new Asus TF700. Why not avoid the bloatware and waiting game (yes, you'll be waiting on the next Android OTA update while Nexus devices such as the Nexus 4, 7, and 10 get it first)? If you want a superior screen without the lag and performance issues, I would avoid the TF700.  It's just too bad that something this great (a nice sized tablet with a dockable keyboard) would have so many issues in regards to performance.  My best description of the TF700 is that it's a 2012 Chevy Corvette with a 4-cylinder engine under the hood.  Meaning, it looks good, but the horsepower isn't enough to prevent the performance issues from being so obvious."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "Performance wise, this is an awesome tablet. It runs all of my development applications (and games) quickly and easily. The screen is clear and responds well to touch. I like that Asus has been so quick to update the software as needed, although sometimes the constant updates can be a bit of a hassle. (I went through a couple of updates while I was connected to airplane WIFI - not fun.) The cameras are high enough quality, although I don't take many pictures with this device. The battery life has been very good - approximately 4 to 5 hours depending on my use.\n\nMy favorite thing about this tablet is the connection to the full keyboard that is available separately. Used together, I have a complete mini laptop that will fit in my bag and is easy enough to carry around with me. When I use this and my remote desktop application, I have the freedom to use my home computer from anywhere I go.\n\nIf you are looking for a great tablet, this definitely should make your list. I'd also recommend the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1, with a bluetooth keyboard. Although neither of these tablets is \"budget\" priced, if you are a working professional, you won't find a better value."}

It happens.\nSo, after 1.5 months mine tablet stop charging. I sent it to ASUS repair center in Grapevine, TX. Repair time was OK and i thought that's is but it broke after 1 week again after I got it back. I though maybe was some mistake so I sent it again to repair center. This time repair time was faster. Once I got tablet back it broke again after 3-4 days with same problem - not charging.\nMaybe you will not believe but it broke 3rd time with same problem. Currently is on repair again.\nI was contacting ASUS so many time, and every time I had feeling that from other side is robot sending automated messages.\nThey didn't care, policy says exchange in first month and the rest of warranty period repairs. Obviously they can repair it.\nMost likely it will go like this till warranty expires and that's is. I will have broken tablet for 488 USD.\nBesides that ASUS is not what they advertise, tablet it self is exactly what was paid for it - Mid class but they advertise it as top class but they still need to learn a lot both technical and service sides.\nI highly not recommend ASUS any more to any body and for sure I'm over with ASUS product for life.\n\nIf anybody doesn't believe I will provide (to private address) all RMA numbers and correspondence even they put a note that it's illegal to publish and parts/information's from e-mails."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I'm a big android fan and was pretty excited to get my hands on this device. Unfortunately, my excitement was short lived once I actually started using it.\n\nThe tablet is nearly incapable of any kind of multitasking. If you happen to be surfing the web when an update for one of your apps comes through your browsing will slow to a complete crawl and there is a good chance of having the tablet freeze and/or crash on you completely. Apps will also 'hang' when launched so when you press a app you can expect to wait for a while till it decides to open the app (your device will freeze during this time) and even when launched it will just go to a black or white screen for even longer while the application loads. Sometimes the app will load, some times it will freeze and force you to do a hard restart...it's a complete crap shoot every time you decide to use the device.\n\nWhile the screen resolution is nice, you really aren't going to make use of it unless you are watching videos that have been completely downloaded onto an SD card or the internal hard drive. Video quality while streaming Netflix or Hulu is horrible and on par with my first generation Nook and it still runs into serious frame rate issues at less than 480p resolution. This isn't an Internet issue on my side as I have multiple devices in my house and ALL of them outperform this device for streaming video; even ones old enough that you can't buy them off the shelf anymore.\n\nI know not everyone who owns the TF700 has these issues, but Asus's QA is spotty at best so you are taking a complete gamble as to how well it will perform once you open the box. On a separate but related issue, the dock/keyboard for the tf700 also suffers from some serious QA issues. Hitting backspace will, 50% of the time, force close all programs and take you to the home screen or shut the device down completely. Simply writing a simple email can become the ultimate test in patience as you are going to need to start over at least twice trying to write more than a few paragraphs.\n\nI have to admit that the device looks gorgeous but as I'm not in the market for overpriced paper weights I can't really weigh this as a positive.\n\nI seriously considered benchmarking this device to see what was really going on as I am fairly sure the factory they have putting these together in China is supplementing the parts it's suppose to have with cheaper, outdated parts that cause it to perform so poorly. Ultimately I decided it was better to just package it up and return it to Amazon and warn other potential buyers what they may be up against."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I originally bought this Tablet and Keyboard dock last November (2012), and then bought my wife an identical setup 1 month later.  The TF700 boasts great specs on paper, but using it will eventually make you want to drink drain-o.\n\nPROs: Pretty HD screen.  RMAs get sent/returned very fast.\n\nCONs:  Everything else.  You ever had one of those bad dreams where you're running away from a bad guy and it feels like you can barely move; like you're running in slow motion?  That's what using the TF700 is like.  Everything is laggy.  The tablet is constantly trying to catch up with your inputs.  That includes when typing, especially when web browsing(I've tried Chrome, Opera, Firefox, and the default browser).  Some of them suck slightly less on this thing than others, but it is always a frustrating slow experience.  Like many of the others on here, I prayed and prayed that the JB firmware updates would liberate this thing's performance.  That hasn't happened yet, so either Asus' programmers really suck at buidling their version of the Android updates or this thing just doesn't have the speed.\n\nNo joke, it is actually slightly faster for me to do the same tasks, games and web browsing on my first-generation Kindle Fire than using the TF700.  My wife's Samsung Galaxy S3 blows the doors off this thing, and its a PHONE.\n\nMy TF700 also suffers from chronic lock-ups and reboots out of the blue. I just got it back from RMA yesterday (not rebooting anymore) but the touch interface is now screwed up.  My understanding is the NAND memory in these things is really slow, and that's what causes the problem.  The solution I'm told is to root your device (voids the warranty) to bypass that memory\n\nI've had to RMA BOTH my TF700 and my wife's in the last 5 months; and mine's going back again tomorrow.  My wife's is the same amount of laggy, but it also stopped charging after about 2 months of use.  They replaced the MOBO and its back to its normal laggy self.\n\nMine (for several months) rebooted and crashed constantly even after factory resets.  The keyboard then stopped charging and working, so I RMA'd both.  The keyboard now works, but the TF700 touch screen action is all glitchy.  I have to tap on the same icon 4-5 times to get it to do anything.  Its almost like the system is locking up very briefly every few seconds as I'm using the touch screen.\n\nI don't know what's wrong with it now... I just know I'll NEVER EVER EVER buy another Asus Tablet again.  I wish I'd gone with the Galaxy Note 2 or something else.  This thing SUCKS and is expensive for something that's slower than Amazon's first generation KF."}

Based on some of the positive reviews, obviously I received a lemon and given that Asus could not repair it properly, I expected them to replace it since it is still under warranty. However, after spending forty minutes on the phone with them, they said I would have to send it in again and they would \"take another look at it\".\n\nAsus Customer Service is the absolute worst I have ever dealt with so be prepared for that if you buy one of their products.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "The Asus TF700 is exactly what a premium tablet should look and feel like.  When you hold it in your hand it just screams quality.  The lines are clean and there is no flex in the tablet at all.  The screen is bright and colors are true to life with very little saturation or contrast issues.  While it doesn't have as high a DPI as the Nexus 10, I much prefer the display on the TF700.  I love how bright it gets and if you watch a lot of movies/tv shows on it - like I do - then you'll appreciate how beautiful this screen is.\n\nOther Pro's are the keyboard dock which adds battery life and a bunch of extra functionality.  It really feels like a potential laptop replacement (though you'll want to use a regular laptop for heavy lifting of course).  Throw in not one but TWO SD card slots (one micro-sd on the tablet and regular SD on the dock) and you have the potential for a ton of extra storage. If you have a lot of multimedia content there really is no better set up than this.  With the micro-hdmi port you can pipe beautiful HD video to your big screen TV without a problem. I've done this countless times and have been pretty pleased.\n\nWith so much to love why would I give this tablet 2 stars?  Simple: usability.  While the tablet is a year old it should not have the lag problems that it does.  It has a Tegra 3 with 1 GB RAM.  More than enough to run multiple apps without a problem.  On Paper!  If you're like me you get frustrated when your phone or computer just sits there seemingly doing nothing while you wait for it to load an app.  Well, get ready to feel that way a lot!  Want to use your tablet while apps are updating in the background?  Good luck!  I was away from wifi for a few days and went to use my tablet today.  10 apps were updating and the tablet was unusable.  At one point I just put it down and Instead reached for my laptop and smartphone.\n\nAt this point I'm going back to the Nexus 10.  While I will miss the keyboard dock, better build quality, and nicer HD screen  I will not miss that feeling of utter frustration I feel using the TF700.\n\nYou have been warned."}

N is the fastest and most reliable of these protocols.  In several tests, I have determined that my tablet works fine on B and G networks but will not access the internet at all on an N network.

I did finally find a GumDrop case which is great but it took a lot of digging to find it.\n4) Slow to start-up.\n\nPros:\n1) Crisp clear display\n2) Responsive touch controls, even with screen skin\n3) Useful outlets\n4) Good camera resolution and placement\n\nIf I had not had an issue, could get an Otterbox, and it would work on 802.11N, It would give it a resounding 5.  As is, only a little above average tablet, with a very high price."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I purchased the 64gig tft700 asus transformer tablet about 8 months ago. Initially I loved it. It was blazing fast with a beautiful screen and all the memory in the world. Since then I have had to factory reset it twice and am now going to have to do so again. Gradually it starts locking up once every day or two, then every day and then every few hours, Then it will boot but lock up within a couple seconds of starting. Cold booting it helps for a while but then no longer works. At that point it is a paper weight waiting to happen unless you factory wipe it. I have applied all the over the air updates that Asus has pushed out and it just hasn't changed the behaviour. I actually don't really push this thing at all, I just use it daily as an e-reader using the kindle app. I had thought that maybe it was a problem with the kindle app but even if you don't start that app it will lock up. I am seriously regretting purchasing this thing over a sumsung. I like the idea of the docking station keyboard with extra battery power and that does work well when the unit is working. However it has let me down time after time after time till I want to throw it through a wall. Other than it won't run stably it is all that they crack it up to be. Oh one other warning.. the latching mechanism on the keyboard breaks really easily. You can still put the tablet in the keyboard but it won't lock, this happened in the first week of owning it. Keyboard still functions fine after 8 months when the unit is working.\n\nI am an IT professional and have used many other android devices (tablets and phones) over the last few years and never had this many issues with one. I have even hacked a nook color to put standard android on it and have not had this much trouble. At this point, as I am stuck with this thing, I have thought about wiping and putting linux or a stock android flavor on it rather than asus's version on it and see if it will do better.\n\nI do not recommend that anyone purchase this. I have not contacted asus to trouble shoot it as I have followed a lot of the forums for people that have, and I have already done all that they recommended those people do. Maybe if I feel like going through hours and days of asus support agony one day I will but I am in such a foul temper over this thing that I don't think I could not bite the head off of the first person that told me to factory reset the unit to continue the support process, after I told them I had done so twice and had the same symptoms show up both times in the past.\n\nSo after spending 800 dollars on this and the keyboard and 8 months of frustration take my warning and run far and fast.\n\nScott"}

Unfortunately I cannot take advantage of some of my Prime membership benefits, such as, being able to borrow books, or watching some of my bought and owned HD movies on it, hopefully Amazon will rectify some of these problems.

I noticed while I was resetting it, that the reason it may have been so slow is because I may have set it to encrypt the device. I could be wrong, but either way I did not enable encryption and it's faster now.

Android does work for me. Variety, control, flexibility of OS. I want to interact with and be able to change what's going on with my tablet as opposed to just turning it on and using what's set up or me by someone somewhere else  Enter the Asus TF201 and Android . Issues with wifi, GPS,video player support, lagging ram. In spite of those issues, still a nice tablet, great looking display,functional, great keyboard, all in all, a good tablet once you get done with the hard resetting,cold booting, and figuring out the work arounds. Which I didn't mind doing because it became a challenge, and I like challenges. And I am not a technical person.\n\nNow comes the TF700. Outstanding display,good wifi, good gps, TF 201 keyboard works with it. Bought it refurbished from Amazon for 379.00. A good deal by any standard. I love this tablet. It is actually hard to put down. the display is better than or equal to the ipad display and you can actually do multiple tasks at the same time(Not so with ipad). The keyboard attached makes it look like a small laptop. Insert a 32GB sd card and you have a small laptop with more space than most people are going to use this for. Posts on Transformer forums state that they are running the TF700 with 64 and 128GB sd cards. I will try that later.\n\nSo what's the point? This tablet is a lot of fun, great display, multi functional, Looks great but has some performance issues that require continued involvement on your part.  I have had this TF700 for over a month now. No epic fails as yet. However, it requires regular cold boots after app installs, frequent cache clean outs, assessments after app installs to see if the app is a problem, and resets for smooth running. You are going to need a support community to help with issues(trust me). But, this is a nice tablet if you are willing to put in the work. The rewards are worth it(I think). It does more than play chopsticks(Ipod analogy). I'm not sure about the stars. You figure it out on your own.\n\nHarley Davidson(Asus TF700) vs Suzuki(Ipod analogy). Two bikers are talking about their motorcycles. The Harley guy is talking about fixing this and that on his bike. The Suzuki guy says I would rather ride my bike than fix it. The TF700 is a great bike and does things that a Suzuki(ipod) can't do but requires routine maint. You decide what works for you."}

I bought a mount for my truck and took it on trips using the GPS and it took pretty good photos in a pinch.

The overall performance is very good and with combination with the keyboard dock, it has killing battery power and can pose as a netbook. But we have some little issues. The system is ok, Android 4.2 is fantastic and the Asus intrusion in the looks is minimal, although we have a bunch of crapware that are unnecessary, but can be useful. The only thing that annoyed me is the fact that the tablet takes some minutes to get a good  performance after waking up from the stand by. In this time, it responds irritantly slow. I don't know if the fault is of the Asus Android version or the Nvidia Tegra Processor. After this, the performance is very good! The screen is very good, indoor or outdoor. I like to watch some series or movies on Netflix in bed, before sleeping, and the quality is superb. The sound is ok, but it could be better. Battery life is ok, I can take around 9 hours of intense use; with the dock attached, this jumps to 13 hours.

Upgrade to the OS have been effortless.  Some of the functions are just different enough from my Android phone (LG Nitro) to take a bit of getting used to but they're not illogical, just different.\n\nThis is a constantly moving and improving market, of course.  But at the time of purchase, this was about as nice a tablet as you could get and now, a few months later, it continues to meet my needs very nicely.  I use it primarily for music-related activities, displaying lyrics and chords for guitar, playing back music, etc.  None of those activities are video intensive.  But when I've used it to view videos in high def, it performs like a champ and looks really good.  I'm very pleased.\n\nPerhaps the best thing I can say about the tablet is that it's largely \"transparent.\"  By that, I mean that I just do what I want to do with it and don't have to struggle with a clumsy interface.

Then i wiped the drive and started over after asus suggested it. I lost  some files did not reinstall some suspect apps. Nothing helped it was slow finicky and a pain to use. I waited patiently as every time i turned it on it had 15-30 updates. over time this has become worse i also lost the one reason i wanted it swipe typing was available then it was gone flash was available then it was gone.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "This is my first tablet.  First, why I bought this.  I wanted a tablet to use ad hoc around the house.  Especially when watching TV something would come up that I would like to get more information about.  For the first time I don't have to get up and walk to my desktop PC and I'm not limited by the tiny browser screen on my smartphone.  Using that tiny screen was really irking me.  Now after 3 months I'm very happy that the tablet has exactly met my objectives.  I use the tablet on many occasions while watching TV or just sitting around drinking coffee or sharing some information while sitting in the living room with friends.\n\nI narrowed my choices to the Samsung Galaxy TAB, Nexus and ASUS.  So why this particular tablet?  First I decided I wanted a 10\" screen.  After several trips to retailers comparing the 7\" & 10\" I decided the 10\" was the more usable screen size.  I am completely happy with that decision.  I think the size is a sweet spot for displaying enough information on the screen without needing to scroll while also displaying text and graphical content in a size that doesn't cause eye strain.  The tie breaker for choosing this tablet was the wide screen format to accommodate wide screen HD video plus the favorable reviews about the color quality, clarity and brilliance.  This tablet met or exceeded all my expectations for these features.\n\nMy second choice was the Nexus because of the very positive image and color quality reviews but it was much more expensive than the ASUS.  The Galaxy TAB seemed most comparable in price and features but the wide screen format of the ASUS was the tie breaker for me - even though I deliberated on the final choice because of negative comments about the speakers.  (More comments about this follow.)\n\nAnother reason for choosing this tablet over others was the keyboard dock and particularly the ability to close it up like a laptop.  I also like others' favorable reviews about USB ports and keyboard feel.  I haven't bought the keyboard yet.\n\nI don't have any issues about performance.  But I'm not a power user and I'm not using any apps that are processor intensive.\n\nNow for the one feature I'm really disappointed and annoyed about.  The speaker.  Its placement at the back of the tablet and the inability to raise the volume enough makes some content almost impossible to hear.  I was fully aware of negative reviews about this but I decided to buy it anyway because 1) many positives outweighed this one negative and 2) I didn't feel I would be listening to audio so frequently to become a major issue.  My feeling after 3 months of use is I can live with it, reluctantly.  As others have said, I frequently cup my hand around the speaker to project the sound.  On other occasions I have used a speaker dock that I originally bought for my smartphone.  But I would still like to say to the ASUS engineers, \"You did such a great job on the rest of the tablet, couldn't you figure out a way to make the sound better??\"."}

The screen is bright and the tablet is pretty easy to use.  The wife loves playing her games on this.  We got the keyboard and we really like that feature too.  Great battery life!"}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I really like the tablet, but it is by no means a laptop replacement. The web browsing is horrificly slow in most cases, especially on the stock browser. I use Chrome now and it works well enough. I also have the dock and it is nice but I don't think it will hold up very well. It doesn't seem to hold the tablet in place well any more and the casing pops like it is coming apart. The tablet however is very solid and the screen does not scratch easy. The screen is phenomenal and very bright! Works great for watching HD videos, streaming or on my micro SD card. Now that I have a GS4 I hardly use this unless I am using the Wi Fi Go app from my desktop PC which works very very well on this tablet.\n\nMy favorite part is the battery life. I leave it on constantly so it's always ready and only use it here and there, but I only have to charge it about every couple of weeks. Even when I do use it for some serious gaming, it still lasts 6-8 hours with just the tablet and easily 10-12 with the dock!\n\nNow that it has gone down in price for a refurb and the software is better I would recommend this to anyone looking for an android tablet. However it is not a windows laptop replacement, and it does not support FLASH AT ALL!!! That goes for all jelly bean and later android devices, but is still disappointing.  I would recommend this if you are looking for a tablet to travel with, as it has long battery life and easily connects to hot spots and works well in airports. Any new high end android phone is faster and more useful though so up to you I suppose!"}

I wanted something I could still do work on and play games on at the same time. I am currently awaiting the return of my tablet from the service center as it has a power issue. I was playing a game and the tablet shut off and would not turn back on. Other than that this tablet has been exactly what I wanted. It has Polaris Office so you can read and edit office documents. You can read PDFs and even wireless print from it with the help of a printer app. Even with the problem the processor in this thing is just awesome! Hopefully they will utilize the processor more and create some awesome tegra 4 games. This is lightweight and slim. I bought a gumdrop case to protect it because I have a four year old who is grabby."}

That is when I had my first issue.  This is referring to the keyboard, which is a separate product, but it highlights the issue with their customer support.  The rubber feet began randomly falling off of the keyboard.  I contacted customer support and they wanted me to actually send the keyboard into the service department to deal with this.  That's right they wanted to spend $20-$30 in combined shipping to take care of a few $.10 rubber feet.  I eventually got to someone reasonable who said they would send replacement feet.  Fortunately, I found the missing feet in my bag, but their solution to the problem was \"glue them back on\".\n\nNot long after that, I started having issues with the system itself.  The touch capabilities started failing and the system began acting erratically.  I went through all of the usual Android steps... updates... factory reset... and finally needed to send it in for repair.  When I sent it in, the techs \"tested\" it, decided there was nothing wrong, and sent it back with another factory reset.  I got it, reloaded everything, proceeded to use it and the problems were still there.  Now they are making me send it back AGAIN.\n\nIt gets 2-stars, because, when it works, it's a great system, but only 2-stars because their customer and technical support is AWFUL."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I was looking forward to this device, and was heartily disappointed by it.  I sold my iPad 1 for it, then sold this to a co-worker and replaced it with an ipad 3...which I traded in for my Surface Pro (and now I've never been happier now that I have the Surface Pro).  After I give some background, I'll bullet my concerns, just to save you voluminous reading.\n\n  I'm a tech guy, so I have a fairly regular 18 month refresh cycle on my laptop and 2.5 rolling part-at-a-time refresh for my desktop.  I swap phones on a whim to try out new capabilities.  My tech goal though, is optimizing for travel:  I fly ouvr 50,000 miles a year.  With the amount of time that I spend on planes and in hotel rooms, I'm constantly looking for the 'best solution for the road'.  This wasn't it.  Some of the reasons why surprised me, and I wouldn't have expected them until I faced them.\n\n*  The removable keyboard is a pain in the butt on the fly.  If you are flying, you need to find somewhere to stash the keyboard if you remove it, and in a place that you can access it without bugging your neighbor.  It usually ended up jammed between the cushion and the armrest.\n\n*Removing the keyboard was generally a 'pull it off at an angle' endeavor, which is a little awkward with limited arm room, such as in a plane.\n\n*The screen...holy fingerprint magnet!  I have never owned a device before or since that attracted so many fingerprints.\n\n*HD-out:  I'm not sure why, but it didn't work quite right all the time.\n\n*Interface lag:  there was noticible input lag when swiping and scrolling.  This is not an issue with either the ipad or the Surface Pro.\n\n*Crashing:  I have crashed every device I have owned I think, so I guess I shouldn't have been surprised.\n\n*Movies overseas:  I purchased and downloaded three movies before going overseas.  In the course of trying to watch them, something in the viewer 'phoned home' and told my machine that I could no longer watch them because I was overseas.  I spent 15 minutes on hold at $2.50 a minute to find out that it's an implementation issue with Google Play, and that I could have my $4 back.  This is not an issue with the iPad or Surface Pro.\n\n*Device support:  It \"sort of\" supported some of the peripherals, such as common game controllers, that could be hooked up to it.  I could hack around it, but that was sub-optimal.\n\n*The media player functionality didn't always work.  It wasn't always broken either, which was almost more frustrating.\n\n*Almost too small and slippery.  Because it was thin and stainless steel, I was constantly worried about it flying out of my hand if toted vertically.\n\n*Office productivity suite was disappointing.  This is a personal preference issue, but the iWork suite was much better suited to tablets, and the Office experience on the Surface Pro just kicks everything else to the curb.\n\n*My timecard with my company didn't render right in the browser.  Ever.  Not being able to do my timecard on the road was the final straw.  The ipad couldn't either, but I dug my old laptop out for a while.  The Surface Pro renders just fine, so it (and my cell phone) are my only electronic travel companions now.\n\n  Finally, if you're an Android fan, you're probably so used to the little software and OS nits that bug the crap out of me about Android.  I know people love it...but it reminds me of Linux:  \"It works awesome, as long as you just do this, and this, and this, and this...\"  Apple products on the other hand, offer a polished experience with a limited productivity experience.  The Surface Pro offers a good travel-productivity experience, with a battery life that is on par with the comparably sized Macbook Air (only about 4-5 hours)--but it offers full PC capabilities in addition to tablet capabilities...which is why I stayed with that."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "So let me begin by saying I have owned 1 (Count 'em ONE) Apple device apart from iPods in my entire life. That was an iPhone 3GS and I returned it after a week. I bought an Android phone right afterwards and haven't looked back.\n\nI am on my 6th Android smartphone now. I have a Galaxy S4. I also owned a Nexus 7 (Also made by ASUS) right before this. That was my first Android tablet, and I was very happy with it. I just wanted a bigger screen.\n\nBUT THIS TABLET IS NOT WHAT ANDROID IS MEANT TO BE.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the hardware is phenomenal. It's extremely thin, Micro SD card slot is a major plus (so is 32GB of storage though) The tablet itself is beautiful. As well as the screen. The cameras on the front and back are great and I didn't expect anything more  or less from them.\n\nBut the fact that it only has 1GB of RAM is this thing's downfall. It's downright pathetic that a QUAD CORE 1.6GHz TEGRA 3 PROCESSOR can't handle the ANDROID HOME SCREEN!!\n\nI installed CleanROM which is 100% de-bloated from all the crapware ASUS installs and it even overclocks the damn thing to 1.9GHz. YET IT STILL LAGS.\n\nI don't understand how a manufacturer can sell something like this when all it does is slow down and freeze after opening 3 apps. I've always trusted ASUS, but after this issue, and the fact that both this tablet and the Nexus 7 both had screen separation problems until I returned them the first time; I'm not as convinced as I used to be.\n\nSorry ASUS, but if I spent $430 on a tablet, I expect a flawless device, and if not a flawless device, then at least a slightly diminished hardware experience in exchange for a flawless software experience.\n\nRETURNED.\n\nI have been seriously considering an iPad since purchasing this product, just because I have lost all faith in large android tablets (this was supposed to be the best on the market). I thought about a Nexus 10, but I'm afraid that Android just isn't ready to handle large displays yet. (Even though my 1080p Galaxy S4 runs like a dream.)\n\nConsider this Android Phanboy, disappointed :("}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "After liking our Android phones decided to toss my wife's windows laptop and replace with the tablet. While for use almost exclusively networked to the home pc, I really liked the improvement in features the tablet represented: smaller, lighter, touch screen, cool apps, etc. I also liked the idea of taking it on the road when traveling, just a lot more portable. And while I really liked the tablet itself, when it came to Android and home networking, I decided this platform simply wasn't for me.\n\nTablet Pros:\n Touch screen - very bright and clear, smudges when screen off are completely invisible when on. Responsiveness is incredible.\n Battery - unbelievable standby time, very good use time. We didn't use that much, but left on all the time only had to charge every few days or so, maybe every other day with moderate use.\n Keyboard Dock - I also got the keyboard dock, worked really well, love the convertibility of it - the Android keyboard works amazingly well, but for more robust typing, the keyboard is obviously your best choice\n I really didn't use any other features but liked the idea of having both the forward and rear facing cameras, as well as the mini-HDMI port among others\n\nTablet Cons (only one):\n WiFi Speed - while at times I experienced speeds comparable to my laptop, at other times, this thing was incredibly slow, especially when watching video such as Youtube or a product video on a company website.\n\nAndroid Home Networking Cons - The Deal Killer in my book\n File Sharing - requires an app, such as the most popular, ES-File Explorer, all of which function essentially as FTP, meaning that you don't edit the file in place but instead open it, edit it, save it to the tablet, then transfer it back to the PC. Call me Goldilocks but I want to open it, edit it, save it, done. Okay, so \"duh,\" we're talking two completely different O/S's, so I should expect that, but I seriously thought the apps would handle it differently.\n Printer Sharing - again, requires an app. No, you don't just print directly from an Office type of software, or directly from a web page, but instead you save your file to the tablet, then open your downloaded printer app, then open the file, then print it. What a pain.\n\nConclusion:\nSo again, if you're looking for a mobile tablet or are all about cloud file storage, not considering it for networking with a pc, and are also only an occasional printer, then I would highly recommend this tablet. Otherwise, stick with Windows."}

The beautiful HD screen is amazing. The difference between my old tablet is like night and day. The response using the touch screen keyboard is faster as well. Especially since I tend to type a LOT using it. The Moko rotatory detachable cover and case is a MUST if you get it for not only does it rotate but, it seperates and becomes a case that you can slide your hand through and hold onto the tablet. It also does a great job at protecting the screen. Now, the kinda bad and the TERRIBLE about the tablet. It only has one speaker! Not a huge deal but, my Thrive had two and its not near the quality of this one. The BIGGEST fault, and this may not even be Asus' fault but, they should let people know.

Questions posted there usually get answers within 5 minutes and the people are very friendly.\n\nSide load Flash before you upgrade [I think that's still possible] and use flash with the Dolphin browser.  Chrome browser is very very fast on this tablet, but Chrome does not support flash on mobile..\n\nThis is now a fantastic price.  Don't be afraid to ask questions in the Transformer Forums.  That's where everybody starts.  If you plan on having this tablet for some time I would get this one; the 64gb version.  I have it and also have a 32gb removable micro SD card in it for a total of 96gb storage, plus the versatility of changing out the micro SD an unlimited number if times.\n\nLove it Love it Love it!"}

I got both a month or so after the TF700 came out when expectations were sky high, so I expected the tablet to be flawless and its just not. I heard the horror stories of people getting increadibly flawed products and having fits contacting customer service. I haven't had problems to that extent, obviously, but there still are some issues. Occasionally, I have seen a black bar flicker across the screen, which occours in both vertical and horizontal orientation. To date no update has fixed this, allthough I haven't personally noticed it in at least a week. Other than that, the tablet is kind of slow and laggy, whether that be opening apps, typing on the keyboard, or changing screen orientation.\n\nI bought this tablet since I'm a teacher and don't have a computer in either my classroom or office (don't even get me started on that), so I use my tablet and keyboard for responding to emails, presenting lessons, and letting students practice educational games on it like typing games, recognizing emotons, and telling time (I'm a special ed teacher so that works a lot better than worksheets and the like). It was billed as an iPad alternative and I believe it is in some aspects (like versitility and typing/ using office applications) but not in others (responsitivity and app selection, spesifically apps built for tablets). The rest of our school staff got Ipads and I'm not jelous at all, allthough I don't think I would buy this particular tablet again, especially at the price point of the tablet and the keyboard. That said, I'm pretty content with what I have"}

The 32GB of built in memory with an SD slot gives you all the memory you need at a faction of the cost of most 64GB tablets. Even though it doesn't use a standard USB charging system, the proprietary one charges really quickly.\n\nThe downside is that the battery life will get you over 9 hours of watching movies, but if you are just using it switching back between apps and games, you see a big drop off. (Although the docking station would resolve this.) Also because of the higher resolution, there are a fair number of apps that aren't available in the app store because it doesn't support this resolution.\n\nAll in all, this is a fantastic tablet and would highly recommend it.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I didn't find much difference between my new TF700 and the TF300. My personal benchmark which I found most effective in representing true daily use speed is the Play Store application updates. The sequence of download/install gives a good idea of how fast the device can be. My Nexus 4 is much faster (but it has phone issues which can be solved mostly by leaving it in 2G). Yet, about the only difference in specs is that the Nexus has 2GB of RAM and the tablet only 1GB.\n\nSo, the performance between the two is about the same. No significant improvement. However the TF700 has an improved GPS (it works as it should) and improved Wi-Fi. As for the higher resolution screen, well, if you have great vision, maybe you can tell the difference between 240dpi and 150dpi, but if your screen is full of finger marks, or if you had to put a non-glare screen protector on it, then I bet you can't tell the difference anymore. So there is much hype placed on screen resolution, none of which makes any difference really.\n\nIf it wasn't for the keyboard, I would have bought the: CUBE U30GT2 II Quad Core 10.1 inch Retina Screen Android 4.1 Tablet PC RK3188 2GB/32GB for $290\n\n[...]\n\nIn my view, it deserved a try.

I don't know if there is anyways to relock it so that ASUS won't be able to tell that it was unlocked either.\n\nSo basically if you buy this, plan of giving up any warranty support almost immediately if you want it to be very useful.\n\nI'm returning mine rather than messing with flashing it. It's not hard to do, but it just doesn't seem worth keeping a product that manufacturer isn't willing to make work properly.

Do not use this review as the instructions to do the unlock/rom install, there are better instructions.\n\nIf you're not willing to do this then I can't recommend it. Get the Note 10.1 or Nexus 10, even if they are a little bit more money.  Or, buy it and be prepared to return it within a short time if your browser thinks it's from 1997.\n\nThis thing was decent when I first got it.  Then the first update came and slowed down the browser to a very frustrating pace.  Like the worst computer you've ever used. Like an Ipad 1 which is what I had bought this to replace. The second update came and it was no better, maybe slightly worse.  There is something wrong with either the latest versions of Android or the lack of ram in this machine or Asus' ability to create their own ROM.  My 2GB Samsung Note 2 blows it out of the water in wifi or LTE. Samsung knows how to fix stock Android.\n\nI was really about to chalk this purchase up to a bad decision and just retire it after less than 2 months.  I couldn't in good conscience sell it to someone else.  If it was a horse I'd have to have shot it!  Then I figured I'm going to stop using it anyway, might as well try one of the \"mods\" that are all over the internet, especially xda developers site.  So I spent an evening reading about how to do it and the next day spent an hour doing it.  There is simple software available where you just choose some options and it magically does it.\n\nFirst I \"unlocked\" the bootloader, did not select root though it may have done that anyway, then did a backup, then installed the ROM (Cleanrom Inheritance) which is a slimmed down version of the actual Asus ROM.  I got to pick and choose default apps as well as the ability to add some additional ones during the install.  The additional ones are things like different home screens like Nova, ADW, etc, as well as different file managers, etc. Make sure you download browser2ram also and run it after install.  Quite a bit of good stuff.  Then I pressed install. I also chose to clear cache.  I recommend clearing ALL cache options because...\n\nThen came time to reboot. Then I waited.  And waited. And started freaking out that I may have \"bricked\" it.  It wouldn't get past the Asus spinning wheel.  Give it 15 mins. Googled it and found out that if I got this far, it wasn't bricked. Yippee.  If it doesn't work, hold the power button down until it shuts down, go back into the bootloader (hold volume down and power until the 3 icons come back up). Then clear ALL cache (3 buttons I think) and reboot normally again. Seems like after a time or two doing this it came up just fine as if it was a new tablet asking me to log into my Google account.\n\nGuess what?  It was a completely different tablet.  Now it works like it should.  The browser is fast, maybe not quite as fast as my Note 2 but then again my Note 2 has 2GB ram. I never get close to 1gb of ram used (sits about 6-700mb), so not sure if the Samsung is just faster or better. Could also be the lower resolution and screen size of the Note 2 vs the 1080p screen.  It's just fine now though, not the frustrating machine that gave me the worst post-purchase dissonance I've had in quite some time.\n\nIn the future if desired, I'll no longer get over the air updates (fact of life if you unlock the bootloader).  Thank GOD (and Asus) for that! I'll take these xda updates or simply leave it as it is forever (3 years it will probably be long in the tooth anyway).\n\nLuck.."}

It still lags a lot and feels really sluggish, but it is perfectly usable for most tasks. Lowering one extra star because of the lag. Yet I feel it is aging well, KitKat's Memory optimizations and Jellybean's TRIM have helped the NAND performance. It should be enough to last me rest of this device's productive life. But I look at my old iPad 2 and I lament the wasted chance this product entails.\nPlease ASUS, if you are reading this: never again cripple a product with such subpar components. For the next generation I WILL NOT be an early adopter for you.\n\n***Review Start - Minor modifications on 26/12/2013/***\nIf you are still waiting for the Android Tablet Messiah, this is not it.\n\nI bought this tablet back in October 2012, just after it finally went on sale, and immediately had buyer's remorse. The OS felt jerky and unresponsive, even with the Performance settings on. Turns out this tablet's flash memory is so sluggish that it drags down all the crazy performance of the Tegra 3 processor. So angry I was with this turn of events I installed Cyanogenmod 10.1 and slowly saw as performance improved. Now, in April, Asus has released a new update which appears to finally have optimized the OS and gave it the performance it lacked at first. I have tested the new Cyanogenmod version which includes the new optimizations Asus made and the difference is surprising. ***EDIT: Turns out the performance degraded after a while. It it perfectly usable, but not best-in-class***\n\nNow for the good: The rest of the hardware. The screen is a gorgeous slab of Gorilla Glass, amazing resolution and great colors. Love the aluminum body, and the dock keyboard is useful. The best feature, however, is it's unlockable bootloader, thanks to whom you can install any number of Android distributions. I installed Cyanogenmod 10.1 and haven't ever looked back. Asus' version of android is however very workable by itself, compared to Samsung's Touchwiz UI. It is very vanilla, has several minor improvements and comes preloaded with several good apps, specially the Polaris Office.\n\nThe Good:\n* Gorgeous screen\n* MicroSD slot\n* Asus's OS is vanilla android with several (good) optimizations and preloaded apps. Samsung take note!\n* Quick official updates. Asus has a great track record with the updates.\n* Unlocked bootloader.\n* Keyboard dock is far more useful than it looks.\n* Cyanogenmod 10.1 works great here, has all the features of the Stock OS. ***EDIT: Cyanogenmod 11 works great as well, but as of this date not all keyboard functions are available. Still it is an improvement.***\n\nThe Bad:\n* The first versions were very laggy. It has improved greatly since then, specially with Cyanogenmod. ***EDIT: But the updates make no miracles, the lag persists.***\n* No 5Ghz Wireless-N Wi-Fi, limited to 2.5Ghz.\n* Inferior performance to similarly priced devices. This NAND truly sucks.\n* Expensive\n\nThe Ugly:\n* Propietary power connector. WHY, ASUS, WHY????? Make sure to buy spares.\n\nWritten in Ciudad de Panam, Panam on May 2nd, 2013"}

I got tired of buying actual books (Costly), and didn't like to have my laptop on those small classroom desks. With my laptop on the desk, I am forced to put my notebook on my thighs when taking notes.\n\nI read tons and tons of reviews, watch tons and tons of videos online to choose between the TF700T and the Note 10.1... Ended up getting the ASUS. I honestly regret that decision. The device began freezing up, and slowing down about 1 week after receiving it. Then at times the screen would flicker and present some lines going across the screen temporarily. I would either need to turn the screen off and back on to get rid of it, or it sometimes went away after a second or two.\n\n*****My BIGGEST issue with the ASUS tf700T is the slow response to interaction. I would sometimes try to open a PDF and it literally takes about 10+ seconds to open. That same PDF would open on my Galaxy S2 with no problems at all, so I know its the device and not the file. To sum it up, the TF700T that I got is way, way slower than my phone, and for a Tegra 3 device I find that unacceptable. The device also came with some light bleeds, which they rectified with the RMA.\n\n  I sent it into ASUS (At shipping cost to me) with the expectation of the problems being rectified. Apparently all I got back was a \"Hard reset\" device. After about another 3 or so days, the issues were all there again. The sluggish response, screen flickering, and occasion restarts. The device is in no way as fast or smooth as it was expected to be.\n\n  Now, I am not saying that the ASUS TF700T is not a good device. I have friends who own them, and lower models and they are quite pleased with them. With any product there are always a few bad ones in the batch. If only ASUS would realize that and replace my with a different one.\n\nIts an \"Ok\" device, but nothing that I consider worth $500."}

I purchased this tablet knowing ASUS was a decent manufacturer, but Android as the operating system, leaves out a lot to be desired. Starting out: At first, the interface seemed pretty neat with all the apps available. The functionality and user friendly factor is unfortunately not present. If you want to disable certain apps from operating such as email, it poorly effects other applications. You wouldn't expect an email app to degrade your \"Play Music\" app, but it does. Also, it seems like you can never rid any program on the tablet. It sneakingly finds it's way back on your tablet even though you don't want it. The 100 usless apps constantly update causing the user to manually select that you don't want these apps to update automatically and most apps of which you cannot uninstall. Switching between different apps is also upsetting. When I press the back key, expecting to re-visit the last page I was on, it goes to the home screen causing the user to now finger through your recent apps. I find that this sleek, thin, attractive ASUS tablet is not at all complemented and dragged down by the poor Android software. I also believe Android/Google does not make this \"Your\" tablet. It will always manipulate the apps and software to do what it wants to do, rather than the user. I find it more annoying to operate this tablet, than it's worth. It will definitely be replaced by a Microsoft tablet in the near future."}

I had purchased a SQUARETRADE warranty, luckily as it turns out, and I would advise anyone to purchase a SQUARETRADE warranty with any ASUS product!!!!  SQUARETRADE is AWESOME!!! I cannot say enough about their policies and swift action.  They put a 5 day limit on any repair and they had my device fully repaired and back in my hands in 5 days!

It will be ready when you get back.\n\nAlso, don't turn on automatic updates for your apps otherwise when you go use it will start downloading all your app updates and if you're going online it will obviously not be as fast as it could be due to the extra processes and installations running. This is no fault of the tablet, it's just the way any OS works."}

Because I loved my rather inadequately and would never recommend Smartphone from T-mobile (a Samsung Gravity Smart filled with bloatware and incapable of expanding even with a larger storage card), I finally decided on the Asus tablet because it struck me as the perfect hybrid between a true laptop and a tablet.  I found a great deal on a 64 gig open-box unit and they price-matched me on the keyboard (J&R in New York) and was sooooooooo excited I purchased over $150 in accessories before I even got the darn thing!  I will say this, I have NEVER experienced such awesome visuals in my life (and yesterday was my 50+++ birthday).  Truly amazing, crisp, beautiful -- I can't say enough.  That being said, for the price, it just wasn't worth it.  The sound quality is a joke as in, why the hell do you put 1 speaker in the rear only?  Yesterday (I did say it was my birthday, didn't I?) I caved and bought an iPad mini and the sound on it is 1,000x better than the Asus.  Also, my brand new (not opened box) keyboard had a \"T\" that kept sticking.  I type over 80 wpm, so when I key doesn't work, It screws up my rhythm big time.  It also made be wonder about Asus quality control.  I will acknowledge that I thought the tablet will be more like a laptop, i.e., able to have multiple \"windows\" open at once, etc., etc., so I have to bear some of the blame with respect to expectations.  Also, I had no idea 10\" could be so unwieldy.  I had seen and caressed the iPad when it first came out but it just didn't look that portable to me.  I think I had forgotten, and the Asus I believe is heavier than the iPad.  I carry a big pocketbook always but still, plopping it out at a restaurant was a bit unwieldy.  I'm currently \"in transition,\" (i.e., desperately seeking employment)so the cost was a huge issue.  So, as much as I didn't want to give Apple any money, for half the cost of the TF700T, I got an iPad mini which is more portable, gets more podcasts (which I will be able to hear without earphones) and has less accessories on which to waste money -- although I did order a keyboard for that, as well.  Unless the visuals are a real requirement for you, I, unfortunately, can't recommend this product."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I bought this tablet in December 2012.  It is my first real tablet, I own a Kindle Fire, but its more of an e-reader than a tablet.  I wanted a 10 tablet that I could use for school; I am a 3rd year, studying Civil Engineering.  A lot of our textbooks are available in PDF format or Digital format.  So obviously carrying around one 10 tablet as opposed to 4-5, 5-10 lb textbooks is a great trade!  I did a lot of research, looked at different brands, read tons of reviews and even played on tablets at every Best Buy, Walmart, Radio Shack, etc, that I could get my hands on.  I finally decided this was the tablet for me.\n\nMy deciding factors:\nHD Display\nExpandable battery (optional Dock)\nExpandable memory (MicroSD card slot)\nAndroid OS (Jelly Bean Update)\nSuperNote (preinstalled note taking app)\nPolaris Office (preinstalled)\n\nI ordered this tablet on Monday morning, and by Tuesday afternoon (using Prime Shipping) it was delivered.  After I charged up the tablet and turned it on I was definitely amazed at the display.  The HD on this tablet is very good.  The battery charged very quickly, I did notice the back of the tablet got very hot when charging.  But you cant feel it through the case I have it in.  The tablet automatically updated to Jelly Bean, which made the tablets web browser drag and crash like crazy.  I downloaded Boat Browser and have used that as the main browser ever since, it hasn't crashed on me yet (it also supports flash, BONUS!!).\n\nOverall I love this tablet, it is customizable (Hello its Android), lightweight, stylish and extremely easy to use.  I would definitely recommend this to any college student.  The price is a little steep compared to other tablets but the options for this tablet trump the competition."}

You know, if I wanted a full amped-out gaming machine, I would have stuck with a desktop on steroids. What I got was a solid functioning, usable platform. Add the keyboard/dock, and it met all my needs. I'm not expecting a tablet to be a full-fledged publishing platform - but the Polaris App makes working with Word/Excel/PowerPoint viable when I have to be mobile. I was torn between the Nexus 10 and the Transformer, but the 32G limitation with no SD expandability of the Nexus pretty much threw me to the Transformer. In addition, the amazing work that AstonSoft is doing on adapting their Essential PIM App to the Transformer has endeared me to it as a replacement for my Palm T/X, which HP obviously intends to let die on the vine since acquiring Palm. So all-in-all, from purely a personal needs and expectations viewpoint, I'm supremely pleased with my TF700T purchase."}

The tablet has replaced my laptop as a media consumption device. I had in mind to buy a second, but I will probably buy a Nexus 10 instead because the TF700 is so excruciatingly slow. Browsing web sites is a chore. It's difficult to type because the device is so slow that it often drops keystrokes. The problem is that it doesn't have enough RAM (1GiB vs. 2GiB on Nexus 10 and others). I was so frustrated with the sluggishness that the other day I went to see what things I could uninstall to make it faster. As it turns out, most of the memory is used by pre-installed Asus services which cannot be uninstalled. One such service (@vibe) has been spamming me.\n\nFor light usage the TF700 is okay, but it's overpriced and underperforms.\n\nUpdate (06/08/2012):\nThe recent push of Android 4.2.1 improves the memory usage quite a bit, but the tablet still feels generally sluggish compared to other Android devices. It is particularly evident when typing in the omnibox in Chrome, but even typing this review I have noticed stuttering."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I've noticed a lot of tablet reviews are written as if they're submittals for an engineering journal. I am an avionics and software engineer but will try to write something helpful for the majority of folks who buy tablets and are not engineers or hard core gamers. I just returned the TF700 to Amazon and bought a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 and I'll explain why. So here we go.\n\nAfter a lot of on line looking I decided to go with the ASUS TF700. Many times this model is rated at the top of the heap for all Android tablets. After getting one I'm not exactly sure how it gets rated that highly. Is it a bad tablet? No. That said, there's no real benefit here for the average to even slightly advanced tablet user so the value story isn't the best and it has a couple of issues which is why I gave 3 stars.\n\nOne major thing to know before you buy this model is that it can not effectively be recharged using anything but it's own power adapter. That may not sound like a big deal, but it is if you're highly mobile, don't want to carry extra stuff everywhere, or are prone to misplacing things. The last thing I want to do is have to carry separate adapters for all my electronics so I rely on charging via USB. This goes for my Android phone, my Ipod Touch, and everything else. The ASUS TF700 owner's manual says it will charge from a PC USB port but this is very misleading, if not an outright fib of sorts. Most USB ports, PC or otherwise do not have the voltage level this tablet requires. Hence, some ports/charger adapters will do a \"trickle charge\" while others will not work at all. Also, it's very important to note that if you find a USB port that works, it really is a trickle charge and the tablet screen can not be on or the tablet in use or it will stop charging altogether. The tablet will re-charge at a rate about 3% or so of the rate using the adapter....so be prepared to wait a very long time.\n\nThe TF700 is put together fairly well but it does have some parts that seem kind of cheap for a tablet in this price range.\n\nHere's a real kicker. It has the latest Tegra Quad Core processor, a fair amount of RAM (memory), and yet it's slow. Boot up time is twice as long as the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 and there are delays when working with your favorite software applications. Very little to none of this happens on the Samsung which is why this is a kicker because the Samsung only has the Dual Core \"slower\" processor. Without getting too technical, if the engineering isn't good a better processor can be offset by other lower quality parts or design and the result is the computer/tablet runs slower than an older or supposedly less capable one, and I think that's what happened with the TF700.\n\nThe TF700 has a very high resolution screen (think similar to the iPad Retina display). The problem is it actually doesn't render (display the picture to keep it simple) many things as well as some less capable lower cost tablets out there. As time goes by I'm sure new software apps and some updates from ASUS would probably make better use of the display.\n\nLastly, the TF700 uses battery power at a pretty good clip. Honestly, it was this issue combined with the inability to charge properly/efficiently from USB ports that caused me to return it. While I use a tablet for fun things, it is really a tool and like any other tool, it needs to be there when you need it.\n\nSo what are the benefits? If you're reeaaallllyy into games then this tablet may be for you. If you just play some games sometimes and you're kind of an Angry BIrds level type, you can do better with your money. For you gamers, the TF700 does have a lot of chops, but for some reason there are issues with the RAM even though it's the latest DDR technology. Again it's either an engineering or part quality issue so you may not get the performance you might think you'd be getting. The other benefit is the optional ASUS keyboard. If you still like to use a real keyboard at times, no one does this better than ASUS with a tablet. Clicking it on the keyboard makes the tablet look like a netbook. It stays petty lightweight but the keyboard has a built in battery that also powers the tablet for extra up time. It also has additional ports and a full size SD card slot.\n\nThe summary here is that unless you're a serious gamer and you like Android, save your money and go with one of the many other capable tablets out there. The Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 is on Amazon for about $120 less than the TF700, and if you're a Costco member they have it right now for $279. Impossible to go wrong at that price and the quality/performance of the Samsung. That said, there's also a few others out there as well. The bottom line is that super horsepower is not needed on a tablet for most users, and if it is needed for heavy work then you'd want to go with a Windows Pro tablet or Ultrabook anyway.\n\nHope this helps someone out there! Take care."}

I replied with an explanation that it was always in a case, and never dropped, etc. The only use was pluggin in and unplugging the tablet. I included links to forum posts complaining of the same problem. After another work without a reply, they told me I had two options: pay and they'll fix it, and don't pay and they'll send me back the broken unit. The worst customer service ever!

There is no message notification light.  I sort of got used to seeing the light blink when I had an email.  Not a big deal but something worth mentioning.\n2.  The tablet is so thin that I find the edges a bit sharp when reading a book.  Again, not a big deal since I can always change my grip or put it in some sort of case.\n3.  The built-in speaker is a bit tinny and doesn't put out a lot of volume. It does the job but not much more.  To be fair, the Xoom is my reference point and had some pretty good built-in speakers.\n4.  The speaker is on the back.  I much prefer the speakers on the front because that's where I am.\n\nThat's it for the bad.  Not so bad though is it?\n\nNow the good.\n\nThis tablet absolutely screams.  It is incredibly fast.  The display is awesome and easily handles even the highest resolution videos I can throw at it.  It's got a micro-SD card for extra expansion and a micro HDMI connector for connecting directly to a TV or monitor.  I believe the audio through the HDMI port (I haven't tried a headset yet) is much \"bigger\" than the Xoom.  The basses sound quite full and the high frequencies \"snap (that's good).\n\nBattery life is good but I wouldn't say it's exceptional.  I'm using the keyboard dock which has an extra battery.  I charge both devices every other day.  I'd say I'm a tablet power user so that's not too bad.  All in all, I'm happy with the battery life.\n\nThe Infinity is very light (compared to my Xoom) and seems to have a comparable feel to my wife's iPad Retina.  It is very stylish and I find the controls to be intuitively placed on the device.\n\nWith the exception of Scrabble Free (come on EA) all of my apps work very well on the Infinity.  The screen scrolls smoothly and I have not witnessed any slowness or jerky motion using the touch screen.  I'm not a gamer so I can't comment on game performance.  The automatic display brightness seems to work well in all levels of ambient light.\n\nAsus doesn't add much in the way of \"bloatware\" and what they do add seems to be useful (or can be disabled in most cases).\n\nI've got the keyboard dock (reviewed separately) which, IMO is a must if you're going to do much typing.  But, that would be the case with any tablet.  It's just that the Transformer line gives you a pretty good option.\n\nShort story:  I'm very happy with this purchase and might just become a long-term Transformer customer."}

One thing you know, you're using a table but then once you dock it on its keyboard it becomes a full blown mini laptop/notebook/netbook (whatever you want to call it). This is great for school, on the go type job, creating documents, watching a movie/tv (hulu, netflix, redbox instant, etc), and most importantly versitality and portability. I have their G series gaming laptop and it's too big to carry it around so I needed something for everyday use which I'm so glad I found this one. I'm happy to say that I'd recommend this to anyone who is looking for portability, ease of use, fun, build quality, HD screen for movies, etc. Other than wishing the speaker could be a lot louder than what it is right now, overall the product is great and will look forward to the next upgraded model of this thing. I'm going to upgrade every 18 months or so to keep things fresh ;)"}

The expectations were high as well, but ASUS lived up to it for the most part.\n\nThe display is simply awesome. Such clarity, great touch responses and HD quality. Secondly, the processor is just lightning fast. Really amazing performance.\n\nThe only downside for us really is the lack of Android to support dual users on one tablet. We would love to create two separate accounts or environments on one tablet, but the latest supported Android version does not provide that yet. Announcements of this new functionality have been given however, so this tablet may be worth a fifth star a few months from now!"}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I got the TF700T and the dock for it a few weeks ago, used it for about 10 days and exchanged it for a Samsung Note 10.1. I don't regret the switch one bit!\n\nHere's the somewhat lengthy bottom line:\n\n1) The TF700T has a fantastic screen with truly impressive resolution! It's essentially the same resolution as the iPad Retina. However, I believe this extra resolution results in...\n\n2) It is REALLY slow! Just switching screens and starting apps, etc. is truly painfully slow. It feels as if the tablet is virused or bogged with bloatware. But it's not. It appears that having double the resolution of other 10\" tablets is really taxing the system resources. Therefore, bouncing from app to app to crank out tasks takes many times longer than it should. I found that I was just going back to my Samsung Note II phone to do the tasks I got the TF700T for.\n\n3) Battery life is horribly poor. Because the TF700T is so slow, it must always remain in the high performance mode (fire symbol on the taskbar menu). I hardly ever even used the device but by the end of the day, the dock would be at 0% charge and the tablet at 50% or less charge.\n\n4) The dock's touchpad is SO sensitive that it was nearly impossible to type without constantly accidentally bouncing to unintentional areas of the page and/or highlighting entire sections and accidentally deleting them. Typing with the keyboard resulted in so much error that remedying those errors took FAR FAR longer than just typing with the on-screen keyboard. Also, despite only having the keyboard for about 10 days and literally only typing on it for about an actual hour, either the \"T\" or \"7\" key (sorry, forget which one) came off. It's only held on by adhesive so I just stuck it back on and it looked fine. When I returned it to BestBuy, I did mention the key to the guy at the counter and he told me that returned Asus stuff just goes back to the distributor and they get credited back so no loss to them. Good. Because this quality is simply atrocious.\n\nSUMMARY: If you have a Samsung smartphone, your transition to the Note 10.1 will be seamless. Samsung's user interface is MUCH better than the TF700T's. Yes, they're both running Ice Cream Sandwich, but each company has its tweaks and Samsung's though rather subtle on the surface make a truly material difference in practice. Particularly the \"Samsung Keyboard\" feature vs. the \"Asus Keyboard.\" The Samsung \"Continuous Input\" (sliding fingers across keys like Swype) feature is LIGHT YEARS better than Asus' version. The Asus sliding keystroke feature thing, like its dock's keyboard, is only good in theory but in practice works so poorly that it's actually a negative and therefore useless.\n\nAll in all, I have to admit that though I wanted to love the TF700T+dock combo, I wound up disgusted with everything about it except the beautiful screen. The Samsung Note 10.1 is SO SO much better at EVERYTHING except resolution that this is a no-brainer decision. Plus, the Note 10.1 has front-facing stereo speakers and the Asus a rear-facing mono speaker that's poorly placed. The Note's battery life is FAR superior. I never even think about battery life with it and I use it way more than I did my Asus.\n\nThis is a really really easy decision, folks. If you're going high-end Android tablet, there is a clear winner and that is the Samsung Note 10.1. For now at least. Who knows what will pop up next week? ;)"}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "After reading tons of reviews on every possible android tablet out there I finally settled on the ASUS Infinity TF700 thinking it would be the ultimate smooth, lightweight take-everywhere productivity machine.  Of course I have a full blown desktop, and full sized laptop, but I wanted something that could do it all for general and business production, and still be small and portable.  I also bought the docking keyboard in order to use it as a stripped down, small laptop.  I was replacing a 3 year old Toshiba Netbook that I absolutely loved and used when I traveled or ran to meetings but it was time to upgrade.  I've been using the Android OS on my phones for years so I was already up to speed on how to operate the tablet.  Right out of the box it was the same and a snap to set-up.  I love all the Android applications, OS, widgets etc much better than the Apple OS, by far.  So I was super excited to receive this.\n\nThe look, feel and build quality of the Transformer it is second to none.  I got the 64GB version that comes in a cool champagne (goldish-silver) polished metal case. It is truly one sleek, sexy light machine.  Everywhere I went people asked \"wow, what is that?\".  The screen resolution was amazing, with crisp graphics and rich deep colors.  Glare on the screen was non-existent.  Hard buttons on the tablet are positioned in just the right place, and the snap-in connection of the docking keyboard is easy, tight, and seamless.  Once connected, the keyboard \"takes over\" and functions pretty much like a regular laptop keyboard, while still allowing you to use all the touch functionality of a the tablet.  Pretty cool.  Over all the hardware is amazing.\n\nUnfortunately I cannot say the same thing for the performance of this tablet, which ultimately led me (reluctantly) to return it.  At first I thought maybe something was wrong with the software on this unit and not the hardware, but l am an Android power user so I know how to cold-boot, root, install custom ROMs etc in order to eliminate software conflicts etc.  After tweaking with this incessantly, the performance was just not smooth at all.  I am convinced it is a hardware problem.  Screens took too long to load, widgets didn't refresh quickly, and swiping across multiple home screens was jerky and slow.  And don't even get me started on the Browser problems.  Terrible!  Google it, its a known problem.  Constant slowdowns, crashing (\"browser has stopped responding, Wait or Cancel\"? ) Arg!  I installed every browser available and they were all slow.\n\nI know all these minor issues may sound nit-picky, because the tablet does work, but considering a small portable computer like this should be lighting fast, gets used on-the-fly , and constantly to surf the internet, the performance slowdowns were a big problem for me.  Also, you should know that Adobe has stopped support for the Flash Player plug-in for Android so you won't find it in the PlayStore.  This is not a problem for most mobile-webpages but can be for some full-blown flash enabled desktop-webpages (ie pandora.com).  Fortunately you can find it online elsewhere (look at xda-developers) and side-load it.  This isn't a huge problem and certainly is not the fault of the hardware, but it just contributed to my overall frustration.\n\nI should note that I am comparing speed to my Android phone running the exact same OS (Jelly Bean) so that was my expectations for this tablet.  The result is my phone is much faster, much smoother in side-by-side comparisons.  Also my daughters iPad 2 is much smoother, and way faster loading pages, swapping sites etc.  Im not a big fan of the Apple OS which is why I wanted an Android tablet, but the Apple hardware performance on tablets is the best, period.  I hate saying that.  Darn.  I was really hoping this sexy piece of hardware would be as good as that, without the annoying Apple OS, but I was wrong.  Darn again.\n\nUltimately this is a very well built machine that is just not up to par in performance.  If you are patient and don't mind the herky-jery motion, long browser load times, the annoying crashes, and you want the sexiest piece of hardware out there to set on the conference table, this is the machine for you.  If you want more than just good looks, I would suggest you look elsewhere.\n\nPros \nSleek, sexy metal case\nWow factor\nAmazing screen\nWell laid out hard buttons\nVery well integrated docking keyboard\n\nCons \nJerky screen transitions\nSlow loading applications\nTerrible browsing experience\nMany desktop websites don't function correctly"}

I called ASUS, they told me I would have to pay $250 because I unlocked the software and they would not honor their warranty (obviously unlocking the software broke the power connector).

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "When I decided I wanted to buy a new tablet I did a lot of research first.  Here are some of the reasons I chose this one over the others on the market:\n\nApp Selection\nPrior to the Infinity I owned the Blackberry Playbook and it was a great tablet for its time except for the app selection.  Although Android doesn't have quite as much selection as Apple's App store it has plenty for my needs.  I have never wanted an App that I couldn't find in the Android Play Store.\n\nGPS and Google Maps\nThe great thing about Google Maps on Android is that you can download maps for offline use.  I currently own an Iphone 5 and my wife has an iPad 2 but neither of those can download maps for offline use even when using Google Maps.  The Infinity also has built in unassisted GPS.  That means I can take it with me camping in the mountains and still view my offline maps and use GPS even without cell phone signal.\n\nStorage Capacity\nWhen I bought my Infinity it was $500 for the 32 gb version, whereas the current iPad was only 16 gb for the same price.  I was not willing to pay more than $500 for a tablet so the extra storage capacity was a big plus.  Furthermore, the Infinity comes with a nice mini SD card expansion slot which allows you to double the storage capacity with another 32 gb sd card.\n\nSmoothness of Operating System\nI tested many of the other hot Android tablets but none of them were as smooth and fluid as the Infinity.  Even the Galaxy Note seemed to get gummed up by ordinary day-to-day operations.  The Infinity feels like it's actually running a robust operating system that doesn't leave you hanging for extended moments of time after trying to swap apps in a bout of multi-tasking.\n\nAsus Makes it Great\nAsus has done a great job at restraining themselves from the tempting urge of over modifying the Android system.  They have left it clean without adding too much bloatware.  They also shipped it with one really nice app though, SuperNote.  I use SuperNote for all types of note taking activities because it allows me to write in normal handwriting without typing on the awkward tablet keyboard.  Although it is not without a few glitches I'm sure it will only get better with updates, and it already works great.  If you want a tablet for the note taking abilities, just buy a $5 stylus on Amazon and use the SuperNote app.  Another nice app is the video editing app.  Although it's a little glitchy, I'm amazed that I can actually edit my home videos right on my tablet.  Apps aside, Asus has also done a great job with the design.  The build quality is excellent.  Maybe not quite as solid as an iPad, but it feels like quality when you're holding it.  The Super IPS+ screen sure is bright too.  The resolution and brightness certainly exceed the large majority of other Android tablets out there.\n\nThe Bad\nYes, there are disappointments to every tablet, but the Infinity only has a few of them.  The number one is battery life.  The iPad definitely has a longer battery life, but compared to other Androids the Infinity still has great battery life.  I use it heavily for about two days before charging and it charges pretty fast.  The second bad point is that the Android OS is not as fluid as iOS.  No matter how hard they try, the fact of the matter is Android is not as robust of an operating system.  On the other hand the Android system is more user modifiable which was a big plus to me.  (Please don't argue about the definition of \"robust\" in the comments, the fact is you have to trade one for the other.)  The third point is that the Android Play Store does not offer a large selection of tablet optimized apps.  All the apps still work on the Infinity but non-optimized apps just don't look as beautiful.  So there you have it.\n\nThe Skinny\nI chose this tablet over other Android tablets because it has great build quality and runs smoother than comparable tablets.  I chose it over the iPad because you get more storage, unassisted GPS, offline maps, and the SuperNote app.  I've owned it for about a month and a half and I would definitely buy it again.\n\n(Another disclaimer: yes I did compare the Infinity to the iPad, in addition to comparing it to other Android tablets.  The reality is they are marketed in the same category and I myself had to choose between them.  Sorry to you anti-Apple die-hards but I like to feel like I am giving an unbiased review.)"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "For the past few years when tablets were just starting to become the new \"it\" thing to have, I shunned them quite a bit.  To me, they were nothing more than really expensive toys with very limited functionality.  Well, tablets have grown up quite a bit over the years, so my inner hypocrite shined and I decided to go out and get one.  The Asus Infinity TF700 was not my first choice actually.  Originally I wanted to get the Asus Vivo Tab Smart, which I did end up getting at Best Buy for a pretty good price.  The Vivo Tab Smart runs full Windows 8, and only runs for around $499 which isn't that bad at all.  Everything about it is pretty solid, except one thing... If you have never owned or used a Windows 8 tablet before, please keep reading.  Windows 8 in itself is not a bad OS, it is an OS I believe is strictly made for tablet devices, but that's just me.  The problem is this, when navigating your Start Screen it is a great device, but problems lurk the further you dive in.  For instance, when you are navigating through your main desktop on a Windows tablet it is freaking nightmare.  The main problem is you are in the end navigating your way through an OS that is meant for use with a classic mouse and keyboard.  The Start Screen = Great.  The Desktop = No Bueno.  And there is really no way around not using your desktop at least most of the time you're on your Windows tablet.  So that is what did it, just using your fingers to navigate outside the Start Screen is more aggravating than anything.  Even on a screen with a res of 1366x768 everything is STILL to small to try and touch. You go to click on something and you have to zoom in A LOT to hit the right button or link.  And you can't do that everywhere.  I even had a stylus I was using and it didn't always work the way I wanted it to.  I think Windows 8 needs A LOT of work.  The Desktop screen should have been optimized more in tablets especially, and the Windows Store needs to expand very fast and maintain functionality if it has any hopes at competing with the Google Play and Apple Store markets.\n\nSo, after I returned my Asus Vivo Tab Smart, I went on to my fallback.  The Asus TF700 Infinity Tab.  I was less than excited about getting a tablet that only ran Android OS, but I was open minded about it.  And all I can say in the end is, WOW!! This is an experience 10x better than I had with the Windows 8 Tablet.  EVERYTHING is touch optimized, because well...Android is a mobile based OS, so it kinda has to be :D  The Full HD Screen is absolutely stunning, the build quality is strong and solid, the OS is incredibly easy to navigate through, even for a first time Android user like myself.  The cons on this thing are, well...there are really only two as far as I'm concerned right now.  One is the battery, Wi-Fi eats up A LOT of juice, even on power-saver settings.  So I can at best stretch the battery life to 8-10 hours.  Second is the volume/power buttons.  The edges on this tablet (like most tablets) are beveled, or rounded.  I wish that tablets were made more squared on the edges with very sharp slightly rounded edges.  This would make button issues go away, by placing the buttons on a flatter as opposed to rounded corner surface.  But because the buttons are positioned on a beveled edge, they are a lot more cumbersome.  They are difficult to press at times, and feel slightly loose on occasion.  That is it though in way of issues, for me anyway.\n\nIn all, this is a GREAT tablet, Asus makes wonderful products and this one doesn't disappoint.  This tablet is great for photographers, graphic artists looking to showcase their artwork, light gamers, the e-book enthusiast, and social network guru.  One of the best tablets on the market right now."}

It features a very slick screen, and great performance from wifi, bluetooth, and GPS connectivity.  The included software is ok, not great.  As a book reader the screen is fantastic.  Being a long time Windows user I find Android to be somewhat awkward.  I am putting effort into acclimating to this tablet, but general browsing is clunky and when it comes to watching videos the YouTube app does not always work.  Some USB ports would be nice. And the proprietary charge port seems silly when so many devices are using micro-USB.  The battery life does not seem to be exceptional, indeed it isn't much more than my laptop.  I bought a stylus, which has made my using experience MUCH BETTER.  All of these devices should come with a stylus.  While this is a better device to me than a relatives iPad, for the money I think a traditional laptop is far more usable."}

Keep in mind that all of the comments below are factors which occur when the tablet is running on 'High Performance Mode' (the UI in this Andoid build allows you to choose between Power Saving, Balanced, and High Performance modes) :\n\nThe Great Factors:\n- Amazing standby life\n- Brightest tablet display I've ever seen, quick UI\n- Great Memory Capacity\n- Extreme Battery Life when attached to keyboard\n\nThe Mediocre:\n- After 6 months of use it has been slowing down significantly.\n- All Email apps are slow to load 50% of the time\n- WiFi/Wireless can be spotty/slow 50% of the time\n- ALL Browsers (stock-browser, Chrome, and Dolphin are what I've used) are extremely slow. This includes starting up, opening new tabs,  and bringing up the keyboard (when you press on the address bar).\n\nThe AWFUL:\n- The \"Audio\" is a godawful single speak with hardly ANY 'Umph' / Volume.  Great for SongPop. Terrible for anything else, especially video chatting or playing music. Your phone has better audio....\n- Keyboard does NOT act like a typical Android keyboard, let alone a Windows/MacOS one. Highlighting, Copy-pasting, and other functions either have differing keyboard input commands from program to program or have no keyboard input comands available at all.  The 'stock' word processing programs are terrible, and the keyboard works horrendously with Gmail/stock email apps.\n- Word processing programs have terrible save functions, and often lose data when using the keyboard and switching between programs.  Essentially, you can save your file, switch to a browser to research, and then return to the word processor only to have lost your data.  Additionally, of the 5 processing programs I've tried, all have saved earlier versions of documents over current ones causing significant loss of work.\n-All Video players function as intended 50% of the time - this includes playing files on the tablet's internal memory.  Often they will get choppy, freeze screens, or just fail and shut down\n\nOverall:If I was looking for a tablet to work as a tablet only, I'd still consider the Transformer for the Screen Size, Battery Length, Brightness, and Memory.  Still, if I could find something which performed better and had enhanced audio, I'd jump on that IMMEDIATELY!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "This tablet is incredible and I don't even know where to start. It does everything as advertised and fulfills its specs. It's very fast and responsive, although rarely it does lag and freeze up for a few secs. Once I did receive it, the battery was dead. Upon reading the manual it says charge it up to 8 hours before use, which I did. After turning it on, a few minutes later you will be prompted to update to the latest firmware. After updating you will receive all the latest update for it and the latest version of ice cream sandwich. Unfortunately at the moment jelly bean isn't available yet, but Asus has declared that the do plan to bring jelly bean to the tablet. The new version of Android doesn't include flash player since Adobe has discontinued it. You can still install flash player by downloading the latest apk file and installing it using the file manager on the tablet. It does come with a few bloatware that can't be uninstalled unless you root the tablet, but some of it is useful. For those who are looking to game, the Tegra 3 processor is for you. You can play games like Grand theft auto 3, Max payne, and even emulators from the market place. As for the hardware, the display is very nice and delivers true HD. It does come with a cleaning cloth for the screen and cleans it very well. The rear camera records and takes pictures in a very high quality while the front is good quality, but much noticeable than the rear. It does read and accept a 64GB micro sd card. Many people have complained about the speaker placement. It does affect the sound since it's going away from you and will sound muffled if your hand is in the way. However, it does deliver great and precise volume. The battery lasts a very long time, but will drain faster if you have the tablet in performance mode rather than power saving mode. An option of a docking station is available to you which I got and I'm very glad I did. It turns the tablet into a netbook. The dock give the tablet another 5-6 hours of battery and works by when the tablet's battery falls around 70%, it will start to be charged by the dock. The dock is just like a laptop's keyboard. It includes an sd card reader (not micro), a USB 2.0 slot, and a charging slot. The price the tablet sells for is definitely worth it. I highly recommend this to anyone who is interested in an android tablet."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "Let me start by saying I have been working on and building computers for about 20 years. Although I hadn't bought a tablet up to this point, the ASUS was my choice after much research for the following reasons: 1. This tablet has the best HD screen on the market second only to the current iPad 4.  2. The quad core cpu and 10.1 inch screen is comparable to if not better than the iPad 4.  3. For what I needed the tablet to do and the apps that are available for it (this is where some people may need to do their own research for apps vs needs as the iPad still has quite a few more apps available to the consumer), this product has (sold separately and I bought) the available keyboard which also has a battery that will charge the tablet (until the battery on the keyboard runs out) while they are connected together. Then when I disconnect them, the tablet is still charged once I am done using the keyboard.  4. Also unlike the iPad, this has a micro SD card slot for extra storage space up to 32GB as well as a micro HDMI slot for connecting to a TV.  5. The keyboard, when attached, also has an available full sized SD card slot as well as a USB port (which is what I use the most to transfer files from my computer).\nAs you can see, there are quite a few more features externally on this ASUS tablet that I use that must be paid for separately if you buy an iPad.  Oh and let me mention that this has 32GB of internal memory when you buy it for the same or less price than the 16GB iPad. So far it has worked extremely well for my needs and runs very well. As almost every computer that has an operating system (Android on this), I have had a few \"lockups\" or \"freezes\" that require a reboot of the system. This doesn't appear to be out of the normal range.  I highly recommend this product to anyone needing a tablet and will buy from ASUS again in the future should my needs again require their products."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I have been waiting awhile to get this device. I originally bought a Nexus 7 and while I love that device it has a few caveats that make it a less than ideal device. Storage space, and HDMI out being the too major reasons I wanted a tablet with expandable storage. My wife is the apple enthusiasts so I am not going to get into any apple versus discussions.\n\nThe tf700 is greatly expandable. With the on board micro-sd card slot and the keyboard dock's full size SD slot you can add 2x64gb more space to your tablets base memory. I went with 64gb model as I learned a long time ago that I need to future proof as much as possible as I may not have the funds later to get more. Altogether with base memory that's 192gb of minus whatever is used by the system. Not to mention with the full size USB port on the dock means flashdrives and portable hd's can also be used.\n\nWhy would I need all that space you might wonder. For emulation mainly. While a lot of the early arcade emulators use very small ROM files, when you get into later post street fighter II era a lot of games used CDROM drives or other high capacity storage devices because games became larger. Mame4droid requires chd files which eat up space fast. Not to mention ps1 emulation where games get up to 1gb or more in size so I will need a lot of room if I want to have a larger later game variety.\n\nYou can find a ton of info on this device's tech specs but ultimately it is use that determines value for me and this has all my wants covered. Its versatility is amazing and being able to play all those old retro games from just about every console up to ps1 (Dreamcast has an emulator in the works) with controllers is a dream come true.\n\nI have introduced all my kids to the wonders of neo-geo, the PC-engine, and all of Sega's and Nintendo's early consoles/handheld's. I am already planning on getting them some nabi 2s so they can play these games on their own devices. These android tablets, to me, blow away any gaming handhelds on the market now with a few exceptions IMHO.\n\nThe best resource for info on how to get the most from the tf700 is to just go do a YouTube search. They have a ton of tutorials and reviews. Oh and the icing on the cake is I can also use it for movies/music/reading. I had to get another android device because I am always draining my N7 and the extra battery dock on the tf700 means the N7 will finally get a rest from usage.\n\nOne last thing while on my window's PCs I use ATI cards I love nvidias tegra chip set as it seems to get better support on android devices versus other manufacturer's chip sets. Implementation seems better to me after trying out other devices. Once I get my HTC one x plus my tegra 3 triumvirate will be complete. A tegra 3 triforce if you will."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "Review updated: March 1, 2013\n\nIn a nutshell: The Asus Transformer TF700 tablet and mobile dock have a few problems likely to frustrate all users.  Also, users interested in purchasing them for productivity purposes (i.e. as a netbook/laptop substitute) are likely to find them inadequately mature.  However, they're better now than before.\n\n--------\n\nWhile the several comments my original post received have helped me realize that none of my concerns are related to Asus hardware problems proper, but rather to Android/app problems, I'm afraid I cannot yet raise my rating if I am to be fair to potential buyers.  Although I realize Asus is not to blame for either Android OS or Android app limitations, unfortunately, in actual user experience, hardware, OS, and app experience are merged. That is, while the helpful comments below have clarified that my Transformer's inability to display two windows side by side is an Android OS problem and that inconsistent keyboard shortcut support is due to the inconsistent implementation of standard shortcuts across Android apps, rather than to Asus Transformer hardware problems, my net result is unchanged: I can still view only one window at a time, and keyboard shortcuts are still only sparsely available. I must therefore rate the Transformer accordingly because the capabilities (or lack thereof) of OSes and apps DO affect potential buyers' decisions (e.g. One reason I bought the Transformer, with its Android OS, rather than an iPad is because everything I'd read about the Android app, Kingsoft Office, indicated it would meet the specifics of my word processing needs whereas Apple's Pages and other iPad office software would not).\n\nI recently upgraded my system to Android Jelly Bean (which has completely resolved my previously-mentioned non-display problem for several symbol characters typed using the mobile dock) and because of that as well as the comments my original post received,  I decided to extensively retest my Transformer today. Unfortunately, I still have to conclude that Android--and therefore the Asus Transformer Infinity--is not yet ready for \"big-time\" in terms of productivity and actually has significant problems likely to prove a frustration for all users.\n\nI've done my retesting of the TF700'S capabilities with the five productivity apps I care about most as a teacher and grad student(i.e. the default Browser, Chrome, Kingsoft Office, Google Drive, and RepliGo Reader). I outline my results below:\n\n--------\n\nFirst of all, although I hate to add concerns not mentioned in my previous review, several problems likely to affect even non-productivity users came up during retesting, namely:\n\na) Both Chrome and the default browser load Web pages--and therefore scroll much more slowly--than either my (dying) Asus netbook or Mac desktop do (I assume this is because of the Transformer's high-definition screen resolution?--i.e., it takes a long time to display all those pixels?)\n\nb) Both Chrome and the default browser FREQUENTLY freeze so I get messages like \"Browser isn't responding.  Do you want to close it?\"  (Probably because I get impatient with the slow loading/scrolling of Web pages as described in \"a\" above!)\n\nc) Sometimes the Transformer screen fails to respond to my touch, so I have to play around with it to get it to recognize I've touched it at all, or that I want to select text rather than merely insert something at a particular point.\n\n--------\n\nProductivity users are likely also to have a problem with the following:\n\n1) Keyboard shortcuts: I wrote in my original post that \"Android keyboard shortcut support in connection with the mobile dock is spotty, most importantly with \"Ctrl + X,\" \"Ctrl + C\" and \"Ctrl + V.\"  Now, however, \"Ctrl + X,\" \"Ctrl + C\" and \"Ctrl + V\" do function in Chrome (though it would be nice if Chrome also responded to \"Ctrl + Z\" because I discovered during my retesting that I was unable to UNDO my copy-and-paste retesting experiments in any other way other than reselecting/copying the text I'd experimented with and then re-pasting it back where it was before!)  However, keyboard shortcuts like cut, copy, paste, undo, and redo do not work in the default Asus browser (with either browser-accessed Google docs or Facebook) nor in  RepliGo Reader (which I use instead of Adobe Reader because Android Adobe Reader opens Google Drive-stored pdfs in a protected--i.e. non-annnotatable--format). However Kingsoft Office has excellent keyboard shortcut support per my limited test (cut, copy, paste, undo, redo).\n\nContinued concern: Keyboard shortcuts are sooooooooooo important to productivity!!! Android, please encourage your app-producers to implement ALL of the common ones and as many others as possible.  I think using tablets for productivity purposes will only be viable if (at least the most common) keyboard shortcuts users are used to from desktops/laptops/netbooks function equally well on Android.\n\n--------\n\n2) Apps display full-screen only (i.e. It's impossible to multi-task via two windows side by side): As far as I can tell, none of my top five productivity apps--i.e. Chrome, the default browser, Kingsoft Office, RepliGo Reader, or Google Drive--allow for display of two app windows or same app/multiple documents to display side by side (i.e. These apps aren't available as \"floating apps.\")\n\nContinued concern: While most users may not think Android's inability to handle side-by-side window display is a big deal as long as they view content via the Transformer's tablet screen only, I assume I'm not alone as a productivity user in being used to connecting a netbook/laptop to an external monitor and to easy side-by-side window viewing and copying and pasting.  (In fact, because my responsibilities as a teacher frequently involve back-and-forth interactions with multiple documents connected to student writing--e.g. our course website where my grading guide and gradebook are located and a student's paper in a word processor--any OS without this feature, in my mind, is not at all viable for productivity purposes.)\n\n--------\n\nOn the positive side, I do want to report that the text-selection concerns I mentioned in my original post have been almost entirely resolved. I received a tip in the Transformer forums that text can be selected using \"shift + arrows\" in editable text areas and my testing has demonstrated that the tip works in all five apps included in my retesting. In addition, I discovered \"shift + arrows\" also works to extend already-selected (via long-press) text in NON-EDITABLE text areas in all the above apps except RepliGo Reader!  (And \"shift + arrows\" is MUCH easier to control than dragging the text selection grips--I think it's quite as good as the mouse-click-and-drag functionality so many of us are used to from desktop/laptop/netbook systems!)  However, unfortunately the text in Chrome-accessed Word documents stored in Google Drive is not selectable by any means and the same is true when it comes the hyper-link spiderweb text of TED Talk transcripts that I like to use in my teaching of English language learners (though, admittedly, even on Windows or Mac, the hyperlinked nature of TED Talk transcript text means it can only easily be selected from the bottom up).  I assume few users will care about these concerns, however. What they are more likely to have problems with in terms of text-selection are 1) The tablet screen sometimes fails to recognize a user's touch, with the result that text selection is significantly slowed down or stopped, and 2)while mobile dock text selection DOES work well in editable text areas, the long-press step built into Android's text selection process for NON-EDITABLE text areas still makes text selection for these areas a relatively slow process (compared to that in editable areas and in any kind of Windows/Mac OS text area.)\n\nI do expect Asus and Android will ultimately resolve the above remaining problems.  The dying netbook I mentioned in my previous post is an Asus netbook that has served me extremely well until my exceptionally demanding use of it finally caught up.  My previous outstanding experience with Asus in relation to my netbook HAS convinced me of the company's interest in making top-quality, user-centered products and my less-than-positive Transformer experience has not yet altered my opinion (especially given the very helpful post by Tien, Asus Customer Loyalty representative!).  I have no doubt that Asus will communicate to Android its users' concerns and as much as possible, \"pressure\" Android to put effort into developing its OS to enable it to meet the needs of its less productivity-oriented users as well as (the potentially large population of) users who have substantial productivity needs they want their tablet to meet. And I assume Android will be responsive, not only in continuing to develop its OS, but also in continuing to encourage app developers to take advantage of its increasing OS capabilities as they're developed.\n\n--------\n\nIn conclusion, because I would not have purchased the Asus Transformer TF700 tablet and mobile dock if I had known the above listed concerns were a problem, I do unfortunately still have to conclude: The Asus Transformer TF700 tablet and mobile dock are not (yet) mature enough to be used for productivity purposes (i.e. as a netbook/laptop substitute), and I need to add, they also have weaknesses likely to trouble even non-productivity users.\n\nMonica R\n\nP.S. I'm very sorry that it's taken me more than a week to respond to the helpful comments my original post received.  I've barely touched my Transformer since writing that post because, as both a teacher and grad student, I've been drowning in work and therefore have been opting to use my office desktop because it allows me to avoid the above-listed concerns as well as allows me to work with maximum efficiency because its OS is familiar.\n\nP.P.S.  Although one commenter felt my \"On the positive side, a touchscreen is addicting!!!\" postscript on my original post only displayed my smartphone/tablet naivety, I will freely admit I am touchscreen-naive, and for the sake of other new-to-touchscreen-technology potential buyers, say again that touchscreens ARE addicting (i.e Once you've had one, you automatically try to touch other screens to make them scroll or whatever, even though, if you were thinking about it, you know they're not touchscreen-enabled!)"}

(I went to the Prime from the Motorola XOOM because I wanted the latest and the greatest.). I thought I'd give ASUS another try and bought this tablet, thinking that with the second generation Transformer they would get things right.\n\nFor all the hype this tablet has, and the reviews, I'd give it a C-.  For all the money I paid for the thing, performance it average.  It is laggy.  I/O performance is poor. I see no difference between normal mode, power-saving mode, and performance mode. Sometimes the touch screen is not accurate; at times the touches seem \"off\" as to where I am trying to touch; not by much, but it's there.  No matter what program I use, I get frustrated just trying to type something because the tablet is unresponsive. I had better responsiveness on my old XOOM. Using the dock is better, but it makes the tablet a little awkward to use (I would get out my notebook, then.).\n\nHow many times I reformatted, cold-booted, and did the other suggestions out there on the web...well, nothing worked. Am I the only one? Go over to XDA Forums and read. It was suggested that the more programs you put on the tablet, the slower it becomes. That's why I bought the tablet with all that memory; so I could put all my programs on it.  Why would I buy a tablet with all the memory and not use that memory because it degrades performance?\n\nWhen I first called them, Asus tech support was good; they responded promptly, and I received the unit back in no time. However, I still have lag and poor I/O performance. Because of the lag, I was willing to unlock the device, void the warranty, and install a custom rom that supposedly makes the tablet run better, but I keep getting the network error response.  I called tech support again, but after the initial response, I have heard nothing, although I did receive the email to rate the service.\n\nOn the physical side, I usually hold the tablet in my palms. Depending how you hold it, the tablet may dig into them. I also cradle the tablet between my thumb and forefinger. The bottom of the tablet digs into my flesh.\n\nOn the whole it is not a bad tablet. Tech Support was pretty good. It just isn't worth the high price. It's an average tablet with an over-average price. If you want to use it for the Internet (and it doesn't even have 5Ghz!) or play an occasional game, get something cheaper, or wait for the new technology to come out. I bought it for the dock, but I really don't use it that much; I'll end up going to my desktop with the better keyboard. People swear by the thing; others bitterly complain. There's no consistency. You may get a good unit, or you may get a bad one (not the occasional bad one either; there's too many people complaining). I got a bad one. Too much hastle for the money.\n\nDon't buy this product based just on the specs. Do your homework before you buy. This tablet has better graphics than my old XOOM, but I'd rather have a tablet that works when I want it to rather than having to wait."}

I switched because after a couple OEM updates, no changes were had with the lag.  Also, wireless is slow with web browsing - pauses about 3/4 the way through loading a webpage.  Still have the occasional lockup, but not nearly as often.  Sbdags, the developer of the CROMi-X rom releases new updates frequently, and he has really helped this tablet.  I still would not recommend it though.  Too underpowered and lags.\n\nI bought ASUS's flagship product and had some pretty high expectations.  While the tablet is ok I am disappointed.  It lags badly on I/O operations and crashes occasionally requiring a hard reset.  I always restore the tablet to factory after an upgrade and have used the cold boot option but the issues persist.  The I/O lag is a well documented issue on this tablet.  People that have used the custom ROM CleanROM have reported that these issues have been fixed and the tablet operates like it should.  ASUS should really look into using their code.  I won't unlock yet because I don't want to lose my factory warranty which is ridiculous.\n\nSadly, I would not suggest buying this tablet if you are looking for the best.

I've had it for a month now and it just seems to get worse as time goes by.\n\nI have however looked into unlocking and rooting it. From 95% of the people I've spoken with they claim it's a whole new tablet after you do that. It supposedly operates like it should from the factory. Only problem is, when you unlock it, you lose your factory warranty. I did however purchase a 3-year squaretrade warranty. But still, it should come out of the box operating well without having to mod it and lose the factory warranty. Come'on Asus!\n\nI've also heard from many people that Asus's customer service is horrible. I've never personally had to deal with them. But you read enough and you get a good idea what kind of company it is.\n\nNow, besides the lag of the tablet, the design is pretty nice. It feels like a solid piece of hardware. One thing that would have been nice would have been stereo speakers on the front of the tablet. However the factory mono speaker is adequate especially once you download the \"Volume +\" app to boost the volume. There's a few glitches in the \"Jelly Bean\" operating system, but I'm hoping with updates they will go away.\n\nThe expandability of the tablet and options are great. I do have a pretty good amount of screen bleed. Also the Gorilla Glass 2 isn't all that it's cracked up to be. I keep mine in a case and after a month I've noticed some light scratches on the screen. From what? I don't know... however I'm a stickler about keeping my electronics looking new and can't think of anything that would have caused the scratches besides coming from the factory like that.\n\nI'll keep it, I still like it, but like I said, for $600 I should be a lot more satisfied and I'm not...."}

It replaced my Kindle, since it is has a backlit display (my old Kindle does not), and because the display area is so much larger that it feels like a real book.\n\n2. Watching movies. Speakers are a bit weak if you have to fill the room with sound or if there is any background noise. If, however, you are using headphones or have a portable rechargeable speaker (many are in the $10-20 range), you will do just fine.\n\n3. Browsing the web. Stock browser seemed slow to me, so did Chrome. I switched over to Dolphin for a happy medium of performance and feature set (use the same for my Android phone).\n\n4. Emails.\n\nWhat I like:\n--------------\nSharp looking tablet.\nI have a dock, which makes typing emails a breeze.\nI downloaded remote desktop equivalent for Android, so now it doubles as a small laptop (Ultrabook-like), which allows me to use Windows when I need to.\n\nWhat I don't like:\n------------------\nI had an issue with it latching properly to the dock, and I had to send the dock first, and, subsequently, the dock and the tablet to ASUS for repair. They replaced the latching mechanism in the dock itself, and did something in the tablet (all mechanical), so now it is all good.\n\nI think the battery life is a bit shorter than what is claimed (I have not done the \"marketing test\" of watching the streaming movie at X brightness) but overall it is quite acceptable, and the dock does do miracles at ensuring the tablet's battery does not drop below 80% until the dock is completely exhausted.\n\nTips:\n------------------\n1. If you load up a new app, do a cold boot (not just a reboot).\nIt will prevent many of the white/black screen freezes that some people have reported. Most installed apps are fine the way they are, but it does not hurt to do a clean boot to be sure.\n\n2. Given that the battery has a fixed lifetime and a fixed number of recharges, charge it when it is close to being completely drained.\n\n3. Enjoy. 7 months later it is still one of the coolest tablets :)"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I bought this tablet to replace the TF300 that I got to replace the TF201...I'll make that story make sense first, haha\n\nI got the 201 to try out the whole thing at Best Buy and returned it due to the crappy WiFi signal it's notorious for. I loved the experience and knew I'd be replacing it soon after. I read about the TF700 and had my heart set on it, but got tired of waiting and got a TF300...around the time the TF700 release date was announced. So the TF300 went on the auction block and I bought this and a dock.\n\nBackstory out of the way, I can give a review that compares all three of Asus' best tablet offerings, where they apply:\n\nHow I use it: I use my tablet mostly for music, movies/Netflix, games, taking notes at school, and reading when I can find the time. The tablet comes out of the box with plenty of apps to satisfy almost all of these. The Polaris Office, My Library, and MyNet app are the only two \"bloatware\" apps I find worth having, as they are full of great features and free from Asus. I did replace Polaris Office with Kingsoft Office, as it has a word count feature that all college students need, but Polaris is great for those that don't need such things.\n\nDisplay: What can really be said here? 1920x1200 is enough resolution for anyone in this world on a 10\" tablet. Yes, I've played with the iPad with Retina Display my girlfriend has, and it's sharp, but the difference is hardly noticeable, and, if anything, mine has better picture simply because it's a 16:10 aspect ratio. The brightness goes to the same level of the TF201 (readable with the sun beaming on it), which leaves the TF300 in the dust because it isn't Super IPS+.\n\nPerformance: This is where things go South for our hero, a bit. I had the smoothest performance out of the TF201 and TF300 tablets (zero lag between screens with widgets and live wallpapers), while the TF700 has stutters here and there using the stock Asus Day Scene live wallpaper. I'm going to blame this on two things: one, the resolution is ridiculous, causing it to strain the processor momentarily from idle; and two, the flash memory in the entire TF line is SLOW! This fact is well documented at XDA Developers, if you'd like to read up on it. The slowest documented is 0.2 MB/s (that's 200 KB/s). The tablet also hangs when rotating on a home screen. The length varies by wallpaper type and number of widgets. Luckily, the hangs only seem to happen to me on home screens, because graphically heavy apps like GTA III/Vice City run smoothly in Balanced mode and with only slight stutters in Power Saver mode (running the thing entirely in performance mode ALMOST gets rid of all the hiccups).\n\nBattery Life: If you put the TF700 and iPad 3/4 in a \"staring contest\", the TF700 will win. I've easily gotten 10 hours out of this thing with the screen brightness at about 40% and heavy app usage. The TF201 and TF300 will obviously get a little better than this, due to the slower processor speeds and screen resolutions, but 10 hours on an HD display is killer! It only gets better with the dock, as others have mentioned.\n\nThe Look: Typically, I won't review how a piece of technology looks, because I like practicality over style seven days a week, but this tablet is d*** slick! The \"gray\", yes, it looks purple, but it's not a tacky look like the colors of the new iPod Touches. It fits the tablet well. The thinness of the tablet is worth mentioning too; while slightly thicker than the TF201 (and I mean BARELY) it's the same thickness as my Galaxy SIII, which is one of the thinnest smartphones on the market. Also, there are those that say the TF201 dock and TF500/700 dock is a slightly different shade of \"gray\", but I don't notice this looking at them both side by side. So if you're looking for a dock, get the TF201 dock as it has a bigger battery inside.\n\nOverall: After six months, I rate the Infinity Pad a 4.25/5 (can't do parts of stars, boo Amazon). The .75 is lost in the performance category alone, which is something I'm sure Asus will be working on with a potential TF800 tablet."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "The Asus Transformer Infinity... I like it.\n\nThe Asus TF700 offers a robust tablet that has style and substance. There are some things, hardware wise, that a prospective buyer should be aware of however. Nevertheless the TF700 is a very good device even though some of the draw backs may leave some users wanting.\n\nThere is no doubt that it is fast with its Tegra 3 processor. Applications open fast and you are sure that you can run the latest and greatest games without a hint of performance issues. There are only a few app that are optimized for the caliber of the Tegra 3 processor though.\n\nThe screen is beautiful with its HD display. High-res movies are a pleasure to watch and the cranked up Super IPS plus display enables that experience to be taken outdoors. The coating on the Gorilla Glass display enables your finger to glide across the screen but as always, you will leave finger prints that you would have to wipe off from time to time.\n\nThe TF700 is also very light and doesn't cause hand fatigue when holding it for long periods.\n\nThe sound the Infinity produces is `ok' at best. You are not going to be rocking to loud audio with this device. You're going to hear what you need to hear but don't expect much from its speakers.\n\nUsing the front camera for chatting is a standard experience. The rear 8MP camera can give nice HD videos but still images are not as good. Images can appear cloudy and grainy when zoomed in.\n\nIt would have been good to see newer technology like NFC included with the TF700. But the absence is not a deal breaker.\n\n*BUYERS BEWARE*\nIt seems that the tablet version of Android is a completely different OS. Android on Phones now matches IOS with its buttery smoothness but the same cannot be said for the Tablet versions of Android. Without adding widgets you may get that smooth transition as you would get on an android phone. But after filling the screens with widgets, performance can become choppy. Lags become very noticeable and mainly because of Asus' decision to have only 1Gb of RAM onboard. When opening the settings>apps>running you will see that the device already uses about 80% of the memory without opening any apps. Any PC builder knows that more memory equals better performance. With the Asus TF700, you may have to compromise.\n\nOverall the Asus Transformer Infinity is a good device that has only one major short coming which is its 1Gb of RAM. Anyone considering a purchase of this may want to consider alternatives before making a decision. But if you think that this is a great buy then make the purchase, you will be getting a top quality tablet that may meet or exceed your needs."}

Great screen resolution, great storage expansion options, the optional keyboard, quad core processor, and modern Android OS made it an easy choice for me, even over the Nexus 10.\n\nI wish it had more RAM.  1GB is my bottleneck when trying to run large apps, edit large documents, or task switch quickly between multiple apps.  In fact, the lack of RAM makes this tablet utterly useless when trying to do normal tasks with something running in the background.  Android's biggest advantage over IOS is its multi-tasking, but this tablet can't handle it.\n\nSpeaking of which, the Android OS is still not mature enough for me to consider it for long-term productivity work.  Problems with the built-in google chat client have caused me to nearly abandon IMing on the tablet completely [edit: after owning this for 9 months, I can say I haven't IMed from it in the last 6 months].  Switching tasks will sometimes crash the tablet and force a hard reboot, and during software updates (especially with only 1GB of RAM to work with) the tablet is unusable.\n\nThe memory is where Asus dropped the ball, but I can't fault them for Android being kind of crappy sometimes.  3/5 because of the issues with the lack of RAM making it more frustrating than helpful."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "Before we begin, I just want to make it clear that the 1-Star rating for this product is directed more towards the manufacturer (ASUS), and not so much towards the product itself. If ever I receive a replacement device that does not exhibit the issues that the last two did, I'll update this rating / review accordingly. However, considering the fact that I have little to no confidence in ASUS's QA, I'm not holding my breath..\n\nI'm not going to go into a ton of detail here, much as already been written here concerning specs and such. Suffice it to say, Transformer Pad Infinity TF700T is packing some serious hardware, and continues to be a force to be reckoned with.\n\nPro's\nThe Tegra-3 processor is a beast, and the inclusion of DDR3 RAM helps to improve overall speed. The HD display, while not as dense as those found on the newest iPads and Nexus 10, is incredibly bright (IPS+ Mode) with good color reproduction and contrast. Sitting side by side with an iPad 4, it's difficult to see any difference in display resolution. The addition of HDMI and Micro SD memory expansion ports on the tablet itself is a great touch. Additional memory expansion can be found on the keyboard dock which is sold separately. The build of the device is also top notch - \"mostly\" metal and Gorilla Glass 2. It's incredibly thin and relatively light, although the edges are probably a little too sharp for my liking. Battery life is also very good, especially when connected to the keyboard dock.\n\nCons\nUnfortunately, even a fast quad-core processor, DDR3 RAM, and Jelly Bean can't seem to remedy the frequent bouts of sluggishness this tablet suffers from. I'm assuming that the hardware is having a tough time keeping up with the high resolution display. I mean, that's a ton of pixels to push around, but still I would have expected better performance. While the DDR3 RAM is fast, there's simply not enough of it. 1GB is simply not cutting it. The Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 seems to benefit greatly from the inclusion of 2GB of RAM, and that tablet uses a significantly lower resolution display. Hopefully, ASUS will include 2GB of DDR3 RAM in the next iteration of this line of tablets. Other than the sluggishness, there's really not much this thing can't do.\n\nQuality\nUgh. Just, ugh. There seems to be a serious lack of quality control when it comes to ASUS products, and it certainly shows here. I've gone through two of these units from a big-box retailer, and a third one from Amazon. All three have suffered from a hideous amount of light bleed and dead pixels. To make matters worse, they've all come out of the box (brand new) with nicks, scuffs, and scratches all over the metal body of the tablet. I can handle a tiny scuff here and there, but deep nicks are just completely unacceptable. Honestly, is it asking for too much to get a unit that doesn't look like it sat in a room for an hour with a toddler and a fork? Also, the light bleed! While it may be too subtle to notice when browsing the web, they look like spotlights when watching a dark movie, or reading an eBook in night mode. Honestly, it's enough to drive someone up the wall after a while. ASUS needs to double-down on its quality control, because it absolutely sucks.."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I love this thing. It came loaded with Jelly Bean and all kinds of Asus stuff.\nJelly Bean is a wonderful improvement to ICS. I still have ICS on my Sprint EVO 3D and I still love it, but Jelly Bean is smoother (also because the TF700 is way faster) and more intuitive.\nThe tablet came with a bunch of ASUS bloatware, but that is easily disabled via the application info screens. The internet browser it comes with was OK at first, but for some reason it started getting REALLY slow. I suppose the cache fills up pretty quickly. I just disabled it and got Firefox with Ad Block Plus (no ads! best add on ever!).\nThe TF700 screen is incredible. SUPER bright. Readable in broad daylight, unlike a lot of LCD/LED screens. This is thanks to the Super IPS+ option. It does use a lot of battery, but it really helps in daylight like walking around campus or sitting in the quad.\nBattery...I have to charge it at the end of everyday, but I use it a lot. There are some days I don't use it at all and pick it up and it's dead..but then I realize I left the WiFi on (which is easily disabled when the screen is off) and it drained the battery. NBD, mostly my fault. The cool thing about this tablet is the ASUS options for power saving and performance mode. Power saving options like turning of GPS (oh yeah, it has GPS. Freakin' sweet!) and other things to save on power is crucial.\nBe wary though. I'm a total Android Fanboy and I HATE apple products. Than being said, this is probably the coolest piece of hardware I've owned...and I build gaming PCs. lawl.\nI'm not really hip on what other tablets have to offer, but I know (from reading other reviews and tech sites) that this is probably the best Android Tablet on the market as of 2/5/13 and if that interests you, then get it already!"}

I had the 1st generation iPad and I remember not really being all that impressed with it, because in so many ways it reminded me of an over-sized iPod Touch.  So skip two years and I'm back looking at tablets.  What really sold me on the Infinity was the fact that it \"Transforms\" easily into a sleek netbook with a touch screen.  Sure most tablets allow you to use an often cheep looking keyboard, via bluetooth with them, that really aren't worth the money you pay for them. However with the Infinity, the tablet attaches nicely to the keyboard dock. Oh and let's not forget the additional battery power that comes along with the keyboard dock. Where else can you go and get an average of 16 hours of constant use on a tablet? As cheesy as this may sound... it's pretty awesome, because I don't find myself running to the charger every few hours, let along daily.  I will admit that I am a droid phone user, so the familiarity with the Android Platform was definitely a plus."}

This time with a horizontal white line running across the screen (in landscape mode).  This line never disappeared after restarting it several times.  I also noticed that where the sd card slot is the screen depresses noticeably and makes a little creek sound.  I am chalking all this up to this being a defective unit and did return it.

I had done a lot of research on which tablet  to buy and settled on the tf700 because of a very good price-to-value point. I was looking for something which is good for everyday consumption (for family, I don't get a chance on it :) ), and won't break the bank. This left out the ipad (among other things, no extra ports, very high price etc). As such, I limited myself to an android os and compared a lot between the acer, toshiba as well as the tf300. After reading a lot of reviews, I settled on the tf700 primarily for its nice screen (one could go for the tf300 also but back-to-back, this just looked nicer :), thin case and low heat : we run it continuously and barely notice any warmth)  It has a nice brilliant hd screen, very good battery life and is very responsive. We primarily use it for netflix, youtube, browsing, skype  and a few games and it works very smoothly.  The wi-fi speed is excellent and so is gps lock.\n\nAs a BIG bonus, the tablet comes with an hdmi out which allows me to stream netflix, and other web-content to our HD tv,  We haven't used too much content other than this, so can't comment on that, but in general the android environment seems to have a very reasonable set of applications that we use.  On the hardware side, we use the front facing camera for video calls but haven't used the actual camera.\n\nOverall, highly satisfied with the purchase."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "Before I get to the product review - ASUS (contrary to their advertisement on this product) will not provide one year accidental damage support like their advertisement states.  They say they offer no coverage on this unit for that.  Why do they then advertise it that way you ask??? Good question, I reply.  I purchased this tablet influenced in large part because of the fraudulent advertisement for this guarantee thinking AH HAH, protection from my little mayhem generating monsters!  Not so much...  When my then 8 year old managed to find a way to try to use the tablet as a shot-put and finally cracked the screen (surprised? nah, not here...), I said, AH HAH, thank God, I have that protection (see advertisement under \"Reliability Matters\", Paragraph 2, Sentence 3 which states \"In addition, ASUS also offers the industry's best-in-class warranty and free 1-year accidental damage protection so you sleep worry-free knowing ASUS' got your back.\"  \"Uh-huh, yes-sir , whats that?  Oh, you don't???, but that's what the ad says, yes, please read it, right here. Im sorry there IS no supervisor???..\"  Apparently the sentence was supposed to read \"In addition, ASUS also offers someone else the industry's best-in-class warranty and free 1-year accidental damage protection so you sleep worry-free not knowing ASUS' will stab you in the back.\"  And please ASUS if you are reading this don't try to tell me that this was just one person because I tried on several occasions over a few weeks with different individuals and got the same line each time.  You have put out a sickeningly deceitful advertisement for this product and you should be taken to task for this.  BIG KUDOS TO AMAZON THOUGH- THEY AGREED WITH ME WHEN I CALLED THEM AND THEY RETURNED THE PRODUCT THEMSELVES FOR A FULL REFUND.\n\nNow, on to my brief and succinct product review.  Product is generally okay, although it generally cant be substituted successfully for a shot-put and reused.  I have actually repurchased this unit because its the closest thing to what I am looking for that I can find on the market.  Graphics are nice, OS is greatly improved with firmware improvements since the original version shipped.  Still buggy at times.  Two biggest complaints?  1.  Battery life - nine hours...on which planet would that be? Its not here at least in the southeastern portion of North America.  Now that I have two of them, I can say neither of them really approach half of that at best, with all recommendations on battery life followed.  Maybe they meant when its not in use.  2.  Product support - plain and simple, what was once a respectable company for many years now just sucks.  I have been purchasing motherboards exclusively from them for over 10 years now I think.  Its hard to even find a phone number any more for support on their products.  Their support is now in some very difficult to understand grammatical dialect of English that reminds me reminiscently of many of my engineering school professors from College.  Hello....Remember us??? The Customer???  We put you where you are today???  You are working hard to make Apple more appealing to me, but I digress.  Yes, I know, shame on me for purchasing another product from a company that I believe has a sense of ethical morality on par with Bill Clinton.  Long story short?  If you can in general overlook those two items, its an okay tablet."}

Since I have many apps on my Droid Razr it was easy to send them all to the tablet, I was very happy to see I did not have to buy them all over again.  The two things that I do not like and was not aware of is one the cable connector is not a mini usb and two it takes a 15 volt charger.  Do not expect to use all those USB wall chargers laying around the house, they do not work.  Well they work but very very slowly and the battery icon will not show it is being charged.

Now I have to always use the audio jack to listen to anything from the tab.\n\nCalled the tech support and they straight away asked me to factory restore the tab. I had to ask multiple questions to know that this would also delete the music, photos, etc that I have in the internal storage. I was glad I asked those questions. Otherwise it would be gone forever. It would be better if the rep. would warn the consequence to everyone and not only for the ones who ask too many questions.\n\nAfter the factory restore, the speaker still wouldnt work. Now I am sending them the tab for them to look at. If the speaker doesnt work for hardware reasons, this is indicative of issues with durability and quality of ASUS products. This tab is just 6 months old. When you pay big bucks to get this tab, it ought to last several years before running into such issues.\n\nIt seems there is no extra warranty that will make all of shipping free. Currently I have to pay out of pocket to send it to them. Return shipping is supposed to be free. It would be good to have a warranty plan that can be bought where the customer doesnt have to pay a dime to service/repair.\n\nUntil this happened, I was pretty happy with the tab. The display is gorgeous and the quad-core tegra makes it zippy. I really started liking it when this happened and threw a wrench on the ASUS brand.\n\nI am now sending the tab for servicing. Lets see how it turns out. Will update the post based on my service experiences.\n\nUpdate: I got the tablet back. The speaker is working now. Pretty sleek customer service. Paid to send it and free shipping back. However, I do have another problem. The micro SD card I used to have is no longer detected. And when it detects, it doesnt show up in the file manager.

I now get to enjoy my TV episodes, movies, games, and yes, even my Excel and Word files I bring home from work. My previous Tablets were the Ipad2 & the ASUS TF101 which I also loved, but I wanted the Quad core and Hi-Res of the TF700. WOW! I'm in love all over again!\n\nFor storage I'm using a 64gb microSDXC card for the Tab and a 64gb SDXC 133x card for the dock. It's not necessary to go that high or that fast for some users out there, but I find that it makes for quick access & response times when saving files to the removable SD cards and provides zero lag when playing back Hi-Res video as often as I do. To each his own.\n\nI have not experienced any crashes, reboots, black lines on the screen, or missing pixels, and only the rarest of force closures. By the way, I am rooted, which was super easy to do (less than 15min), but it's not unlocked. This is not an endorsement for rooting, nor does rooting violate the Mfr warranty when rooting can be easily reversed & restored via the Voodoo OTA RootKeeper app avail thru the play store. However, unlocking does violate the warranty & blocks you from receiving OTA updates.  I have still received three OTA updates from ASUS in the last 5 wks since I have had this, all while being rooted. The latest was JB10.4.4.25. Thank you to ASUS for their continuous support & improvement of their products.\n\nThe Wifi & GPS reception is full & strong from a distance of more than 50ft away from my ATT router when I'm outside lounging on the back patio.  The battery drains & recharges differently on the TF700 when docked than it did with my TF101, which took a little getting used to for me, I admit. But it still recharges quickly. The TF700 has awesome features and settings for prolonging battery life between charges. When combined with Juice Defender it's even better. The battery life is at about 7-9hr undocked and an additional 5-6hr when docked depending on continuous use vs sporadic use and a prior clean full AC charge. And also depending upon your power saving settings. Explore the many options avail in the system settings to see what best suits your needs and usage. Because I use the Tab daily I recharge overnite. I program in the settings not to push email, app updates, or any notifications between the hrs of 11pm & 6am. But once 6am rolls around the Tab comes to life and starts sounding off like a happy R2D2 with all sorts of email downloads & app update notifications. It's like having my very own alarm clock, only better. So far I have never not made it thru a full day without plenty of charge left on the Tab. But then I keep it docked most of the time, where it recharges itself whenever it needs to. However, I did need to fully drain & recharge the Tab & dock 3x over the first few days, before experiencing the long battery life from each, like the user manual suggests.\n\nI also get great Blue Tooth reception for my hands-free BT device, & my DBEST PS4003 BT stereo speakers for extra volume when I'm watching videos, movies, or even games. And great tether reception and Internet connection thru my Inspire 4g phone for on-the-road Internet access. I just turn on both the Mobile network & Wifi Hotspot connections on the phone, I turn on the Tablets Wifi connection in settings, more, Tethering & portable hotspot, and you should see your phones device name there. Click on it, wait a few seconds till they sync with each other, enter the security access code into the Tablet that is displayed on the phone screen, hit OK on the phone to accept the connection, and you've got instant Internet access thru the Tablet via the phone. This only has to be done once, for the very first time. After that, anytime I need Internet access thru the Tablet when away from home, I just click on the phones Mobile network & Wifi Hotspot from the quick access Taskbar,  the Tablets Wifi connection from the Tablets quick access taskbar, and they automatically pair up every time. Quick & easy.\n\nI transferred my 258 apps from the TF101 to the TF700 and all ported over flawlessly except 1 game, which was the app Mfr fault, not the Tablet. I wrote to the app Mfr and they said they are already in the process of updating the app to take advantage of the TF700's Higher Res. The app still works...it's just that it doesn't expand to the full screen size of the Tablet. (about 1/4\" shy of the Lft & Rt edge) That is the only prob I've had with any app not running or displaying correctly. There were 4 games with large data files that I attempted to restore but would force close on me. The problem was that the data was originally downloaded from the Mfr website after the play store installed the app. I had to delete the app & data, then allow the play store to re-install the app, and allow the app to re-download the data from the Mfr website. Then I used Titanium Backup to restore only the data for that app, in order to get my saved history back. Voila! I only had to do that for the 4 games where the data exceeded 100mb. I think it is because the play store & the Mfr website can place the app & the data in diff storage locations on your device, which can be specific to the make & model of your device. Your backup software can't always get it right when backing up your apps & data from one device then restoring it to another device. That was of no fault of the TF700.\n\nI experienced the same prob when porting my phone apps over to my TF101. Some apps had to be re-installed directly from the app store because there was a diff ver avail for the Tab than for the phone. Same when porting apps & data from one Tab to another because of the diff make, model, & storage locations of each device. It happened to me when restoring apps from my TF101 to the TF700 because of the Quad core capabilities of the TF700. The app store has diff vers of some apps that specifically take advantage of Quad core devices capabilities. (Riptide, ShadowGun, FieldRunners, Anomaly Warzone, Sentinel3 for example) Just a heads up for those who already have an android phone or Tab and are wondering if their old files will work on the TF700. They will. But for those apps that were enhanced to take advantage of the Quad core, you WILL have to download the enhanced ver of the app from the app store, then download the additional Mfr data from the Mfr website. Then you can try restoring only the data from your backup software for that app to get back your saved progress. I've been lucky with Titanium & My Backup Pro so far. And I have not lost any data progress in the transfer. And wait until you see the stunning graphic details of these enhanced apps on the TF700. AMAZING! Even many of the apps that have not been enhanced look sharper & more detailed thru the 1080p Res.\n\nI've read other user reviews where they speak of the proprietary USB cable, the weak sound output, the lack of 5g network access, the slow response from ASUS tech support personnel, etc. But in my experience the USB cable was never an issue for me even with my TF101 other than its length, which I easily remedied by ordering two 6FT 3.0 USB aftermarket Transformer cables thru Amazon. Or the sound volume, which is a vast improvement over the TF101 & the 201 series in my opinion. The standard vol is sufficient for most of my needs. But when I need more, I use my DBEST PS4003 mini rechargeable duo Blue Tooth speaker pair that puts out Loud vol & deep Bass for such small & easily portable speakers. I take them with me whenever I'm out & about. I've never had bad or slow Wifi reception at home even tho I do have a 5ghz connection and the Tab defaults to the 2.4ghz it's still fast for my needs. I'm not downloading huge files or P2P data thru my Tab even if it was capable of faster speeds. But that's just me. Luckily I have not had to contact ASUS for support via phone or online for any problems across my two ASUS Tabs in the past two yrs, so I cannot attest to their response time or lack there of.\n\nI know this is a bit long winded for a review, but there are a lot of people out there who may be put off about getting this Tab. After all of my research on the TF700 I wanted to share what I've learned from others in hopes that it saves them from having to surf the web for this info like I had to. There is a lot of mis-information about this Tablet. Everything I've learned about this Tablet is thru my own daily use of the TF700, the user reviews like mine here, and much thanks to the many user forums and expert reviewers out there that I read thru before I purchased my TF700. Definitely check for yourself to see what others have to say. It took some time for me to type all of this out but I thought it was worth it if it helps anyone out there who may be on the fence about the TF700. I hope I've touched on the main points that may be of concern to most readers. If I've left out something important or got something wrong I apologize in advance.\n\nI highly recommend this device to anyone interested in taking advantage of not only todays apps, but also the future apps that are sure to take advantage of the TF700s superior speed and Hi-Res capabilities in the months & years to come. With its strong Wifi & GPS connections, HiRes screen output for videos & games, the Quad core speed, the awesome battery life, and ease of tethering Internet access I have no complaints with this device. It is an absolute joy to take back & forth to work, or to play with, and all around fun. I get loads of compliments from friends who at first assume it's an Ipad. My old Ipad2 was no match for this. Not even close.\n\nUpdate as of 6-22-2013\nIt's been 6 months now and I love this Tablet even more than I did at first glance. After re-reading everything here in my initial review, the only correction is that I have now unlocked the Tablet and installed a Custom ROM (CROMI-Xenogenesis) from xda developers website which adds customize-ability to the Tablet as well as many other bells & whistles for ease-of-use. My initial concern was about the Tablets output volume. I was able to increase it significantly with an app called Bass Booster. I still use my DBEST BT speakers alot because of the awesome sound quality and output. But with regular use the Bass Booster app is enuf for my needs. I also upgraded the SD card from 64gb to a Lexar 128gb 400x card for more video storage and backup space. I have not dropped it because it doesn't slip from my hand. I have not experienced any bad pixels or light bleeds or the glass pulling away or separating near the corners. Nothing of that sort at all. I have zero complaints. The compliments never end as my friends & acquaintances see the Tablet docked and think that it's a Netbook until I separate them. Battery life is still amazing with no need to ever recharge before the day is over. When they see the Hi-Res display and the snappy response moving from app to app or surfing the Net they are always impressed. I absolutely love this Tablet with no regrets."}

But guess what... if you can't turn it on... it's USELESS!! I honestly don't understand how they could build such a great tablet, but provide such a god awful charger with it.  I mean seriously?!? what were the thinking?!? mine stopped working the second time I tried to use it.  I went online and found some trick to move the pins forward to get it working again, now pretty much every few days I sit there for an hour trying to get it working again.  You know why? because they charge $40 for a new charger, and it's the exact same piece of crap one that they give you with the tablet.  My recommendation is to stay away from this product until they redesign the charger, no joke it has ruined the majority of my experience with this tablet.  If you think this won't happen to you, just google it and see how many other people have had this problem.  It's definitely not just me; I wish I new about it before I wasted my money on this piece of junk.  Now I'm forced to drop another $40 on a new charger and hope I only have to fix it once every month instead of once a week.  If the second one breaks, I'm selling this tablet.  I'll follow-up on this review some time in the future and let you know how it turns out.  For now, take my advice and stay away from this one unless you have time to become a charger fixing expert."}

I haven't time the battery too carefully, but with moderate usage and without using the most stringent battery-saving settings (it was driving me nuts when it was going to sleep after only 30 seconds of non-use), I think the tablet lasts 8 to 9 hours and then I get another 8 to 9 hours from the (optional) keyboard.\n\nThe main criticism I have of this tablet is the lack of support for flash video and therefore its incompatibility with a lot of online video resources (YouTube works fine, but other video sites and video on many websites is problematic).  This can be remedied for the most part with the Skyfire browser app available from Google Play, but there are still some compatibility issues with video on some websites.\n\nOther than that, it is a nice tablet - sturdy-feeling metal case, nice screen resolution, front and rear camera, and good battery life."}

Most of my colleagues have ipads but there are several features of the transformer that make it a better choice for me: 1. Good battery life that is greatly extended when using the docking keyboard; 2. Nice memory that can be enhanced with micro SD cards (tablet) or by SD card and usb ports (keyboard); 3. good options for free and inexpensive android apps; 4. mini-HDmi port; 5. most importantly, the docking keyboard really makes this useful for detailed tasks - it is sturdy and fully functional, adds battery time, memory and usb ports.  Typing on the tablet screen is very easy, but the keyboard is SO much easier for long documents or for remote accessing your office computer.\n\nThe Transformer screen is a very nice size and quite durable. The tablet itself is thin and light and you can use it separately from the keyboard for most tasks.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I bought the Asus Transfomer Pad Infinity after reading all the positive reviews about this tablet on many \"tech\" websites and feeling a compelling need to get a tablet that would also function as a laptop (sort of). I expected nothing but the best when I read about all the ramblings about how this is a worthy competitor to the latest iPad. Unfortunately, the Infinity couldn't even beat my iPad 2 when it\ncame to performance. True, it has a fabulous display, it's loaded with irresistible features and the keyboard dock even adds a USB port and an SD card slot, but think of it like this- what's the point of a fully equipped luxury car that drives like a truck?\n  The performance of the Asus is abysmal. More often than not, I had to close down the browser because it wouldn't respond. I have to constantly make use of the Task Killer and the Fast Reboot Apps to keep the performance optimal. The tablet cannot handle more than 2 apps in the background without becoming choppy. With the keyboard connected, it's not possible to watch YouTube videos in fullscreen. That might be an app glitch and soon be resolved but there's no forgiving the dismal battery life when using the tablet by itself.\n  If you open more than 2 tabs on the browser, or run more than 2 apps in the background, or try to browse the web while updating your apps, the tablet runs out of breath.\nIf you really want a tablet-netbook, I suggest you wait until they launch one with atleast a 2GB RAM and a quad-core processor."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I've had a TF101 for years now and have really liked it. After a huge disappointment with the Adam Tablet, I found the TF101, with base, and fell in love! It was about perfect! I got a great deal of use out of it as an all round reader, movie watcher, music, internet device. I used it all the time. Many versions later, I decided it was time to upgrade, and there was the TF700. I figured it would be the same, but better. I was wrong.\n\nWhat I had forgotten was all those months of instability with the TF101. It has been a long time since those days of random crashes, reboots, incompatibilities. With the TF700, it has far less of those issues than the TF101 had when it was first released, however, it has an order of magnitude (loads) more than the current TF101.\n\nThe most damning aspect of this \"updated\" device is the reduced form factor. First, and foremost to me, is this newer Transformer only has ONE SPEAKER! And it's a weak bugger! It's very noticeable, and makes watching videos pretty useless. Where the TF101 had stereo sound and louder much nicer sounding (more base perhaps?) speakers. I gave purchased a set of self-powered speakers to compliment this product, however, it is far too incontinent to carry them around with me. Perhaps, if they really needed to, they should have moved them into the optional base. Either way, I'd prefer the device had stayed the same size as the 101, if it meant better audio.\n\nThe buttons are the other major new form factor failure. They have moved them from the top of the tablet, in portrait mode, to the top in landscape mode. Typically I only really use this device, in hand, when using it as a reader (book or internet), which is in portrait mode. The buttons then are at the very top, and bottom, so, depending upon your orientation, your hand is on the power button, or on the volume buttons, and you WILL accidentally press them. I had never had this problem with the TF101.\n\nWhere they have reduced the size of the form factor over the TF101, and substantially improved the processing power, if only in number of cores, and improved resolution, they have lost the slick form factor, and years of improved driver and product support. In the end, the processor power and resolution improvement is unnoticeable, as few applications take advantage of this (preferring to targeting lower end tablet and phones). Some times I -think- I can see the improved performance, and resolution (like when zooming), though the performance stalls a lot (like when browsing with the native browser), however, I can most definitely hear the changes, and feel them when my volume suddenly drops, or the power goes off, from coincidentally pressing those buttons. In the end I don't mind lack of application utilization of the new advantages of this TF700, what I do mind is the reduced form factor, making me regret this purchase and wish to even return to my TF101, which I had sold too soon (immediately upon buying this TF700)."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "The Transformer Infinity is very nearly perfect in most ways. It's super-light and thin, while having the power and flexibility to (with the keyboard attachment) entirely displace any ultraportable-type laptop.\n\nThe screen is very clear and extremely bright. The keyboard attachment is comfortable to type on, and holds it upright on a table just fine, without any tendency to tip back like older Transformer models were prone to do. The ports are convenient-- I especially like that I can plug in an external USB mouse and it just works. The OS and system software are very nice, running close-to-stock Android with only a few modifications that actually make the interface better, but can still be turned off if you want a VERY stock-like experience. ASUS doesn't lard up their system with shovelware the way the phone manufacturers tend to.\n\nThere are a few flaws, though. The top buttons feel a bit cheap and press very easily, occasionally leading to accidental locks when I bump the train seat in front of me. The screen glass is very glossy. It shows reflections enough to sometimes make it hard to work in bright lit areas, despite how bright the screen itself is. Finally, the Tegra graphics drivers seem to be a bit unstable, producing the occasional crash (maybe once or twice a day under heavy usage) when rotating the screen or launching an accelerated game.\n\nFlaws notwithstanding, I heartily recommend this product."}

I haven't had a chance to thoroughly use all the features - such as camera and video recording but I have a pretty good sense of the device. The reason I did not give it a five star review is because sometimes there is lag - for example after unlocking - but other than that it is indeed very, very fast, has good hardware materials, and excellent battery life.\n\nPros:\n- Excellent screen resolution - text is very sharp\n- Durable hardware materials - aluminum chassis is great, and the champagne color looks awesome\n- Upgradeable to Jelly Bean out of the box\n- Great amount of storage, and expandable by 32gb micro sd card\n- Good price point considering all its features\n- Excellent battery life - I tend to lower the brightness significantly due to personal preference\n- Watching HD netflix movies on the 10\" screen is great - the size is just right\n- This depends on personal preference, but I find reading ebooks on it very comfortable. I thought it would be too big and heavy compared to a kindle, but it really works just fine for this function\n\nCons:\n- Sometimes lags after unlocking - probably because it's updating widgets (certainly not a deal breaker)\n- On mine the top two corners of glass must not be set completely or completely adhered to the unibody chassis because when I push on them I can feel the glass move a little and here a noise - probably a quality issue. Annoying, but not so much for me to return it (my hands aren't in those areas enough for me to care too much)\n\nOverall - very much worth the money and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a top of the line general purpose Android tablet"}

So I had been using this on 30 seconds and it's jacked up. So I called right away and they said \" I am Sorry\" send it in for service ! Really $500+ for this and all this fun. In my calls to their call center I would ask for a supervisor , the first time I did get to one I though this is not right , the person sounded like a computer voice, so I asked for someone else and it said , no one else is availiable ? I hung up . The next day I called back and asked for a supervisor and got the same. So I guess you really do not get a different person, just the same joker type comands into their PC to talk to you. I was and still are upset about all of this. So I searched the web for USA phone numbers and did get to a \"Live Manager \" and he assured me I could trust him and he would get me an Unused and completely check ed for defects and would send out as soon as I returned the other. Well here I sit with the information just sent to me that I am getting the same 30 second defective tablet back.  So I do not know my hext step , but yours should be stay away from this tablet and Stay away from Asus . I am screwed out of $500 + Dollars , Please don't let the same thing happen to you. I did not research for the bad stuff on this tablet and Asus before I bought it , only for the good stuff about it. I sure wish Amazon could help me out , They are a stand up company, but they should not sell Asus products."}

The tech people in Best Buy concluded that there must have been something wrong with the pins where you connect the keyboard dock (and the charger plug-in).\n\nI've had my tablet for about a week now, and I am really enjoying it. I don't know a lot about computer stuff so I won't comment on that, but everything seems to work fine. The one complaint I have is about the speaker. Some apps only display a certain way (you can't rotate them), which means you are forced to hold the tablet with the speaker at the bottom. This muffles the sound. I wish the speaker were on the other side or that these apps were able to rotate.\nUPDATE: I ended up returning my tablet because of a defect. I bought the matching keyboard dock to go with it, but it didn't work. After spending hours in Best Buy while they tried to fix the problem, they concluded that the only possibility was that there was a defect in the pins/port where you plug the tablet up (not sure if that's the right word).\nAnother thing I noticed is that sometimes the tablet would freeze up. On a couple of occasions, the screen turned completely white ad wouldn't shut down for  a while, even when the power button was held down. I don't know if that was the tablet's fault or if it was a virus or something (I don't know how all of that works). It had a LOT of issues with the game app called Tiny Bird.\nAnyway, these occurrences were not very frequent, but they are worrisome. I'm glad I ended up having to return it bc I ended up getting a small touchscreen laptop with WIndows 8 instead, which offers a lot of tablet-like features, but still runs like a computer (I can have normal versions of Word and OneNote, etc)."}

Here we are in the new year and I am returning a unit to ASUS.  We have been on cordial terms with each other but the process is slow.  I have mailed everything as soon as I had labels and ASUS started paying for return shipping after the second bad unit.\n\nThe issue here for me is that the life cycle of tablets is short, two years or so and there is something much better available.  If you need a tablet because of a visual problem, or work with them on a professional basis then a RMA cycle of months is not acceptable.  When the TF700 comes back it will be compared to the Nexus 10 which seems to be a very nice product indeed with a consumer who bought a competitors (Samsung) product earlier than he would have.\n\nmore later"}

It was more expensive than others but it also promised to deliver a better tablet experience. I noticed right away that the screen would flicker. I had the same problem with my Galaxy and had to turn off the auto-brightness, so I turned off the auto-brightness. This did not solve the screen flickering problem. I performed a factory reset (the Asus standard fix suggestion) with no results. I opened a ticket with Asus and sent my tablet in for \"repair\". I received the tablet back with no explanation of what was fixed. Customer service is quite lacking. A few weeks later the screen began flickering again. I'm not sure whether I'll send it in again or just live with it...\n\nAlso the on-screen keyboard is horrible! It's almost unusable with key errors (double characters, wrong characters ex. press the space and get an \"n\").

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "So I received my tablet after fighting in BestBuy. Here I brought home the tablet I thought was best on the market and believe me it is NOT!\n\nPros: Fast CPU, everything running fast and very smooth. Finishing touch on the tablet is high class, the feel is perfect. Asus 4.1 is not the latest version of Android but it is very very close! Flash is also a big pro, compared to the TF300 at least. Triumph over Nexus 10 and 7 thanks to its supporting MicroSD card so you can easily upgrade your storage with affordable price, the ease of transferring your files, and you don't have to put yourself on the cloud like you have to with the iPad. So MicroSD is probably the biggest pro. One more pro over the Samsung competitors is that you have the option to turn the tablet into a netbook with physical keyboard and extra battery life!\n\nCons: I didn't think it would be a con, but the aluminum back cover is a con! Extremely easy to be scratched doesn't help. And the charging port is also aluminum. And the aluminum \"bar\" is extremely easy to be bent! I charged my tablet while it was on the shelf with the wire hanging and a day later I found that \"bar\" in a V shape! (Should have known better and buy extra warranty at this point!\" After a few time of bending and try to bend it back, the port is completely broken! Won't charge anymore and I saw my tablet die after its battery ran out. Then while I was trying to contact Asus for repairing. Two day later, I pull out the tablet after leaving it lying on the floor and I found a crack between the camera hole and the flash light. Either something happened that cracked it without me knowing, or I suspect the aluminum part shrink due to the cold weather, much faster than the carbon fiber part on top thus corrupting the top part. The reason I think this is after I pulled it out, I found the aluminum back extremely cold while the carbon part only slightly cold.\nAnyway, the tablet is a bust for me. If you decide to buy the damn thing, make sure you buy extra warranty. But you might want to wait for the next generation of tablet. Asus has disappointed me big time! I will just put it on eBay to see if I can get any money back."}

But at the bottom of my heart I still wanted one of these becauseof the hardware (quad core, micro SD slot, screen resolution). As luck would have it a friend was interested in buying the Samsung so I took the opportunity to finally get my hands on the TF700.\n\nAfter a month or so with the tablet...I have to say that I am very happy with the experience overall. I had read a lot of reviews so knew what to expect going in. I did return the first one I received due to signifinant light bleed but the return was painless and the second one was almost perfect except for slight screen lift on the bottom left corner, which is considered normal according to Amazon 2nd tier customer support (but they said if it causes any problems they will honor a return since I have it noted on file).\n\nSo far have no major complaints other than having to get used to the battery life (had been spoilt going 5 days before having to charge now its abut 3 days!). Software updates have been so much faster than Samsung...currently waiting for 4.2 update. I am experiencing an issue that has been reported with 4.1 Jelly Bean on these devices which is that with the new screen refresh rate some of the apps have an occasional black line flicker across the screen.\n\nI am really enjoying reading news on the New York Times and BBC apps, and slowly transitioning from hard copies to reading books on the Kindle app. I'm not going to say much about the screen other than the fact it makes watching videos and movies an awesome experience. Find myself looking for reasons to find stuff to watch on YouTube!\n\nIf you are looking for a tablet in the Android space this would be a strong option and with the hardware the experience is only going to get better."}

As with all other mobile devices, you can't really do much productivity if you don't have data services. I suggest you invest in a portable 3g device modem (like alcatel or huawei) so you can check emails and maximize app usage on the go. If you like reading, the naturally big screen offers lots of space for ebooks. Its equipped with nvidia processor so 3d games should be cool though am not a fan of games so haven't tried. Typing can be a challenge for those with small hands since its a big tablet. I recommend downloading a thumb keyboard app in android store. That said, its not practical to work on editing word documents or spreadsheets but for read-only operation, it has polaris office preinstalled that can read such file types fairly well."}

There are hundreds of amazon reviews and dozens of professional ones so I'll just give a quick pros and cons list. So far I've enjoyed playing a lot of game apps and netflix works pretty damned well. I use the Poetic folio case witch is okay and an Init sleeve I got for $5 which I love. I'd say all said and done I'm out all of an additional $20 in accessories (not including the dock).\n\nPros:\nResolution is perfect for the apps in the store, don't get sucked in by the higher resolution tablets if it means losing out on other benefits you really want.\n\nI love having the low power consumption mode, it allows longer usage and a much much longer standby time.\n\nIt looks phenomenal, build quality/fit and finish is top notch. I get no light leaks around the edges and everyone I hand it to falls in love while holding it.\n\nConstant OS updates, I was on Jelly Bean a month after it came out and it isn't skinned to death. I have absolutely no longing to root or side-load a custom OS which was the experience I was hoping for.\n\nIt comes with Polaris productivity sweet, it's not perfect but it'll get you by in a pinch. If you actually need to do work with your tablet expect to buy a decent software package no matter what tablet you get.\n\nTHE DOCKING STATION...  I won't go into the docking station here but it is tremendous... just the fact that it's an option is a plus in my book. Best $100ish tablet upgrade ever!\n\nInternal 32gb\n\nMicro SD slot\n\nI have yet to not be able to run anything I want without a problem or any lag. I'm not saying there aren't any out there that could cause a problem I've just not come across any myself.\n\nCons:\nyou can't put it to sleep with a magnet in the cover like you can the ipad... that is a super nice feature and I really wish it was included. There are times you wonder if you remembered to put it to sleep or not before you closed the folio case.\n\nI really wish there were more accessories i.e. the folio and case options are pretty limited.\n\nThe speaker is horrible if you are any distance from it. I like to watch netflix in the kitchen while I cook and the speaker is just useless for that so the only solution is to get something external. when you are holding it the speaker is fine though.\n\nThe power port placement is a bit of a hassle. I have to set it up precariously to charge it while watching anything in landscape mode. The doc takes care of that but for the purposes of this review we'll assume you aren't getting it."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I've had this tablet for a month now and enjoy it very much most of the time.  I haven't had any issues with display, software, or performance, and have used it both as a standard tablet (usually for book reading) and as a netbook with the keyboard attachment for nearly everything else.  I love the fact that the keyboard has its own battery and extends the life by five hours or more.  The display is crisp and clean, the sound is great (even if the speakers are on the wrong side), and if you want to use your own mouse on the keyboard, the USB port is very handy...I was able to plug in a mouse dongle and use it right away.\n\nI only have three minor issues with the device:\n\n1) The available device covers make keyboard attachment difficult.  Since this device MUST be protected, I did research until I found the best available cover (caseen).  It's great and cut properly, but the keyboard is hard to get in and tends to unclip if you don't fasten it VERY securely.\n\n2) The tablet is considerably heavier than the keyboard, so if it is not on a hard, flat surface like a table, the tablet tends to fall over.  So it doesn't work very well as a true \"lap\"top, because it keeps tipping.\n\n3) Trying to type a paper on this machine is a bit of an ordeal.  When I'm typing a document, it's very hard not to hit the mousepad with your thumb, and every time I do, the cursor jumps randomly in the document.  There might be an app somewhere that can temporarily disable the mousepad, but I haven't seen it yet (and if there isn't one, there should be!)\n\nOverall, though, an excellent multi-purpose computer for the money, and one I'd recommend."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I have owned this since it came out. I am a college student that was looking to replace my laptop that had fried. Deciding between a netbook or a touch, I knew I made the right decisions after countless back and forth. It definitely took care of all the necessary stuff I needed for college. I am very dependent on frequent emails, writing assignments, and attaching/sending .pdf/word doc. files to my professors and classmates.\n\nI have put this thing through the test of almost anything I could think possible. I have to say, it endures and stays up to par very well.\n\nThe biggest factor to which brought me here to write this review is to warn people what has happened to my tablet just recently. On the tablet itself, there is the docking station inlet. In that inlet, there is a plastic piece to which the keyboard dock latches itself onto. The design to make this piece plastic was poorly placed, because after much inserting in and out of the dock and stress from pulling upward on screen or what have you, it broke. It then won't latch and stay firmly. But I did have a temporary solution and found a plastic piece which I cut to size since I could not find the original broken piece and super glued it there. Now stays on like new, but for how long? Granted, I did hold the tablet with the dock attached countless times. But even so, it is inevitable that one day, this part is prone to breaking on any Infinity owners that uses their docking station and travels with it a lot.\n\nMy mother has an iPad 4 and my brother has an iPad 4 to which I have used extensively. I will make a short comparison for those \"apple vs android\" tablet people out there. I am in no way bias towards any brand or manufacturer. I am simply a gadget loving person. Price and device functionality determines my choice.\n\nThe iPad and Infinity are both great devices. If I had to put it simple, the iPad is a great entertainment device where it excels in browsing and overall smoothness. The Infinity on the other hand, excel in functionality. I could do so much more with it. With the added dock, it just can't be beat. The iPad's dock is nothing in comparison to what the Infinity delivers. Added battery life and more netbook-like feel. Android, like any other software and programs out there, it isn't perfect. But it is definitely heading in the right direction compared to when I have last touched an android device a couple of years ago.\n\nI really could go on and on about this, but I feel that many of the other reviews have already done that and I just wanted to add in my own input. There will be sluggish moments on the Infinity. Browsing can be slightly laggy/sketchy, on start up from standby, it can be a bit slow and jumpy especially if it has not been touched for a while. I have experienced random reboots at least once a week (more on this, I feel that it does this because the RAM or cache is full, because after it does this, my tablet runs much smoother). Understand that I also load my tablet with A LOT of apps that sits in the background running. With this in mind, I believe this machine is a beast. If I had kept it standard, I know I would not be met with so many sluggish moments, force closings or random rebootings.\n\nOtherwise, this tablet is definitely a keeper for a very long time among the many gadgets I own. Not only that, but it's the one gadget I felt has served me my money's worth in the little time that I have owned it."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I want to state one thing about my review here - there are no perfect tablets on the market.  Not the iPad, the Nexus 10 or the Surface.  all ablets have their issues and limitations from my standpoint.  For my needs I wanted a device that was powerful enough for me to use as a laptop replacement when needed, flexible enough to fit a variety of usages, and simple enough that my 3 year old could use when needed.  The Asus TF700 fit all of these needs.\n\nThe TF700 features a Tegra 3 procesor along with 32G of storage space, which provides top of the notch performance while leaving enough for hundreds of apps (I currently have over 250 apps on my tablet, with 13 GB of space still free).  The device has expandable storage through Micro SD cards, something absent on the iPad and Nexus 10.  While the device does not utilize a standard Micro USB cable for charging like the nexus 10, it does feature a micro HDMi connection for connecting the tablet to an external monitor or TV.\n\nThe device runs smooth as \"butter\" after installing the jelly Bean update, which you will be prompted to do shortly after going through the initial set up.  Apps open quickly and navigation is excellent.  I do get the occassional slow downs, but they are definitely very, very few and far between.  I've seen similar hiccups with the Nexus 10 and iPad.  Surface is a whole different issue, with apps taking several seconds to open up (as much as 30 seconds in some cases).\n\nThe real plus witht eh Transformer series over all other tablets is the keyboard dock.  While there are several bluetooth keyboards and other input options for tablets, not are integrated and function as well as the Transformer's keyboard dock.  Now keep in mind that the transformer keyboard dock is not perfect, but again it is definitely the best out of all the options out there.\n\nSo unless you have to have the latest product that Apple tells you to buy, I thinlk that this tablet is the best way to go.  The Android app ecosystem is nowhere near as dismal as people try to make it out to be and the device's performance is second to none.  As a final point, games look amazing on this Tegra 3 device coupled with this fantastic screen."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "First of all, I am very computer savvy. I was very nervous about purchasig this tablet after reading the one star reviews and the issues other users have been having. Also, the reports I have been hearing about Asus's awful customer support from others wasn't helping either. When I finally made my purchase I read about the tablet pretty much non-stop until it arrived (I may have been a little obsessed) but this is how I make sure I get what I am looking for and that I get good quality products at a decent price. I received my tablet and so far there are no issues with it. I purchased the optional keyboard dock which is definitely worth the money. You can convert the tablet basically into a netbook like device and add upto an additional 4.5 hours of battery juice. It is unfortunate for those who have had issues with their tablets and I hope Asus will resolve any issues. For those of you who are having issues with your tablet here is an email address from an actual asus customer support representative. I found this email address on newegg's website from reading customer reviews there. The email address is cl-tien@asus.com and the person's name is Tien.\n\n***Read Below my extensive review why I purchased this tablet***\n\nBefore I purchased this tablet I did some extensive research on various tablets. I also read up on benchmarks for them within the specifications of what the Asus Transformer Inifity TF700T has. Some of these include the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1\", Ipad 3 and 4 (including those with retina), Samsusng Galaxy Tab 2 10.1, Google Nexus 7, Google Nexus 10. These other tablets have very nice specifications and I was thinking about getting the Nexus 7 or 10. The Ipads are too expensive for what I want (10\" and 64 gig). The thing that made me come back to this is the optional keyboard dock and the 1080p display screen. It's very rare to find a tablet that offers a dock that has a USB port, full size SD memory card slot and has an internal battery to offer an additional 4.5 hours of battery power on top of what the tablet's internal battery provides. The other nice thing about the full size usb port is that you can plug in a regular usb drive and have literally unlimited amount of storage space on a tablet. This is almost unheard of for many tablets. Sure, other tablets do have some kind of memory card slot and once they fill up you have to either clear some space or by another one. It's definitely cheaper to by a regular external harddrive than it is to continually buy memory cards.\n\nAsus also offers  a USB dongle accessory so you can plug usb drives into the tablet without the keyboard dock. You can plug PS3 and I heard xbox 360 controllers into this dongle and play games this way. I haven't tried it myself but I have seen Youtube videos of this. This tablet has very many features and is definitely reasonably priced.\n\nOne of the specs I came across that isn't really listed on any sites is that this tablet has a 12 core GPU (graphics processing unit) card. The Ipads have a 4 core GPU. On several benchmarks the Ipads had better scores but I think it's because the one thing they are good at is optimizing their OS for their devices. The android developers do have some improvements to make but overall they have done a pretty good job especially with Android 4.1Jelly Bean. The nice thing about Asus is that they provided a firmware update so that this tablet can get the latest Android OS and Asus is pretty quick about releasing updates. Just a side note Asus makes the Google Nexus 7.\n\nSpeaking of android market I haven't found anything that I couldn't run on this tablet yet. I needed a program to SSH into the server at work and I found a good free one (without ads) no problem. Worked like a charm and having the 10\" screen definitely helped to actually see.\n\nOverall I am very happy with my purchase and I would by another one if I had the extra money and if I had a reason to get another tablet."}

Reading other reviews, one concern seemed to be that the screen resolution on the ASUS was so good that not many games or apps were able to take advantage of it. To me, that's like saying that a car gets such good gas mileage that you would soon run out of places to which to travel! We have used the tablet around the house and have yet to travel anywhere with it. But around here, it has been great. The sync ability of the tablet puts me in contact with every PC we have in the house as well as our \"Smart\" phone. Haven't played with the camera or video but there is no reason to expect that those features would not work as expected. My wife is the primary user and she has taken to it quite naturally. I would whole-heartedly recommend the ASUS family of tablets to anyone. You won't be disappointed!"}

It is one of the best Tablets on the market.\n\nWhen I look for a tablet, I look for build quality, physical size, screen resolution, OS...all that stuff. The Android OS is the weak-point for this one. No I am not an Apple Fanboy, I have used every type of Tablet and smartphone known to mankind though. You know it, I know it, the Android's advantage is in the Affordability and customizability, NOT it's usability or its streamlining.\n\nThis Tablet (mine at least got the upgrade recently) is using JellyBean, one of the better versions of Android I've seen. Its thin and sexy, lightweight, and a beautiful screen. High resolution 1080p, which was important to me. I can see it easily in the daylight, better than any tablet I've ever used. Better than all 4 instances of the iPad. And the battery life is outstanding. 2.5 days of regular use. I use it for work and I use it for play. All day long.\n\nThe newer Samsung Note 10 is an excellent device, very similar in specs actually. But no 1080p resolution screen. And you can tell. And the battery life isn't as good, and screen isn't as readable out doors. But I do like the pen thing on the Samsung. The Amazon Kindle HD has a beautiful screen...but its ad supported...and I can't tolerate that. I would pay more money for one without ads, but they don't sell it that way.\n\nMy biggest frustration with this Tablet, is the lack of nice cases. Most of them are bulky from China and poor quality."}

Does not come with FLASH but I was able to add this on my own.\nThe included word handling software from ASUS leaves much to be desired, has limited editing capability, does not track changes in documents well and cutting and pasting on documents is a chore.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I recently purchased a TF700 as an upgrade to my TF101 pad.  I purchased the unit because of its improved display and processing.  This tablet does provide enhanced graphics over the TF101; however, ASUS has yet to include good sound quality in their tablets.  Also, the switch from the TF101 to the TF700 required that I purchase another docking station because the TF101 dock will not fit the TF700.  I believe that ASUS should have developed an adaptor that would allow the 101 dock to work with the 700 rather than requiring their customers to pay another $150.00 for a second docking unit.  ASUS also changed from a mini to a micro HDMI port that requires the user to buy another HDMI cable.\n\nI've experienced some problems with the apps on the tf700 also.  The Xfinity Player app stops everytime I use the micro HDMI link to my TV.  The video stops playing and gives me a message to disconnect the cable before it will resume playing.  This app works fine on the tf101.  ASUS has been of no help in trying to resolve this problem.  Their only answer is that it must be an app problem even though I use the same app on their 101 without any problem. I contacted Comcast regarding the problem and I was told that the message that I am getting is not an error message related to the app, but a message related to the unit's operating environment controlled by the operating system.  ASUS tech support refuses to even try to duplicate the problem or perform any analysis of the issue!!\n\nOverall I like the unit but do not recommend that anyone rush out and buy it as a replacement to the 101 or 300 unless you realy want the highr resolution.\n\nI'll end by noting that I have been an ASUS fan for years.  I've used their mother boards and other products to build my home computers and have always found those products to be of exceptional quality."}

At least as good as our iPad2.\n\nThe bad:\n1) Sound: the speakers are poorly place and the volume is very low. ASUS should examine the Kindle HD and see how sound should be handled. ASUS isn't alone here. It seems most tablets are designed with headphone use over speakers.\n2) The battery life is absolutely abysmal. I can literally watch the battery fall while casually browsing the internet. I removed all apps that might use battery power in the background, stop syncing accounts & still get only 4 to 5 hours out of it. The upside is that it charges quickly.\n3) The whole tablet sometimes just slows down and I have to reboot or kill running processes. I have a Google Nexus 7 with similar RAM and processor and it NEVER has this problem.\n4) WI-Fi. The TF700T right next to my Android phone & Nexus 7 will always have lesser signal strength unless very close to the router.\n5) Quality. Less than 2 months since my initial purchase and I have to send my second one back for repair. (Note:I have a quality protective case and it has never left the house. It is used considerably less than my Nexus 7.)\n5A) Return 1. The Bluetooth did not work right out of the box. ASUS tech support wanted me to return it to them for warranty repair. Luckily Amazon's 30 day return/replacement policy was still in effect. I had a new one from Amazon in a couple of days.\n5B) Return 2. The TF700T just crashed when I woke it from sleep. The lock screen appeared, the device became unresponsive and then just died. ASUS tech support couldn't do anything so I now have to ship to them for repairs. On my dime with an expected return in about 3 weeks.\n\nBottom line. I wished I had delayed the purchase and gone with the Google Nexus 10.\n\nUpdate 6/10/13\nI did receive the TF700 back from ASUS on time. However, within a couple of weeks the replacement unit died. ASUS tech support again wanted me to ship it back to them on my dime. I was also told that there was a good chance that the part would not be in stock and that it would need to be shipped from overseas. No replacement unit just wait until we get around to getting the part, fixing it, and sending it back. I complained enough that I got a supervisor who arranged for free shipping from ASUS and promised that if it could not be immediately repaired that a new TF700 would be sent out. Everything worked out and I received a new replacement unit within 10 days.\n\nThird time must have been the charm. This unit has performed flawlessly for over 6 months.  The pro/con points above still stand.\n1) The screen is amazing. I think it is better than our iPad2.\n2) Battery life is still so-so.\n3) With Android updates from ASUS the problem of the TF700 slowing down seems to have stopped.\n\nI should mention that the ability to add micro SD storage is a big plus. I have two cards: a 32 GB with music & a 64GB with video. Swapping up is very simple.\n\nI've been satisfied enough that I recently purchased the Dock. Without going into a review of it the dock allows extra battery life, the ability to plug in a USB flash drive or SD card and a full keyboard.\n\nAs it stands I'd give my current TF700T a full 5 stars but the initial returns and ASUS support drop it down."}

US Cellular salesperson told me that newer smart phones are now made so that one cannot \"tether\" 4g (wifi) connection to a tablet.  They have a 5 device wifi hot spot on sale for $29.99 (from $200) that will cost $25 a month for basic 4g connection if you need wifi where it is not available otherwise.  Part of the reason I bought this - mini laptop as well as a 10 inch tablet.

This is my second tablet (I had the TF101) and my mother had an ipad so I have had some experience with other tablets.  It is very slim and not as durable as the TF101 if dropped.  However the purchase includes a 1 year warranty card so it isn't much of a problem.  All the apps work amazingly and they have fixed the problem with Polaris docs that kept forcing the app to shut down.  That was really nice for me since I am a collage student and use this guy to take notes and anyone who has taken notes in class knows how frustrating it is to lose them.  The browser app does have problems on occasion, but they are more like faux problems where it thinks it isn't responding in which you just choose wait when it wants to force quit and it works fine.\nThe battery life is very good and easily lasts with all day use.  It does have the three different settings of performance (battery saver, regular, and performance).  I usually keep it on battery saver with the screen at full brightness, which is another thing has really improved along with the IPS+ which decreases reflection when out in the sun.  I know that there was some complaints about wifi issues but I have yet to experience any and I have had this tablet for a couple months now.\nThis tablet goes with me everywhere and since it is so thin, it fits easily in my purse and carries all the data I need.  Really comes in handy when talking to professors and needing to show them something or at a store to show comparative prices.\nI highly recommend this tablet, it is wonderful for just about everything and unlike many other tablets, I don't have anything that I think should really be changed on it.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I've never been one to confine myself to a closed ecosystem, so Kindle Fire, Nook, iPad, etc... aren't my cup of tea.  I cannot fairly compare this to them, but if Android is for you, only the Nexus series can possibly beat this, and honestly, they fall short too.  All hail the Transformer Infinity!\n\nWhile the Transformer series offers a lot of features, you only need to appreciate a few of them to fall in love.  For me the biggies are:\n\n* Absolutely amazing screen: 1080p, uber bright, great colors, and excellent viewing angles\n* 32GB onboard (I use every cloud offering, and 16GB just isn't enough)\n* up to 64GB in microSD capability (why have a HD tablet without room for HD media?) --note the card is flush when inserted\n* Jelly Bean!  You'll have a couple OTA updates to get you there, but it's there\n* vanilla android!\n* great design, which is kinda sexy\n\nOther features you may appreciate:\n\n* dock that adds keyboard, full SD, USB, and battery\n* solid GPS (unlike Transformer Prime)\n* compatibility with many Transformer Prime accessories\n* a couple cameras I've yet to use\n\nA couple minuses (not huge, but still there):\n\n* battery life could be better (though tweaks can help)\n* no 5ghz networking (kinda a bummer in a 2012 flagship device)\n* speaker is crap.  I just don't get 1080p HD video and not even bothering with stereo audio.\n* proprietary dock connector and 12v charging\n* limited 1080p app (especially game) support, leaving some (all EA apps it seam) apps unavailable\n\nSo what does this mean?  Well it's a great tablet, and since I value the expandability of microSD, even better than the Nexus 10.  I'll try the dock soon, but it's really just the icing on the cake if you're into that ability.  It's a great tablet based purely on it's screen and vanilla Android Jelly Bean."}

Recently I went to Europe for vacations and my nine hours companion at the plane was this tablet that allowed me to see four movies and not to be worried about how long the trip was. In fact in France and Spain I could access many hot spots that allowed me to be in contact with my family and friends using skype and some other messangers.\nThis Asus has become my partner, my companion anywhere I go. I purchased also the keypad and found a nice leather bag with handle and like I said it goes anywhere with me.

I had a problem with the machine that updating solved completely. I'm not techie so I have no idea what happened and why. But once that was solved the rest of it was a problem with the operator-ME. I think that because I am of a generation before computers, and waaay before tablets, that I completely overestimated my ability to learn how to use it. I think that this is a lovely and wonderful product. It may not have been the best choice at that time for me. But as I have slowly learned to use it I have discovered many capabilities that help me do what I want to do. My husband asked me recently if I wanted to sell it and get something else and I said no. I still think a few lessons would help me, and there are probably some great how to's online to do that, but I like to learn with a human present so I'll probably just keep at it. The tablet is beautiful and it is a great travel tool because the detachable keyboard folds up and creates a hard shell like a laptop cover. Which makes me feel much more secure about carrying it around. It's light and it's fast and it's gorgeous. I was wrong on a lot of levels and I wanted to say so. If you are at all used to tablets and even if you aren't it's a great product. If you aren't, buy it where they can help you learn it, or take some lessons. Then it won't take you so long to enjoy it. And if you don't get it right away, go flame it. You'll feel really dumb and you'll regret it and you won't be fair to a product that deserves good reviews. And there's a reason your mom told you if you didn't have something good to say, don't say anything at all. Which isn't completely true-you can do a decent review criticizing a product for problems without being a jerk about it. Anc crow tastes kinda yucky too, I promise. So, try this tablet-or whatever version is out there now. It's good. Really.\n\nOLD REVIEW. I WAS WRONG.\nI hate this product. I bought it because of all the stellar reviews. It is almost unusable. I heard how fast it was. It isn't. I heard it was easy to use. It isn't. I took it to a couple places that sell tablets to get help using it because I thought since I was new to tablets it was just the operator. They had trouble using it too. It looks real pretty but any time you want to try to use it the commands are cumbersome and hard to find.\nI don't know if I got a lemon or not, but sometimes it just hangs and flickers acts like its got a short and then its fine. I got it to write stories and be mobile with it and use it for putting pictures in my stories. Basically I can check my Facebook. My phone does that. I was so excited when it came, but I have used it very little.\nI haven't used android before, but the guys who tried it for me have. I used my I phone from the moment I got it easily. I have laptops and pc's and am self taught on auto-cad and excel and a whole lot more. But this has me stumped and frustrated. It was such a good idea. I love the attachable dock. I love the screen quality and that's about the only thing I love about it."}

It was small and in the corner but for as much as you pay for this thing a bubble in the glass is unacceptable. Amazon is great though. I asked them to replace it and they did. The next one had even worse issues than the first one. There was some light bleed with the screen. You could tell the screen wasn't attached to the \"shell\" well since it would move and click during normal use. 3 strikes and it was done. I wanted to like this device.

The screen is beautiful with high resolution and brightness. The keyboard is a fantastic accessory giving extra battery life and allowing increased productivity above and beyond the ipad. The system as a whole is more versatile than purchasing a google chrome book or a standalone tablet.\n\n...that's where my praise ends. theoretically, i could have received a lemon and my experience may not be the norm. that said there are numerous fatal flaws. the worst flaw is how the screen sits in the docking keyboard. there are 3 supporting rubber bumpers that prevent the screen from touching the keyboard. unfortunately, there is a large, unsupported gap at the corners that causes the device to lever and bend. this led to the screen to flexing independently from the bezel, causing a creaking sound. eventually all that creaking led to cracks in my screen. i'm currently returning it to get it repaired, but clearly this is a serious design flaw.\n\nthe second deal breaker, is the speed of web surfing. the experience is maddening with constant stuttering and lags. it really makes surfing the web unpleasant. the ipad is smooth adn seamless and even the web experience on my galaxy nexus is far superior. i eventually rooted the device and tried a number of custom mods including cleanrom. some of these mods improved the experience slightly, but it is still very frustrating.\n\nfinally, the apps just don't stand up. this may be a google problem, but even apps that exist often don't work with the asus tf700, including the economist, netflix, and flipboard.\n\nif you are getting this product mainly for a small \"netbook\" that has a keyboard for limited productivity and for watching movies, etc. then it's okay. but DEFINITELY buy a case that covers the screen bezel, or else it may break when attached to the keyboard. if i were to start again, i would go for the ipad and just add a bluetooth keyboard. perhaps my repairs with asus will go well. maybe i'll get a new model and find out that my experience was due to a lemon. but so far i've been disappointed."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I debated for a long time about getting a tablet. A couple years ago I'd have sworn that I'd never have one. I've been a laptop guy for a long time and love the PC, but it gets cumbersome some times. You can't do everything with a tablet that you can with a PC, but for most people it can fill most of your needs. Smart phones are nice but they're just to small for my eyes and big fingers. Besides, my view of cell phones is something to make calls with and talk on.\n\nThat said as I read and looked at different tablets, I realized the potential for their use. I've got issues with Apple and didn't want to go the ipad route for a number of reasons. I did some research on the new Windows tablets and I like the idea, but they've got a way to go. I think they rushed it to get it to market. I like the ideas behind Android and although a lot of the apps are designed more for smart phones, apps optimized for tablets are increasing and all the other smart phone designed apps work. The open source design makes for all sorts of obscure market apps. Plenty of developers out there. You can find some weird stuff for Android that you won't find on other platforms. Lots of pretty good free apps and plenty of cheap stuff too that is impressive.\n\nSo next I had to decide on size. For 99% of my uses, the 10 inch seemed to be the better choice and with a number of these with docking key pads available, I went that way rather than the smaller versions. So then I had to decide which one. It didn't take long to realize that ASUS was probably the leader in the field and known for very high quality products. Likewise it only took a bit longer to see that the Infinity TF700 with 64GB, was the machine to have. I also opted for the docking keypad.\n\nThe tablet is very impressive. The screen resolution is right up there with the best ipad. The NVIDIA quad core CPU is a screamer. Can't get much better. Cameras are very good. Battery life is good and amazing with the dock which also has a battery in it. With all the features together, I think this is the best Android tablet out there today and most pro revues agree.\n\nAs a new user to this scene, I'm sure others may have different ideas that got me to this choice, but I can say that I am completely satisfied. That said, as a \"newbie\" I suppose you might think anything would seem that way, however, I did a lot of research and hands on comparisons and I'm comfortable I bought the best.\n\nI am 99.9% thrilled with it. If it has a flaw, it's probably the speaker which faces the wrong way in my opinion and doesn't have quite the volume and sound quality I'd like. It is fine in a quiet environment, but if there's any background noise it leaves a bit to be desired. I have found that if you hold it with your hand somewhat loosely cupped behind the speaker, the sound level improves dramatically as your hand reflects if towrd you. It is fine with ear buds and I also recently picked up a great little bluetooth speaker, (Clalrity HD by Monster), that kicks butt.\n\nEverything else about the Infinity TF700 seems perfect. The only other way to make it better would be built in 4G and phone capability. If I'm mobile I use mine with a Verizon Jet Pack, which is an awesome device itself. Even on 3G it works better than my built in mobile broadband in my laptop.\n\nDo your own research and get some hands on time if you can to compare because all tablets are not equal. There is no doubt that as far as tablets go, a lot has to do with how you will use it and what for. But if you want the best Android tablet in the 10 inch size range, you can't beat the Infinity TF700. This thing is awesome!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I did a lot of extensive research before deciding on this tablet.  I am an Android novice, as I live in a country without 4G and smartphone technology (yet), so I learned about the operating system from the ground floor.  And I must say, I like it!  The OS is very user friendly and touch response sensitive, the HD screen resolution amazing, and there are thousands of apps - even a huge amount for free.  It's not for heavy users of business and office applications, but more for the average user.  It runs movies and photos and visuals expertly, responds quickly, and is user friendly.  The cameras are good, the front one being good for video chatting, and the rear very nice for photos.  I think this operating system is stable enough to give Apple and MS a run for the money.  And it's so light and sturdy, I don't feel concerned about putting it in my purse (in it's case, of course!) for a quick trip.  Worth the money and the time to learn it - definitely!"}

But the quality of the lone speaker isn't bad at all if you put your head at the back of the device..\n- There is a SLIGHT issue with build quality but it really is barely noticeable how the face is not 100% stiff to the body, but like I said, not really and issue.\n- The headphone jack should be at the top of the device, not where your left hand holds the tablet horizontally.\n- You have to upgrade the firmware when you get it, but now that I have had the tablet for a few months, it's running smooth as ever with an external 32gb Micro SD.\n- All Android devices seem to be bad with large PDFs. I bought this mainly for University usage, so I loaded around 8 PDF textbooks onto it and used it in class. It takes a little long to load (+-300mb PDFs) and the scrolling is jittery. I've tried all the readers out there and Adobe seems to do the job the best.\n\nThat's it...\nThe 1080p video is breathtaking... I have not seen better 1080p video before.\n\nPlease buy yourself a proper cover that protects it's corners well.\nHope this helped."}

I got the keyboard attachment for mine, she uses hers with just the tablet. We are both very pleased. The keyboard attachment makes this thing a powerhouse in the battery life department. I can leave it on the highest screen brightness when I need to and also set the processor to it's fastest level and still get days of use out of it (for an hour or two a day of playing on the internet, games or videos at work).\n\nThe other major advantage to getting the keyboard is that it significantly protects the tablet. They keyboard is the same aluminum as the back of the tablet, so you end up with a super strong protector for the screen when you close the tablet up with the keyboard attached.\n\nPros\n-Beautiful screen resolution, usable in direct sunlight with the settings set to their brightest\n-Great battery life\n-Amazing battery life combined with the keyboards internal battery\n-Android OS is great and has already updated to Jelly Bean\n-Good lucking aluminum casing\n\nCons\n-Stupid proprietary charging/USB adapter\n-Slight flex in the screen.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I wish I had read reviews before I bought my ASUS T700T but I suffered from an impulse buy.  Not 6 weeks of ownership and the screen is cracked on the left upper corner.  To be fair, the unit fell about 9 inches and landed flat on a hard surface.  The unit slipped out of a portfolio and fell between the seat and the car door and when I opened the door it fell out.  Gorilla Glass is used but I see nothing tough about it, it is either too fragile for such a device or just poorly engineered in the frame.  I am not going to waste my time calling ASUS as other reviews regarding broken glass indicated poor customer service. To be fair; I have no 1st-hand experience with ASUS customer service.  The loss is accepted and I am off to buy another tablet. But I cannot consider ASUS again as their products are too fragile for use as a portable handheld device.  Based on other reviews here and on other bulletin boards, there seems to be a mechanical issue with the glass particularly in the upper left hand corner.  Broken glass is rarely going to be considered the manufacturer's fault, and really the accident is my fault, and not ASUS'. The product is simply not rugged enough for the intended application.  Such a device, given the intended purpose, should be able to withstand such a small amount of force.\n\nThe shame is that the T700T tablet is fun to use.  It connects to Wi-Fi almost instantly, is fast when connected or not, has a rather stunning display and rarely crashes.  None of that is worth much when the hardware is so fragile.  Survivability in a portable handheld device is a need to have.  My Dell Latitude Computer has been dropped, it has a scratch, has worked fine ever since.  My Samsung Charge has been dropped (more than once, from higher heights and onto harder surfaces), it has a scratch, but still works as it did when new.  My ASUS Tabled was dropped once from a height of 9 inches, the screen is cracked, it still works, but the cracked area is rough and might even cut a finger rendering it useless.\n\nIf you are looking for a tablet that you will not move, nor ever put in risk of dropping, the ASUS T700T may be a good choice.  If however you ever intend to move the tablet, risking accidentally dropping it, the ASUS T700T is not a good choice; you will eventually have to replace it when you or anyone handling the unit accidentally drops it.  The T700T is just not built rugged enough given the intended application of the technology."}

Paper specs are among the best out there today for an Android tablet.\n\nGood points for me:\n- Battery life (internal+keyboard)is very good.  I'm getting about 8-9 hours total\n- Love ICS\n- Great screen in terms of clarity, sharpness, picture quality\n\nBiggest dissapointments are:\n- The sluggish performances.  This was surprising.  Very perceivable delay when switching apps, opening settings w/in apps, even scrolling between screens\n- Asus keyboard hinge only goes to about 120 degrees.  So you can't fold it flat.  I'd like to leave the keyboard/battery attached to maximize unplugged power and still have a \"tablet\".  Not possible.  With keyboard/battery attached, you're forced to use it like a laptop.  There are some apps where I want to be in portrait mode.  Had to install an add-on screen control to force portrait w/ the keyboard/battery attached (still awkward to hold it like an open book)\n- Asus keyboard overly sensitive.  I have a problem with the \"mouse\" focus staying fixed when typing on the keyboard.  Many times I start typing and find out the cursor lost focus and what I typed was lost\n- Delay for the keyboard to become active generally.  Whether it's entering the screen lock PIN or starting to type, seems like there's a power down mode that requires me to learn to wait a half second anytime I need to start typing.  Otherwise, the first couple of key presses doesn't register.\n\nI'm still within my return period (Best Buy).  Seriously thinking of doing that because of these usability annoyances."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I have had this for 3 months now, it has been working great. No problems at all. I have only had to restart it a few times. Graphics are great and it just looks great in general. For the performance you just can't beat the price. FYI, I think firefox might be the best browser to use so far. Chrome doesn't seem to work that great, and chrome does not support flash on tablets.\n\nUpdate:\nIts been about six months now and still running great. I dropped the tablet off of my bathroom counter and even though the screen got separated a little, i just popped back in place. It never cracked.\nSomething people seem to complain about is the non micro usb charger, but this really hasn't been a big deal. I have a feeling the charger asus uses is faster than the micro usb because the tablet charges very fast.\nAnother complaint is with web browsing. The speed of the browsers seem to be way to inconsistent. It will be fast one second, slow the next. This includes chrome. However, all the apps seem to be very fast.\nNo flash support is also annoying, but firefox supports it so you can just download that.\n\nFinally, i have all kinds of movies that are in different formats, but the stock media player does not play all of them. After searching long and hard on the google store i finally found bsplayer. Bsplayer has played everything ive thrown at it including 720p and 1080p movies, which is what i really wanted. I tried mxplayer, mobo player and vplayer and they couldn't do the job. The picture of a 720p or 1080p movie just made this tablet worth the money. Playing whatever movie i want would be a lot harder on an ipad.\n\nOverall i think the only real annoyance ended up being the inconsistency of the web browser speed. Blazing fast one moment, slow the next. Its still not that bad, but should be better. Hopefully not all models have this problem."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "my first tablet was an ipad2. a great device but far from perfect. my second tablet was an asus transformer prime. a great tablet also. it was new and innovative, but bugs like poor wifi and gps reception. Oh but this one, the infinity is from the perspective of tech geek nothing short of magnificent.  it runs on the android jellybean operating system which is stable, fast and very intuitive to use. battery life is phenomenal and unlike others this has so much power in part due to the underlying tegra 3 chip set which enables to choose you power options low, balanced or full performance depending on what you are doing and can easily stretch out that battery life from the tablet alone to around 12-13 hours.  it has second gen. gorilla glass that even the newest ipad is lacking. the screen resolution is just a hair shy of the retina display of the newest apple tablets. that said it is a after all a ten inch screen so side by side viewing you cannot tell a difference.  it does have something no other tablet maker has and that is a super ips screen. that means if you need to use it outside in the sun you simply touch the ips icon and you can make the display brighten so much it is easily used even in bright sunlight. if you hold the tablet in your hands it feels rock solid, excellent build quality. software, os and app updates are sent out periodically any you need do little or nothing as the process is so smooth and automated for the most part. built into the tablet is a micro sd slot which i can tell you from experience it can handle a 64gb card just fine. note, if by chance you get a card check the formatting first as most come fat32 or exfat. you don't want either though the fat32 will work, but really you should change using another device, pc format to ntfs for best results.  i also have the docking station/keyboard and even though it cost around $140 bucks more i consider that essential. reasons being for one a second battery built into that which provides another four hours of up time. you also get a usb 2.0 connection, a regular sd card slot(good for up to 128gb), a micro hdmi connection, besides std microphone, headphone connections. the tablet slides into the dock so simply i don't see how they could improve that aspect. it locks firmly and no fear of coming loose. it also detaches just as easily, slide the button and lift. typing is a bit cramped but it is a ten inch tablet/ultrabook depending on your needs at the time. wifi and gps issues with the out of production tf201 are long gone and work very will with the infinity. there are also as of this writing more than 700,000 apps to choose from in the android store e.g. google play store. though you don't need it as cross platform office apps and good ones are already available and play well with msoffice, keep in mind office for android is set to be released this coming march 2013. so if you want the best, one that will stand the test of time and will set you apart from every other tablet owner, the infinity is the one to go for. you absolutely will not be disappointed. normally i am not nearly so long winded with my reviews but it is rare that i get something and am so very satisfied with it and fyi, the ipad 2, i gave it to my daughter."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I bought this tablet to replace my Kindle Fire (it worked and wasn't old, but I wanted a full-sized tablet). I have had the ASUS for 2-3 months, and it works great. I can do everything I did on the Kindle Fire, read books, play games, watch movies, browse the web, etc, and all on a bigger screen, which is nice. It also has a camera, though the back camera takes the same clarity pictures as my phone, which is smaller and easier to take pictures with. My sister has an iPad, and from what I saw it appears that the ASUS can do everything the iPad can. However, the ASUS has a bigger 10.1\" screen instead of a 9.7\" screen, and the memory can be expanded via a microSD card.\nThere are only a few cons I have with the tablet. The first con I have is that it goes slowly or freezes up once in a while, but it does not do it so often to create a problem. And it usually does that when I'm browsing the web, so it might be a problem with my web browser, Firefox, and not the tablet. Another con isn't really a con with the tablet, but that Amazon has not created an Amazon Video Store app for Android. You're forced to stream Amazon Instant Videos through the web, and I felt the built-in Amazon Video Store app the Kindle Fire had made streaming videos much nicer than using a web browser. Also, I would have preferred the champagne color, but when I bought it in September the champagne color was not sold by most sellers.\nI do not feel the cons are that big of a problem, and would recommend this tablet to anyone wanting to read, or watch movies or browse the web on the go. It is one of the best Android tablets out there at the time this review was written, and will no doubt last for years into the future. Currently, the only tablet I know of that has better RAM and speed is the Google Nexus 10, and it is not a significant improvement.\nFinally, a piece of advice I have would be to strongly consider what you want for a case before purchasing a case. The first case I got was a rooCase Dual-View. I found the rooCase Dual-View to be bulky when using it, and preferred using it outside of the case, and decided that I would prefer a sleeve since if I'm going to take it out of the case to use it anyway, I'd prefer something that would completely surround it and not leave parts of it exposed to possible dirt when I'm not using it. The sleeve I ordered does not seem to be very thick, though, and I am worried that it might not protect the tablet well enough, so I am currently looking at getting a third case/sleeve/bag for it. So, the lesson I have is that you should strongly consider whether or not you mind having a bulky case around the tablet when using it, and if you do not want it exposed to dirt/etc when not in use, and other factors so you do not spend a fortune on getting different cases for the tablet. (Will (probably) update the review once I find a case/sleeve/bag that works well).\n\nUpdate January 30, 2013 (on Cases):\nAs far as cases for the TF700, I recommend the IVSO slim-fit case, or a similar case. The IVSO is very minimal, with just hooks on the corners, and the back and front covered. However, it seems sturdy and is protected in all the necessary places (namely, the corneres). It is much thinner than the rooCase was, and the front cover is much easier to fold behind the tablet than the rooCase. I also store the tablet in the IVSO case inside a Targus Impax sleeve, which is also a high quality sleeve that I'd recommend to give extra protection to the tablet when not in use. It is a little bigger than necessary for the tablet, but it is made for 10\" laptops, and there are very few sleeves made specifically for the TF700."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "Below is a review of several tablets I tried in MY chronological sequence with them, with explanations of why I rejected all but the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet. I am placing the same review under each model I tried.\n\nBackground - I am now 65 - NOT a member of the electronic generation! I love playing Scrabble and thought intensive games in general. I know very little about smart phones or tablets.  I firmly believe that a company OWES SUPPORT to their consumers and NOT at additional cost! Customer service is VERY important to me! Before anyone accuses me of bias: I have NO connection to ANY of the companies mentioned. I am simply a consumer relating my personal experiences!\n\niPad - first generation - EVERYTHING you do with it is tied to iTunes.  When I tried it, there was absolutely NO manual or documentation available for iTunes.  Beyond the first 90 days Apple wants to charge for tech support.  I found iTunes and the Apple OS to be confusing and difficult to use.  The tablet, itself, performed well but I prefer an OS that allows direct folder and file access.\n\nSamsung Galaxy 7 inch tablet first generation. This device runs Android 2.3. It is now several years old and STILL functions perfectly. The battery still holds an all day charge with moderate usage. I have never found an app that is \"incompatible\" with this model. This is an important point in the reviews that follow. I even used it to shoot surprisingly excellent videos of a music/dance presentation in a dimly lit auditorium.  Now, several years later, with cataracts growing in both eyes as well as \"floaters\" in both eyes, I was seeking a screen larger than the 7 inch.\n\nMotorola Xoom 10.1 tablet. It is HEAVY. While it worked well, for reasons unknown to me it was not compatible with several of my favorite apps. Furthermore, the screen seems to get greasy very quickly!\n\nAsus TF300 Transformer 10.1 inch tablet.  While the construction of mine was solid, all the other negative observations of other reviewers were immediately apparent. The tablet would not maintain wi-fi contact even close to my router. The Asus TF300 was also incompatible with many of my favorite apps. Finally, the Asus TF300 (and TF700 mentioned below) has a strange auto-spelling correct system that FREQUENTLY screwed up my typing. To their credit, Asus did answer my question with instructions on how to turn the spelling correction off, but only via email. They have NO telephone tech support.\n\nSamsung Galaxy NOTE 10.1 inch tablet. While it offers a pull out writing stylus AND a rear facing autofocus camera, I saw little difference between it and the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 table discussed below.  At roughly $200 more than the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet, although it performed well, I did not feel it was worth the difference in price.\n\nAsus TF700 Transformer Infinity -  suffers many of the same problems as the less expensive TF300 model. SPASTIC OS, intermittent wi-fi disconnection. The auto-brightness control also appeared not to work or not to work properly. Perhaps worst of all, possibly because of the increased resolution (the improved resolution was NOT apparent to MY eyes - it appeared to me about the same as all the other tablets) the device is incompatible with MANY apps!\n\nSamsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet.  It performed as well as my first generation Samsung Galaxy 7 inch tablet until I tried to download the QuickMark app to scan bar and QR codes. According to the app developer, the app is incompatible with the tablet because the tablet does NOT have an \"autofocus\" rear facing camera.  A phone call to Samsung tech support, and YES - Samsung BELIEVES in customer support at no extra charge, confirmed the absence of autofocus in the rear facing camera!  Since  I do NOT carry the tablet with me when I go shopping and am NOT likely to scan Bar or QR codes often, I felt I could live without the autofocus rear camera.  However, I did find a different QR code app that DOES work on the tablet.  I have now had the tablet for a week and am loving it. SO FAR, I have not found any incompatible apps other than QuickMark. I find the screen to be bright and sharp (auto brightness works well), and the contrast to be superb. I have used it to watch Big Bang Theory via the TBS app. The Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 inch tablet maintains strong wi-fi connection both anywhere in my home and at the school where I attend classes. Other than the lack of autofocus in the rear camera and the lack of direct USB connectivity without their proprietary cable (sadly, this lack of standardization is still common amongst tablet manufacturers), I have absolutely no complaints at this time.\n\nIF you do not need or can live without a rear camera that autofocuses (it DOES have a rear camera and a front camera for SKYPE and other functions), I highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet. At the current price of $300 for the wi-fi 16GB model (memory is expandable through a micro SD card. I see no need for a 32GB model), it is VERY reasonable! I think there are also cell phone service compatible models at additional cost.\n\nAdvice to tablet shoppers:\n\n1 - Buy from a source that allows easy returns without restocking fees. Amazon is EXCELLENT for their customer service, but you may want to buy from a local store to avoid shipping time and costs. Buy from a source that does NOT charge a restocking fee AND allows a reasonable time for device trial.\n\n2 - Download as many apps that are free and that look appealing to you. Try each one at least briefly.  NOTE any apps that are not compatible with the tablet you are testing. How important are they to you?\n\n3 - Look at each screen under bright and dim lighting. How do YOU find the brightness (usually adjustable, if auto-brightness does not work well for you), the contrast, the sharpness?\n\n4 - Log into your email account and/or create a Gmail account. Type an email to someone. Does the auto spelling correct work well for you? Is the virtual keyboard suited to your style and needs?\n\n5 - Play with the tablet for a whole day, if you can afford the luxury of sitting with it on. See how long the battery lasts."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I bought this tablet from Best Buy since I was a little hesitant about buying such a big $ purchase online. I returned my first one because the screen would occasionally go gray and force itself to reboot after ten seconds, and I added a service plan to it. It was running the original ice cream firmware that came with the tablet. I tried updating the firmware manually from ASUS's website, but none were available at the time. After swapping it for another, the replacement did the same thing!\n\nRead a little deeper on forums and learned it was a known issue for this tablet while running ice cream. There was a firmware update finally posted on the site, but the tablet did not download it automatically. Had to manually download it and go through the hassle of how to setup the zip file in the correct directory to install. Now the tablet automatically downloads firmware updates, and after doing a factory reset, the gray screen issue went away.\n\nOnce you get the latest firmware of jellybean installed, it is a great tablet. The battery lasts about 5-7 days depending on how much I use it for games and music. I'm not too fond of the speaker being on the backside of it, but the leather case I bought on Amazon for it helps bounce the sound. The screen has horrible reflections from light sources, but I bought a matte finish protector for it from Amazon to fix that. After using the default browser, Firefox, and Chrome, I conclude Chrome works the fastest with this tablet. I convinced my mom to buy one of these, and she's been loving it ever since. Her tablet automatically downloaded the firmware without a manual push, so I'm assuming ASUS fixed this update process. I'm happy with this purchase."}

I have a Galaxy S3.\n\nI am very impressed with this tablet. No form, fit or finish issues. Very solid/dense feeling. I had two firmware updates (started at 4.0.3); the JB update went off without a hitch. I would make sure you have a good WiFi connection and even plug it in (overkill) to ensure you don't have any issues during the updates. The few negative comments about JB updates and the aftermath are not being seen by me.\n\nThe damn thing is addictive! I've got HBO GO and WatchESPN so I am untethered for any TV programs I like. I've added the SwiftKey for Tablet as I found it worked much better than the standard keyboard on my S3. The voice to text works great too. I connected to my home WiFi (secure) with no issues. Only problem is that it did not store the long security key for my upstairs dLink WiFi.  However, it seems to love my downstairs Amped WiFi repeater and I get good signals all over the home, so I haven't looked into whether it can store security keys or not.\n\nI ordered a Bobj heavy duty case for it. That is not one of the more elegant cases but it looks very functional and has the ability to work as a stand. BTW it has rolled edging with will be nice since the edges on TF700t tend to bite after awhile. No big deal. I may also install a Zagg Invisashield as I have done on all my phones. The glass does pick up finger prints but the cloth they provide does a nice job of dry cleaning.\n\nLook, I've never been an Apple Accolyte so having something this well made, very fast and excellent screen from the Android world warms my heart. You can't get a better tablet than the TF700t."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "UPDATE:  I have now used this tablet for 5 months.  2 months in, the bottom left area on the touch screen began making a clicking sound when pressed and it feels as if that area on the screen has come loose from the rest of the tablet.  I have contacted ASUS support and though their responses have been fast, they have not been helpful at all in answering my questions.  I still like this tablet and it works well for everything I use it for, but I am concerned about the issue I am having and the poor communication from ASUS.\n\nMy wife purchased this tablet for me through Amazon as an early X-Mas present in 11/2012.  I had been looking at new tablets and had at first decided on the new iPad and while there is a lot I like about the iPad, I do not like that you cannot add a micro SD card to increase capacity.  For this reason I decided to go with an Android tablet.  Prior to the TF700T I was using a Leader Impression 10 inch Android tablet.  My tablet use was primarily reading ebooks, surfing the web, and playing a few games.  This tablet was a VERY big step up in quality!\n\nFrom the start I liked the way it felt.  It has a very sturdy and solid feel, but is not too heavy.  There are only 3 exterior buttons, power and volume up/down, and the way these buttons are placed I do not find myself accidentally pressing them like I did on my previous tablet which was frustrating when reading a book and switching hands holding the tablet.  All other controls are accessed with the touch screen.\n\nI have not had any issues with the WiFi or the GPS though I seldom use the GPS.  I have not used the Bluetooth connection yet.  I did start using a stylus and find that it really reduces the smudges my fingers leave on the screen.  Battery life is decent.  After fully charging the battery prior to the first use and then fully discharging before charging again I have to plug it in every other night.\n\nThis tablet arrived with Ice Cream Sandwich, but after a week I was notified that a firmware update had been downloaded that would upgrade the tablet to the latest version of Android, Jelly Bean.  Not knowing much about Jelly Bean, I was very glad that the firmware update informed me that Jelly Bean did not support Adobe Flash.  I was not sure if I could live without Flash, but after a week I decided to update and have not noticed any difference in not having flash support.  I appreciated that the upgrade advised me of this prior to the install.\n\nAfter using the tablet for a few weeks now, I am very happy with it.  I find myself watching movies and neflix, reading books, playing more games than I should, and surfing the net.  I am thinking about buying the keyboard dock which will increase the battery life, add an SD card slot, and a USB port.  We'll see.\n\nThis is a good quality tablet.  Is it an iPad?  No, but I do not regret my decision in asking for this tablet."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "When I unboxed the Infinity on Monday, I was impressed by its build quality and design. At first glance, the screen looked a little smaller than I expected, but that was mainly because it has a decent border around it. When I booted up the device, everything ran smoothly. Apps where launching instantly, swapping between different screens was smooth, and overall everything was working fine.\n\nOn Tuesday, I got a notification to update the OS to the newest version. I was going to get Jelly Bean! So I went ahead and started the update process. After everything finished and the device rebooted, I immediately noticed hiccups. However, I had installed a bunch of apps, so it did not concern me that much.\n\nOn Wednesday I ran a small game I am developing and I saw the screen flicker. \"OK\", I said, \"This is probably my fault. There must be something in the code\". So I didn't give it much attention either.\n\nOn Thursday, while holding the device I noticed that there was space between the glass and the back casing, on the bottom side. I had just ordered a case for it, so again, I was not that much concerned about it.\n\nOn Friday the device froze completely while I was browsing the web. I held the power button down until it rebooted. When the OS came up again, a message informed me that it installed an update. Weird; I did not remember reading anything about an update.\n\nNow I'm concerned. I noticed the flickering in another game, the space between the glass was becoming annoying and the hiccups were becoming more and more obvious. But I was willing to put up with all of this until the device froze completely again. Unfortunately, this time when I rebooted I got an \"Encryption Unsuccessful\" error screen while the OS was booting. It clearly stated that I had to factory reset the device and loose everything. I was speechless.\n\nThis is just the 5th day of using the device. It did not fell, I did not root it, I did not do anything out of the ordinary, and yet, it was completely useless in less than a full week of use. Wow. The device felt like it had so much potential. I search the Internet to find out what happened and it turned out that this is quite a common problem after the OS update. I did not find any website on how to fix this permanently, but did find a bunch of articles that tried to fix it and had them see similar problems later.\n\nI wasn't going to risk keeping this device and finding out it can't be fixed after my return window goes away. Especially when a very good competing Android tablet just became available. The only reason this is not a 1 star review is because the device looks and feels very good, the specs are amazing, and, if you happen to buy this device with none of the problems mentioned above, it is a very good choice. Personally, I'm not going to risk this much money for a replacement unit that might break again."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "Last month my tf201 screen cracked, the product still worked fine but the crack bothered me so I decided that I needed a new tablet. My choice was between the TF700 and the Note 10.1 tablet. I drove an hour to best buy so I could play around with both of them. Let me start off by saying that the Note 10.1 is no slouch it plays great video, takes good photos, the S pen rocks, great speaker placement, and it has things like multi-tasking that I really wish ASUS had. However it didn't feel like it ran smoothly to me. I have a Galaxy SII from sprint and I love it but this item seemed like it lagged and I had to apply a very firm touch several times for the home/back buttons to work. Wifi at the store was laggy and I couldn't really compare speeds but both tablets seemed close to one another at the store.\n\nOne of the biggest factors in my decision though was the overall look of the product. The Asus 201 and 700 just look so much better than any other tablet on the market and have a really nice feel to them. The Samsung was made of plastic and did not feel as high quality as the ASUS.\n\nOverall the TF700 has a better screen and a few more functions than the TF201. It feels almost like the same tablet. I should note though that is does seem slightly faster. I never had a GPS problem with my TF201 but had poor wifi at various hotels I stayed at and that was frustrating. with the 201 and 700 selling for the same price there is no reason to get the TF201. If you are looking for a tablet that will stand out from the rest and performs just as well as any other 10\" tablet this is a great place to start.\n\nI got this case for it and highly recommend it.\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Asus-Transformer-Pad-Infinity-TF700-TF700T-Portfolio-Carry-Case-BUNDLE-COPPER-Microfiber-Interior-Matte-Anti-Glare-Screen-Protector-BONUS-Stylus-by-SecondShells--Android-4-0-Tablet/dp/B00979R82S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Asus Transformer Pad Infinity TF700 / TF700T Portfolio Carry Case |BUNDLE| |COPPER| |Microfiber Interior| + Matte Anti Glare Screen Protector + BONUS Stylus by SecondShells  Android 4.0 Tablet</a>"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "The world of Android tablets, or just tablets in general, is a very confusing one. I'm not one to make a big purchase like this without doing my homework first. I don't want to spend my money on something that I'm going to end up regretting. So, I did a lot of research and a lot of back and forth between different brands and features, but in the end I really felt like this was the tablet that could suit all of my needs. So far, I've been correct.\n\nI'll make this review fairly simple and to the point-\n\nPROS-\n-Android 4.2- I just love Android first of all. I toyed with the idea of an iPad but the Apple iOS is just so limited and it was very important for me to be have the OS that gave me the most versatility and could be ultra customized to my liking. (It's worth noting that this tablet came with Ice Cream Sandwich out of the box, but a Jelly Bean firmware update was available as soon as I got everything powered up!)\n\n-The Color! I love the Amethyst Grey color... even though I do have it tucked inside of a case (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Poetic-Slimbook-Leather-Case-for-the-ASUS-Transformer-Pad-Infinity-TF700/dp/B008IEGT82/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Poetic Slimbook Leather Case for the ASUS Transformer Pad Infinity TF700</a>), so the color didn't matter much after all, haha. I would say that the color is neutral enough though for either a guy or a girl to carry around without shame :) My husband loves it...but then again, it's in the case! :)\n\n-Very sturdy feel- This tablet just feels well made to me. I love the fact that the screen has the Gorilla Glass and the metal backing- it makes me feel more comfortable taking it out of the case; I don't feel like it's going to get all scratched and dinged up. I have three young boys, all under the age of five and they are extremely interested in playing with this, so it was very important for me to have something that would hold up to any potential torture they might put it through. So far though, I've kept it out of reach, but I do like knowing that if they do get a hold of it at any point, it will be safe!\n\n-Thin!- I love the sleek design of the tablet- it's comfortable to hold in or out of a case, and is a reasonable enough size to be able to slip it right into my purse or diaper bag along with everything else and it fits right in without any added bulk.\n\n-The Camera!!- This is an extremely important feature. I didn't actually think that I would take too many pictures with the tablet because I always have my phone with me and I always felt like taking pictures with something of this size was just clumsy and foreign. That was until I used the camera on it!! Oh man does it take some nice pictures! I dare say it takes clearer, crisper pictures than my Galaxy S II and it takes them faster too! My kids are quick so it's hard to get a picture of them that isn't just a blurry streak, but the shutter time on this camera is almost non existent and it makes it MUCH easier to snap a pic and have it come out nice.\n\nSince I want this to be a very honest review, I do have to say that I have noticed a couple little things about it that are worth noting. They aren't worthy of a list like the pros, but here they are anyway... There have been a couple of times when randomly the screen has gone white and everything froze up, then restarted. But it has only happened MAYBE three times in the three weeks that I've owned it. The other thing is that there is a line across the screen that blinks every now and again- it's very brief and doesn't affect anything else. That is all that I've noticed that could be considered negatives.\n\nSo ultimately I have to say that the pros of this tablet certainly outweigh the cons! If you're looking for a tablet, look no further- get this tablet!! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I ordered this product on a Monday and received it the next day. I've had the tablet for almost 2 weeks now and feel compelled to write this review in light of the more nit-picky negative reviews (read unfair) over the past couple of days. This is my first tablet ever and purchased it after watching the tablet wars for some time and made my purchase decision after extensive comparisons to the iPads, Surface and Samsungs. Even considered the Sony version with keypad and the Fire Kindles. Overall, the TF700T beats them all hands down - no question. When one balances price (paid $428 for new), features for the occasional road warrior (mini SD and HDMI ports), long battery life, outstanding resolution for the price (1920 x 1200 wow!), the ability to turn itself into an ultrabook when it is docked with the keyboard when one needs to do serious work and the really nice Android 4.1 OS - it is the best value for money there is given the current market right now.\n\nWhere the ASUS TF700T really shines is the amazing industrial design of how the tablet and external keyboard come together to make a very compact Ultrabook with even more battery power in the keyboard and THEN full size SD and USB ports that complement the mini ports on the tablet. Done with the serious work? Just detach the tablet and leave the keyboard dock behind. ASUS really had their thinking caps on when they designed this and beat the hell out of the competition. You can be sure Apple and MS are kicking themselves for not having thought of this design configuration first. Apple is dependent on Logitech for their external keyboard. The Surface has to have it's kickstand open to access the SD port and if you're typing on your lap, well, have fun ....\n\niPad is fun but a toy because it lacks the practicalities like mini-SD and/or mini-HDMI and an external keyboard when extensive typing is needed or a built-in mouse when more accurate pointing is needed. If you want GPS, tough, you have to pay for the WiFi-Cellular option whether you want the cellular option or not. WiFi alone means no GPS. The TF700T currently only comes with WiFi and Bluetooth and GPS - awesome deal. It's all I need because high-speed cellular data connections are too expensive and can be choppy depending on where you are.\n\nThe Surface is clean and .... boring. Really Microsoft boring. Windows is great for my desktop where it belongs. I refused to pay for the lower screen resolution of 13xx by whatever .. it just seemed ridiculous when most of the other tablets were offering much higher HD level resolutions. The Surface tablets also need 2GB of RAM to accommodate the OS, so one would be paying for additional memory to run what seems like an inefficient (read bloated) OS. The TF700T only needs 1GB of RAM with plenty leftover - kudos to Android designers.\n\nGalaxy - not bad but felt big and heavy, almost clunky. Some nice features, but not enough to make me buy it when I had the TF700T available.\n\nI've seen reviews recently that are unhappy about flash players not being supported. The tablet comes installed with a video player and I've played videos on Chrome from Netflix, etc, etc. No problems with speed or quality whatsoever. What is the big deal about flash? Is there a shortage of apps for playing videos on Android platforms? Why the loyalty to flash players? And so because of this ONE feature for which there many perfectly good alternatives, reviewers ding the product heavily. Come on .....\n\nI've not had any need for direct ASUS support so I can't comment that. But not having to call the manufacturer is probably a good thing, I think. The tablet even knows when to update itself. For example, I received it out of the box running Android 4.0. Within a couple of days, it automatically updated itself to 4.1.x and rebooted itself. Smart. And all the apps continue to update themselves.\n\nThe negatives - only 2.4GHz WiFi, no 5.0GHz, no MIMO (multiple antennas) and the automatic switch between landscape and portrait formats can be a little oversensitive and sometimes slow to switch but it's not a big irritant for me. If you are impatient and expect INSTANT switching then you will be unhappy, I suppose ....\n\nIf you are still reading this review then I suggest you read the negative reviews carefully and you'll realize most them are about one or two issues that really aren't that big a deal after all (unless it's basic product functionality like something not working at all which is product quality) and may not even be a concern for your purchase decision.\n\nP.S. Get the ArmorSuit MilitaryShield as a screen protector, works great.\nP.P.S. Forgot to mention the TF700T comes with Corningware Gorilla Glass so the display looks really nice and the ArmorSuit doesn't spoil it at all. Competing tablets don't all come with Gorilla Glass, think about that one."}

I have tried 2 asus transformer infinity tablets so far and both of them experience the issue.  The issue is that anytime you do something thats very packet heavy for example using Splashtop remote desktop at high resolution it will drop the wifi connection.  Some people say its an incompatibility with several routers.  I am using an ASUS RT-N16 with Tomato firmware.  I have several other android devices and laptops and these 2 asus transformer infinity tablets are the only devices that lose connection.\n\nFor the typical user you may never experience this but for those that are doing something like constantly using splashtop remote desktop and connecting via wireless-n then you may experience disconnects.  Changing the router to Wireless-G only resolves the issue but of course my speed is brought down.\n\nI think everything else about the tablet has been pretty much covered in other reviews.  Oh I want to remind everyone that if they plan to Root or Unlock then do so before doing any firmware updates.  Use Rootkeeper to keep root between firmware updates."}

Even buying an extra charger cable is a big hassle and expensive for Excite 10.\n\nI thought TF700 would be crushed by Windows 8 Surface, but now the price even went up after the Surface entered the market.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I give this tablet 2 stars simply because while a good tablet, it just didn't mesh with me while using it.\n\nAs an avid Android user I am very used to the android environment in general, so it was pleasant to be able to use android 4.1 on this tablet. I liked how with a quick tap you can pull up all your active apps and switch to any of them that you want or after pulling up the active apps, with a quick swipe, close them to free up memory. I liked how the clock and notifications were displayed down in the lower right and you could get to the settings quickly by pulling up the notification pane and tapping the settings icon. I liked the screen resolution and brightness. I liked the finish on the back of the tablet, it sort of looks like brushed aluminum, and mine was a little darker than I expected from the pictures, but I actually liked that better. The back also resists fingerprints pretty easily, however felt a bit slippery at times, especially if you have sweaty hands.\n\nNow for the dislikes. I did not like the feel of the tablet in my hands. The way it is put together, there is a sharp edge all the way around the tablet that feels like it digs into your hands. I read a few reviews that complained about the screen being loose around the edges and found the model that I received to have the same issue, especially near the corners. If you press down lightly, you can feel the glass move downward and then when you let go it pops back into place with an audible click. The weight of the tablet is also odd. It did not weigh so much that I could not hold it with one hand, but it felt like the balance was off because holding it in one hand was very awkward, even for me and my hands are not even close to small. All in all with the sharp edges and the odd balance it just wasn't comfortable to hold for extended periods and since I intended to use it for movie watching and reading quite a bit, this is an issue.\n\nBefore purchasing the Transformer Infinity, I was considering the 8.9\" Fire HD since I previously owned the original Fire and really liked it. I decided to go with the Infinity though because I was looking for something with a little more of the vanilla Android flavor. Now I'm thinking that once I get the money back from returning the Infinity I will get the 8.9\" Fire HD since it has the same screen resolution and looks to have a more comfortable form factor. It will also have the ability to watch Amazon Instant Videos, which disappointingly, the Infinity cannot since you are unable to install Adobe Flash on the Infinity. If I want a tablet with the vanilla Android experience after I get the 8.9\" Fire, I think i will go with the Nexus 7 since that is still considered to be pretty much the best 7\" Android tablet on the market.\n\nAll in all I would have been much more satisfied with the Transformer Infinity if it had just been comfortable to hold. Plus the inability to install Flash was very disappointing considering how prevalent Flash still is on the internet. I'm hoping that I will be much more satisfied with the 8.9\" Fire HD and I expect to be since it has pretty much all the features that I wished I'd had on my original Fire."}

It has the functionality of a laptop, but the processor(for games) of a tablet. It's display is beautiful, and the speaker is very clear. It is very fast and functional. I love it. If you are getting a tablet, this is the one to get.\n\nUpdate***** 1-15-13\n\nNow That I have had this for awhile, (6 months) It has shown some signs a wear, which i am not pleased with. It constantly has issues booting up properly (I shut it off when I don't use it) And it also takes a minute or two for the home screen to load once I quit out of a game. I have taken great care of it so there is no excuse other than poor construction. One other issue not with the tablet but the operating system. I purchased an app on the Google Play store for USD$1.99, and when I tried to install it, an error popped up saying you must first purchase this item to download it. I checked my bills, and they charged me for something I was unable to download. Not Cool Google/ Android. I still like the keyboard when it works, but it sometimes disconnects. The top row of the keyboard is also very annoying because of pressing them and turning off wifi when i don't want to. I plan on selling it and buying an iPad. Buy at your own risk.\n\nUpdate***** 2-28-13\n\nI now cannot have the tablet on for more than 3 hours before it crashes and I have to hold the power button until it turns off and resets. It also has a flaw with the keyboard. If you have it not attached to the tablet, it looses its charge if it is completely full in an hour. I am also still having troubles with the Play Store and am refusing to buy another android tablet. The new Jellybean (4.1) update for it is next to pointless, and just hogs space on the hard drive.\n\nUpdate***** 4-12-13\n\nI finally got rid of the slow pig of a tablet. The 1GB RAM is incredibly slow after all of the unnecessary system tasks are running. Sold it and got a Nexus 10.\n\nPros:\nWorks great for typing\nGreat for business\n\"looks\" good\n\nCons:\nOperating System\nSlow after any applications are loaded on it\nSlow for any graphic intensive games\nStarting to break down after 6 months\n\n3 of 5 overall."}

But for reading manga in horizontal mode, I think the ipad would be better because the ipad is wider. The 10.1 screen is not long enough to cover the entire page of manga.

The Nexus 7 was far and away my favorite tablet.  Only drawback: It's 7\".  Don't get me wrong, it's FANTASTIC on the road and trips in the car, bus or plane.  I just needed a larger screen.  Enter the T700.  I bought mine at Best Buy because deliveries in my area are difficult.  I tore open the box and started charging it.  Ok...one hour down and I decided to turn it on.  I pushed the rather small and set to far in power button.  Hmmm...no power just a blinking amber light and a little vibration.  Ok, maybe more charging time.  3 hours pass and I try again.  This time success.  Seems kinda odd that Asus decided not to pre-charge unit, but, ok I get it.  I enter my Google account info and the basic set up tweaks.  I remember the CNET reviews saying this tablet is \"EDITOR CHOICE\" and \"TOP PRODUCT\" noting speed and screen quality.  Really????  Seems rather slow and oh look it, the battery indicator shows 4%!!! So 4% for 4 hour charge for $500?  I kept the unit plugged and charging for another 7 hours and finally I'm at 100%!  I decided to play a few clips on YouTube and noticed that 1) the wifi signal was only \"good\" even though I was 7 feet from router and 2) the picture quality while smooth was kinda blah.  For having a high res screen I really expected more.  Colors were off and noticed on 1080p videos that there would be less detail.  I tried games and all I would get is force close and crashes.  If you think I didn't update you are wrong.  Did all that.  Item is heading back to BB and will decide on if I should get Nexus 10 or Galaxy Note 10.1.  Save your pennies and avoid this \"EDITOR CHOICE\" item at all costs.\n\nAlso, look up ASUS under BBB.  Not good.  Seems if you're lucky, you get a good unit.  Unlucky, you end up with garbage."}

I have been using hand held computers for over 20 years, from the days of PDA's. I have used and programed Nook Color, Toshiba Excite, PanDigital, Archos Media Tablet, Kindle, Kindle Fire and IPad 2. The IPad 2 is the only one that comes close to the ASUS Infinity, but the display on the ASUS leaves the IPad 2 in the dust. The wide screen on the ASUS is the best for watching video, movies or music videos. I do not play games so I cannot critique. My main interest was movies, the ASUS is excellent at streaming video. I use 32 gb microSD cards to copy DVD (vob) files for play back on the ASUS, the picture and sound is perfect. I use MX Player for video play back, it will play .VOB files as well as most other formats, avi, flv, mov, mp4,3gp, wmv and maybe more. Battery life is good not great for watching movies, I can get through one full length dvd but not two without recharging or using the power adapter. I was prepared to unlock the OS and add a custom ROM, as I usually do with new tablets, but I have not needed to. The ASUS arrived with ICS installed and two days later JB 4.1 was downloaded OTA. Hope this helps I am extremely pleased with this tablet have been using it for a 6 weeks."}

My girl has the latest generation IPAD, and my tablet looks just as impressive, if not more so just on the visuals. The only noticeable adavantage I've seen is the superior speakers on the IPAD. It's not really close. BUT, I use headphones a lot especially in public, and i'm sure most people would as well. And I also often pair it via blue tooth with my Jambox speakers.\n\nIT's running Jelly Bean now, and it is really nice. Asus has some nice apps.\n\nI have to recommend getting the docking station. It is really what takes this tablet to the next level. The increased battery life is incredible. Also, it provides a USB port and the stability for ultimate viewing angle flexibility. The keyboard is a really nice size as well. I just cant say enough about it.\n\nIMPORTANT: You don't not need to spend the extra $50 for a tf700 keyboard. I had read that the tf201 was compatible and basically the same product but with a longer lasting battery that is just repackaged with a different label. I can confirm it to be true. I ordered one from amazon for $95 and it has worked flawlessly. I'm so glad i knew that and didn't pay the extra money for something I didn't need.\n\nIn sum, this tablet is awesome. And there are some really nice browsers that give you great flash support. (Jelly bean doesnt support Adobe Flash) I am so happy with my purchase.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "The Asus Transformer Pad Infinity TF700T is an amazing tablet.  You can tell the device is all quality the second you open the box and hold it in your hands.  This is our first tablet, and we love it.  Here is a list of some of the device's pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n-The screen is amazing.  You can read it in outside during the day while wearing sunglasses.  Needless to say it works just as well indoors.\n-The battery life is great.  It can easy go all day.\n-The Android OS is great.  It's easy to use, fast, and reliable.  The upgrade from Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) to 4.1.1 (Jelly Bean) was a breeze.\n-The device is very stable.  Over a month, it has only frozen 2 times.  In total, I've re-booted it only 3 or 4 times since it arrived.\n-The touch screen is great.  Typing, drawing, navigating, it handles all the tasks flawlessly.\n-The device plays full scale high quality H.264 videos flawlessly.\n-The wifi antenna works great.  I get good reception all over my house (better than my other wifi devices).\n-The Micor-HDMI out is awesome.\n-The 32 GB of external storage is an awesome addition.  Videos play from it perfectly (we have a class 10 card, not sure if a lower class would have an affect or not).\n-The 10' screen is AWESOME.  The size is great for browsing the web, reading books, playing games, or doing just about anything else.\n-The device comes with a small set of useful pre-installed apps.  Asus did NOT fill it up with a bunch of useless promotional garbage apps.\n-The built in camera works really well.\n-The Tegra 3 Quad-core T33@ 1.6GHz processor has easily handled every app I've thrown its way.\n\nCons:\n-The device does not ship with an Micro-HDMI cable.\n-The device uses a proprietary cable to charge and connect via USB (it's not the standard Micro-USB connector).  This is actually annoying because the devices ships with a single cable that is used for both charging (via the AC wall adapter) and connecting to a PC.  So you have to tote the cable from room to room or buy a second one.\n-The edges are not quite as smooth/beveled as they should be.\n-When playing videos, the bottom 20/30 rows of pixels are blacked out (where the home, back, and recent apps icons are located).  This is probably more of an annoying Android \"feature\", but none the less it's ridiculousness this screen real estate goes to waste.\n-The only way to wake the device up is to press the power button.  So far the button works great, but I have a feeling it will be the first thing to wear out.  When it does that will be a big problem.\n-The device is kind of heavy (but bear in mind the TF700T is no heavier than other 10' tables).  You only notice it when doing something like reading an e-book.\n-No FM tuner (but most tablets don't have them anyways).\n-There is no way to store pictures/videos taken with the camera to the SD card.  Again, this is probably more of an OS/App issue, but this really seems like something any device with a camera and removable storage should support straight out of the box.\n\nConclusion:\nUltimately, the positives far outweigh the negatives.  The TFT700T has all the bells and whistles, and brings them together in an amazing package.  If you want a quality tablet that will exceed your expectations, this is the one for you."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "My Transformer's screen shut down less than two weeks after receiving it, which was a pain. However, ASUS was willing to replace it for me even though I bought it used on Amazon. The replacement was not the fastest in the world but I didn't have to push too hard to get them to follow through on the warranty.\nThat inconvenience aside, I love the tablet itself. It runs smooth, looks good, and has a lot of room for customization and fine tuning everything to suit your usage style. Comes with a bit of bloatware but unfortunately that seems to be pretty standard in the smart-device market these days. The one thing that pushed me to get this over any competing products was the optional keyboard dock, and I am so glad I did. The ability to convert between tablet to functioning laptop at the push of a button is really what makes the difference to me. Tablets are fun to play with, but I don't think many people are willing to type out an essay with the on-screen keyboard. When you pair the two together you have all the fun of a tablet without sacrificing productivity. Plus, unlike other options like an iPad plus bluetooth keyboard, it actually increases your battery rather than drain it faster.\nOn another note, my father just purchased the new Microsoft Surface, which is another keyboard-equipped tablet. It seems pretty nice from the fiddling I've done, so if you're a professional or student looking to use your tablet for both work and fun, I would recommend picking between one of those two."}

Which is one of the reasons I decided to get another Tablet (now if they would only make an Android phone for the US market I'd be set). The only complaint that I have is probably that the battery for this one lasts nowhere near as long as the TF101, even on the exact same settings, doing nothing differently.\n\nWith the TF101 I probably charged it every two days or more what with reading for hours at a time, checking email, shopping, heavy research and journal downloads for school. This one, I've had to charge every night, also, I'm not sure if there is something different about this charger, but the TF101 charger is a 12v and the tablet would fully charge in under an hour from about 14%, this one charges significantly slower, after a half an hour it had only gone to 77% charging from somewhere around 45%. For this reason I'm probably going to purchase the dock because even though I didn't get much use out of the TF101 dock, I have a feeling that I'll get much more use out of this one.\n\nAll in all I'm freakishly happy with this purchase, because I also got it for $385 used here on Amazon, but it looked brand new out the book, and even still had all the manufacturer stickers and protective films on it, not a scratch anywhere."}

In terms of aesthetics, the tablet is very beautiful, slim, and elegant.  I love that they used gorilla glass for the touch screen interface, because every couple days you can just wipe it completely clean and have the front looking as new as the day you bought it.\n\nConnectivity on the tablet itself is limited to a headphone jack, the proprietary charging connector, and a micro HDMI port.  The micro-HDMI port, however, does give the tablet a great amount of added features (as even if your not fortunate enough to have wireless television, you can still stream movies, youtube, and more to a televsion effortlessly).  Its not merely a gimmick either, as on normally the gpu is powering a 1920x1200 resolution screen, so its actually easier to power 1080p!\n\nIf you buy the docking stating, this device goes from great to near perfect!  A full sized usb port and sd card slot, along with the capacity of a full keyboard (which allowed me to type this review easily) are excellent features and in my opinion make the tablet very unique in its realm of competition.  Lastly, the expanded battery life; whenever the table goes below 70% and the docking station has battery life, it charges it back to around 90%.  Quite ingenious if you ask me.\n\nSoftware is also excellent; recently updated to Jellybean, Asus has a program which syncs all of the files, searches, and google play with your phone or PC, and I think also with mac but I think those users would prefer the significantly inferior Ipad 3...\n\nThe only con I could think of is that it has only a single speaker on the right side of the tablet when facing the user.  It is pretty loud, but it is easily covered as a result.  Not worth taking a star off, because I've been thoroughly impressed in every other aspect."}

I copied some music from my PC onto a micro SD card, plugged it into the tablet, and it was detected and useable immediately.

The email front end is very nice, since it permits incoming mail to be displayed from individual accounts, or as one combined view. On outgoing mail, (even via my ISP), it picked up and used my Gmail contact list. That encouraged me to combine several email contact lists, including my wife's, into one master contact list on Gmail. (Gmail tools for doing this are easy to use.) Then, even the ISP mail can use the master contact list. It also found the apps I had downloaded from Android Market (now renamed) onto my Android phone, and downloaded those to the tablet as well. I downloaded Skype and was video conferencing in minutes. Wow! I was getting more pleased by the minute.\n\nThen, since the tablet was delivered with Android Ice Cream Sandwich (4.0.3), I checked to download the expected Jelly Bean (4.1.1) update. Nothing there. I tried that for 4 more days, also posting questions on the ASUS site and Amazon BB. Everyone else seemed to be getting JB within a few hours of trying. Why was my Infinity a wallflower?  Then finally, after 5 days of hitting the \"check for updates button\", a large download arrived.  Hooray, I had Android 4.1.1!  Frankly, I could not tell much difference, but this was definitely not a scientific test. I wish the ASUS FAQ had said that it could take several days before the download of the update might happen. That would have prevented a lot of anxiety. My guess is that they are rationing capacity on their download servers.\n\nI also bought an ASUS USB adapter; a very small device that adapts the TF700's multiport to accept a USB device. Wanting to experiment, I plugged a 16 GB cheap generic USB stick from my car into the adapter, and within about 15 minutes had copied about 8.7 GB of my music from the stick to the tablet's internal 32 GB memory. I clicked on the music player icon on the screen (it's the orange headphone icon, third from the bottom right on the picture), and immediately got to play choices from my almost 3000 pieces of (mp3 and wma) music. The tablet allows me to sort the music in many ways - actually its better in displaying - sorting music choices than the (Clarion/Bose) system in my car. I also tried other media experiments including YouTube, emails with video attachments, and streaming PBS shows. All have worked well. So has the superb amazing Google voice recognition.\n\nI bought this unit because I wanted a large high end tablet to use as a \"couch-pad\" and to replace\nMy old Acer 8.9\" XP netbook for email when I travel. I wanted the unit to include a GPS, have the ability to easily do file transfers from memory sticks and cards, and not break the bank. (If possible, I also did not want to be dependent on the Apple universe, but my Ipad 1 and 2 experiences were so positive that I was willing to relax that restriction, if needed.) So far the TF700 fills the bill perfectly, at lower than Ipad cost.\n\nBUT, there is one key thing this unit does not do. It does not wirelessly mirror its screen to my TV like Apple Airplay/Apple TV and Intel WI-Di do. (I recently saw a great demo of this at our local computer club.) That is a big shortfall that I know is being worked on via methods such as Miracast. I tested a temporary solution via a 15' cheap HDMI cable to my TV, and the TF700 performed perfectly - streaming a PBS Upstairs Downstairs to my 65\" screen. I'm really hoping that the Android industry gets its act together quickly to provide wireless streaming like an ipad with Apple TV!\n\nExcept for that, thus far, the TF700 has done everything I have asked it to do, perfectly. It has the solid build and feel of a Lexus. It is definitely an outstanding product, especially at this price!"}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "After having my owned my Asus Infinity TF700 for one month, I just got the Jelly Bean OTA update -- no rooting required.  This is a solid update, to a excellent tablet.  I usually like to wait a bit before posting my technology reviews, so here's my review:\n\nPros:\n+Firstly, Amazing screen.  While it might not have the pixel density of Apple's Retina display, it offers Super IPS+ screen is very nice OUTSIDE in direct sunlight.  (Apple can't say that.)  It also features 16:9 resolution which is perfectly suited to widescreen movies.  Others who have seen my screen agree, it's nothing short of spectacular.  And in my everyday use, the Gorilla2 glass has kept my screen scratch free.\n\n+Secondly, the Android install is clean.  It comes with ICS (Android 4.0), but an update to Jelly Bean is available over the air, with no fuss.  The few Asus apps installed were actually useful -- like a file explorer, an excellent backup utility, and some cloud storage.  I prefer this to the bloatware, and modified operating system that other vendors offer.  (Asus' partnership with Google on the Nexus 7, is evidence of Asus' expertise with Android OS.)\n\n+Thirdly, an excellent camera that rivals my Point and Shoot camera.  It features a  F.2.2 lens with a 28-mm equivalent focal length.  Okay, I'll admit a tablet is a bit large for everyday photography.  But if you have with you, this device camera will outperform your smartphone.\n\n+Micro-MDHI port allows me to natively export the screen image to my LCD widescreen.  I use both direct-HDMI and HDMI to adapter for screen outputs.  (I had a problem with 1 older VGA projector, that couldn't handle the 1920 x 1200 screen resolution.) Overall, this feature is one more step toward using this as a laptop replacement.\n\n+Battery: I set my WiFi to turn off when the device is in sleep mode, and go DAYS (not hours) of casual use.  Even with non stop use, I still get over 9 hours of battery.\n\nNegatives:\nNo device is perfect.  And while these are shortcomings, these are minor and don't deter me from giving the device a full 5 stars.\n\n-Speaker: good quality, but it's not loud enough for anything more than personal use.  I compensate with a good Bluetooth wireless speaker.\n\n-Wifi: Although it works at 802.11n speeds, I still have some dead spots in my house...in the same places where my laptop works fine.\n\n-Android App EcoSystem is not large for tablets.  There are some fine apps out there, and I was surprised that a lot of business productivity apps are there (like WebEx, Citrix Goto Meeting, Juniper and Cisco SSL clients, etc...).  But as an example, Disney has ignored Android apps, so you'll see apps available for iPad that aren't available for Android.  Google knows this is a weak spot, and I see more tablet apps showing up.\n\nI'll wrap up by saying this has been a very addictive device -- quickly replacing my laptop for day to day use.  The default browser supports Flash, which allows me to view most web sites natively.  I've had no quality issues reported by other reviewers.  I purchased mine from BestBuy (sorry Amazon).  And I would have no problem recommending this for anyone looking for a top-of-the-line, Android based powerhouse.\n\nUpdate: after accepting all three OS updates from Asus, since buying this, my device has become painfully slow....like, \"I can't possibly use this for anything\" slow.  I'm beginning to wish I had gone with an iOS device.  With keyboard, cases, and unit, there was a lot of money invested into this purchase.  Now it's functionally useless.  I'm going to try doing a factory reset -- but the point is I shouldn't have to do that."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I'm going to start by saying that I really don't get the people that complain about light bleed! So far, I have owned this tablet for only a week but I have owned previous tablets longer than that. I have to say that my Toshiba tablet had NO light bleed to speak of. The sound on that one wasn't real great though. It also had no LED flash for the rear camera. The TF300T is a nice tablet by ASUS but, still no flash for the rear camera and the \"stereo\" speakers are placed far to the right of the back of the tablet as is the same with the TF700T which I am now using. It, however, does have an LED flash, a very bright one I might add. The folks that said the flash wasn't very bright, I don't know whom you were trying to kid. Now, the sound on this tablet isn't as good and rich sounding as the speakers for the TF300T, even though the placement is the same...to the far right in the back. That bothers me a little but not enough to send it back yet.\n\nAs far as that darn light bleed. Well, this one has one spot towards the bottom that is very noticeable and then a few areas towards the right of the screen that show up also. But you know what people, it is my experience that once that tablet is fully booted up and you have all the images on the screen and the auto brightness has adjusted itself to a mid level, the \"bleed\" is no longer noticeable. I don't understand the people that have huge complaints about it enough to say they returned their tablets because of it. The screen is very nice and very responsive. Even in IPS mode for outside viewing, I can barely tell of any light bleed and it surely isn't enough to project across my screen. If you are out in the bright sun with the IPS mode on and the bightness at full, the sun's rays still block out what you think one could detect as \"light bleed\" so again, I don't understand what all the fuss is about! It's still not bothering me enought to return the tablet. The one I really wanted actually was the Toshiba Excite but the reviews were much lower than this one. I still feel in some way I should've got the Toshiba instead (thus the 4 stars of this tablet). At least it places its \"stereo\" speakers as right and left side speakers and not just all the way on the right side. It also has an LED flash.\n\nI'm not really going to comment on what bloat software it comes with becaue I didn't feel it actually has all that much extra apps installed to worry about. I'm also not going to comment on how well it runs all that software. I have found that from tablet to tablet, they all pretty much do the same thing with just a little bit difference in the design. That part is just to each one's own preferance. I've done the system update to the newest android version. The tablet as a whole seems to function well. I would recommend it to my friends but I also would suggest that they might want to research more and and maybe check out the Toshiba Excite or other brands and come to their own conclusions."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I really wanted to like this tablet.  After about a week, I realized that it's just a big version of my Android phone and it's being returned.  If you are a casual web user that just surfs the web and uses Facebook and Twitter, this would likely suit you just fine. Read on for more...\n\nMy wife got an iPad and after playing around with it I decided I'd like to have a tablet too.  She loves the iPad and I felt that this device was pretty comparable in terms of performance and usability.  It is actually much lighter as well.  We recently had a 5 day vacation with 6 hours of flying on the first and last day.  It was nice having this device while flying, although I just used it as a big e-reader.  When we were staying at our friends' apartment the Asus was great in terms of having something compact and light to use for Facebook and replying to a couple of work emails. I used Skype too, although it crashed on me 3 times during a 20 minute conversation and required a reboot of the device.\n\nOnce I returned to work, I realized that there are still some limitations. Specifically, I tried taking notes during a couple of meetings and was tapping the screen really loudly trying to get spaces and was annoyed with having to select a separate button to get a tab (I do a lot of formatting in my notes).  I also tried Swype, which I'm ok with, but still was about 40% of the speed of me typing on a real keyboard.  Note that I did not buy the physical keyboard, which certainly could have helped.  However, I would then be spending $650 to have a device that doesn't do as much as my laptop.  The battery life would of course be longer with the Asus, but that's not a huge selling point for me.\n\nTo repeat, this technology is at the point where it can be really useful for casual users but I still like my physical keyboard (still have a phone with one), and cannot justify the $650 for a large version of my phone."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "At the moment, this is the best tablet available. It has plenty of storage space and supports up to a 32GB microSD card. It is light, thin, and comfortable to hold.\n\n== Jelly Bean ==\nAsus has recently released the update that will upgrade this tablet from ICS to Jelly Bean. Jelly Bean runs even better than ICS.\n\n== Battery ==\nThe battery will last up to 9 hours of constant use if you have it on eco-mode, otherwise the normal mode will give you 7-8 hours and power-mode with give you about 5-6 hours. If you also buy the keyboard add-on, you can expect to get about 4 more hours of life out of the battery.\n\n== Graphics ==\nThe video quality is nothing short of beautiful. It is a pleasure to view content on this tablet. Colors are vibrant, light colors are not too light, and dark colors are not too dark. Watching videos (whether through YouTube or Netflix) is great although the quality of the video is dependant on how fast your Internet connection is and whether you're watching high-def or standard-def video. If you have a fast connection and you're watching video in high-def quality, you won't be disappointed. Games like Dead Trigger which rely on a powerful GPU, look amazing and run without a hitch.\n\n== Sound ==\nThe speaker on this tablet is nothing to write home about, but it is decent. For me, it's ok for videos, but lacks oomph when listening to music. Most of the time I have headphones on.\n\n== Inputs ==\nMicroSD, micro HDMI, microphone, 2-in-1 headphone/microphone jack. Purchasing the dock will give you a full size USB port and full size SD card reader.\n\n== Camera ==\nThe camera is 8 MP and takes very nice, sharp looking photos. Although, if you use the digital zoom more than a few clicks the quality will degrade quickly. The front facing camera is a passable 1.5 MP, and I wish that it was of higher quality.\n\n== Last Word ==\nWhen tablets first came out I was skeptical about how useful they would really be, but after waiting, and making this my first tablet, I must say that I love this tablet. I use this it more than I use my desktop PC. Switching between apps is fast and simple. Surfing the Internet is easy and playing games on it is fun. I would recommend this to anyone looking to buy an Android tablet. It is simply the best one out there right now. Only a couple of other tablets even come close. I gaurantee you will be impressed and have no regrets."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I don't think I am going to really bother repeating stuff that has already been said in some other reviews. There are some reviews in here that do a really good job going into depth about this device.\n\nBasically, I have been using this for about 2 months now... have had the iPad (1 and 2) as well as several other tablets such as the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 as well as the Toshiba Excite 13. I have to say this is my most favorite table to use, the docking station that you have to buy is really worth it, because the functionality of the device improves overall. W/ the docking station you are prettying much running a tegra 3 quad processor netbook...\n\nthis thing is damn fast and for a tegra 3 device, the back doesn't get crazy hot when you put the device through some serious performance. I would highly reccomend this product, great screen, very clear and crisp (defenitely still not as good as the iPad's retina display) but you won't be disappointed. I would buy this again"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I researched this tablet purchase for a while, and ended up postponing my decision because I didn't really see much of a need for it in my life.  Then we had a baby, and the times we get to actually sit at a computer for an extended period became much more scarce, so the need for a tablet providing internet access and is always on, and easy to use while rocking the baby and sitting on the sofa became more important.\n\nI was deciding between this model, the TF300, and the Apple iPad.  I hate how Apple has a strangle-hold on what you do with your equipment, and really hated the limited memory and storage, so I didn't spend long looking at the iPad.  I mainly compared other tablets to the iPad to see if they were at least competitive.\n\nSo I was down to the TF700 and the TF300.  I wasn't sure how stuff would look on the higher resolution screen.  I didn't care about the extra $100 so much.  I also really liked the nice perks which come along on the TF700 (brighter screen, nicer glass, flash on the camera, metallic covering, etc), so I got the TF700.\n\nI've used it now for several weeks, and I'm loving it!  I'm happy to say videos look awesome on this screen.  Even the standard definition videos look awesome.  I was afraid only high-def would look nice on it.  The battery life seems good, but I haven't timed it.\n\nThe biggest issues I have are with the Android OS, which is fairly clunky.  Many things are just poorly designed, and the user interface is a bit clumsy.  For instance, I can't believe how annoying they build the standard email program.  Nothing works quite right, but it's good enough I guess.  I know I can probably find a replacement email program, but they really should get this right from the beginning and not depend on the user to replace it with another one.\n\nI remember the first time I used the email client on the iPod touch, and I never quibbled with it.  Everything just worked like I expected it to.  I guess that's the final polish that Apple puts on all their products.\n\nAnyway, I love the tablet, and how it's performed.  I highly recommend it.  I can't compare it to the TF300, because I don't have a TF300.\n\nHope this helps someone."}

Well, they came through.\nFollowing the latest firmware update, I followed the guide on TransformerFormus (dot) com and did a factory reset and cold boot (power off and hold the power and volume down button down for 10 seconds after the factory reset) and ALL of my issues were solved.  The lag has all been fixed.  The stock browser runs perfectly.  Amazingly, now the screen seems sharper.  I now prefer this over my iPad 3.\n\nWell done Asus, better late than never, I guess!\n****************************\n\n(Original 3 star review)\nFirst of all, I'm a big android fan.  I got the Galaxy Nexus phone on release day.  On the Nexus, Jelly Bean works great.\n\nI got the tf700 when it had ICS.  It now has Jelly Bean and despite cold booting etc as described on TransformerForums and the xda forums, it is no faster than it was on ICS.  I also have an iPad 3 (I hate Apple and refuse to call it the \"new\" iPad) because it had/has the best screen.  IMO it is still the best tablet as far as performance, but I hate the iOS ecosystem as I'm a geek and frigging hate the Apple playpin.  I also have a Kindle Fire HD... though the processor is not faster, the overall experience is less laggy and web browsing is faster than the Infinity.\n\nCons:\n\n\"Would you like to wait or close your browser.\"  I specifically waited until the Jelly Bean update to post the review because I heard this would be resolved.  It is not.  If I had a nickel for every time I got this message I would be rich.\n\nSpeed.  Over all it is slow.  It is the slowest responding device I have, including the Fire HD, Galaxy Nexus phone, and iPad 3.er\n\nTop Heavy:  falls over.  They should have put a bigger battery in the keyboard or something so it would not topple off the couch/bed etc.  This is a minor complaint.\n\nGoogle Play Magazines: Text is fuzzy and not optimized for an HD display.  Zinio puts google play magazines to shame.  Performance of these magazines really, really, sucks on the Infinity.\n\nSpeakers:  Arguably the world's worst speaker, edging out the iPads speaker on suckiness.  The Fire HD speakes put them both to shame.\n\nWifi:  The iPad and Fire HD have a 5 ghz antenna so the microwave does not cause the browser to crash every time I turn it on, as it does on the Infinity.\n\nPros:\n\nThe screen is nice.\n\nThe transformer concept is nice, though Windows Surface is going to strip that advantage out.  I do like the option of using the trackpad or tablet.\n\nOverall, I would not recommend this to others.  I will sell it as soon as I get a 8.9 Fire HD.  While the Amazon ecosystem is limited, I just sideload google play apps, overcoming any restrictions.  The new Windows Surface tablets have low ppi screens, so I'll wait on those.\n\nIf Asus fixes the sluggishness and glitchiness that should not be associated with this processor or OS before I sell it, I may keep it and will update.  ********Edit 11-5-2012 I now recommend this unit without reservation.  Probably really a 4.5 / 5 stars just because they don't have dual band like the Fire HD,  iPad 4, and Nexus 10 but everything after the latest update, cold reboot, factory reset, is fixed.  Wow!***************"}

Soon thereafter, Asus pushed Jelly Bean and I am now running Jelly Bean.\n\nLet me start with the positive points: fast; powerful; clear high quality screen; good graphics; great optimization potential; and moderately OK battery life.  I selected this device over the iPad since it has a micro HDMI port, I can add memory cards, I own an Android phone, PCs, etc. . . For me, an iPad made little sense since I have no apple products.  What I sought was a quality product that could do what I need without having to purchase an iPad.  I loaded a graphic heavy Tegra THD application (ahem, game) and the graphics are fantastic and it runs well.  For the most part, it does everything well, but there are some downsides.  The downsides have nothing to do with the quality of the product, but with the application market as noted below.\n\nNegatives:  it has WiFi but no 4g/3g (but I didn't want that anyway), and the only glaring negative relates to applications, or better yet, the lack of applications that are available and optimized for this or any Android tablet.  For example, there is no Amazaon.com application available for this device.  Ironic considering where I purchased the product.  That is not the only missing application.  My cell phone has a number of applications that do not exist for tablets or are not optimized for an android tablet.  It is rather frustrating to try to load an application that is on my phone, but unavailable for my tablet.  It is less frustrating, but somewhat annoying that some applications that work on my phone work on my tablet but are not optimized for the tablet; therefore, the graphics on the application appear fuzzy and \"old-school\".  The best example is the Safeway application.  It looks and works great on my phone, but on the tablet, it looks like I took the application with great graphics, blew it up in size about five times, and then pasted it onto the tablet.  It looks horrible.  The GUIs are fuzzy, it does not rotate when I rotate the screen, etc. . .\n\nConclusion:\nOverall, it is a great product EXCEPT the application market is weak.\n\nThere are prior updates about quality control.  My device has no issues.  QC issues may be limited.  Finally, Asus was very quick to push Jelly Bean onto this device. I applaud Asus for not sitting on their laurels and pushing Jelly Bean out quickly."}

Since bringing it home I have grown increasingly frustrated with it.  I first opened the internet browser, and found it to be pretty slow.  Netflix is very sluggish on it.  The screen response is...horrible. You have to push something sometimes several times for the pad to acknowledge a click, either that or the browser is so clunky and slow it seems like you have to reclick because it isn't responding.  The facebook function on the pad is highly frustrating.  If you are typing a message on facebook and want to click back somewhere to edit something, you tap and a little magnified viewer will pop up to show you where the cursor will drop when you let go.  When you let go, it plops the cursor anywhere but where it said it was going to put it.  It doesn't have photoshop like the Samsung note, no swype, you have to download some knockoff of swype to use it that annoyingly puts a space after the . in any internet address.  The device just doesn't seem well polished.  It has great specs on paper, but functionally it's not really all that in my mind.  I can type facebook messages faster and with less hair pulling on my old Samsung Galaxy phone!  The camera is nice, but the software interface with it is non-intuitive. The glare on the screen is pretty intense too if there is any other light in the room at all.  I think I'm going to take it back and either get the Samsung note or wait and see if the new Kindle HD coming out Nov 20 turns out to be worth while.

It is very responsive to the touch and very smooth with Android's graphics and screen animations. I have to add though, I was very impressed with the WiFi antenna of this Asus tablet. It picks wireless signals stronger and faster than other tablets I have had in the past including the iPad. I also own a Google Nexus 7 (which is made by Asus as well) and it is exactly the same with the WiFi antenna. When using it at home, other tablets were showing poor signal quality if I was outdoors, but this one shows a strong signal and it proves it by being able to browse the Internet fast.\n\nFinally, I got myself a pen for taking handwritten notes with the SuperNote app, and I am in pen heaven!

I was sold that the Asus Infinity was the iPad killer.  However. . .\n\nThe unit I had (now returned) was functionally fine, and had no hardware issues that I could identify.  Got a day + of battery with modest use.  Lots of features and options.  Lots of apps BUT: Sporadicly sluggish and crashy when web browsing and using apps like Facebook. Doing very simple things like commenting on a Facebook post or, just scrolling a webpage.  I tried 5 different browsers to find the right one, and while each had its pluses and drawbacks, none would work as smoothly as expected.  Scrolling was snaggy sometimes where the page would just lock up and the browser would want to force close.  The other big issue is the typing interface is inconsistently sluggish. Sometimes reacting as fast as I can type, other times (randomly) lagging so badly that I would have to type a few characters, wait a few seconds to see what was recognized, then type some more. . . .  I also tried 4 different keyboards in addition to the standard one that ships with the device and none gave me the smooth and consistant input I expected.  My Droid Razr Maxx works more smoothly when typing than this $500 tablet does.  I had the tablet for about 3 weeks but was ready to return it after a few days but decided to wait for the Jelly Bean update hoping that it would fix the sluggish issues.  After the update, while I would say that it was somewhat improved, it was still not where it should be.\n\nI really didn't want to go to the iPad (for all of the reasons you'd expect) but, after spending quite a bit of time (hours in total) literally A/B ing the Infinity with the iPad at an Apple store and again at a Best Buy, I came to the reluctant realization that like it or not, the Infinity (or maybe the Android Tablet OS itself?) is just not up to the same level of refinement and functionality that the iPad is."}

I really like the thin, light and HD screen.  When I hooked up my hot spot the connection shot through the roof in fast motion. Once I place it on the mobile dock I forget that this is a tablet because it feel like a computer. I even got the amazon kindle app for ebooks so I can finish reading my books. As far as school is concern this convertible tablet pc will be just fine. I have not found any glitches yet even though its too early in the game and I hope not. I really enjoy this device and Im happy that I purchase it."}

It would be really nice if the battery lasted longer, but you do hwve three different power options: power saver, balanced, or performance (you can probably guess which modes do what).  The optional keyboard ( bought separately) really expands what you can do with the tablet.  It has a full keyboard (pretty easy to use) and increases the battery life of the device -- although the odd part is that the battery in the keyboard works by apparently charging the battery in the tablet.  I have very little complaints to make about it.  The screen resolution is fantastic, and with all the android apps out there, you can get everything you need to easily rivsl any product by Apple.  I take it with me everywhere and use it all the time -- even now!\n\nI highly recommend this tablet for those looking for a competetive alternative to Apple's product line."}

The tablet has wonderful features and everything works without a hitch!  The cameras are wonderful as well as the screen.  I do not have any problems with acquiring my WI-FI signal anywhere.  I have moved aroung the house and never loss the signal. The tablet is fast.  I enjoy playing games and find it to be wonderful.  The apps that come with it are excellent for work.  I do prefer to use Documents-To-Go and it work!  I have received the Jelly Bean update already!  Second, with the keyboard it almost replaces my laptop.  The keyboard works great and Asus has fixed any problems with it.  I am a trained electronic technician and prefer to control my own enviornment.  I do not always want to do it the Apple way.  I am glad us Android users have a tablet that can rival the IPAD!!!  By the way, get the 64GB version if you can afford it!"}

But the GPS STILL DOESN'T WORK PROPERLY.\n\nC'mon, Asus makes the Google Nexus tablet.  How can they make both that and this and the 200 dollar one works whereas the 550 dollar one does not?  This isn't rocket science.\n\nUsing GPSTest, the Nexus 7 locks 7+ satellites inside my house in about 10 seconds, outside on the front steps, it locks 11 in about 30 seconds, and never loses a fix.\n\nUsing GPSTest on the TF700, it sees on average 3 less satellite signals than the Nexus 7, and never locks a signal with more than 4 or 5 at a time.\n\nCan't think that it's a hardware issue, since it doesn't lock on satellites that it sees a signal from, for unknown reason.  You would think after all of the trouble Asus went through with the original TF Prime they would make sure the one thing thing that caused them all that grief would work on the next tablet.  Apparently not..\n\nEDIT:  After Googling around it appears that there's a Jellybean update that was not pushed to this tablet when I started it for the first time.  To make sure I factory reset it and it still wasn't pushed.  Downloaded and updated the official ROM manually and tried the GPS again.  As of now, I get comparable performance outdoors as the Nexus 7 (10 to 11 satellite views and locks in GPSTest), but still none near windows indoors where the Nexus 7 has no issues.  Comparing GPS 'versions' between updates there are several version numbers of difference.  So that confirms my earlier suspicion, it's a software issue, that they are at least attempting to resolve.\n\nSo the GPS failure was compounded by the update failure.  After I took the trouble to manually fix the problems myself (for which all information came from random forums, mind you, none published by Asus up to and including manual update procedures) I kinda got it working.  Of course there are no apparent release notes detailing what they have worked on between ICS and JB either.  It's a crap shoot, you get what you get!  Someone who wasn't as familiar with these things would probably just assume that the GPS was broken and return it to Amazon 2 or 3 times then give up."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I've had this for about 6 weeks.  I am very pleased with the functionality of this tablet.  I was torn between this and the Ipad 3 or saving some money and getting the Asus T300.  I felt like this was the best bang for my buck.  Very solid, well made and good quality.  Everything has worked smoothly.  Love the camera and video camera.  Nice clear quick photos.  Not too cumbersome like I worried I t might be.  Plenty of apps.  Turned it into a phone and can make/receive calls/texts.  Wifi signal is better than all my other wifi capable devices.  Not sure why others complain about the speaker.  It's quite loud for a tablet.  No complaints there.  Upgraded to jelly bean, a bit smoother but IC sandwich was pretty smooth anyway.  Enabled the remote through splash top so that I can access the desktop.  Pretty much does everything.  One thing I don't care for is the placement of the charge port.  It's right at the bottom which makes it cumbersome with the case that I bought for it.  I can't stand it up in the slot.  Haven't gotten the keyboard yet, haven't had a need too.  Did order a USB adapter.  I really like that it is expandable.  Excellent resolution.  I couldn't see much difference from the Ipad."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "Can't add a whole lot to what has already been discussed in these reviews, but I do want to point out a few things to folks that are considering purchasing an Android Tablet.\n\n1.  If you're trying to decide which wireless Android tablet to purchase, and having 4G is NOT a determining factor for you, then the ASUS TF-700 is the Gold Standard.  It is quite simply the best Android tablet on the market right now.  Screen resolution, response, camera, design, bundled software and ASUS support, etc...all top of the line.  Does that mean it is the end-all be-all?  Not necessarily.  You will still find yourself wandering over to your Laptop for certain tasks.  For instance; If you're an avid Facebook user, the Android platform (on ANY Android Tablet) simply does not provide a complete Facebook experience equal to what you will find when using your Windows 7 Notebook Computer.  You might find similar limitations with other apps too.  Also, Finding, Moving, Organizing, Cutting and and Pasting files and text is all a bit clunky too, but again this is more a shortfall of the Android operating system rather than a fault of this particular model. If any of this sounds like an absolute deal breaker, you may want to consider waiting to see what Windows 8, has to offer.  Rumors are that Windows 8 will, at least in theory, redefine the tablet experience.  But if you're already an avid Google app & operating system user...Then look no further, this is the tablet for you.\n\n2. If you've kicked tires on Android Tablets enough to agree with the fact that the ASUS TF-700 is for you, and you are ready to purchase, DO NOT HESITATE to buy the keyboard as an optional accessory.  It is a must.  Many reviews have complained that the keyboard is cramped, but I have found it no more difficult to use than a standard netbook laptop keyboard, and it really will complete your experience with the Tablet and make your life much easier.\n\n3. So you store a lot of files; music, pictures and movies and you're worried that even at 64GB, the ASUS TF-700 may still not supply enough room.  Keep in mind that you've got a micro SD slot on the tablet itself, and with the Keyboard attachment you can add ANOTHER SD card!  This means you can add up to an additional 128 GB of space; (2) 64GB SD cards.  Many people have talked about the possible limitation of adding 32GB SD cards but I added 2 64GB's SD Cards with no problem.  ASUS also has a \"Cloud\" back up drive system that will allow you even more room for your stuff.\n\n4.  Buy glass cleaner and some soft cloths for constant wiping down...you'll need it...it's just part of the deal when dealing with a touchscreen system.\n\n5.  Enjoy, it really is a wonderful piece of equipment and perhaps the best Android toy on the market right now."}

All of which has never giving me any problems.\nKind of like a love/hate relationship with ASUS. I like several of there products but Im really disappointed in there tablets.\n\nIve now have had to return two of the TF700T tablets back to Amazon. The first tablet had a defective screen. I understand that with electronics there is always a possiblity with a \"lemon\" here and there. Thats just the nature of electronical devices. Fine... I returned it with Amazons great return policy and received the replacement.\n\nSeveral days of using the replacement I noticed that when left charged overnight the tablet woudn't fully charge. Odd..I'll keep using it and see what happens during the next charge. Well the tablet finally got down to the point were I needed to charge it again. I turned off the tablet and \"plugged\" the charger into the tablet. Nothing, know charger indicator light (orange/red light) came on. I then tired to power the tablet back on. Nothing, tablet doesn't want to power back on.\nI tried holding down the power button for 3 secs...nothing. I then tried the 30 second hard reset..this didn't do anything. I thought maybe it might be the charger itself. I took a USB flash drive device with light.. and \"plugged\" it into the the tablets wall charger. The light on the USB flash drive came on. Okay the wall charger works fine.\nWow...Ive had the second tablet for less then a week and its already died on me.\nLemon number two.\nThe tablet came with ICS. On the second day of owning the tablet I upgraded it to Jelly Bean. Im not certain if this is the problem with the tablet or not. Just pointing this out.\n\nTo make matters even worse. I purchased two Nexus 7 (for my boys) at around the same time I originally purchased the TF700T. As we all know, the Nexus 7 is also made by ASUS. Yes, one of the Nexus 7 sreens has a defect. It looks milky white/cloudy with some \"burn\" retention on the screen. I didn't purchase it from Amazon, but from Google itself. Called them and I will receive the replacement today.\nSo when it comes down to ASUS and there tablets. I won't be buying another one. As for other products from this company. I wouldnt think twice about not buying from them. I just feel there tablets arnt up to par."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "It is sad a tablet with many glowing reviews can be so poorly constructed.  I bought it because of reviews from several magazines and I think the reviewer should be ashamed for giving this product such high marks when the quality is so poor.  I actually went through three of TF700T's before I just gave up and bought a Samsung TAB2.  on every TF700, the glass was not seated against the body, it would only be a short time before debris would make its way in between the glass and the monitor.  the first one just felt 'cheap' holding it in my hands I could feel the edges flex and the glass protrude particularly in the corners.  The screen looks great but for some reason when streaming videos is has periods where it has a brain freeze, then you miss a couple of seconds of video and off you go again.  The router is just 20 feet away.  We have two other computers (dell and Alienware) and they have never had a problem streaming video.  The Samsung TAB2 may not have as high a resolution as the TF700 - but I've had it a week, perfect fit and finish, not a blip in watching movies or doing a bit of real office work here and there.  The spec's pointed toward the TF700 but the reality - what really matters, Samsung was superior in every way.  By the way, Asus technical support people are very demeaning and difficult to deal with, not had to try Samsung's support but if they are civil and polite it would be a better than my experience with Asus."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "Overall reasonably good product, I think I would gave it 5 stars, if not for one thing that is kind of unacceptable in a commercial product.\n\nThe problem is that, at least with the first JB OTA update, the device would sometimes (unpredictably) freeze or reboot. This is  actually the first time I encounter Android device doing that, so I am quite surprised and rather disappointed, and I would certainly expect Asus to do better.\n\nSince this happens less-then-deterministically (I observed about 3 instances during the ~week since I got it) certainly I doubt this could be addressed efficiently by any service center; not sure if the issue is caused by problem in kernel, some driver, or the actual hardware.\n\nOne would think that for a ~$500 device its manufacturer could have put some effort into testing and overall quality assurance...\n\nUpdate (17-Oct-12): OK, it indeed appears that full factory reset with data wipe solved the issue: I have been using the device for a week since that and observe no problems. Thanks for the suggestions.\n\nUpdate (21-Oct-12): Today I registered one (the first in these two weeks since full reset) spontaneous shutdown (the device just went black-screen, like it normally does upon inactivity timeout, and then went through full powerup/boot-up sequence once I press power).\n\nWill be keeping a log of reboots here, for the sake of transparency, as apparently Asus uses its customers as beta-testers:\n 22-Oct-12: Firmware OTA update (second one from original JB upgrade) (JRO03C.US_epad-10.4.4.18-20121012)\n 24-Oct-12: #1 freeze (upon \"recent tasks\" button press)\n 27-Oct-12: #2 freeze (upon flipping page in FB reader, after doing so for two hours). OK, resetting back to 1 star, where it should belong now (~alfa-testing).\n  1-Nov-12: #3 freeze (upon task switch to Google Translate: white screen and subsequent reboot).\n  5-Nov-12: #4 freeze (upon skype start: screen went blue and froze in that state: just blue, perhaps with one scanline black at top).\n  6-Nov-12: Brought the device to the local authorized service center [...] according to ASUS support recommendation (quoting email of ASUS TSD \"It''s not normal. And I can''t tell you it''s a hardware issue or a software issue. We need to have a check on that.\").\n 10-Nov-12: Service returned the tablet, with verdict \"Firmware updated, tested, all OK\". I see firmware upgraded to JRO03C.US_epad-10.4.4.20-20121026 indeed.\n  OK, right after ~an hour of working with it, the screen went black (while in Google Play, after pressing on some application's screenshot there), and booted subsequently after a few seconds timeout...\n 21-Nov-12 -- admittedly the longest problem-free run ended with new strange situation. After being charged for whole night, the device would not turn on: it did not respond to power button, occasionally the screen turned on, showing low battery warning, but usually went black in a couple of seconds. Managed to reboot it, after that worked normally (recognizing fully charged battery and turning on normally).\n 23-Nov-12 #6 freeze, upon opening google maps (after selecting action, pressing \"just once\", screen went white and frozen)\n 28-Nov-12 #7 freeze, while switching from Google Play to home desktop.\n  2-Dec-12 #8 freeze, while opening QuickPic application (black screen, then I guess watchdog-triggered reboot)\n 19-Dec-12 Firmware OTA update to 10.4.4.23-20121127\n 19-Dec-12 #9 freeze, while scrolling PDF page in Polaris office: screen (white with black text) went uniform grey, with the familiar 1-scan line black near the top and froze. I think that's the first time when the event was not associated with the change of active application. Too bad, I hoped this update would fix the issue...\n 20-Dec-12 #10 freeze, while browsing in the default internet browser\n 22-Dec-12 #11 freeze -- device apparently switched off while switching to a different task in \"recent apps\" menu.\n\nSorry for the frequent updates, but this whole thing with this tablet starts to feel like some practical joke. And I thought this was \"the best Android tablet on the market\"...\n\nOne thing _is_ deterministic though -- every time the unit freezes, its screen is filled with constant color (can be different each time), save for one black scan line a couple of lines below its top. So it looks like the problem can be traceable to some particular screen update event.\n\nOh, and did I say that Asus support is on par with their product? I have communicated with quite a number of people in US, Russia and probably Taiwan, mostly having problems getting single coherent response... The final verdict apparently is that I need to take the tablet to an authorized service center (which I did, and where they did not see any problem), get the device back, then bring it to the service again if the issue re-surfaces (which it obviously does at some point), go to step 1, loop. Excellent business model, I'd say, assuming one can sustain it...\n\nOh, and the official policy is of course that \"if anything is installed except the software that came with the device -- then Asus is not responsible for anything\". I fail to understand how possibly can a java VM application cause system-level freeze, but apparently Asus knows better... :)"}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I was expecting a super fast tablet with everything I've read and heard about the Asus Infinity. Instead, it's performance is just ok. It doesn't always respond when I click on something. Often times when I select the 'view apps' icon (in the botton left next to home), it doesn't list recently opened apps. Instead, it takes a screen capture. It's only supposed to do this if I hold the icon down for 3 seconds, not tap it. Needless to say, I have several screen captures on the system.\n\nWhen viewing images, they take a while to load and fully render on the screen. The image is first partially loaded and looks blurry. A couple of seconds later, the rest of the picture is loaded, so the blurriness is gone. About 3-4 seconds on average for a typical image to completely load. When you're going through your picture gallery, that's not a desireable wait for each picture. It's much faster on my Motorola Atrix, and much better on an ipad.\n\nHas a lot of other positives though, including design, the Asus live wallpapers, and Android interface including widgets. Does pretty well with Riptide and other games, which is surprising with the mediocre performance for things like web browsing, viewing images, and just navigating the sytem.\n\nCheck it out first at Best Buy or local Electronics store to make sure you're comfortable with it."}

If it only had more of a quality assurance (QA) work in the manufacturing process, it would have been a great tablet.

My initial return was due to my touch input going crazy and sluggishness. I own a Toshiba Thrive and Motorola Xoom and never had these kind of issues. Also tried the latest firmware update 10.4.4.16 with same results. When people spend almost $ 500 for a unit it is really a hassle to work with ASUS tech support. ASUS is a great company, don't get me wrong, but this tablet needs serious QA before shipping. I feel I need to tell others about this so that the company can get the product right.

I am sure that the tablet can do many more tasks than I will ever use, but so far the device has performed flawlessly. There are several things that I don't like - the 700F does not recognize or use Adobe, which limits some of the tasks that I wanted to do. Additionally, the User Manual that comes with the device is about 4 2X4 pages. Being a first-time user, it doesn't even tell you how to unlock the device. I believe that the paperwork that is supplied is sorely lacking. The only thing that I can say, is that the manual can be ascertained on-line.

They immediately set up a return for me and even scheduled the UPS driver to pick up my tablet the next morning, which was great being in my line of work, I really did not have much time to hunt around for a UPS store to drop it off myself.  They also sent me a new replacement tablet which I received a few days later.  This one is flawless.  I am absolutely impressed with the tablet itself as it does everything as advertised, and then some.  The screen resolution is awesome and even better than the Apple 3's in my opinion, and it has more processing power for any app. that I will ever use it for.  As a side note, I downloaded a few of the games made for this tablets processing and graphical capabilities, and WOW!!!, it is hard to believe they can make games that complicated for such a small computing device.  The graphics are awe stricking for a tablet, and, they even have \"The Bards Tale\" for those of us \"old-timers\" from the eighties era Apple II or Comodore 64 gamers.  I am, as stated before, absolutely impressed with Amazon, and of course, Asus.  In my opinion, if you are looking for a tablet that is both powerfull in processing and graphics, along with expandable, than this tablet is for you.  You will not be disappointed.  Asus really came to bat with this tablet and pretty much gave us everything we wanted in a tablet computer.  Thank you Asus, and thank you Amazon, for going above and beyond in your customer service.  Bob S."}

The connector I am not pleased about, no usb ports,the power chord is very thin and flimsy\n\nI am a proud owner of a Toshiba Thrive. It got full and my baby brother offered me $150 for it if I got another one. I loved my Thrive. I loved the 64 gb full sd card. Toshiba is not shipping Thrives anymore, but still is very usable. I was a happy camper.\n\nAs a lady, I don't need another new fangled gadget. BUT. Well needless to say, I let him sucker me into spending money. I am glad he did. That no need turned it to I gotta have.\n\nFirst of all. This tablet flys. I compared it in the store with the  New Toshiba Excite, Samsung Note, Asus has a bigger engine and the ram is faster. The screen is beautiful. If you make it to bright you can see faint lines. SO DON\"T MAKE IT BRIGHT. This was cheaper than the Samsung, but more expensive than the Toshiba. But the power makes it worth the money.\n\nThe expandable micro Sd cards prices came down, So I was able to get another 64 GB. This added more memory since I bought the 32 gb version.  I am able to get all my music, videos, and kiddie pix on that.  So make sure you get one.\n\nTheir are no USB ports. You can get an adapter that turns the power connector to a USB.  That is what I loved about the Toshiba.  You can connect a lot to it.  However, in the year I had it, I used the usb connector just once.  There are plenty of cute covers to trick it out.\n\nThe machine updated itself that took out some kinks that was previously mentioned.  Except for the angry birds space premium Issue, All my apps have transferred over.\n\nGET THIS ONE. It is worth the money.\n\nThis product is... Easy to set up and is lightning fast, Good sound quality, Great screen size\nAbout me...

I\"ve had mine almost 2 months now and its working well at the moment. Since then my tablet freezed up like 3 times total where the screen goes white and it restarts but  since asus recent update i haven't gotten any crashes since they probably fixed the problem. The  battery life for me seems to be around 7hours of use while using wifi and playing games, i also download alot of torrents as well so battery life seems fair but i had expected more. The hd screen is nice and the camera is quite good videos recorded in 1080p looks great. I\"ve had trouble getting FLASH player working since adobe decide to stop supporting flash player on mobile devices but got it working in d end btw im currently on ice cream sandwich, jelly bean is due sometime next week cant wait to try it out. Also if ur into flashing new roms and sort there is a software out where it makes ur tf700t unbrickable which is awesome.  Overall i love this table would recommend to anyone, tablet is fast and has great specs, games run flawless an looks great, for me id say its the best tablet out at the moment. I LOVE IT 5 STARS."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I wanted to love this device. Stock Android looks gorgeous, full HD screen, fantastic metal casing, thin... But alas...\n\nDisclaimer: I had the latest official update running on all of the devices, plus I experimented with 4.1.1 ROMs from XDA.\n\nI have gone through three different Infinities within a week. The first one had a screen detachment issue. Judging by the forums, this is a very common problem. After taking it back, I got the device on which the screen started flickering after only a day or so of use. It quickly became unusable. The third device was not good, it was \"least bad\". The screen had severe light bleeding problems, and I just couldn't get myself to drive to BestBuy again (it's an hour away) and exchange it for the 4th device.\n\nThe very usage of device is, again, not bad. However, I can't for the life of anything figure out why does Asus put cheap components in their tablets? The Tegra 3 is great, but what's the point of it when you're going to put a cheap, slow NAND memory module that will make the true multitasking (and I mean the tablet downloading something in the background, and me using it without any problems) almost impossible because of the lag? And all of the three devices had this problem.\n\nLots, lots of games would crash at random. I have had many android devices and I've never seen this happen. No force close message, nothing, just bam, you're back on the desktop. Takes me back to Windows 98/XP days when games would CTD (crash to desktop).\n\nAt other times, during normal usage, the tablet would sometimes just decide to start lagging like hell. At one moment it would be super fast, the next moment I would have to wait for 5 seconds for it to open an app drawer. I am not sure, but I would attribute this to the cheap on-board memory.\n\nAsus really needs to improve its QC and stop putting in cheap components! I have a laptop from Asus as well and I could practically write the same review for it as I just did.\n\nGot myself a Galaxy Note 10.1 finally, after about a week of \"struggling\" with thESE deviceS. Despite the lower resolution screen, I could not be happier with my decision. The Note 10.1 is always snappy and responsive.\n\nIf this were a $349 device or even a $399, I would rate it 5 stars and say it's the best device ever. But when you're competing (in the price range) with the new iPad and the Galaxy Note 10.1, you need to come up with a great device. Specs don't just matter on paper, they need to show themselves in real life as well. The latter is not the case with Asus."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I've been looking at tablets for years.  I jumped on the iDevice bandwagon with iPhone 3, 3gs, then 5.  But, iPad?  I just couldn't get into Apple's heavy-handed approach to chaining their devices to our necks with a padlock which only they could open.  The iPad has no sd sockets, no expansion memory, no USB.  Other features such as video output comes only at the expense of additional black boxes.  Apple does not permit us mere mortals to save a file from the Internet.  The clincher came when they began censoring some of the apps which I had already purchased because they allow access to the web where (gasp) a dirty photograph might be posted.  Oh, enough already!\n\nI've never seen Android before.  With names like Ice Cream Sandwich and Jellybean, not really installing a lot of confidence in me.  But, ok - let's take the plunge.  I bought the Asus.  The worst thing I've heard about them is that the x. 26 firmware is having problems with WiFi and updating to the newer x. 30 - which fixes the WiFi and connection problems.  But, how do you get the firmware onto the tablet?  Asus suggested a factory reset.  That didn't do it.\n\nThe firmware is available on their website, but their own website could not identify their own tablet.  (sigh)  I needed to enter the serial number to find the downloads available.  Careful: Asus states clearly that you can turn your device into a paperweight by loading the incorrect file.  It seems more likely that you will use the wrong language file and your device will come up in Chinese when you reboot.  So, choose wisely.\n\nI downloaded the x. 30 firmware which was zip file inside of another zip file.  No instructions.  Asus tech support wouldn't even tell me the procedure!  So, after some google'ing, the trick is to put the second zip file onto a micro SDHC card, press the vol down and power buttons for 8 seconds and wait for the tablet to reboot.  A notification will come up in a few moments once the system recognizes the update.  Open the notification, follow the prompts, and sweat it out for 10-15 minutes.  Oh, be sure you have a fully charged battery before you begin.\n\nGetting that far took several hours - it should have taken 30 minutes, but instructions are scarce.  I only know of iPhone, so this is my first exposure to the Android platform.  And I say, \"nice.\"  I see why Apple hates Google.  After installing an FTP client and server app, I just dragged my iTunes music folder onto the root directory of the internal storage card.  Music.  Done.  It will play non-protected Apple-encoded files, so I didn't need to convert to MP3's.  Sweet.  Video?  Same thing, just drag and drop.  The resolution is higher on the Asus (much higher than iPad) so some re-sampling is in order.  I paid for a good video player app and it all looks great.\n\nNetflix streaming.  Nice.  Now I don't even need to copy movies.  I can just WiFi them.  Speakers are ok - well, kinda ok in a pinch.  The camera is just awful, but I'm not using it for taking pictures.  I saw a firmware update fly by for the camera.  It didn't help much.  Most apps for iPhone had counterparts for Android, except none of the banking apps are compatible.  ah, but for everything else there's a real, full-sized web browser.  No sense developing an app for a tablet when the browser does it already, probably better.\n\nI forget sometimes that I'm not on a laptop until I try to do something \"advanced\" like examine my cookies.  Then, ah - where are all my settings?  This tablet is replacing my old IBM Thinkpad for travel.  I did look hard at Apple's McAir notebook, but it's so expensive and overkill for travel.  I just want to surf, email, play movies and music, maybe FTP or SSH for emergency IT situations.  This tablet has you covered.\n\nScreen response to touch varies with the application.  It lags a bit, but not too annoying.  The text is clean and crisp with great fonts.  Not quite up to iPad retina display standards, but I'd rather have function over looks.  If you've never seen an iDevice you'll never complain about this screen.\n\nDoing some research I've read there's some confusion over the t700 dock (keyboard) being a re-labeled 201 keyboard.  Asus is denying it.  Now the keyboard stocks are dwindling.  What's the word for that?  I am not... confident.  I did not buy one either.  If you want to sell me a t700 dock, it should say t700 all over it - on the package, in the firmware, and in the part number.  No?  Keep it.\n\nDespite a few flaws, I've rated it 5 stars as \"best for the price.\"  It's not iPad, nor is it over-priced as one.  It requires a special charge adapter, as all tablets do these days.  Asus says you *can* charge it with a conventional USB port, but only with the unit sleeping with the screen off.  And, the chargers are over-priced.  You'll also need a special cable to connect to the charger.\n\nIn less than a day I had my tablet customized with music, video, and a handful of apps.\n\nDon't like WiFi and say you want LTE?  Google the words Mobile Hotspot and you might find what you need."}

I was becoming a fan of your products.\n\nOriginally bought a transformer tf300 and it was perfect, I decided to upgrade and gave it to my wife, so I bought the Infinity. I was very anxious to receive it and have a better experience,because supposedly, is a superior product. But what a disappointment, many problems with it. Mainly with the performance, really bad, as it constantly freezes the screen, is much slower than the tf300 and I had to reset twice because it was not working at all. I did the factory reset, but it is the same.\n\nThe other big problem is with the screen, when the screen is black, on the shores are white light parts, is terribly flawed.\n\nI am really ashamed to \"show off my new tablet\" I bought.

Oddly enough I wanted the Champagne Gold color since I felt the Amethyst Grey was a bit too purple for my taste.  So I bought my wife the Amethyst Grey and patiently waited for the Champagne Gold Model with 64GB.  Over two months passed and I gave up, although I still have the order with Amazon.com I plan to cancel it shortly.  I decided to buy from another online retailer as they were a few bucks cheaper and had them in stock and seemed to have a reasonable return policy.  I received the tablet on Friday (21-Sept-12) and love it..  I set my wife's up (bought from BestBuy with a bunch of gift cards) and loved hers and jealously waited for mine to come from Amazon.com.  I don't think it ever will..\n\nThere really is no difference between the Champagne and the Amethyst Grey model, other than the obvious color of the back plate.  I know a lot of people are mad at the other reviewers saying you are slanting the review of this product, but someone who really wants to buy this tablet will more than likely read the Amethyst Grey model reviews.  I am not sure why Amazon.com didn't combine the product page with an option for color.\n\nThis honestly is the best Android tablet in the market today.  I will add a more in depth review shortly, but it will more than likely be a rehash of what people said for the Amethyst Grey model.\n\nAlso, I gave up waiting for the dock from Amazon.com and bought it from Walmart as they have it in stock and with tax it was a few bucks cheaper than Amazon.com originally listed it for!\n\nCheers!"}

After several purchases of 10\" tablets (and immediate returns), I am extremely happy with the Asus Transformer Infinity!  What really sold me is the ability to transfer any documents directly from my PC.  I transferred all my pdf sheet music files directly via USB and can read them folder by folder or document by document with Adobe, Kindle, My Library, or Polaris Office.  The touch screen is responsive to zooming and to quick page turns. The lighting and clarity of text makes reading from music stand distance quite comfortable. I play harp for Hospice at bedsides that are often in a darkened room, and the Infinity allows me to play without lighting and to turn pages without the irritating scratch of sound. Absolutely  perfect sheet music device!\n  Beyond speed, great resolution, fast and accurate touch response, there's all the rest-- WIFI with Internet browsing through Google Chrome or Asus' own, Bluetooth, music and document storage, Kindle, Skype, Youtube, Cloud storage (which I haven't even come close to needing with a whopping 64G internal, 32 GB Sd card, and the possibility of a micro Sd to boot)camera and video, and a multitude of apps--all with plenty of battery life to play. This is one amazing Tablet! The only thing that could be better with the Asus Infinity is the startup time from complete off.\n\n  So why buy the keyboard? Doubles the battery life, makes typing much faster and comfortable, eliminates the need for an additional stand, protects the glass front of the tablet when closed, extra storage with an SD card, can be charged while you are using the tablet, and then gives it's battery life to the tablet when connected.\n  I am so glad I waited the two years until this great tablet hit the market!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I did my research and waited a long time for this tablet.  Overall I consider it the best tablet on the market.  High screen resolution paired with top of the line graphics and processing capability and the best tablet OS family around make this the tablet to beat.  If you're looking for a high end tablet capable of the best games, fast internet cruising, and problem free use then look no further than the Asus TF700.\n\nHardware\nThe build quality is really great, nice metal exterior, scratch resistant glass, buttons have a nice feel.  The tablet feels solidly built, but is surprisingly lightweight and very thin.  The screen resolution is amazing, once you use a tablet with this resolution for a few days going back to the lower resolution of other tablets is hard.  Also the screen is very bright, and very responsive to touch input.\n\nSoftware\nIce Cream Sandwich is a great OS.  Android has consistently improved their OS and this tablet is in line to get upgraded to Jelly Bean sometime soon.  The appearance of the OS is nice and crisp, and with the high resolution screen it really pops.  One issue though regarding software.  Because this is one of only 2 or 3 Android tablets with this high resolution some apps don't take advantage of it.  For example a magazine e-reader I downloaded had a tile only occupying the middle portion of the screen because it was clearly written for the smaller resolution and did not resize on this tablets high resolution.  That being said, most apps and games not only use the entire screen, they also utilize the high pixel count.  You can tell some games are transitioning from low res to high res images in their games (Plants vs Zombies).  Also included on this tablet is a nVidia app called Tegra Zone which acts as a portal to new and upcoming content that utilizes the Tegra 3 chip.  This is a great source for high end games, both FPS and addicting arcade games alike.\n\nKeyboard Dock\nThe optional keyboard available for this tablet is a great accessory.  When on business trips this tablet with attached keyboard replaces my laptop 90% of the time and would replace the other 10% were it not for CAD related work that I sometimes need to do.  It would not replace my laptop though for functions such as email if it did not have the physical keyboard.  Although a little on the small size it clearly mates to the tablet well and has dedicated tablet function keys such as a home key and a back key.  Also unlike generic bluetooth keyboards this keyboard when plugged into the tablet adds ~50% more battery over the tablet alone.  It also adds a full size USB port.  When the keyboard is attached to the tablet the keyboard battery is the main power source, draining it first.  Also if left closed for some time the table will charge from the keyboard.\n\nCovers\nRelated to the tablet is a tablet cover.  I have tried several and the one I like the most for the tablet alone is the \"MoKo(TM) Slim-Fit Folio Cover Case for Asus Eee Transformer Pad Infinity TF700\" which is slim but protects the tablet effectively.  Unfortunately there seems to be only one form factor available for the tablet with the keyboard attached.  I purchased the \"Poetic ASUS Transformer Pad Infinity Case TF700\" and have been fairly disappointed with it.  The cover is thick when used (more than doubling the thickness of the tablet/keyboard) and it can pull the tablet from the keyboard just enough so that it doesn't work.  If you don't mind the extra bulk of this cover then it might be an alright case for you.\n\nElectrical\nOne note is that unlike many other tablets this tablet does not charge with a standard USB cable.  Instead it uses a charging cable with a proprietary plug on one end and a USB 3.0 on the other end.  It will charge with the USB end is plugged into USB 2.0, but it does so slowly and the tablet never acknowledges it's plugged in.  However using a USB 3.0 source works fine.  The tablet and keyboard charge very fast when attached to a USB 3.0 source.  Also you can charge both just by plugging into the keyboard when they are attached.\n\nPackaging\nThe packaging for the tablet was poorly designed.  The first tablet I received had a small dent on the box which I assumed would not impact the tablet.  However upon opening the box I realized this seemingly small dent had damaged the tablet because it has no padding other than the thin cardboard box between the tablet and the outside of the box.  Also the screen is placed very close to the top of the box only protected by a thin layer of foam.  This is only an issue if you receive a damaged one, at which point Amazon will replace it but it can be frustrating when you were eagerly waiting for the tablet to show up.  This seems to be the only major thing I had a problem with that Asus controlled."}

The limitations usually end up being the office software on Android is not up to top-end level. Polaris office which comes preloaded works most of the time, occasionally corrupting files, causing crashes, not as stable as microsoft office (we are talking preloaded tablet software...). other problems with certain webpages do exists, does not always play friendly with youtube website (c'mon android tabs, you should be extremely friendly with your own company's website), facebook website is glitchy to the point of being unusable and the app is almost as bad (my phone a galaxy s2 is better on both the app and the webpage mobile or desktop version...). The tab is snappy, handles pretty much any load thrown at it and with the keyboard dock has battery life that is incredible. the ability to touch a screen on a laptop like device is also amazing, the next step i imagine from here will be the sweet minority report 3d stuff, there is just nothing short of that that will wow me. the 32gb is alright, it would be nice if the tab could recognize the microsd as an option for installing apps and as a default storage place without rooting.\n\nIt works in place of the laptop for most my things, and its limitations are expected for a relatively new OS.

What I'm writing here reflects the opinions of hundreds if not thousands of dedicated ASUS tablet fans who are incensed and disappointed with their latest foray into the tablet market.\n\nIt all started a few months ago: I wanted to make the upgrade from my aging (aging WELL let me remind you) TF101 that I loved so dearly, to its successor, the Transformer Prime. Originally, I ordered it, only to find out literally 4 days later that the Infinity had been released. I issued a return on that unit easily with Amazon, as there was quite a bit of noticable light leak as well as the inherent GPS/Wifi issues. Satisfied, I returned the Prime and waited anxiously for my Infinity to arrive while I hastily (And foolishly) sold my TF101. At this point in my review I'd like to instruct all current owners of the TF101 to HOLD OFF on your upgrade, and don't be so willing to give Asus any more of your money.\n\nI received my first (OF FOUR, so far) Infinity...*sound of crickets* and I was devastated by the lack of quality. Where I had once gotten a perfect Transformer, and convinced MANY of my fellow tech enthusiasts to either purchase one or switch over from the inferior iPads, I was now faced with one severely flawed Infinity. Light leaks all around the bezel, some as large as a half-penny. Creaks along the edges of the frame, thankfully though, no dead pixels. Then I started to USE the tablet, and it all went downhill from there. ANR errors, freezes, performance hiccups...this thing NEEDED root. It's rare that you're able to say of a manufactured device that its Stock experience is literally SO UNSAVORY, that my recommendation to even the most technologically challenged consumer would be to FIND someone to root it for you. And yet, despite the buttery smoothness of the stock kernel on the original Transformer, I found myself unable to deal with the stock experience on the Infinity TWO generations above it. This has been my experience with EVERY REPLACEMENT I'VE RECEIVED to date. Every single one, had light leak issues, and performance bugs (those varied). And only two of them had properly fastened bezels with no give/creaks.\n\nMy OG Transformer had no light leaks, creaks, hiccups or performance issues out the box. I actually wrestled with the decision to root it! Until of course the Prime ROM was released for it (Before ICS, when Honeycomb still held sway on the Android Tabs), and I had to upgrade.\n\nThis Infinity has so much potential, and I think that's the reason I NEED to give it one star. Because NOTHING is as sad, as when a product with the hardware and software capability needed to rival and in some cases DEFEAT anything Apple can throw at it, FAILS to live up to its expectations due to extremely poor QA/QC Departments and TERRIBLE product/kernel architects. How hard is it, really, to tell your manufacturer to REALLY bear down on the assemblers to ensure that EVERY tablet bezel has a uniform fit and finish? How hard is it, to source IPS Panels that don't have such AWFUL amounts of light leak? When you have more than just a few hundred complaints on light-leak for your tablet, that's not a bad BATCH, that's a bad product.\n\nSame goes for the lagging/kernel speed: Am I a disgruntled customer? Yes. But this goes beyond the subjective. Anyone can do a Google search for \"Transformer Prime/Infinity Kernel I/O issues\" and see what I'm talking about. It's THAT simple. Either search will net you hundreds of thousands of results regarding the inferior flash memory that ASUS used on these tabs (to cut costs? on a $500 tablet! Give me the best! I'll pay extra!), and how it affects the I/O Performance in such a way as to make this MORE capable (theoretically) tablet, LESS speedy/capable than its predecessor! One exclamation point at the end of that sentence is not enough to express the outrage and shock I feel due to the lunacy of this entire situation. Really ASUS, How hard is it to fix these problems? Do you have your Devs working on a BETTER kernel for the release of your Jelly Bean blob, to address the I/O issues at the software level, as so many Custom ROM developers have already done for you? I hope so, and I hope that in doing so, you also willingly remove the CMClient software that allows you to remotely access/administer/track your devices and users so clandestinely. Google that also readers, \"CMCLient Tracking\", again, it's THAT simple to dig this stuff up.\n\nThese are such SIMPLE fixes on the side of a multi-BILLION dollar tech company. I still own and continue to use some of their components in my PC's today! And yet, the word from ASUS has been suspiciously mum: not even a simple apology, or would that be too much an admission of guilt? I can't in good conscience continue to give this company my money, if the feedback concerning their poor QC doesn't improve. What we NEED, is for your QC people to get up to snuff (As they did with the original Transformer, I KNOW they can do with this superior product), and make it so that these units are in good enough uniform shape to PHYSICALLY challenge the latest iPad. In addition, we need your Developers to either hand-write enough code themselves to address the shortcomings inherent within the kernel/flash memory, or begin working more closely with developers on XDA who have already made headway on the issue.\n\nEither way, you CANNOT expect to retain the loyalty of your base (Read: Geeks, nerds, PC enthusiasts) if you continue to alienate them with such boneheaded mistakes. This Tablet is a DUD, and though on paper it should by all means be laying waste to the competition, it will never succeed in reality if ASUS continues to give it the half-hearted response to complaints/improvements that they desperately need to address. As a reviewer, consumer, and seasoned IT Professional, I simply cannot give anyone my recommendation to purchase this product until these issues are addressed/resolved. In the event that anything changes, I will update/change my review."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "My first tablet, so far, so good. Have had no physical problems with it but have had some strange software quirks. Don't know if it is just me, the os version, or if it is just typical of the android system or tablets in general. Overall, I am very happy with it but there are two things that bug me. The first is transferring apps to the external micro sd card. I purchased a 32gig micro sd card, inserted into the tablet, the tablet recognizes it, I can move pictures, mp3's, videos to it, so I know I can access it and put things on it, but when I download and install an app that \"moves apps\" to the sd card, it just won't work. There are screen shots that show what should be happening, but the spot that shows \"transfer to sd card\" is not something that my system has. I've tried different \"move to sd card\" apps, all the same problem. I've updated the tablet itself, same problem, bought the actual \"move to sd card\" app hoping that the free ones were crippled but still the same problem. So I don't really know what to do from here. The second problem is when I use the amazon kindle app. I sign onto my amazon account through the app, DOWNLOAD the books and magazines that I've purchased, sign out of my account, go to read my books/magazines, but the kindle app tells me I have to sign onto my amazon account to read them. That is stupid!!!! If I sign onto the app, DOWNLOAD the books/magazines, then sigh out, I should be able to read them whenever and where-ever I want! What if I'm out in the middle of the woods camping with NO INTERNET ACCESS? I thought the reason of DOWNLOADING them was to do just that. That is very frustrating!!!!!!!!!! Not a problem with the tablet though, just the amazon kindle app."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "Personally, I find that tablets are heavily outperformed by similarly priced laptops (PCs of course). However, the performance of this tablet is undeniable.\n\nPros: The 1.6 ghz quad core processor was one of my main motivations for picking this model; all programs run smoothly/no lag, connectivity was another important aspect; multiple sd card ports, a micro hdmi output, usb port are a plus, the screen resolution is amazing especially for a 10 inch screen; everything looks very sharp, the cameras are high quality, and the dock is very useful.\n\nCons: Only 1 gb of ram? (At least its DDR3) Ram is literally cheap these days, as of right now, you can get a 8gb dimm for about 40 bucks. 1 gb is like the absolute minimum you can put in a modern device... The device didn't ship with Adobe Flash, and since it's no longer supported, it took a while to install (yes it's possible).\n\nCompared to the iPad3, it's no contest, the T700's specs outperform with a better processor, faster ram (same amount though), and more connectivity."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I have been waiting for an awesome tablet worthy of purchase for awhile now. The Asus Transformer Infinity T700T is exactly what I was looking for. I considered getting the 64GB model, but ended up getting the 32GB model shipped overnight,  along with four accessories including protection and a 64GB class 10 microSD, for about the price of the 64GB model alone.\n\nI can only give 4 stars however, as the Infinity does seem to have some type of bottleneck or other kink in its internal memory. This is evident by low i/o scores in quadrant, even though the device still ends up with a respectable overall score. Hopefully Asus will be able to address this issue with software and firmware updates, although there is speculation that the hardware used is to blame. Some enthusiasts are exploring utilizing the microSD instead of internal storage, so perhaps even if the hardware is the culprit, a solution may become available.\n\nOtherwise the device is amazing. Web content is very well suited to a 10\" handheld touchscreen; forums, images, videos, shopping, email and more all translate beautifully to the slate. Magazines and books look very nice as well, though I prefer eInk for text only books. The screen is very smooth and responsive.\n\nThe software was not modified heavily by Asus, a few limited additions and tweaks were included, and are easily deactivated if so desired. Things like a customized notification panel and brightness settings fall into this category. The included branded applications are similarly easy to deactivate. These include a file manager (which is awesome, especially for us nerdy types), a notebook that handles writing and drawing (interesting so far, as a digital notebook has been a desire of mine for some time now), a cloud storage system with 8GB from Asus, and of course the gratuitous media and application store, among others.\n\nMany complaints of Android tablets take the form of \"but the applications!\", though a collection of millions of applications does not occur overnight. Android is great in that with some determination and patience, one can make whatever application they desire, no 'Store' required. Those of us who are unwilling or unable to write their own applications need not fear, the more Android tablets are out there, the more developers will release tablet optimized programs.\n\nI did cover the Infinity with a Skinomi clear full body protector as soon as I received it, which disappears nicely over the first few days and seems to be a great anti-scratch layer. I have found myself thinking that the screen protector should have come in matte finish though, as the gloss is wicked with glare reflections. I then put the Infinity in a rooCase multiple position folio case, which is great for preventing larger stresses such as bumps, as well as providing a stand that changes to fit the situation. The Jot Classic stylus does seem to stutter across the Skinomi occasionally thus far. I have considered gluing a small bit of lint-free cloth to the disk on the Jot, though this will negate some of the precision the stylus offers.\n\nThe 64GB class 10 microSD worked immediately. Others have previously reported problems with cards larger than 32GB, though this appears to have been resolved. I believe that it was formatted exFAT upon arrival."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "One of my main reasons for buying this product instead of an IPad was because I use Flash a lot. Imagine my surprise when I found out that this model no longer supports Flash. Too bad.\n\nThen there is the fact that there is no support, information or instructions that I can find anywhere. Certainly not on Asus web site. So if you are not already an expert at operating this type of machine you are basically screwed.\n\nEDIT REVIEW: I am raising this from one to three stars because of the following.\n\nSome nice people wrote to me that Flash is possible - not easy or with very good results - but possible.\n\nAlso, after complaining to ASUS support they actually sent me a User's Manual. I don't know why they hide it so well as it is really quite good. I think if I was selling a product like this I would make sure that the very first thing a buyer got was access to a Manual. But then I gather that customer service is not their strong point.\n\nSo now it is better than a paper weight, but I can't give it over three stars when they make it such an ordeal to get into it - and no reasonable Flash player."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I bought this with high hopes.  Unfortunately I was disappointed.  After extensive research into buying my first tablet, I boiled the competition down to the TF700T and the new iPad.  I chose the TF700T due to several key features: the expandable storage options, dock w/ extra battery and usb, built-in GPS and android OS (I loathe itunes) with Adobe Flash support.  After owning it for a week, I still like the expandability and access to the file system.  However, the other 'pros' have not met my expectations.  First, I found the dock to be not particularly useful.  The keyboard on the dock is too small for me to use practically, and I repeatedly dragged my hand over the touchpad, causing the cursor to jump while typing (ok I'm knit-picking).  With a little practice, perhaps I could learn to use this effectively.  Second, and I may have received a defective unit, but the GPS did not work at all.  I tried to find a signal in multiple locations (indoors and out), at multiple times of day, but never once locked onto a satellite.  When I contacted ASUS support about the GPS, their response was top simply state that the GPS may not work - thanks for nothing, ASUS support.  I knew that GPS was a problem with the transformer prime, but I thought the issue had been ironed out by now.  Regarding the OS, I think the tablet has a great interface and feel. On the app front, I found many of the android apps to be a bit glitchy.  For example, navigation in the netflix app is nearly impossible.  I made a side-by-side comparison of several apps with my brother's ipad2, and in nearly every instance, the ipad2 apps worked better.  For the record, internet browsing was similar between the two devices. Finally, Flash is no longer supported for android, so there goes that advantage over Apple products.\nBottom line: I returned the TF700T and bought a new iPad and have not regretted the decision at all. Please don't disregard this review as just another apple fan bashing android tablets, because that could not be further from the truth.  I had that same mindset when reading reviews before buying this tablet and was dead set on finding an alternative to an ipad. But in the end, considering that their prices are similar, I find the ipad to be a superior device."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "Lucky me! I bought this product and found a hairline crack on it four days after purchase. Didn't drop it, kept it on their dock and literally have no idea how it could have happened unless there was problems with the dock like other users have reported on tranformer forums dot com (would link multiple forums but amazon doesn't allow it). Did some research and read about other's grief with their tablets such as overheating, weak spots on the left corner of the tablet (where mine cracked--so this isn't an isolated incident), and stress put on weak parts of the screen from the rubber rests on the keyboard. And no help from ASUS. This was not a spider web crack, rather a single thin one extending down the entire left side of the screen. And after researching it seems like I'm not the only one dealing with this issue--crack in left corner after docking.\n\nSo closing the unit on the keyboard dock station made to coordinate with the product amounts to \"customer induced damage\". Good to know.\n\nGave ASUS's incredibly unhelpful customer service a call and got a hold of someone who gave canned responses. ASUS decided they would give me the privilege of paying $220 to fix the problem after I paid out of my pocket to send it to them (oh, and they offer no confirmation of receipt--the onus is on you to nag them and check on status). Less than one week after purchase, I'm supposed to shell out more money. Once again, lucky me.\n\nTheir customer service is so bad. Don't believe me, google Asus and customerservice scoreboard (amazon won't allow me to link it here) to see a list of customer complaints with their canned responses, and check the article in Huffington Post by Michael Russnow.\n\nDoes the software on this tablet function? It's fine. But if anything happens and you need service you are up a creek. Buy it with some sort of insurance or with squaretrade, ASUS won't help you if anything goes wrong."}

Now that I've been able to use the tablet for more than a couple of hours I've found that the charging port isn't in a good location on the bottom.

I can take solace in knowing that the tablet worked fine for a little over a year, but that's when the problems started.  Battery life wasn't the issue as it lasted a pretty long time...lag and slow processing was a big deal.  I did a side by side comparison between my Sony Tablet S and IPad 4, and the Asus was by far the slowest piece a crap...but the big thing was the GHOST TOUCH or PHANTOM TOUCH...or whatever you want to call it. It literally felt like someone was continuously tapping on the lower right side of the tablet, so the apps and info screen and whatever else kept popping up automatically. Apparently this is pretty common with Asus tablets...some information that would have been helpful to me prior to buying this!!!  Nonetheless, I still use it to chromecast to my bedroom TV, and I can occasionally use the web browser and some other apps, however, if I could go back in time, I would avoid this tablet completely.\n\nOLD POST\nI've had the TF700 for about a month now.  I originally had the TF300, and decided to upgrade and I'm so glad I did.  Right off the bat, the resolution of the TF700 is superb.  You'll notice it immediately, especially when reading books.  Now that may not matter to some people, but the higher resolution and super IPS feature definitely makes it worth it for me.  Another cool feature is that you can pick the type of performance you want from power save, to balance, to high performance.  Obviously, depending on what you're doing, the mode will affect your battery performance but I haven't had any issues whatsoever.  Apps run smoothly, and there isn't much of bloatware on the device, so I'm kind of confused as to what some posters are saying regarding bloatware.  Bluetooth connection is seamless, and I connect to Wifi almost immediately.  I've used the front and rear facing cameras, and it also has a really cool panoramic setting to take panoramic pictures.  HD video looks great, and I've been able to watch movies from the micro sd card, and transferring files back and forth have been a breeze.  Asus provides there own app store (asus vibe) and some cloud storage, but for now, I'm happy just sticking with the Google Play store.\n\nPros:\nslick overall look with aluminum back\nled flash with front camera\nsturdy build\nsmooth operating system with ICS\neasy connection with bluetooth and wifi\nsd card slot is super convenient\nmicro hdmi allows for connecting to my hd tv to watch netflix and movies\n\nCons:\noccasional freeze with certain apps\nsmall external speaker\nbattery life could be longer, but I've never really tested\nheadphone jack located in a bad spot (lower right)\n\nAll in all, I love this tablet.  I also own the Sony Tablet S which is also a great tablet, but my Infinity is my go to.\n\nI definitley won't be upgrading my tablet any time soon, and the Kindle Fire HD, as appealing as it is, still does not come close to the Infinity in terms of overall build, features, and specs."}

It's now the only computer I use around the house, and I find myself leaving my powerful, but heavy, work laptop at the office.  With the keyboard attached, the tablet becomes a very functional netbook with a full-size USB port as well as a full-size SD card slot.  If you're wanting to pass it around to view a document, use it as an e-reader, or play a game, you can easily snap off the keyboard and you've got a very high end tablet.  The versatility provided by the keyboard attachment really sets this device apart from the field.\n\nPros:\nThe screen is amazing... right up there with the iPad's retina display, but in the widescreen format that I find much more useful since more media fits that size naturally.\nThe keyboard attachment is great.  It provides this tablet with some functionality that you just won't find anywhere else.\nThis tablet performs great (especially since the most recent stability update).  It almost never seems to have any lag (the few issues I did have seem to have been corrected in the most recent update).\n\nCons:\nI've noticed a slightly annoying lag when browsing the web.  It doesn't seem to happen on every website, but it happens enough to be annoying.\nIt's a bit of a stretch to call this a con, but the screen is still a back-lit screen.  It's a very bright one, but if you're looking for something that you can read in full daylight, this still won't do the trick.\nThe price: It's expensive, but when you compare it to similarly spec'd tablets, it's really not terrible.\n\nBottom Line:\nThis is a great tablet with some unique functionality that really sets it apart.  To give you some perspective, my wife is a life-long Apple fan, and after playing with this tablet she wants one of these now.\n\nUpdate:  It's been a few more weeks since I wrote the review, and I thought I'd write a short update.  Asus released the JellyBean update for the tablet about a week ago, and it seems to be running noticeably more smoothly for most things.  My only complaint with the update is that the new Google Now search feature is really slow.  It's actually quite annoying, and I'm going to disable it as a result of that."}

She used it primarily for web apps (email, social networks, surfing) and occasionally documents/spreadsheets. But the hard drive was near empty and it had a paltry 2GB of RAM so she couldn't have too many programs or browser tabs open. The machine was super heavy and bulky to boot. All in all, it was time to let it go.\n\nSo after some thinking, we figured an Asus Transformer Prime with the mobile dock would be the best choice. We decided to abandon traditional laptops with bloated operating systems like Windows or OS X and try a more modern option. I've never been a fan of ultrabooks since I don't believe in paying more than $1000 for any device, especially since you'll have to replace it in a few years.\n\n*Display*\n\nThe Transformer's display is actually not as impressive as I thought it'd be. Sure, it easily matches iPad 3's Retina Display in terms of sharpness. But our Galaxy Nexuses both have similar pixel density, so we don't really notice anything new. And unfortunately, I've gotten used to the inky blacks and gorgeous colors of the AMOLED display on my Nexus. The Transformer's Super LCD looks bland and washed out by comparison. I'm not sure which has more accurate colors (who cares?) but I know that _everything_ looks better on AMOLED. Using an LCD is simply a \"downgrade\".\n\n*Performance*\n\nThe Tegra 3 really flies, especially in games from the TegraZone. I was stunned by the particle effects, shadows, lighting, textures and frame rates in Glow Ball and Dead Trigger. For a mobile device, this is astonishing. However, I was disappointed to see that the device wasn't as powerful as I hoped it'd be. I tried running the Shadow Galaxy live wallpaper and the device couldn't handle it -- scrolling through screens was choppy. By comparison, my Galaxy Nexus and its ancient GPU isn't anywhere as bad. So I'm attributing this lag to the display's 1920 x 1200 pixels -- I guess even the Tegra 3 can't handle that. Still, you don't expect that on a high-end device.\n\n*Build quality*\n\nThe build quality is rock-solid -- it feels like a hunk of metal. But I've always detested the ice-cold feel unfinished look of brushed aluminum, but that's just me. I'd much rather have preferred a unibody polycarbonate design, like in the HTC One X. In addition, it might not seem like it but 1.4 lbs is incredibly heavy to hold. Laptops don't have this problem since they can be nearly 4-5 lbs and still be comfortable for hours. It's annoying always trying to find a more comfortable position to hold the tablet since your hands will tire quickly.\n\n*Keyboard dock*\n\nThe keyboard dock is near perfect. It blows away any other tablet keyboard solution out of the water. Bluetooth keyboards only drain battery and require you to somehow prop up your tablet. Meanwhile, the Transformer's keyboard dock actually boosts your battery life by 50% to a mind-blowing total of 14 hours. It also has dedicated keys to control the OS, which was handy. Unfortunately, the trackpad was tiny and I found that I had to touch the screen more than I wanted to even when using the dock.\n\n*Usability*\n\nThis is where the device crashes and burns. After using the Transformer Infinity, I realized that tablets (Android or iOS) aren't remotely close to being good for doing tasks as well as a traditional computer. Here are some examples.\n\n- Opening a link in a new tab in a browser. This requires you to long-press the link, which sometimes just doesn't register. With the trackpad, it's even more frustrating. On a computer, you simply right-click and choose to open a new tab.\n- Cut, copy, paste. You need to long-press to select the word either by touch or the trackpad, select the Cut/Copy icon, and if you want to paste it in a different app, you have to put up with the hassle mentioned above. Once you're there you have to long-press and select paste. The entire process is a huge step backwards in usability.\n- No browser extensions. Not sure if Chrome Mobile will ever get these, but not having any of my (especially AdBlock Plus) is infuriating.\n- Multi-tasking. Even though Android actually has true multi-tasking, it's not very functional. For example, to chat with a friend requires you to hit the Recent Apps button, find Google Talk and select a person. And then you have to repeat that to return to what you were doing. This is absolutely annoying (and about 1000x more so on iOS) when responding to messages. On a computer, you can multi-task a lot faster and more efficiently.\n- Apps are really diluted, clunky versions of their websites. Trying to edit a spreadsheet on the Google Drive app is a horrible experience compared to the web app. Comparing products in the Amazon app isn't possible since you can only view one at a time. Every app (even on iOS) feels like it was designed to be used in short bursts, instead of sessions. In fact, we stopped using apps on the tablet and just opened the respective site in Chrome.\n\nSummary\n\nThe Transformer is without a doubt a powerful device but it has lots of kinks. What I learned by using this device is that tablets are trying their best to be a legitimate device category but got lost on the way. The Transformer Infinity and iPad are still nothing more than giant smartphones (minus the phone). All the usability problems I mentioned above are invisible and don't bother us when using a phone. Why? Because apps, even those specifically designed for tablets, are best used while on the go in short-bursts. Sure, there are apps for almost everything, but when you have some time and want the full experience, they just don't cut it. And this is because Android and iOS were born in the smartphone world.\n\nIn order to be a justifiable purchase, tablets need to do certain tasks better than any other device. And that task is purely media consumption, at home or on the go. Current examples of tablets that have found their identity are the Nook, Kindle Fire or the Nexus 7, which are designed from the ground-up to be gateways to their respective app stores. They're better for reading books/magazines, watching movies/TV shows, and playing games than any other device. The 7\" form factor is ideal since it's not bulky or as heavy. No surprise that Apple is frantically entering this category soon.\n\nSo yes, we returned the Transformer Infinity after using it for a week. During that time, my wife was sick of using it and couldn't get enough of my Chromebook. Since using web apps and browsing is what she does most, the Chromebook was a perfect fit. And there simply isn't a better device for that. But that's another story ([...])"}

Beautiful high res screen and Super IPS capability definitely won't disappoint.\n2. Hardware.  Tegra 3, etc . . . should yield nice performance for non stock Android builds\n3. Expandability- external SD card capability is great\n4. Build quality-Generally good materials and finish.\n\nCons:\n1. Out of the box speed and stability.  The unit is quite laggy right our of the box especially for web browsing.  Also the device often faults out and programs freeze, reset, etc . . .\n\n2. Bloatware-device slows down significantly with lots of junk programs running constantly like PixWe.  Isn't bloatware a windows thing??\n[...]\n\n3. NO Jelly bean as of 9/16/2012.  Only way to get JB is to load CyanogenMod 10.\n\n4. Privacy and Security Concerns.  Turns out that ASUS wants to know what you are doing with your device.  So they put in a backdoor for themselves,CMClient.  They can use this monitor whether or not you unlocked or rooted your device.  Also apparently can do lots of other nasty things\n\n\"Disable remote management that allows ASUS (or anybody in charge of their servers) to track, lock or wipe your device over-the-air or steal your data, which has been confirmed ASUS is doing: read the whole story about warranty voided because of rooting here.\"\n[...]\n\n5. Needs Volume+ app for proper sound.  Why?\n\nBottomline:\nAll in all the Infinity has lots of promise if you are willing to roll up your sleeves and add a custom ROM or disable lots of bloatware.  However the stock experience is slow, laggy, and unstable.  That might change with an over the air update from ASUS but the privacy concerns won't.  For as much as this tablet costs it should be amazing out of the box.  I don't mind rooting my device and customizing but I don't like HAVING to do that just so it works.\n\nSadly ended up returning the device."}

However Amazon.com is next day airing me a replacement. Amazon.com rocks. Thanks.\n\nUpdate: The replacement TF700 works awesome. It's fast, clear, easy to use. This is much better than the Nexus 7 but it also cost a lot more than the Nexus 7. I purchased this to run the Square credit card app and it does but the card reader doesn't work with it. I have to hand type the card number into the tablet which cost more to run. This is not up to Asus to fix but it would be nice for them to look into it. The TF700 meets all the spec requirements. The only thing I can see to be improved after only a few days of use is a micro usb charging port. I'm sure Asus has their reasons for using a proprietary charging port. I'm also looking forward to the Jelly Bean update when it arrives.\n\nUpdate 10-12-12: I charged my tablet all night and turned it on at 7am and put it is \"sleep\" and it was dead (won't turn on) at 11am.

I chose the Anus TF700T because of its features as compared to other tablets - one main feature being the option to expand its storage with the use of a microSD card and the HD screen.\n\nDo not count on your 64GB Micro SD card being able to mount and work with the Anus TF700T. Don't even count on your 32GB microSD even working! Sure, one could goto the XDA forums and look through the list of known microSD cards that do work this this table, but I say don't waste your money as of yet. Bought this tablet specifically for the ability to use a 64GB Micro SD Card and here I sit on my hands.\n\nFor such a claimed power full tablet, it sure is laggy across the board just changing from home screen to home screen - probably because of the great HD screen.\n\nNever in my time have I had a browser crash so many times and completely reset its self. The external speaker on the Anus TF700T is one of the worst I have ever had the displeasure of hearing - and requires an additional app (volume+) just to get it to a comfortable volume level.\nWhile I did not have any production problems with this tablet (screen, buttons, etc..) many others have had. Asus is not known for their quality control.\n\nReally wish that I had come across a post like this before I bought this tablet. Android is great, just don't let this be your first whack at an Android tablet.\n\nDON'T BE A PAYING BETA TESTER FOR ANUS LIKE I AM AND MANY OTHERS!\n\nUpdate : 9/18/2012\n\nWith the recent OTA update, many users are reporting that their microSD cards are now working. Sadly, I am not one of those people.  Here is the actual reply from Asus customer service regarding the microSD card issue.\n\n\"Dear valued customer\nThank you for contacting ASUS Technical Service\n\nHi. We support SDHC for 32g,only A66 for SDHC 64G,and all of the products doesn't support SDXC.\n\nWelcome to refer Troubleshooting & FAQ for ASUS products in ASUS\nwebsite:\n[...]\nIf you have any problems, please do not hesitate to contact us.\nWish you a nice day!\"\n\nI guess there you have it. Product does not support SDXC microSD cards - unbelievable. So the flagship Android \"HD\" tablet does not support the most capable SDXC cards... My Galaxy S3 supports SDXC cards just fine without issue!!!\n\nAlso wanted to talk about the GPS on this tablet. While it does lock fairly fast (less than 10 seconds), it still remains a horrible mess. With all the location aiding services turned on, my position is yet to be correct.  Once locked on, my position bounces around from house to house to house in my neighbor hood never settling. Once again, my Galaxy S3's GPS locks within seconds, gives a pin point accurate location and even follows me around correctly while inside of my home.\n\nGuess it is too much to ask for the same working functions of my phone in a tablet thats tripple the physical size....."}

One thing that I saw that was helpful was that it can switch from one Internet source to another without having to set it.  It does it for you if the Internet source is known already.  The tablet is quick and responsive to the touch.  It is light and slender enough to hold for long periods.  My suggestion for users is not to get this item confused with it being an ultrabook or laptop.  The keyboard does help with the battery life too, allowing the unit to last over 10 hours on a single charge.  The USB and SD ports on the keyboard provides more storage space if needed.  The operating system is very helpful but I only wished that Asus would have worked on the keyboard a bit more.  The keyboard is NOT for papers or long document creations. I bought this item to act as a replacement for doing work online but as I said, the keyboard is cramped and creates more typos.  Deciding on getting the keyboard is a toss up. It gives you more battery life and ports needed to provide more storage space, but doesn't give you much typing space leaving your hands cramped up.  The touchpad is slightly helpful but not very.  I normally turn it off because it does interfere with typing, moving the cursor around.  I'm glad Asus saw this as a problem because they also designed a button to turn the touchpad off, if needed.  It is a good product with a few quirks on the keyboard but the tablet, itself, is sound."}

The biggest downside is something that most have already mentioned. The app department is still lacking.

It was a great but had one minor white spot (which I initially thought was a speckle of dust) which happened to be a LCD leak/cloud/pixel dust/whatever people call it. I noticed it only after a couple of hours. It was really minute, very difficult to make out, as it is noticeable only when looking straight right above it, only on a complete white background. It almost got blended with the white background at certain brightness levels. Well, I'm very particular about my screens. I applied for replacement in the night and by the amazing super-fast service of both Amazon and Asus, I got my replacement next day! Really happy with the service.

Fantastic performance - The four cores fired up and Nvidia tegra 3 kicked into play when in turned on Horn - butter smooth gameplay, great textures, rich world detail, smooth edges. can run songs on youtube/ music from library while surfing on net, or even minimizing that to change screen to supernate/polaris for taking notes. No slowdowns noticed.\n\n2. Brilliant screen: Anyways the human eye cannot process iPad's resolution n ppi - screen would need to be 40inch+, neither can it process the infinity's reso and ppi on a 10.1\" screen. Great clarity and color contrast. IPS + ROCKS!\n\n3. Camera - The 8mp on the back with flash, surpasses my expectations! though the front camera is really important for me as I would rarely/never use a back cam on a tab. The front cam amazed me to with pretty decent clarity - it being 2mp. Works great for Skyping!\n\n4. Body and design - Haha! I fell in love with it when I saw it online for the first time. Great design, very thin and light, sturdy, well-built, elegant... all 9 yards...\n\n5. Battery backup (without dock) - After charging it to full, I used it with heavy applications running simultaneously on full performance n IPS+mode for 2 hrs, and heavy gaming (Horn, Batman, Nova 3) for 2hrs - I still had 22% battery left. Its good enough for me.\n\nI also bought the dock. You can find my review on the item page."}

Gmail app crashes, apps are unresponsive for periods of time and simple operations sometimes feel laggy.  Even with the settings turned to performance mode, if you start rattling through different apps, I am sure the laggy/choppiness can be recreated.  My only hope is that the butter smoothness of Jelly Bean addresses the OS issues.  I am hesitant to tell someone to wait for Jelly Bean before purchasing but... wait for Jelly Bean before purchasing.  Especially if you are used to a smoother experience, found on the GS3 or iPad."}

I don't live in USA but I though: since it's cheaper in Amazon, and I'm staying for a couple of days with some folks, why not get it there? Now I'm a great amount of miles from there, stuck with a tablet that can't run the simplest of games without freezing and flicking like hell. It's been four days since I bought it, and I've already had to restart it 5 times!! What am I supposed to do? (besides never buying anything else from Asus).

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "Yes, I've never had a smart phone or tablet or anything other than a Macbook laptop, so this is my first smart device.  I received it as a bonus at work; I would never spend this much $ on a non-computer device.  I work in the computer industry, I'm a luddite and I like command line tools.  No terminal with ssh and I'm lost.  I don't have a smart phone because I don't see how anyone can read text that small.  I have to admit, though, I'm liking this tablet.  Co-workers have helped me figure out how the UI works.  I have only downloaded a few apps (mostly games).\n\nThe screen is very bright and crisp!  The colors are great!  Looking at photos on picasa is a pleasure because of the rich colors.  The sound comes out of the small screen area on the underside of the table.  Volume is OK, but don't expect Bose quality sound.  The UI is pretty snappy; when you scroll back and forth the hardware responds with just a very brief lag.  It's plenty fast by my standards.  Be aware that the screen is a fingerprint magnet.  The smudges are only noticeable when the screen is black.  There is nothing about the Android OS or UI that irritates me, and I'm picky.  I really like the feature where you give a fast swipe and the screen keeps scrolling; just like if you were pushing a ball along the floor, it keeps going!  Very nice UI feature.\n\nI am not pleased, however, that almost every app I download wants access to a lot of information.  I'm hoping that over time this will change and the OS will prevent apps from accessing information.  No problem, though, I just create another dummy account that I don't use.\n\nI received the matching dock.  I provides additional battery life, but it seems to have issues.  I'm not sure if the dock is defective or if I don't know how to use it in concert with the tablet.\n\nOverall, I find the hardware and Android OS to be really fast on this device.  It has only crashed once in almost a month of ownership.  If you want to spend the money on a 10 inch tablet, this is pretty nice.  Since I have never used any other tablet devices to compare against, I don't feel qualified to give 5 stars.  It earns a score of 4 stars because of the great screen, fast hardware and overall positive experience using the tablet."}

The ASUS software that comes load is horrible and does not work as advertised.  The drop box takes forever to sync.  Saving items to the file plan is more painfull then having teeth pulled.  I did tech support on line and they could not help.  You cant delete any files that come pre-loaded - DUMB.  If you unlock it, voiding the warrenty you can, and ASUS will help by giving you the software - SUSPICOUS!  We tried desperately to use the tablet for two weeks.  Not worth it.  It is very sensative to WiFi, and constantly lost connection in my house (even though my crappier Windows Phone keeps connection everywhere in my house.  I also tested the signal strength in the house, bought a bigger WiFi antenna, and switched channels, NO LUCK.  It is also very hard to set the settings.  It burns through the battery in about 6 hours without doing anything intense (IHeart radio).  I could never get videos to play. I also could never find the video player software on the tablet.  I bought this because i don't like how Apple locks you into their crap only, well it looks like i will have to finally break down and get an apple product.  I don't know if Jelly Bean will help but i am not waiting around to find out.  The tech people could not even tell me when or if jelly bean was even coming.  Also NO FLASH capability.  It is not compatible.  So half the websites don't work.  Who builds a tablet without FLASH support.\n\nUpdate 30 Sept:  My friend at work did not listen to me and bought an Infinity anyways.  Same exact problems to a T.  WiFi does not connect, scrolling is slow, system becomes overwehlmed when you try to do two tasks at once. Also his USB port does not read external storage devices.  His also has problems playing videos.  It will play the first four or five minutes of most vidoes and then stop.  The other videos, the tablet won't even play."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I felt obligated to write a review after reading so many other ones and having for the tablet for a week.\n\n1st off before you purchase this tablet you have to consider the following: Android and iOS are two very different operating systems and are suited for different target markets... I can't stand when people compare Android to iOS because imo they are to very different operating systems (Similar to how people compare macs to pcs). I would say that I have a high level of technical experience (8-10) so my view point is not one of a casual user, after spending a week with this product I can say I'm very impressed with it and consider it the best tablet on the market (for my needs).\n\nIf you do your research you will notice that unfortunately the TF700 has some CQ issues so it's important to buy form a reputable retailer in case you have to return or exchange the tablet.\n\nPeople have complained about slow down or performance issues and while I do not doubt them I myself have not had any...I've rooted it, installed apps, played emulators, watched 1080p videos, used gps, bluetooh and have not had any performance issues again this is just my experience. If you do in fact notice performance issues I would exchange it (there's no explanation why some users reviews say it runs perfect and some say it slows down)\n\nPros:\n\n* Screen: the screen is very nice, it's sharp, clear and bright...Yes the iPad screen is a bit sharper or clearer but unless you hold them side by side I don't think your going to notice a difference. The TF700 screen is brighter and has an outdoor mode, which depending on how much you use it outdoors maybe an important factor.\n\n*Memory: This was a major priority for my in choosing this tablet over lets say the Nexus 7 or iPad, being that an entry level iPad had 16gb and costs the same I knew that 16 gbs wasn't going to be enough, the TF700 comes with 32 gbs as well as allows use of up to a 64 gb MicroSD card which you can find around $50-$60. You can also get the dock (which I highly recommend) which allows you to add another $64 gb full sd card or connect a usb flash drive or external hard drive. All in all lack of memory or not enough space will not be an issue with the TF700.\n\n*Battery Life: I get around 6-7 hrs of battery life with normal usage, browsing the web, playing apps ect overall its what I expect just realize that it's going to be shorter depending on what you do. A major battery drain is browsing the web and I've read that users get around 5 hrs of battery life w/ only web browsing. Note if you add the keyboard dock it will roughly add another 4 hrs of battery life to your tablet.\n\n*Keyboard Dock: This was another determining factor for me was the keyboard dock, I originally wanted a laptop with a nice screen and excellent battery life (7-8 hrs) and that I could use for typing notes at school...when I saw the TF700 thought it fit my needs well in terms of screen and battery life but a major draw back was not having MS Office...Well good news because MS Office will be released for iOS and Android by the end of the yr (reports are saying Nov), after reading that I had no reservations.\n\nConnectivity: The mini HDMI port was also another big plus in my book, adding a lot of media on my tablet it's nice to be able to watch movies or tv shows you have on your tablet your TV. It's also really nice to be able hook it up to the tv to play games or emulators (PS3 and Xbox controllers work w/android). It also has a optional usb port on either the keyboard dock or adapter, the usb can read drives, game controllers (xbox, ps3 and wii classic) as well as power portable hard drives.\n\nCons:\n\n*Performace / QC issues: While I have not had any issues, reading reviews and going on XDA I know that many others have, some have exchanged it multiple times in order to get a perfect tablet and while it's not an issue for me to do this it may be for some. Overall just make sure you purchase it form a reputable easy to work with retailer (also make sure you call and ask if it is indeed defective if you pay the out of pocket return shipping costs or if they send you a prepaid label).\n\n*Support: Right now there just isn't very much tablet app support for Android, while that is slowly changing if you plan on purchasing this just for apps then I would recommend the iPad over this easily.\n\n*Connector: Asus uses their own connector similar to apple, while I understand the need for it when attaching the keyboard dock I wish they could have included a micro usb port somewhere as the majority of devices use it.\n\nOverall this is an amazing tablet... I consider it very similar to a laptop with the flexibility of Android and MS Office being released on a mobile platform. I would highly recommend this for someone who is looking wants something different but has similar functionality to a laptop or already has one (cough me cough). As far as performance issues go Jellybean should be released very soon hopefully within the next few weeks and that should greatly improve the user experience and fix many of the performance issues and while there's no way to tell until its released Jellybean's main focus is fix many of the UI issues that have been plaguing Android tablets so no matter what it should help quite a bit.\n\nVS the iPad: As much as I don't like comparisons it's going to happen the main differences between the two products is the OS...it's really important to determine which OS suites you better:\n\nAndroid: Android will require a learning curve and for you to play around, and set up your OS to suite your personal needs. It gives you freedom to do pretty much whatever you want with the OS and lets you customize like crazy. But once again there is a learning curve I've been using Android for about 2 yrs and its taken me a lof of time and research to learn and utilize the OS even now I'm still learning how to do stuff XDA and youtube are great resources, but once again I'm the type of person that loves doing research and customizing and fidgeting with my toys so it really depends on the type of person you are.\n\niOS (Apple): The biggest draw to iOS is the simplicity of the operating system and it's app support. The iPad is something that anyone can pick up and use (including my 5 yr old nephew). If you want something where you don't really have to mess around with too much and just want to play with apps then I would hands down recommend the iPad over the TF700.\n\nHopefully that helps a little! Sorry if I got off topic but I got really tired of reviews complaining that it's too big (uhh why did you buy a 10\" tablet in the 1st place) or other issues. That would be like someone complaining that the iPad doesn't have enough memory....Also make sure you check you mobiletechreview they do a great comparison and have really great and useful videos."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "Or should I say watch out Asus? This is the first (and so far only) Android tablet to be just as good as (in my opinion better) than the iPad as far as specs are concerned. That said, do we now expect Apple to sue Asus for making a perfect tablet? *ba-da-TCH!*\n\nAlright, before I begin my review I want to point out that if you want the champagne color, there IS a way to get it. As Amazon is - at the time of me writing this review - only \"pre-selling\" the 64 GB version of the Champagne version, you CAN find it for sale from BestBuy.com. DO NOT GO TO THE BEST BUY STORE SEEKING THE CHAMPAGNE COLORED TABLET. You will only be met with disappointment, as I was told by a sales rep that the stores only carry the gray color. Now then, moving along.\n\nThe tablet is fantastic. I am a junior college student with a weakness for technology and video games. First off, the battery life is amazing. I bought it with the keyboard dock, but I only use it for taking notes in class. Otherwise, I just use the tablet as what it is: a tablet. I play Grand Theft Auto III and Mass Effect Infiltrator on this beast and it can handle it all at max graphics settings. Other people have noted how wonderful the screen looks and yes, it is truly HD. Even with full brightness and graphics cranked up playing a high-end android game, the battery has held up for two hours of constant use, and had about half battery left.\n\nI love using it to watch Hulu and Netflix. The video just pops on the HD screen and it is a truly wonderful experience.\n\nThe screen itself is built in such a way that the tablet is not rendered useless outside. I'm not sure how Asus did it, but they have managed to defeat the sun. Normally, as most of you probably know, using a laptop or a tablet outside is next to impossible. The glare from the sun makes it so that you have to strain your eyes to even make out large text.\n\nThis is not true for the Infinity.\n\nI was outside today in the middle of a bright August day on campus reading an eBook with no problem at all. There was no eye strain, no squinting, nothing. Just turn the IPS up a bit, and you're good to go! I read a full chapter of fiction before class with no problems from eye strain.\n\nEvery Android tablet I've seen can run flash, yet this one is the first one I've seen that can truly run it as smoothly as your PC or laptop can. There is none of the jittery, bumpy lag during flash animations. They play out smoothly and naturally on this tablet.\n\nDurability:\n\nI'm sad to say that I have performed a unintentional drop test on my Asus. I was walking down the sidewalk reading a book on my way to class and was bumped into by a careless student on a skateboard (in college? Really?). Much to my dismay, my slim Infinity fell in slow motion to the concrete down below, landing face down.\n\nI scooped up my precious, which I had only had for less than a day at the time, fully expecting I would have to send it in to Asus for repairs and discovered that, remarkably, the screen was unharmed. There were no scratches, no cracks, nothing! Just a bit of dust! I wiped it off and it was as good as new! Well, with the exception of a minor ding on the corner of the metal, but everything still appeared to be in working order. Headphone jack still worked and played wonderfully, machine still as snappy and responsive as ever. Whew!\n\nTruly, the tablet is everything I could want and more. It's got style, durability, and portability. My only complaint, and it is a minor one, is that there is no stereo audio. There is only one speaker on the device and, while the sound is very clear and high quality, with only one speaker on the side it feels a bit.. off to my ears.\n\nBut this is only a minor problem for me as I usually have a pair of headphones on me at all times anyway. But for some people it may be a larger concern.\n\nAll in all, a great product with great engineering that I'm sure will last me for years to come. If you're looking for a solid, well-built tablet to finally stick it to those snooty iPad owners, this is the one for you!\n\n----EDIT----\n\nI took a bit more time and compared the New iPad to the specs of the Infinity, in case anyone was considering buying one or the other. So, how does the Infinity compare to the iPad? I took the specs directly from Amazon. As I do not personally own an iPad, I cannot test the Infinity against it for things such as battery life and other hands-on trials. But there are still some other technical details that need to be considered to make the smartest purchase...\n\nScreen:\n\nThe Apple iPad has a screen size of 9.7 inches, versus the Infinity's screen size of 10.1. I personally prefer the larger tablets. I mean, if you're going to get a large tablet, bigger is better, right? Otherwise there are smaller, 7 inch tablets. The iPad does beat the Asus here in terms of screen resolution (The iPad's res is a whopping 2048 x 1536 versus the Infinity's 2048 x 1536), however I have compared my Infinity to my friend's new iPad, both of us watching Transformers. There is a difference yes, and the iPad does appear slightly more crisp. However, I did not test the iPad for outdoors entertainment so I cannot say how well it handles under the sun.\n\nProcessor:\n\niPad: 1 GHz\nInfinity: 1.6 GHz\n\nThat's a huge difference there. That means for more multi tasking and a faster device overall. Both devices run on quad core.\n\nRAM:\n\niPad: 1 GB DDR2\nInfinity: 1 GB DDR3\n\nThe Infinity is using a newer, more powerful DDR chip.\n\nHard Drive:\n\nWhile the iPad is available in a number of sizes, the 16 GB size is already over $500, compared to the Infinity's 32 GB size being right at $500 (slightly cheaper on Amazon). So, you are basically getting twice as much memory for cheaper. Of course, the Infinity is available in a 64 GB size for $100 more to match the larger iPad sizes that run well above $700.\n\nItem size:\n\nThis is not largely significant, as the iPad weights in at 1.4 pounds and the Infinity beats it at a whopping 1.3. Still, if we are getting into the nitty and gritty, the Infinity is still lighter and slimmer. The iPad used to love to brag about being the slimmest tablet. No longer can that be said. The iPad has a width of .37 inches, while the Infinity has a width of .33. Again, this is not significant and will likely not impact anyone's buying decision, but it's a fun fact!\n\nRear Webcam Resolution:\n\niPad: 5 MP\nInfinity: 8 MP\n\nThis is no contest. 3 megapixels is a significant change in picture quality. While I don't suspect anyone is going to replace their digital camera with their tablet any time soon, the Infinity has nevertheless beat the iPad once again.\n\nSo there you have it. That is the specs as I see and understand them. Feel free to contradict me. I'm not pretending to be a computer engineer. I'm just a nerd. But from where I'm standing, as far as the specs are concerned, while the iPad does have a higher resolution screen, it would not be able to out perform an Infinity in terms of processing power, memory, and price.\n\nAnd of course the Infinity has something the iPad could never have: PORTS. Let's not forget the mini USB and mini HDMI ports that they have managed to squeeze on this ultra-slim device. But wait, where is Apple's on their beloved iPad? That's right. They don't have them, because they don't want anyone else gaining access to THEIR device.\n\nAnd just because I have to: Apple is seriously still not providing Flash support on their devices? Get with the times, Apple. Flash is no longer a problem on tablets."}

As a frequent flying professional, I need small thin light computing which does NOT break my neck lugging through the airport, and fits on a tray.\n3) Heard about Ubuntu for Android, which requires a quad core (Tegra) to run. I use Linux for work because I'm a scientist and, well, frankly it is better is so many thousands of ways.

It looks great on this little machine. It is very fluid, and on this computer I have had few hangups which others speak of. No application freezes really, although there are a few apps which will not quit. The tablet experience, at least as a 10 in tablet, is NOT for me. I have no patience with the ridicuouls on screen keyboards. Surprisingly, on a smaller screen, using my thumbs, I have NO problems. But on this huge on screen keyboard, no, too clumsy. I have used the device almost solely as a netbook. For a tablet, the Kindle is the right size for me. The surprising LACK of one of integration of one of Google's key features, Google Voice, is more irritating than I can express. Google Talk is there, why doesn't it handle Google Voice calls? Google phone number, Google OS, Google browser, why do I need a third party software like GrooveIP or somesuch to make a dang call (which would, on a computer, be implemented through a browser plug-in)?! No streaming radio service built in? Macs have it, even Symbian has it. Google? Just too many third party software to set up to do basic things I pretty much expect from other OS's. As a heavy user of keyboard shortcuts and hotkeys on the various desktop OS's (Mac, MSW, Linuxes) I find the use of the keyboard crippled. Typing is not the same as on a laptop. Sometimes unexpected things happen like when I backspace and it goes to the top of the third paragraph ABOVE where I am typing. Weird.\n\nVerdict:\nThough it came with Ice Cream Sandwich, I love Android. It has its shortcomings, but, overall, I like it. The learning curve and setting thigns up is tiresome, but, it is just a learning curve so I can handle that. However, I am too frustrated with the unreliable keyboard, frustrating trackpad, and sometimes unresponsive screen. The Infinity is going back tomorrow. Perhaps I'll get a smaller Android tablet like the Google 7. Or wait for a system I'm more familiar with like the Linux Vivaldi tablet. Or an ultrabook. But not a tablet kludged into being a netbook. Great idea, good college try, but for me, nah. Not sure if I'll ever convert to the tablet religion.\n\n-* Details *-\n\nGood:\n1) Android!\n2) luscious screen, very bright\n3) Nice sleek form factor, solid build\n4) Google Drive kicks A\n6) \"function\" keys, and home row keys are simplistically designed and intuitively understood. This concept is like a perfected page from Apple's own design book, which it did not itself perfect. I love the function keys on this thing.\n7) Notifications are great. Love them.\n8) incredible battery life\n9) File manager. I guess Android does not normally come with a File manager, but, the Infinity does, and it feels like various Linux file managers, ie, for the most part I like it (and it looks fairly nice too).\n\nBad:\n1) Comes with Ice Cream Sandwich, not with Jellly Bean.\n2) No flash. Ie - no Amazon video, very little youtube, loading even Google pages is difficult since they use flash heavily. Poor corporate decisions.\n3) Lots of configuring to do\n4) No built in phone solution\n5) no Chrome apps/extensions (like Google Voice etc)\n6) lack of keyboard shortcuts\n7) whole thing is too big as a tablet, unweildy, and hard to interact with, but as a laptop/netbook it is too small\n8) keyboard is sometimes laggy, or doesn't input\n9) sometimes tablet and dock do not, well, dock\n10) trackpad is sooooo irritating. seriously, I thought trackpad issues came from the hideous driver implementation MSW (terrible trackpad on MSW? install Linux and turn the trackpad into a Mac quality trackpad, so strange). This little bugger enjoys not working as a trackpad.\n11) oh and sometimes the screen itself doesn't like touch inputs to browsing. Fail.\n12) No terminal. And there's no Google terminal. I am a little too security conscious to install a nonstandard terminal which I am unfamiliar with.\n\nNotes:\n\nEssential changes for my ATI:\n1} Chrome for Android / History\nSome comment about not being able to view Chrome for Android's history. Here's how:\nchrome://history\nI bookmarked it.\n\n2) Chrome for Android / erase History\nI went to Settings > Advanced > Privacy.\nI could not find an option among the group for delete history. In regular Chrome, and Android Browser, this is where you find this item.\nI did a search for the information on the internet.\nJeje it was right there all along. For some reason it is up in the top right of the window bar.\n\nUpdate 2012-0910:\n\nThe Worst part of the whole thing is that I keep getting Hostile Comments from (obviously) Asus Employees; who would waste time writing negative responses to a user review? This goes to show what type of experience they will afford purchasers of their kludgy (though pretty) Android transformer. Unfortunately, customer service is obviously dead. Because of the obvious offensive position the Asus employees it's great to me that I returned the frustrating tablet as it saves having to deal with their attitude when an actual problem arises. It has been a month since I purchased/returned the Infinity and now, with MSW8 coming out, a new Kindle beast, and cheaper options like the Google Nexus tablet, I cannot see a positive to this device other than its looks."}

The materials are really nice (Metals > Plastics) but the loose touchscreen issue is very apparent.  The first unit made clicking sounds when you press softly on the left side of the touchscreen where it's slightly lifted up, very annoying.  So I requested an exchange with Amazon, got the new 2nd unit and looked it over.  Immediately noticed three small dents on the back metal housing.  This unit screen also have excessive and annoying light bleed that the 1st Infinity didn't have.  The touchscreen is loose in one corner but didn't make clicking noises.  My brother in law bought one couple of days ago and right out of the box the metal backing has a scratch and the screen is loose and clicked in two places when pressed.  I am very disappointed in your quality control Asus.  I really want this tablet as it's the best in specs at the moment but for what I paid I want a quality tablet.  What I and my brother in law got are tablets put together carelessly.  Please fix your QC as it put a very bad taste in my mouth.  Doing a google search for the loose screen issue comes up with many others having the same issue.  I have used and loved Asus products over the years (videocards, motherboards, etc) but just comes to show QC isn't important anymore.  I've returned both Infinities I got and my brother in law returned his as well."}

All the hardware works including wifi, gps, cameras, microphone and speaker. The tablet never overheats. The TF700T froze once needing a reboot (using a paper clip). Some apps are not compatible at this time. Specifically Words with Friends, Draw Something and the Onstar app. My wife has an iPad3 and we compared videos. Both looked equivalent and excellent. The Tegra processor is ok, but don't expect desktop or even laptop speeds. However, the speed is roughly equivalent to the iPad3 and the Kindle Fire. Sometimes it helps the speed to close open apps. The battery lasts all day.\n\nPros:\nBeautiful screen\nNice size and shape\nMicro SD slot\nNice pictures and video\nGPS works great\n\nCons:\nIt froze once requiring a reboot\nSome speed deficiencies (normal with tablets?)"}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I really like this tablet besides the defects on mine (I have a new one coming today Aug 25th)my TF700T had very bad light bleed, the WiFi decided the other day to non stop connect and then abruptly reconnect right after it connects and repeats indefinitely, so it was IMKPOSSIBLE to use, not even a factory reset twice fixed it or the .26 firmware update (my tablet also REFUSED to find any OTA so I had to download the firmware from the asus support site and install it via SD card)my tablet also suffered badly from the screen bulge on the lower left hand side, and clicked when ever touched on the lower right hand side. The TF700T's headphone jack is in the worst possible place on the tablet it's right where you hold it on the left hand lower side so its very annoying if you are using it with headphones plugged in there. Over all the Tablet was very fast and should be all the better with Android 4.1 JellyBean, very thin and the screen was AMAZING I just hope my new one will be even more amazing if it does not have bad light bleed. I exchanged mine on amazon and they sent it to me 1-day shipping they really have the best customer service! Also if you are sick of not having high quality wallpapers for such a fantastic screen then download 'Simple Image Wallpaper Free\" from the Google Play Store and then either search google for 1920X1200 wallpapers or interface lift etc etc download the wallpaper and then go into your live wallpapers and select simple image and find the image to set the WHOLE HIGH RESOLUTION image as your wallpaper, no stupid cropping. it's sharp and really shows off your screen no more crappy low res wallpapers anymore!!! :)\n\nUPDATE Aug 26th\n\nThe new unit is superb. No WiFi issues, the Bezel appears to be sturdy and no bulge on the lower left hand corner, Light bleed is very little and acceptable on this unit. this unit deserves 4 stars but im leaving it overall at 3 because Asus should have much better QC than they do!"}

The real point I want to make here is I got the tablet here on Amazon. Getting great service with fast shipping. The dock is what you need be careful buying. This takes a TF201 dock. Even if you buy a dock saying it is a TF700 dock for $159.00..It is not. Its a Tf201.. Even says TF201 on the box along with saying for TF700. Point being you can buy the TF201 for $99.00 or less and it works great on the Asus 700. It even auto locks. I got my dock at Office Depot for $79.00. Office Depot tried to sell me the Tf700 dock for $159.00 until I showed them on there boxes it is the same dock. The dock is also outstanding and gives you a mini laptop with everything you need for work and play. The tablet  can out do any IPAD and with the dock you have better then a Macbook Air at about half the cost. I know the Mac Heads will disagree but that is why they are Mac Heads. So buy the Tablet here on Amazon then go to a local store and get your dock. If I have confused you just remember buy the TF201 dock!!!!! Save your money. Asus has enough money most of us do not..."}

I play on it all of the time - email, facebook, Internet searches are easy as pie. I read books and magazines on it too - also nice! I am very happy that I have my little Asus.

This is our first tablet device and we are quite impressed with it. We considered an iPad, but dislike being tied to Apple/iTunes as well as their monopoly based prices. Android is much more of an open system, connect to the PC via USB and it is treated as another drive by a file manager, making data transfers very easy.\n\nScreen resolution is great, viewing high res video looks very good as does viewing pictures. The sound reproduction isn't great, but what can you expect from a small internal speaker?\n\nInitial setup and use is quite easy and intuitive, I hardly needed to refer to the manual for the basics.\n\nBottom line, I recommend this over iPad, probably much better than many other Android tablets."}

The touch screen is unresponsive and very lagging.  The software is very buggy.  The main problem is that it constantly freezes after it goes into power save mode.  If using the power button to wake it up it constantly fails to wake requiring a hard reset. Also, it has trouble with simple apps.  Its always shutting down apps.  The volume and sound is crappy too. And the cursor is jumpy. So i call asus and cannot get support until i charge the battery.  So for $$600 i have a tablet that half works.  Which defeats the purpose of having  a toy.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "This is my first android based device, and after owning an iPhone for 4 years now, I gotta say, I really am glad I went with this android based tablet instead of the iPad. Don't get me wrong. I love apple products and own a MacPro, Macbook, iPhone 4S, iPhone 3GS, Airport Extreme, Airport Express, Keyboard and Magic Mouse. But it is nice to get away from the iOS. Though unflawed, it has become a bit boring. I couldn't imagine just having a larger iPhone to play on after playing on my iPhone all day....na mean?\n\nThe battery life is AMAZING!\n\nI charged it for the first time on a Monday night, and normal use (not constantly using it all day long, but all throughout the day) with the keyboard attached for the most part, and it lasted until Thursday night! One of the main reasons I held off on buying a tablet is because I figured that with its bigger screen, in comparison to the iPhone, and considering how much I have to charge my iPhone (about 2-3 times a day), that I would be charging a tablet all day long.\n\nNot the case with this tablet. Its a powerhouse! And the brightness is so AMAZING that I barely have to turn it up much. But when you do turn up the brightness...WOW!\n\nOverall, I probably keep mine set around the 30% area. This is probably why my battery life lasted for so many days. And as they say with all electronics, the battery life gets better as you go, so I can only imagine!\n\nIf you plan on buying this tablet I recommend getting the keyboard attachment as well. Not just because of the extended battery life, which it does so well, but also because it doubles as a screen protector when it is closed and a nice stand to hold your tablet up, (although, it is a bit top heavy, so just be careful it doesnt fall over).\n\nI winded up buying the Dark Grey colored tablet, but I decided I wanted to get the light gray keyboard instead of the matching color keyboard. I'm glad I did. Not only was the price $50 less, but I think the keys are more visible with the lighter gray background than they would be with the dark color background and dark colored keys.\n\nI was afraid it would look stupid at first, but it looks Really good with the contrast of both colors. So even if they were priced the same, I would still go for the lighter gray in the end.\n\nI opted for the older 'Prime' keyboard (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Asus-Transformer-Prime-TF201-Mobile-Docking-Champagne-TF201-DOCK-CG/dp/B00685ZCZY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Asus Transformer Prime TF201 Mobile Docking - Champagne (TF201-DOCK-CG)</a>&nbsp;used...works good as new) after reading reviews that it works with the Infinity despite the claims of Asus that it will not work. I can confirm that it does work and it fits perfectly. I don't feel like I am forcing anything into place.\n\nAs for the touch responsiveness, some things can be annoying at times, like when surfing the web and clicking links. It seems to press the wrong link a lot. My smaller screened iPhone knows what I am trying to press better than this bigger tablet does at times.\n\nIve been saying this since day one, and it still holds true that nothing compares to the touch sensitivity of Apple's line of touch products. But this isn't too far off. Hopefully I will see even better improvements when Jellybean is released for the Infinity. Fingers crossed.\n\nThe sound, as others have said, is not that good. I am not a very picky person, but I could barely hear some videos I was watching at times. Especially if there's a YouTube video that was recorded low.\n\nI am overall impressed with the app selections. I like that I have an iPhone and an Android Tablet. It makes my world of app selections that much bigger.\n\nI recommend this tablet, especially to anyone who owns an iPhone and is in the market for a tablet. Its a nice escape from the usual and it opens up your arsenal to both Apple Apps and Android App worlds.\n\nHope this helped! Enjoy!\n\n***UPDATE\n\nAnother thing I want to mention that I've haven't seen mentioned much is that this tablet comes with a cloth to wipe down your screen. This is the best finger print removing cloth I have ever owned. I barely even rub it across the screen and its perfectly clear.\n\nI also updated my memory with a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Samsung-32GB-Class-10-MicroSDHC-High-Speed-Memory-Card-with-Komputerbay-SD-Adapter-and-SanDisk-MobileMate-USB-Reader/dp/B00768ZS4W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Samsung 32GB Class 10 MicroSDHC High Speed Memory Card with Komputerbay SD Adapter and SanDisk MobileMate USB Reader</a>.

They look nice, have the latest features, great specs, and reasonable pricing.  Unfortunately, I have had problems with eight over three different models that were defective.  For the purposes of this review, I'll stick to the TF700.  After setting the tablet up, I noticed two dead pixels rather quickly.  Not good when the display is one of the major items marketed...strike one.  The sound would stop working.  It required a reboot to bring it back each time...strike two.  Performance was poor.  The tablet was very unresponsive when performing simple tasks such as loading web pages...strike three.\n\nOn the plus side, it felt nice in the hand and the display was rather bright and looked nice, but ultimately, the display experience was ruined with the dead pixels.\n\nAdmittedly, I didn't try a replacement TF700, so perhaps this is an exception rather than the rule, but it matched my experience with their other tablet products, so defects have become my expectation for them.\n\nI can safely say that I won't be supporting Asus any more."}

No shutter lag, motion distortion, or bleaching.

This review will have a follow up down the road, new stuff does not weigh in heavily.  I won't bother with all the tech specs, benchmarks and stuff like that because there is enough of it already posted.  I hesitated for two weeks due to the reviews about the glass / frame fit.  Non existent here.\n\nThis tablet arrived in perfect condition and appeared to be well constructed.  Right out of the box it was a joy to behold and the software/hardware experience was excellent.  My wife and I both have used this tablet a lot everyday and I have really tried to stress it.  I am very familiar with the ipad3/ios.  My kids have them and they are nice but I really like this baby.  Smooth, fast and responsive.\n\nHD vids look great and I don't experience lag.  I converted a HD video to MP4 and it was flawless.  The resolution is stunning and the ipad is the only thing that can beat this screen but my eyes can't tell the difference between the two.  The Infinity has so much more going for it in regard to upgradable memory on the tablet and the dock.\n\nGPS is excellent and I get a good signal indoors too.  Wifi = excellent.  I have used PDAnet / Foxfi to have wireless ( 3G ) connection via my cellphone when I am away from a Wifi connection.  Works good as long as you have a good 3G/4G phone connections.\n\nApps.... well they are coming and there are some good ones out there.  I like the stock book reader and the Kindle app does just fine with mobie files.  I like reading books on the Infinity better than our Kindle Fire because you have more page / text.  But we still like the Fire too.  The tapered edges take getting used to for book reading.  The Fire handles like a small heavy book and this feels like a tapered glass slate.\n\nThis is great for email, IM, talk apps and video calling much better than any phone.  The cameras are the best of any tablet I've seen.  I have been waiting on the Windows tablets and phones for over a year now and I think I might just get another Infinity since it will be the end of the year before they debut and I never buy anything that is new to the market.  I always give it some upgrade time as I did with this.  The first transformers were crap but this Infinity is just great right now.  I will give this tab some more abuse time and tell all. By then I will have two Infinity tablets to compare and give everyone our findings.\n\nMost everything ASUS says about this tablet is true.  I've got 3 ASUS laptops (new to 3 yrs old) and now this.  So far I've had very good luck with my ASUS technology. I had one bump with an early EeePC.  The screen pixilated and to my surprise ASUS fixed and returned it fast.  I had read where ASUS support was lacking at times.\n\nMy gripes so far:  You have to use a usb dock adapter on the tablet specific to ASUS.\nSpeakers are sort of lacking.  You can hear fine as long as you cup your right hand behind the right side where the speaker is.  You need externals or a good set of ear-buds if you are watching a movie.\n\nAlive time is great.  I've pulled 7 busy hours with a 1.5 hr HD movie mixed in and still had plenty of time left for emails and general browser stuff.  I would like to know about how long the LI battery will last and how much of a hassle it will be to have another one put in.\n\nI say if you want a good tablet and you want to chance it on a 10 day simple review then get this thing.  I am very happy with it and I am rather critical about equipment. This thing rocks, holds its own to the ipad3, AND you get much more versatility with this Infinity.\n\nJust edited this for easier reading (had someone complain) and I ordered another Infinity.  No sharing now! The one coming in tomorrow will be 64GB. I'll let you know how it all works out."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "My first tablet was a Motorola Zoom. This new Asus TF700 blows it away on every point. With the keyboard attached the onboard memory capacity is unsurpassed by anything out there. The screen is crisp, bright and useable in sunlight. Touch is fast, accurate and responsive. Wifi connects fast and has decent range. GPS is off by 10 feet but plenty good enough for navigating. My Zoom was scary accurate. Battery is on par with most other tablets and the keyboard dock does add half again as much life. I must recommend getting the keyboard with the tablet. It will allow you to use thumbdrives, larger SD cards and pocket drives. This is definitely the best android tablet out there."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I am a previous owner of the Prime now used by my wife instead of her Fire, and current owner of the Infinity.  The tablet is great and has almost replaced my laptop.  At work I use both the tablet and the laptop, preferring a multiple display workstation that the laptop supports.  At home I can do just about everything on just the tablet.  The differences between the Prime and Infinity are subtle.  Higher resolution, and much better GPS performance.  For most applications, you don't notice the resolution difference between the models.  The keyboard dock for the Prime also fits the Infinity.  I made the mistake of buying the new dock thinking it was different, but the factory box clearly showed both tablets use the dock.  I rarely use the dock unless travelling without a laptop.  The display is bright enough to use in direct sunlight, and automatically adjusts to light conditions if using the auto mode.  My Prime cases also fit the Infinity.  I saw other reviews suggesting they were different and couldn't be interchanged.\n\nI am very happy with both tablets."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "So everyone has a lot to say about the best Android tablet (currently) on the market.  I'm not going to bore you with the technical details of the tablet.  I waited to purchase a tablet for a long time.  This would have been the perfect tablet except it only has one speaker which is covered by your right hand when holding it (in landscape mode).  Very few tablets have the speakers on the front (like the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2) where they belong.  I loved everything about this tablet (the speed and especially the screen) but since I was shelling out top dollar, the single speaker was not acceptable to me so it was returned.  Sure, I could wear headphones but I'm not 15 anymore.  If Asus would only listen and learn, they would have had a real winner here!"}

Finish on the back of the product had some minor scratches..plastic strip with camera also had some finishing issues...glass on the top shows bend in places where camera, micro sdcard slot and charge port exist, also glass not set properly on the lower left corner...not something you would expect on the 500$ price tag product.\n\nDecided to overlook the cosmetic issues and started the tablet...charged fully as recommended.

Only problem right now is a slight (1/4 - 1/2 second) lag when watching video and using bluetooth headphones (wired earbuds, no problem). I talked to ASUS and they are on it.

But I think that right now this is the best android tablet around.\n\nThe Screen es beautiful and the big internal memory (32GB in the one I bought) plus the microsd card is the way to go, that was the deal killer with the nexus 7. has a nice felling and I could handle it for long period of time.\n\nthe downsides this tablet as apparently other tegra 3 tablets overheats a bit. not to the extreme to be uncomfortable, but is noticeable. also as the sides are curved the custom connection don't have a way to set solidly, because this the metal around the connector can get bent and the connection may brake if forced.\n\nThe placement of the speaker also is a problem as that is the location that your hand usually goes when you are holding it on landscape mode. and being on the back of the tablet the sound goes away from you. making the headphones a necessity.\n\nThat being said It has been a good experience so far, I even used as a GPS replacement using CoPilot + Ivona Text to Voice.\n\nIf you like the flexibility and Customization of Android, Buy on Google Play and don't mind a bit of instability, this is a good choice.\n\nBTW for the you will need a special USB Charger for the car, as this baby charges with 15v output USB so the regular charges won't do."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I read more reviews than I can count regarding this tablet, the good and the bad.  Before I go any further, I am the IT Director for my company, just to set the stage.  At $500 purchasing this was a major decision.  I don't mind laying out the cash, especially if it will assist me in my job duties.  First, as far as the negative reviews of this item are concerned, I'm not sure what was expected.  Due to complaints about the screen flexing on the edges when squeezed, I decided to purchase locally.  I have seen what shipping companies can due to a package regardless of how careful the sellers may package the product.  In any case, the TF700 was rock solid out of the box, no give, and no flex.  Bleeding at the bottom edge has also been a concern, and I did notice some, but nothing more than some light reflection, and no real issue.  I only noticed this at boot up on a totally black screen, and don't consider it an issue.  Battery life, most report about 7 hours give or take.  I have a lap top that cost 6 times this TF700 and would love to see 7 hours of battery life out of it.  That said, I turned on everything that I could find, Performance Mode, Highest Screen Resolution, Blue Tooth, etc.  With these setting you will get no where near 7 hours, but then again I didn't see any real need for these, maybe in special circumstances or occasionally, but not consistently at least for me.  Unexpected shutdowns have also been reported.  I wonder about this.  Out of the box, the unit is set to go to sleep after 1 minute of inactivity.  I suspect that like most computers, this tablet measures activity by touch.  In other words, a computer measures activity by keyboard stroke or mouse movement.  Downloading or video streaming is not seen as activity on the part of the computer.  I suspect the TF700 measures activity by screen touch or keyboard activity if you have one.  The sleep setting can be increased or turned off completely.  On the plus side, the TF700 is everything that the positive reviews claim.  Enough said!  So why did I take it back.  As I said, I work IT, and I don't play games either on my computer or my tablet.  I do read a book or sometimes watch a movie.  The TF700 is flawless for these purposes, and I suspect it is just as good at playing games.  The display resolution is great.  For business related IT issues however, there were some problems.  Some if not all of these were not actually related to the TF700.  Cisco provides a free AnyConnect app on Google Play.  I use this application on my computers all the time.  What Cisco doesn't tell you is that while the app is free connecting to an ASA is not.  For some reason, \"PURE GREED\", Cisco wants you to purchase a license for each firewall you wish to connect to.  Ten firewalls means ten licenses.  Why this need for a license is completely confusing.  You can get Cisco AnyConnect all day long and attach to your ASA for free using a computer.  Why they think they should charge for tablet access is as I said, \"PURE GREED\".  The workaround for this would have been to get a VPN Client, which there are many out there.  Unfortunately, I couldn't get any of them to work successfully, we use a IPsec/UPD configuration and maybe this is the reason.  Finally, the TF700 consistently gets compared with the IPad.  At least in my area there is a significant difference in price.  People who love Apple will undoubtedly say that there is a reason for this.  I looked at the new IPad as well as the TF700 and didn't really see anything that justified the extra expense.  Don't get me wrong, Apple makes a fine product, but the Brand Name comes with a cost.  For the average user the TF700 is a solid 5 as far as my rating.  I gave it a 4 due to business related concerns.  If you want a tablet for general use, this is a great product.  If you want it for business related items, be cautious and check exactly what you are expecting it to do, as well as app availability."}

It's a little uncomfortable, but a thin leather case mitigates that.\n- It's not easy to mount the tablet on a Linux computer even though Android is based on Linux...\n- It's not easy to mount the device in debug/developer mode.\n\nFor me, the pros outweigh the cons, and it's still one of the top 3 tablets out there."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I got this tablet for work to kill two birds with one stone- getting a laptop replacement and an android test device for the price of a low end laptop.\nThe primary use is email and rdp support (applications support and even software development by rdp on a remote PC).\nThe secondary use being for testing mobile web and application software.\n\nSo far I have been very impressed with the Tablet. It works smoothly and has few lags, in spite of using an active desktop (I am not one for frills usually, but the floating ice cubes one shows battery status by the water level on screen, which I thought both cool and useful).\n\nSure, there is the odd thing that is not perfect- stability when using in the docking station, a very slight sponginess on the screen at one point on one edge (very minor and causes absolutely no problems, but just noticeable).\n\nI am using the Infinity as primarily a work machine, so I have not delved deep into things like video support and playback. What I can say is that it does what I need it to, and what I bought it for very well. The screen resolution is great- I can rdp into my desktop PC at full resolution and work in a visual studio like environment. It is obviously not as good as being in front of the PC, but the ability to pinch and zoom the view means that it is actually more productive than the wide screen Laptop it replaces. I am using the Jump rdp software, and have worked 3 rdp sessions deep (rdp to pc to server to VM) with no problems.\n\nAnother thing I have found surprisingly good is the Supernote software that came pre-installed. When combined with a stylus pen this has made taking handwritten notes viable. (I had tried earlier versions of tablets and found them to be insufficiently responsive to properly write on).\n\nBattery life has been everything promised. I was caught at home having run down to about 10% battery only to find I had left the charger at work, then had two overnight support calls which took somewhere between 30 min and an hour in total to resolve. The Infinity coped with this and still had some charge left to check email in the morning.\n\nOn its own, I don't know if I would have gone for the tablet- for what I am doing, but when combined with the keyboard dock it is a real winner. The keyboard is not fantastic, but is about what I would expect given the size- more than adequate for what I use it for. Having USB is great, as being able to use a mouse for fine RDP work is a bonus.\n\nAll in all, if the rating system allowed I would give a 4 1/2 star to the product."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I was fortunate to be able to compare the Prime and Infinity tablets side-by-side at Office Depot before purchase. The Infinity's display is much brighter and clearer than the Prime's--the increased pixel density gives the Infinity a greatly improved display. The Infinity continues the Prime's thin, strong, lightweight design but adds a small plastic strip along the back to improve antenna action for wifi and GPS. This doesn't detract from the tablet's appearance IMO.\n\nSo far I've encountered no issues (as described by some others) with wifi connections to either my home network (even at over 50 feet from the modem) or to my HTC mobile phone hotspot. I've seen only one Internet glitch in a couple of days' testing: The New York Times website froze with a partly blank screen and had to be closed and reopened for browsing. Other than that, Internet access and downloads seem fast and smooth.\n\nThe Infinity's GPS/Google Location services work flawlessly with Google Maps. Coupled with the high-resolution display, this is why I bought this tablet, and I'm looking forward to taking it with me on the road.\n\nOne sour note, though: the so-called 8MP camera on the Infinity is nowhere near the quality it should be, as compared to my HTC Thunderbolt's 8MP camera. (It's not just the larger tablet display: I've uploaded pictures from both devices to my desktop computer for comparison.) Seriously, this tablet's camera pictures resemble those of the earliest flip camera phones...were those VGA? I exchanged the tablet after one day because of this issue, but both Infinity tablets I've tested have poor camera quality. Admittedly, the camera is not why I bought this tablet. But the best camera is (or should be) the one in your hand when you need it, and it's too bad the Infinity's camera has such poor resolution--particular if you try to zoom in at all. Also, when you record video, the sound drops out to zero rather than recording continuously during low sound levels. The panorama feature works smoothly, but again is impaired by the overall poor picture quality.\n\nActually, I'll add another sour note: pictures load low-resolution and then reload stripe by stripe into high resolution--even the pictures that are preloaded in the Infinity's memory. I'm hoping I don't encounter this when I try reviewing my DSLR camera pictures in the field on this tablet, but I think I probably will see it there also. If I were interested in gaming or watching movies on the Infinity, I'd be concerned about this slow graphics rendering. However, HD YouTube videos seem to stream smoothly.\n\nAbout the docking keyboard: on the advice of many reviewers, and because Office Depot had only Prime keyboards in stock, I tried pairing the Infinity with the Prime docking station. It fit, but very tightly (tight enough to scratch the screen protector I'd put on the tablet). So I've ordered the docking station designed for the Infinity from Amazon. Its extra battery power will be welcome because the Infinity tablet does indeed, as others have noted, have a short battery life (not in standby but in actual use).\n\nI'm pleased with the lack of bloatware on the Infinity tablet.\n\nYes, as other reviewers have noted, the speaker sound quality is poor. That's why the tablet has a headset jack and Bluetooth. One should not expect fine sound quality from a tiny little speaker.\n\nOne thing to note: I was able to install Flash on my Infinity. However, it appears that Flash will no longer be available for download to devices that don't already have it after August 15, 2012, and will not be available for download to Android devices with OS versions higher than 4.0.x (translation: Jelly Bean and later). We'll see how this battle between Adobe and Google plays out.\n\nOverall, I recommend this tablet for its excellent, clear, bright, and smooth display of Internet content and maps, but don't count on getting nice pictures with its camera.\n\nUpdate 8/14/12: I received the Infinity docking keyboard today. As others have noted, it's clearly labeled as a TF201T or TF700T dock, and the internal model number is TF201. However, it does fit my tablet better than the Prime-labeled dock. What's interesting is that I tested the dock's USB connection to my precious DSLR camera, and that works fine: I can review my photography results on the Infinity's high-quality display, with only a tiny, almost imperceptible graphics rendering delay for 16MB picture files. But I also ordered the ASUS \"dongle\" to attach a USB device directly to the tablet, and that does NOT work to connect my DSLR camera to the tablet. So I'm very glad to have that dock."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "UPDATE: I've had my Infinity a few weeks now, so I can offer a better impression of the tablet.\n\nOverall, this is a very good tablet, but it still has some of the same issues that have plagued Android tablets since the beginning.\n\nFirst the good:\n\n- The screen resolution is outstanding.\n- Video playback is excellent.\n- The processor is snappy and responsive.\n- It has more than enough on-board storage memory for most tasks, making an SD card almost redundant unless you plan to store large amounts of large files.\n- The interface is good.\n- ASUS is very good about pushing updates.\n- The speaker is adequate for its size and positioning.\n\nAnd then the bad:\n\n- The battery life is average--which is to say mediocre--under regular use. (This problem is solved using the docking station)\n- Like most Android tablets, it does not have enough RAM and gets bogged down under heavier use (though, interestingly, not during video playback)\n- The WiFi antenna is terrible as with most tablets.\n- Most of the bundled software is useless.\n- The Android task manager is useless. (This is not really an Infinity problem but it is really annoying)\n\nOverall, I would recommend this tablet to anyone looking for a higher end device, especially if you're going to use it for video playback or gaming.\n\n-----\n\nORIGINAL: I've had my Infinity for a few days now, so this review is a first impression.\n\nThe tablet is solid and, as a result, a little heavy compared to the Galaxy Tab 10.1 that I am comparing it to. The screen resolution is outstanding and, so far, things like video playback live up to the hype this tablet got when it was released. This tablet is much, much faster that the previous generation and is able to handle complex tasks like running remote desktop sessions without too much trouble.\n\nThe battery suffers a little under heavy usage, but it charges quickly and seems to hold up well under average daily use.\n\nMy only complaints so far are with the bloatware Asus (and most manufacturers) feel the need to heap on their products and with the docking station mechanism.\n\nSo far, so good."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "UPDATE\n\n9/27/2012\nSo I came back from Galaxy Note 10.1 because I just could not tolerate non-Full HD screen any more after using Infinity.  I tried to convince myself it would be ok, but it wasn't. The biggest concern coming back to infinity were relatively frequent application not responding error (ANR) and random application crash/close especially on browser, and relatively but significantly slower speed of browser page loading compared to iPad 2 or Galaxy Note 10.1.  However, with a little tweaks I am now very satisfied with infinity as those concerns are now significantly improved to almost completely fixed.\n- See Stability section for added Tips\n- Conclusion updated\n\n8/31/2012\n- Wifi related battery issue is not unit based, but through out the all unit (according to the quick survey at XDA) See battery life section\n- See new section on Quality Control Issue: In short, make sure to purchase infinity from a place where you can exchange/return.\n- Compare to upcoming Windows 8 Tablets\n\n8/19/2012\nHad to down grade score to 4 after using Galaxy Note 10.1.  Please see\n- Stability/smoothness\n- Conclusion\n\n8/15/2012\n- Performance Boost Tip (see speed section)\n- Multitasking updated\n\n=====================\nCompared to recently announced upcoming Windows 8 tablets\n======================\n\nRecently, multiple windows 8 tablets have been officially announced with their detailed specifications and prices.  For some of you considering this vs. windows 8 tablet, based on the specifications, I concluded following:\n\n\"No windows 8 tablet is completely superior to Transformer Infinity or Galaxy Note 10.1\"\n\nMajor players are followings:\n\nSamsung ativ series:  The only one that has Full HD screen is Smart Pro version, which costs >$1000, and DVD play battery time is 5 hours.  Infinity by tablet alone has documented video play time of 9.5 hours, which becomes mere 5 hours with web browsing and 3-4 hours with playing games.  So what could the 5 hours really be.  Such short battery life is not acceptable for me.  Other ativ series do not have full HD, and priced higher.\n\nAsus vivo series: None of them actually has full HD screen.\n\nThe benefit of Windows 8 only comes if you purchase Pro version as RT version will only run windows metro specific applications, which will likely to grow in number but won't be for a while to before catching up with Android (my guess).  But Pro version tablets are much higher price, and heavier.\n\nSo they are not necessary inferior, but for those of you like me was looking forward to see one \"this is it!\" system, that is not ready.  Windows 8 tablets have their own drawbacks/design decision mainly weight, battery life, price, and lack of full HD screen.\n\n====================\nORIGINAL REVIEW\n=====================\n\nIt is not my personal opinion, but if you search around the web for major review sites, pretty much it is unanimous that this tablet is the king of 10 inch Android Tablet at this moment (8/2012). As with no system is perfect; otherwise, nobody would ever make newer model again, this indeed has some room for improvement. Since I currently or previously own(ed) ipad2, Samsung galaxy 10.1 (both wifi only 4G LTE), and Xoom, I have decided to put a little comparison from my experience to indicate what aspect of this system I am truly impressed with but also what aspect can be further improved in the future models.\n\n========= Why I chose Android Ecosystem ==========\n\niOS vs. Android may be the one biggest question potential tablet buyer must answer first. The most popular tablet by far is indeed Apple's Ipad series. They are great. Very smooth and stable. For me coming from Android system, then to iOS, then back to Android system, followings were what I looked before coming back to Android ecosystem:\n\n------------------ Android Ecosystem Pros ------------------------\n\n1. Storage expansion\n- I have relatively large collection of videos that I like to carry around. I would rather swap back and forth microSD than the transfer files from computer every time. So this was one big factor for me.\n2. True Mutitask\nIn iOS, multitasking is very limited and in my opinion there is no TRUE multitasking there. For instance, if I start download a file over the internet, and leave the application and do something else such as reading ebook, the file downloading quickly goes into frozen state i.e. not really downloading in background. On the other hand, Android will let you download things in background and you can do other things in the mean time.\n\n(8/15)Recently, I was a bit intrigued by the introduction of Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1, which offers split window capability (not for every applications but browser, polaris office, note taking application, video covers for me).  With this news, one of forum poster actually referred me to multiple applications that are already out there on market that essentially does similar and perhaps better to certain degree.  For instance, if you like to browse a web but do something else e.g. read ebook, use office of your choice, or perhaps even browse two different sites.  The application is called \"Oversckreen.\"  This is type of things that I believe true multitasking and flexibility of the android shines.\n\n3. Data Transfer\n- Transferring data using proprietary application (iTune) with USB connection became quickly very restrictive for me. We could bypass this by using cloud storage but that required uploading file first then download. On the contrary, in Android you can plug in the system via USB and transfer data by drag and drop using folder system on either Windows or Mac OS. Alternatively, you can use application such as AirDroid to transfer file over the WIFI with desktop like interface through browser.\n4. Centralized File System\n- In android, it uses similar tree file system as desktops. So I can create my own folder organization, and any application can use the folder structure. This is handy for me. For example, I have many PDF and EPUB books. For me these are nothing but ebooks. So I like to organize them in the same folder(s). However, some application does better job opening PDF than the other, but for EPUB I use different application. But this won't affect storage for me as files are still single copy one location where I placed. Whereas in iOS, each application gets own copy. So for some reason I want to open PDF in one application but then reopen on the other application, I have to create two copies in the system.\n5. User interface\niOS has simple interface that nobody should have any difficulty with. This can be pros for many, but personally, I enjoy more customization. I like to see fancy widget like home screen quickly showing weather, news etc. People also frequently hear calling Android ecosystem is more \"flexible.\" My take on this is that Android ecosystem allows you to change home screen not only with widgets but even whole interface i.e. launcher. So certainly not as simple as iOS, I prefer such on Android system. It just simply more fun for me.\n6. FLASH support\nThis will be going away entirely from mobile platform. However, it will take time. No new device be supported at this point, but existing devices including transformer infinity is still supported. When Jellybean update comes, though there is no official support, no doubt we will still see easy way to load FLASH on android device. In fact, Nexus device user with Jellybean update confirmed they can still use Flash on their devices. So some day everything will be HTML5, but until then I like Flash compatibility.\n\n------------------ Android Ecosystem Cons ------------------------\n\nSo above are in strength of the android system (obviously in my personal opinion). The downside is\n\n1. Stability/Smoothness\nAndroid had came quite far since the initial tablet optimized android OS Honeycomb introduction. The current version (Ice cream sandwich) is far more stable and smooth than the Honeycomb. However, applications still do crush on Infinity. Some are not too infrequent. Initially I wrote \"one main reason may be due to so many hardware out there, developers have no control/way to test on every single device. In my experience, it is most of time finding the right application.\"  Well, I guess I was blind.  Recently I purchased Galaxy Note 10.1.  After 20+ hours of use, I have yet to encounter single crush or ANR (application not responding).  I basically do the exactly same with Galaxy Note and Infinity.  Infinity give me at least one crush or ANR every hour or two.\n\n2. Applications\nOverall, iOS has more applications optimized for tablet. Many games are initially released on iOS then later ported to Android. If gaming on tablet is primarily interest, iOS is undoubtedly the way to go. However, some applications are better on Android. For instance, application called \"Anki\", which is probably the best cross platform flashcard application, you can get it for FREE on android with WIFI sync of stats and cards. Whereas, iOS you have to pay $20+ to purchase the application. Android has easy 15 minutes trial and refund policy, so I don't have to waste money to find out whether an application is what I truly wanted.\n\n========= Transformer Infinity ==========\nOnce you made your mind with Android ecosystem, here are what's special about transformer infinity.\n\n------------------ Pros ------------------------\n1. Speed\nI am not certain why some complains of smoothness/speed. But swiping home screen, launching applications on this device is extremely smooth and fast for me. One big sales point of the newest android OS Jellybean will be \"Buttery smooth\" interface; however, I am not sure if I will see any difference from what I already have here because it is already buttery smooth. Benchmarks are simply numbers, but check them out on google. You will see infinity indeed has the top notch benchmark scores across the board among all the existing android tablet. For instance, I use application called Mantano reader for my ebook. They have recently added page curl effect for epub book reading like iBook. It is so smooth on Infinity that I see no difference from iBook. But this may not be true for some older systems with lower specifications.\n\n[Tips] This is only true if you are running in balanced or performance mode. Battery save mode indeed sees a lag/stuttering.\n\n(8/15) I had not had an issue with original or replaced unit, but if your unit runs surprisingly slow. It sounds like \"factory reset\" had helped some.  So try it out.  But true performance boost was immediately noticed, and perhaps stability improvement as well after reading an article at XDA forum.  If you are interested, try search \"tweaks to sweeten your life with the Infinity.\"  If not, this at least proves that ASUS can eventually with software update make this tablet even much faster.\n\n2. HD Screen\nThis is main advantage of this device over the other android tablet. Basically, you are paying for this feature. The upcoming Galaxy Note 10.1 has equivalent CPU benchmark and better GPU benchmark; however, it lacks HD screen. There is currently not much (if any) HD optimized application on android market but you don't really need them to see its effect on daily use. When you surf web, read ebooks, the texts are crystal clear. If HD screen is what you want, you only have two choice in Android market right now. Acer A500 and this machine. Every site that I saw basically puts Infinity over the A500 despite $50 more.\n\n3. ASUS reputation\nASUS does have its own problem. However, when comes to software update they are among the best. They have introduced Ice cream sandwitch before anybody else except google device e.g. xoom or nexus. People complained about poor I/O perfomance, they have already released firmware less than a month since the device release to fix this. There is no doubt aside from Xoom and Nexus 7, transformer series will be the first to see Jellybean update.\n\n*In comparison, Samsung makes great tablet but they customize the OS quite bit and resulting in extremely slow update. They have just recently updated to ice cream sandwich on their original Galaxy Tablet series, which is like 6 months behind that of ASUS.\n\n4. Keyboard Dock\nYou can use keyboard on any Android tablet whether bluetooth or USB. The key difference here is that transformer series keyboard will extend the battery life and attaches to tablet and makes the tablet like laptop. Since I have not purchased one yet, I cannot say much about this.\n\n[Rumor] Many rumors are floating around that transformer prime keyboard dock is indeed the same as that of transformer infinity except now priced higher. One most objective argument I have seen regarding to this is on the XDA forum. One user disassembled both and basically saw everything being the exactly the same. ASUS representative says otherwise, but no convincing proof has been provided so far.\n\n5. Future Proof\nTablet market is perhaps the most rapidly evolving field. If you wait 3-4 months, there will be better specification system on the market. However, Infinity being the top of notch at this point and similar but superior to the Nexus 7, we can safely say that this device will have relatively good future proof for a while before its gets obsolete. No doubt we will get newer OS even after Jellybean.\n\nUpcoming Galaxy Note 10.1 will have 2GB of memory, which is great and I wish we had it on Infinity; however, it being the only system with that, and many will be at 1GB we will not see any application that requires 2GB memory for awhile. Though larger memory will certainly help multitasking.\n\n------------------ Cons ------------------------\n1. Battery Life\nPersonally, this is one major downside of the system. The system has higher pixels to push compared to transformer prime, yet has the identical battery. In comparison, New iPad doubled its battery from iPad 2 to sustain its battery life. ASUS claims 9.5 hours of battery with tablet alone. In balanced mode with WIFI on but watching local video or reading ebook under 30% or so monitor setting, I get ~10%/hr battery loss. So it is possible to get the number. However, if you surf the web the battery life quickly goes down. With WiFi surfing and online streaming, the battery drain becomes ~20%/hr i.e. only lasts 5-6 hours. This seems a bit low. Couple tricks to save battery life exist including changing to Power Saving mode, which would add 1-2 hours extra, but system becomes overall laggy. Adding dock will bring up the battery life to top of its kind; however, I still prefer seeing 9-10 hours battery with constant web surf without dock.\n\nNote: These numbers are screen on time. I can easily get over a day if including the screen off time.\n\nI initially thought it was fault on my device as some claims phenomenal battery life, so I did got exchange but still the same. Those claiming over 10hours battery life is undoubtedly talking about \"off charger but not on-screen\" time. Those who claims on-screen time of >6 hours have minimal WIFI use (not it is on or off but actively browsing or not).  I have sent an email to ASUS rep about this to see if they can potentially fix it as other tablet usually won't have this much difference in battery use just by using browser.\n\n[TIPS] For those of you getting too much drain from WIFI while screen is off, go to setting > WIFI > advanced and select WIFI on while sleep to \"never\". This way when your system is off, you won't see drain in battery.\n\n2. USB File Transfer Speed\nWhen compared to my iPad 2, file transfer speed across the USB is slower on transformer infinity despite using the latest firmware .26. The time I transfer files are not so frequent and I can even download files in background and do something else, but it is certainly nice to have maximum speed when hooked on to USB as those are times I want to transfer big file as quickly as possible.\n\n3. Sound\nIt talks about Sonic System but sound on this machine is definitely weakness. Sometimes I have difficulty hearing via speaker. Fortunately, I use mostly with headphone but if someone wants to watch a movie on this device using a built in speaker and expecting high quality, you may be a bit disappointed on this regards.\n\n[Tips] You can potentially boost the sound beyond the manufacture's setting. But this shouldn't be necessary.\n\n4. Quality Control (added 8/31)\nBased on my daily checking of forums on transformer infinity, I can confidently conclude that quality control on the transformer infinity have some major flaw.  Some may try to defend saying that they got a perfect unit, which is great for them.  Others may say every company has defective unit, which is true statement.  However, if you look at forum such as XDA, you see so many people complains of issues.  In contrast, if you check forum for Galaxy Note 10.1, you basically see 1/10th of hardware related complain.  This overall make ASUS a huge loss in my opinion.  Because we don't know if the system instability, slow speed etc. is actually from the system or simply faulty unit.  Some may not even consider latter and instead just return. Because of relatively high prevalence of QC issue, I highly recommend buying infinity from a place where you can exchange/return.\n\n------------------ Mixed ------------------------\n1. Build Quality\nOverall the unit looks phenomenal. Compared to my previous plastic made Galaxy 10.1 which port hinge cracked without any major physical damage and Samsung refused to replace... Solid metallic feeling, beautiful concentric design of ZEN. It definitely feels like high quality tablet. My original nor replacement unit had single dead pixel, so that's a good thing. However, if you become nit picky, you finds a few (minor) but noticeable issues including:\n- Light bleed: Only noticeable during boot up so should not affect actual use but they are there. Supposedly pretty common based on some forum.\n- Clicking sound: My initial tablet did have this and many others experience this according to XDA forum. Most likely due to slightly loose attachment around the screen. Again, this does not affect daily use but this one was certainly noticeable to me. Replaced unit did not have this but got more light bleed.\n- Soft button: Original unit had some asymmetric softness to the volume up button, and replaced unit has that on the power button.\n\n2. Stability\nThis may not be due to hardware but rather applications but applications do crash at least several times during my charge cycle. Particularly, noticeable is on the browser. It does not matter if stock, chrome, or other popular third party browsers. They still give me random close. Mainly with flash site though. I hope this will improve with Jellybean but it emphasizes \"smoothness\" not \"stability\" so who knows.\n\n(8/19) After using Galaxy Note 10.1, I am not sure if it is due to software or hardware.  Because Galaxy note 10.1 also uses Ice cream sandwich but after 20+ hours of use, I have experience 0 crush or freeze.  Even on the file I could not open (pdf on mantano reader), I can readily open with Galaxy Note 10.1.  It is possible that Samsung did extensive customization/kernel design and ASUS did not so it is software related, but in any event when compared to the most stable systems i.e. iPad or Galaxy Note 10.1 (yes. so far that system is stable as iPad or could be even more.. who knows as I haven't experience single crush on this I don't know how good/bad it is), infinity definitely lacks stability.  Though I don't think it is any worse than my old Samsung Galaxy 10.1 or Xoom.\n\n(9/27) I am not certain whether it was related due to defective hardware for my original units, firmware update improvement, or turning off the bloatware.  But at this point, I have encountered only handful application random crash, and probably same or less number of ANR after two weeks.  This is essentially compatible to my experience on Galaxy Note 10.1, and iPad 2.  So from my side, only one special thing I did here, which is \"turning off bloatware.\"  ASUS includes many application that runs on background. These can be turned off without you rooting or unlocking the device.  So I highly recommend doing this.  For the exact list of which application can be turned off, see XDA forum.\n\n3. Power Save Mode\nIt is nice to have an option to extend battery a little as it is indeed the biggest weakness of this unit. However, noticeable lag by switching to it seems a bit of issue. I understand becoming laggy on demanding applications such as games but just swiping home screen, launching application should still be smooth. I wonder if Jellybean will fix this.\n\n========= Conclusion ==========\nOverall, I now give 5/5. This is the best android table on market. Main advantage are full HD screen, ASUS's continuous support with timely updates, top notch hardware spec at the moment makes this is future proof device. However, battery life is sub-optimal for today's tablet standard when used tablet alone with WIFI on, and built in speaker is weakness.  Also, quality control issue of ASUS product suffer, so be sure to get this from where you can exchange as you have relatively high chance receiving defective product.\n\nOut of box, this item may be slightly inferior in a few area compared to Galaxy Note 10.1.  In particular, browser speed and overall smoothness and speed on ICS.  These however, can be improved by simple fixes.  1. Turn of bloatware (no root/unlock needed). 2. If you still think browser is slow, then supposedly, you can install an application called browser2ram. However, for this you supposedly need to root the system.  But with these modifications, you can make infinity true king of the android tablet at the moment."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I really want to be able to give an Android tablet 5 stars, and I believe this is one of the best options in the market at the moment. Unfortunately there is still some growing to be done on the last few details in Android tablets. The ICS interface is really nice with improved alert, settings and application selection, but it has some shortcomings in general (not specific to any particular tablet). The single biggest problem is that scrolling and selection of links, menus and text boxes in the browser is jerky and unresponsive even with the quad core, and maybe this is to be fixed in 4.1 Jelly Bean. After using the tablet extensively, I have come to the conclusion that the problem is so bad that the tablet cannot replace my online driven usage of the laptop. Even reading the news is frustrating, and only the most casual browser usage is comfortable. It may be advisable for some buyers to wait until Jelly Bean comes on the tablet pre-installed.\n\nAsus has provided some good software, mostly preloaded Supernote, etc, that most people will use. There is no built in video player that will support play of videos copied to the memory, so you have to buy something like MX Player Pro. The upside is that the cloud syncing of Chrome is excellent, and it has led me to finally switch from Firefox on my laptop which has been crashing Flash. The biggest shortcomings in the tablet design specifically are no option with 4G (FoxFi linking to your Android phone works extremely well, but requires the extra steps of phone launch and having the phone handy), and the audio, while clear, really needs a higher maximum power output. It is a little under powered to be usable as a MP3 replacement with Pandora, for example, or for watching movies on an air plane (with good noise cancelling headphones) or for clear Skype communications. Even at home, I basically have it on max volume all of the time with headphone use. The built in speaker is really blah and middle of the road in performance. Battery life is good and easily extendable by turning off GPS and bluetooth and setting the tablet to power saving mode. The GPS is very good, and matched with the display is excellent for things such as weather radar maps and Google maps. I have not really tested the camera/camcorder app and capabilities, but it is appears just fine.\n\nHaving an open standard MicroSD is great for movie watchers or doc carriers like me, but the absence of an open standard USB is something that I still despise on tablets in general and this one specifically.\n\nPros:\n1. ICS interface improvements.\n2. Solid construction.\n3. Has MicroSD slot for documents or movies.\n4. Cloud sync'd Chrome browser.\n5. Very good GPS and excellent for mapping.\n\nCons:\n1. Headphone audio output not up to MP3 player capability and borderline for movie watching on planes.\n2. Built in speaker is average at best.\n3. No 4G (but FoxFi linking is so easy almost not a problem).\n4. Choppy scrolling and selection of links, text boxes, manipulation in browser is almost unusable.\n5. No open standard USB for charging and data transfer."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I got this tablet a week ago along with with the prime series docking station. I think the tablet is great. The GPS issues of the prime have been fixed. The tablet scores around 4500 on Quadrant Standard while in performance mode. The display quality is great. The auto brightness display mode from ASUS is still sub par. It always wants to put the display so dark that you can barely see the screen. Having ICS is nice but there are many apps that are not compatible with ICS yet. This is not an ASUS issue but it is worth noting in the overall experience of the tablet. For example, the Amazon app itself will not work. The mouse cursor on the docking station will periodically jump around which is annoying but again this is not really a knock against the tablet. Just typing this the cursor jumped to some random place 6 times. The battery life is as stated, ~9hours. Jelly Bean is promised on this tablet although no date is given. If this tablet is going to be an Ipad killer then it should have 2 gigs of RAM not 1 although I have ran into no issues thus far. Also, the Netflix app is so slow it is unusable on this tablet which sucks because I still have to use my laptop to watch Netflix. For an Android tablet, this is about the best you can get. I'm not an Apple fan but the Ipad gives a target for the Android tablets to strive for."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I have had mine for two weeks exactly now. I purposefully waited until I had throroughly checked it out before posting - as opposed to those who review after only a day or so of use and don't really know the device's \"personality\" yet.\n\nI will begin with saying that I love, Love, LOVE it! I was originally going to get the first Transformer, but as soon as I was going to get it, the Prime came out - then was sold out everywhere. After hearing all of the issues with the wifi and GPS, I decided to wait. Just as I was about to get the TF300, this was slated to come out days later. So, again, I waited. I'm sooo glad I did!\n\nI have very little negative to say about this device. I agree with some user comments about the sound (especially since I have a case on mine). But again, what do you expect from a tablet?! It sounds good, but simply needs more bass in my opinion. I stream movies on it and don't notice the difference - it's when playing music that you'll notice the bass lacking.\n\nMy only other \"negative\" with this tablet is the on screen keyboard. I'm not a fan of the Asus keyboard that comes up by default, so I changed it back to the Android keyboard in the settings. One of the reasons is the Asus keyboard doesn't include the microphone button for speech recognition (that I use regularly) and I wasn't a fan of the layout. Other than that, my only complaint is that it seems to miss the space button a lot when I type, but then again, that may just be me typing too fast and simply missing the key. Regardless of what other reviewers say, you can still type fast on this, especially once you get used to the layout (which you quickly do), as it is still a good keyboard with precise touch response.\n\nOn the plus side, everythiing else is awesome. It's fast (even on power saving mode), rarely lags any and rarely gets pixelated when streaming movies or tv shows from HBOGO, DirecTV, Crackle or TV.com. The rare times it had any problems streaming were very likely caused by my finicky internet connection (shared by my boyfriend's son who is a BIG online gamer). When I have connected though my Verizon phone as a mobile hotspot (through a tethering app very similar to what NiteLine was referring to) I had no problems whatsoever.\n\nAlthough I had read how wonderful the display was beforehand, it still surprised and amazed me right out of the box. Of course, as many have stated, there's not a lot of apps out there yet that really take advantage of the fast processor or awesome graphics capability. The tablet does comes preloaded with NVidia's Glow Ball which showcases its awesome 3D graphics. It's crisp, smooth and a little tricky to play. You balance the tablet so you roll the ball into the various jack-in-box's in a certain order so the big one will revel the escape route. The graphics of this game are phenomenal. Maybe in the future the lack of more RAM may become a problem as more and more graphics intensive games come out. But for the average user, I don't think it will be a problem.\n\nWith my use of mainly web surfing, streaming media or playing \"simpler\" non-rpg games, I get close to a full day out of one charge - plug it in when I go to bed at night and it's ready to go in the morning. I *hope* to be getting the keyboard dock for my birthday at the end of the month, so I can't yet comment to the increased battery life or anything as to the dock.\n\nI LOVE being able to adjust the perfomance level of the cpu and the brightness of the screen. For most situations I don't need the screen at full brightness and it's really convenient being able to turn it down (in bed at night I turn it down so as not to disturb my boyfriend). But on a road trip last weekend, I turned on the IPS+ and the display was very easy to see and read in direct sunlight.\n\nI have loved my Android cell phone for going on two years now (it has Froyo) and my only complaint had been the size of the screen. ICS is DEFINITELY a big improvement and a lot more user-friendly. This tablet really makes it very easy to take your digital life with you. In the Play Store I was able to log in and download all of the apps that I love on my phone (all of my app info was saved in the account). I rarely need my laptop anymore as this is a wonderful replacement. The only thing this can't do is play some of the AVI's and MPG files - but that is an Android issue and not this tablet. I use a program (not the one that comes on the tablet, but one I used previously) to remote into my work and home computers to access/download/transfer any files I need with no issues whatsoever.\n\nAs to the portability, it's very light and sleek in design. Every couple of months I go to day-long auctions where, in the past, I was always carrying around my boyfriend's HP Touch Pad. By the end of the day, my arms would be killing me. I used this at the one we went to last weekend with no trouble or discomfort whatsoever.\n\nAll in all, I'm very happy with my purchase. I didn't order it through Amazon becuase, at the time, shipping Prime was going to take a few days (including a weekend in between!), so I went with TigerDirect and got it next day for a small delivery fee. I didn't have any of the \"raised screen\" or \"light bleed\" issues that have been mentioned in reviews in the past. Maybe I was lucky, but from what I've seen in the past, I think most \"happy customers\" just don't take the time to review items. The unhappy ones are usually more than happy to tell the whole world about their \"bad experience\". I would recommend this tablet (and have done so already) to any and everybody."}

It is just brighter in the sun and still annoyingly reflective. I played temple run on both and found ipad2 less bright but otherwise snappier and clearer.\n2- the tablet kept dropping wifi out of the box. It took 2 hours and a call to asus to fix it. I came this close to sending it back.\n3- when wifi finally connected. It only connected at wireless g. It does not connect at n speeds. Additionally it only has a 2.4 ghz radio, no 5 ghz to be seen. For those less familiar, the wifi on this tablet is 2005 equipment. And this is unacceptable for a 600 bucks machine in 2012.\n4- the glass seems like it could separate anytime. The whole tablet feels flimsy and gives crackling sounds on gentle handling. It feels very cheap and fragile. Again unacceptable for a high end device.\n5- try pressing on a white screen and you end up with semi-permanent graying that lasts minutes. It seems air (and dust) can easily get between glass and screen which could spell disaster long term. Ipad2 graying disappears in a second.\n6- browsing experience is average. Chrome is better than on ipad but not nearly as fast as it ought to be. This is not saying much though because chrome on ipad is very slow on its own merits. The letters appear sharper though. Big wop.\n7- goes without saying, it is much harder to find quality tablet apps for android than it is on ipad. Even if you are willing to pay top dollar for them. Part of the problem is the play store which does not aid the discovery process.\n8- tablet is a smudge magnet, front and back. Again in high end tablet i expected surface treatment with lipophobic material to keep the screen visible.\n\nI only had the device for 24 hours at the time of writing and i will update as i gain more experience. But so far, if this is your first tablet purchase, buy a freakin ipad. You would be much better off. Zero frustration, and 100% enjoyment. Android tablets are easily 5 years behind current ipad.\n\nUpdate 08/10/2012: 9- Performance is quirky. The graphical user interface has quit on me 3 times so far in light use. Suddenly and for no apparent reason at all, I am left with an empty frozen screen that only shows the wallpaper. I am forced each time to use the physical power button to reboot tablet. I have a total of 25 installed apps only, most of which came pre installed. In 2 years of iPad use I never had to do that, never.\n\nNote: all the 5 star reviews you are seeing come from android fan boys who have been using really crappy tablets and see this one as a great upgrade. Everything is relative in this life. If you live in a tiny dorm room with a roommate for 4 years, you will think that a one bedroom apartment is buckingham palace.\n\nUpdate 08/12/12: 10- the tablet heats up pretty quickly. after about 30 minutes of continuous use the left upper quadrant becomes noticably hot. i am operating at a controlled temperature that does not exceed 75 f.\n11- battery life is iffy. it simply does not last all day. you have to recharge it in the afternoon on moderate use. on heavy use, like playing advanced games with high graphics demands, battery life is about 4 hours. the 9 hour theoretical claim is based on playing video which is a relatively battery friendly activity.\n12- Sound is awful. the one speaker can easily be blocked by your hand, and even if you are careful, it is still very low, thin and bland. no distinction between bass and any other levels. you literally have to put your ear to the speaker to hear. in fairness, all tablets (and smartphones) I have used have bad sound. a supplemental bluetooth speaker is mandatory.\n\nNote: i checked out asus facebook page. every entry they have is followed by hundreds of irate comments from dissatisfied customers. oddly asus reps never comment back despite the fact that many comments are specific.\n\nNote: I am disappointed with the tech blogs who touted this tablet as the perfect device, conveniently ignoring any of the above quirks and defects. the disappointment includes anandtech, the verge, engadget and hothardware.\n\nUpdate 08/25/12:\n13- Scrolling is hard and choppy and unresponsive. I can't believe it is a processor issue with such a powerful 4+1 processor. it must be a OS issue because it is the same problem in most apps but not all apps I have used. Maybe android 4.1 will solve the problem.\n14- links: clicking on links is a surprise every time. sometimes it just works and sometimes it is completely unresponsive that you got to click several times. And it is always embarrassingly laggy.\n15- Widgets: android has a wealth of beautiful and functional widgets to choose from. Trouble is, many of these widgets freeze, go blank or just don't update as expected. This seems a system wide yet random problem. On any given day you just don't know which widget is going to work.\n\nNote: tablet wide freezing problem follow up. the problem is getting worse. I frequently end up with nothing but the background wallpaper (at least once a day). Ironically apps would still work but only from the recent apps button since the main screen is blank. So this is gui issue which speaks volumes about the lack of attention given by developers to the user facing components of the OS.\n\nNote: for those who have come to expect airplay from their tablets, there is a partial workaround. If you have any Google tv device and install the free \"able remote\" application on both tablet and Google tv, then you can stream music, YouTube and other videos to your tv. This is not mirroring but it solves most of the problem. Basically you start your video and choose able remote from the share menu.\n\nNote: someone might ask, but why have I not returned this machine yet and gotten my money back. well, I should have except I need a larger form factor android device to try apps I am working on. Besides android tablets aren't getting any better in the near future. So it is not like I have better alternatives at this screen size."}

As soon as It's appeared on Amazon I bought it.\nI'm very disappointed: the tablet has very poor quality. It freezes all the time, has dark and white spots on borders of the screen, sometimes black and white artifacts appear. This tablet was supposed to be an iPad killer or at least has the same level of quality and amount of features. I'm not a picky person but It doesn't even fit my requirements of products quality. Just look at LCD test [...] - the gradient is ugly. Just compare it with iPad for the same price. The new iPad has smooth gradient representation. This Asus tablet was designed to have the same screen quality as iPad but they didn't even get it. Luckily Amazon has great return policy so I sent the tablet back within a day after I noticed all defects."}

I'm almost embarrassed to admit I had to go through two other tablets to get one that, so far, seems to be working right.  The first two tablets had some serious screen issues, ones that no reviewer or forum touched on, the first would have a blue screen flash on the screen then the picture would start twitching uncontrollably.  The second tablet I got had some serious screen flickering like the old TV's just before they went bad.  I would like to mention that both of the tablets had the 'crunching' sound on the screen so I'm not sure if that had anything to do with it.  The last tablet I got seems to have a much better screen, there is no 'crunching' and the build seems solid.  You would think after having such a hard time I would give it a lower rating but this tablet is great.  It's responsive, it looks cool, it's fast, it has an optional keyboard dock (which I'm using now to type this review) and it has the potential to replace my laptop (I'll have to use this more before I can go that far).  I would recommend this tablet, but if what I have been reading is true the TF300 is just as good but without the HD display and Gorilla glass and a slightly slower CPU.  I hope I don't run into more screen (or other issues) with this tablet, it's my first time buying an Asus product and though initially I was disappointed I hope to get a better experience with my third tablet.\n\n**************updated 10/7/2012 previously a 4 star review******************\n\nSo here I am with tablet #3 and my screen is going AGAIN, it's flickering and I'm sure it's only a matter of time before the screen goes bad like my previous two.  Unfortuantely for me, I'm well past the 30 day return period so I had to go through Asus support and will be sending my unit in for repair.  I don't think that a piece of equiptment that costs $500 should be giving this many problems and I can't recommend anyone buy this tablet (at least not sight unseen and being able to test the edges for the crunching clicking sound) though it is great in most other regards why would you want to deal with such a hassel.  It really is unfortunate and i'm not sure if I'm just very unlucky, but something tells me this is not a 'just me' problem.  This has been my first experience with an Asus product and will probably be my last."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "There are only a few minor flaws that keep this tablet from being perfect, but I'll get to those problems in a minute.\n\nI've previously owned a Motorola Xoom and a Samsung Tab 8.9, and the Infinity is far and away the best tablet out of the three.\nThe screen on the Infinity is gorgeous...almost comparable to the recent Retina Display iPad. But you'd have to have hold the two devices side by side\nto even notice the difference. And compared to other android tablet screens, there is no contest so far.\n\nSpeed is incredible...going in and out of apps are snappy with little to no lag.\n\nNow for the bad stuff.\n\nBattery life: I've been averaging about 7 hours of battery life with moderate usage such as watching Netflix or movies at the balanced settings. Considering this beast has quad core processors and a high count of pixels, this should be no surprise. But don't expect 10+ hours of battery life as one would expect\nfrom an iPad. The flipside, however, is that it takes less than 3 hours to fully charge from 0%-100%.\n\nSpeakers. Not loud enough for me. I compared my Samsung Tab 8.9 and the Infinity side by side and the speakers of my Samsung Tab was noticeably louder than the Infinity. This was a disappointment.\n\nA note to Infinity users who may be having problems with their navigation in the Netflix App: Go into settings, select \"Developers Options\" and then check off force gpu rendering, it will fix the Netflix problem. Thanks to Pan for that suggestion.\n-------------------------\nUpdate on the speakers: Someone suggested that I install an app called Omega Centauri Booster in order to increase the volume of the speakers and I have to say that it worked. My estimation is that the app augmented the sound by about 30-40%. It doesn't sound like much but it made quite a difference to the point where I no longer had to wear my earphones on most movies that I watched."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I had previously owned an ASUS TF300 which unfortunately developed a fault and was refunded via a Squaretrade warranty. I had deliberated for a few weeks over whether to buy another ASUS product or an alternative brand Android tablet. Eventually I decided to buy the TF700 Infinity, primarily because there was very little else on the market that came close to the specification of the TF700 and I was impatient to get another tablet as I really loved using my TF300. Overall, I am delighted with the TF700, it is a truly wonderful tablet. I've been using it daily for over ten days now so thought that was long enough to give my thoughts.\n\nThe new full HD Super IPS+ screen offers a fantastic resolution and brightness. While it is true that few Android apps support such a high resolution directly at the time of writing, uses such as the Kindle app and general web browsing look incredible and it is impossible to see any pixelation at all in text and hi-res photos. It really is a joy to behold. However, the primary reason I'm not giving this tablet five stars is also because of the screen - the bottom of my screen suffers from relatively minor light bleed in about four or five places an inch apart from each other and the left edge has two patches on the edge which are darker than the rest of the screen. I can live with this - it's certainly a common problem with tablet screens, (and desktop LCD/LED monitors/TV for that matter.)\n\nHaving upgraded from a TF300 I was a little disappointed some of my previously bought apps didn't work on the TF700. Most notably, Tiger Woods 12 is listed in the Google Play store as incompatible with the TF700. That's a shame as it was one of the games I loved on my TF300 and I hope EA eventually get round to fixing their code to work on the Infinity and other newer tablets. It's worth saying that most of the apps I'd already previously bought for my TF300 worked fine on the TF700 though - at a rough guess out of over forty (non-Google) apps, only two or three refused to install, or installed then crashed upon running. Of course, all the Google apps work perfectly.\n\nBefore I bought the TF700, I was a little concerned as to whether the 1.6ghz Tegra 3 would be quick enough to drive the 1920*1200 resolution in 3D games and the like. I needn't have worried - every compatible game I've played on the TF700 works wonderfully. System intensive games such as Riptide GP work great even when upscaled with no noticeable drop in frame-rate, (if there is a drop in frame-rate, I don't notice it.)\n\nIf I was to pick fault with the tablet, I'd have to say the most disappointing thing is the speaker and its positioning. Being placed on the back, the sound is already directed away from the user and sounds feebler than tablets with front mounted speakers, but when used in a case, (folded open), or when the tablet is laid flat on a desk, the sound is obviously further muffled. It's still audible when used at home, but harder to hear properly when outside or somewhere with ambient background noise. This is nitpicking though - and something that using headphones obviously solves!\n\nAndroid 4 Ice Cream Sandwich is a joy to use. That said I am looking forward to the 4.1 Jellybean upgrade when it becomes available after having used it on my wife's Nexus 7. I'm in no particular hurry though as ICS is very stable and well featured. (EDIT 13th October 2012 -- I received the 4.1 Jellybean update wirelessly from ASUS over a week ago and absolutely love it! The upgrade install and setup without any issues and was a very nice surprise.)\n\nOne thing I was particularly interested in using this tablet for was video calls and plain voice calls using Skype as I have a lot of family in Europe. The Skype app works perfectly - the audio sounds perfectly clear and the video streams without any hiccups.\n\nCompared to the TF300, the TF700 appears to be better constructed and solid. The majority of the back of the unit is metal rather than plastic and the unit feels much more sturdier than the previous model. The inclusion of Corning Gorilla Glass is very welcome too compared to whatever the screen covering was on the TF300.\n\nIf you are looking for a high specification tablet, I would definitely advise you to consider this product. It's great - not perfect, but certainly much closer than any other Android tablet currently available at this price point."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I've had the TF700 long enough to give it a thorough workout and it's a great tablet except for two things that really annoy me after paying $500.\n\nIt has really poor battery life and trying to get six hours in balanced mode is a struggle unless I turn the screen brightness way down, turn off wifi when not in use, keep GPS and bluetooth turned off all the time, and try not to have more than one app running. In power savings mode, using the same battery saving steps, the best I've gotten is 7:31 with 4% remaining on the battery.\n\nThe second annoying \"feature\" is the display auto-dim. The screen will automatically darken and lighten to save power (in balanced and power save modes) and it causes an annoying flicker as it does this every second or two, depending on how often what's on the screen changes. At times, it won't dim at all (a game for example), but while web browsing, it does it all the time.\n\nI really like this tablet and don't have any other complaints, but it has two well-known defects that aren't getting fixed by Asus. It isn't of much use to me when I have to spend time thinking about closing apps or turning off wifi to gain a couple of extra minutes. I'm already using it with the screen much darker than I prefer.\n\nI'm sure many will say that my complaints are sour grapes, but if you check around, you'll see that they're\nnot.\n\n*** UPDATE***\nAsus tech support wasn't able to help with the screen flickering or the poor battery life. I checked a TF700 at a local dealer and their display model also flickered so the problem isn't limited to my specific tablet. The flicker is easily seen when selecting different wallpapers--especially the lighter colored ones. I checked a TF300 at the same time and its screen didn't flicker with the same wallpapers."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "Pros: I only just got it, but there is not much to learn about the Infinity beyond first impressions if you already familiar with ICS.\n\n1. The display is crisp, beautiful, high resolution. It is absolutely the selling factor, and it is spot on. 2. The tablet is very thin, which is either a plus or minus -it is borderline \"too\" thin. 3. Doesn't come with much bloatware. 4. Rear camera is average. You don't buy a tablet like this to take photos though. 5. The plastic strip is great for reception, I can get ~60 yards on an old Westell router through walls. 6. Snappy with a great processor. 7. DDR3 is noticable. Applications never hang, any snags are due to network blocking. 8. LCD glass is solid, and seems durable. Would rather not put that to much of a test. 9. Got ~5 hours of hd video playback the day of purchase after trying a full charge with super IPS brightness. Which is really solid. 10. Text is CRISP. The built in book reader is mediocre, so get an app\n\nCons: 1. Obviously it is expensive, but that is mostly the cost of R&D in the new display tech. 2. It could have hit a full hdmi instead of micro. 3. It could have fit full sd instead of micro. 4. The volume bar can be somewhat flimsy. 5. The inability to swap the battery sucks, especially when it has crummy battery life due to the display + processor. 6. Still wish it just came with the dock - $125 for a keyboard / battery is really overpriced. 7. Lack of usb connectivity without the dock. 8. The bootloader is locked, while I expect someone will figure out a way to root this thing, it seems silly to spend the effort to make this tablet hard to crack when it appeals so much to enthusiasts. 9. Mainly because of #8, the delay for 4.1 sucks since the Nexus 7 is already out.\n\nOther Thoughts: 10 pros and cons. This tablet is for someone who wants a premium product, and it is an excellent book reader, movie viewer, game device, and with the dock it is a solid ultra portable. You want this over the Nexus 7 if you want more screen space at the same DPI, with the hdmi connectivity and docking ability to turn it into a netbook. 4.0 / 4.1 Android are defintely strong enough to play productivity device. I look forward to developing some neat apps on this thing for the upcoming high resolution market, because display resolution will be going up fast and soon - getting on board early is just a nicety."}

This is my first tablet PC and I have  and watch for the technology to finally mature. The responsiveness is awesome. It combines the best of touch screen technology with a docking station keyboard.  I can disconnect the keyboard for a purely tablet / kindle type of experience.  When I am sitting in my lounge chair have the keyboard attached and its like a small laptop.  In bed at night, (yes, I take it to bed with me) I can use the tablet section, and the device automatically activates the onscreen keyboard. This is great in the dark because you can see the keyboard on the screen.  I am using my Infinity to write this review. I have had computers and laptops for the last 20 years.  This technology totally rocks.\n\nUpdate 07-28-2015 - I have now had this device for just over 3 years.  Here are my view of this product today. So, I have used this device very heavily for the last 3 years. It is still going strong.  I updated the Android OS to 4.2.1 about 1 year ago.  This device is a work horse for me and strong as a mule.  I have dropped it several times, one drop very severe and landed on a corner. The device is dented, scratched, bent is some places, but still working like a charm.  I use this device for audible files, for streaming movies for travel, email and everything you normally use a table for.\n\nThe only complaint that I have is after about 1.5 years the keyboard attachment wore out. The latch would not hook anymore. This occurred as a result of connecting and disconnecting the keyboard. I solved the problem by permanently connecting the keyboard using shipping tape. I  have not had the performance issues that other complain about.  I am going to have to retire this unit at some point. But not to the heap scrap, I am going to use it as a smart device for my TV. It still works perfectly, just beat up quit a bit."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I was a little hesitant to get this tablet after reading about build quality issues and other problems. Since I wanted a tablet to take on vacation I went ahead and got this as well as the keyboard.\n\nAs I am new to tablets and very new to Android it's taken a few days of immersion to become proficient and to attain my swagger regarding navigating around and understanding the do's and don'ts of Android. The short story is that I am very pleased with the build quality and overall performance of the tablet and I think I've become an Android convert.\n\nThe only \"CON\" that I have is that the speaker/audio really, really stinks. I wasn't expecting too much but after reading the hype on the ASUS site about the level-of-effort that went into the audio component I am very disappointed. For those that recall it kind of sounds like a transistor radio. My little iPod blows it away (and that's not saying much) so I won't believe any argument justifying the sound based on technology limitations. I do plan on using ear buds most of the time and those sound acceptable but ... for times when I want to watch a move with someone else watching I got a mini sound bar that plugs into the headphone jack (which comes with a USB battery pack so I'm not tethered to a wall socket all the time).\n\nI did purchase some apps to replace a few of the bare bones default ASUS apps and have been thrilled for the most part. These would be an iTunes synchronizer (works awesome), an audio player and a movie player. In addition I added the obligatory anti-virus app.\n\nI definitely could survive without the keyboard but I love the fact that it has its own battery that also drives the tablet (greatly extending the time between charges). Eventually the keyboard's full size SD slot and USB (2.0) port should come in handy as well.\n\nThis tablet would be 5 stars in my book if it were not for the poor speaker/audio."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I have owned a Xoom for over a year and I must say the screen on the Infinity is outstanding. Yes it does get bright enough to view outside. The resolution is good and the build quality is good as well, it has a solid feel. I ran Jelly Bean on my Xoom and I have to say the Xoom with Jelly Bean was a little faster. I can hardly wait for Jelly Bean on the Infinity, it should smoke the Xoom in speed. Battery life is good as long as you don't leave the screen on the brightest setting. The infinity is very lite and the quiality is good, the camera is very good for a tablet and it has an ample flash, but it needs an action setting like the Xoom had (Jelly Bean again). The time lapse is fun and the 1080P video quality is very good. The only camera problem I have noticed is the backlighting on the camera, some tweaks are needed. To those that have had a problem with slow transfer from the external sd card, they need to format it FATex and your problems will be gone. Finally after much searching and returning a case that doesn't fit I purchased a Poetic case and it fit very nicely after a little tweaking. would I buy it again? Yes"}

Still love the screen resolution.\n\nOne other annoying thing that is just inexcusable...  It will not charge unless it is plugged into it's own power adapter.  I have multiple USB devices and I travel.  I bought a 4 usb wall adapter so that I don't have to carry a bunch of these bulky blocks for all my devices.  Try finding a power outlet in an airline club room - let alone 2 or 3.  The ASUS will not charge while plugged into this adapter.  My Samsung phone, Nikon camera, wifes iphone, wifes ipad all work fine, but not the ASUS.  Because I travel, I also have a backup power supply.  The \"PowerGen Mobile Juice Pack\".  I have  this for international flights for backup power.  It will power my Samsung phone, Nikon camera, wifes iphone and wifes ipad, but NOT the ASUS.  I've since looked at other adapters and external power charges and NONE of them work with ASUS.  There is no acceptable excuse for this.\n\nUpdate 2 - After 11 months\nLatest update changed quite a bit on my tablet.  Still would like to be able to opt out of updates.\nStill can't find a usb ac adapter or external battery pack that works with this tablet.  Still not good for long international flights.\n\nUpdate 3 - Over a year\nThe last update that I was forced to take, changed the color of my keyboard and a few other minor things.  The worst thing, is now it's slow.  If you go to google, the typing is annoying.  It delays 2 or 3 seconds between letters.  Overall, the webpages load slower now.  Everything related to the internet is worse - mostly just slow and delayed.\n\nThis started out as a great tablet, but Asus updates just keep taking away the quality.\n\nPRO:\nScreen is very nice.\nMovies look great when they play.\nThe tablet is fast and smooth to use.\nNot loaded with bloatware.\nSurfing the web is fast and reliable.  FYI - set the user agent to desktop, not mobile.  Mobile websites look bad on a screen this size, plus many websites like Amazon won't even load on mobile mode, it will error with \"too many redirects\".\nBattery life is pretty good.  I generally charge it once or twice a week.\n\nCON:\nUpdates from Asus hose up something everytime.  Latest one made it slow.\nreboots too often\nYoutube app and browser does not handle poor or slow wi-fi very well, compared to laptop.\nFirmware updates often and may make it more unstable.\nOnly charges with it's own power adapter."}

More often it tells me that the browser is not responding. It is annoying!\nBut it is not a deal breaker.\n\nI have the Amazon Prime subscription so one of the perks is getting unlimited streaming. At first I was disappointed when browsing for device supported because it didn't list this device. But I tried it anyway by clicking one of the chick flicks (Ha! What did you expect me to watch?) and it works!! Amazing! Plugged it to my speakers and viola... No issues with streaming.\n\nAnother thing that I really really like about this tablet, and compared to my iPad, is the SD slot on the dock and the micro SD on the tablet itself. I like transferring files from my computer to the SD rather than through plugging in the tablet straight to the computer, just my preference. The ability to do that, is one of the things that got me to decide to pick this one.\n\nLastly, I like the spell check. While typing this review, I was seeing a few words underscored in red. You can add the words that you typed or select one of the suggested words..... Pretty neat!\n\n***************************\n\nI purchased this yesterday at Amazon together with the Transformer Infinity Dock (which by the way I highly recommend) and got it delivered this morning.\n\nI'm not new to the tablet world itself as I have owned a couple of them (including the iPad) but this is quiet a refreshing tablet. Not only the display is amazingly clear, it was easy enough for me to get used to the UI of this mobile device.\n\nSince most of the reviewers here have pretty much went into detail about their experience, I'm not going to take that route :)\n\nWhat I like about this set up (with the dock), it looks like you are using a netbook instead of a tablet with keyboard. Like the iPad, when I used it with Zaggmate, it didn't really go together as a whole. With the Asus dock, it looks whole and complete. In addition to that, it also extends your battery life per charge.\n\nI read somewhere here where one reviewer wished it was white or came in white. Not me. I have the Asus Eee netbook in white and though they are really pretty to look at, practically, with fingers going everywhere to places not seen or heard, you'd get your device dirty real quick.\n\nI have not really played with this thoroughly as some of the apps that I have on my Galaxy S II are not yet supported on this device. Disappointed that Pageonce Pro hasn't updated their apps (but that is a different story hehehe).\n\nWould I recommend this device to anybody? Definitely!\n\nIf you are looking to get a great device and do not want to pay for those that are quiet overpriced.... then this is the best option out there currently.\n\nIf you can spare a hundred dollars and change, then get the dock (keyboard) -- makes it all worth it."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "My wife bought the ASUS Transformer Infinity for my birthday.  I opened it tonight and it was dented next to the left dock latch point.  This caused the glass to bow out in this part of the screen.  The packaging was fine and the box was perfect so I think this happened during manufacture but shipped from ASUS anyway.  I'd read about some quality issues from ASUS and bad support but figured that was a small percentage of customers with a big voice.  Now I'm not so sure.  It shipped from Circuit City (via Amazon order) and looks like we'll be paying for shipping back to CC as well.  You may want to buy local so you can take it back if you have quality issues too.\n\nUPDATE:\nI received my second TF700.  This unit doesn't have a dented frame but the glass is separated just as bad (in about the same location).  I can pinch the unit and the glass bends back into place and bows back out when I let go (it doesn't creak like some do).  Gregg, I turned this unit on and it has very bad light bleed (especially where the glass is separated).  Check out the pictures I'll include in the 32G TF700 item photos.  Forums say both of these are common problems.  This one shipped from Amazon rather than CC.  I don't want to hassle with returning the new mobile dock, micro SD card and 3 cases my wife bought me so I'll keep this unit.  Based on my experiences, ASUS is not capable of shipping a tablet with build quality to match other tablet/pad manufacturers.  Again, if you want a unit with decent fit/finish, buy at a brick and mortar store and open it before you leave.\n\nUPDATE2:\nToday (9/14 - a month and a day after taking delivery) I noticed the glass is separating on the right side of the screen too and makes a popping sound when I pinch and let go of it there.  I also hate where they put the headphone jack because it's on the lower left corner (right where you hold the tablet).  I can't patch this flaw with either of my Bluetooth devices because video lags audio from the TF700 over Bluetooth only.  Both devices work perfectly with my phone and PC.  I also, can't copy files to the TF700's microSD card because it freezes and reboots itself every time (after the update that should have fixed this).  Again, these are all common problems when I visit forums."}

The iPad was out because of the closed ecosystem, and I have already paid for android apps on my phone that will scale up well once installed on the tablet. The Nexus 7 was almost a no brainer for me, it has a great price, quad-core processor, amazing screen and great software support from Google except for the lack of\n\n1. MicroSD expandability (gameloft games on average take up at least 2 gigs of internal memory)\n2. HDMI-out (with apps like Netflix, Hulu plus, and HBO go not to mention flash support, being able to output that to a TV screen is a huge plus)\n\nFor about twice as much as the Nexus 7, the Infinity offers a higher resolution screen that's also brighter powered by a top of the line quad core processor. It also includes a microSD slot, 8 mp camera, microHDMI out and the ability to expand via a mobile docking station that adds additional battery life, full sized USB OTG support and a SD slot. I have to say that all the additional features are worth the extra premium. I don't have to worry about storage space and the tablet functions much like a laptop replacement for me. If you're on the fence between the two, I'd say go for the Infinity."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "So I read all the expert reviews, and I have to agree that this is the best android device I've used. it's my first tablet (have android phone), but I am impressed with what it had out of the box wrt apps, and there is abrely any lag at all! This is by no means an expert review but a quick summary of my user experience after 24 hrs\n\nPros\n- GREAT display - watching videos or browsing the web or pics is a pleasure on this (and I can use flash still!)\n- very fast performance with little to no lag in switching apps 9with up to 6 or 7 multitasking)\n- apps all behave smoothly\n- light weight, even with the dock\n- great battery life esp with the dock basically charging your tablet!\n- camera is good (though I haven't really tested it)\n- convenient flexibility - I've been able to use microSDHC cards, SD cards, USB flash drives (via the dock) and this has allowed me to sideload content far easier than any syncing!\n\nCons\n\n- none so far except maybe the dearth of apps.

Personally I don't expect a device this small to have great sound anyway, but it is a bit muffled and just about acceptable volume for you an another few persons close by, but don't plan to sue this for any talks!

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "So, this being my fourth Android device in a little over two years and having relatively high expectations given the mostly glowing reviews here, I was definitely looking forward to receiving this new tablet.\n\nHowever, having used an HTC Flyer for nearly a year (that was ruined by the incompatible Honeycomb \"upgrade\"), I find it annoying having a speaker only on the right side of the ASUS TF700T.  Unless you put the tablet into portrait position or hold your hand on the right side in landscape to deflect the sound more to the middle, it sounds like the (non-existent) left speaker is broken.  I don't usually listen to my music with the left channel shut off or with only the right ear bud in my right ear, so this is especially frustrating on this tablet model given that the screen itself is quite nice visually.  If I do return it, it will probably be due to the inexplicably poor speaker placement, limited volume output, and less than stellar audio quality even with expensive headphones and equalizer apps.  At this price point (I bought the 64GB), as an audiophile and music lover, I am not satisfied with the disappointing sound features.  The overall build quality is also taken down a couple notches by the cheap feeling plastic volume and power buttons, and the proprietary and flimsy power adapter connector (no direct USB without the dock??).  Yes, the full HD screen is really nice, especially for viewing high resolution photos, but the other downsides may be a deal breaker.\n\nEven my old HTC Flyer has the stereo speakers in the center, but with enough of a raise in the rear profile of the case so that the sound is nearly evenly distributed in landscape mode even when lying flat.  While I do have the nice Bose portable bluetooth speaker, it's not practical to carry it around everywhere all the time to compensate for the TF700T's lousy sound.  What was ASUS thinking?\n\nI've read the XDA discussion about this tablet's DAC, so I'm not the only one who hoped for more from this tablet.  It would be nice to know if there is a better Android tablet choice available in terms of sound quality that still has a decent display, whether 7\" or 10\".\n\nFile this one in the \"so very close but so very far\" category.  How this can arguably be the best Android tablet on the market for this kind of money is just sad.\n\n*** UPDATE - 08/04/12 - Item returned due mainly to poor quality sound design.  Will wait until something better is released for this kind of crazy money for a tablet.  Manufacturers are you listening?  Please, offer a device with a good DAC and decent stereo speakers with this kind of a gorgeous display and I and others will gladly buy it."}

Why? I'm writing a novel, and needed to be able to create portions of the narrative on a tablet with a keyboard. I am in an environment where I cannot risk my Macbook Pro while out and about, so I write snippets of my story on the Infinity and then transfer them back into the laptop later. For that purpose, the Infinity is excellent. It is also thinner, lighter and better designed than the Thrive. It is peppier, and Asus, unlike Toshiba, is excellent about releasing operating system updates. My only complaint about the unit is that the screen does not look good when displaying solid black - some of the corners are grayish instead. There are no dead pixels.\n\nWith the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Asus-Transformer-Infinity-TF700T-Mobile-Docking-Amethyst-Gray-TF700T-DOCK-GR/dp/B008FH1R0W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Asus Transformer Infinity TF700T Mobile Docking - Amethyst Gray (TF700T-DOCK-GR)</a>, this little tablet is a marvelous wonder of productivity enhancing excellence. I use it for writing, reading and music and it serves excellently for all three. I also use it as a white noise generator with this app:<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/White-Noise/dp/B007BFSYMS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">White Noise</a>. I've unlocked and rooted the tablet, which is relatively easy compared to some others on the market. May void your warranty - I am not responsible for anything that goes wrong.\n\nAmazon apparently doesn't want me linking to rooting and unlocking sites (they removed my links) so I'll give the following hints: Google \"unlock Transformer Infinity\" and you'll get a link to an .apk file on the Asus web site. To root the Infinity, Google [ROOT][TOOL]Debugfs automated root and you should find the top hit at XDA developers.\n\nIf you don't know what unlocking and rooting are, you should probably do some research before trying either, as you can end up with a very expensive paper weight if you are not careful. The apps Asus ships with the Infinity are mostly very useful. In particular, I found Polaris Office to be quite handy for opening Word and Excel documents and editing them from the tablet using the keyboard. I highly recommend the Apex Launcher app as well, as it is a bit more elegant than the stock ICS launcher.\n\nEDIT: A few other thoughts. I also purchased the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/ASUS-Transformer-Prime-TF201-B1-CG-10-1-Inch-32GB-Tablet-Champagne/dp/B0067PLNRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">ASUS Transformer Prime TF201-B1-CG 10.1-Inch 32GB Tablet (Champagne)</a>&nbsp;at the same time I purchased the Transformer Infinity. There are some minor design differences, but for all intents and purposes, the Prime is identical to the Infinity. The differences I noticed before I sold the Prime to a very happy buyer were that wireless range is slightly shorter on the Prime (there is a plastic antenna strip on the Infinity because the all metal case on the Prime caused wireless problems for some users). The screen on the Prime is lower resolution, but the picture actually looked identical to my eye. The Prime did not have the lighter areas in the corners - I believe this has to do with  the bonding process used to attach the LED screen to the Corning Gorilla Glass. The Infinity has a slightly tapered back. The keyboard docking station for the Prime and Infinity are interchangeable. If budget is a concern, there is no compelling reason to spend more for the Infinity, unless you are particularly concerned about the range of the Wifi. I got about 30% more range with the Infinity.\n\nEDIT 2: Here are the other items that I bought to go with the tablet:\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Asus-Transformer-Infinity-TF700T-Mobile-Docking-Amethyst-Gray-TF700T-DOCK-GR/dp/B008FH1R0W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Asus Transformer Infinity TF700T Mobile Docking - Amethyst Gray (TF700T-DOCK-GR)</a>\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Poetic-Asus-Transformer-Pad-Infinity-TF700-Leather-Keyboard-Portfolio-Stand-Case-Cover-for-TF700-Brown/dp/B008LM04YQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Poetic Asus Transformer Pad Infinity TF700 Leather Keyboard Portfolio Stand Case Cover for TF700 Brown</a>\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/SanDisk-32GB-microSDHC-Memory-Card-Bulk-Package/dp/B003WGJYCY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">SanDisk 32GB microSDHC Memory Card (Bulk Package)</a>\n\nEDIT 3: The Infinity tablet and docking station/keyboard comes in two color schemes. Champagne is actually sort of silvery-yellow, and is sometimes described as gold. Gray is actually slightly purplish and dark. Neither color description reminds me of the actual tablet/keyboard color. Make sure you match them up if you are buying both parts, and remember - champagne is light and gray is dark. Some vendors do not describe the colors accurately, so make sure you know which you are getting if color matters to you.\n\nDocking station/keyboard review is here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R6UTZZWNHAG7Q/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I ordered this the day it became available and Amazon shipped two days later. I am writing this review after using my tablet for two weeks. This is a great tablet.  The brightness level lets you read outside in almost direct sunlight, although the glass is a bit too reflective and shiny when outside.  Indoors is no problem.  The TF700 finds and locks onto WiFi connections with ease and the GPS locks onto multiple satellites quickly even indoors. The tablet is fast and the only lagging I have found was due to the software I used to borrow books from my local library. The touch screen is very responsive.  The battery drains a bit fast when on-line or playing games (though much more slowly than my wife's Kindle Fire) but lasts at least nine hours when offline. It charges quickly.  The tablet is light and easy to hold and it looks good. The high resolution display is fantastic. I noticed the only time the case became hot was when I was charging and surfing the web simultaneously.  If you do one or the other, the tablet stays cool. A number of useful apps and widgets are included. Internal storage is 32GB and you can add another 32GB micro SD card.  I use my card for backups.  You also get Asus cloud storage and can connect a USB flash drive or connect to an external PC through the dock/power supply connector (cable included).  The manual included with the tablet is sparse and basically useless, but you can download the full manual from Asus Support and, while not perfect, it provides much more information, especially for the included apps.\n\nThis is my first exposure to Android (and my first tablet) and I have found ICS to be intuitive and easy to use.  We all know that the Android app store is small in comparison with Apple, but I found all of the apps I wanted at the Google Play Store and Tablified Market.  The selection may be small, but you probably can find what you want there.\n\nMy only complaints are trivial: - the small plastic connector cover for the dock/power connector falls off easily and the screen is a fingerprint magnet (Asus includes a cleaning cloth).  Using a stylus helps.\n\nI choose the Asus over an iPad for several reasons, including (for the TF700): 32 GB on board storage, DDR3 RAM, a fast clocked Tegra 3, SD card slot, USB port (inexpensive USB f/f adaptor needed for some interfaces), Adobe Flash, cool operating temperature, and screen customization capability with ICS, all at a lower cost than a 32GB iPad without these features.  I did a side to side visual comparison with the iPad retina display and the TF700 and honestly could not see any difference.\n\nIf you want a fast, well executed tablet I highly recommend considering the TF700 before you make your decision."}

Battery lasted about 7 hrs and 20 mins (for the first week). Heat is not as hot compared to a laptop. There are plenty of free apps to use. After a firmware update, I noticed a slight improvement in app response. It has an external microSD slot and 8 mp back facing camera. I enjoy the keyboard swipe feature.\n\nCons: Too many open browsers tabs will slow down responses. I've had the occasional freezing/crashing/lagging/random shutdown and muted sound while using it. The touch screen sensitivity can be too sensitive or have no/delayed response. Videoclips can take long too load. Playing games may cause the back of the top left corner to heat up uncomfortably. The edges of the Gorilla corning glass is not glued down properly, so it will creak when pressed down. The battery life has sharply decreased down to just 4 hrs and 10 mins (even though I have the power saving mode and auto brightness on).\n\nOther thoughts: I take great care with my electronic toys, so maybe I got a defective ASUS product... Perhaps getting a stylus will improve the touch sensitivity. I may wait for further firmware updates and Jellybean To determine the value of this product.

Great quality camera, not a single issue. 1080p recordings are beautiful. I use 720p mostly since is a lecture. Also, it doesnt get too hot, not even gaming, very important\n\nHighly recommended."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I'd been waiting for this tablet to come out for several months, and am not the least bit disappointed. I had a few issues with the micro SD card, but they have already been solved with a new firmware release. If you're looking for a powerful Android tablet this is a great pick, and the optional keyboard dock is really appreciated by my wife who hates typing on virtual keyboards (I don't mind them, but hate losing the screen real estate). This will serve as an excellent laptop replacement for me on shorter trips."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I really like the tablet and haven't had any of the build quality issues mentioned in other reviews.  It feels solidly built and the performance has been fantastic.  That being said I am having 2 issues.  The first is that some apps are not working properly or at all on the tablet (WWF & DirecTV app for instance).  And the ASUS MyLibrary crashes, locks up, and rus slowly sometimes.  Also, hyperlinks in EPUB documents aren't functioning in MyLibrary.  I am working with ASUS on this and will provide updates on the outcome."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "So how many of us purchased the Prime in 2011 and then in January the Pad Infinity TF700T was introduced and suddenly the Prime looked less compared to this? Well I was one of them and decided to return that item for that reason and others as well. I returned the Prime because the 1280by800 resolution looked bad compared to the Pad's 1920by1200 monster resolution, the WiFi and the GPS had so many problems. I'll admit I could live w/o the GPS not functioning correctly but the WiFi needed to be fixed as there was no excuse for that not working 100%.\n\nHere 7 months later we have the Pad Infinity. Full HD screen with super IPS+ mode, fastest quad core processor available right now, 1GB of DDR3 ram, and a slim design that rivals the iPad's. So is this the best Android Tablet on the market right now? In my opinion, yes it is. The Nexus 7 is the best 7inch tablet, and this is the best 10.1 inch one. Acer has their Full HD Android on the market right now, but that processor is clocked at 1.3GHZ and to be honest I have heard many people say that device is sluggish for a quad core device. Granted that does cost $50 less but for an extra $50 for the Infinity it is worth it. I am not going to get into the specifics of the Infinity as Amazon has them listed, but this device really sets the bar for Android Tablets. The screen is fantastic and when you see it in hand, you will be in awe. The slimness feels great in the hand and it is light like the Prime so that area is covered. The WiFi and GPS work 110%. Do not worry about that at all. MY unit does not have any light bleed like others have had, and yes the browser does crash from time to time, but that can be fixed with an update or Jellybean when that comes out. If you are looking for an Android Tablet to buy in 2012, than this is it. Do not hesitate. It is a fantastic device and is worth every penny."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I own both the a700 and the tf700t, having upgraded from two a500's (which I was happy with).  I have owned the a700 since June 16th and used it up until passing it on to my girlfriend last week.  I have owned the tf700t since the 20th of July.  These are my observations:  Both tablets have touch screen issues.  The tf700t seems to have improved after a recent update.  Both displays are beautiful, both have great viewing angles, however the Asus is brighter. I do not play high graphic games on either tablet, that said, the tf700t dissipates heat better (not that I am bothered or worried about the a700's heat).  In the sound department the advantage by far goes to the a700.  Two speakers, Dolby, and slightly better placement wins out.  Both tablets exhibit lag in the browser.  I would give build quality to the a700.  It just feels better to me.  It is slightly heavier but that does not bother me.  I don't use the camera or video on either tablet; on paper the Asus has the advantage.  The Acer has the better battery life.  The Acer also came with the micro to full-size USB adapter, I had to pay $17 for the Asus adapter.  I like that the a700 has a cover for the micro SD, the tf700t does not.  I like that the a700 does not use proprietary ports.  Charge port is of the micro USB variety, the tf700t's charging port is proprietary.\n\nOverall, I like the Acer a700 a little bit more than the Asus tf700t.  I have had no major issues with it.  I have had issues with the Asus tf700t.  Freezing, wifi connectivity (slow to connect), and the dreaded white screen off death.  Recent update did not fix those problems...happened to me before and after the update (except for White screen).  If only the Acer a700 had the higher clock speed and ddr3 RAM, it would be the better tablet for sure.  For now, I hope Asus gets on their horse and fix the issues with their tablet."}

The quality of the screen makes things like Google Earth an absolute dream to play with.  I do a lot of traveling, so the ability to just go to a city, look around and mark where I want to go is pretty nice.  Yes, I can do this on a computer, or my first edition Motorola Xoom, but the screen and speed of the processer flat out shines.  Its had some glitches with smoothness and so forth, but I've already gotten two updates from ASUS pushed to me.  For the most part this is as smooth as an Ipad (My Xoom never was).\n\nGames: I really never got into android games on my Xoom, but again, the quality of the screen and processing speed makes gaming fun, even compared to XBox 360 hooked up to a home theater. One complaint, I wasn't able to get any external controllers to work on this, which was apparently possible with previous Transformers.\n\nMovies/Pictures/Videos: This tablet true shines when playing media.  I have lots of high megapixel nature and travel pictures - this tablet allows you to see the quality of the shot.  Literally the images seem to jump off the screen.  I haven't used the camera yet, so no comment there.\n\nWifi: Works great, no problems, same with GPS and Bluetooth.\n\nCons:\nApps Unavailable: Many of the apps in the android store will not work with this.  I believe it has to do with pixel density, but for instance, I wanted to buy the NBC olympics app to see live events on my infinity.  I couldn't download that or even the score updater from NBC.  So expect many apps to flat out not be available for you.\n\nBattery: The battery seems to die quicker than advertised.  Not sure why, I haven't been playing around with it.\n\nSound: The sound is OK strength, but wonder why they put both speakers together.  If I was going to knock a star off, it would be for this reason.\n\nBottom line, there's not a lot to complain about."}

Resolution is high enough that you can hold the device in either orientation and still easily read text and navigate thru documents.\n\nLight weight enough so you can easily hold it for extended periods.  Balance is good so you can hold in either orientation with one hand easily.\n\nResponsive and powerful, able to chew thru the most complicated word, excel, and power point slides easily.  Plays Blu-ray movies at the original data rate.  Even plays my finished edited HD videos.\n\n64 gigs onboard is a big jump over the previous capacities.  Micro SD slot gives the ability to interchange data easily with other devices.\n\nUSB support has finally come of age.  Can use it to mount large NTFS external hard drives for easy file transfer.  Also supports mice and keyboards for easier editing and surfing.  I've read where it also supports Xbox and PS3 controllers.\n\nI've ran 6  hours on battery and still had 53% battery left and that was with using both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.\n\nThe bad:\n\nManufacturers, pay attention, we need real functional USB ports!  They don't have to be full size but putting them in a 40-pin connector and forcing us to hang cables and dongles off is asinine because they will get broken!  Need to move the charge cable to one of the other sides or the top so it doesn't interfere with charging and using the tablet.\n\nNeed either the USB dongle or the dock to use USB devices, should have been builtin.  If I wanted a dock, I would've bought a tablet.\n\nWe need a way to connect to USB devices and charge the device at the same time!\n\nIf the device is plugged in, and you hold it by one hand, you smear fingerprints over the camera.  It helps you to point when you use the camera where's it at, but you really need to offset this.  Same thing for why you charge or hook it to the computer, you have that flimsy cable dangling down just waiting to get broken.\n\nPrice!  Can get laptops that are more powerful, more storage, and can just do more.  They are not as easy to hold or as light.\n\nThe strange:\n\nWho is going to pull out a tablet this big in a social event and start taking pictures and video?\n\nAndroid doesn't allow mounting of network drives (that I've found).  Only one external drive can be mounted at the same time.  Both work if you root the device which can void your warranty.\n\nNo AES support?  Haven't found a way to support this newer and more secure wireless connection.  Wake up manufacturers, most equipment phased TKIP out and only support AES.\n\nHad problems on several computers and laptops running different versions of Windows and even some Linux.  Mounting the drive as a MTP will cause other external media to not be seen.  Something I've done?"}

I have read alot of reviews on most of the tablets out there and it always seemed that something seperated them from being great.  For example Acer's heat problems, Toshiba's light bleed, Samsung lack of a Tegra 3 processor.  Finally Asus put out the Ifinity prime that had the promise of having no wifi or gps issues and had a screen that rivaled that of the Ipad.  I pulled the trigger last week and have been using it for 5 days and on the 6th day took it back.  First off the screen is incredible but that is the only thing that seems to seperate it from other tablets out there.  The touch aspect seemed to be unresponsive at time and the web borwsing was surprisingly slow.  I updated the firmware and did a full reboot many times to see it helped but it did not.  I can not justify spedning 5 hundy for something that is just ok.  Maybe Asus will work out the kinks but for now I recommend going wiht something more affordable."}

Asus also does very little to alter the stock Android experience and adds just a few helpful changes like settings and control widgets in the notification panel. Because ASUS has done little to muck up the experience, Android flies on this tablet. Very quick and smooth transitions and easy app switching with little lag, even before the promised Jelly Bean upgrade.

After about an hour of this I decided to perform a factory reset and now the Wi-Fi radio finally turned on and I was able to finally connect to my home network. I began to install several apps and started to view Netflix video's, so far so good - WRONG. Wi-Fi radio turned off again and the only way to turn it back on was another factory reset. This happened 4 times in 2 days - totally unacceptable. When the Wi-Fi did work the tablet browser had a difficult time rendering web pages. Pages were slow to load, and text took too long to come into complete focus, scrolling up & down was painful. Page would stutter and have to reload content constantly.

Don't get me wrong, I TRULY believe that Asus has an edge on ALL other (non-apple) tablets! And they do make sexy and innovative products but they are not consistent in QC which is hurting them in the long run. I have owned most of every tablet out there at some point or another... (LOVE tablets) and I can tell you that the ONLY tablet that I ever received defective was from Asus, including the newest Nexus 7 that I currently own as well as an iPad 3 w/64gb & LTE and my phone which is the Galaxy Nexus,  It was the products from ASUS including my Nexus 7 which is also my (3rd) unit but it's finally flawless (IMO). They should have upped the ram by a gb ( NO QUESTIONS ASKED )! They put in superior hardware but leave out what needs to POWER that BEAUTIFUL screen!??? The latest Galaxy 3 (PHONE) has 2gb of ram....?? They skimped in the WRONG places and continue to lack in quality control and customer support that it forced me to keep my iPad 3 ( \"The NEW iPad\" )... I WANT widescreen but apple does not seem to want that but it sure STOMPS on this tablet in terms of benchmarks ( for the most part ) and YES it does lack that extra 1gb of Ram that it should have but yet still outperforms almost every tablet out.... I don't want Apple's closed ecosysyem but it does do the job nicely ( if jailbroken ) and that is where I stand... I do give ASUS credit by releasing an unlocked bootloader right off the bat (pretty much) which allows for custom roms and such but you must give up your warranty for that which is pretty worthless anyways so buy a squaretrade warranty and hack away!!  :) BTW.... I am NOT an Apple fanboy!! Asus just broke my heart cause I wanted to LOVE this tablet sooo much but even though the defects were not extreme, they are still defects! But I will definitely be keeping my Asus Nexus 7!! Good luck with your new tablets out there but I am holding off on this one... Charge an extra $50.00 and make your components work together BEAUTIFULLY as they should with these specs..."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "Ok, for starters, I'm not some blind fan-boy trying to boost the hype behind this thing. I'm more the type to tear it down if it wasn't worth every penny I paid for it. I have been using Android for several years and am very familiar with it's pros and cons.\n\nI have to say, honestly, I haven't touched my laptop or netbook and have barely used my phone (for anything other than calls) since I got my Infinity (and dock.) Truth be told, I'm using it to write this review.\n\nDisplay: The display on this thing is nothing short of beautiful. I've always loved the idea of watching movies on my back patio.  Unfortunately, it's been a headache-producing, eye-squinting nightmare on every tablet, computer, phone and portable DVD player I've owned...until now. I intentionally loaded it up with Resident Evil: Apocalypse (because of the many dark scenes in it) and headed for the back yard. After being thoroughly impressed with how well I could see the movie, I decided to walk around the yard with it, in the midday sun. Only then did I have to turn on IPS+ to see the darker scenes and it worked perfectly. This display renders colors very true (not over-saturated or washed out) and blacks and whites are BLACK and WHITE. Text is crisp far smaller than I'd ever be willing to spend any time reading.\n\nSpeed: I don't know what else to say but it's very VERY fast. I've loaded over 225 apps of many different varieties on it, so I'd say I've put it through its paces. Now, I'm not saying that you won't have a sluggish moment here or there. What I AM saying is that if you do, it's probably the app you're using that's to blame. A poorly written app can cause a plague of problems on any device. I have a couple of apps that I'm willing to forgive shortcomings for because of functionality they offer but I can say that their shortcomings aren't nearly as apparent on this tablet as they have been on any of my other Android devices.\n\nBattery: If I beat it REALLY hard, I can kill the battery (tablet only) in about 6 hours. My version of beating it really hard is multi-tab web browsing with Flash turned on, switching back and forth between several other apps, installing apps, downloading from my Box.net account, playing some games, using a remote desktop client, etc. All the while running either native movies or YouTube streams in Stick It Player (resize-able, floating, video player window that renders on top of whatever app you have open.) If I use it like most people would normally use a tablet, I can easily break the 10 hour mark (tablet only.) With the dock (I'm using the Prime dock,) I get anywhere between 9 and 16 hours of use out of it.\n\nDock: I'm using a Transformer Prime TF201 dock because A) It has a bigger battery than the Infinity dock and B) it was about $50 cheaper than the Infinity dock. It works perfectly. All of the ports, the keys, the charging, etc. work exactly as they should. One thing is, it's a little bit tighter of a fit but all that really means is that there's less play and you have to manually slide the lock over to secure it.\n\nCameras: Front-facing is great for video chat (tested with Google+ Hangouts and Skype) and the rear-facing takes absolutely beautiful pictures. I'm almost willing to consider being \"that guy\" who uses his tablet instead of a camera.\n\nBottom Line: I haven't found a single thing I dislike about this tablet. It really is everything they say it is, which is rare in this day and age. I would happily buy this tablet again.\n\nEdit: Now that I've had it long enough for the newness to wear off enough that I'm actually willing to put it down once in a while, I'm getting 12-13 hours of battery life on the tablet alone and 17-18 with the dock. Again, results may vary but I'm still at the heavy end of the usage spectrum, so I don't foresee anyone having to worry about finding an outlet in the middle of the day.\n\nEDIT #2:For Christmas, my wife bought me a Sandisk Ultra 64 GB micro SDXC card. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009QZH6JS/ref=oh_details_o04_s01_i03\nI have tested it in both SD slots and the USB port (via USB card reader) and it works in all three. Apparently there are some SDXC cards that aren't working properly with the Infinity, so I thought I should post a link to one that does. DO NOT reformat this card. It works perfectly right out of the box with the standard exFAT format it comes with."}

I like android, and I'd never buy an apple product for all the BS lawsuits they've done to android phone tablet OEMs. As such, I can handle roadblocks and problems with ease. Unfortunately, most can't. So here is my gripes and observances so far with the device; some annoy me, and some will just cause it to be returned for most people:\n\nHARDWARE\n\n1. Some complain about the top right hand corner, being able to push the glass in. I can, but very little, so that's really nothing to me.\n\n2. The bottom left of the screen has a little light bleed. Visible when the screen is all black.\n\n3. It doesn't seem to register finger taps as well as my HTC Sensation does.\n\n4. The wifi keeps sleeping or something. So it keeps throwing a \"No connection error\" while the wifi comes back. Never had an issue like this with my phone.\n\nSOFTWARE.\n\n1. I go to use Netflix, and it just closes. I try to update the app, but it doesn't offer an update. Wait, the description at the play store says if I can't update it, click here to install it. It downloads an apk for me to install, thus requiring the install of 3rd party sources. Now it opens.\n\n2. The \"My Library\" has a serious flaw. I can't tap on any links in epubs (same issue with the Transformer 300). That's a big show stopper. And the page animations are very choppy. So I installed FBReader instead. Then I associate any epubs I download with that.\n\nHere's the weird part: I can't disable it to just get rid of it. And this obviously is ICS. Even on my phone previously preinstalled apps you couldn't remove can at least be stopped and removed from the app list (I know that from people who upgraded from 2.3 to 4. I don't run carrier crap and thus was in control via a 3rd party ROM since day one). Not here. Now I realize there might be a reason for it, but still.\n\n3. Using Hotmail. The email app has no built in settings for it, nor did it work for me doing it the exchange server route. Ended up using the app. Why it isn't a non-issue like my dad's 2+ year old ipod touch is beyond me.\n\n4. Has a newspaper app. Activated the free trial, then tries to load a newspaper. After waiting about a minute, it disappears.\n\nThere are good things about this device. Problem is, I know the average person could care less. Some of it is Asus' fault, and some of it is Google. But I have a feeling that most people (read: people who shouldn't own electronics, apple or otherwise) will get frustrated and return it.\n\nI know that with my know how I can get it to work much better than any ipad ever will, so I like it.\n\nUPDATE: The dock gives it a nice touch, so I upped it a star."}

As has been mentioned here and elsewhere, the gorilla glass isn't always properly seated on these tablets.  It bothered me enough that I eventually returned that tablet and then just decided to wait for the TF700 to come out.  When I got my TF700 I scrutinized it for problems and I have not found any so far: the gorilla glass is securely in place, there are no dead pixels and no noticeable light bleed.  When running a few apps designed for phones I do occasionally see some funny lines on the screen, but I'm not sure if that's a hardware upscaling issue or a software issue.  They are only noticeable if I look for them and they don't appear often.\n\nThe most important features of the TF700 are the speed and the screen - both are wonderful.  I'm not much of a tablet gamer (if I am going to game, I want a real gaming system), though I do enjoy casual games and I have had no issues with any games or apps slowing it down.  Even with multiple apps running in the background everything is consistently snappy and fast.  Video playback is excellent and I can easily stream full HD videos from my NAS.  In the time I have used it, I have not experienced any problems with app compatibility.  One surprising feature is how much I like the stock browser - it is very reliable and I actually prefer it over the after-market ones I've tried.\n\nThe screen is beautiful.  You have to see it to appreciate it and the viewing angle and IPS+ modes are incredible.  It definitely beats any other tablet (including the new iPad) in terms of screen.  In fact, I don't know that I really expect a better screen to come along any time soon - the resolution is more than enough for a 10\" screen and everything simply looks good.\n\nThere are several physical improvements over the TF201 that I do want to point out.  The first is that the positioning of the volume buttons and the power button are better and the buttons themselves are better.  The plastic portion on the back of the TF700 has been well discussed elsewhere, but I will point out that I never notice it while holding or using the TF700 in any position.  I think the improved reception (and I get quite good wifi - much better than the TF201) is worth the trade from the all metal back of the TF201.  In general the TF700 is very comfortable to hold and handle.\n\nOne other design change that I haven't seen mentioned elsewhere has to do with the microSd card slot.  The slot itself is slightly more recessed so that the card slips completely into the device.  With the TF201 the microSD card stuck out a fraction of a millimeter which I noticed as I slid my hand along that side.  This, by the way, was with the exact same microSD card.\n\nOne thing I don't like is that the serial number is stuck on with a sticker and is not engraved/etched/embossed onto the metal.  I took a picture of it and now I'm okay if it just falls off (or I may pull it off).\n\nA brief comment has to do with moving from the TF201 to the TF700: the app backup worked flawlessly. I put my TF201 apps on my microSD card and then was able to reinstall them without a problem on the TF700.\n\nWhat I really like about the Transformer series which makes it the best tablet, yet, is the dock.  I am using the TF201 dock and it has worked great.  The colors (both grey) may be slightly different, but, depending on the light, I'm not sure I would bet the house on it (but YMMV).  What I like about the dock is that it allows me to actually do some productive things with the TF700.  Unlike other tablets, this keyboard really lets it act like a netbook and its great for getting through some email (I use the tablet edition of TouchDown).  It's great to have the extra battery life if I ever need it (which is doubtful as this is not my primary means of consuming electronic media) but what I really like is that the tablet becomes functional for doing real things and then I can simply pop off the dock and switch to media consumption mode.  I also really like the full size SD card slot and full size USB port on the dock.  Too bad they had to choose the proprietary charging port as it would be great if you could just charge/connect to the dock with a traditional USB port.  If you don't have any need to ever use the dock to do anything productive (like write emails or take notes), then there may be other tablets which are more or less comparable to the TF700 (such as the new iPad) and the differences will boil down to personal preference.  If you're looking for the best of the best in tableting, though, get the TF700 with a dock.\n\nFinally, to put things in perspective relating to the user experience, I'm generally one to root and customize my android gadgets.  My phones and tablets over the time I've been on Android have almost always had a customized ROM on them.  So far, though, I've felt no need to do that with the TF700.  That's because it has simply worked and worked well.  Time will tell just how well the TF700holds up and I will update this if anything important changes.  For now, if you are looking for the best tablet out there, this is the one to go with. It will surely lose its position as \"best, yet\", but for now, Asus is crowned the winner."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "***UPDATE***\nAfter charging and discharging the battery several times, I found the typical charge duration to be close to advertised, around 9 hours without the dock and close to 14 with.\n***UPDATE 2: JELLY BEAN***\nInstalled Jelly Bean on this tablet yesterday (10/1/12), and I am quite pleased with the performance improvement. Everything seems smoother, and I haven't had any hangs that I occasionally experienced previously. After doing some research as to why there were hangs in the first place, I came across a chart of internal memory/storage I/O speed comparisons across many android devices. I was surprised to see that all the Asus transformers were at the very bottom of these speed tests. This would also explain the slower app launch time compared to my Galaxy Nexus phone, even after the Jelly Bean update. It pretty disappointing that Asus would cheap out on this aspect of the system, and it does seem like this is the root cause for all of the pauses and hangs in the system. A user over at XDA Developers created a modded kernel that mounts /data/ and /cache/ on an external SD card, and when using a high quality SD card (class 10), it seems to get rid of all of the problems completely. I am curious to see how this mod applied to the Jelly Bean kernel would perform. If I am successfully able to do this, I will post the results.\n********\n\nI've been wanting to purchase a tablet for a while now, but I held off on the iPads because I personally don't like iOS all that much. After playing around with a friend's original version Transformer, I did some research and decided to wait for this tablet to come out. It was definitely worth the wait.\n\nWhen used with a keyboard dock, the tablet essentially replaces my laptop. I still use my desktop for any intensive applications, but this tablet is able to provide all of the mobile productivity that I need. I can easily SSH and connect to my Linux server for any programming that I need to do. Functionality wise, it's everything that I needed.\n\n***PROS***\nThe build quality is superb; the tablet feels very solid in my hands. It's also surprisingly thin and light, which makes it easy to hold the tablet in one hand and read in portrait mode. The screen is excellent as well. Although it has a slightly lower pixel density when compared to the new iPad's screen, I still prefer this screen. My friend owns the latest generation iPad, so I did a side-by-side comparison to see which screen was better. The brightness on this tablet beats that of the iPad screen by quite a bit, and the 16:10 aspect ratio makes it much better for watching HD movies than the iPad's 4:3 ratio. Overall, there's plenty of real estate which many of the tablet-optimized apps make use of. Android also seems to do a pretty good job of scaling the non-tablet apps as well, so there's not shortage of apps for the device.\n\nThe performance in general is pretty snappy as well. I've been using Android 4.1 Jelly Bean on my Nexus phone for nearly two weeks now, and I remember that there was a noticeable difference when I switched over from ICS. I think the same can be said about ICS running on this tablet. There are a few places where it may seem to stutter or drop frames, but it's uncommon and doesn't seem to detract from the experience. ASUS did announce that they have plans to release Jelly Bean to their Transformer lineup in a few months, so I'm sure that the smoothness will improve dramatically with the update.\n\nSeveral reviewers have noted that since the speakers are located on the backside of the tablet, it may output a muffled sound when the tablet is placed on its back. Honestly, this isn't a deal for me. When laid on a flat surface like my desk, the sound is still rather clear. If I put the tablet on my bed, however, I start to notice some muffling. It's really not too bad, and I don't see where else they could have put the speakers without more people complaining.\n\n***CONS***\nUpdate: Jelly Bean now installed on the Transformer Infinity. Performance is great, but I/O speed still a slight bottleneck.\n\nThe only real downside to me is that the performance isn't what it would be with Jelly Bean installed. It's still great - apps don't hang and it's generally very responsive - but I expect Jelly Bean to really showcase the speed of the Tegra 3. After playing around with a Nexus 7 which also uses a Tegra 3, I can see how amazingly fast the OS runs. Considering that this tablet uses a Tegra 3 with a higher clock speed, the device will be at least as fluid, most likely better. Asus has already announced that they plan to roll out Jelly Bean to this tablet within a couple of months, so it should be seeing an update pretty soon.\n\nAs others have said, it seems that there is no 5GHz wireless support, which is a shame. The proprietary charger that this tablet requires is also a bit of a downer for me. I would have much preferred a micro-USB charger so that I don't need to use two different charges for my devices.\n\nLastly, the decision to keep the amount of RAM at 1GB is a bit disappointing. I feel that doubling it to 2GB would have helped future-proof the device for a couple more years to come, but I'm pretty sure that this tablet will manage fine for the next few years."}

This thing is fast!\nI do not have any issue with glass being slightly out of place like others have mentioned. And as far as some of the negatives mentioned about this tablet, well I think some people are just being a little picky. Yes it is a tablet, what do you expect for speakers? Only thing I would list as a con (and really it is kind of hard to say it is a con in actuality) is that you can not charge it up on a laptop. Maybe you can on a desktop if you have more powerful usb ports, but this tablet requires to much power to charge through normal usb ports, and that is why you can not charge it as such.\n\nI am pretty tech savvy, am also pretty picky about my gadgets. I am also kind of lazy about writing bench mark reviews and such. But I like to help my fellow potential buyers make good decisions on products when I can, because I also pretty much go by user reviews before purchasing any new toys...\n\nHere's the bottom line, if you want a tablet, if you need a tablet, this is the one to get! If you don't have it yet, well I feel sorry for you :) If you are contemplating purchasing it, just buy it already, you won't regret it one bit, you will have the best tablet out right now."}

Really sharp display (better resolution than my monitor!), great battery life, solid and attractive build, smooth interface, and fun to use. Makes my iPad friends jealous (I can tell :)).\n\nI got the keyboard yesterday and it makes it even more practical to use. I had previously been using a BlueTooth keyboard with another Android tablet I had and it was time-consuming to set up each time I wanted to use it. With the Transformer Pad Infinity, I can just dock it and the keyboard works, and it adds hours of battery life when connected to boot! It also works well to support the tablet and tilt it at my desired angle."}

I thought may be the battery need to be charged for 8 hrs as per the manual. Charged it for an hour, while its still connected to the charge tried to start it again but nope it won't start. Called asus customer service, they said to wait till 8 hrs charge complete and call back. Now its more then 3hrs charged, the orange charge light has turned green, but still its not starting. I will wait for 5 more hrs before calling the customer service again / returning it (for now giving a 1 star)\n\nBut does anyone else had this problem? I will update later more.\n\nUPDATE (after 8 hrs)>>>>>> After 8 hrs charging also, no luck. Asus support could not help much with soft/hard reset. Amazon was very helpful in promptly sending my a replacement. I am getting a new tf700 by friday. This one seems to be arrived dead. 5 stars for Amazon. I will update more after I get the new one.\n\nUPDATE (after 3 days) >>>>> After 3 days, got a new tf700 tab from Amazon. This one is good. Charged it for 8 continuous hrs as recommended. This one starts up nicely. The IPS+ mode is superb. But the power saving modes are not bad either for in home use. While I am outside I use full brightness and that does work. I liked every bit of this tablet.\n\nPROS:\n1. Lightweight, very bright, smooth tablet.\n2. Operation & setup is easy.\n3. Do not find any lag, delay once got used to use a tablet.\n4. GPS does work outside where no WiFi (used the inbuilt GPS app -Maps provided with it). Shows the turn by turn directions.\n5. The photos with the camera outside / in daylight are good. I will be using this camera occasionally (or when I forget to carry my SLR).\n\nCONS:\n1. Battery life could be a con for some. Initially I got only 4 or 5hrs max battery. Then I stopped the gps, location service, and a task manager app to close the unwanted tasks. If playing a game, switch of wifi and while in sleep switch off wifi. With all these settings, now I get a good around 8 hrs of battery life. so generally charging it daily for few hrs it enough.\n\nSo I am quite happy with this product and will change the star ratings to (5 from 2)."}

I have many friends who have the IPads and I once owned an IPhone. I got so tired of being so limited with IPhone products and switched to an Android phone and have been an Android fan since. That said this is my first tablet. Husband has an older Acer tablet and likesit but I wanted something as sleek as the IPad. The Infinity TF700 is a beauty and easy to use though I am still learning it. Picking up a dock today and looking into a case for it. So far I love everything.\nIf I had to have a complaint it would be the Owners manual which is pretty worthless :(. The other complaint would be outside in the sun like others have stated you cannot see the screen it becomes a mirror. I am wondering how one can resolve this problem if it is at all possible to do.\nThat said I am glad I waited for this tablet to come out it really rocks."}

Needless to say, it was not Amazon.  I love Amazon for their return policy and I wish it had been them.\n\nThank goodness though that I finally have an Android tablet that I did not want to return within a very short period of time.  This TF700 does have its glitches, but most of it is due to Android as I have seen the same problems on every other brand.\n\nThe first thing you will notice is the beautiful screen.  What makes it more beautiful is that so far, everything is responsive.  I finally was able to swipe the screen and it changed without stuttering.  No dead pixels and the one irk is that yes, there is some very little light bleeding going on.  Very little though compared to the other tablets I have owned or tried.  Frustrating, but not enough to return it.\n\nThis TF700 is very light weight.  Much lighter than most I have ever help in my hands.  Makes my iPad 3 feel very heavy.  The weight makes it feel fragile indeed, but only time can tell how well it holds up.  My case is still on back order, so I have been treating this like a baby.\n\nMany of the apps I use or want to use unfortunately are made for Android phones and not for tablets.  So many of them look bad.  A nicer tablet means nothing without updated apps.  Hopefully more of the apps I like to use will become tablet apps as well.  Most of those same apps are made for the iPad and look wonderful on it.\n\nAnother device with a proprietary plug for it.  Need I say more?\n\nMy volume control seems to click funny and I hope that does not become a problem some day.  I am hoping that is just the way it is, but it does not feel quite right.\n\nWith my one processor intensive game I have played for a couple of years now on Android, I get about 4.5 hours of battery life.  Which is a lot compared to other tablets i have tried.  Without playing that game and just doing other things, I got about 9 hours twice.\n\nThe TF700 is a great device. Whether or not is it worth this much is completely for you to decide.  I think it is a little on the high side, but doable.  The biggest issues are what most tablets experience: ICS.  Though ICS is a big improvement, it has some issues and hopefully Asus publishes updates in a timely manner."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "Take this review for what it is, just my experience, which has been quite disappointing.\n\nThis is my very first tablet, so to spend $500 when there are so many tablet options out there was not a straight-forward decision for me. After doing tons of research and reading many reviews on the TF700 I was expecting to be blown away by this tablet. Well, I was not at all.\nI'm not gonna write a review on the pros of this device, you've probably read too many of them. Here's what sucked about my experience, which ended with me returning the device and ordering a new one, same model.\n\nSCREEN BLEEDING: I noticed as soon as I turned this device on a bright spot almost in the center of my screen, about 3mm wide. It was mainly visible with bright colors, and it became too annoying. Looking for other similar spots in my screen I found two more, quite larger each (5-6mm) but not as bright. They never went away, even after reboots and factory resets. It just became too annoying.\n\nFREEZES AND REBOOTS: Some of the first things I've done with the 2-3 android phones I've owned is run benchmarsk test to compare them with other devices. I was quite unpleasantly surprised when I saw my tablet freezing in the middle of it, and then rebooting itself, taking about 4-5 minutes to be ready to be used. Figured it was a one-off, but I tried to run test a total of about 10 times, and they always ended in reboots. Then tried to play games (frontline commando and a pinball game) and they both ended in reboots, as if there was an issue with my tablet not being to handle any graphic intensive apps.\n\nUNRESPONSIVE BROWSING: Once I found out about the spots on my screen and the reboots, I figured I'd do some research on the internet using my tablet. Another disappointment. Scrolling down, opening new tabs, and typing in the search bar were all sluggish, to the point I wasn't sure if screen had frozen or it was just a little delay. It became impossible to do anything. Gave up and did the research on my laptop.\nThis all happened in one night, after updating firmware, and fully charging tablet. I also did 2 factory resets and nothing improved. I returned to Best Buy this morning without any issues. Even the guy helping me out was surprised by how long it took the tablet to startup (2-3 minutes). He didn't have to ask any questions about what the issue was.\n\nHopefully this is a 1/1,000,000 case, but just beware of some of the issues. Again, first tablet I owned, nothing else to compare it with, but expectations were high and not met at all by the device I received. Too bad. Just order my second device, which I hope confirms this is not the norm. Will update post as soon as device arrives."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "First, let me say that this is my first tablet.  My wife owns the Samsung 8.9\" tab, and I've certainly used it.  I really like hers, and I really like this one.  Honestly, I like the size of hers a little better.  That 9\" size really fits well in my hands.  I am 6' tall, and have typical large hands for someone this size.  Yes, I can hold this one, but it is a little more awkward.  That is certainly not the fault of the tablet.  Just thought I'd mention it.  As it turns out, she likes the bigger size of the display on mine.\n\nIf you're looking at this tablet, you already know that it is the most feature packed, high powered android tablet now available.  It is awesome.  Everything really works as well as you'd hope and expect.  All the apps I have that indicate \"HD\" or \"tablet ready\" work very well on the TF700.  Some apps won't run, and it appears to be graphics related issues.  Again, I cannot fault the tablet for this.  The screen is beautiful, it is extremely fast, the operating system is super smooth, the fit and finish are superb.  I detect no light bleed at all, and the sound is fine.\n\nThe only things I wish were different are the speaker and the volume control.  The speaker is in the back, which I really don't like.  I prefer the speakers to be in the front, like the new Samsung tablets.  The volume control is just a little too short.  You depress the left side of this button to lower the volume, and the right side to raise the volume.  Simple enough.  However, the tactile feedback is not distinctive enough, and the two ends are close enough together to not be intuitive.  I'm sure I'll get used to it, but it could be better.\n\nI really recommend this tablet.  It works so well.\n\nJust a side note here, if you are looking for a case for it, do NOT purchase the \"MoKo Slim Fit Folio Cover\" that is supposedly compatible with both the TF201 and this TF700.  It does sort of fit, but is less than ideal.  The bottom corners of the case do not fit around the bottom corners of the tablet.  Instead it just sort of hugs the edge instead of clipping around the corners.  The two tablets are not identical, and this case was not designed for this new tablet.  Just FYI."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I bought mine from B&H since Amazon didn't have it in stock. It came 2 days ago and I heard cracking noice when held the left lower corner, as if the front & back panels were not fit together completely. Asus support said I'd have to ship to them for service, instead of a replacement. That's disappointing, first for the build quality, then the service - considering it's a brand new line and I have had it for only 2 days, I'd expect this to be a replacement.\n\nOther than that, it's good looking thing. I wanted to love it.\n\nUpdate (7/23): from comments and posts on Web, it appears this (creaking around the edges) is a known issue and has been around since earlier models. According to these, it doesn't further develop into bigger problems. I'm still a bit unsure that it would not worsen over time, since that's the spot I hold the most. Right now it creaks pretty much every time pressure changes.\n\n7/24: regarding the TF700 tab and TF201 dock combo. While I'm waiting for B&H to restock (btw that's the reason I contacted Asus hoping for a quick replacement) TF700 for an exchange, I picked up a TF201 dock at a local BB so I could try it right there. There are active discussions on this combo. Here is my take based on my pair. (Please note, Asus website as of now states TF201 dock is not forward compatible with TF700.)\n\nOn the question of how they fit - the tab slides into the top of the keyboard, lock clicks, snug & smooth. I'd say that's pretty much perfect.\n\nColor difference - Mine are gray. The keyboard is slightly darker. However, I think they complement rather nicely - think of it as a subtle 2-tone scheme. I probably like this better than an identical color, although I haven't seen a TF700 dock.\n\nWhether the tab tilts back, maybe due to weight mismatch - the max open angle is about 110 deg from keyboard to tab, which is the least stable case. I can use touch screen functions gently at this angle. In addition, since I'm using the keyboard and find my other hand naturally resting on the keyboard. So I don't find this a problem either. And I don't know whether a TF700 dock would make a significant difference.\n\nFirmware update - I updated the tab's when I turned it on initially, prior to getting the keyboard.\n\nCost - can't complain about the $50 savings from a TF700 dock, let alone there are questions as to what genuine differences there really are."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "*** Update 11/3/13: So I decided to do an update to my review since there are still people buying this tablet.  Just my two cents.  I do like this tablet, but it has a major I/O bottleneck issue.  You can research this yourself to find out what it really means, but what it comes down to is that the device will slow down and even become choppy.  There are workarounds for it but from what I see it is only minimal performance increase.  As I stated below, when you pay over $500.00 for something, you should be able to install as many apps that you want from the PlayStore and it shouldn't slow things down.  I hear using different browsers helps and uninstalling some apps, but once again, why have a tablet if you can't have all these apps installed, especially when you get a 64 GB model like I did.  I have not rooted, and have not unlocked.  I'm over my year warranty but I'm not one to delve into modifying a device and risk bricking it.  It is still usable, and games run smoothly.  It just isn't up to par with my standards for being really slick.  It started out smooth, but moved on to being jittery and unpredictable at times.  I don't have any screen issues like others have reported.  I have moved my star rating down yet another notch because of these consistent I/O bottleneck issues that haven't been fixed and not sure they can be fixed by OTA updates.  I still like most of the things about this tablet, but I feel that today, there are probably better devices out there.  Maybe they don't have the keyboard dock with the SD card slot, or the Micro SD card slot on the tablet,  HDMI output and USB port that we all love to have, but when it comes down to it, I want a stable smooth product and this just isn't quite living up to my expectations and I am clearly not the only one who loved it at first then became disappointed after a while.\n\n*** Update 4/5/13:  Jellybean 4.2 came out the other day, I updated and it works fine.  Please note that Photosphere is not included, apparently this is only on Certain tablets like Nexus 10.  I was hoping for it, but it isn't there.  Also, my tablet is slowing down a good bit and hiccups more than I would like.  I'm considering doing a clean slate format to see if that clears things up a bit.  Overall I'm still happy, but for the specs and money we pay, you would think it would be consistently smooth and it just isn't.  I'm dropping my rating by one star for this.  Keep in mind this is just my experience.  I hear other people say they have no problems at all.  Maybe I have just too many apps installed, but isn't that the purpose of having a tablet?  I have also installed some apps from Amazon's free app of the day, so those can slow it down too I suppose.  I may just format it and only install the stuff I regularly use and see if there is a performance boost.  If I get around to it, I will update to advise how the factory reset worked.  At times there are no issues at all, so who knows what I will do.  PS, mine is not rooted.  I've only done the push notification updates from Asus.\n\n*** Update 1/21/13:  Thought I would update to say that I still love my non-rooted Infinity.  There have been a few updates since the Jellybean 4.1.1 came around, and so far everything is going pretty good.  I still notice some hangups here and there when using certain websites on the stock browser.  Many people prefer other browsers so you might want to try those out if the stock it sluggish for you.  The current build number on mine is 10.4.4.25 which is supposed to improve MicroSD card compatibility, guarantees that the music played in the background will no longer have lag if the user is switching between tabs in the browser, and also fixes an issue where some exported videos cannot be played to the end, a few bugs for the camera, Mio map, and movie studio app are fixed.  I have seen a few apps in the store that were not compatible with this tablet.  At this time I don't recall which ones they were, games, or Live wallpapers, or what, but I was surprised.  Most games run silky smooth, but there are some that have glitches.  Facebook is horrible on this tablet, and I'm not sure why.  Pictures are HUGE in your regular news feed.  I wish those were reduced in size unless you click on it, but that is most likely the app, not the tablet.  The latest Youtube app is no longer able to play full screen since it is missing that button, but I hear they may be working on that.  Workaround is to uninstall the updates.\nPhotos have been really smooth in transitions since the latest updates, so now when flipping thru, it is really snappy.  I currently have about 349 apps installed overall.  I'm sure things would run more smoothly if I uninstall some, but where is the fun in that.  I have stuff there for me and other people.  My TF201 keyboard dock works great.  It used to be a tight fit, but now it works perfectly.  I don't notice any other problems with the dock.  GPS locks on lightning fast.  I get over 31 Mbps on Speedtest.net's app.  I do notice significant decrease in Wifi thru just a few walls, but it still works well.  Mt favorite wallpaper, which I chose to buy the full version, is called GyroSpace 3D.  But Planets Pack is great too.  Battery life is great alone, and even better with the keyboard dock.  I still highly recommend this table if you like customizable options.  If you are a stickler for stability, then you may prefer the Apple line of products, but I am very content with my Infinity.\nStill waiting on the official Jellybean 4.2.  Hope this helps everyone.\n\n****Update 10/1/12:  I just received my Jellybean update to version 4.1.1 and so far so smooth.  I do notice a smoother experience while scrolling on the homescreen and in the default browser.  There are a few enhancements to the lock screen and when you press the power button in for a few second you get a few different options.  The upgrade did not delete any apps for those concerned about it.  But it is usually recommended that you backup anything you are concerned about losing.  The Gallery scrolls much more smoothly now.  Very nice.  They added Asus MyFrame in the Live Wallpaper.  Just an overall improvement so far.  And Adobe Flash seems to be working fine on mine.  I will test out more of it tonight and report any odd findings or any cool features.  I'm sure they will be posted somewhere though.  Have fun everyone!!!\n\n****Update 8/29/12:  Sorry for the constant updates, but I forgot to include in yesterday's update that I have been experiencing an odd behavior with my Infinity.  I usually use the keyboard-docked Infinity and when done, I just close it to put it to sleep, then when I open it later, all is fine... I may do this a few times, then suddently, here and there when I open it, I get a blank black screen and I have to press and hold the power button for about 10 seconds and it restarts.  This is a little annoying when you want to open it quickly to do something, so I have no idea why it does this.  I always have it docked to the keyboard, so I don't know if that is the underlying problem or if it is something else.  Thought it was worth noting, but not enough to cause me to drop a star rating.\n\n****Update 8/28/12:  Time for a much needed update.  So first I'd like to start by saying that I'm very satisfied with the tablet.  It isn't perfect, but it suits my needs.  I have no regrets getting the Infinity.\n  I will let you know that a new problem that I have noticed is sometimes, during some web browsing, the default browser will freeze up and then just close by itself.  The good thing is that when I reopen it, it takes me right back to where I was.  Some sites that I use with a login have quirks that make it annoying, but not enough to make me mad.\n  Another thing I noticed is when playing videos that are at 720p, I notice a little stutter now and then, as if it pauses for a millisecond, but the audio stays in sync.  Doesn't happen all the time, but still happens even when on the Performance mode setting.  I haven't read anything about anyone else having this issue, so maybe I have to adjust something or turn off other apps running in the background.  I thought it was worth mentioning.\n  Games run smoothly, most web browsing is smooth, Youtube plays nicely.  I'm Still happy.\n\n****Update 7/27/12:  First off there was an firmare update over the weekend.  For those that don't know, Asus is very good at pushing out updates. This seems like a big one and it only stated that it was to improve performance, but I found an online comment of the changelog, and it was a lot of stuff.  For info, look it up.  firmware v9.4.5.26 should help you find the info.\n  OK, regarding my comment below about Riptide, turns out that it only needed the options tweaked to higher graphics and now it looks a lot better.  I guess the default is the lowest settings to improve performance.  But the Infinity has no problem handling the graphics boosted all the way up to the highest setting.  I'm sure we will still run into some problems with the apps not being enhanced for the 1920  1200 screen.\n  I'm still loving my Infinity.  Hope everyone is having a good experience with their tablet as well, regardless of which brand or model you chose. There is something for everyone.\n\n****Update 7/28/12:  Sorry for the constant updates, but I figured some people would want to know any additional info as I find out more info. I loaded Draw Something app and it will not open on my Infinity 64GB.  It loads the company logo then just closes.  I've seen several apps in the Playstore that are not compatible with this device.\n  Also just be careful with the case you order if you get one because several say they are for the Prime and Infinity, but the buttons are located in different places, so it won't work.  I found a nice one which I will review as well.  Fits nice and snug.  It is the Poetic Infinity Case TF700 PU Leather Portfolio Stand for tablet and keyboard dock.  All cameras are viewable without any blockage, just no magnet holding it closed.  I ordered it here at Amazon.\n  After several days playing with the Infinity, i can say that there are slight glitches, but I love it.  I feel that it was well worth the money and the wait.  Just my opinion.\n\n****Update 7/26/12:  So I purchased the full version of Riptide GP, and when I started it up, I was disappointed in the graphics this time around.  It looked great on the Prime, very crisp and clean. But on the Infinity, the edges of everything are very jagged including the water splashes on the screen.  I assume that this has to do with the HD screen, and the game wasn't designed for that 1920  1200 full HD screen.  It runs smoothly, but looks crappy.  Hopefully an update will come out that fixes this.  I also got the demo of Puddle, and it looks really bad too.  Let me rephrase that, it doesn't look as good as I thought it would.  Plus the physics of the liquid isn't as smooth as I think it should run.  I'm mentioning these games because I think it has to do with the games not being enhanced for the 1920  1200 screen.  I don't blame the device itself, just the lack of support for now.\n\n****Update 7/24/12:  I've browsed some websites, played some games, played some lower res .avi clips, watched some Youtube videos at different qualities, and everything seems very nice and smooth.  There were some minor hiccups in watching some videos at times, but could have been due to many other reasons, like the internet connection at the time, etc.  I've seen that happen on the iPad 2 also.\n  Also, when viewing high resolution photos that I've taken on my digital camera, as soon as you pull up the photo, it starts out looking kind of low resolution, but about 1 second later, it pops into really clear resolution.  So if you flip through pictures quickly, you won't necessarily see them in their full glory, unless you allow it a second to fill in the detail.  This is true even with the default sample photos on the Infinity.  I believe my Prime (when I had it) did the exact same thing.  No worries to me.  I think when I viewed the photos on an iPad 2, they showed up straight away without having to redraw the details like that.  I will check later tho about the iPad 2.  I don't know anyone with the New iPad to compare there.\n  And can anyone else download the Starlight Live Wallpaper Free version and let me know if it is all screwed up now?  I think it has to do with the wallpapers showing the full image and remaining static vs. scrolling side to side as you swipe the main screens left and right.  I really hope this gets an option to switch to either option in the Jellybean OS update, which JB has been confirmed for this tablet with no set release date as of yet.\n\n****Update 7/22/12:  So while typing on Amazon comments, I had some weird glitches happening where the cursor would jump suddenly to another part of the text field and it really was annoying.  I will try another virtual keyboard other than the default one that I'm currently using.\n\n****Update:  I forgot to mention the charge time for the tablet.  I charged it fully as recommended before using it initially.  Then I let it run down to 1%.  I timed it to see how long it would take to fully charge back to 100%.  Time taken was 2 hours and 5 minutes.  This is just the tablet, nothing to do with the docking keyboard.\n\n___________________________\nMy initial review:  So after many months of waiting since returning my Asus Transformer Prime, I finally received my Infinity.  For the most part it looks similar, but there are some noticeable enhancements.  I'll start with my pros and cons and will only mention things that matter to me, and I may miss some things that you find important.  Just ask in the comments if you need any questions answered and I will do my best to get back to you.\n__________________________\nPros:\n  *I opted for the Amethyst Grey color this time around, and although I really like it, I think I prefer the Champagne Gold.  But regardless, both colors are very nice.  I don't think you can really go wrong either way.\n  *The screen is very nice and higher resolution to the previous Prime.  I hear people complain about it being a fingerprint magnet, but I've used many tablets, and they ALL are fingerprint magnets.  Using a good stylus can help here, and the cloth that comes with it works perfectly for cleaning those nasty fingerprints.\n  *Asus did not load too much bloatware, and the stuff they did preload is mostly useful.  Some people may not agree, but at least there aren't too many really large preloaded apps.\n  *I got the 64 GB model, and that is plenty of storage, plus the MicroSD card slot adds to that, and the cloud storage.  We should be good to go for a while.\n  *Sound is excellent for being a single speaker.  Using headphones sounds even better yet for music or games.\n  *Power button is easier to use than the Prime, and the volume rocker is placed in a better location IMO.\n  *So far apps have run smoothly.  I'm sure there will be glitches but none yet.\n  *Web browsing is smooth so far also.  I'm using the default browser for now to test it out.\n  *As most people know, it supports Flash.  This was important to me.\n  *Both cameras were upgraded and are very nice.  I still have to play around more with it to get to know it better.\n  *ICS OS runs pretty good.  This can get better if and when we get JB.\n  *GPS locks on really quickly for me.  It took forever on my Prime when I had it, so this was nice to see that it works now.  In less than 5 seconds I have 5 satellites, then a few seconds later, I have 14 in view per GPS Test app.  And this is in my apartment on an overcast day.\n  *WiFi Analyzer app shows that the antenna is working better this time around also.\n  *Anything I bought previously on the Google Playstore shows purchased and ready for me to download again without buying again. Some people may not know that.\n________________\nCons:\n  *There can sometimes still be lag when scrolling, but nothing serious.  And I hear JB OS will help that out too.\n  *I think there are plenty of apps, free or paid, available for Android, but some people may prefer the Apple store for iPad since they have \"more\" apps.  I do think Google Playstore should have a section exclusively for apps enhanced for tablets rather than having us rely on telling each other, or finding out for ourselves.  But so far, no problems.\n  *Sometimes I feel like the tablet can dig into my hand when holding it and can be uncomfortable.  But it feels better than the Prime did due to the slight redesign.\n  *Some random crashes here and there when closing the docked tablet to the keyboard when reopening it\n  *Some random crashes while using the default browser. As well as some quirks while trying to click on data input fields on some websites and pulling down dropdown menus.\n  *I noticed some slight stutter while playing back 720p videos out to my HDTV.  Very slight though.\n\n_______________________________________________\n\nI have to say that I am impressed with this tablet, however I don't notice a HUGE difference in the screen, since I don't have the old Prime any longer to compare against it.  Yes it is very nice though.\n\nThe redesign is very nice.  I prefer the location of the volume rocker and headphone jack, and I like how the edge isn't as beveled as the Prime, so the plugs aren't as exposed, and the MicroSD card doesn't stick out at all now.\n\nI have read some people's reviews complaining about the plastic strip and the power/volume buttons looking and feeling cheap.  I don't find this to be true.  It fixes the problems that the Prime had, and I think they did a great job redesigning it to blend well with the color.  It feels very solid to me.\n\nThe one minor complaint that I had, which didn't change my rating, it that Amazon listed this as available for order and available for 2 day deliver, which they did not hold up to that quote.  I have Amazon Prime and should get the 2 day delivery, however, I ordered mine Monday morning and received it Friday afternoon.  According to my calculations, that is more than 2 days.  Come on Amazon.  Don't post what you can't deliver.\n\nEagerly awaiting the availability of the keyboard dock.\n\nI will update my review as needed depending on my findings."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "People who want a Transformer pretty well know they want a transformer.  And if the keyboard dock -- that not only doesn't drain your device's battery like a wireless board, but charges it and comes with a hinge that provides far more viewing angle flexibility -- is important to you, then there isn't much competition out there.\n\nThe Infinity stands apart from even other transformers with its strikingly high pixel density and super ips+ brightness.  Pixel density is mostly going to benefit readers by providing clear and sharp text.  Blurry text can add to eye strain over long reading sessions.  It's going to be less noticeable for gaming and video watching.  Super IPS+ is somewhat useful for outdoor viewing -- this is hurt a little by how reflective the glass on the infinity is and that gets magnified in brighter environments, so daylight viewing isn't exactly ideal, but it's better than any LCD screen I've seen.  If you're not a reader, consider the tf300 for a discount and a longer battery life.\n\nThe Infinity's specs are top of the line, but two are slightly problematic if you're concerned about future proofing.  The first is the 1GB of RAM.  Asus speed the ram up, but didn't increase the capacity.  Now I doubt you'll feel that pinch if want to buy a new tablet every year or two, but I suspect this will be the first bottleneck to emerge for longer term buyers.  If applications and games ever do fully support the Infinity's big resolution, they'll probably be pretty RAM hungry too.\n\nThe second spec of some small concern is that this only has Bluetooth 3.  Again, not a big deal today, because virtually no Bluetooth 4 accessories exist yet.  But BT4 is not just an evolutionary boost to the protocol, it's a little revolutionary, allowing super low powered peripherals to get, not weeks or months off their own battery, but years, and allowing tiny accessories to be practical.  Most of what is in the pipeline are exercise or health related, but you never know what awesome stuff might be out there once the possibilities sink in.  If you plan to get a phone with BT4, you can shrug this weakness off and use your accessories with that.\n\nThe only build issue for me is the speaker placement.  I'll never understand why tablet makers, and virtually none do this, don't put the speakers on the front.  These tabs are designed for consumption of movies and music, among other things, and why would you want to direct the sound away from them?  No matter how good the speaker, and the Infinity's is pretty good, it'll always be better if it's facing you.  Hard to dock Asus for this since everyone does it though.\n\nAll in all, the Infinity is lighter than I imagined, as bright and sharp as I'd hoped, is fast and versatile, and is doubtless the best Android tablet on the market today.  Asus has loaded it with useful goodies like a word processor, cloud storage, desktop streamer, a good set of performance profiles and plenty of helpful widgets.  It's an eye-catching device, especially docked, looking like an ultrabook -- easily the most conspicuous tech I've ever owned.  I'm never completely satisfied, but I am pretty happy with this buy."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I decided that I needed a tablet at the beginning of 2012. I was originally going to get the Transformer Prime but I decided to wait for the Infinity after it was announced at the CES. It has been a long wait but it was worth every day spent tabletless. I have no complaints. WiFi reception is as good as every other device I have (Galaxy Nexus, Kindle Fire and Toshiba laptop) and the speed and smoothness of the ICS OS combined with the Tegra 3 is awesome. I have not really exercised the speed of the Tegra 3 CPU, but everything I have run so far flies. I am going to get the dock soon and that can only make life better."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I have upgraded from the transformer prime to the infinity. Over all its a solid device. My wife has an iPad and I have had an iPhone4 for a long time now. I much prefer Android to iOS. Below is a list of my Pros and Cons.\n\nPros:\n\nWidescreen ratio. Great for watching movies! and now with HD resolution! New Screen is gorgeous!\n\nGPS fixed! works great! no dongle needed!\n\nDock from TF201 works with TF700\n\nCons\n\nThe touch screen is not as sensitive: when i drag items with my finger while docked, they sometimes get dropped. I use a lighter touch when the pad is docked, otherwise i would just push the screen back. I never had this issue on the 201.\n\nSome apps don't work. They crash immediately.  I'm sure there will be updates to fix this. Not sure why this should be, as i thought  the app running hardware was identical. I hope I don't have a lemon.\n\nThere is a plastic strip at the top edge of the device to help with antenna reception. The power button and volume control are located on the top edge, and are now plastic as well. They feel kinda cheap.\n\nFace unlock was released for TF201, but not on TF700? Why?"}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I'd been waiting for this tablet for months, having used a rooted HP Touchpad running Android for the last year (heavy, slow and buggy but better than nothing).  The Infinity is, well, infinitely better as a tablet.  The stunningly beautiful crisp high-res screen makes reading e-books and text so much easier on the eyes, really bright & viewable in all light conditions, it's easy to change screen brightness settings, and the whole tablet runs lightning fast.  I tried the new Ipad 3 for a week prior to buying the Infinity and the Ipad just did not measure up to the Android experience: sure it was a pretty whiz-bang gadget, but between the lack of ability to customize, rigid UI, high prices on most practical apps, and the annoying ads that Apple puts in everything (that surprised me) -- the Ipad just was not for me.  The screen resolution looks about the same to the naked eye between the Ipad 3 & the Infinity.  The Infinity has so much more true usability for my needs, and is much more flexible for mobile computing than Ipad. The front and rear-facing cameras work great and are easy to figure out settings, web browsing is hassle-free & feels similar to using my desktop, games run fast, I love the integration with Google services (not just email & talk but Google Drive/docs, navigation, etc.) and Asus preinstalls some useful apps. All that said, my only complaint with the specific unit I received is that there are 3 or 4 dead pixels in the middle of the screen, a tiny black spot. A mild annoyance but little things like this are understandable, since my machine was in the first production run by Asus. I spoke to Asus' warranty service who recommended returning it to the retailer if I didn't want to send it in & wait for them to fix & return it. So I'll be returning this tablet for another identical one, which Amazon makes easy. In all though, I am quite pleased with the machine and happy I chose the Asus Infinity, and I look forward to receiving the docking station when that becomes available."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "Let's start this off by saying I am a huge Android fan and a big nerd.  I have been waiting for the Infinity since it was first announced.  I wanted the Prime, but that turned out to have lots of issues, so I waited patiently.  FINALLY, it has arrived.  I had high hopes for this device that it could be a suitable replacement for a low power laptop.  In that function, it does sort of deliver.  If your uses for a laptop are only browsing the web, watching videos, e-mail, word processing, and maybe some light Excel, you should be good to go here.\n\nThis tablet comes equipped with the latest Tegra 3 processor, with higher clock speeds than what's in the Transformer Prime as well as the TF-300.  That extra clock speed pretty much only evens things out when it comes to performance since the higher resolution of this tablet is going to make it take a hit in frame-rate.  The Infinity has a 1900 x 1200 Super IPS screen, most current tablets have 1200 x 800 screens.  This panel is incredibly sharp, incredibly bright (600 nits), and has great viewing angles.  So if a beautiful screen is a pre-requisite for your purchase, you definitely want to look at the Infinity.  Other noteworthy features would be HDMI out and a micro SD card slot (and a full sized SD card slot if you buy the dock).  I can't stand tablets that don't have expandable storage.  I bought a 32GB micro SD card from Newegg for $15 the other day, so doubling my storage will be great for media.  Also of note, performance wise, is that this tablet can finally handle x264 encoded videos (high profile).  If you understood that, you probably know that previous generation tablets such as those with the Tegra 2, or other Qualcomm processors, could not decode those videos, and for me, made those tablets useless.\n\nCamera performance is solid.  Takes sharp pictures, not too much shutter lag.  But taking pictures with a tablet camera always seemed silly to me.  Front facing camera is what you tend to expect from any front facing camera I'd say, maybe slightly above average.\n\nAdvertised usage is roughly 9 hours without the dock, and around 16 with the dock (which has it's own battery that the tablet can draw from).  From my usage so far, I would find these numbers to be reasonably accurate.\n\nSpeaking of the dock - The dock is definitely the selling feature of the Transformer line.  It's definitely a huge step up from just typing on the virtual keyboard, but definitely not a replacement for a full sized keyboard.  It makes typing out a long e-mail tolerable on a tablet, but you won't be wanting to type any novels on it.  It definitely takes getting used to, since some of the important keys are very small, such as the right shift.\n\nOverall smoothness of operation still leaves a little to be desired.  You get the usual Android hiccups here and there.  I'm hoping that Jelly Bean (Project Butter) fixes this, finally.  ASUS is known to do a great job releasing timely updates to their devices, unlike many manufacturers.\n\nFor the people who are into benchmarks, I ran a couple of tests, in Balanced mode (the Infinity has 3 power use modes...Performance, Balanced, and Power Saver):\n\nQuadrant - 4840\nAntutu - Total Score 12202 (CPU 7655, GPU 1331, RAM 2584, IO 632)\nLinpack - Single Thread 54.43 Mflops, Multi Thread 84.63\n\nLastly, as others have mentioned, the speaker is horrible and the placement was poor.  It's on the right side, roughly where you'd hold the device in landscape mode.  You'd be best to hold the device upside down, so the speaker is on top, or use headphones.\n\nTo sum it all up, I'd say that this tablet meets most of my expectations, I was only mildly disappointed in the performance of the device.  At this stage in the game, it should be running smoother in overall UI responsiveness.  Fingers crossed for Jelly Bean.  There are faster processors on the horizon, which I would probably wait for if you're a performance junkie, but it's going to be eons before ASUS puts one of those in a Transformer style tablet form factor..."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "4/6/13'\n\nI just deleted my original 5-star, glowing review (I was one of the first early adopters who bought the TF700T when it first came out last Summer).. I was eagerly waiting almost a year for a full-HD tablet and on paper everything looks good and should be good. This was my first tablet and of course I didn't know better so everything seemed nice and \"fast\" at the beginning, just like the 70% of people giving 5-star reviews here right after purchasing this tablet. Well, what an expensive mistake it turned out to be!\n\nAfter 8 months of daily use and having tried other TF700Ts (all with similar issues) and comparing it to other newer  hi-res tablets, I'm *gladly* getting rid of it. Despite the quad-processor and all the nice on-paper-only-specs, what kills it is the slow NAND RAM memory (not the storage memory) and the ASUS GUI overlay on top of Jelly Bean. To make things worse and adding insult to injury, the RAM is limited to 1GB(!).. it's like having a PC with very slow non-upgradeable 512MB RAM after system overhead. It makes using the tablet feel \"bloated\", lagging and excruciatingly slow. Of course people who just bought it (including me then) are blinded by the shinny full-HD screen (pun intended) and excited by the on-paper-only potential but that wears off pretty soon once you put the tablet to heavy use and realize how other tablets handle the same load. Don't take me wrong, the tablet works relatively well doing passive stuff (like reading) and the screen is bright and nice but that's it. The first months I was hoping for a miraculous firmware update, many came but nothing really changed. This thing stutters while browsing or just using apps. Typing gets extremely annoying if you are used to fast computers, smartphones or newer tablets. It takes time for the tablet to catch up with you and sometimes freezes up or blanks out. No, not even cold re-booting or updating to the latest firmware will fix this (I just updated to ASUS's latest modified version of Android 4.2.1) and it's still slow and buggy. Yes, you could root the 700T (cleanrom, data2SD) but that misses the point. I should not be the one half-fixing a mediocre engineered tablet and on top of that losing my warranty doing it. Besides SD cards have limited read/write cycles.\n\nI bought a Nexus 10 directly from Google and the difference is like night and day, the Nexus is very snappy and you don't feel the \"lag\" time while typing, browsing or just interacting with the tablet. You don't feel like running faster than the tablet despite the fact that the Nexus pushes way more pixels than the TF700T. And yes, I'm using the same apps and browser. I also got an OTG micro-USB adapter to use my flash drives, micro-SD memory cards and hard drive with my N10. Pure Android is the way to go from now on. I want the Android experience the way Google designed it: clean, lean and fast. With Nexus devices you get quick updates directly from Google servers, which is the icing on the cake. Just in case you are wondering, devices in the Nexus series although produced by different OEM's, they are mainly designed and sold directly by Google to showcase it's Android operating system at it's best and of course do not have manufacturer (or wireless carrier) modifications and are also unlocked. OEM branded devices (Asus, Samsung, Sony, LG, HTC, etc) usually have heavily modified and bloated OS overlays on top of Android.\n\nAlso, another reason not to buy this tablet is that the 700T is almost 1 year old (it was announced last Spring) so hopefully expect an improved model soon with fixed specs. Of course I would not get one because of the modified version of Android they use with ASUS bloatware and other crappola which is always running in the background bogging down everything. But that is just me."}

Suffice it to say Apple markets well and I have a have an Asus laptop which exceeds my needs.\n\nThe lower price, number of ports, satisfaction of existing apps which meet my particular needs, the ever growing android AP market, and the customization of the android world sealed buying this tablet for me.

My issues with it are as follows:\n\n1) speaker (as several have pointed out) is on the back and just doesn't sound that great. Couldn't they at least put two?\n2) it does hang on occasion,  not often, but my Toshiba never did.\n3) some light bleed,  less than Toshiba.  I can deal with it.\n4) no micro USB\n5) lastly it is not as comfortable to hold as the Toshiba.  It is light but the edges can be uncomfortable depending how you hold onto it.\n\nOn the good side - screen,  wifi, battery,  etc... are all good.  I really like the tablet.\n\nI will probably be keeping it and sending my Toshiba back.  The only thing that really gets to me is the speaker on the back.\n\n**** update\nOk after 3 days of use I decided to send my Toshiba back and keep the Asus.\n\nMy only real issue that has been nagging me is that the edges of the tablet make it a little uncomfortable to hold in some positions.  The Toshiba was very comfortable in the hands.  I ordered a case which will probably take care of the issue."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I've only had the tablet for a short week. The previous tablet I had was a tf101 which, according to amazon, is 15 months old. I tried to focus on initial impressions as others have given step by step summary; though I will very likely update this review after my next trip (when I use a tablet heaviest):\n-\nThe screen is very nice; much brighter than the tf101 on max brightness. My 720p videos play without issue and are much crisper than on the tf101 (which occasionally stalled). I mostly have 720p due to the tf101; but will upgrade try a few 1080p high-profile (which the tf101 could not handled) at a later date. CPU usage is around 25% when using hardware decoding on the 720P.\n-\nSpeakers are awful (very low volume, only one). The tf101 has 2 and the sound is quite a bit louder (though I would not call the tf101 loud). Very tempted to give this tablet a 3* for the huge step down in speakers.\n-\nWith IEM the sound is a tad softer than the tf101 but the quality seems a bit bitter (maybe it is my imagination but it seems somehow richer or more detailed). I use the a161 which is reasonable pair but my ears are defective.\n-\nCan't comment on pre-installed software; my focus was making sure video/email/most often used apps (by myself) worked before my trip :)\n-\nThe build is quite a bit better than the tf101. The tablet is thinner and it has some flex where the glass joins the unibody; mostly in the upper left corner. However, this is slight give not so much separation of the panel. Also the ports are in odd positions on the tf700 (well i find them odd; maybe because I am right handed); the most annoying is the placement of the headphone jack in the lower left corner. The microsd is more prone to popping out if bumped (the tf101 was very good in this area); the power cable is 1 foot longer; but the power adapter is a minor down grade (for the tf101 the prongs fold up which is nice for travel) - not sure if they have the same amps. One nice thing is that the power button is slightly recess so I'm hopeful the tablet will be less likely to power on when in my backpack (I had this issue with the tf101)\n-\nThe wifi has wicked good reception; it sees the signal across the street which my razr cannot pick up; speed test maxs out at 20Mb/s (both up and down)\n-\nThe tablet will hang if doing modest i/o (download a lot of apps; and such). This is actually quite annoying. There are a set of web pages I like to scan for news update and I will frequently hop between them using multiple tabs as they load. With the tf101 i never really noticed periods of stalls (maybe they existed but were not quite annoying); with the tf700 there are frequently long periods where the entire tablet will 'hang' (more than once andriod pop up will occur asking me to either wait or kill the app). I never noticed this issue with the tf101 and I used it on a week long vaction just before purchasing the tf700. This has to be my number one gripe about the tablet and is definitely a steep downgrade in behavior when compared to the tf110.\n\nAlso it seems that the screen is more sensitive (i.e, a lot of taps seemed to be missed unless I flatten my finger against the screen). This might be related to the higher resolution not sure.\n-\nWhen wifi is heavily used the left upper corner will get a bit warm - i guess around 100F; which is noticable. The ventilation of heat seems efficient and it quickly cools down when load is reduced.\n-\nThe cpu of the tablet is clearly faster (streams play very smoothly; but the stalls hide nearly all benefits). Text is a little crisper but not significantly (perhaps because I am using modest size text; what ever is default - i'm sure with smaller point size it would be more significant; the movies I watch show significantly more detailed on the new screen).\n-\n\n-\n\n-\nThe speakers are quite a downgrade from the tf101; they are softer (I found the tf101 rather soft compared to the acer; and these are much worse than the tf101; more so they are placed on the back and furthered muffled by the table or whatever).\n--\nMy biggest ask is for something a bit larger (12 or 14 inch); but I cannot penalize the product on that account - more or less a comment to marketing.\n-\nI actually prefer the backing on the tf101; I understand to make the tablet thinner they had to do something different; also the grey has a rather sick purple tint. The least they could do is make it pure grey :)\n-\nAnyways in summary; I would not recommend upgrading to this tablet until asus fix the stalls (no clue if it is hardware or device drivers) they definitely impact browsing experience which is one of my major usage for a tablet."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "This device is very slick in both style and design.  I would compare it to the elegance of the Ipad.  The device is also very light, and I have no problems holding it hours on end.  Even while reading e-books and supporting it on my chest its lighter then a real book.  Watching 1080p videos on this is incredible and the built-in speaker sounds pretty good too.\n\nWe also have a Plex Media server in our house.  I installed the Plex Android Client on the tablet and tried streaming both 720 and 1080 content.  The streaming performance was outstanding.  Not one glitch even when moving from floor to floor.  The other cool thing is you can do is output the tablets video through the micro-hdmi connector to your TV. Wow.  We have a a TV in our basement that's not connected to cable so I decided to try it.  It was just like having a blu-ray player on the TV!  I also tried Netflix, Hulu and Crackle.  Both performed without any issues.  I can't wait to travel for work with this thing!  No more boring nights in the hotel room.\n\nI'm not a big gamer, but if you go into the TegraZone app download a game called \"Dead Trigger\".  You won't believe the graphics.\n\nWhen I bought this I knew it didn't have cellular conductivity, but that didn't bother me since I always carry my Android phone.  What you need to do if you don't have WiFi, but have a phone with data is install a tethering app on your phone.  This allows your phone to function as a WiFi access point to which your tablet can connect to.  I use this on my quite a bit with my laptop.  The tablet works the same.\n\nI recently got the keyboard dock and this really extends the functionality of the device.  For one if your typing quite a bit the keyboard vs the screen is much more productive. Two, the dock also has another battery which extends the battery life to 14.5.  It also contains an SD card slot and a USB port.  I bought the TF201 dock which is used on the older \"Prime\" unit, but it does work on the \"Infinity\".  This will save you $50 if you want the dock.  Use Goggle there blowing out the old docks for $99 bucks.\n\nUpdates\n-------\nAsus recently announced that Jelly Bean is coming for this device in the next few months! :)!\nThe latest firmware update from 7-28-12 fixed the slow usb transfer speeds.  ver: 9.4.5.26\n\nPros:\nSuper fast performance.\nLove the IPS screen mode when using the tablet outside.\nTouch is very accurate.\nScreen size is perfect for reading a full size html website and ebooks.\nOutstanding Video performance.\nFront and rear cameras.  Quality seems pretty good, but not as good as standalone camera.\nGPS performance is great, even inside my house.  I use the CoPilot app.\nSide button placement does not interfere with your hand placement irregardless of the tablets orientation.  The buttons also take a good amount of pressure to engage, thus when its sitting on something (like your lap) the button won't accidentally get pressed.\nWiFi conductivity is excellent.  No problems connecting and maintaining connections.  Signal strength is great.\n\nCons:\nNo 5Ghz wireless N support. Only 2.4 Ghz is supported.\nNot running the latest Android OS (Jelly Bean).\nInternal speaker is on the back of unit.  Sound is muffled if its laying down on a table."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "UPDATE: Review updated based on second identical TF700 that arrived. Only minor updates as there were no changes with the second device.\n\nBACKGROUND:\n\nFirst, I should note that I've already gone through several tablets in my ongoing search. Several months ago, I started with the Asus Transformer TF201, Acer Iconia A510, Toshiba Excite AT305T, Acer Iconia A700, and now, the Asus Transformer TF700T. All in attempt to find a solid and somewhat high-end tablet. But in the end, they were all returned due to one or more issues that simply couldn't be ignored.\n\nOf them all, the TF700 was probably the most anticipated of the bunch. It had the most promise based on specs and early reviews. Folks have been talking about this one almost immediately after the TF201 was released. So let's just jump in!\n\nHARDWARE:\n\nThe first thing I noticed was the left and right sides are flat at first, then curve towards the back. The top and bottom still curve almost immediately. And the back itself is a very smooth surface. There is also the expected plastic bar towards the back/top of the device to help improve wireless reception (more on that later). This is also where the rear 8MP camera, mic, and flash are located.\n\nThese are good things as I already noticed the tablet is a bit nicer to hold as the sides don't dig into your hands. This also means that when the MicroSD card is installed (left side), it's completely flush with the device. The power button is at the top left, volume rocker top right, headphone jack on the left towards the bottom, and MicroHDMI right above it, also on the left. Dock/Power ports are still at the bottom of course. The power cable is a bit loose when attached to the bottom, but never felt as though it would fall out.\n\nI did notice while gaming the tablet \"feels\" slightly warmer than the TF201. I think that might be due to the different material they are using now. It feels more plastic-like than metallic. However, while playing some Tegra 3 games, I only saw a max temp of 95 degrees with my infrared thermometer. That's the same temps I saw with the last ASUS tablet.\n\nSo this is by no means hot or uncomfortable to use and is the coolest running Tegra 3 device I've used. And other than that, there isn't really a whole lot changed with the physical hardware. Which also means my TF201 Burlex case fits. Although the top volume rocker is a little tricky to push as it's partially covered. So it's not quite perfect, but it would work.\n\nGORILLA GLASS:\n\nUnfortunately, we still have poorly installed gorilla glass. While holding at any position, you can push down slightly along the edges of the glass, which has a small amount of play. This was the same issue I had with two previous TF201s and now, two TF700s. There is supposed to be a beveled glass edge around the whole device, but it's noticeably higher than it should, more so in some areas.\n\nIn fact, at the bottom, there is one area that's keeps lifting up higher than the rest of the edges. Keep in mind, we are talking about a relatively small amount of play. But it is noticeable, something I've only seen with ASUS tablets, and it get's annoying every time you hold it and feel the squishiness of the glass.\n\nThis poor build quality has always been of concern to me regarding how long this glue is going to hang in there before we see some real separation going on. If you're using a case or with the keyboard, where you are less likely to actually hold the tablet itself, you might not care as much.\n\nSOFTWARE:\n\nOut of the box you've got Android ICS 4.0.3. Which is exactly the same as any other ICS tablet. There is also a ASUS firmware updating waiting as soon as you finish the initial setup. However, it looks like it only updated the Kernel as it's still at 4.0.3. I didn't expect 4.1 quite yet, but 4.0.4 was loaded from the factory on the A700. There's always time for more updates.\n\nOtherwise if you've used ICS on a tablet before, everything here is pretty close to stock. ASUS does have their updated menu with a few extra shortcuts, such as Power Save / Balanced / Performance settings.\n\nDISPLAY:\n\nNaturally, this is one of the biggest new upgrades going from the TF201 to the TF700. It's got 1920x1200 pixel resolution versus the old 1280x800. That's a lot more pixels on the same 10.1\" LED display. That's the same resolution my 24\" monitor runs at. Combined with the same Super IPS+ 600 nit display, and you've got one nice (and bright) looking display. Viewing web pages and PDFs in particular, look excellent in landscape or portrait mode.\n\nI've been playing several HD (720p to 1080p) videos and everything looks great. This new display has gone towards a much more neutral color tint versus the decidedly warm/yellow tint of the TF201. The colors are vibrant, accurate (to my eye anyway), small text is crisp, detailed, and it's just a nice screen to look at. Super IPS+ is most certainly readable in daylight. It's very, very bright.\n\nOne negative that I've noticed is that on a very white images, with the brightness at any setting, there is vertical banding on the screen (in landscape mode). It's basically dozens of faint slightly off-color bands that appear to \"move\" as you tilt the tablet left to right. This is the first I've of seen this on any tablet, and was present on both TF700s I have.\n\nYou can google this to get a better idea of what I'm talking about; although be aware this term is used to describe a wide range (and severity) of related symptoms. This would be on the lighter, but still noticeable, side of the spectrum. On the plus side, other than banding, the screen color and back-light is very even and uniform. In other words, no light bleed on either device.\n\nSomething you should also be aware of is scaling with lower resolution content. Low res content tends looks a bit worse since you're having to stretch a small number of pixels across, well, a LOT more pixels. Basically, just more pixelated and jaggies (aliasing). So until everybody at least gets up to 1080p/1200p, it's something to be aware of.\n\nAnd this is something that affects all LCD displays.\n\nPERFORMANCE:\n\nWhat initially gave me high hopes for this device over the A700, was the fact that it had much nicer looking specs, while running at the same resolution. The TF700 has a slightly higher-end Tegra 3 chipset, better thermal design (for heat dissipation), higher clock speed, and faster DDR3 memory. I was hoping this, along with ASUS tweaks, would be enough to help the tablet keep up with pushing a much higher resolution of 1920x1200.\n\nThe good news is that it is noticeably faster than the A700, which struggled to keep up with virtually everything I threw at it. I've already played several games including Shadow Gun, Glow Ball, Siegecraft, GTA III, and Dungeon Defenders. They all ran much better, although with Shadow Gun, it still has a slightly lower frame rate when there was a lot going on.\n\nFor some reason, Adobe PDF kept partially loading pages. But viewing large PDF's with Polaris Office worked, and isn't as bad as the A700; but still not as smooth as I'd like. There are still times where I have to wait a few seconds for it to load a page I skipped to. And really, the whole tablet overall has a bit of sluggishness to it depending on what you're doing. I frequently get the \"wait for program to respond\" messages in just about everything.\n\nIn particular when tasks are running in the background. Which kind of makes multi-tasking an annoying experience. Try downloading apps and opening another program? Expect the Market to hang and stop responding. I think there's just too much going on with this high-res screen than what the Tegra 3 can effectively handle. If nothing else is running, navigating menus and scrolling is nice and smooth.\n\nBrowsing sometimes takes a negative hit in speed depending on what it has to load. I often load the desktop version of sites. So when there is a lot of rich content to display, I often found myself sitting at a blurry or partially loaded screen while it tried to load everything up. If you're a bit more patient with it and completely wait for the page to load, there are fewer issues with the browser hanging.\n\nBrowsing has never been perfect on the Android platform, regardless of browser, but trying to push a higher resolution with only slightly faster hardware doesn't help. Is it usable and playable? Yes, of course. But it just feels like a step backwards in terms of overall performance from the earlier lower res Android tablets. And sad to say, not quite up to the \"non-android\" competition.\n\nBENCHMARKS:\n\nThese aren't super impressive compared to the lower spec'd A700. Although I tend to focus on more real-world use, they are a good to have for certain comparisons.\n\nQuantum Standard 2.1.1: 4581\n\nCF Bench v1.2 Overall: 4301\n\nAnTuTu Benchmark v2.8.3\nTotal: 10777\nCPU: 6821\nGPU: 1301\nRAM: 2000\nI/O: 655\n\nSmartbench 2012: 3933\n\nVellamo Mobile Web Benchmark v1.0.6: 1480\n\nWIRELESS:\n\nASUS took a lot of criticism with poor wireless and virtually no internal GPS functionality with the TF201. As expected that has been resolved thanks to the plastic strip at the top of the back cover. I can get as good if not better wireless reception at the other side of my house than what most of my notebooks can manage.\n\nBefore even going outside to find some satellites, I fired up 'GPS Test' inside the house next to a window and within a few seconds already found a dozen satellite and narrowed my location down to around 30 ft. This is how GPS is supposed to work. Going outside of course improved this quite a bit.\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nYes, as noted before, there is only one. For a single speaker, it really isn't all that bad. It provides reasonably decent sound for it's size and what is basically horrible placement. It's on the back, exactly where your right hand is going to cover it up (or when placed on a flat surface). With games and system sounds, the sound volume is acceptable and quality is just OK.\n\nHowever, there are no user controlled audio adjustments or volume boost functionality added in from ASUS. So when watching movies and videos, I found the audio to be much lower than I'd like. Making it almost difficult at times to make out what was being said. After hearing considerably louder and higher quality speakers (and better placement) from Toshiba and Acer, that is a little disappointing.\n\nI suspect you could find an app to boost the volume. You can only do so much with a single poorly placed speaker. I've said it before, and I'll say it again. Speakers need to be on the front of your tablet. :)\n\nCAMERA & BATTERY:\n\nI usually don't even bother mentioning the camera on a tablet since I'm rarely ever going to use it. In particular since they are normally such poor quality, you wouldn't want to. However, I was surprised at the quality of the 8MP camera on this device. Both videos and still shots look crisp and detailed, with a good color balance.\n\nWell, at least in good lighting conditions. And I always like to see the LED flash, as I'm probably more likely to use that than the camera itself. They are bright and quite useful when you need some quick light. The front 2MP camera is decent enough for video chat.\n\nThe battery, as expected, lost some run time compared with the TF201. There's more screen to push and higher speeds to deal with. I was looking at about roughly 7 hours of battery life with moderate to heavy usage. With my \"normal\" usage that involves browsing and an occasional video or game here and there, I could easily go 2 days without a charge. So that's never been a huge deal for me.\n\nPRO'S:\n+ Very nice HD Super IPS+ Display\n+ Nice form factor\n+ Functional GPS/Wi-Fi\n+ Included cleaning cloth\n+ Optional Keyboard Dock\n+ Corning Gorilla Glass 2\n+ Good 8MP Camera (with LED)\n\nCONS:\n- Performance Issues\n- LCD Banding*\n- Speaker/audio quality\n- Loose glass fitment*\n- Build Quality\n- No Micro-USB Port\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nMany will quickly dismiss these negatives either because it doesn't bother them or they don't notice it. Or maybe hold out for a future update to help out with some performance issues (ie. Android 4.1 \"Jelly Bean\"). Which I really can't blame them as there is a lot to like about the TF700. Especially that nice looking high-res display and great form factor.\n\nAs somebody who has been in various fields of the IT industry for 20 years, I've seen both sides to this equation. On one side I understand how and why these things happen, and in some cases, I'm even willing to live with them. Then again, as a consumer who spent $500 (+ tax!) on a top-of-the-line tablet, I tend to be less forgiving.\n\nAt the end of the day, it does come down to what I'm willing to accept for my hard earned dollars. And as much as I personally wanted to love this TF700, as the device is out of the box, the negatives simply outweigh the positives. And that's just the bottom line for me.\n\n*** 2ND TF700 UPDATE 7/19 ***\nThe second tablet arrived sooner than expected. Unfortunately, as I suspected, it has all of the same issues the first one had. Loose glass panel fitment and LCD banding. Performance is also the same. No significant changes in initial benchmarks.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the performance isn't horrible. Just not what I'm expecting for a tablet in this class. OS updates can potentially help in the future. But build quality and LCD issues, not so much.\n\nAnd for those keeping track, these were both \"C60KASxxxx\" serial numbers."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008F4NL18", "review": "I've only had this tablet for a day, but so far it seems like one of the best tablets out.  The few cons are that the bezel is a little wide, but the device is so thin that it's not a big deal and there is one spot on mine about an inch below the power button where you can push in on the bezel and hear it click.  I bought the SquareTrade ADH (accidental damage and handling) warranty with it and I'm glad I did because of this.  I can't use the warranty until that issue causes some performance problems (which it may if dust or water gets in there).  Also as mentioned in a later review for some reason it doesn't have a 5Ghz wifi radio.  That is sort of disappointing as even my Galaxy Nexus supports 5Ghz.\n\nThe rest of the device is solidly built and it is fast.  I was originally looking to get the Acer A700 as I got the wife the A100 back in February, however the heat issues mentioned in the A700 reviews worried me.  This device stays cool.  I even watched the Reds game using MLBatBat and there was no noticeable heat.  A case is highly recommended though as it's a little difficult to hold since it's so thin.  For the $50 difference I'm glad I went with the Asus over the Acer."}
