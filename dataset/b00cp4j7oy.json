{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00CP4J7OY", "review": "We have been enthusiastic purchasers of Leapfrog products for many years.  My three boys, ages 9, 7 and 5 have loved the games for the Leapster Explorer and the Leapster before that.  Sadly, after purchasing the LeapPad2 at an American Base Commissary overseas, I learned that Leapfrog does not allow individuals to purchase apps online for their LeapPad products from overseas - even if one has an American Military/Diplomatic post office address in the United States.  Specifically, they do not allow for input of APO/DPO addresses when you try to input your credit card information on their App Store online.\n\nFor those of us who serve overseas, this is unfortunately a familiar problem.  I thought I would be able to correct it with a friendly phone call to Leapfrog customer service.  Here's what happened instead.  I spent 33 minutes waiting on hold for Leapfrog customer service on an international phone call before I finally gave up.  The second day, I spent another 15 minutes on hold before reaching a representative who told me that they do not support credit card payments online for credit cards with APO/DPO billing addresses.  I figured that she didn't have the power to do anything and politely asked to speak to a manager.\n\nDenise the Customer Service Manager replied that the company indeed would not support an APO/DPO credit card and could not take the order manually with a credit card number over the phone.  After noting that Leapfrog sold these app-dependent products overseas at locations where online service is necessary, she apologized and said there was nothing to be done but buy a \"Prepaid App Card\" at a local retailer like Walmart or Toys R Us.  Of course, these stores don't exist in the country in which I live which Denise verified.\n\nDenise said that she would talk to her superiors and either call or e-mail the next day with a solution.  But you guessed it - she did not - which is why this negative review exists.  I cannot recommend that Americans serving overseas purchase this new generation of Leapfrog products.  This is doubly a shame because I think the product is good and Leapfrog's website manager could correct this problem in about 15 minutes if the company really wanted to."}

I wanted something that she could learn with and not get onto the internet.  She was able to enjoy it from the first moment I gave it to her.  I also wanted something that would help her in school.  I love the games that are so much fun that kids don't know they are really learning."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00CP4J7OY", "review": "As with several other things I bought from LeapFrog before, this is an overpriced junk.\nThis toy comes with nothing on it. You have to buy everything from their \"App store\" where the cheapest game is $7.5 and most Apps are $25 each!\nA few Apps can cost you much more than this toy. The resolution on the screen is very low, something similar to toys from the 90s !\nI will return this junk and would recommend something that is Android based toy so you can downland free Apps."}

You have to be kidding, four rechargeable batteries = $50. What did a government contractor bid this for LeapFrog? I can not and will not support a company who has a business model that has you basically buying a new device every time their power pack wears out. I love the device and so does my daughter but I need people to see that buying the power pack is (IMHO) a waste of money and people should be letting the company know this."}

This was a 5 star review, BUT the rechargeable batteries is what sold this for me, but after only a few months, the battery pack quit working, LeapFrog is refusing to honor the warranty, and they suggested I repurchase the $70-80 rechargeable battery pack. NO THANK YOU. We'll take apart the battery packs and just recharge the batteries inside with our own wall charger. There's a YouTube video to show you how to do it.\n\nI LOVE that this particular package came with the rechargeable batteries. It's what sold it, to be honest. Our old one (same model) finally quit working after 5 years of sometimes rough handling (thrown on floor in frustration, tossed into bedroom, stepped on, etc.) It saw two children through rather rough patches of 2-4 year old child use. We happily purchased this new one and has honestly paid for itself with the ability to plug it in, and as our 2nd 4 year old can plug it in herself, she's taking better care if it than she did with her sister's old one."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00CP4J7OY", "review": "My daughter used this most when she was four and five. Every now and then she will still get it back out (she's 7 now), even though we haven't got any new games for it in a couple years. She never spent a lot of time on it. She got a little bored after about 15 minutes or so, but still continued to use it. I think most of the games are challenging enough for the age group. Now that there are better kid appropriate tablets available (like the Kids Fire--no I don't make money off promoting it), I would probably get that instead. There are more gaming options in Freetime (for the Fire) and the games are free (at least for a year, not sure what the renewal price is). Most of the games for the LeapPad are affordable and able to be downloaded directly to the device, which is nice, so you don't have a bunch of cartridges getting lost. I like that most of the games are educational. It makes you feel less guilty for letting your kids have screen time. :)"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00CP4J7OY", "review": "I bought this for my 3 year old daughter for Christmas and she has absolutely loved it. She wanted her own tablet like her big sissy had, so we decided on this one because of the age appropriate design, content and ease of use. It came with the battery pack for extended play if we are going to be away from home for a while, as well as a plug in battery. I'm glad all this came together instead of having to buy it separately. The apps that came with the tablet were great starting apps for her to get used to the tablet and she loves the drawing app the most. It also has a camera, and calculator. The front facing camera is great for her to take pics of herself and not have to worry about coordinating the back facing camera. The front facing camera is very easy for her to use. You can also add effects to the pics. The LeapFrog leap pad comes with a USB that you plug directly into your computer and through this you register and can buy games and apps and download them directly to your device, which is a very easy process. We have downloaded lots of games that she loves like Little Mermaid, Bubble Guppies, Astro Blast, Sesame Street and a few learning games which have really helped her with her vocabulary and letter recognition. The sound is great and is easy to adjust. What I love the most is the durability and rugged construction of the device. She has dropped it twice and there was no damage to the device at all. She is 3 so she isn't always the most responsible with her gadgets, which is why we went with this device over anything too expensive. The screen is still scratch free and no cracks or chips are present anywhere. Overall, this has been a fantastic learning tool for my little one and for the price has given her her very own tablet that provides hours of fun and learning on car rides, doctors visits, or just playing it at home. We love the tablet and would recommend it to anyone with a child around the 3-6 age range."}

They will not repair any products that have a crack in the screen...they tell you that they are trash at that point...even if it happens a week after you buy it! Apparently it voids the warranty...kids can easily crack the screen just so know! Also after the company had me erase all the apps on my leap pad they refused to replace them! Yes, I will repeat that, the company instructed me on doing a repair, that ended up erasing all the apps on the leap pad, including the apps that came with the leappad when we bought it.  I could easily get the apps I purchased back, however the apps that came with the leappad when I got it new were gone and I was literally told by a supervisor that it was my fault because I was the one who asked them for assistance to fix a problem I was having with the leap pad (that was only 4 months old)! After spending hours on the phone over a 3 day span, I was told they would NOT replace the apps THEY had me erase! It was 11 apps all together they had me erase and then refused to replace....I AM AN HONEST PERSON AND WOULD ONLY EVER WRITE A REVIEW LIKE THIS IF I REALLY FELT I NEEDED TO TRY AND SAVE OTHER PARENTS FROM EXPERIENCING THE MOST HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED FROM ANY COMPANY EVER....AND I AM IN THE SERVICE INDUSTRY!"}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00CP4J7OY", "review": "I purchased this item for my granddaughter for her last birthday. Sept 2014. This year I thought to buy her games since she never had any. I purchased the games and they don't work in this leap pad  I tried them in my other granddaughters and the games work. I googled what to do and I followed all the helpful hints but to no avail it still does not work. I realize I probably don't have warranty but it's just disappointing. I wish I tried the game cartridge earlier. All we get is a red x I would appreciate any help we could get. These children cannot afford such luxuries so they depend on me. It's sad that she was so excited to get games and now saddened as she cannot play them. Thank you"}

We invested over $299 with the LeapPad2, accessories, games, and apps for it to malfunction just 1.5 years later with no water damage or drop damage to the device. In fact one day it just wouldn't turn on-the problem lying with the internal system of the tablet not the charging ports or batteries-very poor quality for something so expensive and to last 1.5 years-I certainly hope your future products come with better internal capabilities-for that kind of money-you are better off to buy an \"adult\" brand tablet  for your child-at least it would work longer than a year and a half......"}

If it did turn on, it would be randomly after my son gave up on it 30 minutes earlier.  We called Leapfrog and they did replace it, which was nice. However, the new one only worked for less than a week before it started doing the same thing - not turning on. Very disappointed and would not recommend.

She has dropped it on hard floors (and even once in the snow!) more times than I'd like to admit, and it has held up perfectly (just some scratches in the pink paint on the corners). We don't even have a protective sleeve on it. It shuts off when it takes a fall, but turns back on as if nothing happened. No cracked screen or damaged memory or anything. For this alone, I believe this product deserves 5 stars. It's true that the games are a bit expensive, even with sales/promo codes, but she seems to enjoy them and even learn from some of them, and I believe she will get use out of them for the next year or two at minimum.\n\nGreat distraction at the doctors office, restaurant, grocery store, on car trips, or even just at home for some peaceful playtime."}

Sure you get one game with the tablet, but they limit you to 3 choices and truly NONE of them worked for my daughter.

I found online that many parents have the same problem as mine. The screen of the pad is so easy to be broken! Many cases just like mine, the pad was in a backpack and unknown reason, it was broken!\nThis is a kid device and expensive. You even have no way to fix it! I fixed my laptop screen, but for this tiny device I even can not find an screen online to replace it by myself.\nIf you call the company, they will provide you 25% to buy a new one. But even with 25% discount,it is not worth to buy again! First online you can easily find cheaper price for this device! And this is an old model, I bought it with case, apps in a bundle last year even cheaper than now after the 25% discount offer! I did bought lots apps too, but it may not fit in new model!  No way!\n I do not care about the apps I bought now. Once you buy a new one, the kid may broken it again. Consider spend hundreds dollars and kid will be soon old enough to be tired with the small screen pad within 1-2 years. It is totally not worth.  Now there is much more options in the market other than leapfrog. We have two ipads at home and the kids like them very much. I used to plan to buy paw patrol apps from leapfrog for my son as DOB gift. Now I will buy some apps on apple store instead. Far better!\nThe company's customer service are not serious you. Think about it. If you want to buy it at low price, the device may broken in 1 year. Once it is broken, you need to buy a new one. While if you buy directly from leapfrog, you can get a better warranty. But with the price, you can buy a far better pads (better screen and faster cpu, longer battery). Oh, forget to mention that if you use batteries for the pad. It will use up very quickly, within hours. This is not a good option. Don't be stupid as me."}

Also it said this would not be delivered to a p.o. box but I ended up having to pick it up at the post office anyways.... Anyway the leap pad looks great and I'm excited for my son to play with it. I really like the color of it. Looks just like the picture shows on here."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00CP4J7OY", "review": "I saw this in a local store for 50% off, and I couldn't pass it up.  My son is just shy of 2.5 and received it today as an early Christmas/desperation gift because his dad and I were out of options to entertain him this weekend.  You may snark at this, or you may nod and laugh, but it is what it is.  Needless to say, he loves the gift.  He quite literally could not put it down, and threw an epic tantrum when we made him take a break.\n\nPrior to seeing this in the store, I had no intention of buying him any kind of tablet and I had no knowledge of this product.  I must say I made a good choice on a whim.  I don't usually make toy purchases without reading reviews first, but this tablet is a great toy for kids who just don't get much out of the other toddler tech toys like Leap Frog's \"My Own Laptop\", which is rated for 3-5 years according to the package.  We had that one, but my son was only interested in it for about 5 minutes.\n\nWhat I like about this tablet is that it DOES NOT HAVE WIFI.  Some parents may want WIFI, but I think for a kid this young it is highly unnecessary and even a bad idea.  There is simply nothing he can do to get himself or us into trouble with this.  No chance of buying apps without permission, no stumbling on websites he's not allowed to see, no advertisements.  Perfect.  The games themselves are pretty pricey, but I like the cartridge format.  I realize you can buy them in the Leap Frog app store, but I like the cartridges for resale options if my son doesn't like them.  So far I have purchased 3 games, 2 of which he has opened, and 1 of which he is gaga over.  I also purchased him an ebook and a music album from the online store.  I love that you can use Paypal to purchase the apps.  It makes it super easy.\n\nThe stylus is handy and helps my son learn to grip a pencil the correct way.  Already on the first day I have seen improvement there.  The touchscreen does work without the stylus for most applications.  My son is a little rough with the stylus.  If you have a younger kid, you might invest in a screen protector.  I intend to get one to protect the screen.  We also have the gel skin, which I recommend if you have this \"power\" version with the battery packs, as it could get annoying to have to remove the skin every time you change batteries.  I'm not sure the skin will protect in the case of drops, but it will protect against scratches and other misuse.\n\nThe interface is very easy. My son grasps the concept of the games very well, and although he can't play all the games without help, I'm sure it won't be long before he masters them.  For this reason, I recommend sticking to the 3 year age recommendation.  It really would have been better at 3.  My son is smart enough, but not really mature enough to use this.  There were several reviewers who stated that they gave this to their kid younger than 3, so I took the chance.  I wish I would have waited.\n\nStartup of the tablet is fast.  You do have to choose your profile every time you sign in, even if you only have 1 profile loaded.  The apps also load fast, which is good since my son has zero patience.\n\nThe apps included with the tablet are sort of lame.  He does like PetPad quite a bit.  I'm not sure the calculator or the clock will ever get used.  The notepad seems like it would be for kids that would be much older, and would no longer find this tablet entertaining.  The camera is a nice feature, and one I'm sure my son will enjoy once he figures it out. The art studio appeared to be missing until we hooked up the tablet to the computer and downloaded it.  I'm not sure we will ever use the calendar either.  We also got to chose 1 free app, which ended up being a Scout and Violet game about emotions, the only one available for my son's age group.  There were 3 to choose from, and the other 2 were for older kids.  I'm not sure about the ebook, but the music I bought is pretty good and he likes it.  I think he will get more out of the ebook later.\n\nThe batteries seem to charge pretty fast.  There is no battery indicator, which is a little worrisome if we are traveling with this.\n\nOverall this device seems like a solid toy, and I think we are really going to enjoy it for waits at the doctor's office, long car rides, and times like this weekend when we just couldn't find anything else that would occupy him.  Prior to using this he had played on my iPhone and iPad several times, but only in situations where I was desperate to keep his attention (restaurants with long waits) and I never liked handing him something that expensive.  I have resisted buying him tech toys up until about 6 months ago, and I cannot justify buying him a grownup tablet at this age.  I feel this is a good compromise.  It's going to be hard to keep him off of it.\n\nOne more thing.  If you are buying this for Christmas, I recommend unpacking it and setting everything up beforehand.  My little guy could barely contain himself while I inserted the batteries and downloaded everything.  (downloads are kind of slow for larger files, i.e. games)  You'd be smart to get everything set up and charged before the handoff.  It's going to be a showstopper for sure.  We are now glad we did it before the big day, as it would have distracted from any other gifts and activities on Christmas!"}

He is very gentle with the item, but it appears the screen is VERY fragile as that is what has broken every time. I purchased the screen protector, the gel case, and keep the entire thing in the hard shell case with a zipper. Once the screen cracked while he was playing a game. The second time it took a 1 1/2 foot drop off our couch onto the carpet, and the final time I had the item packaged in all it's cases inside my purse. Somehow the screen cracked. I originally purchased a protection plan so I haven't had to repay to replace the item. I think we will save up some money and buy a mini iPad. Our son plays with my iPad all the time and that's never broken. I only wish the games that come with the LeapFrog were available through the Apple Store. They are wonderful games and my son really enjoyed playing them."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00CP4J7OY", "review": "I want to give it four stars, but I have to go with three because we've had too many \"hiccups\" in our first few days with the device. First, our daughter is left-handed. Both the LeapPad and its games were designed for right-handed children. There are two options for attaching the stylus, both are on the right side. What this means is that in portrait mode, the cord from the stylus either hangs diagonally across the screen or awkwardly behind or in front of the bottom buttons, and the cord is too short either way (I'll replace it with something, but that shouldn't be necessary). In landscape mode, using the stylus with a left hand covers up much of the screen as the games are laid out to be right-hand friendly (meaning stylus activity is often on the right side of the screen). If this were the first LeapPad to be designed I could almost forgive this short-sightedness, but a quick google shows customers have had this complaint for years. I find it really annoying that the problem still exists.\n\nSecond, forgive me but I have an old laptop, running XP. You have to install the LeapFrog software on your computer to load anything onto the device. I would have appreciated a warning that the software was going to (1) not function, and (2) force me to spend half a day trying to repair all the damage it did to my formerly well-oiled machine. It caused a lot of problems (I can't even shut my machine down now, or run a system restore.) I'm going to have to borrow a computer anytime I need to load stuff onto/remove stuff from the LeapPad or shop on the LeapFrog store. And to think I didn't want WiFi.\n\nThird, I would like to see a little more control over the device preferences. In some situations, the screen is entirely too bright and it is not adjustable, and the lowest volume setting is anything but quiet. There's an art app and a pet app that come pre-installed, both of which have tutorial-type directions that NEVER STOP. It tells you how to play once, then any time the stylus is motionless for two seconds, the voice starts up again. It's a little confusing for a three year old, way annoying for mommy and totally unnecessary. I'm praying the purchased apps don't do the same thing.\n\nThe device is also capable of playing music, but you have to purchase an mp3 player for it. I think it was $5. I know the apps are expensive, but this really makes me feel like we're going to be nickel and dimed.\n\nWe got the LeapPad because we love the LeapFrog movies and expected to love the LeapPad apps as much. The experience has been a bigger letdown than I ever expected. I hope we grow to love it, and I'll update my review if my opinion changes one way or another.\n\nBy the way, if you're shopping for one, check prices whenever you can. I've been to this page four times in three days and the prices jump around between $50 and $80 quite often. Also, never pay full price for apps through the LeapFrog store. Sales rotate constantly.\n\n*EDIT I forgot to mention, Alphabet Stew, one of the first apps we bought, which is similar to Boggle (find words in a grid of letters) is ...well, wrong. The very first puzzle we played denies \"log\" and \"dam\" are words. SO confusing and irresponsible for a game that's supposed to teach children! I'm afraid I'm going to have to remove a star for that one. I'm losing faith in this company."}

They could not resolve my problem and instead of escalating the situation, they ended the call and told me they would follow up with an email.  Anyone that has a 4 year old knows that this is not acceptable.  The call should not have ended until the situation was resolved.  The email that was sent was less than helpful and I am still having issues each and every time I attempt to purchase and download a new game.  It is extremely time consuming."}

This actually turned out to be my favorite feature. The tablet has a built in camera, recorder, and art program and you can download their art, pictures, and videos. It is so fun to see the art and photography from a three year old mind, and they have made some really cool artwork! I debated and researched forever because the apps can be pricey and there are many tablets to choose from. The decision maker for me was the fact that every app is educational and can span a variety of ages. They have some free apps and some kid apps on my Kindle, but it is a toss up as to how much learning they get from them. I have not been disappointed in a single app, yet. If you want something for 2-6yr old kids, I recommend this one. I even find myself preaching it to strangers in the toy aisle! I would, however, get the rechargeable pack.

Also, the rechargeable battery is completely worth the investment. Our LeapPad2 charges quickly, effectively, and provides a large amount of play time.\n\nIf I could leave just one word of advice it would be to please get a bigger screen. Knowing the product's capability, it's almost laughable that they still have such a tiny screen area."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00CP4J7OY", "review": "The Item was as expected this is our second one of these and the only reason we purchased this one is because we already had quite a few games. Our last one had a screen defect and shattered we honestly have no idea how it was fine in a protective case when my son left for school when he came home and went to play it he found the screen broken. We tried to get it fixed and Leapfrog has the WORST customer care for items like this. It doesnt matter how a screen is broken if it is there fault or not warrenty void. They REFUSE to supply even for purchase replacement screens and it is such a waste when the unit still works but the screen won't because of a small brake. This will be our last if this brakes LeapFrog will not be getting any more money from us. I have Tried for 6 years to work with there support and there answer is always the same they loose our info they are REALLY hard to get on the phone and they won't help you if you do. They will only talk by email and most of the time there answers are little to no help anyway and it take four or five days for them to respond. So in short was is item as expected yes. the Coupons inside are expired and you cannot transfer information from your old unit to the new so you are better off buying cartridges because only three units can share a game and guess what if your unit brakes it and you get a new one it counts as a shared unit. They will not replace games that are downloaded and lost even though it is there program that erased them. and there online system is good at that."}

I have a nephew who has one of these, so I'm already familiar with how much kids love it. It's slightly too advanced for my soon-to-be 2 year old, but he loves playing games on his siblings tablets, so we got him this as a starter tablet. We're going out of town soon and didn't have time to look around. We decided to get this today (Sunday) with hopes of receiving it by Monday morning or evening at the latest (leaving on Tuesday). To my surprise Amazon had this option to receive this item by today (Sunday), by no later than 9 pm for a VERY minimal price. Of course this made me skeptical as  I insisted this was impossible to happen on a Sunday. But since the price of this event to happen was so low I figured it was worth a try. So, I went ahead and placed the order at 11 am with a mind full of doubt. Guess what showed up at my door at 6p? My kid's new LeapPad! What a great service you guys provide. I can't be more appreciative. And so does my kids who no longer have to worry about having their tablets stolen by their baby brother."}

My daughter plays on this for hours which I don't mind because they are educational games and apps. We have purchased movies in the App Store and my daughter watches her movies when we are going for car rides and sometimes in the stroller.\nThis came with the battery pack, 2 stylus pens, $20 app card and power adapter. The power adapter we received with this is different then the power adapter you buy at the store which is great. We have not had any issues with this power adapter at all. We have three older kids that had leappads and we bought the power adapters for them from the store which were round instead of this rectangular one, ALL of them stopped working within the first three months of use. We purchased this leappad for our daughter for Christmas 2013 and this power adapter has been used daily since then with NO issues!!\nThe battery pack which is included is excellent. No more needing to replace batteries every couple hours and no need to sit by the wall and play it while it is plugged in without batteries. The battery pack seems to last much longer then the regular batteries did!\n\nJust be aware that you can only put purchased apps,music,movies on up to 3 devices. That's one downfall to this whole leapfrog system/world but this leappad is great!"}

No wifi, and the screen is lo-res, so if your kid has never seen a smartphone or tablet and does not interact with other kids, you could lie and tell them it's modern technology.

They insert different characters but the tasks are very similar. The camera stopped working on it after a year and a half, which seems like a short life span for a semi-expensive electronic item that even after the initial cost you are investing $20-$25 bucks a pop to add the better games to it. Also add the money spent by giving it rechargeable batteries, a gel protective cover and a case. My daughter loved using the camera with the creativity studio, but sorry kid, doesn't work anymore and it's after the 12 month warranty so you're out of luck. LeapFrog offered me a 25% discount to buy another one. Why would I be so dumb to buy another one? Then there is the issue with the connect software. Most of the time it goes into \"not responding\" mode when it's hooked up to the computer. My daughter uses my Galaxy tab that's been going strong for years and there are tons of free items at her disposal, even free kindle books instead of the $5-$7.50 e-books LeapFrog is pushing.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00CP4J7OY", "review": "Okay, so this is actually our third LeapPad as the two older kids also have LeapPads.\n\nFirst, the positives:  the kids enjoy playing on these, they don't love them, but they do like them.  They are especially useful on road trips where they can keep occupied for an hour or so.  Many of the apps/games are educational which is obviously a plus.  And you can plug the LeapPad into your PC to see what they have been playing and track their progress.  Some people may list as a negative, but I like there is no wifi or internet connectivity on this device.  They have plenty of years to play on the net....for now, I appreciate limited access to it.\n\nNow the negatives:  the games/pass get expensive.  Yes, there are apps you can download for $3 or so.  But there are many for $20-$25, and some of them are glorified e-books.  We have three of these in our house, and two screens have now cracked, presumably during a drop.  Now, these were not abused, and not even used that much, and two of three screens....cracked.  LeapPads website clearly lists this product for 3-9 year olds.  If they have not been designed and proven to resist drops, then this is a MAJOR defect.  So, this alone would cause me not to purchase another one.  However, it gets worse.  The first one broke about 2 months after receiving it.  Contact LeapFrog and they responded that they don't have anything in stock to replace it, so contact vendor.  I thought, two months later on a Manufacturer issue, not a vendor issue, how could that fly??  Contacted amazon, and they sent a replacement LeapPad....wow, now that is top notch customer service!  Thanks, five stars to Amazon.  Fast forward to our third LeapPad purchase (we should have learned after the first crack)......and again about 2 months after purchase, cracked screen.  I contact LeapPad asking for a replacement screen, repair or replacement product.  They respond with an offer to purchase a discount LeapPad.  They state they do not cover accidents or misuse.......really, how is a 3-year old supposed to use this product??  It is going to get dropped, that is a fact.  If the screens are not durable enough to handle it, which they are not, they should be marketing this product for 9-12 year olds.  Bottom line is poor customer service, LeapPad doesn't stand behind their product, and I refuse to purchase another LeapFrog product ever again.  I am tired of companies making inferior products over in China, raking in a lot of money and not standing behind the product."}

I spent over $211.95 purchasing the leap pad 2 princess bundle and the Disney Super Games Bundle.  Im not sure how much it was for each, but it was less than two years ago.  Apparently now they are way cheaper too, but thats how it goes.  My daughter is in the age group it was designed for, and over the last two years I have purchased numerous games, accessories, and the battery recharger pack.  Unfortunately prior to our vacation she decided to pack the charger in the case with the leap pad, and the screen broke.  I called leap frog to see if I could purchase a replacement screen, or send it some place where I could pay to have it repaired.  They informed me that they dont/wont do that, and that my only option was to purchase a new one.  I think it is absurd to market an item to five year olds that is fragile, and cant be fixed.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00CP4J7OY", "review": "While these tablets are educational, I would not recommend them to anyone. The screens are VERY fragile...much more so than any other tablet or cell phone's glass screen. They are a very thin plastic, and they cannot be replaced by the company. I bought my daughter's (she is 3 now) for Christmas 2013 and when the screen shattered, I looked it up online and saw this is a very common issue. Most said to contact the company and they would do a one time replacement. I did that, and after being told initially I could buy one at shop price for half price (I paid less on the pre-black friday deal I got it on), I had to be firm that this is a tablet made for children and they needed to replace it. They did replace it, and just a few weeks later that one shattered to. My daughter is not rough on them, at least no more than any other 3 year old (and probably less as she loves her tablet). They simply are cheaply made. For a company who specializes in children's toys, they need to somehow correct this problem!\n\nIn addition, while my daughter can play many games on my android tablet with no problem, and can navigate it to find her apps (and has been doing so since she under two), this is far less user friendly for children her age even though it is designed for her age. She could find her movies, but playing the games even intended for her age was a bit difficult."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00CP4J7OY", "review": "this tablet is so versatile as a learning tool and as entertainment for long car rides! I like that it does not have wifi, as I don't want my kids bathed in the extra signal at this point. The leappad2 has a big enough screen, without being too big, in my opinion.  The battery pack lasts a long time. The apps add up, but each one is quite an investment.(so choose wisely!) ex. do you really want your child to be able to waste their learning time watching the spongebob? but then again, you can load on the content you want them to have, WHEN you want them to have it. Like, put on the purely entertaining stuff for long car trips. When you are at home and want to give it to them for 30 min, you know they have all educational content to choose from. I just tell my kids, all the apps can't fit at the same time. They don't mind, and the changing content makes it more interesting. I don't get much out of \"seeing\" their progress online, but I do look over their shoulders and watch when they are playing. Some of the games are so fun, I will take a turn! As far as the prices go, I think they are pretty fair... And if you buy the app cards on amazon when they are on sale, and then wait till leapfrog has a sale on apps, you can get great deals. (imagine, spend $15 on the app card worth $20, then buy the apps when they are 30% off... you can get 3 $10 apps for $16!! and have $4 of credit left over. Sometimes there are even better deals. When the app card price dips, you can pick up a few, then wait for the app center deals. Also, its even more of a deal if you have more than one tablet, because the apps can be uploaded to up to 3 devices. So it's already 2 for one. the apps are way better than the cartridges because they can't get lost or damaged, and both kids can play them at the same time for the same price.\nAnother tip I will add, is do not allow your child to bite on the end of the stylus, because it can get sharp and scratch the screen. Also the tether can get chewed through and then the stylus lost.\nI really appreciate the leappad2 for what it is, and do not have interest in the Ultra. Though over the next few years I predict all the new apps will be for only Ultra, and may be pretty cool... i could change my mind! but by then I imagine my kids will have moved on."}

This was unfortunate as I had already paid for all kinds of things to be loaded to the device.  Now I have to risk buying a battery charger with new batteries and risk the same problem.

The rechargeable battery pack also saves on endless batteries that normally would be used up keeping it powered up for all of the activity it gets with my kids.  The only drawback is you have to buy all apps for it.  There is no \"free\" apps like with an android or ipad system (except one app that comes with the unit that can be downloaded from a small list).  Overall it is an excellent tablet for little hands."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00CP4J7OY", "review": "These Leappad products are definitely kid proof. This model has replaceable and rechargeable batteries which is nice. The Ultra version batteries are not user replaceable which is a big downside of that model. Battery life is good, I'd guess about 10 hours or so. Our son uses them on long car trips without them losing power.\n\nWe have two Leap Pads. One is this LeapPad2 model and the other is the Ultra (free to us as Vine members). As far as the product itself they are fine and the biggest advantage of them is they are very sturdy and kid proof. Our 4-year-old son has put them both through the test, hitting the screen very hard with the stylus, getting the screen wet and putting his food covered fingers on the screen. They clean up and perform perfectly.\n\nThe apps are mostly pretty good, one big advantage is they are voice directed so if the little on can't read they still can use the apps. I must say our 4-year-old learned the alphabet by himself with the LeapPad in about a week.\n\nThe really big downside, and the one that makes me mark it two stars, is the apps are way too expensive. Some can be had for about $5 but they are far from the best apps. Many of them are $25. Yes you can often find sales but that takes 10-20% off the price reducing the $25 apps down to perhaps $20 - still very expensive.\n\nIn an era when you can buy a 7\" tablet (not kid proof) for under $100 and load it up with good apps which are anywhere from free to $5 I just can't see spending the outrageous prices for the leap apps. I'm guessing it is a matter of volume. If LeapFrog sold in huge volume like tablet apps do then the prices might come down.\n\nPurchase a dozen apps for the LeapPad and you've likely spent upwards of $200.\n\nWe have purchased a few apps for the LeapPad but tend to buy way less expensive apps for our smartphones and let our son play with them. The LeapPad is used less and less now. We will likely buy our son a 7\" tablet next."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00CP4J7OY", "review": "The Leappad 2 Power is functionally identical to the standard (and cheaper) Leappad 2 tablet, but for the inclusion of a rechargeable battery kit and charger that Leapfrog also sells separately. The compelling advantage of Leapfrog's kit is that the batteries can be recharged in the unit, unlike conventional AA rechargeable batteries, which would need to be removed first. While it seems a money grab initially, the design prevents the inadvertent (and unsafe) recharging of alkaline batteries. In a pinch, alkaline or rechargeable AA batteries can be swapped into the unit.\n\nWe bought the Leappad for our 4 year old son for Christmas. This is a great toy for the younger end of the recommended 4-9 year old age range. Older kids, or kids who've previously had much exposure to \"grown-up\" Apple or Android devices are unlikely to find this a compelling alternative. That said, all the content available for it is of good educational value, and without the advertising or in-app purchases so common on iOS and Android devices. Games and apps can be \"installed\" via interchangeable cartridges, or purchased on-line and downloaded into the unit's internal memory, which is sufficient to hold a couple dozen apps at the same time, and without risk of your little one losing the carts.\n\nThe overall build quality is excellent, with commendable display and sound quality, given the selling price. Both cameras are trash VGA resolution affars that perform atrociously in low light conditions, but are commendable relative to the selling price of the unit. The unit is also suitably ruggedized for the child demographic it is targeted at, and includes thoughtful design touches as a stylus that is tethered, and which easily stores in a niche on the side of the unit. Leapfrog sells a series of rubber cases for these that add an additional layer of protection inexpensively."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00CP4J7OY", "review": "Not going to write a detailed evaluation but I would say ultimately this is a decent purchase overall. The battery lasts pretty long (so far). The design is pretty simple for young ones to figure out. It's basically a simplified touch pad learning device. The speed is fast. Load up and shutdown is great. Not sure why we have to pay for the battery charger adapter as an extra accessory. Just about every other product would include this free. so that is kind of lame. The screen resolution is pretty bad as well. For $100 I don't expect \"retina display\" but I did expect better than what this screen offers. Like-wise, the camera feature, although very fun for children, looks like the old 2 megapixel cellphone cameras from 10 years ago. You pretty much need direct sunlight to get a decent snapshot. More importantly, my child is enjoying this product very much. I got this as an alternative to watching TV. There are lots of game cartridges that feature the popular shows on Disney, etc.. so this is a healthier alternative to watching the tube because it is interactive. I would recommend it."}

At $290 you could just buy your toddler an iPad and put it in a rugged case!! Could you imagine all of the apps on iTunes at $10? Would you have downloaded Angry Birds if it would of cost you $19.95?

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00CP4J7OY", "review": "I am so happy we decided to get this! We have an ipad, which our older kids play on often. Our 2 1/2 year old always wants to play on the ipad, but it's usually being used and not to mention, the games that are on there for him, he lost interest in because they are either geared towards babies or towards kindergarten and up. The LeapPad 2 solved that problem! It's very easy for him to use (his 7 year old sister even likes to use it from time to time) and we were even able to put an episode of his favorite show for him.\n\nA couple of things you want to keep in mind before buying is that you will want the LeapPad 2 POWER. Do not get the regular or you will be replacing batteries left and right. With the power, it comes with a charging cord and chargeable batteries. Also, to access the App Store, you have to go to the leap frog website. Each app costs money (about $4-6). You can also buy cartridges for it for around $25, and the cartridge does come with more features then the apps. It does come with some preloaded apps, which are enough to keep your little one interested, but be prepared to spend a little more in the future on apps, shows, and/or cartridges to keep them interested in it.\n\nWe did not buy ours from amazon, we bought it from eBay (it was brand new in the box and we paid $50). It was well worth the money!"}

In the box, I found the following items:\n\n-Doc McStuffins Themed LeapPad\n-Rechargeable Battery Pack\n-Charger\n-$20 App Card\n-Two Extra Styluses in Pink and Purple.\n\nSet up was a little difficult. You have to download a program from LeapFrog's website. The program installed on my computer easily, but when I was installing apps, it kept losing the connection to the LeapPad. Finally, I was able to get it to go through, but it took about an hour.\n\nThe LeapPad itself is great. My child has hurled it across the room, and it is sturdy and does not break (wouldn't recommend trying this, but two-year-olds and tantrums sometimes result in this effect).\n\nThe apps are a little expensive, but sometimes app cards are on sale, and LeapFrog also offers discounts on bundles and multi-app discounts.\n\nOverall, I would purchase this. LeapFrog has some excellent learning apps that are included and can be purchased. You can also purchase an app and install your own music."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00CP4J7OY", "review": "Our 6 year old son received the LeapPad2 Power for Christmas 2013. We chose LeapPad because the whole experience seems to be geared toward educational games and learning, it has a pretty huge library of games and apps, and it is a pretty decent value compared to some other similar kid's tablets.\n\nWhile some of the WiFi enabled tablets looked pretty neat (giving the kid the ability to email you drawings, I think), we figured it would be overkill for our 6 year old's first tablet. We opted for the \"Power\" model with rechargeable batteries, because using the tablet in the car on long trips was a major reason we got him a tablet. We did not want to keep buying batteries whenever he was away from a power outlet.\n\nThe tablet came with only a tiny handful of apps and games. I was a little disappointed there was not more loaded on to it to begin with. Besides the camera, I think there was a doodle app, one game, and a bunch of useless things for kids like a notepad, etc. The games, books, and apps are a little more expensive than I thought they would be ($7 to $15 each). I really don't know how developers can create incredibly polished iPhone apps and charge $1 or $2 and Leap Frog's basic games cost $10. Could be due to licensing Disney characters.\n\nI will say that there is ample memory on the device, making cartridges unnecessary. So glad we don't have to keep track of a dozen small plastic game cartridges!\n\nI would say the device is pretty durable, but it does have some limitations. My son has dropped it a lot of times, and it keeps on working fine. However, I do think a soft, rubbery case is a good idea. Last week, my son told me that he broke the screen. It was shattered. I took a picture and sent it to Leap Frog support. They said they do not repair or replace screens, but they did offer me a 50% discount on a new unit. I think that's pretty fair, since it probably broke due to rough use (though my son tells me he wasn't being rough). We will be replacing it, since we probably paid the same for games and apps for the thing as we did for the device in the first place.\n\nOverall, we have been pretty satisfied with the device (even though the screen failed). We let our son play on it for about an hour a day and he really enjoys it."}

Though it wasn't recommended for her age group, she seems to understand the mechanics well. Her favorite (stock, included on the tablet) application is the Art Studio (art doo-dee-doo, as she calls it) gives her endless hours of enjoyment. We did run into an issue with the tablet not booting up properly and requesting that it be plugged in to the PC for maintenance, but after it downloaded a fairly large file (90Mb) the tablet rebooted itself and it started working again. I'm a little disappointed that the applications are mostly geared to older kids, though I do understand she falls short of the target age range. Most applications are fairly expensive as well, but I knew that before I bought the tablet. Overall, it works well and she enjoys it, what more could one ask for?"}

My daughter has a Vtech Innotab 3S, and she prefers the Leapfrog. The Leapfrog has a slightly smaller screen and body, and this makes it easier to hold, so she enjoys it more. Its also faster loading than the Innotab, and the camera works much better. My daughter doesn't have a lot of patience for slow devices, so the Leapfrog has definitely become her favorite.

One thing I can say about LeapPads is that the absence of WiFI is both an advantage and a disadvantage.  Being they are targeted for much smaller kids and primarily for education, without WiFI it is a safer device in terms of contents and the risk of getting viruses.  But without WiFI, it also limits the device's capability.  Specially annoying when you need to download a game or needs an update.  You will always need it to be plugged with a cable tethered to your PC.\n\nDifference between the regular LeapPad2 and LeapPad2 Power:\n- The biggest difference is the rechargeable batteries and AC power adapter\n- Calculator, Calendar, Note Pad and Clock.  My daughter is excited the most with the calc.\n\nComes with:\n- MicroUSB cable\n- 2 styluses\n- AC adapter\n- Rechargeable batteries\n\nPros:\n- No WiFI\n- Educational\n- Will also work with regular four double As\n- We have dropped it many times and still chugging-a-long\n- Rechargeable\n- Can play purchased movies from the LeapPad site.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00CP4J7OY", "review": "First off, I just assumed that this came with a Doc McStuffins game. To be clear, it does not. At the time of this review, this version costs about ten bucks more than the pink version. For the extra money, you get a few wallpapers and a couple of extra stylus plus a $20 download card. Im not sure how much use you will get out of the extra stylus as the stylus connects to the LeapPad. Generally, I would say that unless your child is a pretty hard-core Doc McStuffins fan, going with the plain pink LeapPad2 may be a better option.\nAs for the LeapPad itself, it has some great upgrades from the previous LeapPad. The two way camera is awesome. My daughter loves to take videos and pictures of herself."}

It acts like it is out of batteries but when we try to charge it, it won't turn on.  Then when we move the batteries around or plug in and take batteries out or do some sort of trick, we can get it to turn on.  Then eventually it just turns off and you can't get it to turn back on.

She knows how to do everything she needs for it to function. I like that it came with a charger, so we aren't wasting a ton of money on batteries. I also like that it came with extra styluses.\n The cons I have found were that it took a very long time to set up. I wanted to make sure it was charged and completely ready for Christmas morning. I believe it took 2 hours to set up! I had to update the Leap Frog connect on my computer twice before I was able to download games and then put in her information. I am also disappointed in the computer software, but that is another story for another day. Oh, and the games are expensive. Thankfully it comes with a few and I was fortunate enough to find some ebook cartridges for alot cheaper at a local store. It would've been very disappointing if they didn't include the $20 giftcard.\nOverall,we are very pleased with this product."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00CP4J7OY", "review": "We have two other Leappads (A Leap Pad 1 and a Monsters Univ. Bundle Leap Pad 2).  The Doc McStuffins LeapPad 2 Power Bundle is my favorite and in my opinion the best value.  This bundle includes a battery recharger and AC adapter, which is worth its weight in gold (actual value: $40).  It also includes a $20 download card for the LeapFrog store, two extra styli (one purple, one pink) as well as a USB cord.\n\nWe already have a variety of games and eBook cartridges (Cinderella, Bubble Guppies, Dora, Phineas and Ferb, iSpy, Jake and Neverland Pirates, etc). The downlard card can be used in LeapFrog AppCenter to purchase games, ebooks and videos.  Browsing content and uploading to the LeapPad is simple.  You can install the same content on multiple LeapPads in your family.  We've mostly purchased videos such as episodes of Dora and Bubble Guppies for restaurants and car rides.  The drawing app that comes with the LeapPad is also a favorite of my daughter.\n\nSetup is relatively simple using LeapFrog Connect software.  The features that the LeapPad 2 adds above the original Leappad is a front-facing camera, more memory (4 GB vs 2 GB) and better battery life.  The LeapPad 2 Power adds the battery recharger and AC adapter but is otherwise the same product.  (Though this bundle comes with 2 extra styli and usually you get 1 extra).\n\nLet me tell you, the included battery recharger is worth its weight in gold!  The Leap Pad 1 drains batteries and the battery case was difficult to open (had to use stylus or a penny).  The Leappad 2 adds a better batter compartment, but the LeapPad 2 power includes the battery recharger... it's easy to use and lasts about 8 hours of use.  It can be recharged using the AC adapter without having the remove the batteries from the compartment.  In an \"emergency\" you could still swap out the battery recharger for four AA batteries (regular or rechargeable), but with the longer battery life, this should not be needed in everyday use.\n\nThe Doc McStuffins design is very cute - my 4 year old daughter is a huge fan of the show.  The Amazon frustration free packaging made it easy to open and get started.  No clamshell or excess packaging, just a few cardboard separators and a few twist ties for the cords.  The batteries came with some charge and you can set up the LeapPad right out of the box.  You can create a profile for up to 3 children on the same device, plus a \"Guest\" user.  However, to use any of the content you must first hook to the LeapFrog Connect Application via a computer.  If you are giving this as a gift and you know your child will want to check it out right away, you could set it up and put it back into the box without much trouble.\n\nOverall, the LeapPad 2 Power is a great product for kids age 3-9.  Some of the apps are a little challenging for my 4 year old, but she will grow into the device with time.  I don't have to worry about durability or her breaking it.  It's nice and solid, her LeapPad (original) is still going strong (though no longer used often since we've upgraded due to better battery life on the LeapPad 2s). This is a great educational product from LeapFrog and there is a nice variety of content available for early learning."}

I asked the neighbor's father why his unit was so much better. After all, his was the LeapPad, an older model, and I'd bought the LeapPad2 - could there be that great a difference? Had the apps in #2 been stripped away? He laughed and  explained that the units arrive bare bones and the object of the whole game is to pressure the adults into buying the apps. Lots and lots of expensive apps. A modest \"app bundle\" is $80. He said he's \"dropped at least $200 worth of apps\" into his son's unit. Also, there are some things that are really painful for little girls: click on the 'Tangled' icon and you get NOT a princess app, but an ad to buy the Tangled app. grrr\n\nHaving said all that, if you are happy spending and spending (as the LeapFrog folks intend that you do) then this could be OK for you.

The styluses are a different shade of purple than the normal ones, plus there's a hot pink one too. The wallpapers are cute-but-not-cutesy. The $20 gift card will buy three or four non-movie-tie-in games, and LeapFrog has some great educational games (the cooking one is teaching our preschooler fractions).\n\nI have some trouble with LeapPads overall - they're very slow to start up or load games. Clearly one of the reasons this devices can stay under $100 is because they don't have top-of-the-line processors and such, but start-up can take so long that my kid actually wanders off and starts playing with something else instead. Some of the apps are also very pestering, like the drawing app that takes 5 seconds of inactivity as a cue that it should remind you, for the billionth time, how to select a drawing tool.\n\nBut as i mention above, amidst the money-grab movie-tie-in games that'll set you back a pile of cash for very simple gameplay, there are the LeapFrog games that teach math, science, logic, problem solving, and other useful skills. My preschooler is already starting to resist 'work time' at school, with number and letter worksheets, but will play the cooking game for half an hour straight and clearly have learned from it.\n\nA full charge of the LeapPad battery pack lasts longer than four AA batteries, too, which is great.

The device itself is pretty durable both in terms of build quality and operating stability.  It is a heavy and clunky device however,  and it does not compare well to any sort of android or ipod.  The screen is resistive and not capacitative.  I.e., it needs a LOT of finger pressure or needs the stylus. Also,  the bezel is enormous compared to the relatively small screen.  All this is really of secondary importance if you're kid is not used to using your $600 iPad.\n\nThe big issue is the cost of apps and the horrible interface with your computer (to uoload and download data ).  I'll address each of these.\n\nThe apps are a lot more expensive than anything you'll see on the App Store or Google Play.  The cheapest is $5 and a lot of them are $20 or $25!!!  And as a parent you're expected to add perhaps 10 or 20 of these.  Thats a lot of cake!\n\nAnd a lot of the apps or games are much less sophisticated than free apps on a phone or ipad.  The educational value is rather limited... probably greater educational value than game apps commonly available,  but for the money,  I do not feel like we're getting a good value here.  You even have to pay for an app that allows you to load mp3 tunes so your kid can listen to music.  And it's a very poor app at that which will not even allow songs to be selected individually.  Your kid has to start at song number one and proceed from there... you cannot sort by album or artist as you can on the most primitive mp3 player.\n\nLastly,  the software on your PC or Mac that you'll need to load from the company website is called Connect.  It sucks. It's clunky,  requires frequent \"updates \" from the company which you MUST accept.  The synching process can take ages,  it loses connection to the LeapPad and is generally primitive.  Carefully consider this because as the parent,  YOU will be doing this."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00CP4J7OY", "review": "We bought the original LeapPad when it first came out. It was a pain to use because it took a long time to stat up, had a rather poor screen, and, worst of it all, the Leapfrog Connect software was absolutely terrible.\n\nThis new version has improved every aspect, and the newer versions of Leapfrog Connect software (which I believe only runs on Windows, which is a bummer as my main computers are Macs, but do own a couple of PCs which unfortunately run the much hated Windows 8/8.1).  What has not improved is they still seem to use USB 1 as the connector, for it takes a long time to download software (apps, ebooks, videos or music) to the Leap Pad 2.  LeapFrog is apparently moving away from the cartridge model.  Even though this LeapPad still has a cartridge slot, it's hard to find LeapPad cartridges in stores or on Amazon.com.  Instead, apparently they expect you to download all software via LeapFrog Connect.\n\nHere's a money-saving tip:  you can buy the $20 LeapFrog download card for about 5 bucks off here on Amazon.com.  LeapFrog also has frequent discount codes, for example, currently you can use CELEBRATE to achieve tiered discount savings.\n\nHardware-wise, LeapPad2 is solidly built. It's easy to hold by kids -- at least that what mine told me. the 5-inch screen has a resolution of 480x272, lower than that on the Nintendo 3DS, but okay for education-oriented games.  It comes with 4GB of built-in storage memory. But it does not have an SD or micro SD slot for additional memory, so your kid should not transfer too much video or audio or photos to it. It has two separate low-resolution cameras, one on front and one on back.\n\nWhile the screen is okay in pixel density, especially for the target audience, its brightness and contrast cannot be adjusted, unlike the old LeapFrog Explorer or Leapster, for example. Worse, it still uses resistive touch technology, so it doesn't work well with fingers. Instead, you're expected to use the attached stylus. Here the stylus is literally attached via a lanyard to the side of the LeapPad2, and there's a little indented holder for the stylus, but it's a crude solution.  A stylus slot would have been a much better feature, so the stylus wouldn't fall out of place frequently.\n\nLeapFrog's learning apps are okay. They suffer from a serious lack of depth across the board -- and they ain't really cheap. A typical app costs 10 dollars each. Some audio books cost 10 or the more interactive ones cost 25! (C.f. half that much for interactive Nook ebooks or much, much better-made ebooks on the iPad.)  I actually paid for a few additional apps to the ones that came with the review unit. While my kids enjoyed a couple of them, they finished all the levels within a day or two.  Not the best 20 bucks I've spent.  I get much better values out of iPad kids' apps; even free iPad kids apps have longer play time.\n\nThe LeapFrog Connect software, which you need in order to download apps and other files (and to make the LeapPad2 really work, otherwise it keeps reminding you to connect to the PC), is much improved. Gone are mysterious disconnects and vanishing files or cryptic error codes that even LeapFrog's support couldn't help me with.  A couple of times it still failed to download purchased contents to the LeapPad2 on first try, but a disconnect and reconnect of the USB cable solved the problem immediately. Now, notice that you can't charge the LeapPad2 from the USB port; you *must* use the separate AC adapter which plugs into a rounded charge port on the LeapPad2.  This unnecessarily creates an unnecessary necessity for yet another unnecessary accessory. (I hope you liked my humor.)"}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00CP4J7OY", "review": "We thought we were being smart by purchasing this LeapPad verses the Ultra because of all the poor reviews from so many disappointed parents.  Our 6 year old showed a lot of interest when we first introduced this to him, of course he did, it was new.  However, the games for this are ridiculously over priced for what you actually get.  We would buy him a game and he either beat it or lost interest with it within a day or two.  The apps and games are also ridiculously priced, and most of the games are way...way to \"generic\".  They have a few Disney/Pixar themed games, but most of them are lame....sorry.  LeapPad's in general, in my opinion at least, are a major waste of money.  The video camera that is built in is horrid, all grainy and very low quality.  At best this is a possibly \"OK\" toy for a 3-4 year old, kids are WAY to advanced nowadays for such a limited tablet.  It's freaking incredibly annoying because it constantly repeats directions over and over again regardless of how many times you've played.  Like the art app, every 5 seconds it repeats the directions until you want to throw the thing out the window.  It's a money trap for Parent's, they keep sending all kinds of promotions to keep buying the apps and games...and very few of them are worth the money they ask for.  No...sorry, if I could I would tell anyone to stay far far away from LeapPad.  If you want a tablet that is decent, get your kid a Kindle Fire and just teach them to be responsible with it."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00CP4J7OY", "review": "I love the LeapPad2, we already own one and we love the affordable downloaded games that we can add to more than on device, and this Doc McStuffins design is pretty great too. I hadn't had one of the LeapPad power devices before and I have to say it makes my opinion of the LeapPad that much higher, I think all the devices should come with the Power set. Being able to plug the device in when the batteries get low is so much nicer than burning through four batteries at a time and trying to keep some charged at all times. I love that it came with the $20 download card, we ended up getting a My Little Pony game and all of the kids love it boys and girls alike. The extra stylus set is nice but we have had leappads before and never lost a stylus, and this one just made my kids want to change the color of the one on the device, which is no easy task, we ended up threading a bread tie through the string and pulling it through the spot for the stylus. That issue alone is not enough to decrease the stars on this product, my kids have loved leappads for years now and even the older children that visit love to play on them, they are a long lasting toy for sure."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00CP4J7OY", "review": "Lets forget about the other reviews comparing this to an iPad. It will never be one and I am not sure it is trying to even be one or any tablet for that matter. This is geared towards 2 to really 6 or 7 year olds and the graphics are sub par and game play is just okay but thats what it was meant to be. It is a learning device and as the kids play, they learn without even knowing it. My son could spend an hour on Subway Surfer and not learn a thing except how to jump trains. This lets you either download games or buy cartridges and contains other things like a camera, an art coloring page and a MP3 player. Its easy to use and my kids love it and so far they love the games too. I downloaded a few more from the Leapfrog website and hooked it up to the computer and it was quick and easy. A bit of problem first downloading software to my MAC, but worked it out with the support section of the website. I would so far recommend this device!"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00CP4J7OY", "review": "We have had many different Leapster solutions, from the explorer, GS, LeapPad, and now even a LeapPad Ultra. Overall, they're all great products, but this is the first \"Power\" version we've ever had (that wasn't an Ultra). In the past, we've typically used rechargeable batteries, but it's nice to be able to have a LeapPad 2 that is rechargeable. Overall, it makes it more simple, and the kids can even plug it in to continue to play if the batteries die.\n\nIn terms of this being a Doc McStuffins specific bundle, my 2 year old daughter is a big fan of Doc. We had previously given her a green LeapPad 2, but this one was so much better for her. She loves the included Doc backgrounds, and the designs on the device itself. As others have said, it is a bit sad they didn't include the actual Doc McStuffins game. That being said, we did already own it, so it wouldn't have been much of a benefit for us anyway. I do feel like other bundles I've seen had the game included, but I may be mistaken. The $20 download card is always a nice plus, and could certainly be used to purchase the game. Leapfrog always has discount codes, so it's pretty easy to get a game like Doc McStuffins for under $20 (regularly $25).\n\nOther than the above, it's a pretty normal LeapPad 2. It works great (lots better than the technical issues of the LeapPad Ultra). Very solid, well built product, and it's great for kids."}

Love the Gift card you can load up on apps/books/games ect, also the rechargeable battery a huge plus. The games on the Leap site can be pricey, but they are truly fun and educational well worth it.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00CP4J7OY", "review": "My five-year-old daughter has been wanting a Leap Pad for about six months now since she played her cousin's, so I was happy to get the opportunity to try this one.  Boy am I glad we didn't spend money on it.\n\nThe good points of this device begin and end with the ease of set up.  Out of the box, the Leap Pad will be ready to use in about ten minutes of hooking up to the internet and downloading from the Leap Frog website.\n\nWhen my daughter first got the Leap Pad, she dove right into it and played most of the rest of the day, pausing only when we insisted that she give her older sister a turn to satisfy her curiosity.  I was relieved that finally she won't be pestering me for my smartphone all the time.\n\nAfter playing with it again the next day for less than an hour, however, my daughter asked me for my phone again.  By the end of the week she had practically forgotten about the Leap Pad and was right back with the phone.  While giving in and letting her borrow my phone, I decided to see what this Leap Pad is all about.  Didn't take me more than 5 minutes to want my phone back.\n\nThe package includes nine apps when you initially connect to the Leap Frog website.  Among these are a decent art program, a pet corner and a game that \"teaches\" the flags and various random useless facts about countries the majority of adults have never heard of.  There is also a calculator, a clock and a couple other apps your average preschooler will never touch.  To the extent she has used it at all since the initial days, my daughter only uses the pet and art apps.\n\nThe package also includes a $20 download card in order to load more programs from the Leap Frog website.  At first I was pretty impressed.  The apps range from $5 and up and you get a discount the more apps you buy.  The apps include games, videos, ebooks and other sorts of \"educational\" material.  I was able to get five apps, so I was pretty happy.  At first the new apps didn't download to the device properly and my daughter couldn't find them, but my husband hooked the device back up to the internet and the problem resolved itself.\n\nThe problem is, the apps are junk.  The games are very simplistic and repetitive.  Among the games we got, there were two themes.  Three of the games involved inserting missing pieces to create a complete tube or waterslide to get from one end of a path to the other.  Two of the games involved patterns of moving objects out of the way to \"free\" something (a polar bear, for instance).  The one ebook we got was insulting, even for a preschooler's cognitive level and my daughter didn't want to touch it again.\n\nI'm sure our mistake was choosing the cheaper alternatives.  I'm guessing that the apps that cost $20 and up may hold your child's attention better.  But who wants to spend that kind of money on a child's toy that already costs nearly $100?  It's just a continual black hole sucking money straight out of your wallet.  You can also choose cartridges which can at least be shared among friends, but they are also expensive and are probably easily lost.\n\nOnce you set up the device and register your child(ren), Leap Frog will send you periodic updates regarding your child's \"progress\".  This is to give further credibility to Leap Pad as an \"educational learning tool\".  The fact is, however, there is little that is educational about this or any other electronic gadget.  Memorizing facts is not \"learning\".  Age appropriate learning for a preschooler involves hands-on exploration and discovery, pretend play, engagement with parents and other adults, as well as interaction with peers.  None of that is offered - and, in fact, is stilted - by isolated, controlled \"play\" on a gadget.\n\nIn any case, in this modern world, electronic gadgets may be nearly unavoidable.  If you really think your youngster needs a gadget, a simple small tablet would probably be a better option.  There are plenty of free games and other apps for tablets.  It may not look as inviting and \"child-friendly\" as this device with its two extra styluses and Doc McStuffins wallpaper, but it's a much better deal in the long run.\n\nUpdate 3/13/14:  Two other things I forgot to mention.  First, the Leap Pad is equipped with a camera, but it takes such bad pictures, your child will probably not want to use this feature more than once.  Second, on the pet app, your child can wash his/her pet which involves, among other things, blowing into part of the device to dry off the pet, which the kids think is fun, but I find a bit bizarre.  I don't know whether the germ factor bothers me more (especially since it's designed to be shared among up to three kids) or the fact that it's eerily like a breathalyzer."}

However, I think they need to realize that they can't charge $25 for an app these days, when my kids can buy an app for their Kindle Fire or iPad for 99 cents.  I understand that cartridges used to be $20, but the market has moved on.  I also hated that I had to hook up the LeapPad to my computer via a USB cable to update anything.  The advantages of the LeapPad is it's much more durable than a typical tablet (not sure compared to the Nabi, and the LeapFrog games have been tested and perfected for years.  My kids love playing the gamesbut more than the other apps? I can't say that.\n\nI loved (and my daughter loved) the Doc McStuffins design.  It's adorable.  The LeapPad is pretty easy to set up.  You have to put the rechargeable batteries in (put the square like tab in firstthen the cylinder)and charge it, before connecting it to your computer to download the 9 free apps.  The $20 card it came with is great, but once again, with the price of the apps, you can still end up shelling out $5 for a lot of apps, or might get one to download without additional money.\n\nOnce again, I'm a big fan of their products, but I don't see that this is any better than the Kindle Fire with FreeTime we have for the kids, or even a regular iPad.  The price point for the LeapPad is less, but with the $30 off deals for KindleFire, and the Prime deal on Free Time which gives you new monthly content for your kids, you'll end up saving long term.\n\nIf LeapFrog dropped the price on their apps, nothing should be more than $9.99, and most should be under $5.00, then I'd give it five stars.

I've used them at ER visits, sick days, traveling and everyday learning adventures. The key to my success, I regulate time and work side by side interacting with my child through difficult skill levels and the unit itself challenges them to strive high. Educating myself and playing the pad with them empowers them to learn and grow. My relationship educationally has grown to higher limits utilizing the program. The games have age levels indicated on the product and using the App Center. If you use your own Tablet you might run into a problem not knowing the best age requirement or skill set best for your child. Your child might get discouraged playing them at higher levels then what's intended. Hate to see them frustrated or even break your expensive phone/pad. The better educational programs seem to run better on home pc's then purchasing them in an app format. Company's are still working out app formats for their product. You might just receive partial availability. Where Leap Frog you get the BEST of all! Evaluating the graphic's, may not be the best at times but the Leap Pad 2 my toddlers are attaining the concepts. The durability I've experienced was at the hardware store and my child dropped it 6 ft up. No gel cover, it never broke and it rebooted itself. I was surprised it's REALLY kid proof. I danced for joy! Down loading through the Connect has been difficult, sometimes it cuts off through the down loads. Be prepared to wait. I've realized spending money on the big brand names had no effect when considering the smaller less costlier games. They love them all. Invest in extra reusable batteries, especially if you like music. Box indicate 9 hrs of play, you'll be lucky to get half that time. BEST of All if you have more then one child you only have to purchase the games once, down loading them all to multiple pads saving you cash. The app center runs specials all the time. Each child can play the same game, different units now. Your toddler may try to pull out the games while in play, damaging it if you buy from toy stores. Buy from the app center is your best bang for the buck! At Christmas stores reduce the cost, take advantage of those specials preparing for high skill games and ebooks.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00CP4J7OY", "review": "I purchased this tablet for my grandson for his birthday.  I was very impressed with the quality of the entire product from it's outside structure to the graphic, and various other functions.  This is a wonderful way to help children learn and become comfortable with new technology.  It makes those of us who only grew-up with a pencil very envious.  LOL!  Amazing that we were able to learn what we did without such a device, but oh so wonderful that it is available.  I support anything that teaches our younger generation.  Especially, those things that include, format in a fun way, and support the basics of knowledge.  This product does that plus a whole lot more.  Always room to grow and learn."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00CP4J7OY", "review": "My two-year-old son got this for Christmas and he loves it. LeapFrog suggests it for I think 3-5 year olds, but my son is pretty smart for his age. It took him  little longer to get used to it, but he loves it now. He calls it his \"phone\" because he can play games on it and take pictures with it (He loves taking \"selfies\".) and it \"talks\" to him. The device holds a charge for a surprisingly long amount of time, especially since my son never turns it off when he's done with it.\n\nWe got several games to go with it and he loves them all and has gotten much better at recognizing colors and shapes and is even making progress on letters and numbers. He loves to read the stories in the games too...well...listen to me read them. But he has a blast with it and it's certainly more educational than most of the TV shows he likes."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00CP4J7OY", "review": "We are huge fans of all things LeapFrog. Our children have grown up with a variety of LeapFrog handhelds and other devices that have served them well in teaching them reading and math, and even logic and reasoning skills. I love the effortlessness of the games and education. Education should be fun and should be rewarding: it sets children up with a lifelong love of reading and learning.\n\nThis is the second of our themed LeapPad2s and this is another winner. These colors are a welcome change to the longstanding green or pink variations - which really were a sad selection of colors - oh, and before that, the white didjes. Our first Bundled set was LeapFrog LeapPad2 Disney/Pixar Monsters University Varsity Edition Bundle and it is just gorgeous. It even has little horns on the top of the gel skin featuring Mike.\n\nI like these bundle packages especially. The value to them is better than buying the parts, separately of course. The included battery pack is also a great improvement to these devices. The battery pack is a game changer.\n\nOnce you set this LeapPad2 up with the basic info and connect it to your computer, the update should happen pretty quickly. Mine didn't take a full minute. It downloads the apps: Learning Songs, Art Studio, Clock, Calendar, NotePad and calendar and one app you choose from the 3 offered. Every time I have set a LeapPad up lately, I have been offered a discount based on how many apps I buy, up to 30% off from 3 or more. This deal is far better than the discounts that come in emails and I try to make sure I take advantage of them, even using my extra digital download cards to stock up.\n\nMultiple device app downloads: For a long time, you needed to purchase one app for each device, unless you ordered the game cartridges. LeapFrog has become a lot more reasonable lately. With these more recent LeapPad 2s and Ultras we are now able to purchase an app once and download it on up to three devices. This was a long time coming but they certainly made me appreciate it when it happened. There is something of a guessing game that goes on when I run up against a usage limit on one of the apps and then have to find which device it is on. This has happened to us with Stretchy Monkey, Reef Builder, Letter Factory, Elements on the Loose, Scooby Doo Spelling, and Disney Planes. These have been the favorite apps, by far. It is still better than only being able to download one app to one device.\n\nYou can buy download cards on Amazon at various prices. I keep them in my shopping cart and watch the prices. The lowest I had ever seen was at $14, except for one brief shining moment. But when you combine these cards with the discounts you will get through emails, they can bring the price of apps down significantly. I buy them on sale and then wait until I hook up a new device so that I get the first hookup discount. :D\n\nAnother thing that I love as a teacher, a parent, and a grandparent, is how responsive LeapFrog is to suggestions and requests by parents and teachers."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00CP4J7OY", "review": "My parents purchased this for Christmas for my daughter. They insisted on registering it on their computer which meant any time I wanted to load more games on the device I had to go over to  their house.  That was most likely the idea...whatever.  Three weeks after Christmas my daughter was getting out of the car and dropped it about 2.5 feet which cracked the screen.  I contacted Leap Frog and they said they don't replace cracked screens but this time they would make an exception...if I sent it to them on my own dime they would return me a new one.  A month later I received the new one...without any batteries!  I called them to ask where my batteries were and they said they would forward my complaint to the \"correct department\" and they would get back to me.  That was a week ago and I am beginning to think I will have to pay $40 for a new battery or accept I have an expensive doorstop.\n\nInstead of purchasing this 5\" screen with expensive content, purchase a 7\" screen tablet with a warranty for broken screens for the same price.  Instead of paying for overpriced content that can't be re-sold with the device you can have a better device with nearly unlimited free games, music and video with Amazon Prime.  Honestly, I don't know how this company stays in business.\n\n3/1/14\nAfter two frustrating calls and two weeks I received the batteries.  They are not the new batteries I sent, but I now have the battery holders that I can put new batteries in to run the device.  Now I just have to take an afternoon off to get to my parents house to download the apps that they purchased.  Hopefully the device will last longer than it did initially.  I'll let you know.\n\nUpdate.\nThe rechargeable batteries they returned won't hold a charge for more than 15 minutes.  There are so many options for devices that work and don't charge for kids games.  Don't purchase this product."}

I am not going to give it a bad review but am only going to compare it to Innotab 2 which I had returned in order to get this for my three year old.\n\nWhat makes this deal seem interesting is that they give you a 20 dollar card to spend on their market. Let me repeat, their market! Unlike the Innotab 2, which allows you to youtube, upload music and movies, and other things similar to what a typical tablet will do (bare minimum), the Leap Pad 2 allows only their products which are pretty expensive. I must add though, if you get two or more games, videos etc from their website, they will give you a discount. But these games are still 25 a pop. And none free to get either which is ridiculous. That means no outside parties are allowed to add anything to this monopolized market they call the Leap Pad store.\n\nHowever faster than the Innotab 2 with a way better camera, that doesn't compensate for the lack of stuff I can do on an Leappad2. Granted, my 3 year old gives a crap about stuff and more about Mickey Mouse!!! So my problem is a daddy issue and not a kid issue. I have to admit, I either want the Innotab 2 back just for more versatility (so slow though), or I want something in between these two devices.\n\nThe 20 dollar gift card did get me a couple items only because they give you a discount. Just remember, Innotab 2 lets you do whatever but horrible camera and speeds while Leappad 2 gives you NO VERSATILITY but decent camera and decent speeds. Good luck!"}

By the time anyone puts a few apps on it or buys a couple of cartridges, they will have spent the same amount as they could have on a kindle fire HD 7\". Put a few more on and you've covered the cost of the otterbox cover for the kindle fire HD 7\" as well. Want to put your own media on this device? That will cost you as you have to buy an app for that. Want to do anything other than the basics that are included? That will cost you money. The kindle has access to many free apps that will not cost you any money and are great for kids. I do like how durable the LeapPad2 is as it can take some abuse, but so can a kindle with the right protective case. My child got bored with this is less than a month since he was also exposed to a kindle at nearly the same time. To recap, if you plan on putting as few as 10 apps on the LeapPad2 you will have spent what the kindle fire HD 7\" costs. Also, my son was able to scratch the screen on the first day of use.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00CP4J7OY", "review": "This Leap Pad 2 has been great! Both my 5 and 7 year old love it. We are the kind of family that wants to delay our kids exposure to electronics (e.g. our kids don't have video games and they don't use our cell phones either). But of course, when your kids have cousins and friends who own iPods at age 8, then it is hard to make a case without making the other parents look bad. In our case, we believe that our kids amazing imagination is a result of more play time with real toys. So we got the leap pad 2 as an alternative to those other electronics that our kids don't have. And it has been amazing. They actually are loving the camera and video feature. They make mini movies of themselves and take silly pictures. They also enjoy the other games. We only got one cartridge (rescue hero bots) and it has been very educational and entertaining. Right for my kids ages. So far we have been very pleased with it.\nI also wanted to mention that when we got the tablet, the battery lasted for only an hour or so. I charged for many hours but it didn't really charged. I got frustrated and regretted the purchases thinking of the reviews that I heard about the charger malfunction. I decided then to reinstall the tablet (which deleted what My son had done till then, fortunately it was not much because he just got it) and then try to charge it again. Then it worked perfectly. No problems since then. Happy costumers!"}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00CP4J7OY", "review": "I would suggest skipping this device if your kid is five or above. The device is great. Here are a few things I do not like about it;\n-It  doesn't come with a button to reduce brightness on the screen like the previous leapster explorer device did. Therefore under dim light conditions it can be bothersome to your kids eyes\n-the battery life on this unit is poor compared to the leapster explorer that my kiddo has\n- the device is heavy for a younger kid, very slick and will break if you do not use a case\n\nLeap frog products have been in our house for a very long time. I truly believe that kids are able to play and learn at the same time using their educational toys. However, leap pad has been a disappointment considering the other units out there that can serve the same purpose with the ability to grow with your kid.\n\nThis device is great if you want your kid to have alone play time and don't want to worry about them drifting to other sites. If your kid is old enough to follow some rules and directions, kindle would be a better choice."}

We purchased this and Voila! Problem solved.\n\nIts durable and has withstood lots of tossing over the side od the car seat and onto the floor. However, it now has lota of scratches amd perhaps you may want to invest in a cover which are either sold separately or part of a bundle. Also watch out for those bundles. ... had I seen that they made a Sofia The First bundle when I purchased ours I would have dished on that and saved a bit plus had my daughter extra happy.\n\nIts easy to maneuver to the point where my 1 year old was able to use it and scroll using her finger. I did remove the stylus given her age though so make note of that.\n\nThis device eats batteries so the battery charger is great but we also purchased an Eneloop rechargeable battery pack which has come in handy for long road trips and for other battery eating toys.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind..... this toy uses cartridges or downloadable games but as far as I've researched you cannot hack it and place your own videos and programs. Therefore you have to biy everything via leapfrog's app program or purchase the cartridges. Here is where it gets tricky and costly. ... the cash adds up and leapfrog makes loads!! I was able to find some cheaper programs for about 2 to 3 dollars. Yet, the ones that are fun truly cost more. Some games are as high as 25 bucks!  I now wait for codes and sales AND purchase a gift card from amazon ( worth 20 dollars but price varies and I've purchased them anywhere from 13 to 16 dollars) which helps save some money in the end. So far I've counted about 100 dollars that I've spent on apps alone!  Keep this in mind and search the app store first before buying."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00CP4J7OY", "review": "We got this for my son because it had good reviews and it can't go online. We have an iPad, and have used that for movies and some games, but we didn't want him to be able to do internet searches or get onto bad sites on accident. And he was starting to be able to change settings we didn't want changed - sometimes on purpose and sometimes on accident.\n\nPros:\nUpon opening it, he immediately identified it as an iPad. We wanted something that looked similar to what we used so he'd use it more. He now loves his LeapPad and asks for it by name. This looks just like many phones with apps and tablets with apps, so it's great for him feeling like its similar.\n\nHe likes being able to explore all the apps, and I like that I don't have to worry about him messing with settings or deleting things or getting into something I don't want him in.\n\nI like that the parent menu is not easily accessible to him but is easily accessible to me.\n\nIt seems very user friendly. My son has not been frustrated when trying to use it.\n\nCons:\nI do not like that LeapPad automatically puts advertisements on it for my son to \"learn\" about and then ask for. You can disable this in the parent menu, and a quick google will help you if you should need it.\n\nYou have to purchase the mp3 player app ($5) if you want to put your own music on it. $5 is not expensive, but it's music I've already paid for on a device I've already paid for, so this was annoying.\n\nThe apps are expensive. Compared to most tablet apps today, $20-$25 is really expensive. We have not purchased any yet (other than the mp3 player), and may not till he's much older.\n\nAlso, the memory is not huge (4gigs I think) and there is no way to add memory. So it seems like it would be more space efficient to get the cartridges than to download the games and I think they are the same price."}

She's doing much better with her letter recongnition, and with following specific instruction when told to do so on one of the learning apps. She enjoys using the camera and art studio to create pictures. The plus side for me is that there is no clean up required. No markers, pencils and crayons laying around for our dog to eat up.\n\nWhen she's done playing, I have her plug the Leappad 2 back up to the charger so there's no worry of a dead battery when she's ready to play again. So far I have had no charging or battery issues what so ever.\n\nEarlier I mentioned that she can be rough with electronics. This is usually when she gets frustrated. The Leappad 2 has held up like a champ with her. Although I must say she hasn't really roughed it up. I believe because she loves it so much. Sometimes I just have to tell her not to press so hard on the screen.\n\nAll in all I would recommend this product to anyone with a child. My family has used Leap Frog products for years and they haven't failed us yet."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00CP4J7OY", "review": "I am a Principal of an Elementary School. I purchased this for my 2.5 yr old granddaughter. Through the years i have witnessed the educational growth of children. I have seen children start to school with varying degrees of maturity and education. These type of educational tools for early childhood are ultimately important. So far, I am thoroughly impressed with the LeapPad2. It is priced fairly. It will stand up to the young-child abuse. It came with the accessories required to use immediately. I actually ordered a few spare screen protectors through Amazon and am pleased with those as well.\nAs with any product, if the child is not interested, then it is useless. It is my Grandchild's favorite toy.(if you call it a toy) She thinks she is on a computer and actually asks for \"her computer\". Anytime her mom gets on the computer, she wants her computer.\nYou can go online and download more interesting apps.(free) As the child gets older you can update with more age appropriate games and apps. This device will follow them to school age children and then some.\nI had the earlier Leappad with a daughter that is now 14 yrs old. She still talks about the Leappad of her earlier years.\nI give it 5 stars. When you're old and your college grad child is taking care of you, you will be glad you made the purchase. LOL"}

Hands down this has been perfect. With games that you can buy online as well as a full update of his progress that helps recommend other games and activities, leapfrog is perfect. Caution though, no food around this product. Parts of crackers were found in the edges preventing the touch screen from working. After several tries of repairing online I discovered this problem and found the solution to use a small toothpick to remove food particles. Was really worried but good as new again. Has survived several accidental drops."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00CP4J7OY", "review": "I have to say that I was not planning to buy a LeapPad2. My 4 and 5 year old kids have access to a laptop and an iPad, so I did not think they would be interested in this. That said, I had very, very low expectations for this product, considering its price (paid $64 before Christmas) and considering the kids already used the best adult tablets and computers out there. However, my 5 year old was getting the newest Nintendo 3ds XL, and I wanted to get something electronic for my 4 year old daughter as well. Boy, was I surprised with the quality! I was very surprised by wonderful graphics, responsive touch screen and tilting capabilities, etc. I also found out that I could buy a $5 MP3 app from the leapfrog store, and download all of my mp3 music on the leappad - since my daughter enjoys music so much, getting all of her favorite songs on the leappad, and only paying for the app, made her Christmas. In addition, you can set up skills that you want your child to learn in several apps. In Tangled game, I uploaded her list of sight words that she can practice. In Roli Poli 2 game, I set it up for her to learn addition.\n\nI was also surprised that the digital apps/games you download - can be downloaded on up to 3 devices! My 5 year old loved my 4 year old daughter's leappad so much that I ordered him a boys' bundle the same day. He now plays with his Leappad more than with his 3ds XL. And the kids can have the purchased apps on both leappads.\n\nOverall, very satisfied with this product. Perfect for kids aged 2-6. I think the leappad is oriented towards younger kids, so I would not buy it for a child older than 6/7."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00CP4J7OY", "review": "For any parent out there wondering if this will entertain their child as much as an iPad or iPhone the answer is: kind of. My soon to be 3 year old daughter loves her LeapPad, but it doesn't stop her from sometimes wanting to play with our iPhones or iPads. I generally feel better about the content on the LeapPad, and don't feel the need to limit her time on the LeapPad as much as other devices. The one thing to consider is that the games and content can really start to add up, so this is not necessarily the cheapest solution, but the games are pretty engaging. I would suggest downloading games unless you get a great deal on a cartridge, as it can be cumbersome to bring all the cartridges and switch them out. Chose this over the Innotab mainly because of price and more content available."}

I'm always happy with Leapfrog, because they don't overdesign, keep things intuitive (so that even I can figure it out), and outlast its own technology.  I still have leapsters that work and get used, and this is far above that.\n\nI thought it was a little small at first, sizewise and the screen (used to 7-in displays now) but after I gave it to my daughter, I realized it's the perfect size for her tiny hands, and the screen is bright and not so small after all.  It's easy to scroll around to see everything, and I found my 3, 5, and 10 yo all trying it out.\n\nCame with a $20 game card that was very handy (have not had to buy any new games since given at Christmas) and the battery life of the charger is amazing.  I've charged it for the 3rd time since Christmas (basically lasts almost a week) and though the batteries I'm sure will start dying sooner, the fact that I don't have to replace the batteries is a real selling point.  I made sure to get the Leappad 2 since the bugs will be out (from leappad1) but not too expensive (compare to leappad ultra)."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00CP4J7OY", "review": "The LeapFrog LeapPad2 Power Learning Tablet, Green is a sturdy tablet for younger children.  Based on LeapFrogs reputation and the reviews of this tablet posted on Amazon, I purchased the LeapFrog LeapPad2 Power Learning Tablet for my four-year old grandson.  I also purchased the LeapPad get Ready for 1st Grade Game Bundle for Boys directly from LeapFrog since it was not available from Amazon.\n\nWeighing 15.8 oz., the LeapPad2 Power Learning Tablet is sturdy enough to withstand young, enthusiastic users handling.  The 2 9/16 X 3 7/8 screen is quite small and images depicted on it are less detailed than adults might like.  However, children do seem to find the cartoon figures and graphics appealing.  Instructions included with the tablet were lacking in detail and provide little assistance when it comes to setting up the LeapPad2.  Games in the bundles I purchased are not particularly engaging.  My grandson liked watching the Cars cartridge because it included Lightening McQueen and Mater; I was less than impressed with the educational value of the cartridge.\n\nAlthough my grandson loves his pad, I think a Kindle Fire HD would have been a more practical and useful choice.  It has a larger screen, the cost of the game/learning apps is less than the price of LeapFrog cartridges; and the support for Kindle is far superior to LeapFrogs.  If you are looking for a sturdy tablet for younger children, you may want to consider the LeapFrog LeapPad2 Power Learning Tablet.  If you are looking for a functional, useful tablet and will be using it with your little one, then I definitely recommend you purchase a Kindle Fire HD instead.  I wish I had done so."}

I had been going between the LeapPad2 and the Vtech but decided on this one after doing some research and I'm very happy I sprung the extra money and went for quality. The device is fast, the processor keeps my sons attention by keeping wait times to almost none. Apps and games load quickly and the touch screen reacts promptly. This device is very sleek and well designed. The buttons on the front face are minimal and small and I believe that keeps him from wanting to touch them. Home, power, and 2 for sound adjustment and that's it. The device is very well made with a plastic that seems very sturdy though I'd still recommend a gel case which fit very well. The apps have been great, especially the interactive storybooks. I highly recommend this product for toddler to K. I purchased one for the 8 year old daughter as well but realized after a few hours of play that she was going to be unchallenged and become board with it so we returned it and opted for the Nook HD instead, which was much better suited for her. The apps on this LeaPad2 only go up to a 3rd grade level and she is already 1/2 way through 2nd and reading higher than that so.. not such a good choice for the older kids but for the young ones there is none better than the LeapPad2"}

After spending most of Christmas morning downloading software onto my computer which I would later need in order to connect the LeapFrog to \"my computer\" to download the preinstalled software! Where as the other devices I purchased from my grandsons came preloaded with software, we just had to connected to WiFi and download/update them.  After everything was complete, registration, downloading the pre-installed apps, we decided to use the free $20.00 gift card to purchase additional apps. Well, even that was an experience. Yes, I know LeapFrog is a learning tool for the young minds but I could take her to the library for cheaper books/games than $25.00 and still have to pay an additional charge plus the gift $20.00 card! The real problem I had come about two hours later after the device was given to my 4yr old granddaughter. While climbing up on the chair, the device flipped and hit the hardwood floor and cracked across the screen. I contacted the company only to be told that accidental damage is not covered under the limited warranty agreement!  This just blew my top!! I asked the representative, how can a device which is kid friendly  and made for ages 3-9 not have a warranty for accidents and if not, why?  Bottom line, after a long discussion on my part, I was put on hold and later told they would do a onetime replacement of the device.  I mailed the device back last week and waiting on a replacement. Told it could take up to 3-4 weeks.  I just would have thought that these devices were a little more durable for these young little ones.  Really don't want it but now I cant return in because it is being replaced. My grand daughter has moved onto another tablet I purchased for the older grandson. It came preloaded with several educational materials and has wiFi to connect to other additional apps and some of them are \"Free\""}

It automatically comes with a few apps.  His favorite is the Petpad and Scout and Friends.  With Petpad he has learned to write all of his capital alphabet  and with working on the lower case.  With Scout and Friends he's learning social skills and different emotions.  I also love that i can plug it into my PC and see his progress.  Adding new apps on it can be pricy ($5-$25), but with the learning tools he's gaining before starting 4K is well worth the price.  It holds it's charge for hours and I really like that it doesn't have WIFI on it.  It's also quite durable.  He has dropped the leappad twice and it's still working great.  I would however recommend buying screen protectors and maybe a case just to ensure if it is dropped it's protected.  The leappad is also great for long car rides.\n\nI may be purchasing another one for my 3yr old niece as well."}

It suggests the age is for 3 and above but both my sons were able to immediately catch on and figure how to use the stylus pen or their fingers to operate it.  The rechargeable battery is just the simple and smart choice because all you have to do is plug it in to recharge it for a few hours and it last for many many hours, I couldn't imaging having to spend money on batteries constantly.

The quality of the video is amazing. Since it came with a $20 value card included, I used the card to buy one game and one ebook. But I did it just because the Leapfrog website had an special sale. I think my daughter had enough to keep her entertained with just the applications that came included in the toy. I keep in mind that this is just a toy. I bought it here on special for less than the current price listed, so I have not been extremely picky about it. She is playing and hopefully learning at the same time and I'm happy with that. It didn't take daddy too long to have it set up, and so far the games we purchased for her have been working just fine. I haven't try any of the cartridges so I can't tell about those yet. But I'll update my review once I try them. And by the way, if you want to know more about the toy, there is someone here who wrote a very detailing review comparing the Leappad 2 with the Ultra.

Love the special deal we got on it and was able to get three extra apps with the $20 credit, but the tablet comes with basic fun stuff just as a phone does, even a calculator and calendar, perfect for a growing child who will need to learn such things. This tablet will grow with your child, and its a lifesaver in places your child would normally be fidgety (plus there is a jack for headphones). I uploaded a My Little Pony video and some games, so she can watch movies or play games if we go out to eat and we're waiting for our food to come out. She is already playing a game meant for 5 year old's that I wanted to try (Barber's Design Studio). We played together, designing fabric swatches and making different purses, shoes, handbags etc and had a lot of fun (I must admit, I am going through a second childhood, love to play with all the stuff that is making a comeback from my childhood or some things that never left, but I never had the luxury of this technology so this is a real hit for me and it's good bonding time with my daughter). I bought accessories to keep this safe for years to come because it is an important and fun learning tool. Our favorite toy in the house aside from her pony collection."}

So, we purchased the bundle well aware that our daughter would likely not enjoy the LeapPad since she's had access to iPads routinely.  Interestingly, the opposite is true.  She's had the LeapPad and has been playing with it for about two weeks, and when given the choice between my iPad Mini and her LeapPad, she consistently chooses the LeapPad.  I think it's a combination of liking knowing it's \"hers\" and we used the $20 gift card that came with the LeapPad to buy several age-appropriate games, books, etc.  We are so glad we gave the LeapPad a shot."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00CP4J7OY", "review": "Hello- This is a writeup about my first impressions about the LeapPad2. They're in bullet for easy review.\n\n- More complicated than it needs to for a child- I was surprised at the number of decisions and that after almost every decision, the user needs to hit the check box. This creates a lot of unnecessary steps to get going. Example: Let's say I choose the Art application. I should be able to just get going and start drawing. Nope. I have to tap the app, hit a check box after the introduction, then select a 'tool', then am forced to select a color, then tap the check box, then I can draw. WOW. A child should just tap the art app, and start drawing. This is for a toddler, it doesn't need to be this complicated.\n\n- This still requires a Stylus. This caused great frustration and confusion for my 3yr old. She is accustomed to starting up the iPad and just getting going with her fingers. She hates the stylus and doesn't want to use it (I can relate). The 1990s called, they'd like they're stylus back.\n\n- No built in WiFi. You have to do everything teathered to your computer. Updates take forever and like bullet point 1, there are a lot of uncessary steps to get the device registed. Once registered, its all about buying more apps. Buy Buy Buy.. We get it.. you need to sell apps. Ok. I'll do it, but this is a pretty inconvenient way to do so.\n\n- There is no way to tell how charged your battery is. I can't find it anywhere. How do I know if its fully charged before I get on an airplane. On that note, there's no settings anywhere such as brightness, etc I don't expect a child to care, but a parent does. If they are using it in the dark, it would be nice to turn down the brightness so it doesn't burn my kids eyes.\n\n- On the plus side, there are a lot of videos and apps to choose from and its nice that LeapFrog doesn't have the bottomless pit of problems that In-App purchases creates. Bravo LeapFrog. Thank you!\n\n- Our 3yr old is having problems getting going on it (compared to so naturally on the iPad), but once she's going, she seems to really like it. Everything on here is about learning and exploring which is great.\n\nMy advice to LeapFrog Ditch the expensive COGS of another pad device, and just make terrific application for computers and devices (Pads, Phones, and Computers). LeapFrog is in very very sharky waters trying to compete in the pad market. Your apps are great, but the devices are jus ok."}

My daughter absolutely adores this thing!! There aren't a lot of games for toddlers, but she loves the drawing app and just holding it and pushing on the touch screen and taking pictures.\nGoogle 'Free Leappad Codes'!! There are 2 codes for free apps to download!\n\nUpdate: My daughter has had this LeapPad for over 7 months now and she likes it even more than when she first got it! I have purchased a few games/flash cards and she hasn't been disappointed by any of them. I highly recommend Leaps Letter Factory for a child learning the alphabet. I prefer one on one teaching, but this 'tablet' is great as a supplemental tool [and for practicing what they have learned] and also a great system to have for a child who likes tablets, because all the games/videos are educational."}

The camera pics are very grainy, but my toddler doesn't mind. She likes to use the paint shop to draw on them anyway.  I wish there were more inexpensive games for toddlers. Paying $10-$25.  for a game she may or may not play is expensive. There should be trial options with the option to buy after like two wks or something. Overall, nice toy.

This was my two and a half year olds big Christmas gift from Santa, she had been asking for a computer (at two?!?!). I wanted to find something that would be a useful learning tool and grow with her. The LeapPad system fit our needs. There are downloadable apps, videos, games and more as well as cartridges that can be purchased. The LeapConnect parent center allows me to set level of difficulty and track her progress (she answered x amount of questions and got x percentage right). She can already easily navigate the tablet and loves playing the games that teach her about shapes, letters and numbers. Having videos loaded was very useful on the long car trip we just took."}

The screen broke spiderweb fashion and can no longer display anything- useless. However, right on the front packaging, the product is proclaimed 'drop tested,' 'kid tough' and recommended for ages 3-9. Leapfrog customer service says they will do nothing whatever if the unit was not purchased directly from their website. Since we bought it from a physical store, we are out $100. If it had been purchased from them, they claim they will do a one-time replacement, but I'm not so sure. From what I've read and experienced, their customer service is very poor. Though my daughter liked it, I'm very hesitant to buy a another unit if they are so easily destroyed. So disappointed! One other note: the screen is easily scratched and marked. You will need to buy some kind of screen protector.\n\nUpdate: Though Leapfrog customer service is totally unhelpful, Leapfrog's facebook page contacted me within minutes after I left this review on their page. They said they would work with me, gave me instructions, and before the end of the day, there was a new Leappad in the mail. We received it about eight days later. Though they said the warranty doesn't cover accidents, they replaced the device as a one-time courtesy. From now on, the new pad is tethered to a table to ensure against any more drops."}

I promptly removed the stylus and now he just uses his fingertip.  The apps that are pre-loaded aren't the most entertaining, so adding your child's preferred apps is essential.  Get the app card and save some money on those expensive programs.  My kid hasn't used any of the apps other than the paint one and an e-book we purchased.  I'm OK with that b/c this is a toy that will \"grow\" with him.  The app library has a great selection of games, videos, and e-books.

One free app download is included, but you only have 3 very basic apps to choose from, and only one of the three is rated for children under the age of 5.  The apps run $10-$20 which is obscene considering you can buy excellent ipad  apps for $0.99 for pretty much any age child.  The display is very low quality and connecting it to a PC to download apps is laughable even for a $100 tablet.  Considering you could easily pony up $300 between the tablet and a half dozen apps, you could buy a Kindle Fire, Android, or even older iPad for a comparable price and have 100x the versatility.  The LeapPad 2 is headed straight back to Amazon.  Every alternative tablet is a better value for really any age child."}

I can hardly get them to put them down.  I was pretty impressed with the camera/video.  They were much better than the usual \"kid camera\" toys that have the awful pixelated pictures.  My older children ages 7, 7, 9 and 10 and they all received Christmas money and all chose leap pads to buy.  The younger 2 girls we use rechargeable batteries in & the older have these chargers.  The games you buy online can be downloaded on up to 3 LeapPads at once.  You can plug them in and remove a game from the device & plug in another child's & download it.  Kind of annoying, but you can buy the cartridge instead :) All in all, love these!  They don't feel junky or cheap either."}

For Christmas I got my 5 and 7 year old Kindle's but thought the Kindle would be too advanced for my 3 year old so I bought him the Leap Frog Leap Pad 2.  This device was a waste of money.  First of all I had to download a bunch of software from the Leap Frog website onto my computer (how lame is that?).  If I wanted kids stuff on my computer I wouldn't have purchased a Leap Frog Pad, I would've just let him use my computer. The screen and graphics are about as bad as a first generation Nintendo Game boy. The Kindle has a program for kids that has the ability to be much better for learning and has way more features than the Leap Frog. This technology on the Leap Frog pad is very far behind and really shouldn't be for how much they cost (this thing is expensive)."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00CP4J7OY", "review": "I have no qualms about the quality of this device.  My 4yo absolutely loves it.  She picked tight up on how to use the apps, take pictures, etc.  The apps and games are well chosen and focused on learning abilities.  However, the included content is severely limited (even though this is a 9-app bundle).  The \"included apps\" are things most people take for granted: a note-taking app, a music player (that does not support your own MP3s, and includes only one set of songs) and a \"camera app\" for a camera-equipped device.  Other \"extra\" features include the (very basic and altogether necessary) ability to charge the tablet by plugging it into an AC outlet.  The real problem, though, is when you want to buy more content.  Let's say you want the music to a favorite animated film.  Would you pay $10 for a measly 4 songs and a narrated story?  I did, and rightly felt robbed.  This device is, in fact, the most flagrant highway robbery since the invention of the $100 printer with $20 cartridges.  The Leappad2 itself is inexpensive and highly attractive, the included content well curated but extremely limited.  When you want to buy a game that would cost you $3 in an Android app store, with Leapfrog you fork up $10-20.  In the end, getting this $90 dollar tablet up to speed with a minimal amount of content set me back a total of $150.\n\nMy advice, bottom line: buy a Kindle with FreeTime and stay clear of this pint-sized money pit.  I certainly wish I had."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00CP4J7OY", "review": "I acquired the Doc McStuffins iteration of this product for my 3 year old daughter.  My daughter is autistic and developmentally delayed.  She has played some games on it, watched videos, listened to music and \"read\" a book.  Her older brother and sister got a Nook e-ink and a Kindle e-ink reader for Christmas and my littlest one loves that she can \"read\" like her bubby and sissy.\n\nI was concerned about the durability, as anyone who has an autistic child knows that if they lose their patience, things can go flying.  This has been dropped and sat on a couple of times today and is still holding steady.  I was concerned when I saw some of the complaints about the screen durability, but I think we will be okay.\n\nMy daughter loves that some of her favorite characters can come to life in her hands.  She loves that she can watch her videos on it and listen to music and dance.  She had fun playing with the camera and taking pictures of herself and everyone else and it fell asleep watching one of her favorites, Super Why! on it this evening.\n\nThe app/game prices are a little spendy, and I wish you had the option of adding your own videos to the device, but I understand that older models did not even allow for loading your own music, so maybe the video option is something that will come with time.  The loading your own videos and books is the only advantage I see the Innotab having right now.\n\nI wish the app that were age appropriate for my 3 year old were priced a little lower.  I also wish that there were more game options for the 3-5 range, as I feel that that age range is underserved an most of what is available for them is videos.  But despite that, my daughter got several hours of enjoyment out of this on the first day and I anticipate that this will be her new favorite toy.  She is obsessed with My Little Pony and received MANY ponies for Christmas, and they sit in the pile neglected as she has not wanted to put down her \"KindleNook\" as she calls it."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00CP4J7OY", "review": "Avoid LeapFrog products at all cost.  You think you save money or time, but they have the worst customer service in the world.  I am writing this review after spending nearly 2 hours with customer service, with them unable to explain why the $5 app I purchased was not syncing to my device.  However, they refused to refund me $5 even though I never got the app and they wasted hours of my time.  They say they have an absolute no refund policy  NO MATTER WHAT.  Tells you what kind of company you are dealing with.  Also, FYI, my son loves to draw, by they have virtually no art apps.  Like half a dozen, most of which involve tracing letters or shapes, and are totally redundant.  And they all cost like $20.  So whatever you think you save on the purchase of this cheap kids tablet, you will spend on apps since they start at $10 and go past $20.  You may as well spend $100-$200 more for an iPad or Android tablet where you can get literally dozens or hundreds of art apps, learning apps, ,etc, many for free, and others for a buck or two, and much higher quality,  This thing is both a time and money pit, and the company lacks decency or scruples and should be avoided like the plague."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00CP4J7OY", "review": "I bought this originally as a Christmas gift but I ended up letting my daughter have it rather early. Overall, I love this product. I think that it's great educational fun for the little ones. I would rather my daughter play with this than play mind numbing games on my phone like she had been. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind her to playing but most of us know how it is when out children are grabbing our \"adult devices\" that cost more than car payments..\nI got the Doc McStuffins bundle here for an amazing deal! I really do think the added rechargeable power pack is worth the extra. Kids toys run through batteries like crazy and it's nice to have something just to recharge. The prices of the apps and e-books from Leapfrog I feel could be cheaper. With the included 20 dollar app card I was able to buy two low priced apps and one e-book, and that was using a coupon for 30 percent off as well. However, many times you can find $20 app cards, and game cartridges here on Amazon for way less that average retail. Now, of course for this price you are not getting an iPad, so graphic quality is quite nice for this price range. No complaints from my daughter as she is used to playing with an iPod Touch. Even though this is marketed as kid-friendly the screen is still glass therefore it may break. I was a little hesitant to buy this item after seeing reviews pointing out the screen issues and the hundreds of Leap Pad 2's on ebay with broken screens. I am still keeping a close eye when she is playing. I think the particular Doc McStuffins one is really cute and good for a Doc fan. If you plan to get a gel skin the purple goes perfect with this model. This one comes with 8 wallpapers (I think), the regular apps that come with the regular Leap Pad 2, and a calculator, calendar, Note Pad and a clock and stopwatch as extras that do not come with the regular version. The batteries and those extra 4 apps are the only differences between the Leap Pad 2 and the Leap Pad 2 power. As of right now I couldn't be happier with this toy, my daughter would stay on all day if I let her. Heck, sometimes after she goes to bed, I play it awhile. Lol I will update this review if I have any problems or anything changes."}

When I did that and still didn't get a charge, I was told that the charger isn't meant to charge the batteries. I was confused, but the reason they said this was because they, for some reason, were assuming that I was talking about regular store-bought rechargeable batteries. When I cleared that up, I was told that the item was no longer covered under warranty, because it's been longer than three months- which it hasn't been. Obviously.

I purchased them last Christmas and only one remains. 3 days after my daughter had her first one, the screen broke. Of course we know that kids can be rough sometimes, but at the time she was playing, I was fully monitoring her (let's face it-- these things are not cheap)! She merely pressed her stylus on a button (no slamming or rough playing) and \"crack\" the screen went. I notified leapfrog and they immediately replaced it which was incredibly awesome and hassle free! The shipping time was just as incredible.. I was very pleased with their response and time management. However, 9 months after the replacement, my daughter was again playing while sitting on the bed with me and she bumped her arm on the end table with stylus in hand and \"crack\" the screen went again. I have not replaced it after that and refuse to. Don't get me wrong, the games, apps, learning, etc. of this product is nothing less than amazing and will keep your kids busy for hours! It's great on long road trips, etc. The particular package offered here IS an excellent deal with all that is included, but I do caution you, the screens on these tablets are not indestructible. In fact, they're surprisingly  fragile. I was quite annoyed that with a product that is this costly for a young child, the screens would be significantly more durable. I am not telling you to not purchase the product because it's absolutely fabulous, but I feel as a mother who purchased two of these, and had dealt with this personally, I should be forthcoming and give my opinion. My son (who is younger) still has his leap pad and is only able to use it under extensive supervision (as with most electronics/toys)."}

A whole new world has opened up for him and he is soaking up new information.  We planned to take the Pad on a trip to Mexico with him, and it may be the best investment we have ever made.  He played with it on the plane, in the car, and in the hotel rooms when it got dark outside but he was too wired to go to sleep.  He has already learned a lot from it and his motor skills have taken a big leap forward.  I love it!"}

However, after i received the item and installed it, it kinda disappointed me, the included 9 apps were not as good as i thought, in fact they were quite boring. The most disappointing part was the resolution of the camera, it was quite low, not as clear as the video ad that i saw online. Just Like other reviewers have mentioned, whatever app you wanna download they are quite expensive. if you want more educational apps or games for your child they're gonna cost you a fortune. Besides all those cons, my son really likes ipad a lot better than leappad 2 cuz he can get many music video online and save them to my ipad, and the games many are for free."}

I informed them it was now 3 weeks until Christmas, and by the time I completed all of the requirement Christmas would be over, including my daughter receiving new games for a Leappad 2 she couldn't use. They informed me they would attempt to get approval for another Leappad 2 without having to go through all the steps, and this would take about 24-48 hours. We have yet to hear from them now 4 days later. For a product that is totally, 100% child friendly, the customer service surely is not geared towards making the child happy!

The LeapPads are a great line of products for satisfying our boy's wishes for tablets this Christmas but it's a bit of a touch decision on what one to get. For me, the biggest difference between the LeapPads is that only the Ultra has WiFi built in which makes it most like a \"real\" tablet. It does push the cost up to where you could nearly buy a good adult tablet but then those are not designed with kids in mind.\n\nIn the end, I thing the LeapPad Ultra Kids' tablet is they way to go.\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/B00CS1WDBI/dp/B00CS1WDBI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">B00CS1WDBI</a>"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00CP4J7OY", "review": "This is an absolutely wonderful tablet.  Our 3, 5, & 7 year old children all love it--probably because it adapts to their levels.  Each child signs in by touching his/her name on the screen (our 3-year-old can turn it on, sign in, and play a game, watch a video, or listen to an e-book all by herself), and each child has a personalized background.  We still read \"real\" books regularly, but the Leappad 2 gives our youngest a way to \"read\" all by herself.  My wife and I can keep track of their playing time and their progress on our computer through the online (it helps to highlight problem areas).\n\nI really don't understand the reviews that criticize the cost of the apps., as It is a system rather than a stand-alone toy and each new app./e-book/video adds to its usefulness and longevity in the same way that a new game adds value to a Playstation or Xbox console.  The difference is that the Leapfrog apps. actually teach--in a way that is as fun (really) as a video game.  Honestly, does your child really enjoy those math flash cards?  And what is it worth to help your child learn to blend letter sounds into words in an enjoyable way?  It is helpful, however, to buy the $20 card from Amazon at a discount ($15 = an instant 25% savings) and then double up on the discount at the Leapfrog site."}

Bottom line this was purchased to give the kids a more rugged \"computer\" of their own.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00CP4J7OY", "review": "Awesome toy. MASSIVE improvement over the first Leappad.\n\nI purchased this for my 2 years 9 month old son. I bought one cartridge for it on Amazon also (Cars Ultra Book) and then a $20 Leapfrog download card to put digital games/books on the Leappad2 instead of buying more cartridges that will just get lost.\nI got both these two extra items for a massive discount on Amazon as opposed to in a store.(totally worth it on here). The Leappad2 came with some great apps already on it (like an Art Studio), and there are two download codes you can use to get a free ebook and a free game (I can't find them now, but someone has them listed in one of their reviews a few pages back).\n\nWHAT A GREAT TABLET! No, it's no iPad. No, it's not even an Android tablet or a Kindle. It runs a lot slower and clunkier than any of those types of tablets, and the graphics aren't nearly as nice. There is no wifi, but seriously, what 2-5 year old needs wifi? (not mine, anyway!). The graphics are perfectly fine for a young child. This is a great introductory tablet for a 2-5 year old. It easily introduces them into our electronic-digital world, in a nice, easy, kid friendly learning fun fashion. LOVE IT!\n\nI was even able to download cartoons (Bubble Guppies and The Wonder Pets) from the Leapfrog Connect store. Yes, the apps/books/games in there can be really pricey - but if you go buy the download cards from here on Amazon when they're on sale (like, a $20 download card for $14) it's a great deal. There's not any $1 or $2 apps like in the android or apple market, and I DO wish the Leapfrog stuff was cheaper, but I get why they're not, and I'm still willing to pay it if I can get the download cards several dollars off on here. There are $5 games, but most of the ebooks and games start at $7.50. The full cartridge games they have for download are $25 (I won't pay that - I'd rather just buy an actual cartridge here on Amazon for cheaper).\n\nThe rechargeable battery pack on here is GREAT!! NO MORE BUYING BATTERIES! We had the Leappad1 a couple years ago, and I was having to replace the batteries every few days. This is a steal. You don't have to take the batteries out to recharge them, you just plug it into the wall and the power button lights up yellow while it's charging, and will turn off when it's done.\n\nHe can easily navigate the tablet. He knows how to go between each game, and the \"back\" buttons and \"home\" buttons and \"turn page\" buttons are easy for him to figure out. It's rugged and sturdy. It's easy to wipe clean. It feels like a polished, perfected product.\n\nI don't recommend this toy for a child over 6 years of age - this is more of a younger age group. My older children have had experience with iPads and things like that, and they each have a Nintendo 3DS - and this is nothing in comparison. It may hold a 6, 7 or 8 year olds attention briefly - but I can't seem them staying interested for long and they'd get bored quickly, or move on to wanting a better toy (like a Nintendo 3DS or something), and this is a lot of money to spend for them to just outgrow it in a year or less. But for a 2, 3, 4, 5 year old - it's a gold mine. My little boy just loves knowing he has an electronic toy just like the big kids!\n\nUPDATE - My 2.9 month old has been playing with this constantly for the last couple weeks, he just loves it. I wound up purchasing some additional cartridge games (Jake & The Neverland Pirates and Bubble Guppies) for it (3 year old age group) and he LOVES them! They're great for his age, he can even pull the little green cartridge out and switch it himself. He's dropped food on it and slobbered on the screen and I just use a bit of windex and wipe it right off. He's also dropped it multiple times, but this thing is a tank, we've had no issues. The battery pack is still charging just fine, he can play it with it for roughly 3 days (maybe 4) before I need to give it another charge. We're still going strong and he is in love with it! He even started referring to my iPad as a \"weepad!\"\n\nUPDATE 2 (November 26th, 2014!) My son has had this for over a year now, and it is STILL WORKING PERFECTLY and he STILL PLAYS WITH IT DAILY! What he mostly uses it for is the cartoons that I put on it via the Leapfrog store. Yes, it can get a bit expensive, but I still think it's worth it. It's rugged, sturdy, portable, easy to clean, and while my other kids are playing with the iPad and my husband is using the TV, my 3 year old has his own little \"tablet\" to watch cartoons on. A year later and this is still money well spent. A+."}

I contacted Leapfrog and they suggested trying it with non rechargeable batteries. It still didn't work. I contacted Amazon and they shipped a new one immediately. So far the new one works fine.\n\nThe only thing I am disappointed in is how expensive the apps are. $25 is just ridiculous for an app for a child. There are cheaper ones, but all the \"good\" ones are $25.\n\nI see a lot of people who gave the product bad review complaining about it being low resolution  and hokey.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00CP4J7OY", "review": "She's getting bored with the installed apps.\nUPDATE: First of all, we now have 5 games and reading apps and the 4 year old just loves it. She participates in choosing the next game/app and makes commitments about behavior to \"earn\" the new game. The latest purchase was the Brave game (22 levels). It was a hard game for me to figure out but she got it right away, and the game has in-play prompts that taught her things the adults couldn't figure out. We've been able to buy a few for as little as $9 (just put them in the shopping cart and watch the prices daily. They fall, then go back up, you just have to time it right).\n\nSecondly, the unthinkable happened. She was getting help with the potty, and mom put it up on a shelf over the toilet. Unfortunately, it fell in (before any yucky in the potty). There was a My Little Pony cartridge in and it was turned on. We had bought a gel cover which was on.\n\nThe tablet cut out. We found a video online about how to take it apart (it was nerve wracking, and it was a unit a couple of years older, so slight differences) and we managed to get it apart without breaking anything. I put it in rice and we left it there a couple of days (this had worked for me on a cell phone once). It's been a month now and everything is working fine! Thank god because it was the adults who were falling apart worried that it was dead. My granddaughter had faith in us all along. Even the cartridge is fine.\n\nREALLY REALLY well built unit.\n\nI highly recommend this unit, as you will get your own tablet back from your toddlers. Just be prepared to buy lots and lots of games. She's reading on her own and her puzzle solving skills are amazing. And we don't have to worry about her downloading apps on her own or making in game purchases. Worth the investment.\n\nOriginal review:\nIt's not a bad tablet, the display is smaller than I expected (about the size of a cellphone case), although with the frame it's about the size of an iPad. And the granddaughter was excited to get it.\n\n But she's been playing with more complicated apps on \"her\" cellphone (castoff Android). The installed apps are good for a couple of weeks amusement, but either buy at least one eBook or game  along with the leappad, because the installed apps are pretty lean. She likes the puppy/pet app that comes with it, but after 2 and a half weeks she asked for her phone back. We have an eBook cartridge on the way, so I'll update when she gets it and plays with it for a while.\n\nI definitely recommend buying the cartridges (from Amazon, wow, the cost is so much lower) because we had multiple problems downloading the additional promised apps. So far, they're still not on the device. At $20-25 each the cartridges are too expensive to buy locally or on the Leapfrog website, so Amazon will get all of my cartridge orders. On average I'm seeing prices between $13-18 here.\n\nPay for the charger."}

I noticed the other day that he was standing on it and it wasn't damaged.  He has dropped it numerous times and nothing has happened to it.\nDon't expect a HD screen, the resolution isn't great, but is good enough for a small kid."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00CP4J7OY", "review": "I had a feeling when I bought this that the apps would be a bit pricey but was suppressed once I saw the online app center. It is not like the Android or IOS prices where app prices are usually at a dollar to a few dollars. In the leap pad app center some are at $5 a majority of the apps are around $10, and some of them with name brands like Disney are at $25. So you may save some money on the tablet but you can quickly rack up large app purchase costs. I also feel that the $25 apps are not up to the quality of some of the $1 child apps you can get on Android and IOS.  I have found that the game cartridges on amazon are cheaper than the digital downloads from the app center.  I also found that the $20 app center gift card is listed on amazon for $15, so you could save some money that way if you do not want to buy the cartridges. One more thing I didn't know when I bought this item is that it has a pressure sensitive touch screen which doesn't work as well as capacitive touch screens like the iPad. My daughter likes it so far, I just hope that she doesn't get bored with the games to quickly."}

The concept of having my kid play educational games, rather than watch dumb cartoons they put on TV these days, was great.  The only downfall is the price of additional games.  They range anywhere from $10 for $25 (of the ones I've purchased so far).  Though they are great and educational, they are still as simple as some android/iphone games offered for just $2/3 each.\nBottom line, my kid enjoys it, and though its costing me $10/20 a week for new games, I am still satisfied and feel that it's worth the money."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00CP4J7OY", "review": "First of all, this is a solid toy that does indeed have some value for kids.  However, with today's youth becoming more and more reliant on technology and skills such as telling time on analog clocks and writing in cursive already atrophying like the little toes on our feet from disuse due to increased use of computers, and little digital clocks on all the appliances in our houses, it's not a surprise that one company thought of the idea to make iPhoneish toys to attract the preschool crowd of consumers who have no money of their own to spend.\n\nParents, I've been teaching elementary school for 20 years, and have a solid reputation as an educator.  Please make sure you buy your kids a real book if you do end up buying this toy.  Make sure you read that book, or some book, to your children every night in addition to giving them electronics to occupy their minds. While this toy has some educational value, the true kids that succeed at school are those who come in knowing how to speak, count, read a little, write their names, and are familiar with social behaviors that allow getting along with other kids. Social behavior like sitting still to hear a story. This is a nice option for kids, but any child who is solely reliant on technology is going to be at an academic disadvantage from the start."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00CP4J7OY", "review": "The LeapPad2 is a nice step-up from the old LeapPad, but honestly if you can afford the cost difference, go for the Ultra instead. The Ultra has enough upgrades to make it worth the extra. Now if you're not sure how much your kids will like it, go for the Power version over the first LeapPad - the rechargeable battery will save your sanity.\nMy kids have always been pretty neutral with LeapFrog products, starting with MyPal, Tag, LeapReader, Explorer, etc. They enjoy them on and off, but they're never very attached to them. The LeapPad2 (in this case) is providing some entertainment, but again, they're not blown away by it. I should add that my youngest two (that use this) are 6 & 7.  This is also adding more play value to the games we already own for the explorer - yay!\nSo, to recap - it's good. If you have kids that aren't really into gadgets or technology - this is a good value. If your kids are always dying to get their grubby little hands on your tablet, then the Ultra is probably what you need ;)"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00CP4J7OY", "review": "The LeapFrog LeapPad2 Power Learning Tablet keeps up LeapFrog's excellent reputation for educational products while providing small children an entry point for learning how to use technological devices.  It offers a wide variety of available programs (some installed - others can be purchased and downloaded) that are both educational and fun.  It is almost like they have their own tablet and it helps avoid the possible dangers of small children handling much more expensive (and important for parents) devices.  It is a great product for allowing children to not only learn as they play, but also be comfortable with technology they will use their entire life."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00CP4J7OY", "review": "Our sons have enjoyed several different LeapFrog learning electronics throughout the years, and each of them has been great.  The LeapPad2 Power Learning Tablet continues this tradition of quality, entertainment and teaching.\n\nThe LeapPad2 is squarely focused on learning games and apps but the great news is that your kids won't notice it because there is plenty of fun, creativity and imagination built in throughout the entire pallette of software choices.  Our six-year-old particularly enjoys using the camera and video recorder options and then making funny edits via the included Photo Lab app.\n\nIt's also solidly-built.  Ours has taken a few tumbles out of the car or off the kitchen table and continues to perform like the day it arrived.\n\nThe LeapPad2 comes in three models:  basic, Power and Ultra.  The basic and the Power are identical tablets - the only difference is that the Power package includes an AC adapter and rechargeable battery packs - both critical add-ons.  The two primary differences between this model and the Ultra above it are size (which I think that this LeapPad2 Power is already perfectly-sized for a five- to seven-year-old) and the addition of WiFi and web surfing.  Again, I think that this is actually in the Power model's favor - I enjoy knowing that there's an electronic device that he can enjoy and learn from without any connectivity that I then have to police and worry about.  For my money, the Power package is the way to go."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00CP4J7OY", "review": "If you do not already own rechargeable batteries and a charger, then the LeapPad2 Power is a significant improvement over the original LeapPad2.  The price difference is only around $20 as of the time of this review, which you will quickly save in battery costs.  It claims to get 9 hours of playtime on a 4 hour charge, and that seems to be fairly accurate.  Charging the batteries simply involves plugging the AC adapter into the unit.  You don't have to remove a case, battery covers, etc.\n\nOther than the inclusion of the rechargeable battery pack and AC adapter, it is almost identical to the LeapPad2.  There are 4 additional \"apps\" included with this model, which include a calculator, calendar, note pad, and clock/stopwatch.  Also, the color of the device is a bit different.  In short, if you already own the original LeapPad2, I do not think that upgrading to the Power version is worth the cost.  But, if you are buying a new LeapPad for your child, then this rechargeable unit is worth the small added cost.\n\nMy 3 year old daughter enjoys this learning toy.  Unlike our iPad and Kindle Fire HD, this LeapFrog products contains only learning games.  (I believe there are videos that you can purchase, but we do not have any.)  She is not tempted into watching videos like she is with the other 2 devices that we own.  She has dropped this on our hardwood floors on several occasions.  Other than a scuff on one of the corners, it still looks and performs like new.  I did put a screen protector on it, since her original LeapPad screen got scratched quite badly.  I had some leftover Kindle Fire screen protectors, and simply trimmed one of those to fit.  It isn't an exact fit but it is close enough."}

We had a previous LeapPad in pink for our daughter, and my son really loved to play it...until he got his new green one (a \"boy\" color!).\n- We really love the addition of the rechargeable battery pack. One of our biggest complaints was how fast the regular batteries were burned through. We started using our own rechargeable cell batteries for our previous LeapPad, but this one is awesome with it's own battery pack...don't underestimate how convenient this feature really is.\n- Our kids love the apps...we downloaded an Alphabet Soup app and it's really helping to teach our son - and he loves to play it.\n- The kids both love the photo and video apps, and use them frequently. They're easy to operate and understand, even for a 3-year-old.\n- If you're comparing this to a Vtech InnoTab 2 (which we also have), here are the high points of the LeapPad: quicker set-up overall, faster response time, better stylus response, smoother design with sleeker feel, better interface for the kids.\nI would really recommend this for preschool to early elementary kids - our kids love it!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00CP4J7OY", "review": "I already have the LeapPad 2, but this is the Power version which comes with a rechargable battery. My one main complaint for the LeapPad 2 was batterly life. If they lasted 3 full days it was a shock. I am beyond excited for the charger now. There really isn't much actual physical difference between the two versions however, except for the coloring of the outer shell. The specs are all the same. This version does come with a few more free apps to download, which is nice since those things are not cheap at all. My daugher already loves her LeapPad and now she can use this one more often without worrying about battery life. There is quite a bit to do with this tablet; boredom should never be an issue! Fun games, educational games, learning tool, writing activites, etc... It's a great purchase and not terrible expensive considering all this is capable of. Also, I've found it is very durable, when my 15 month old gets a hold of it and tries to chew/drop it. However, I do recommend buying a case for it."}

The unit itself is easy for him to manipulate, both technically and physically, and the only complaint we have is more a concern about the sturdiness of it.  Let's just say it isn't exactly kid proof and while asking for it to be waterproof and scratch-proof is unrealistic the design of this makes it more suitable for sitting and playing indoors then the rough-and-tumble life of a six year old boy.

Well needless to say I got a response from my facebook email that they would not honor the warranty.

First - I check my spam filter everyday - so they were not sending me emails.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00CP4J7OY", "review": "I've been thoroughly impressed with our Leappad 2. My son had no trouble at all learning to use the tablet even a couple of months after his 3rd birthday, although most of the games are designed for children at least 4 and up. I thought he might not like a tablet for kids, since he's been allowed to borrow Kindles and iPads, but it's proved to be very entertaining. The games and ebooks we've tried are fun but with a pretty strong educational component. I'm a huge advocate of limiting \"screen time\" for kids, but the learning and interactive aspects of the games make me feel good about letting him use these games in appropriate doses. Although he's a pretty careful guy, he is three and so far the Leappad has withstood the normal wear and tear with flying colors.\n\nThe addition of the rechargeable battery is a definite improvement, as it saves the expense and hassle of replacing batteries. The charging process is easy - just plug in the tablet with no need to open it up - and does seem to get the claimed 9 hours of playtime on a 4 hour charge. There's a subtle color change on the face of the tablet but otherwise the LeapPad2 Power seems to be identical to the regular LeapPad2. If you're going to get one, I recommend the Power, but it's certainly not worth an upgrade.\n\nThe only drawback I see is the price of additional games, but they do seem to be pretty high quality, with enough content to be interesting for quite awhile. There are some apps that come with the Leappad, but if you've invested in the Pad you'll want to buy additional games to really get the full value out of it."}

Actually, after reading about a million reviews, I realized that the LeapPad2 with the rechargeable battery was the way to go. I am not technologically advanced, but I do know that I want my child to be. This toy is simply amazing.\n\nFirst, set up was a breeze. I connected the USB to my computer and I was able to create a profile within a few minutes. I want to thank ck_361 \"ck_361\", for the free app codes. In case you missed it....\n\nThe Book of Super Awesome Stuff (e-book): 5813 1140 1518 1413\nAlphabet Stew (game): 5813 0790 4610 4973\n\nSecond, the rechargeable battery is a life saver. I have to pry this thing away from my daughter. I could only imagine how many batteries I've saved.\n\nThird, we splurged on a few cartridge games since it was a birthday present. We also bought some accessories, like the carrying case. I would have to agree with most parents...games do not come cheap. I doubt I will buy anymore cartridge games for $25, although I have noticed that Amazon/Toys R Us now has some of them on sale for around $17.\n\nI pray this toy will last for awhile with no scratches or killer drops. It is definitely an investment. I love that she can grow with this toy and not be done with it after a few uses. So far so good! I think LeapFrog did a great job designing this toy. Depending on how much my 2 year old learns from her LeapPad2 will depend on whether or not we upgrade her to the LeapPad Ultra which also looks pretty cool too."}

This is half the price here then it is in New Zealand (even with shipping) so it's a great bargain for anyone. The recharger pack will save heaps on batteries.

This was bought as a Birthday gift for our 3 year old grandaughter based on the rave reviews it had received from other purchasers. We thought it would serve as a rather inexpensive and more durable alternative to some of the other multi [purpose and fully functional educational tablets that are currently in the marketplace. Boy were we wrong!\n\nAfter receiving it and setting it up, we found that the ostensible educational programs that were included with the device were hokey and basically worthless. Thinking that maybe there were better programs available we took the next step and went to Leap Frog's home page to see what what other educational apps they had available and selected/ordered another one we thought might be better. But when we got it and tried it we were again disappointed at what we found both in terms of content, quality and price.\n\nSo we gave up! We sent it all back and bought her a Kindle Fire  instead! (for only $50 more I might add)!\n\nFrom what we've seen already in just the short time she's had it, we believe that this may very well be the best decision we'll ever make as far as our grandaughter's continuing education is concerned.  She now has virtually unlimited access to all of the superb educational tools and apps that are currently out there that are not only AGE APPROPRIATE AND EDUCATIONAL but are FREE as well.\n\nWith that said, we cannot in good conscience recommend the LeapPad2 as an educational tool for any age group given the other viable tablet alternatives that are currently in the market."}
