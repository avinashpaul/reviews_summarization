{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "Just purchased the 2gb model. I primarily have a desktop that I use for everything, but needed a portable device to work on programming. I was going to dual boot ubuntu, but I didn't want to have to set up my environment again. Its still a possibility, but using nitrous.io there's really no need to at this point. I was a little sceptical about the 2gb model, but I've had no problem multitasking on it, even while using a secondary monitor. Speaking of, this has been the easiest OS I've come across setting up dual monitors. All you have to do is plug it in and it auto detects and expands the display.  $200 is a steal for this."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I have C720 with 4 gigs of Ram.  It is a nice upgrade from the c710.  The Intel Haswell process is faster than the chip in the C710, and the battery life is much much longer, which I find useful.  The 8.5 hour estimate for the battery seems reasonably accurate.  Really an amazing value at the price.  The offline capacity is improving, and I find myself using the Chromebook to create slides for presentations, and write, off line.  I'm not sure who will want the 4 gig model, which is somewhat more expensive.  For me, the added memory was worth it, but for many, the 2 gig model will be fine, and I would not hesitate to buy or recomend the 2 gig model for a child, parent, or co-worker.  While somewhat more clunky in appearance, the Acer Chromebooks have more zip than the Samsung ARM Chromebook, and are probably faster than the new HP ARM Chromebook.  The keyboard is not the best I have seen on any laptop, but I liked it, and find it quite useable, probably above average for machines close to this price."}

Because almost everything is stored on Google Drive, the computer's memory isn't bogged down, which means it runs super fast.  I am a college student in my senior year, and this computer has gotten me through.  I never have to worry about backing up my documents because they are all automatically stored in Drive.  Last year, however, right after the 2016 presidential election results were posted, I think my computer passed out haha!  It wouldn't turn on and I had to get it fixed.  It wasn't expensive, though.  If you go to a computer repair shop and they tell you that Chromebooks can't be repaired, don't listen to them--they're wrong.  Go somewhere else.  Someone will be able to fix it.

It's just not enough, especially if you like to have a lot of tabs open (4+) at once, and if you have a lot of chrome extensions.\n\nI've had this one for just about three years now, and it freezes up and crashes / restarts itself at least once a day.

It is still going strong, and I paid about 1/10th the cost of my wife's fancy macbook pro.  I've had the mouse get stuck about twice a year, and when that happens I just reboot and it is right as rain.  The browser crashes as well, maybe once a month or so, and again a reboot is usually required (refresh key+power button).  The reboot on this thing is seriously like 10 seconds.\n\nI'm someone who likes to have many tabs open at the same time and I had feared this wouldn't work due to lack of memory.  I do find it poops out when I go over about 20-24 tabs, but I found that knowing that, I can stay below that number of tabs so it hasn't been an issue at all.  I continue to do our family finances on the chromebook just as I did before on my windows laptop, via my microsoft one drive in conjunction with excel online.  For free.  I have a spreadsheet to track the sales and expenses of my small business, also in the cloud, and it all works without a hitch.  All for less than $200 over 2 years ago.  And if it dies tomorrow I buy another one, sign in, and it's all there immediately at my fingertips again thanks to cloud storage.\n\nI've gone from a skeptic to a huge believer.  I feel like most businesses should make the change because they are just setting their money on fire when they buy machines for way higher cost and spend lots of time and money on procedures to back up data so it isn't lost, when on a chromebook that is all just automatic.  I know this one isn't made anymore, but I love this machine so much I felt like I owed it a glowing review since it has served me so well and is still going strong without a hint of trouble."}

I used this laptop for about 8 months then put it aside once I had to quite school and worked full time. I would come home and sleep, wake up and go to work so it wasn't touched for about a year. I then began school again and when I opened the laptop it wouldn't turn on. I put it to charge but nothing happened. I was sad but I guess I still got my 200$ worth.

I was hesitant but after evaluating my computing needs, I realized that the only thing missing was word processing (ie. Microsoft Word) but Google docs has improved so much. I publish as a PDF to avoid formatting issues. Do your research on what a chromebook is and assess your needs. If all you do is check social media, email, stream movies/music, shop online, online banking, well then this would be perfect. Word out is that chrome will soon be integrating Google Play (mobile) Apps onto chromebooks and I'm not quite sure if this will apply to current (older) ones or if it's exclusively on new ones with touchscreen.\n\nThe good...\n*Performance is great. I have not noticed any lags or freezes. Chrome OS updates in the background nonintrusively.\n*The display is bright and w/ matte finish.\n*The speakers are also loud enough for sharing a movie.\n*11.6\"  nice b/c it is easily portable, thin but not cheap looking.\n*Skins and keyboard covers are now available\n\nThe bad...\n*The webcam SUCKS. Very grainy, especially in low light. Good enough for video calls.\n*I HATED the keyboard when I first got it. Very very shallow and feels cheap. I've since gotten used to it.\n*Touchpad is meh. It functions fine but can feel a little hollow\n*Connectivity is fine for most networks but I did have trouble connecting to my parents' wifi on an older router.\n*NOTE they no longer offer the InFlight passes! Just the Google Drive space and some music freebies which I've never used. Bummer.\n\nSupposedly the performance is superior to the Asus 11.6\" equivalent but I own that too and actually prefer it (asus) due to the better, more sleek build, keyboard, and touchpad. If you don't have heavy computing needs you may want to check out Asus.\n\nAt $200 this is amazing! It's been 2 years and it is still running great! This is my primary laptop I'm rarely forced to do anything on Windows."}

Now I would not recommend getting this specific laptop anymore, as I believe is has been discontinued as a newer model has come out. That being said, Acer has many amazing Chromebooks that are great products. I just recently purchased the brand new Chromebook 14 which I have been loving. I encourage those inquiring about this laptop to browse through some of the Acer Chromebooks as they provide exceptional value for price, durability, virus free OS and extremely fast boot up times and surfing the web is a breeze. These laptops are amazing for surfing the web and light tasks, and they come at a very competitive price point. I would highly recommend this specific product, in addition to the other Acer Chromebooks as I have had the chance to try out almost all of them and own 3 myself.\nOverall: 5/5"}

However, a couple months ago, it stopped working out of the blue. The blue light would come on when you pressed the power button, indicating that it was fully charged, but the screen didn't turn on.\nWhile I was frustrated, I think it was worth the money in the long run. I used this Chromebook A LOT. I suggest you buy this for your mom, who needs a simple but very usable computer, or a younger teenager so they can get off of your dang Macbook for good.\nI also really learned to love Google Drive, and I think it's worth a try. In fact, even though I have a window's computer coming to my house in a few days, I'm pretty sure I'll ditch Microsoft Office and stay with Drive.\nThis is a good computer and it did well for the year and a half I had it. It served it's purpose well- surfing the web and Google Drive. This is a good, cheaper Chromebook that's great for younger or older folks, or if you simply want a separate, low-end computer for work. However, if you can afford it, I would suggest looking at other, more high- quality computers that you know will last you longer."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I bought this in November 2014, opened it that December, used it regularly everyday for writing (Google docs), web surfing, email, Netflix, etc.  It is a fantastic little device!  Starts up quickly, keeps a charge for 10+ hrs!, and the battery charges in about 1-2hrs!  Awesome chromebook!  Every once in awhile it takes about a minute to find our wifi extender but it dependably does.  That is the only complaint I had prior to yesterday.  Yesterday it wouldn't find our house's wifi signal at all.  Without wifi this device is useless.  Literally.\nWe went to acer support and followed their instructions for reinstalling the OS and that did nothing.  We tried again.  Nothing.\n\nThen today we got a new modem from TWC and it booted right up, registered the wifi, and works like a charm again!  **Before you give up on this computer, make sure your signal coming into the device is stable and working**  I wrote a negative 2 star review this morning, thinking the chromebook was at fault.  Thankfully I was wrong!\n\nI have recommended this specific computer to many people, especially to those who need a lightweight, easily portable, putt-putt around the house, do random web stuff people.  \"Real\" laptops are expensive, heavy, and are not completely realistic for many individuals.  This chromebook is absolutely perfect for everything we need it for and was a perfect middle ground before having to commit to spending $400+. We took it on a plane ride once and since it had not been shut down prior to travel (you need to log on to the computer every time you log off/shutdown), we didn't need to log on to the computer and were able to use a usb stick to access google docs.\n\nThe only other negative aspect to this type of computer is that there is currently (May 2016) no ability to hook up and play dvd's on the screen.  We bought a small dvd player/burner and tried many different ways of getting it to play but chrome will not let you. But, really, that is a relatively small negative and, as long as you are aware, you can plan accordingly (burn movies, etc onto a usb and play off those-we haven't tried this yet but I've read that it has worked for others).\n\nI highly recommend this chromebook!"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "With an Intel Haswell CPU, this Chromebook is as capable as any for an unbeatable price.  Works fine and looks like it's brand new.  Some people have complained about Chromebooks not booting up properly out of the box, and were immediately sent back.  That's because they were left in developer mode displaying a weird boot up screen. Not broken, easily set right, but still, should not occur right out of the box. Also, some rare incidents of bizarre update/firmware problems you wouldn't wish on anyone.  In my opinion, not just mine, Intel Celeron CPU, especially Haswell group is the best insurance against weirdness, for best compatibility, speed and platform stability. CPU designation ends with letter U.  I 'm not implying other stuff is junk.  More like my machine works great as delivered. The majority of reviewers, have positive reports, regardless of make or model.  I have used mine enough to say it works fine, no glitches, faster than Windows 10 on oldish PC where I am too often mesmerized by the little spinning circle of dots.  Amazon allows buyers to send them back if not satisfied. All you can do is give it a try. Many say they are glad they did. I advise folks hang in there to learn how to use it. It took me a while to get used to, being constrained by years of old-style computer use; that everything normally works through the Browser.  The browser, Chrome, is also the O/S! Some apps, such as terminal app is a Tab in Chrome. e.g. if you open the terminal app, [ctrl], [alt], [\"t\"] it's not a stand-alone app running in it's own separate window altogether independent of Chrome, that if you close Chrome, app is still running.  When you X the tab like an open terminal app, you have exited the program.  In normal use you have a lot of open tabs, one for each app and/or URL. Files, on the task bar on the bottom of the screen runs in it's own window while Google Docs runs in a Tab in Chrome.  Most apps are commonly accessed through an online URL running as a Tab in Chrome. You should open a new tab to open a new Browser Window to prevent new Internet destination from overwriting the present window. This is not a bad thing, just different; it took a while for me to adjust to keep tabs open not just closing them arbitrarily out of habit.  Works a little differently than a PC, and we are creatures of habit for sure.  Not a big deal once you commit to taking the time and effort to find out what you need to know. Learning how to use a Chromebook is easier than learning to use a PC because it's simpler. As I said, the Shortcut Keys are really handy as the keyboard differs enough to require some adjustment. No sweat learning to use.  Better suited to Chrome than a mouse. A must, for us old dyed-in-the-wool Mouse-Clicker's. You must make the transition as Chrome is not mouseable. Input is via Keyboard and Trackpad.  This is not a big deal for Gen X and Y.  More of a stumbling block to \"Baby Boomers\" and older, but you CAN teach old dogs new tricks. There are perhaps a half-dozen things you have to re-learn to \"get over the hump.\"  Just a matter of finding the help and putting it into practice.\n  Here, I fear I run the risk of making it all seem too complicated. It really isn't.  I'm trying to inform a potential user of some of the differences, while at the same time encourage someone to give it a try. This review pretty much covers all the bases, or at least I've tried to cover the basics, not leave too much out. The embedded Help is very useful. worth the time to thoroughly check it out.  I didn't realize what a plus is the light weight and extra battery life.  Almost reason enough by itself to want to keep it.\n  This machine, out of the box - plug in the charger, turn it on, open the cover and you are greeted with the sign-on screen in 6 or 7 seconds. Charges fairly quickly and battery life is double most old spin-platter HD Laptops. My MacBook Pro, while still very usable, can't last forever and I can no longer afford the price of a new replacement.  A really big motivation for a Chromebook tryout is for security. It is a huge issue, perhaps more than many realize.  Also, I spend more time on the Internet than not. A tremendous resource for all kind of research! Like having your own private library at your fingertips. I have a spreadsheet of about 90 username password combinations I've accumulated over the years. I almost think the time will come when we'll be required to give a User Name and Password to use the restroom at Walmart!  I also use LastPass Password Manager but have a backup Printout of all my passwords.  My Bank username passwords are long. Gibberish, virtually unbreakable. Used to just copy and paste them in from a text file on a USB Drive.  Chrome can be set up to store your passwords making it easy to log on to Websites. The Logon Password for my ChromeBook is not easily typed in for a hunt and peck typist, so once logged in, I don't log out. I just close the cover and plug in the charger at random.  Running out of juice a non issue, so just open the cover, and presto! I'm in. I'm not recommending that anyone do this. Some Security Types may caution against it, but given it's intrinsic security feature along with strong passwords I am comfortable with it; so far so good.\n  Evaluating this device has little to do with performance or condition, which is fine. Some report that plastic seems less sturdy; cheap. for 132 bucks that kind of cheap is OK by me. Never even crossed my mind as I don't plan on stepping or sitting on it. Glass and aluminum is noticeably heavier. A  non-issue to me, but I don't want to dis... anyone's opinion.  It's more about making the transition from a full-blown Mac or PC to a purpose-built Computer with a narrower Net-Based focus. There is a learning curve and I recommend anyone read as many reviews and locate the Online Websites that act as a User Guide for newbies. Just Google \"Chromebook User Guides\" to find online help. Also, Chromebook has it's own embedded help file, not hard to find answers to most questions from more than one source. At first, there is a certain amount of trial and error involved. Helpful to spend time in the Web Store searching for Apps.  There are many apps either free or relatively affordable compared to PC or Mac Software. So far I have found free Apps that adequately substitute for some, but not all, PC programs.  Most programs I use, like Word can easily be replaced by simpler apps as I only utilize about 5% of Word's full capabilities anyway.  You can download Word Online and use it on a ChromeBook,  It has more functionality than Google Docs, but less than full-blown PC or Mac versions. I find Google Docs works fine for me. Default for Word Online is to save files in OneDrive, but can use Save As to download file to Google Drive.  Research online resources that will inform you about what apps are available to enhance functionality and productivity. There are Websites explaining how to either dual-boot or run Ubuntu alongside with only a few keystrokes to switch back and forth. I installed Ubuntu expecting it to be as functional as my PC version. Not so - bare bones - just the basic system. May have to use Linux command line to install any useful apps. I was not presented with a list of downloadable apps. Not for the average user.  I don't use it. Time was when I might have purchased \"Linux 101\" and played around with it. I like Mint 17 better.\n  What Chromebooks do, they do quickly and well. No Blue Screen, No pesky interruptions as your PC decides to reboot to load 174 new updates. My PC with Win 8.1 has over 300 updates, (I counted 'em), three hundred forty  %$(**&%!! updates!  Also, if you update Win 8 and download the freebie Windows 10, after all the updates are downloaded, (takes hours to do it), your Hard Drive will then be filled with close to 50 Gigabytes of Data. That includes 32 Gigs of Updated Win 10 + 20 Gigs of Windows Old Folder containing Win 7 or 8 O/S. Freebie Win 10 is downloaded on top of Win 7 and 8 so in case you don't like Win 10, you have 30 days to revert back to old O/S before Win 10 auto-deletes the files.  Win 10 lags a lot on my AMD quad-core CPU??  XP on my old PC was faster.  This Chromebook also runs faster. Cheapo Netbooks with 32 Gigs Storage Space not sufficient for Widows 10 and 64 gigs just barely adequate. You will have to ditch old Win 7 and 8 (C:\\ Windows Old) folder, to regain up to 20 Gigs storage space or wait 30 days for auto delete.  Also, most updates are are security patches!  No such shenanigans with Chrome OS. Updates are quick and painless, completely stable and reliable. Hours and hours of security updates not needed for Chrome O/S.  Chromebooks are a great idea and switching to, or adding a Chromebook could be a good move for some folks.  A good percentage of reviewers report they use their Chromebooks for certain activities and their work-oriented devices for tasks still requiring large and expensive software - the best of both worlds.  Many have reported that once they become weaned away from exclusive Mac or PC usage, they are pleasantly surprised how well-suited Chromebooks are for a range of duties.  You get 15 GB of permanently free cloud storage plus two years worth of 100 GB for free; $9.99 a month after that. Everything all in one place directly accessible from all your PC's, Laptop, Macs, and Mobile Devices.\n  At this juncture I have decided to keep it, (for $132, why not? I could always re-gift it to a family member), and take the time needed to learn how to make best use of it's features along with available apps. That will ultimately result with me switching over some tasks presently exclusive to Desktops or Laptops to my Chromebook and use the Desktops for projects requiring  more heavy-duty applications. This is a logical, proven path that many have already taken. If you are a heavy Mac or PC user, you probably don't wish to abandon them yet. My use is primarily online because of it's inherent security. (My credit card had been hacked 4 times on PC, but they didn't have the PIN, so only gas, meal and shopping charges). Also, the time has come for me to parse through all my External Hard Drive files and move the keepers to the cloud for backup. An invaluable tool for hacking through the Hard Drive Jungle weeding out duplicate files is the PC program - No Clone.\n  I find I am so used to my Mac or PC, how they operate, the initial frustration is using a machine that works differently enough that you have to re-learn some of the things you did automatically, without thinking, on your Computer. e.g. to Delete it's [alt],[backspace]. Caps Lock is [alt],[search key], but search key can be remapped to Caps Lock. To bring up right click menu it's [alt], [Left Click], or two finger tap.  [ctrl],[s] while browsing the web will save an an exact duplicate of that entire Web Page to an html file that is really cool!  Much more useful than just a screen capture though you can do that too. Really great for those of us of the \"nearsighted\" persuasion is the [ctrl],[+] (and minus) key combination to rapidly zoom in and out of a page making print much larger. I have made good use of this feature. There are over 70 handy keyboard shortcuts that do just about everything. These shortcut keys are very useful and can make a big difference in one's enjoyment and ease of use. I have found by committing to learn the basics, once getting over some initial hurdles it is pretty easy and convenient to use. To access Google Support, click on the three vertical dots in the upper right corner, (under the X), where you can click Settings. At the top center of the settings screen, next to the search box, is \"about Chrome OS\" If you click on it you will find embedded Help and Support links that are useful for getting started using Chrome and applying for help from Google. Search \"Keyboard Shortcuts\" in Search Window to bring up Keyboard Shortcuts where you can print a hard copy to keep nearby.\n  A most useful part of Windows is File Explorer. A necessity for wrestling your way through and locating a file from a half-terabyte of files and data on an external RAID backup device.  Chrome OS MyDrive is not designed to replace File Explorer.  Ideally I will delete 3/4ths of the RAID files that are obsolete or redundant putting the files I want to keep backed up to the Cloud.  I'm still learning how to make best use of Google Files. Curiously, I noticed MyDrive can be disabled in settings?  There are two USB ports and an SD Card Slot to utilize external storage if you so desire.\n  Enabling Cloud Print may take a little extra \"fiddling\" for some. Depends a lot on your printer and Modem/Internet setup. Preferred setup is to a newer Printer printing wirelessly through your modem/router via the Embedded Wireless Setup app enabled through the Printer Control Panel. Cloud Print can't find access to a printer connected directly to a ChromeBook through a USB cable. Can't hook up an external USB CD Rom Drive either. It won't connect to a printer hard-wired to a router via Ethernet or USB.  Non-wireless printers must be direct-connected to Mac or PC via USB cable while logged-on to the Network acting as a Print server.  A common example might be a printer USB cabled to a PC conected to your router through a USB Port. Newer printers use the Embedded Wireless Setup via the Control Panel to print via wireless network to Cloud Print. Will not work while that printer is also simultaneously connected to Internet by Ethernet and/or USB cable.  Wireless printer must be wireless only to access Cloud Print.  (Not really as complicated as it sounds). Worst case scenario, Google Docs saves document as an rtf, doc or pdf, download to flash drive, SD Card, or email attachment. to Print on Desktop printer.  Some report is a no-brainer, just set up in Chrome Settings for Cloud Print. I have two printers; a newer, wireless HP Inkjet and a 1997 HP Laserjet.  No problem with the wireless Inkjet; old Laserjet only accessible via Cloud Print if LaserJet is hard-wired, USB only, to my Desktop connected to the Internet.  Wouldn't work using my old Hardwired Manual IP address setup. When I followed Google directions carefully, It worked the way Google said it would.  It is possible that your old non-wireless printer might have problems with Cloud Print. Most any newer printer utilizing Embedded Wireless Server will work OK.  Only way to be sure about your printer is to try before you buy.  Google support can be contacted to help with setup.\n  While Google search will help you find related online information. Any written manual you find at Amazon or B&N must be the most current as chrome O/S is constantly evolving, so you may have to have to pay the max for the newest editions. I haven't found it necessary yet to resort to \"ChromeBook for Dummies.\"  Also, as with any O/S there is always \"the community\" for that particular O/S or device Manufacturer.\n  What I have discovered so far is that Chromebooks are fairly capable; more practical and useful than is generally known about them. It's worth the effort to find out if it will be suitable for your needs.  So far for me, at this point, I figure what Chrome doesn't do, I can do on my PC, but as I become more familiar with this device, I seem to be spending more time on it and less on my Laptop, perhaps 60/40 and/or vice versa.  As mentioned, I spend most all my Internet time via Chromebook. Reflects the big issue of our day, namely, how much freedom and convenience are we willing to sacrifice for the sake of security?\n  I 've been taking inventory of  my pile of stuff accumulated over the years. Can't give it away; I find I'm hesitant to just throw it away too. (No guts no glory)! For me, the whole computer thing keeps growing arms and legs. Owned five computers until recently. Too darn complicated! Too much stuff! I am a data hoarder.  Not in our house, my Hardrives! Lots of external storage.  I still have a null-modem serial cable left over from 1990. Need to let go of the 20th century. There is no better example of cyber-hoarding than with long-term Computer and Electronic Gadget usage. (mostly a guy thing).  I am desperately trying to simplify, simplify.  1. What is it you really need?  2. What are you willing to throw away and do without?  3. Are we willing to make better use of less instead of just accumulating more ad infinatum?  Sounds easy, but I find it somewhat daunting.\n  At present, my Desktop is still indispensable for a small group of computing tasks that can't be substituted on a lighter duty device. On the other hand, using the Chromebook, it just kinda grows on you. Also a Chromebook, in tandem with their Smartphones, (what kid doesn't already have a Smartphone?),  would most likely do all that my four student granddaughters would need on a daily basis. A good H.S. Graduation present? Waaaaay less expensive than a Macbook Air or Surface 4.\n  Fast enough, lightweight, very portable. Long battery life, a big plus adding to it's usability. Maybe a good fit for older, non-mobile, Internet and email only crowd.  Some say they won't leave home without it.  For under $200 purchase price, it's worth a shot!\n\nWalter O."}

I use it all the time, I can't get enough of the speed it loads everything, its long battery life (still gets 6-7 hrs per charge), and how light it is. I had a tablet computer for engineering school running Windows 7 and it was as slow as mud. I got this chromebook when it died halfway through senior year and I loved it from the moment I turned it on and it was booted up within 5 seconds and ready for me to play with within 2 minutes.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "This product is ideal for students that want the versatility and portability of a tablet with the practicality of a laptop.  The Acer C720 Chromebook has a slightly larger screen than the iPad Air while not being significantly much heavier or bulky, still fitting easily into any backpack.  Most students are going to need a product that has a battery that can last through the day; this device has this ability and more.  I have gone several days with this product before needing a charge.  This product can meet any needs of a college student working on campus.\n\nThe battery life of the device is one of the key reasons that I chose the Chromebook over a tablet.  Normally you would see a device lose battery capacity over time, but I have not seen that in my ownership of the Chromebook.  In the year and a half of owning the Chromebook, on a near daily basis, it still provides me with around 10 hours of use on one full charge. With the long battery life you don't have to worry about bringing the charger with you to class.\n\nIts tablet like simplicity is ideal for students that are looking for a note-taking and web browsing type of device.  While it doesn't provide much in terms of computing power for more heavy loaded software, that's not what the product is designed for.  The product is almost entirely internet based for device storage. While it may be an issue for some, college students are going to have internet access while on campus anyways. Its differences from a tablet however make it more ideal for me as a sports fan.  The Chromebook has a full HDMI port allowing you to display onto a TV or Projector, which you won't find on a tablet.\n\nA college student is going to need a product that provides access to internet based classwork.  The Chromebook is the ideal product with a great combination of portability, price, and battery life.  All the things considered I have been very pleased in my experience of owning the Acer C720 and would I would certainly recommend it to current and incoming college students."}

ChromeOS aside, this is one of my favorite laptops I've ever owned and at this price point it's a big deal.\n\nPros:  Very sturdy with great build quality.  The keyboard is great, the audio is decent, and the trackpad is on par with my Macbook, though smaller.  The screen is a little meh, but it's fine and compared to other low end laptops it's completely expected to not be high quality.  Another thing that sets this laptop above the others is the CPU.  It has a 2955u!  Compared to my Samsung 11.6\" the C720 does not have the same hanging tab issues and it handles multitasking MUCH better.  Sure the C720 has a fan, but it's hardly noticeable and is typically very low, or off.  The C720 is a little thicker RELATIVE to other super thin, ultrabook like Chromebooks but when you compare the C720 to other non-ChromeOS laptops it's still a very thin laptop and very light.\n\nCons:  None.  At this price there is nothing to complain about.  If possible I would have bought a 4GB model instead but at that point people were asking too much for them since they were pretty hard to find.  I've had this laptop since they came out."}

I bought this as a replacement for the first replacement: a Toshiba chromebook CB35-B334 I had to return as junk.\n\nIt's small, sturdy, good battery life, a completely smooth transition.  Faster than its earlier incarnation, and beautiful bright screen."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "This little machine has been my constant companion for over a year now. Not once has it restarted by itself, frozen, or crashed. Something that is lacking as technology has advanced is reliability. Fancier processors, more ram, but somehow PCs still manage to mess up. Not this little chromebook! I can honestly say that this is the most pleasant computing experience I've ever had, and I've used everything from an Alienware laptop to a macbook pro.\n\nFirst, it's small. Not too small, but portable and sturdy enough to carry around with minimal effort. It slides into my backpack easily, and doesn't flex under pressure. I had an HP 14 chromebook before this, and it felt much flimsier than the Acer. The screen is matte, which means there won't be any glare. Ever. Sure, it doesn't have the \"pop\" that a glossy screen has, but it's never bothered me. It can get very bright, and is crisp and clear to read. If you so choose, you can hook it up to a TV or external monitor and it will output 1080p instantly and with no lag. I regularly hook it up to my TV for netflix binges. Speaking of which, if you have a wireless mouse and keyboard, you can hook it up to the TV and close it to save battery. It will enter 'docked mode', where the screen is off, but it still outputs to the external monitor. Pretty damn nifty.\n\nSpeaking of battery, this thing reminds me of the old energizer bunny commercials. I've gotten 10 hours on one charge with the screen dimmed before. Average is probably about 8 and a half, although personally I never use it for that long consecutively. I usually charge it once every 2 or 3 days, and it goes from 0-100 in about an hour. That's impressive. This is by far one of the most killer features of chromebooks, they just last much longer than their Windows counterparts. I'd say you could easily make it through an entire work or school day without needing a charge.\n\nThe keyboard really shines; it's the best I've ever used on a laptop. It's nearly full sized, the keys depress just enough, and there's a satisfying *click* with every press. Writing this review has been a seamless and enjoyable experience, thanks to the superb keyboard and trackpad. Another surprise was how loud and clear the speakers are. They can fill an entire room and not distort. I find myself playing music on the chromeboo more often than I expected because of this.\n\nOther less enjoyable features are the average webcam, the fan that is quiet but persistently on, and the fingerprint magnet around the screen. The screen itself is matte, but the surrounding bezel is a glossy black, which gets dirty and stays dirty. The computer can get a little warm under load, but it's never gotten \"hot\", the fan seems to take care of that. I hear it buzzing more often than I'd like (I'm just on facebook, chill out, fan), but it;s never annoyed me. I also would have liked to see full size arrow keys (the left and right are full, but the up and down are one key size split into 2). Other than these few qualms, this is a great laptop and even greater value.\n\nCombined with the stellar battery, low price, zippy performance, and ultra portability, this is the little chromebook that could. Over a year old and it's still as fast as the day I opened it. I use it every day, and I will continue to use it until I see it fit for a replacement. And I don't see that happening for a long time."}

My biggest concern before buying it was whether I can write in latex with it, but I quickly found some web-based latex editor. BUT it retired today because after two years of good service, it won't charge any more. Annoyingly, Acer has since changed the type of chargers they use for both chromebooks and laptops so the local best buy's geek squad does not even have a charger that they can use to diagnose what is wrong with it. Other two cons: (1) printing is troublesome. I cannot connect it wirelessly to my university printer because the university printer is not a cloud printer. (2) a little fragile. one time it fell to the carpet floor from the chair, then it was dead. Thankfully IT people at work opened it up and found that the hard drive is dis-located and repositioned it."}

I've been wary of ordering laptops online, you never know if it's going to come all messed up or different from what you expected, but this came out great. It's a chromebook; so don't expect it to run like Windows or like Macbooks. It's very fast and easy to pick up. It's great to use if you want to browse the web, but it's a little more difficult than other laptops to use for printing and office work. But that's the operating system's fault, not the hardware. Everything came clean and crisp and it actually looks good for a laptop. It's not a full size heavy-duty laptop, more of a notebook. I'm happy with my purchase, just that it takes a little more time to get used to using the Google operating system."}

But if you work with different file types, or you use dropbox to save your files - look elsewhere.  True, you can use their dropbox app or go to the website.  But if you want to setup an automatic save to dropbox - which I can do with my Windows pc - it's a very tediuos process.  Another problem - I could not open a csv file on either their google drive or the Excel app.  The excel app from google store is an extension of the microsoft 365 software.  I happen to have an account but never used it exclusively online before.  Not fun.  It couldn't open a simple csv file - all I got was gibberish.  Problem 3 - as soon as I started up chrome, I got this annyoying message telling me to update my browser.  Huhhh???  I just got this computer today.  I would have thought that a chromebook - being online and all - would already have the latest chrome; or at least it should have updated itself as soon as connected.  Not the case.  I spent considerable time trying to find a solution but the message kept popping up.  And by the way, their help center sucks!  Had no info at all on the subject, and of course no email or phone #.

It is an extremely budget friendly laptop but it doesn't preform like that at all. The construction is hard plastic, that feels very well built and the keyboard is very easy to type on, even for long periods of time. Yes, it is a chrome book, so you can only use google's programs, but for me, and most people that were used to using windows, it is a surprisingly easy adjustment. It wasn't until I used it that I realized I barely used any programs exclusively for windows. Even the few programs that I did use on windows had equally good alternatives (like google docs to Microsoft word). Another plus is that the battery life is incredibly long. I have taken short trips with the laptop and not even hesitated to leave the charger at home. And even when the battery is nearly dead, the laptop charges within a very reasonable time. (One hour usually). Overall, if you are in the market for a new laptop that you will not need 24/7, I would highly recommend the c720."}

The chromebook weighs only 2.8 lbs, has a screen size of 11.6, and is only priced at $216.\n\nDetails:\nThe Acer C720 competes with the best of them. The criteria that I was looking for in a laptop, being a college student, included, in order: overall performance speed, price, size, video playback/quality, battery life, design quality, and memory capacity. You won't find a better laptop for a cheaper price.\n\nPerformance:\nThe chromebook runs all of my common apps flawlessly like google drive, google docs, gmail, and streams video seamlessly on netflix and youtube. The chromebook has a great battery life at around eight hours and two years of free 100GB on google drive.\n\nExternal:\nWhen I bought the Chromebook it was only $199, a little pricier now at $216, but still a great deal.\nIts compact size, at 11.6 and 2.8 lbs, is nice for the small college desks that im accustomed to and its low weight makes it easy to carry around campus. Its design quality is nothing too fancy, its got a sleek black and grey look with acer on the front and back as well as a good quality touch pad and solid keyboard.\n\nDownside:\nMost people are used to a Windows system, this runs a chrome OS system, but it will still perform most of the functions that are used in Windows.\n\nUpside:\nHigh speed performance:\n  Quick boot up, 5-10 seconds until you're logged on\n  Seamless Video Streaming\n  Intel Celeron 2955U Haswell Processor\nLightweight, only 2.8 lbs\nGreat Price, $216\n8-hour battery life\nGoogle Apps allows you to use Windows-like programs\nAnti-glare screen\n16 GB Drive\nIntel HD Graphics\nHD webcam\n\nOverall the Acer C720 Chromebook is a great portable computer at a great price."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I bought a 2GB Acer C720-2802 in June 2014 to use for study during my senior year of high school  I was getting tired of my incredibly slow and outdated eight-year-old iMac, and I wanted a portable device I could take between classes. I've had it for more than 13 months now, and my experience has been overwhelmingly positive (I've had one broken screen, but more on that later). It quickly eclipsed the iMac in almost every respect (I now only turn on the other computer for about ten minutes every two weeks, to scan documents or work with CDs) and impressed me with its sheer simplicity and versatility. Like other reviewers, I started wondering why anyone really needed anything more powerful.\n\nThe most important thing to keep in mind when buying a Chromebook is that you aren't really buying a conventional computer. Its Chrome OS operating system is mostly designed to be used online, has limited offline capabilities, and will only support apps from the Chrome Web Store. Consequently, you don't have quite as much freedom with it as you would most other laptops. On the other hand, you'd be surprised at the amount of things that you can do with just Google Chrome, Google Drive with offline capabilities, and the Web Store apps. It can open and edit Microsoft Office documents (although using an app that doesn't offer Office's full functionality), print via Google Cloud Print (which pretty much all modern printers have), stream music via Spotify and Google Play (or play music from an offline library), and edit emails offline via a Gmail app. I managed a year's worth of schoolwork, Web surfing, Netflix, and music streaming without any trouble at all, although I did come to miss things like games and Skype.\n\nIn the same vein, the Chromebook isn't especially powerful with 2GB of RAM and a 1.4GHz Intel processor, and its 16GB of storage isn't exactly huge, but Google's great OS means you don't really notice either. You don't need a lot of RAM or processing power for web browsing  I experience a little slowdown when I have 10-15 tabs open, or when I'm loading a web page full of .gif files, but it's really not that noticeable. In fact, Web browsing is usually very fast. Similarly, since the OS encourages storing almost everything in the cloud anyway and I can choose whether or not to sync an offline copy, I've never run into storage issues (I still have more than 2/3rds left). Plus, you get 100GB of Google Drive space for two years, which is a fantastic deal and more than you could possibly know what to do with (the other \"goodies\", like the GoGo Inflight passes and the 2-month Google Play free trial, are really good value as well). If you really do need more storage, it's easy enough to plug in a flash drive or external hard drive.\n\nI think that the best quality of the C720, however, is how incredibly user-friendly it is. It requires zero setup beyond creating a user account. Thanks to its solid-state drive and pared-down operating system, it really does boot up in less than the advertised 7 seconds (and hasn't slowed down at all!) It comes preinstalled with security features that Google says make antivirus programs unnecessary, and it updates quietly and automatically when you restart it. Its battery life is incredible: it gets the advertised 8.5 hours easily with normal use; during the school year, when I would keep the screen at 50% brightness and do little more than edit documents, I could easily have continued using it for 13 or 14 hours before the battery died. Even when streaming music or videos at full screen brightness, I usually get at least 4 or 5 hours out of it. The operating system is intuitive, well-designed, and easy to navigate.\n\nSo far as the physical construction goes, it's satisfactory. The device is extremely portable and lightweight, making it easy to carry around all day in a backpack/messenger bag/handbag/etc, and its small size is nice if you're working on a cluttered surface with papers or textbooks. The screen is nothing special, but seems clear and fairly bright, and gets the job done. Its webcam is actually pretty good, and delivers clear video at high frame rates, while the microphone is similarly decent. The keyboard and touchpad are both really quite high-quality and are excellent for long periods of typing; if you don't like using a touchpad, you can connect a mouse in less than a minute.\n\nNevertheless, the C270's plastic casing does feel a little cheap, and isn't the sturdiest  it's more or less what you'd expect from a $199 device. I've never dropped the laptop, but my screen cracked after about eight months of use and needed replacing (the replacement screen, which I bought as&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Acer-Chromebook-C720-New-11-6-Inch-WXGA-HD-LED-LCD-Replacement-Screen-30PIN-Matte-Fits-C720-2848-C720-2103-C720-2420-C720-2800-C720-2802-C720-2844/dp/B00JPJMRDA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Acer Chromebook C720 New 11.6-Inch WXGA HD LED LCD Replacement Screen 30PIN Matte Fits: C720-2848, C720-2103, C720-2420, C720-2800, C720-2802, C720-2844</a>, was pretty cheap and easy to install). Also, I've had a few minor dents or cracks in the casing around the USB ports  nothing that impairs functionality, but still something you might want to watch for. If you do a lot of typing, the areas of plastic where you rest your hands may start to wear after a couple months. Finally, at least on mine, the lid and lower panel don't seem to fit particularly well when the laptop is shut  there seems to be some areas where they rub together, wearing away plastic and slightly marking the screen. Fortunately, most of these issues can be fixed pretty easily if you clean it every few months and buy some protective accessories. I'd recommend a screen protector, one of those snap-on hard cases, and a sleeve, which in total will probably set you back about $25-30. It's not a bad investment for everything you get.\n\nOverall, the Chromebook can't do everything a more expensive PC or Mac laptop can, but I didn't feel like I was missing much. 95% of the time, especially in a work or school context, its surprisingly extensive combination of offline and online functions are more than enough. You get a very well-put-together operating system and an incredibly portable, lightweight laptop for a really impressively low price (For context, this entire computer cost me less than the graphics card in my gaming PC. There are headphones that cost more. You could buy five brand-new C720s for the same price as a 13\" Macbook Air). The construction might feel a bit flimsy at times, but it's a case of getting what you paid for  as opposed to every other area of the C720, where you get quite a bit more. The Chromebook is great as a second computer to carry around with you while your larger, more expensive one stays safely at home, and even if you don't have another computer, it's a fantastic option if you're on a budget."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "This was the first Chromebook computer I have ever purchased.  I was intrigued by Google's concept behind it: make a lightweight operating system based around Chrome with high quality parts for a very small amount of money, so I ordered the 11 inch, 2gb RAM version.  It arrived without any problems.\n\nSetup is very easy.  Simply plug in the laptop the first time you use it, open the lid, and follow the instructions.  All you need to do is sign into a Google account, log into a WIFI network, and all of your Google settings, history, and apps will be downloaded to the device.  It does not take more than a few minutes to get started.\n\nIt only takes a few seconds for this device to boot up.  Once you have logged in, you can get to work immediately, unlike many laptops running Windows or other operating systems.  The device renders webpages and apps almost immediately.  Even though this computer only has 2gb of RAM, the operating system is light and efficient enough to work perfectly with that small amount.\n\nThe battery capacity is impressive.  I have found that the battery lasts at least as long as advertised: 8.5 hours.  This, combined with the speed and efficiency of the device, makes it very practical for on-the-go productivity.  If needed, this device can go from off to spreadsheet in a matter of seconds, which can be useful in business meetings, university classes, and the like.\n\nThis device works well, but it only has a screen resolution of 1366*768.  That is understandable since it is only 11 inches, but most newer laptops ship with at least 1080p by default.  If this product were a few years older than it is, this screen resolution would be understandable, but it is a new product shipping with an inferior screen resolution.  This may have been deemed \"necessary\" to make the product cheaper, however.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this product to anyone looking for an affordable laptop of high quality that can get the job done."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I have been using this for just over six months and it is exactly what I require. It runs very quickly as long as you don't have excessive tabs open (mine slows down after eight or nine open at the same time) and there isn't much on it that I can't do. It took me a little while to find apps that suited my needs for both a writing program and a picture editing program, as it is web based, but those were the only two apps I had to \"seek out,\" everything else came already installed. It loads in seconds, it is very light and can be carried from place to place with one hand, and I like that it has a smaller sized screen and keyboard than a normal laptop but not as small as a tablet. It's battery life has stayed consistent over six months time and I rarely have to charge it- when I do it charges more quickly than I remember my more traditional laptop taking. I would definitely buy this again, and as it is very simple to learn how to use it would be a great purchase for someone not as tech savvy without losing any key components."}

I did check a couple out  at Best Buy before eventually ordering this one and found that the keyboard was manageable. Initially, it felt sort of cheap compared to other laptops but it has held up super well after a year of almost daily use. I use it at home to cast stuff to my Chromecast, take notes/write papers for school, surf online, edit church website (Wordpress CMS), and a ton of other stuff. Speakers on it aren't fantastic, nor is the screen quality, but if you want something that's going to hold up pretty well, hold a great battery charge, and be able to handle multiple programs running at the same time, this Chromebook would work out super well for you.\n\nAs a side note, before I bought this I was really worried because it was an Acer. I've owned Acers in the past and they've been junk. Talked to a dude at Best Buy and apparently (according to him at least) Google was really adamant about the specs for the Chromebooks since their name would be all over it.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "This is my travel laptop, now almost two years old.\n\nThe Acer and Amazon descriptions of this little computer are accurate. It does everything that is promised. And in the course of two years, banging around across two continents, I've seen almost no reduction in performance. The one exception to this is the right-mouse-click function on the touchpad. It's disappeared, making right-button menu functions unavailable via the touchpad. Since I prefer a separate mouse anyway, this doesn't affect me much.\n\nOther notes:\n\nPRO\n- as many have noted, booting up is amazingly fast\n- this laptop has lots of ports ... 3 USB ports, VGA and HDMI, an Ethernet port, audio out, SD card slot\n- if you love keyboard shortcuts, there are lots available (search online for a full list)\n- basic e-mail review and writing functions, and Google documents, can be set to work offline for syncing later when you have Internet access. Note that you have to choose and authorize these offline functions; they're not automatic out of the box.\n- PDF, photos, and multimedia files that you've stored locally can also be viewed/played while offline.\n\nCON\n- playing videos: some file formats are not supported (or audio is not supported and video plays silently). Search online for \"Why some videos won't play on Chromebook.\" This is one reason I added Ubuntu to the laptop (see below), so I could use VLC media player for those few video files I couldn't play on the Chromebook.\n- connecting to an external monitor wasn't very satisfactory; resolution seemed poor. However, the laptop works fine with digital projectors, more than good enough for classroom purposes.\n- can't transfer files to my 3rd generation Kindle Fire.\n\nABOUT ADDING LINUX\n- this is not supported by Google or Acer, but if you really feel the absence of some feature that only a locally installed program can provide, it's possible to add Linux ... Some online research will give you several ways to do this; I used the Crouton tool and chose the Ubuntu option, because I'm familiar with it from my desktop. I can switch back and forth between Chrome and Ubuntu with keyboard shortcuts. For most general purposes, this modification won't be necessary."}

I feel like I was caught in a scam, and that Acer is a dishonest company.\n\nIt is also not user friendly. simple things like cut & paste or spell check is not so obvious. The software was out dated when I bought it, and the computer and it would not update automatically, because I was using my data plan (i have an unlimited data plan), so I could not access netflix. I had to find a public wifi connection to update, it was quite inconvenient.\n\nThe ironic thing is I bought this device, because it has such great reviews, so I was compelled to warn people. No skype, software works only sometimes if at all, not user friendly. It's a piece of junk. Do not buy one."}

While there are things that you cannot do with a Chromebook, for my lifestyle, those things are minimal and I've been able to compensate with either other applications or figure out something else to meet my desired end.  I absolutely love the size, not too big and not too small, and it's so travel-easy.  I love the loads of free apps available through Google and many available to you offline.  I've had not one issue with my C-book thus far operationally or otherwise.  I can mirror my screen onto my TV.  I'm able to use Google \"Hangouts\" successfully.  I like the fact that it has both a \"Power wash\" button that removes all user accounts and resets the computer like new (I've not had to use it yet but just imagine being one button/touch away, if needed), and \"Reset Settings\" to restore settings to original default.  I was afraid to make the purchase initially but am thoroughly happy with it.  And, you most certainly cannot beat the price!  Navigating is easy with user-friendly touch on the keyboard.  Easy to figure out how to use upon opening the box.  For internet access, I've used both a hotspot and an ISP.  Files are available off-line and for edit.  After this experience, I doubt if I would ever return to a desktop or a larger laptop.  I would definitely, without question, purchase another Chromebook."}

It's also light in weight, a real convenient. Got to get used to the keyboard, though, not as wide as it looks or feels - but one gets used to it. Otherwise, product is just as described. 5 stars.\n\nUpdate as of June 2015 - battery lasts a little over 5 hours of continuous use, not 7 or more as is claimed. I'm a fast typer than the average, but after all these months, I still make mistake typing on this Acer C720 (on a regular keyboard when I use my PC at work, hardly any mistake); as mentioned before, keyboard is a bit unusual for my fingers for some reasons. But everything else remains true of this awesome laptop - rebott super fast, just like when I got it new. 5 stars remains my over review of this laptop."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "It boots up quickly and runs just as fast. I have multiple tabs open all the time and I don't feel like it slows down. Others may not like the keyboard and trackpad, but I think they're fine and really like how they feel. It doesn't feel cheap to me and it feels good to type on, although the most writing I do is typing up emails. Maybe it's not so comfortable for schoolwork. The trackpad buttons do feel kind of cheap and uncomfortable to click on, but it's not an issue for me since I use the trackpad for clicking. It also feels great that it's so light. It's nice for when I have it on my lap or just for general moving around and carrying in my bag. The fan works well and I love how it rarely ever gets hot. It won't burn my legs or whatever surface it's sitting on. The only times I've noticed it getting hot is when I'm looking at a lot of pictures and sometimes if I've been watching videos for more than a few hours. I've had the Chromebook for half a year now and haven't experienced any problems with it. No random restarts or slowing down. It's still as fast as the first day I got it. The battery still holds an awesome charge, unlike traditional laptops. I can't tell you what the battery life is exactly since I only have to charge it every few days, depending on how heavy my usage is. If I'm having an unusually heavy day of usage, I can drain the battery in maybe 6 hours. On my normal days of light web browsing and Youtube watching, it'll be 3-4 days before I have to charge it. This is perfect if all you do is surf the web and watch Netflix. If you need more than that, you might not be happy with this and a regular laptop or desktop computer would probably suit your needs better. I can see this Chromebook lasting for at least a few more years, which would get me beyond my money's worth. Even if it doesn't last that long, you can't beat the price and quality or find anything else like it."}

However, you are not able have any freedom on this piece of hud. Prefer windows 7 typing? Well screw you, you can only use google docs on here. I got this mainly for school so I was a bit flustered but thought I could deal with it. Until my english professor started docking me points on my essays because google docs wasn't putting in the correct format that I was constantly fighting with.\n\nWant itunes? Good luck buddy, that's not an option. You are not able to download, upload, or do anything if this computer is not compatible. With no cd/dvd port you basically have to download what you want onto a flashdrive on someone else's computer in the sheer hopes that this computer will recognize the content. With this i feel trapped and in a cage, never knowing what i can and cant do. Google controls your entire life if you use this chromebook.\n\n I honestly urge anyone to splurge the extra few dollars to get an actual pc or mac, because chromebooks will only bring you heartache in the long run."}

I did a lot of research before settling on a Chromebook, and then on this particular one; it suits my needs perfectly. It is light, portable, and extremely user friendly -- and, even more importantly, it is dependable. It is perfect for someone like me who needs a laptop for web use, email, social media, etc. I also take a LOT of photos, and have fallen in love with Google photos (which comes pre-installed). If you need a ton of storage, or something that can run intricate software, or if you are into gaming, this might not be the best choice (or, this may be a good option as a secondary pc, in lieu of a tablet)."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "There is a reason for the low price. This laptop is barely compatible with any of the software I need for work. I bought this because I needed a budget laptop and there were so many favorable reviews. I listened to the suggestion that it is useful if you convert google docs to word, use an online version of Windows, etc. I personally do not think the extra work is worth it. This is strictly for browsing, no heavy work use. I wanted to throw it out the window after I could not properly edit a word doc online. It kept giving me an error message. I do not recommend it, unless you are searching for a budget laptop solely for browsing the net. One upside is that the battery life is very good and typing on the keyboard feels smooth. Additional complaint, printing has become more complicated."}

To get it fixed (or probably replaced), I have to pay to ship it back, and they strongly recommend non-USPS, tracked, and insured shipping.

Not sure if it's the monitor or the system itself, but I plugged it in to charge it, wipe it, and let the bf use it. Nada. Nuttin. Sending it off to Acer for warranty repair.

I typically use a two hand technique where I swipe with right hand and then depress with left thumb. There are a number of times when the trackpad will erroneously register a rightclick action instead of a single click action. Now that I've had the laptop for a couple of months, there are times when depressing the trackpad is a bit flaky and it won't register the trackpad depress.\n2) the screen is quite easy to scuff, and mine has some scuff marks from the line of keys on the keyboard, which must have happened when the laptop was closed. As others have probably noted, the screen quality is OK - images and movies are OK.\n\nFor this price point (I got mine for less than $200), it's still a good buy, and I use it all the time because it is light, battery lasts a long time, and response is good, but don't expect perfection."}

The internet connection will disconnect every 30 mins and only reconnect when I manually turn off the wifi and switch it back on again. Happens whether I am using campus wifi, home wifi, or my apartment wifi. In addition, having more than a handful of tabs open makes the machine lag a lot. Sometimes if I leave it on too long, even two or three tabs will lag it. Probably the worst is that it has no Office. I don't mind using Google Docs; sometimes it can even be more convenient. But since this is my only laptop, I have no other alternatives to use when I am editing my Resume or working on a project. And Google docs is just absolutely AWFUL for this purpose. It messes up the format on my resume, even if I don't change a thing. Once I open a file on my Chromebook, the format is completely messed up. Oftentimes when I save Google Doc files to the hard drive, the format will save weird. Like there will be weird indents and the font will be different than what I had online. Once again, these issues would not be a deal breaker for a $200 laptop, aside from the fact that Internet is literally the sole function of a Chromebook. If I'm paying for a machine to do one thing, it better do that one thing damn well."}

Other then that the SSD is awesome, it's fast, it boots quickly, updates are done in the background and a little arrow on the bottom right shows up that the update is done and you just restart the computer (which is fast) to get it updated.

I knew the machine would be good, but I wasn't expecting it to be _this_ good! This $200 machine has same snappy performance as my work Macbook. And it manages to do this with a entry level Celeron processor, that's just insane. Boots up in 2-3s and shuts down instantly. The keyboard is good, though the keys aren't very deep. Trackpad is very accurate and smooth, I haven't seen a trackpad this good outside of a Macbook. Even though it has just 2GB ram, I haven't had even a slightest hiccup with multiple tabs/apps running with music streaming at the same time. I think Google has done an excellent job optimizing the OS, so much so that you get the same performance from entry level processors as an i3/i5.\n\nI initially thought that the small size could be a problem, but it hasn't been in my last few weeks of use. The resolution of the display is same as the other machines with 13in displays. I was so enamored by this small wonder that I decided to ditch my work Macbook and tried working on this for two full weeks. And I haven't missed a thing. Attach it to a external monitor and it handles a higher resolution equally well - no hiccups there too.\n\nMy only little gripe is that the Cisco VPN doesn't work out of the box (for certain types of authentication, for some others it works). I'm hoping Google or Cisco will fix that soon. But if you're a little handy, you can install crouton and vpnc to get it to work even now.\n\nAll in all, things don't get better than this. I haven't been more satisfied with any tech product as this. Tip of hat to Google and Acer.\n\nPS: The battery life is outstanding, I consistently get 8-9 hrs."}

I've tried multiple times to recover through the Chrome Recovery Utility to no avail.  Purchased 2 different USB drives after the first didn't work.  I give it 2 stars because when it worked, it worked great.  But I expected at least 12 months of use out of if, not a mere 6.  Oh, and I only got halfway through my GoGo Internet free passes during air travel.  Haven't felt this cheated since owning a Dell in the early 2000s."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I've had a 4GB C720 for almost two years now and even though the corners are showing the wear, it's still a great laptop with 8+ hours of battery life (after years!) and I use mine almost every day. It's been worth the couple hundred bucks and then some. The C720 seems to have been one chromebook that's been putting up a good fight and staying fast and modern while others fall by the wayside. Of course a couple components (like the screen) aren't great but the machine still overall works fine.\n\nI've used other chromebooks (mostly HP Chromebook 14s) and the C720 is comparatively faster, cooler, and quieter.\n\nI'd recommend the C720 if you want a lightweight, small, and relatively performant Chromebook without giving up full-size HDMI, USB 3, and awesome battery life."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "Read the many features on other reviews. This gives INFO not covered there.\n\nFirst, it does three things: it saved me from a MS rip-off when they cheated me out of $200; second it is a bridge between the Android and Windows OS; third it is a bridge between a larger laptop and a Tablet.\n\nBuying one used for about $100 allowed me to get out from under the $200 that MS locked me into in my 10 year old computer. Got stuck using an upgrade Win8 OS MS scammed me into. Its a long story. I won't it discuss here. I had thought there was no way out but Acer Chromebooks is my savior.\n\nChromebooks computers use a Google OS. It is a combination of their Chrome search engine and an independent operating system [providing a Windows alternative]. Chromebooks computers are available with an Intel or an Android CPU. Windows and Linux use Intel programming. The Android OS is designed for cell phones and tablets. Chromebooks is happy with either. This Acer uses the Intel CPU.\n\nI chose the Intel system because I feel it will be a better bridge to both worlds. The Google OS can use Android Apps and Linux. It does require an understanding of the software but it is do-able. No specifics here because details are available elsewhere on the Net.\n\nLast, its size is perfect for tablet users who like larger tablets. With a wide screen [less than 12 inches], it is slightly larger than a 10 inch tablet so it is considerably smaller and lighter than the average laptop. My wife is delighted as she prefers it to the three fragile tablets that died on her. She also likes the large mouse pad and its great keyboard.\n\nShe is addicted to You Tube, to reading her many books from B and N, or Kindle and to her online Bible sites. It does everything she wants from a tablet and computer. You may want more, that's for you to decide. I believe it will be more rugged than the tablets as well as having an increased range of modes.\n\nDepending on your application, I feel you will be happy with this. I tried to briefly cover things not mentioned in other comments. Hopefully this will raise some questions, which it is intended to do. Check it out. I think most tablet users will jump in. For laptop users, it may offer to little even tho it is a substitute.\n\nDedicated Windows users will continue to be MS slaves as MS becomes more manipulative and Machiavellian in forcing you to shell out for their stuff by blocking you from free and low cost alternatives. Be warned, suckers.\n\nAn afterthought: Google is a major player and will out strip MS soon. They will continue to increase the flexibility of Chromebooks FOR FREE. Ride their coat tails; you can't go wrong."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "Fantastic device.  I was dithering as to whether to get a fancy tablet or a new 'regular' light weight computer when I read the reviews on this.  The fact that you can use a Google app to access your regular computer remotely sold me on this device.  For the most part, I work in the cloud or on the web; this suits fine, is very portable and light and had great battery strength. If I need to carry files (e.g., wifi is iffy), I load to an SD card or carry a download of my regular computer along with me on a USB connectable hard drive.  Not as good as a connection, but nice in an emergency when connections may not be readily available."}

I love that but I cannot believe that Google still cannot figure out a way that I could print an HTML page (webpage). It only prints file attachments. (Remember, ChromeBooks do not allow installing drivers. So printing is very limited. The same goes for DVD players or CD players or even a USB external drive. Maybe the good part of limited print capability is that Google is training me to not take down so many trees ;) there are plenty of apps for it and I again I love the speed, light weight and display. It's a great deal for 60 bucks, but for $200 I'm not so sure.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I have been very pleased with the Acer C720!  The device is very light and portable while still powerful enough to perform the functions that I expect a Chromebook to be able to.  There aren't many well-known native ChromeOS applications in my experience so far, but luckily they aren't really needed.  I have had a great experience with Google Docs - I use it daily to collaborate with my wife on spreadsheets, grocery lists, and basic documents, and it is perfect for these things while I'm watching the kids in the living room.\n\nThe device can open multiple tabs in Chrome and play videos without any hint of lag, and that is about all that should be expected for this type of computer.  I chose this device in large part because of the Intel Celeron 2955U it is equipped with.  I was correct in my prediction that it would perform far better than the ARM processors at multitasking and maintain a respectable 7-8 hours of battery life.  While the newer Intel Celeron N2830 provides better battery life and the i3 processors are far more powerful, I have been very pleased with the 2955U's balanced performance/power ratio that compliments the mainstream computing that I wanted the Chromebook for in the first place.\n\nAs long as you look for a Chromebook with the realization that it will only be able to perform basic web-based functions, you will be very satisfied with this device.  The Acer C720 provides enough power for word processing, some video watching, and web surfing without wasting time with an underpowered processor or money with an overpowered computer."}

All the below was my original review and its still true, but this whine is annoying.\n\nSuper light weight (so is the OS) makes for easy traveling.

However, despite its limitations there are many workarounds and I absolutely love this. I don't think I'll ever be able to go back to a large screen laptop again.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I've had my Acer C720/2GB/16GB for 10 months now.  I bought a refurb for $149.  For that pittance, I have a wonderful little machine running 3 operating systems: Chrome OS, Linux via crouton, and Win 7 via Google Remote Desktop.  There's almost nothing I can't do.  Here's what I love about it:\n1. I love the form factor.  It's ultra-light and easy to carry from room to room.  Or from continent to continent, as I discovered on a recent trip to South America.\n2. The battery lasts forever.  I use the unit all day long, then plug it in to recharge when I go to bed.\n3. I'm very happy with the trackpad and the keyboard.  And I say that as a 60 WPM touch typist.\n4. I only recently discovered Remote Desktop.  The display died on my Win7 laptop, forcing me to relegate it to the bedroom, where, now connected to an external monitor, it has become a desktop.  No worries, though.  I have a pinned tab on my Chromebook giving me constant access to my Windows machine, whether I'm at home or on the road.  So now with my C720 I can run Word, Excel, Outlook, Photoshop Elements--you get the idea.  Of particular value personally is the ability to run Thunderbird, since I detest Gmail's web interface.  And I have the choice of cloud printing or routing output through my Windows machine to an attached printer.\n\nAll this for 149 bucks.  Unbelievable.  Some may ask, \"Dude, you're so enamored of your ability to access Windows; why not just get yourself a new Windows laptop?\"  Because the C720 is a far better solution for web surfing--which is what I spend 85 percent of my time doing.  To get a WIndows machine that a) wakes up in ~2 seconds when you open the lid and b) lets you surf with outstanding speed (see below for limitations on this), I'd have to spend several hundred bucks.  Then there's the bloatware, the updates, the anti-virus and malware overhead.  With the C720, I can enter the Windows world when I want to, while preserving the beauty and simplicity of the Chrome OS experience.\n\nI've just today figured out how to use the C720 and Remote Desktop to route music stored on my Win machine to my Yamaha receiver.\n\nBut I don't want to be too gushy.  The C720 has a couple of shortcomings:\n1. The display is just average.  You don't really notice this unless you're comparing it side-by-side with another display, but there's a bluish cast and the colors lack punch.\n2. If you're a tab slut like me, you will bump up against the machine's hardware limitations if you get over maybe 15.  The same thing will happen with fewer tabs if you hit a bunch of resource-hog web pages.  I had four different Facebook pages open in tabs today, each of which, according to Chrome OS's task manager, was using up several hundred megabytes of memory.  Things got slow fast.\nThese, of course, are shortcomings of the C720, but not of the Chromebook concept, on which I'm obviously sold.  Give me a unit with, say, an i3 processor, 4GB of memory, and an HD display, and I'll jump on it.  Meanwhile, I'm enjoying the hell out of my C720."}

Chromebooks are great for any basic things I normally do on the Internet, like Facebook and email.  It's also very helpful for basic word processing and spreadsheets.  For a minimal fee, I get cloud storage through Microsoft's One Drive.  I was able to link my Chromebook to my work computer, so I can work on budgets or projects on either one, and have the work available.  The \"save\" function is automatic.  It takes some getting used to, but I love it.  The speed can't be beat.  I love that without the download functions of a regular PC, I don't have to worry about viruses or slowdowns.  My chromebook is small, light, and minimalist.  With my mobile hotspot, I can (and do) use my Chromebook virtually anywhere.  Of course, I can also access wi-fi.  I do think anyone looking at a Chromebook should research how it works, and what it does, to make sure a Chromebook actually meets their specific needs.  I do think Chromebooks are a better choice for the somewhat \"tech savvy\", not so much for Internet novices."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "These are pretty much the perfect laptop for kids (and adults too if they don't want to download or install any personal programs).  The Google App store has just about every type of app/program you could want.  These don't have a DVD drive and you can't download programs unless they are from the App store.  It's a good way of keeping your machine safe from malware attacks.  No need to purchase and renew antiviral software.  The screen is clear and bright, and the keyboard works really nicely.  The sound from these is much better than the sound on my much more expensive laptop.  Overall, the size and functionality of the Chromebook is much better than my new Windows 8.1 laptop.\n\nMy kids were able to get started immediately with minimal help from me to download some apps they like, get their e-mails set up and started using these Chromebooks immediately.  I personally am not nuts about having only Google Chrome as my internet browser, thus I don't own my own Chromebook, but for my kids purposes (mainly games and schoolwork) the Chromebooks work out great.  I really like how easy and smoothly they work.  They are faster than my laptop and I do find that appealing, but I like being able to use a DVD drive and to be able to download what software I might want from the internet.\n\nPrinting is possible from the cloud and set up to do that is not difficult.  Everything is easy........almost too easy.  You can't store any data on the computer itself, only in the cloud.  But, I'm not worried about any personal information being accessed by nefarious types because there's really nothing to access.\n\nWe've had these Chromebooks since Christmas and they are still working fine with no problems whatsoever.\n\nUPDATE: 2.28.15 - My daughter brought it to my attention that these chromebooks do not have a \"delete\" key.

In any case, I found one locally, and I have been using it for nearly a year now, so this is more of a long term review.  I also have other Chromebooks as well, so it makes a neat comparison.\nFor its price, I find the device well built and solid.  At this price you can expect a lot of plastic, not the most expensive looking but given what Acer has to work with, the device looks surprisingly good for its price and better than many cheap notebooks.  It is also quite thin and light, despite not being a mobile processor inside its guts, feels easy and convenient to carry around, in fact, better than most small notebooks I have tried.\nThe keyboard has flat short travel keys, need a bit used to getting used to, unless you are used to ultrabooks and other thin notebooks where such is the norm.  Despite the short travel,  I find it easy to touch type and just let my thoughts carry me away.\nThe screen lacks saturation and brilliance, I think its precessor, the C710, looks better on that plus the C710 has a glossy screen.  Despite this, I find the matt screen on the C720 looking better than that of the Samsung 303 in my opinion, and will get the work done, plus video consumption without straining the eyes.  Not the best small screen, but still a pleasant experience.\nBattery life is exceedingly good, it feels more like a tablet at times for battery life, despite not having a mobile processor.\nPerformance is snappy, in the typical Chromebook fashion.  Expect those with Haswell processors like this one, to exceed those using current ARM and Bay Trail processors.\nI probably won't be exaggerating to see this is one of the best, if not the best, small notebook in the market.  I think this is a breakthrough product for Acer, a home run, despite having two early previous models of Chromebooks, this Chromebook model placed them on top of the Chromebook market, and helped led Acer's recovery this year.\nI would look forward to see Acer's successive models of Chromebooks, and see if they can topple this one."}

I got 1TB free as long as i keep the laptop\nPrice: the ratio of price to utiliity is great\n\nCons\nWiFi - pretty much a brick without wifi. all \"apps\" are browser pages\nBuild - keys are sturdy, but feel clunky, took so getting used to. Not CAPS Lock key, its a search button. Only two usb ports.\nStorage - must save everything to Google Drive\nPerformance: Can't really do much but watch video, browse and write. Can't do my podcast on this thing\n\nAfter three months, this is still a good buy. Would recommend. This is a poor man's Mac Air ;-)"}

However it has a crucial shortcoming for me personally. As an immigrant from Korea,I tend to download and watch a lot of Korean dramas. Many dramas can not be played on chromebook if they are a few years old. Strangely videos would play but not audio. How difficult could it be to modify OS to play many formats of audio?

I am 6'4\" with large hands and the keyboard is a good fit for me.\n\nOn a side note, at first, I thought I was having trouble with my track pad as other reviewers have claimed.  Then, I caught myself.  See, on the old windows notebook it had buttons that were not part of the track pad, they sat just below the track pad.  So my right finger when not typing would rest on the button.  On this notebook, I was resting my finger very gently on the button.  Problem with that is the button is part of the track pad so my cursor was going crazy or not moving as I was giving it multiple touch commands from the track pad.  After a week or so of learning not to do this, I have no issues.  Makes me wonder if this was the issue for anyone else.\n\nGreat purchase."}

The keyboard is adequate and is good for touch typing and am using the C720 to write this review. The trackpad is really good for a device of this cost. The screen is probably the weakest link but it is adequate for a couple of hours of work at a time.\n\nThe battery charged from 0% to 95% (I was impatient) in about 1.5 hours and showed 7 hours and 40 minutes at this level of charge.\n\nI was also able to find MS Word, Excel and PowerPoint Online now available for as Chrome OS apps (web apps) that allow native editing of MS Office documents. This review was written using the MS Word Online app.\n\nUsing Gmail and my work's Outlook for the web are perfect on the C720 for replying to emails and even drafting more lengthy emails and documents that are too long for a smartphone or tablet. I was also able to test some of my favorite websites and Chrome OS web apps including Duolingo, Lumosity, Spotify and Tweetdeck.\n\nI will next try some of the offline apps and even the offline Gmail to see how those work and to see how usable the Chromebook is without a Wifi internet connection. So far I can say that this is one of the best under $200 technology values I have seen and I like the simplicity but fairly robust productivity that the Google Chrome OS provides."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I've been using my Chromebook for about half a year now, and I'm still in love with it. It's light, boots quickly, charges fast and holds battery power like a champ. Since there are no programs, it runs incredibly fast. Not to mention, no one is making viruses for Chrome OS yet. If they do, the power wash function will clean up the computer and Chrome will restore your settings as soon as you log back in.\n\nKeep in mind, this is not a computer for the program obsessed. The Chromebook is an internet machine at heart and has no disc drive, no printer port, and cannot run PC or Mac programs. Internal storage is limited, but the direct connection to Google Drive has made that a nonexistent problem for me. The non-tech savvy among us who are still perplexed by the Cloud might struggle to adjust to an entirely online existence.\n\nI received some advice when I was thinking of getting a Chromebook and I will pass it on. Try running nothing but the Chrome browser on your computer for 1-3 months. Don't use Word. Don't use Paint. Livemail and Outlook Express do not exist to you. You cannot run games from Steam or play music on iTunes. If this isn't a problem for you, you're good to go. Buy yourself that shiny new Chromebook and enjoy quick internetting. If you can't do it, the Chromebook isn't for you or should only be used as a secondary portable computer to supplement the heavy one you keep at home."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "So, I did a lot of diligent reading and nervous speculation looking at chromebooks before finally ordering one. I suspect that many people, myself included, get sucked in to reading all these expert reviews and comparisons. The reviews and comparisons did nothing to assure me that I was ordering the best product for me, they just made me nervous and made me think that maybe I wouldn't be happy with the budget model, maybe I should spend more... I finally had a friend who owned one tell let me play with it briefly (5 minutes) and tell me that I should definitely get one, but make sure I get one with the i3 processor. That just made me research more, as I didn't know what the difference between the i3 and whatever I had been looking at was.\nAbout me: computer literate, I use a variety of products (think photoshop, illustrator), but mostly need something to access the internet while I don't have access to my wife's laptop. I have been surviving on an HTC one smartphone. I am already literate in the google universe, and already using google drive and evernote.\nI'm inclined to write this for several reasons, the first being that I deal with bicycles on a professional basis. I read the reviews. I ride the bikes. The difference between the bikes are subtle, only the most finicky of customers knows the difference. The same I believe is true here. There is nothing that I am disappointed with thus far - speed, battery, screen, etc. Granted, this is the only one I have owned or tested, but I am thrilled with the performance."}

I'm a college student who uses a desktop for all my \"heavy duty tasks,\" although as a Senior in college, I must say I've never needed anything more that powerpoint. I do use the desktop for a lot of gaming too.\n\nAnyways, I bought this to replace my old macbook pro that ran out of life after 5 years. I was nervous because I am very picky about keyboards and trackpads. The keyboard feels exactly similar to my old macbook, and I mean that as a very good compliment. It's super easy to type and does not feel small at all. This is not like a small tablet keyboard, your fingers will rest normally on the home keys (if you type that way like I do). The trackpad is beyond what I expected. I actually bought a USB wireless mouse preemptively, but will be returning it as this trackpad is also high end laptop comparable. It's perfectly responsive and has built in gestures. One thing I really like is how you can use a few fingers to actually switch between tabs on google chrome. This reminds me too, there are a lot of useful keys about the F keys that work with the chrome OS which is nice--you never press a key that does not work fluidly with the OS.\n\nLike a tablet, when you open the chromebook it is instantly on, which is a plus. The battery life has been excellent. Really nothing bad to say. When you hold it, you feel that it is made out of high end materials, yet it appears elegant and flush. In short, it does not feel cheap. Overall, I am a big google drive user and I love how everything instantly syncs with all of my coursework and documents.\n11/10, probably the most cost-efficient technology I have purchased in recent years"}

I use my IPad (2) for most things but needed a computer for printing, photos, etc.  Chose a chromebook over the Asus laptop.  Liked the idea I didn't have to pay for Office yearly, bother with updates, and virus safety.  I have taught myself Windows from DOS, all MS Office programs, NUMEROUS programs over the years related to my careers in healthcare  I have used PCs, laptops and tablets.  All that being said, I hate this thing!!\nStart up.  Like others, I had some trouble but called my cable compny and it was set up shortly.\n  Had some trouble transferring material from my laptop.  Couldnt use a flash drive due to the problems with the laptop. Most of the problem was my learning curve.  Took a couple of days.\n  The set up of files is different. I miss my 'directories, files, subfiles.\n  Today I spent about 7 hours filing out a 4 page form to obtain a vsa for ann upcoming \\trip.  Aside from problems with saving, finding the form(s), Printing is an issue. My traditional printer is wi-fi enabled and had been working.  It is not now.  I don t know why it stopped but you cant \"plug in\" a printer  to a chromebook.  I will now be buying a newer model printer.  There goes my savings on the annual MS Office fee!\nThank goodness I have long nails.  I use them to type rather than the ball of my fingers.  Keys are small and close together.  I knew this from reviews and just by the small size.  That (and the resulting typos) wouldn't be a problem but added to the major issues is only 1 more frustration.\n\nSharing?  Well, maybe, if I were still working. But we were able to share via Citrix, \"privileges\" and plain ole email attachments.  Retired, there's noting I would share that couldn't be sent via email.\nOh,  the Google search engine is powered by \"Ask\" which bis awful!  I know how to change search engines on a windows computer but now have to fingure out how (if?) it can be done on this thing.  \"Help\"  is not the greatest way to learn.  Will see if there's a \"Chromebook for Dummies\"\nAnother disadvantage:  it can't handle many common apps.  bought a Fitbit activity tracker.  You can't download the required app to a chrome book,  therefore, I can't use it.\n\nPros:  Aside from a long battery life and easy portability, I cannot think of any advantage over a \"\"traditional' laptop.  I can think of  numerous disadvantages.  I' have this over a month.  If it gets better, I will revise this review.  Part MIGHT be a greater learning curve than normal."}

After setting up the wifi and logging in, \"Chrome\" was set up just like my desktop and laptop; extensions, settings, bookmarks - all there.\n\nGetting used to the mouse-pad/track-pad and sometimes quirky keyboard layout has been the only challenge, albeit minor (the track-pad relies heavily on multi-finger touches and the keyboard loses a few keys normally found on a PC keyboard). The keyboard itself isn't bad but (for me) takes some getting used to over my Dell. Even so, after a few hours of typing its easily adapted to. I miss the back-lit keyboard from my Dell, but that too is a minor complaint.\n\nPros:\n* Thin and light\n* Battery life is excellent\n* screen quality is decent (considering the price)\n* Handles all my browser-based internet use perfectly.\n* Audio-quality is very acceptable from the speakers and mostly good using headphones.\n\nCons:\n* While it works great I'd still like to have a right and left mouse button on the track-pad\n* A back-lit keyboard would be nice"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I bought the Acer C720 Chromebook and I absolutely love it!  It was a purchase I made because I only had a desktop version and it became really slow and was very irritating to use as I wasn't a computer wiz and I never had any experience using a computer before I took an computer class of the basics and I just kept playing with it until I learned the crooks and craneys of how to use it for simple use. I felt skeptical at first of buying a laptop because I was scared I wouldn't be able to learn how to use it but believe me I was so wrong because the instructions to setup was well defined and very easy for even me and I was able to get it up and going all by myself and I didn't have to have my son to come set it up for me like I did on my desktop. The functionality and precise ease of use has been wonderful and the durability and materials are greatly crafted. I love,love,love my Acer Chromebook and I would highly recommend it to my friends and family and everybody. Thanks for a wonderful  product and it was the \"BEST\" investment I have ever made! GREAT JOB and it was greatly priced and one of the most affordable products of durability and craftsmanship"}

It is not touch screen (which I knew when I purchased it).  I decided to just buy a tablet or a bigger cell phone to play my scrabble and pinterest on.  I guess this would be good if you were farsighted or if you were a little kid, but for me, the smarter choice was a bigger phone or a bigger tablet.  If you want something small and sleek for doing word processing, spreadsheets, internet, etc., then this is not for you.  I would suggest a touch screen tablet with optional keyboard like the Microsoft Surface Pro 3."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "For the price this has been great. I recently graduated college and had an old refurbished Dell that basically only worked when it was plugged in and was extremely slow and couldn't play videos, so this was a definite upgrade. I mostly use it for Internet browsing and watching TV and movies. It's been perfect for that. It's extremely fast, has great battery life, video plays very well, and it's small enough to fit in my large purse if I want to take it to a coffee shop or something. The drawbacks: it doesn't have Skype, when I open Word documents the formatting sometimes looks off, the volume doesn't go super loud, the screen IS pretty small - similar to a tablet, so sometimes if there's very small writing or something I need to pick up the computer and bring it close to my face so I can see it lol. Overall though I'm very satisfied with my purchase. I've had this for several months and use it nearly every day."}

It is not overly complex and is quite user friendly for basic uses like watching YouTube, posting pictures on Facebook, etc. Downloading anything is a bit confusing but once you get the hang of it you should be good. My mom says it works like her smartphone with a similar interface and access to 'apps'.\n\nWhenever my mom has a question and I'm not around she will call the Google customer service. They are really nice to her about everything, answer all her questions even if it is not related to the Chromebook at all, and will even walk her through certain functions. A good example of this is my mom wanted to know how to access her YouTube account on her Chromebook because it didn't automatically sign in for her. Google customer support walked her through the steps and even helped her reset her YouTube password.\n\nWarning: You can not download Skype onto your Chromebook. There is no way, at this time, to get Skype. You will just have to make do with hangouts."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "Bought this for my daughter for Christmas.  As of today, it has a cracked screen.  Screen on the C710 and C720 series apparently have a stress point that will eventually cause the screen to crack just by opening and closing the lid.  And... when you have a daughter that carries it around like a personal buddy, it's going to happen sooner rather than later.  I have researched this and there are hundreds of cases of the 'spontaneous' cracking screen.  Of course, it's your fault as no manufacturer (including Acer) will acknowledge that they may have under-engineered the portable device for 'portable' use, but that aside, it is what it is.  I'm contacting Amazon today to see about returning the product.  Funny thing is, I bought a protective case for this since it was so light and thin.  Guess that's a wasted purchase as well considering that there's not a scratch on this thing.  Perfect... flawless, no dings, no drops, no scratches... just a cracked screen with no apparent damage other than if you open and shut the lid with your LEFT hand from the upper left corner of the screen, it will eventually snap internally and crack the screen.\n\nShort of the screen crack, loved the unit itself.  Performs as expected and runs as it should.  Good battery life... just a horribly designed screen that will eventually crack spontaneously."}

Google apps are a more watered down version of other documentation systems without all of the bells and whistles. Honestly, who needs over 100 different fonts! Most people use only a handful and more often even less. It literally takes me less than 7 seconds to power up and log on. It's perfect for Facebook and Netflix.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "Posting as an average college student from Florida. It's perfect for my everyday needs of surfing the web, sending emails, downloads, streaming movies and music and doing homework assignments. It's quick, battery is good and have had no problems in the 2 months so far that I've owned it. It's perfect for me. The only reason I took off a star is because there is no storage unless it is online and I'm not tech-savvy enough to really figure all of that out yet. Keep in mind that this is NOT a laptop, it is a chromebook. I did not know that, however I am MORE than satisfied using it as my everyday laptop and it does the job just fine :) I also like that it is almost impossible to get a virus on.\n\nI use the HDMI port and the only thing I can say is that it might not work unless you go to your settings and click \"mirroring\" because before I did that, it would not display on the screen.\nBesides that, everything ran as smoothly as I like it."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "Bought this for the family as a secondary laptop for the kids to do schoolwork on and it's great!  Very lightweight, fast, and perfect for using the web, email, streaming video or music, and getting schoolwork done.  It has multiple user accounts, so that's definitely a positive change from previous Chromebooks.  Performance has been great, no trouble getting work done and using on any websites.  You can't beat this computer at this price point for its price-point, performance, and portability.\n\nI was a bit concerned with the smaller screen size, but it's not an issue when you're just using the device for web browsing and video streaming, and the built in full screen mode is great.  The screen isn't the greatest out there, others have pointed out that it's the same size and resolution as the MacBook Air screen, but the color is definitely not as great, and I don't think it's the screen itself, but rather the protective cover over it that has a rather odd graininess to it you won't notice it unless you look for it though.  The speakers are quite astounding for a device of this size, easily beating out our MacBook Pro's speakers in volume and quality.  Trackpad feels small coming from the giant and smooth glass one on a MacBook, but its the best I've used on a non-Apple computer, and is more than adequate.  Keyboard does feel a bit cramped, but is very usable even for someone with very large hands like myself.  I haven't heard the fan turn on once, even with 20+ tabs open and HD video streaming, which is awesome.  Overall construction is great, feels solid, although the lid does collect fingerprints quite easily.\n\nI've noticed that it sometimes has a bit of a stutter when opening new tabs (only if twenty plus tabs are already open, and this is a very minor visual issue, something most people probably wouldn't notice).  It does slow down noticeably if you have HD video streaming and try to work between several other tabs at once, but this isn't usually an issue since I don't normally use the computer much when I'm watching something on the screen already.\n\nThe only things I might change would be to add a backlit keyboard (spoiled by the MacBook, and that's crazy to ask for at this price point) and also allowing the user to remap the keyboard as they like.  The built in keyboard forces you to use alt-caps lock to use the caps lock as normally, otherwise it's a search button, which is pretty redundant because you can search just by opening a new tab in Chrome (there could be a way to remap that I just haven't found in settings yet.  Also, the ability to declare/change the device to have multiple 'owners' would be great.  There are some more advanced settings that seem to only be able to be changed by the 'owner' of the device, which as far as I can tell is just the first user to have logged in to the device.  As others have pointed out there isn't a Skype app either, which forces you to use Google Hangouts.  Not sure if this is intentional on Google's part or if Skype just hasn't made a chrome app yet.\n\nOverall, a great computer in general, and an absolutely killer deal at this price.  This is the perfect computer for you if you don't need to anything beyond surfing the web and streaming video, which is probably about 90% of users these days."}

The unit starts quickly and no problems with browsing / loading pages - even with multiple tabs open. The display is bright and crisp and battery life is >8 hours.

We had no trouble getting Google Cloud print to work by routing print jobs from the cloud through an old Windows XP desktop wired to an 18 year old laser printer.

I ended up buying this Acer and it has not disappointed me. I ended up actually ditching all my apple products and converted to Chrome processing everything. It was a little weird to get used to at first because it's running off apps, but I love it and I won't ever go back to a normal/expensive laptop. The chromebook has everything that I need as far docs, music, netflix, internet (most importantly) and a long battery life. We're talking 12+ hours.

Note that to do this, you must enable developers mode (note that any negative side affects that occur void the warranty). A brief search online of 'how to run applications on a chromebook' would be of use to any people curious. However, the low specs of this computer make it so that you can't run certain applications anyways (I suggest you search up the minimum requirements of the programs and see how they relate to this pc's).\n\nOverall to the average user I say:\nYES BUY IT IF YOU:\n  1) Are looking for a school computer\n  2) Looking for a work computer\n  3) Looking for a casual NON GAMING computer to surf the web\n\nWhile I don't personally have experience with other chromebooks, this one is amazing for the price"}

Friggin half hour boots ups and virus scan spam and nonsense windows errors. I had heard rumors that chromebooks solved these problems sort of like that old lady at Hardees back home has been solving my biscuits and gravy fix for the last couple decades. Amazon had them November special for 25% off (regular price $199) so I justified the purchase to myself in terms of frustration eliminated and recreational time gained and pulled the trigger. The damn thing does not disappoint. It's basically the beautiful hybrid of a smartphone and laptop. My biggest frustration with laptops is the battery life. I go days without charging -> this little guy sips electricity and I have the juiced up haswell and not the bay trail efficient innards. Other laptops I've used would have trouble getting through a movie without going dead with the screen brightness turned way down. The other super nice thing is turn on and shut down times. I open the screen and BAM -> it's on. No wondering what the hell processes are going on or clicking on something and then do my taxes and finally it has completed the click. Shut down is just as instantanous. Literally approx 1 sec.\nI've heard some naysayer talk like \"I can't run my 150GB graphics intensive program thingy\" and it's techie nonsense. Gen-pop use cases irl probably 95% facebook and web browsing so you're more than good. They say this because it runs on chrome os and not windows so certain functionalities don't exist but I haven't run into anything yet and don't foresee any in the future. The other limitation per se is the 16 gb ss hard drive which doesn't mean much to me. swing pics all the time on my 8gb phone and haven't hit the ceiling. Dunno if still going on, but I even hit the google special where you get an extra TB google drive for free for a couple years.\nOne of the Amazon reviews said something like stop thinking about it, just get it and you won't regret it.

EDIT 1 YEAR LATER - i truely enjoy using this acer c720 chromebook because it is so fast and simple.  in fact i have bought 2 more.  there are still some things it won't do, so i keep an old toshiba laptop going for when i need it.  it has worked flawlessly UNTIL TONIGHT, STAYING IN A MOTEL, THE TRACK PAD STOPPED WORKING WHEN I PLUGGED IT INTO THE DESK.  it worked again when i unplugged it.  i moved the power supply to another wall socket across the room and it worked perfectly again.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I LOVE my Chromebook... however.. there are a few things you should be aware of:\n\nI am typing this on the 3rd Chromebook Ive purchased.  They are very easy to break.. the other two went to the electronics graveyard as one fell of my table and the screen ceased to work.. the other I tripped and fell on (too many Martini's..) But I keep coming back for more.. as again I'm typing this on my 3rd Chromebook.. so obviously I'm hooked on them.\n\nThe keyboard is very easy to use.. it has the chiclet style of keyboard and it is very easy to type on.\n\nMost of the changes you make to your computer will be made online.. there is a row of command buttons at the top of the keyboard (like F1 keys on a standard keyboard).. but everything that can be changed via these keys.. can also easily be changed onscreen as well. (Sound, brightness, etc.)\n\nThis is NOT a PC.  So if you buy this expecting run the same programs that you are running on your Windows PC or MAC, unless there is an equivalent to that in the Chrome Store (e.g. Microsoft Office - Google Docs would be the equivalent) .  BUT, keep in mind there are thousands of applications available in the Chrome Store that will more than likely fit your need. (It's like an app store for the chromebook) Honestly though - I rarely find myself using any of the apps from the chromestore.. I've downloaded a bunch (Spotify, YouTube and a few others..) but I find it's much easier to just use the online version.\n\nBUT - since the browser is the Chrome Browser.. nothing beats the awesome plugins you can add to your Chrome Browser.\n\nThis is NOT an ideal piece of equipment for gaming.  I feel silly saying this as I feel this is common knowledge.. but still some people don't know this.  YES, there are games that can be downloaded from the Chrome Store, but they are the equivalent to downloading an APP and playing them on your smartphone.  Casual Games mostly.  Online flash games are hit and miss.  So if your intention is to use this to play lots of games - this may not be for you.\n\nThis device is perfect for:\nSurfing the internet\nWatching your streaming entertainment online: Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime shows.. etc. (install the Hola plugin.. it will change your life)\nOnline shopping (seriously install the \"PriceBlink\" plugin.. it will really change your life.)\nSending emails\nSocial Media stuff\nWord processing (Google Docs)\nOnline video chatting (Google Hangouts works pretty great)\n\nAll the basics.  The other fabulous thing about this Chromebook is how long it holds a charge.. battery life is great!  I could get several days out of mine.. UNTIL.  My battery stopped charging.\n\nApparently this is a know issue with the C720.. that they will just stop holding a charge.  I've had my Chromebook for about a year and it is no longer under warranty. I haven't started looking into what I need to do to fix this issue.. it's either a dead battery or some other issue.  I don't like dealing with tech support.. so I may just say forget it and buy a real PC.. there are so many great deals out right now.  Just be advised of this known issue.  I can no longer take my Chromebook anywhere with me.. which stinks as it is so small and light it easily fit into my tote bag.  I feel I've lost a very valuable feature and it makes me sad face all day every day."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "Chromebooks are fine if all you want to do is surf the net and do only internet related things. I got my chromebook on Black Friday. I do not particularly like it. Why break away from windows if your going to cause a world of trouble by not being compatible with things that we normally use? My first annoyance and outrage:- I download videos from youtube for teaching purposes, I am outraged that there is a policy that prohibits me from downloading youtube videos. What happens when I need to make presentations in a place where there is limited, or slow, or no internet access? Annoyance number two:- why would you make a pc that ask me to either invest in a cloud printer or get a windows, yes good ole windows pc with a google chrome browser to add my regular printer to then, there is some ridiculous setup process that will allow you to print from your chromebook using a windows computer for people like good ole me who has a regular $20 printer. I do not have another windows pc. I only have this one and I only bought it because my old windows pc decided to stop working. Annoyance number three: everyone uses word, now its fine that there is word online but it will not give you the features that you get with a full Mircosoft Office Suit that you will get with your regular windows pc. The microsoft and other office applications  are so basic that its and outrage, it like an upgrade from regular phone text messages. I am sure as time goes on I will discover more things that I am accustomed of doing with my regular windows pc that I will not be able to do with this chromebook. All in all the experience with this productivity wise is a far cry from what you can expect with windows. The only thing that gets me is that it is super light, boots in 7 secs, long battery life and fits well into a purse but I can not really do what I want when it comes to assignments and the creation of presentations.  I am going to be getting a windows pc the next time I find one on sale. This sucks."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "Having been a Windows user ever since Computer Cave Man days I was intrigued by the Chromebook platform after my trusty Dell laptop passed on and needed to buy a new portable machine. I use a desktop as my main \"work\" computer as it has all the tools I need for every conceivable task, yet the truth is that 98% of my time is spent writing or else engaged with the web. Of course, when I really need those Windows only tools, it is a huge boon to have them so I could not conceive of a Chromebook as my main working unit. But since my dell laptop was used exclusively for casual tasks and web access, the Chromebook seemed promising as it could do pretty much everything I needed.\n\nAfter considerable research I decided that a C720 was the right choice. I did have a few reservations due to the inevitable quibles and negative reviews, but the positive were so overwhelming and the price so irresistible I decided to take the plunge and like so many people I am simply blown away not only by the Chromebook experience, but also by the incredible quality of the C720.\n\nLet me start with the Chromebook ecosystem: If Windows can be compared to a Tractor-Trailer, Chromebook is like a finely tuned Harley Davidson. Everything that people praise is absolutely true - the fast boot up time is a delight, not having to constantly monitor and update all my programs is a huge relief, but something not a lot of people express is the excellent design and simplicity of the graphic interface - it's simply a pleasure to use and engage.\n\nThe C720 also completely surpassed my expectation. All my notebooks have been top of the line corporate machine costing over $1,000, so I didn't expect much for under $200, especially when many reviews labeled it as being dull and somewhat pedestrian. On the contrary, it feels solid and well built and the colors elegantly understated. People complain about the screen - I really don't understand why - I suppose they are comparing it to the latest retina, but compared to my older dell it is spectacular. The keyboard as well - I am a keyboard fanatic and am completely delighted with it. The touch pad also is excellent - again I don't understand why some people complain - again after the rudimentary Dell touchpad, this one is a dream.\n\nI do miss not being able to connect simply to a printer - I suppose this is due to a drivers issue so a necessary sacrifice - not a big deal considering everything in favor, so not a big deal. There is also a slight blurring when you scroll text - I have seen that the C720 has a lower refresh rate than other computers - but again something I can live with.\n\nSo like so many people, the C720 and the Chromebook interface both get 5 stars. I make it clear again that the chromebook is not a substitue for Windows, it's a refreshing and delightful complement. Hopefully the machine will last - I do see that some people have issues crop up after a few months of use but type any computer manufactures followed by the words \"problems\" or \"issue\" and you will get billions of hits - it comes with the program!"}

I am usually very hesitant to buy a product online, but having dealt with Amazon many times before I was willing to buy this product and test it out for myself.\n\nPro: The speed of this computer is amazing! Boot-up in about 4 sec's.\n  The usability is great for surfing the web and Google chrome products, I Google for all my military doc's and personal doc's and it makes the transition super smooth.\n  The battery life does actually last all day when I am not using the computer my wife uses it for personal use and it can handle a full day of surfing the internet from morning to night without having to recharge throughout the day.\n  There are plenty more amazing features that I could add but I really don't feel like writing that much so if you want a nice reliable compact computer this is the one!\n\nCons: Seems a bit fragile, but after having it for over a month it still is working great."}

It was so simple and user friendly that I gave it to my mother to use. She used to call me almost every week to fix her Windows 7 computer. After I gave her the Samsung Chromebook, I hadn't had to fix her computer since then. That computer lasted her until earlier this year when she spilled coffee on it, so I bought her this Acer c720 Chromebook and she loves it.\n\nI have also bought myself one of these since then just to use it when I need to type a long email, or write a review like this one, which aren't easy to type on phones and tablets.\n\nThe good:\nDurable\nLong lasting battery\nDecent screen\nEasy to use\nGood touch pad (mouse pad)\nSpeakers are pretty good for a $200 laptop\n\nThe bad:\nThe keyboard isn't as click-able as any other keyboards I use. Sometimes you have to press the key twice especially when typing fast. If you're okay with typing a little slower to make sure you press each key completely, you will have no issues.\n\nOverall:\nIt doesn't get better for a $200 laptop."}

Like other reviewers I don't like the track pad so much, but it's not unbearable. Otherwise everything is smooth and easy. I would even recommend this for the senior crowd because it's so intuitive and easy.\n\nUpdate 6 months later: I am still madly in love with my Acer. Had a friend by a different brand Chromebook and it crapped out on him within the first month. Here's me happy as a clam working this thing hard.

The only issue she has mentioned at all is not being able to print, but it's Christmas time now, so I guess I'll be getting her a $50 compatible printer, problem solved. So basically this seems to be a very user friendly easy to use computer that is fast and perfect for the tech challenged that just want to surf, email, youtube, facebook ect.. I knew she wasn't a hardcore gamer or graphic designer, film editor or anything that required anything more powerful than this unit, and it seems to be a perfect fit.

I edited a powerpoint talk and saved it in ppt. I am writing a book chapter on it right now. Oh, we watched Hulu and Amazon Prime yesterday on a Chromecast with a download speed of  2mbs. It was perfect. I have had a macbook air, its gone now, and all the windows stuff. I don't see how I can use a Chromebook to edit and save a Microsoft Access database (pm me if you know how to do this).  This Access issue and the power plug at a 90 degree angle are the 2 things that take a star off. This is better than the Samsung Chromebook in my opinon having used them both."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "Great for what I got it for. I bought this knowing full well that I would spend zero time with ChromeOS. First day, I voided the warranty to pull out the write protect screw from the motherboard, threw Arch Linux onto it, setup Arch the way I wanted it, and now I'm using it as a hub to my desktop running Windows 8.1 via Rdesktop. For other stuff I do, some basic C programming and such, it handles it all on its own very well. It also provides you with the ability to easily expand storage via an M.2 SATA SSD, not standard MSATA but the 42mm variety of M.2. I found one on amazon, a 128GB one for $60, so I am probably going to upgrade that at some point. For the $150 I paid for it, it has certainly turned into a good daily driver, at least with the full fledged operating system I put on it. My only complaint is that the screen is a bit sub-par, washed out colors from any angle really, finding that sweet spot is nigh impossible. Keyboard is reasonably comfortable to type on, it just does not have the caps lock key, though I'm sure Arch provides me with a way to repurpose the search key as a caps lock key. If you're like me, and wanted a test bench for all your latest mods and hacks, this is definitely a safe bet, even at the $200 price point it is at now."}

The size is perfect for travel and for business trips!\n\nWhat I actually use this laptop for is for email, coding, research, and the occasional internet browsing (i.e. news and youtube). These are all for work related purposes.\n\nSo far after several hours of heavy usage here is a summary of my impressions: Entire laptop feels and looks strong and not cheap. Keyboard use is nice and smooth. Mousepad works well. Very quiet because it is fanless. GREAT BATTERY LIFE.... Laptop works very well in my workflow since I use Google Apps. Also it is lightweight, has 3.0 USB and 2.0 USB, SD card slot, HDMI, and earphone jack. Just note that because of the USB ports, the laptops internal storage of 2 GB is nothing to worry about.\n\nJust know that the last laptop I ever bought was in 2006 and they were insanely expensive, heavy, and the battery life sucked compared to this c720. Due to the nature of my work,I moved to custom built heavy-duty PCs ( 16GB+ ram, quad core cpu) . Since most laptops do not have premium specs such as premium PCs, I never really had any interest in laptops because it seemed like a waste in money.\n\nFast forward a couple years, I needed some mobility and the tablets (ipads and androids) I have bought for work were enough. They were small, good battery life, and very easy to use. The only thing was the price.... for an ipad you are looking at $400+. For an Android, you are looking at 300+.\n\nSo with the c720, @ less than $180 and with all the latest hardware (sdd, free apps, built-in security, AWESOME BATTERY  life)... This is a no brainer.."}

It started off with the keyboard buttons executing different commands which was every once in awhile and not a big deal. The case holding the LCD screen is flimsy and extremely cheap and gripping my laptop caused the screen to crack a little, but Acer wouldn't do anything which I also was fine with. The screen started bleeding from the minor cracks but I kept using it. Now the mouse track stopped working and that was actually more annoying to me than the other flaws, but they refused to fix this because my LCD screen is cracked. It has nothing to do with the faulty track pad and the rep admitted it but said it is Acer's policy. This is a known problem too. I searched for this problem online and it is prevalent.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "This device is well worth the $150, only because it's so easy to install linux on it.\n\nI never planned on using chrome OS in the first place, but I'll review it anyway. It's about what you'd expect if you didn't do much research into, since you were planning on installing linux. You login with your google account, it loads all your settings, and then everything opens up in chrome. You click on email, it's a web link to chrome. Music, youtube, docs, etc, it's all in the chrome browser. I like that it has a guest account that just has chrome and no access to your files, so if you want to let a family member or friend use it for a short while. The touchpad is neat. You can swipe with 2 fingers fast left or right to go forward or back on web pages. I've never had a touchpad with multitouch support. Normally I'd plug a mouse in and use that, but this touch pad is usable enough that I don't need to. Chrome OS is pretty useless. There isn't even a decent IRC 'chrome app' or whatever they call it. Along with most things you would do on a computer having either a very poor app, or none at all.\n\nSo, you put Arch Linux on it and everything is better. No really, now you have an actual computer you can do things on. Everything works as expected.\n\nOnly complaints are: No delete, page up, page down, home, end, keys on the keyboard. the fn keys replace the F keys. They look like the F keys to linux, but the picture on them are pictures, not F1 F2, etc. Caps lock key is replaced with a little search icon, which in linux looks like a Super key. The SD card sticks out halfway instead of being one of those spring loaded ones. Gotta be careful you don't accidentally break it off because it sticks out so far.\n\nThe screen looks OK to me. Nothing that I'm complaining about, but I've been using a TV as a monitor for a while now, so I've probably downgraded my expectations.\n\nThe keyboard keys are also kind of annoying. You can only push them a very little bit, so there's a lot less tactile feedback than normal resulting in a lot more typos than normal."}

I'm sending it back too for a refund this time. I really wanted this to work for me, but it's useless without a stable and fast Wi-Fi connection.\n\nGoogle search for \"C720 wireless issues\" and you'll see plenty of other people have had these issues or similar issues.\n\nMine first one, wireless would connect (eventually) and would be really slow (1Mbps) but at least it wouldn't drop. Loading a basic webpage was fine most of the time, but anytime you needed something more... it would just stop responding and the webpage timeout until you hit the refresh button.\n\nThe 2nd one wouldn't even stay connected. It would connect much faster than the first one, but then quickly die. Nothing but disabling and re-enabling the Wi-Fi would get it working again. Once it was working, it was fast(er) but it typically died so fast that it just wasn't worth keeping.\n\nFWIW, all my other devices (Apple iPhones/iPads, Nexus 4, Laptops, Desktop PCs, etc) all work just fine and hit their peak throughput or my ISP max downstream (~50Mbps or approx 5-6MB/s). None of them disconnect randomly, or just stop working. I have tried two different wireless routers (netgear nighthawk and my ISP provided device). I tried DD-WRT on the Netgear as well as stock. I tried every channel that it let me choose. Each time it was exactly the same.\n\nIt's the poor quality Wi-Fi chip Acer used, plain and simple."}

At first, when I opened the box, I was skeptical since the display looked horrible and the overall build quality seems feeble. But in using it for a few days - I have started liking and almost loving this little cute machine. Display is the only negative on this C720 - but for the price you can't get anything better. And once you start working and overlook the quality of the screen - then it doesn't come in your way. The trackpad works perfectly fine. The keyboard is actually amazing. I love the soft clicky feeling. I love typing on this machine more than on my Dell. This product is perfect for online browsing (multiple tabs), watching YouTube and working on Google apps. You can read Office files easy and creating/editing Office files (via Google apps) is limited in functionality of course. It's really light and small and makes this a very portable machine. Remember, don't think you are purchasing a computer that can run programs, iTunes, Excel, etc. This is just like a tablet with a physical keyboard and a much more practical work machine than a tablet is.\n\nThis should be bought for:\n1. Browsing web, social media, YouTube videos, etc.\n2. For those who like keyboards vs. touch screen.\n3. For taking notes, heavy browsing (comparison shopping, booking vacations, etc.) is where this wins over a tablet.\n4. Frequent flyers and Google power users.\n5. As a couch computer.\n\nThis should NOT be bought for:\n1. Being a primary machine on which you can run programs and do tons of work.\n\nSome tips to make this machine even better:\n1. Set the zoom level from settings to 125% and set the default font size to large.\n2. When reading articles or websites - press the 5th button from the left on the top. That will make the view full screen. Really nice.\n3. Baby this product, it is feeble and gets scratches easily.\n4. Set brightness up to a higher level - will making reading easy.\n5. Try the two finger down/up gesture for scrolling - really nice.\n6. Try the two finger left and right gesture for moving back/forward on web pages when browsing.\n7. Try a three finger swipe down - to switch tabs.\n\nThe one thing I am worried about is how long will this machine last. I will update this post in 3, 6, 12 months with status on how well this machine has held up over time."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I have had my c720 for a little over 4 months now and it is holding up fine. The c720 pros for me include: very compact, semi-light, great battery life, nice multi-touch mousepad, and great battery life. There are caveats however such as a rather shallow keyboard (I like a longer and deeper keystroke), non-backlit keys, uninspiring display (limited viewing angle and so-so colors but still usable), and an SD card reader that leaves your card mostly sticking out. Also structurally I feel it is not very robust so I definitely try to baby it. I have a purple hard cover that protects the lid and base plus I also have a sleeve for it when I put it in my bookbag. Between jaunts to campus and errands it is still working fine!\n\nMy overall feeling is that trade-offs should be considered. The biggest one is the price. It would be very hard to find a compact, nimble, and low-priced laptop like the c720 if it had a backlit keyboard and an IPS wide-viewing angle screen. With those features I am quite sure the price would easily increase accordingly. During the last 4 months I have found I can live with the drawbacks.\n\nFor those who say it is limited. I have recently installed linux to run alongside chromeOS. The linux distribution I am running is 14.04 Ubuntu XFCE. Since XFCE is a full-fledged operating system I am able to install actual programs. So far I have installed:\n\n-WPS Office (great looking MS Suite type of program; incl. word processor, excel, powerpoint)\n-Steam\n-qpdfview (nice lightweight PDF program; can annotate PDFs)\n-Chrome browser\n-Firefox browser\n-VLC\n-Clementine (music, radio program)\n-XBOXdrv (lets me use the XBOX360 controller for steam games)\n-Spotify\n-Cheese (web cam program)\n-Gimp (Photoshop alternative)\n-Transmission (torrent utility)\n\nThe significance of running linux is that I can use the word processor in a more full-featured way offline. I am even able to hook my printer directly to the c720 and print due to available linux drivers for my Brother HL-2240 laser printer. Another nifty feature is that since chromeOS is still present I am able to log-out of linux and jump right back into chromeOS without rebooting. Getting linux set up to my liking so far has taken some time (~one day). I am still working on getting the chromeOS gestures to work similarly on the linux side. If you are interested you can search engine Crouton and find resources that will detail the procedures to install linux and associated tradeoffs.\n\nIn conclusion this makes the c720 very versatile while doubling as a pretty great learning device as well!  Next step is to install a 128gb M.2. SSD to replace the 16gb one. All in all I do not regret my purchase!\n\nUPDATE 12/16/2014\n\nI purchased a MyDigitalSSD SuperBoot Drive 128gb M.2 42mm SSD to take the place of the stock 16gb M.2 SSD. I started out by making a recovery USB. Also backed up my Chroot (my Linux install). The installation was not too bad. I did get a little confused on unpacking the tar.gz backup of my linux install but I finally sorted it out. The ChromeOS was easier. As soon as I logged into my account all my bookmarks appeared and my wallpaper. Sitting pretty w/the c720 now :)"}

I purchased the 32GB flavor, and on the 32nd day I noticed that my screen would show white lines with the display open when awaking from sleep mode. Started the warranty process 1st week of July 2014.\n\nContacted Acer Outlet's warranty office, who initially wanted me to send them a video BEFORE the shipping label. Sent them a video after obtaining the shipping label and when I got to it, dropped it off at UPS after of course Powerwashing it. Received the CB back...with the same problem. The work order stated that the screen was replaced. I saw small indents near the screen to suggest it, but, it wasn't fixed.\n\nOnce again, contacted the warranty office, who once again requested a video. Sent the video, they sent the label, I sent the CB, and once again, I receive the same CB back. This time, the WO says \"Chrome OS updated\". I could have updated that my dang self!!! It wasn't fixed.\n\nONCE AGAIN, I contacted their warranty dept, but this time I cc'd Amazon Acer Outlet and in full detail explained to them the issue. Acer Outlet to their credit seemed to care more than the warranty dept, but, once again I sent the video, they sent the label, I dropped it off to UPS....\n\n....SAME ISSUE!\n\nNow, we're in late Sept at this point, as  my wedding is creeping nearby and I wanted a CB to use on my cruise. Obtained one for my now wife, and I was going to focus on getting a new CB sent to me. Acer Outlet instead stated they'd refund it to me. PERFECT! I was excited. They sent the label, for the 4th time I dropped it off at UPS...\n\n...and on Oct 17th, a day before my cruise, what do I see at my doorstep???\n\nThe now beat up box the CB came in. Same silly \"Updated Chrome OS\" WO attached to my CB! Same issues! So shoot, the CB went with me to Mexico for a week! I decided it needed a vacation.  Obviously Acer Outlet does not communicate at all w/their warranty vendor....even when they said they would handle it.\n\nEventually after having to almost plead, I was finally granted another shipping label, but this time I noticed the return address wasn't mine, so I had hope it wouldn't come back to me.\n\nIt arrived at the destination point in the normal 3-5 business day range, but, finally after the 2nd week of waiting for a response, I contacted Acer Outlet again. I was initially told I had to wait for their finance dept. I just showed them the tracking number, and FINALLY, I received the email from Amazon that a refund was issued to me!\n\nLong story short: buy new, and hope that if you have any issues, that it's within Amazon's return window. Else, you'll potentially have to deal with what I had to endure. Nearly 5 months of torture. I had to write this to tell my side of the story public, as I'm sure others have had similar experiences and may not have followed through to completion such as I did.\n\n*Now, the CB itself is responsive and very useful. I'll easily buy another. Just not from Acer, even if they have the fastest ones available."}

Mine is noticeably different, but still lightyears ahead of my old dinosaur laptop (which is really not that old, but in computer years, it's about a billion).\nPROS: Lightweight, quick start up, easy to use, battery lasts FOREVER, great sound quality\nCONS: Some weird compatibility issues with word files (formatting troubles generally, nothing too big), some very high-pitched ringing when running certain programs or pushing the limit. Speaking of pushing the limit, Chrome crashes on me when I have a lot of tabs open; this isn't a problem I have with my Toshiba Satellite (even though it's pretty old).\n\nWe considered getting one of these for my mom to use as her personal computer, as her work takes up most of her large laptop, but we just weren't convinced that she'd be able to make the switch. If you're considering buying for someone else, you should know that it is very different from a traditional Windows machine. For yourself, why are you even asking if it's a good idea? It's the best idea."}

Does not support most printers or scanners either.  Stupid things like you can't change the desktop picture, why I ask?  You also can't add one click buttons to the bottom tool bar such as FB or Pinterest. These are not supported by Chromebook.  I'd spend more money and get a Windows based laptop.  So far the only thing I have figured out how to do is surf the web.  I have had to google \"how to\" just to figure out how to use this Chromebook, and more often than not have been told that it is not supported.  Disappointed :("}

It's small, light and easy to use.\nWhat is weird is that I am a Mac person, don't use PC's much, but I found this little unit to be just about perfect for anything I need to do on the internet.  I bought it for that reason and it has lived up to my expectations.  It is not a computer and there are things I still need to use the bigger desktop computer, but that is rare these days.\nI realize there are thousands of reviews out there, but after months of using this little wonder, I decided it was time to let any curious person know that it is a quality tool for accessing the internet and very basic functions like word processing.\n\nMy only problem has been my tendency to touch the pad and accidently move the cursor to a place I didn't intend, but that is my shortcoming, not the Chromebook.  To date I have used this daily and there have been no problems at all.  I find the battery life to be great, about 10 hours on a full charge, and it charges back up quickly, unlike my tablet.  Now I use the tablet for reading books and the Chromebook for my internet and basic computer needs.\n\nI was fortunate enough to get mine very inexpensively on an Amazon special, but if I need anything like it again, I would pay upwards of 150 for it.

I had trouble syncing files larger than 200mb (some would sync some wouldn't, usually wouldn't) and when I tried to stop all syncing it wouldn't stick with that, and it really slowed it down. Then I couldn't use google drive at all, it wouldn't work what-so-ever, which is pretty inconvenient when your hard drive is only 16gb. Recently the touchpad started to become unresponsive, and the keys started to not work. Frankly I like google drive, in fact I use it on my android, but it only seems to work on my android (galaxy note II), but it doesn't seem to be of any use of this chromebook.

I also received the HP 14 Chromebook so between fixing students' laptops and mine, I am pretty familiar with them. If you only ever use a laptop to browse the internet, or you don't collaborate with others using Microsoft office products, and mostly do 1 or 2 things simultaneously, they are fine. They start up fast, weigh nothing, and since my students and I use Google Drive, the sharing of folders is seamless, but it would be the same on a fully stocked Windows or Mac computer.  I find I am sometimes making apologies for Chromebooks' ability level when speaking with students or parents. \"You want to write/edit a PDF? You can't use Foxfi like in Windows, but there are some really awful apps in the Chromestore.\" \"You want to print? Yes you can, but only if your home printer is Cloud-ready or there is a dedicated printer attached to a Classic Printer.\" I love Google Cloud Print, but some of my students and parents have a tough time setting it up.\n\nAs long as you are aware that you can't download software to this machine, like Skype, Word, Excel, Foxit, etc, you will like it. You can use Office through OneDrive, which is Microsoft's answer to Google Drive. If you can find Cloud/online/app versions of your favorite software, even better. Now that Microsoft has lowered the cost of it's licensing fees, and Intel is making a cheaper chip, there are some price competitive Windows laptops coming out. It will be interesting to see how/if Google reacts when price isn't a huge deciding factor for Chromebooks anymore. Google is coming out with some wonderful apps for education, and they maybe they will make those more integrated into the Chromebook experience."}

They put me through rebooting it, and through trial and error finally go the wifi to work, but the fatal flaw was in the fact that the trackpad didn't ever work right.  It would scroll so the cursor would move, but when you pressed it (as per the instructions) nothing happened.  I was able to tab around and activate a few things by pressing enter, but that's not nearly good enough from a device that was meant to replace a tablet that developed an unresponsive screen after over a year of use.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I use a heavy desktop replacement laptop to run engineering software and play games, but wanted something light that I could stick in my bag so that I could be productive on the go. I considered buying a tablet, but the lack of keyboard was a definite deal breaker and I didn't want to experiment with the pricey tablet / laptop hybrids.\n\nTo be honest, I bought the Acer C720 Chromebook because the $200 price tag was attractive enough to give Chrome OS a try. My expectations were not high, but after a month of usage I am here to say that this product is awesome! The Chromebook is very light, feels durable and awakens/sleeps (when you open/close the lid) almost instantaneously. Between working on documents, writing emails and watching videos, the battery lasts at least 6 hours on a single charge and doesn't seem to ever overheat or make fan noises. It's very quiet and cool.\n\nLately I've been using this just to marathon through my favorite TV shows and will make just one comment on actual performance speed. For the price of $200, it's understandable that the hardware won't be able to handle my bad habit of using \"open in new tab\" for each new video on my YouTube subscriptions list. Initially the load is slow and the flash plugin may even crash, but for all you normal people who open and watch one video at a time (and avoids having a 100 tabs), then this Chromebook will always run smoothly! The screen and picture quality is satisfactory, there are 2 USB ports available for my mouse (never liked using just the touch-pad), and there's an HDMI port to connect to my HDTV. I'm used to having DropBox take care of my cloud files, but duplicating it into Google Drive was simple and clean. Also glad that there is still hard-drive space for me to download school and work files to. I myself did not see the need to pay an additional $50 for the extra 16 GBs but that is more of a personal preference, as is the $100 extra for touch screen capability.\n\nConclusion: This product is great for casual use (videos, social media) or light work (email, google docs, blogging) and is even good enough to use as a main computer as long as you don't need specific software for work or play. With Black Friday around the corner, I'm planning to buy this again for my mother. Her only requirement is access to Facebook so that she can stalk me, but that's alright mom, I got you covered."}

I am not going to tell you he didn't look disappointed when he opened the box. I am not going to tell you he didn't call me the cheapest dad ever. But.. He was interested in what it could do. I showed him all the things he could do with Chrome and Google docs. He appeared to be mildly interested in it. So in an exuberent rush to keep the enthusiasm going I told him you can also load games on this. When he asked if it could run Minecraft I said sure, sure it can... Long story short this great little Chromebook not only can run Minecraft it can run Linux at the same time it is running chrome OS.\n\nThis Chromebook is made with quality plastic and the fit and finish are top notch. It performs well and with the addition of a USB stick you should not have an issue with storage. The screen quality is very good and you can also connect it to a larger monitor.\n\nI am not sure what plans Google has for Chrome OS in the future but this little laptop currently provides what my son needs for school and if you are adveturous you can expand this even further by loading Linux on it."}

I open it up from being suspended and by the time I've finished positioning the screen, it's ready for my password--no \"Windows is preparing your computer to suspend\" delays. By the time I've typed my password (which is easy because there's a real keyboard), it's re-connected to the right WiFi (assuming it's somewhere I've been before). Another blink, and I'm back looking at GMail in a browser window and that's already updated with new messages. And when I'm done, I just close it, and don't have to worry about playing Windows Hibernate Roulette. Nor do I have to worry about running out of battery--the 8-hour lifetime is real, holding up even after months of use--I simply haven't run out yet, partly because I can close it up and be confident of getting back exactly where I was in mere seconds.\n\nI use it for things like email, note-taking, simple spreadsheets, browsing, PDF viewing, Google Hangouts, delivering presentations, Youtube. It does all those things quickly and well. I wouldn't attempt big documents or software development or various other things I do with my office machine, but what it does, it does seamlessly.\n\nI wish it had PageUp/PageDown. I wish it had Delete. And I wish it had three real mouse buttons (especially since it's happy with those on an external mouse). And yes, you do need a WiFi network for most things (although you can take notes without one). But those are minor cavils about a complete modern computer that costs only $200."}

I have never owned a Chromebook before and spent quite a bit of time comparing different models (and being overwhelmed by the variety of options out there). I settled on this particular Chromebook because it really is an amazingly good deal. For $200 you might expect the quality to suffer, but I have been so impressed with how the C720 is built and performs. Yes, it's made of plastic. But the full-sized keyboard has a very solid feel. I type over 90 words per minute and I'm not getting any missing keystrokes at all. This is one of the most important aspects for me because I am a writer. The hinge is tight and solid-feeling, there is no flimsiness to the screen or awkward loosening of the hinge that I've noticed even in pricier electronics. The touch pad is highly responsive, zero complaints there. The Wi-Fi range is stunning. I can't get either of my tablets to hold a Wi-Fi signal in my bedroom. The C720 on the other hand keeps the signal and loads pages and games very quickly. The speakers are also surprisingly good for this price point. Watching Netflix movies and listening to music are fantastic experiences on the C720. The screen resolution is considered \"alright\" by today's standards, but the matte finish makes everything very crisp and readable. Colors are vibrant and washout is minimal. The screen is readable from multiple angles. The battery life is as good as advertised! I am always skeptical about claims regarding battery life, but I can and do get a solid 8 hours out of a full charge. The \"time left\" on a charge indicator is also accurate, thank goodness.\n\nIf you haven't owned a Chromebook before and this is your first time shopping for one, I promise you the C720 will not disappoint. It is jaw-dropping how much this little machine can do for just $200. That's cheap enough to use this as a trial run for a more expensive purchase. Or not. You might find you have everything you need in the C720. It's that great.\n\nIf you're on the fence, just go ahead and buy it. You'll be happy you did.\n\nUpdate 1/14/2016: I still use this Chromebook on a daily basis and it's running as well as it did when I bought it. It just keeps trucking along. I spent over $1,000 on laptops that didn't last this long. Truly the best computer purchase I've ever made!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "Chromebooks are they way to go!! I bought this over the summer to get a feel for the product.  The school I teach at was about to roll out Chromebooks to all the students. I wanted to be prepared.  I really love them.  If you don't know much about Chromebooks and think they are just like any other laptop..they are NOT.  Things cannot be downloaded onto them thus NO viruses. You may think I want to download stuff. Well, they are apps and extensions in the Chromestore (most that are free).  This product is so easy to use!! My 9 year is starting use them in her school also. She has not problem navigating and trouble shooting.  Google products are top notch.  The product updates itself and really can do whatever you need it to! So light and pretty durable!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I needed to order two of these. The first one was dead on arrival but Amazon was kind enough to provide a free return label so i sent it back, it arrived at the local warehouse in a day, i received my refund then i ordered another one although i was hesitant at first but the 2,000 reviews and the initial impression i had with the build quality and style of the device convinced me to give it another chance. I received a working model two days later and i have been in love ever since. I only need my windows desktop for virtual machines and the adobe suite. I can get by without MS Office and i'm a heavy user of Google products/services so it was a natural transition for me in terms of the app selection, marketplace and browsing environment.\n\nAs for a computing device, this little machine is a beast. I have never used a computer in recent years that didn't require 4-8GB of ram and a quad core cpu to deliver a smooth, high performance experience. The chrome browser in this system is equivalent to the experience i receive on my custom build desktop with 4GB of ram, an 8 core 4ghz amd cpu and ssd. I haven't tried resource intensive websites but it has handled everything i've thrown at it over the past two days of use without issue. I multitask a lot and always have an abundance of tabs open at one time. It hasn't been a problem, even while watching a 1080p video on YouTube. Granted the resolution is low at 1360x768 so it may slow down when i plug it into a 1080p display but it's still a surprise considering netbooks in 2010 were terrible at rendering 720p videos.\n\n Using google docs and being in the cloud is an awesome workflow. One of the reasons behind my decision to order this Chromebook was to have a good reason to use cloud services. On windows everything is stored locally so if you still haven't adopted to cloud storage or g docs; you won't be able to easily access your files across all of the different devices in your home unless you use Dropbox, Box or OneDrive. With G Drive built into the machine, i installed the app to my two desktops and phone to transfer some important files to the Chromebook and it has helped me immensely. I no longer need to worry about my ability to locate and retrieve what i need when i need it which gives me peace of mind along with the fact that i don't need to worry about optimization issues, driver conflicts, viruses, misconfigured bios settings, incompatible hardware or anything else that comes with traditional windows machines.\n\nThat leads me to another factor in my decision making process. I needed something that would allow me to maintain my online business without distractions. Managing the IT that you use to make money can really cut into productivity and efficiency which becomes incredibly frustrating when you're a one man show. It takes time away from time more important things that need to be completed. I've been using Windows from Win '95 to 8.1 Update 1 and have spent countless hours diagnosing and resolving unexpected technical issues. A mac is out of the question for me, so i'm very grateful for an alternative to be be in the form of a Chromebook. Cheap, fast, light, portable, and with a battery that last from morning till night during constant use. It only takes an hour and half to charge. This thing is incredible.\n\nIf your workflow will allow it or if your just curious; i highly recommend you order one of these and give them a try."}

For a second computer or one to bring to class, this thing is actually perfect since the browser is all you need for those types of things. The drawback is that you probably can't install any software or programs that you may need to complete specifics tasks. Having said that, it has met all of my expectations and all of its advertised features (the battery life is excellent!). The track pad is great, the battery does actually last as long as advertised, and it has yet to freeze or be slower than I need it to be. It would be five stars if my keyboard was working properly.\n\nMy particular laptop has a defective Enter key. The button is difficult to press down hard enough for the computer to receive the input.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I purchased this computer after reading the various reviews of it.  For the most part, I am pleased.  However, there are some things about it that annoy me.  One is that I do not like the touchpad operates.  I must twist my hand so that there is an even pressure when I press down, and the procedure often does not work.  For example, if I try to copy text, if I don't press down in the right way or on the right spot, I the marking of the text disappears and I have to start all over again.  It is so much easier to use two buttons for this purpose and use the touch pad for what it was meant to do.  Also, while I am active on a site in Google, suddenly gmail or YouTube or Google docs will become activated and I will have to shut it down.  Finally, I find that the memory does not process commands and information in a really stable way.  I will have typed some text and suddenly it will disappear, and I will have to start all over again, or my cursor will be at one spot on a page and suddenly it will jump to another location.  Sometimes, I don't notice it and will continue typing at the new location.  I am not a computer technician, so I cannot specify exactly why this happens.  I just guess that it has something to do with memory processing.  I have not had this problem with my other laptops.  Finally, menus often pop up on the scree when I tap at a location to insert text.\n\nOn the positive side, I am pleased with the Chromebook's size, light weight, pleasant screen display and very quick access to the internet.  The keyboard is quite nice but I still wish there were a delete key instead of using Alt-Backspace."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "First off, I'm not one who usually writes reviews... With that said I really like my Acer C720 Chromebook! It's a solid purchase for someone who went from a Macbook, to a PC, and then to the Chromebook. From what I see, most people do everything on the internet i.e. Facebook, Netflix, and Youtube. Most people don't need a machine that can animate the universe in a crystal clear 3D rendering, so why spend more than a thousand bucks to only use the internet?\nThe machine itself has a solid construction. It's easy to setup and use. It's lightning fast on the internet and I'm continually impressed with it. Of my laptops this one is generally my preference.\n\nThe one Drawback is that ChromeOs is not good for any. other. program. period.\n\nI bought this computer that I could download MT4 for daytrading when I couldn't be at home; and while there is a way to do it on this machine, it involves poking around in Developer Mode and potentially ruining a perfectly good computer. It does have a built in remote access feature which remedies this problem by allowing you to access your home PC from anywhere yet as I did not have a home PC, this feature was useless to me.\n\nMy solution was to purchase the Acer Aspire E 11, a windows based computer which is the Chromebook's major competition. In comparison, the Aspire has a flimsier construction and everything I do on it has a little lag. But, using the two together gives my a multiple monitor, mobile trading station for under $500.\n\nThe takeaway: this is a great machine if you have a home PC to remote access. Otherwise it is solely a box of internet."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I purchased one of these recently, and overall I've been quite pleased. It does almost everything I need a laptop to do, it's compact, has a nice keyboard, and has a battery life so long that I've yet to encounter a situation where I've had to discontinue use due to lack of power. When considering purchasing one of these, you need to be aware of what it is and what it isn't. It is not a Windows computer, it will not run Windows programs or executables of any kind. You can not download anything intended for a Windows machine and expect it to work. Call that point one. It is not a Linux or Android machine. You cannot install apps from the Market, HOWEVER, there are a lot of Android apps that have been ported to ChromeOS, and more are being done every day. If you are a Linux hacker, you probably won't like the Chromebook, there is no shell by default, and a lot of the functionality that a Linux user would expect is hidden or absent. Call that point two. So what is this thing? Well, pretty much what the descriptions all say, a heavily network dependent netbook that eliminates most of the fluff in favor of a simple browser-based environment. Is this a bad thing? No, if you are primarily looking for a web browsing and e-mail machine (90% of what I use a laptop for, admittedly) that can handle some basic document-based tasks. The upside: it can do almost everything a high-end Android tablet can do for less money and (for me) greater convenience. It's mostly idiot-proof. It's largely free from any security concerns. It's fast, simple, and there are no licensing issues. The downside: What it can't do...connect to Windows workgroups or domains easily (use Cloud for this), print easily (Cloud again), navigate (no GPS enabled), not very upgradeable (RAM is not upgradeable on this model, however larger SSDs can be installed if you are technically competent and follow the procedure correctly, (it is not trivial).\n\nIn short, I give it 4 stars for doing what it was designed to well. If it had a GPS capability (most tablets have this), I'd give it 5. Overall, I'm satisfied with it for the price I paid, and it's the first new laptop/netbook I've bought in a while. I was originally considering installing Linux, but the Chrome OS works so well for what I use this for, that I don't really see the point. If people paid more careful attention to what they need when they're considering buying a Chromebook, there would be less complaints. It will not replace a full-featured Windows or Mac laptop for every role that they might fill, but for a lot of people, it would be close enough."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I'll begin by stating I'm a longtime Windows fanboy.  My only step out of the faith is I've been also using an Apple Touch for several years which I like.  I finally bought this Acer Chromebook (2GB variety) and I'm hooked.  It's truly secure, simplistic, and speedy.  I never expected that once I began using a CB I wouldn't call on my trusty Win 7 Acer laptop.  But that is what has happened.  This morning I cranked up my Win machine to print from my CB and had all types of problems.  This brought flashbacks of all the issues I've had with Windows over a 20 year span (BSOD etc.)  Of course no relationship is perfect.  One aspect I've had problems with this Chromebook is file management.  I miss the Windows Explorer Cut/Copy/Paste and all the tricks.  Another is that some of my \"Win legacy\" devices (wireless mouse, porting to an external ASUS monitor) are flighty at times.  Finally, printing to my old HP 1200 Laser through the Google Cloud hasn't always been user friendly.  But the bottom line is: I may never go back to my old flame.\nOh, one tip.  There are two USB ports: the USB 3.0 is on the left, the USB 2.0 on the right.  At first I attempted to use the 3.0 port and inserted a thumbdrive to upload some of my files.  Not recognized.  I then moved the thumbdrive to the right hand side and everything's working.  This probably is due to the age of my USB-connected devices (3-8 years old)."}

It has a battery life of about 3-4 days with occasional use during those days. It boots up super quickly, even if I do put it to sleep or turn it off. It's sooooo light it's fantastic. This was the main feature I wanted because, as a college student, I tend to want to bring laptops to class or club meetings or to the library when I'm studying, but I also have to carry books and notebooks and binders. When all of this stuff is in my backpack, it causes a lot of stress on my back, but the Chromebook has greatly reduced that stress and I literally don't even feel like I'm carrying it. The speakers work well (there might be a little problem with the headphone jack but barely noticeable). One slight pet peeve is that there's no caps lock, but that's generally not a big deal."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I was very happy with the Chromebook operating system. I used this for general browsing. In the past, I had another competitor netbook (not to be named!) for 3 years for the same general purpose, and had a great experience- I was looking forward to having the Chromebook.\n\nUnfortunately, I chose to ignore reviews across a variety of sites that warned of flimsy lcd screens, that easily broke. I'm a single, 30 year old woman, who has never sent a product in for a warranty repair. I'd say I'm a dream consumer- I don't have problems with electronics, and I have light wear and tear use. However, upon opening my Chromebook that I had owned for 2 months, the screen was distorted, and I was to learn that this was my fault- the warranty will not cover cracked screens. The screen never fell, was only used by myself, not brought on a trip... was at my home, and I would easily categorize the use as light. I'm very disappointed that the screen would not be able to tolerate light use, and I find this unacceptable for a product. The repair facility would decrease screen repairs to $75, but it didn't feel worth it to keep this chromebook with this overall issue. I should have listened to other warnings by reviewers, and yet, I felt like my light use would not cause a problem for myself, and so I wanted to share my experience- with light, non-frequent use in the optimal environment (I don't even have a cat!) caused issues that I felt were unacceptable (even at this low price, use of less than 2 months is not worth the price). I would very much suggest looking for a chromebook with a better made lcd screen."}

Students, please, if you're considering a Macbook or a higher-end laptop for writing your documents, making excel files, creating powerpoint presentations, browsing the internet, or any other low-CPU intensive tasks (including some web-based games and video viewing), and you are willing to accept a form of cloud storage as your back-up, then give a chromebook a second chance, especially if you need to save money.\n\nPROS:\n\n-Very, very fast boot up time, be online in seconds due to the minimal OS and SSD.\n-The Intel Celeron processor is actually very impressive in running tasks, and much more capable of multitasking than the old netbooks from several years ago.  Web browse, write a document, and watch a video on youtube at the same time with ease.\n-Lower chances of being infected by a virus with a new, minimal OS with virus protection built in.  However, always know, NO computer is 100% safe from viruses.  Be a smart internet surfer, and be careful of the Apps you install.\n-Seamlessly work with Google's program ecosystem, equivalent  of Microsoft Office are available as Google Docs.  Similar Apps are available on Google Play, with new and rising applications released all the time.\n-Matte screen means less glare when working outside.  Screen brightness is adequate for outdoor use.\n-Considerable battery life, about 6 hours with steady use. 8.5 Hours seems to be the maximum with limited use (using one program, or just web browsing with minimal brightness)\n-Chrome OS is easy to learn, easy to use for all ages.\n\nCONS:\n-Limited Hard Drive storage.  You are relining on internet-based storage, and should have a backup of your work with you.  Consider an external drive.\n-Keyboard feels unsatisfying to use, it isn't the worst, but lacks quality and feels cheap.\n-A new ecosystem of applications that take time to get used to, but most of the basic applications, such as Google Docs, are straightforward and handy to use.\n-Not upgrade-able.\n-Not usable for graphic design, gaming, or intensive 4K video viewing (but really, did you expect it to be capable of these things?)"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "The C720 is a device that lets me do everything I need for work and play. I am an IT administrator and I was looking for a device that is portable enough for me to move back and forth between multiple locations. At first I considered a tablet, but without a physical keyboard, it is very difficult to type fast and be productive. Let's face it, typing with your thumbs or using one finger at a time is not ideal. All of the servers I setup at my place of employment can be administered through a web browser. I tried using the web browser on a smartphone and tablet, but the experience was horrible. Even with \"Desktop Site\" enabled, the scaling was just off and was difficult to navigate. The advantage of a chromebook is that you will always have the desktop version of a website instead of a mobile version. I can also remotely control my own computers or my co-workers computers if they need me to troubleshoot something for them.\n\nI am also a graduate student and the chromebook fulfills all of my needs for school. The chromebook will not be perfect for all students. Since I am a business student, I do not use specialized software that is only found on Windows or Mac. Using Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides have replaced Microsoft Office for me. If you try using the android or IOS apps for Docs, Sheets, and Slide, you will most likely have very crippled office applications. However, since you are getting full websites on a chromebook, the transition from Microsoft Office to Google Docs was seamless. Because my professors always request APA format for my papers, I am very happy that I can still format my papers correctly on the chromebook.\n\nIt is great that Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, and CrunchyRoll work well on the C720. If you install an ad blocker onto the C720, almost all ads from YouTube and Hulu are blocked. Because of this feature, I find myself watching more video content from the C720 instead of my phablet or tablet.\n\nI have heard some people say that chromebooks are bricks without the internet. I would like to say that this is not true. Without internet connection, I can still access my documents from Drive. I can even edit my documents offline as well. The second my chromebook has internet access again, all of the changes I made in Google Drive or Google Docs are synced. I was also able to play movies and music that are stored on an SD card. Even without an internet connection, it is possible to still be productive. I will admit that you can't do everything on a chromebook without internet connection. When you think about it, what will you use your Windows or Mac PC for if you do not have an internet connection? I remember when my home internet connection was down for maintenance, my wife never touched her Windows PC or tablet. When the internet connection was up and running again, she was using her devices again.\n\nBecause of how chromebooks are setup, you are getting a very personalized device. When you sign-in to your chromebook, you see your bookmarks, apps, and search history. If you are a fan of Google Now, you will also see the same notifications on the chromebook.\n\nSo far, I have commented a lot about the positive side of the C720. Now it is time to talk about some things that I think can be improved. The screen is a common issue that people have with the C720. For the price, it is acceptable, but you are not getting a screen that is ideal for photo editing. There are some great photo editing apps for chromebooks, but because of the quality of the screen, your adjustments to the brightness and contrast of a picture will be off. How you adjust pictures on the C720 may look good, but when you look at the picture on another device, it may look slightly different. The lack of an ethernet port is also an issue that I have. It is great that this is a wifi device. The problem is that many public wifi spots such as your local library or coffee shop may have poor quality wifi access points. In these cases, an ethernet connection will be much more reliable. That is about it for the cons that I have with the C720.\n\nRemember that when you are purchasing the C720 or any chromebook, understand that the operating system is different. I notice that many people get this and think it is a cheap laptop with Windows and are disappointed. Before buying a chromebook, you can test out its functionality by downloading the Chrome web browser on your current computer. Checkout the Chrome app store and start testing out different applications. Anything you can do in the Chrome web browser, you can do in a Chromebook.\n\nEven though the C720 has its cons, I am still happy with my purchase overall. Because of the C720, I feel more productive whether I am at my desk or offsite. I thought that phablets will help me get more work done because of the larger screen. I now believe that the C720 allows me to do more work than my Note 3."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "It's hard for me to describe the appeal of a Chromebook to those who have never used it. First thing I ask to prospective buyers, have you ever used the Chrome browser before? If yes, it's a little easier to describe and even so very difficult and if no, then it's damn near impossible. Chrome, as a browser, is pretty much the ultimate tool for navigating the internet. Google has reigned supreme over search engines since launching and has remained the cream of the crop, and while there have been competitors over the years and people have questioned many of their changes they have kept prevalent for a reason. Same thing applies to their browser, it's fast, efficient, easy to use, and has constantly endured a number of changes with the user in mind.\n\nChrome OS is the Chrome browser on steroids and nothing more. This might be disappointing to some who are used to the traditional environment of a computer, but rest assured that most if not all of your needs will be satisfied by this device. You can create documents, you can edit photos and video, there are IDEs for programming, remote desktop functions, chat features, and a whole lot more. Sure, a lot of these features are not going to be as in-depth as their Windows or Mac counterparts but these computers weren't built for everything. Chromebooks are built to satisfy the needs of most computer users and other users still have other options if they need it. But if you're looking for a cheap and effective computing device, then look no further.\n\nThe downsides are that most people need to get used to cloud computing and that almost nothing on the device can be stored natively unless you use an external hard drive, flash drive, or SD card, and to be quite honest that can be a pain. And like I said, they have their limits on certain functions such as the media editing and gaming. Additionally some people are turned off by the fact that you're also locked into Google's own software, which while very good, isn't as widely used. For example, there is no Skype so you'll have to turn some buddies onto using Google Hangouts as a substitute.\n\nMoving on, the Acer C720 is a great device with a nice and sturdy build. The matte screen isn't overly reflective and has a decently nice display that can get plenty bright and the colors and resolution are perfectly adequate. Unfortunately, the keyboard and trackpad while also of solid build are loud and clacky while in use which can be pretty obnoxious. The fan is dead silent and the laptop itself never gets too hot and only gets mildly warm while performing a lot of functions at once. All in all, it's built well and works fantastic with the operating system."}

My kids use the Chromebook daily for school work so I needed a way to monitor/control sites visited to control how time was spent on the device. For this purpose the Chromebook is excellent.\n\nWithout physically standing over my kids it has just been impossible to ensure that they are doing homework instead of visiting other sites.  Using the Chrome dashboard I'm able to view what they are doing online from my own laptop or smartphone. If they're supposed to be doing homework only but have other tabs open, I can click on the site in my dashboard and block sites I feel are not part of their homework process. They can in turn send me a request to unlock certain sites which gives me the option to \"allow\" or \"deny\" access. The chromebook is perfect for those parents who want to know what sites their kids are visiting and whether or not they are really just doing homework."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "My macbook is slowly dying away and I needed a laptop that I can carry around campus and at my job. My friends were reluctant about chromebooks and told me to shy away, due to lack of many functions. I did my research and I realized that I mainly use my macbook for browsing the web and writing papers anyway. I had bad experiences with acer, before. Partly because Acer computers were so slow. Wow. This machine blew my mind. I love the minimalistic features. I tend to shy away from Windows, due to the fact that there are so many unnecessary apps. There were no unnecessary apps that cluttered the interface or even the hard drive. I use google drive to store most of my files anyway. This is so compact and slick. I was hesitant about the C720 model because I felt as though there were better chromebook options. One of the most compelling reason I got C720 was due to its price. Now I feel like I made the right choice. It does what it intends. I carry it around to work on my lesson plans and school works. I only wish I got this sooner. My other choice was to buy a cheap PC and get Ubuntu instead.\n\nChromebook is the ultimate work computer. It allows me to stay on task, because I'm not distracted by gaming."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "Original Post on 10/10/14:\n\nI just purchased this at a BestBuy store a few days back. I have been out of town on business and left my iPad at home, so I decided to see what cheap options they had for my personal use in lieu of the MIA iPad. Low and behold, I found this model as the former display model being sold with the open box specials for $98. I have to admit, I figured that it wouldn't be worth it, and I couldn't get any answers out of the staff at Bestbuy about the hardware, and sadly my smartphone was dead. I left and didn't buy it. Once I got back to the hotel I researched the hardware for this little machine and decided to go back the next day and grab it....and boy am I glad I did. I think this has been the best bargain of anything I have purchased in this category, ever! I am actually typing on this machine right now on a flight using in-flight wifi.\n\nThe computer is pretty slick for what you get, I have to laugh because it has way more computing power than my first computers in the early 90's. I also was only interested in picking up one of these with Intel hardware, which ruled out the Samsung models (this is because I wanted something to dual boot linux with). Great machine for the money, very light weight, very snappy, amazing battery life, and even the screen impresses me for the price I paid.\n\nNow onto the OS. Chrome really is not that bad, probably decent for most of your web browsing / casual internet needs. I don't care for the way they have incorporated office documents, which requires an internet connection. This thing boots up really fast too.\n\nExtra bonus: I successfully installed Ubuntu Linux to dual boot on this machine. In most cases I will probably be using Ubuntu, but Chrome deff has its place. Right now I am using chrome since I just want to use the web browser, and that is actually snappier. The Ubuntu OS actually runs way better than I expected on this machine also, which is to say pretty darn quick too. With my install / experience, everything was seamless too.\n\nOverall I can't believe how much you get for your $98. I am just ecstatic. I am definitely done with the iPad 3 that I have at home. This is way more versatile, and doesn't lock you into all the Apple nonsense. I really can't list any serious cons. If the price tag were higher I might say well its too bad that the chasis is all plastic, or that the screen isn't a little nicer....but even though it is plastic it is built very well. Even at the $199 list price this machine is a steal, especially once you factor in the fact that the hardware is linux supported.\n\nUpdate on 10/16/14:\n\nAfter using the machine for about a week, I am still glad I made the purchase, I still believe that this little machine is an amazing bargain. Although, my attitude towards Chrome OS has definitely changed a bit. I decided that Chrome is not worth wasting disk space on to have as a dual boot option. Also, the ChruBuntu dual boot script install has a flaw, that being WiFi seems to only want to work for whatever connection used to download / install it. I have now gone the other route of flashing the firmware and making legacy and USB boot and seabios the default, and have only Ubuntu installed. There were only a couple things that didn't work out of the box, and the fixes are well documented. Instead of installing all the fixes, I reinstalled \"HugeGreenBug's Ubuntu 14.0.4 64bit for Acer C720 - Version 1.0.3\" which can be found here: https://www.distroshare.com/distros/get/12/#comment-1634877963\n\nHUGE TIME SAVER, WAY EASY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.\n\nThe install methods for both the dual boot and more 'permanent' install option are below:\nhttp://www.linux.com/learn/tutorials/764181-how-to-install-linux-on-an-acer-c720-chromebook\nhttp://www.circuidipity.com/c720-sidbook.html (I recommend the version from distroshare.com referenced earlier than regular ubuntu, same install procedure though)\n\nOverall the only thing I can add to my complaints is the lack of a delete key on the keyboard, as well as the function keys being in lieu of the F keys. That is still a minor complaint at this price point. If I were to buy one of the flashier versions of this computer, you start getting into the price point $350+ that you will find lots of other options with better hardware. Best $98 I have ever spent on computer stuff."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "Let me just say that I've had this baby only a day, and it has surpassed my initial fears!\n\nI ended up getting this because my main laptop is in the shop (new screen needed), and I needed to have something cheap, but sturdy and workable as a backup.  This baby did NOT disappoint one bit!\n\nPlease keep in mind that this is NOT what one would consider a laptop in terms of working with productivity-type of programs (Microsoft Office), or heavy gaming-- but is basically meant for surfing the net, watching netflix and movies-- which quite frankly, is what I do with my laptop 98% of the time...  Now for the pros & cons:\n\nPROS\nIs Superfast - It boots up immediately\nIs Lightweight, but not cheesy...\nDoes not get \"hot\" or overheated\nSilent fan.  Cannot hear it at all\nCannot beat the cost at $200\nIf you're already on Google Chrome-  nothing you have to do but to log in...\nBattery Life is Superb!  I'm already at the 7 hour mark, and still have half battery power left\n\nCONS\nIf you are not already signed up with Google Chrome (I wasn't until I got this), you may have a problem in having this computer sync to the internet.  I'm gonna be honest--  at first, when I opened up this computer and tried to log into it by signing up for Google Chrome--  it kept saying I couldn't get an internet connection--  when it was clear I could as all the bars were lit up...  and everything else in my home on wifi was just fine...  I ended up going to my Kindle Fire and signed up for Google Chrome and voila!  When I went back to this computer to sign in, no problemo!  I strongly suggest that if you are not signed up with Google Chrome when you purchase this computer, that you do so prior to receiving it, IJS...\n\nNo printer hookup is a problem...  but apparently you can do so from the \"Cloud\", with a printer that has bluetooth...  Haven't tried it yet so I don't know how efficient that is.\n\nNo backlit keyboard.  If I'm up late at night, and in my bed using this, I want to be able to use it without lights on, IJS...\n\nNo delete or CAPS Lock Keys - These are the two things about this computer that I miss the most, but not a biggie, just an inconvenience.\n\n10/14/14 UPDATE - Discovered that you can substitute the \"search\" key for the CAPS LOCK key. All you have to do is to click your profile photo on the bottom right of the screen and select \"settings\".  When the \"settings\" page appears, go to the \"Device\" section, and click on the \"Keyboard Settings\" button.  When the \"Keyboard Settings\" box appears, pull down the search list and select \"CAPS LOCK\".  Click the ok button and you're done!\n\nSo far, so good!  I'm even considering getting one for my daughter for Xmas...  Also, this would make a great starter computer for young children who don't need an expensive laptop or ipad...  And for senior citizens who just basically surf the net and watch movies and listen to music like my mom...\n\nOne of the best purchases I've made in a long while..."}

This three pound laptop can do just about everything a traditional computer does, just in some new ways. The one thing they cannot do is print directly from a connection. And of course I don't think people play WOW on them. Nevertheless, the performance of this laptop is superb and just feels high quality even while I'm typing this now. Files are saved to the cloud, which can be accessed easily from anywhere. The fact that they are resistant against just about all computer viruses makes me very happy.\nA lot of people were complaining about Acer's design in some of the reviews. Quite frankly I think that is wrong. I love the keyboard more than any keyboard I've used. I love the off white color they used on this particular model. The feel of the plastic feels a bit cheap at first but when you start using it you will start to see how solid it is. I am not a very smart person when it comes to new technology and computers. This machine points people like me in the right direction. The help tutorials and great apps are amazing for me when I'm stumped with something. It just keeps getting better. I am a web surfer. I like Netflix and youtube and spend most my time on the internet, which is what this computer is for. Having one of the fastest internet connected laptops is a very nice thing.\nPros:\nVERY fast internet connection and speed overall with start up\nAffordable and simplistic (not cheap!)\nI love the keyboard and design\nCons:\nCant hook a printer up to it\nDoesn't have a hard drive to install computer games (not a gaming laptop) buy a playstation 4!\nI also herd something about Itunes not being on it...However I also was reading today that you can use something called ubuntu to install linyx and then use itunes. However, I'm not that worried all that since I have a desktop to do that on."}

We needed about 400 chromebooks for our district, and chose the Acer over the Samsung because we felt this one seemed sturdier (while the Samsung XE303 seemed a little flimsy). While that is true, the quality control seems to be terrible. After about a month of use, we have sent at least 15 almost-new chromebooks in for repair already. We ordered a large batch of Samsungs last year and only had 1 or 2 that were defective. Issues with the Acers center mostly on the screen backlight, with several other issues as well.\n\nIn addition, we have found that Acer's customer support is frustrating to deal with as well (which seems to be located overseas!) They rarely offer to pay the shipping for the defective chromebook repair, and are just a pain to deal with in general. In contrast, Samsung has excellent customer service with clear-speaking representatives and will pay the shipping both ways without question.\n\nIn summary, while the Acers seem sturdier, the Samsungs seem to be more reliable overall, and have much better warranty support."}

The 11.6\" screen is great for them as they like to sit close to screens anyway so I don't need to worry about a large screen in front of their face, plus it's nice and small for them to carry around.\n\nIt's very lightweight and feels as though it's made fairly well, I don't feel as though it's made as well as some other Chromebooks we've looked at, but it's what I expected with purchasing a lower cost device.\n\nWe've hooked it up to our TV via an HDMI cable and were pleasantly surprised that not only can we mirror the Chromebook's screen, but we can extend the display as well, giving us two screens. This would come in handy if they wanted to watch a video and do some web-browsing/homework on the chromebook at the same time. I'm sure this is a feature found on all Chromebooks but thought it was worth mentioning.\n\nThe battery life is good, which comes in handy when you have kids that don't always remember to plug it in to charge or we can plug it in to the TV for several movies before having to worry about the battery dying.\n\nControl (This is for all Chromebooks, not just Acer) - as mentioned above, my wife and I wanted control over what our sons did and with the Chromebooks, we were able to set up supervised accounts with myself as the main account. This allowed me to turn mature content results off so that mature content wouldn't accidentally pop up when searching for school articles or going through Google Images (you'd be surprised how easy it is to find things you weren't even looking for). They can still go to a website if they type in the URL but it won't show up in Google's search results, or it at least has a lesser chance of showing up. In addition to filtering search results, it will let me view their web history with no option for them to delete it or browse in In Cognito mode.\n\nThey are able to use a mouse with it, the screen is good, it's made decently, and has plenty of power for our purposes. All in all, it's a great Chromebook that I would recommend, especially for the low cost."}

It does just that, and perfectly.\n\nThe boot speed is awesome. It takes just a couple of seconds from pressing the power button to being on Reddit.\n\nI almost didn't buy because people complained about the screen quality. Goes to show some people just like to complain. The screen is prefect.\n\nCons: none.\n\nThings to know: this laptop is basically as functional as a smartphone. Just imagine a smartphone that is designed as a laptop and a lot faster, and you have the Chromebook."}

This chromebook is perfect for what I need it for.  First advantage being the price of course, you can't go wrong with $200.  Very portable, which is exactly what I need with all of the heavy books/binders/etc. that I need to carry around.  Free built-in security, very fast boot up, 8.5 hours battery life and no need to pay for Microsoft products such as Word, Excel, etc.  Of course there are other things that I can't do with this chromebook such as download certain apps like Skype, however, there are other alternatives that come with the chromebook.  Overall, judging based on using it for school, I would recommend it to a friend and would buy again if I had to!"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I purchased Acer C720 Chromebook (11.6-Inch, 2GB) Not from Amazon) for my techno challenged husband. I first tried buying him the original Kindle fire, thinking that he might have an easier time working with a touch screen. No. Just no. So I gave him some time, and when he refused to even pick up the kindle, I took it back, put it in my name and now I have a Fire. Since I really do NOT want to always be looking up things online for him, his union work and his random sprots questions etcetera, I thought I would have a go at an Acer Chromebook for him. While he is still not setting the internet on fire, he is able to peck his way around. The small size suits him, fits in his briefcase for union business and he finds it less intimidating than a tablet for some reason. The size of the screen and keyboard is fine for him, even though his hands are bigger than mine. I have also suggested this item for some computer challenged folks who come to the library looking for help using the internet. IT is more than enough for a little internet browsing and e-mail, and that's all they need.\n\nThat's really all I need! Or at least that is what I'm trying to convince myself, when I want to go and buy a pricey macbook."}

It starts of REAL FAST. I'm not joking. The fastest startup device I've used so far! It claims to boot up in 7 seconds but it boots up almost instantaneously.\n\nI've read a review which says to buy a wireless mouse with it and I'm glad that I bought it. The mousepad is sensitive, and i can't really get used to it. There's no delete and caps button, but you can just use shift to TYPE CAPS. YES I'm using my Chromebook right now.\n\nThe only thing I was disappointed is the lack of ability to play certain audio files. I am intending to install linux on it and hopefully I can install VLC and other stuff. Other than these problems this little device works really well. Take your time to read some of the negative reviews before buying, and do your research about what a chromebook is. I am glad I purchased this.

You can now select if you want sound to come over the TV or the chromebook's internal speakers, and the default is over TV if it's connected.\n\nOriginal review:\nTake it from a professional software developer who doesn't get excited by every little piece of tech news. This is a great device built to let you get online and get things done quickly. It's perfect for browsing, email, ordering stuff online, checking bank balances, watching YouTube, etc. It does have some storage if you want to download pdf files and such. It also has an SD card slot if you want to transfer photos from you digital camera to Dropbox. Just don't expect to install and run any kind of offline program. Go with Windows/Mac for that.\n\nOther things to like:\nThe build quality is great for the price.\nThe screen looks better than the mid-priced HP windows laptop I bought in 2011.\nThe keyboard is very comfortable.\n\nI couldn't get sound to come over HDMI to my TV. Not sure if it's a hardware or software problem. Despite that, the laptop's great to get things done and move on."}

It's limited enough so she can't get lost, or install a lot of junk, but powerful enough to do all the things she needs (browsing, email, dictionary, youtube, and play music).  The one thing I wish it did which it currently lacks was decode AC3 audio (my mkv's are mostly AC3), but she doesn't watch my .mkv's so she doesn't notice.  The screen quality isn't as nice as her previous laptop, and I'm willing to spend more for that feature - but at $180 I understand.  Battery life is terrific - more than 8 hours for her."}

I guess this will be my main laptop for more than 5 years if it don't break! :)\nUpdate: 4 years later still works like a charm! it's by far the most useful, easiest to use laptop I've ever had! I am getting out of college now but I still see I'll carry it around for work emails and browsing the internet. it's just handy! Also still getting newest update and still nothing broke. If you think I had a laptop case for it and protected it then well... nope, I don't even have a backpack for it, I just put it in my purse with other things (I know I'm horrible), yet it still works SO GOOD!

For the rest,  I love how fast it turns on  and how fast it allows me to browse the internet.  I would recommend this  Chromebook only for the smaller size...11.6 inch......Great to travel with. since it is very light and more reliable than say your average Tablet,  unless of course you plan to use the Tablet mostly for ereading and or taking pictures to send on to FB or other media markets.  It plays Netflix and most media programs like C-Span, all all the other TV channels.  UNLESS....it is a program that requires SILVERLIGHT......then I am sorry you are out of luck.

Due to the newest mandated state tests, we decided to get a computer like what they will test on at school. I and they were so excited to open the computer. However, it is entirely useless, as the internet adapter will not maintain a connection to my wireless network for the internet. None of the 4 other computers in my home-office network have any trouble maintaining a connection, but this Acer cannot and will not maintain a connection.\n\nJust to get it to connect the first day, I had to disable security on my network. Then it connected. So, being that I will not leave my 30mbps x 10 mbps connection in the suburbs open for the world to use, I reactivated the security to exactly the same settings. Like magic, the acer reconnected when I entered the same SSID and password that failed before.\n\nAll was well, until the next day. Once again, it will not connect to the wireless network. This time, I changed a setting on the wireless router to enable MAC filtering. Like magic, I then entered the same SSID and password again, and it worked. Again, all was well until one kid logged off and another logged on.\n\nThis now has the computer once again unable to connect to the network. It does not make sense for me to have to reconfigure my router each time one of my multiple children log onto the computer. Piece of crap, and hopefully Amazon will process the return quickly.\n\nAmazon processed my return with no problems. For anyone considering this purchase, read this first. http://community.acer.com/t5/Chromebook/C720-Chromebook-wifi-connection-drops/td-p/147129/page/8. It is clear there is a problem with this machine connecting to some wireless networks (mine clearly) and Acer has no idea how to fix. But it makes no sense for me to rebuild and reconfigure my home (also office) network that works for 4 computers and multiple other devices just for a $200 toy. Lessons to me - do research and buy from amazon due to excellent return policy."}

Here are the basics, from a Chromebook novice.\n\nPros: compact, light, and simple to use for mom -- who's easily intimidated by computers -- for light internet, email, and Facebook. Her laptop had serious overheating issues, and the C720 has stellar performance in that area; mom rests it on her bed and it nonetheless runs cool and quiet (but it's still inadvisable to rest it on a soft surface, and mom's experience might not prove universal when doing so!). Cooling was one of my primary concerns in selecting her replacement computer, and I thought I was making a concession there by choosing the C720 over one of the pricier models with a fanless processor, but not so!\n\nCons: the proprietary Google Chrome operating system (standard on any Chromebook, not just the C720) means a few software concessions. So far that means no Skype (only the Google-branded alternative, Google Hangouts), and an apparent inability to load at least some Facebook apps -- targeted research turned up this problem after mom was unable to load the Facebook game \"Doctor Who: Legacy,\" so interested parties would be wise to look into potential compatibility issues with any Facebook apps they expect to use. And it's important to be circumspect when researching; while checking out Skype compatibility I found a user or two online who mistakenly said there was a simple workaround that made it possible to use Skype on a Chromebook, so there's some misinformation floating around out there. (If there is a workaround, it requires some relatively sophisticated software jiggery-pokery and may very well run afoul of your user warranty.)\n\nSo I think that just about covers the things I wish I could have read beforehand while shopping around. All-in-all, it serves nearly all of mom's needs well, and she's happy."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "Let me preface this review by saying I have only had my Chromebook for about 2 weeks so I have probably not fully explored the device. As a junior at Missouri State University the Chromebook seems to satisfy all my needs. I opted to go with the 11.6 inch and am very happy with this size. In most of my classes I do not have very much available desk space, so anything larger would have been cumbersome. I have also had a 9 inch screen in the past and by comparison that is too small. You tend to find yourself hunched over with your face close to the screen and constantly having to scroll up or down or side to side to see a web page. So, in my opinion the 11.6 is a wonderful size for a college student. Also, I carry this device with me in a backpack most days along with various spiral notebooks, textbooks and a 3-ring binder, so it was important to me that my Chromebook be as light weight as possible. The C720 is less than three pounds and its three very useful pounds I'm glad to carry everyday.\n\nPrior to purchasing I read a review that said this was a poor choice for a college student because of the \"programs\" you had to load as a student. I have never been asked to load programs thus far, however, many teachers require you submit course work through various websites. However, given that this product operates on a web based system, this should be no problem. The only issue I have ran it to has been with Connect by McGraw-Hill, which I access for an accounting class. I have never had an issue accessing this site on other computers, but when I enter the site using my Chromebook it I do get a message saying that Connect does not support Chrome OS so some features may not be available. But I am still able to turn in all course work and have not ran across anything I could not do via the Connect.\n\nAlthough I know that the Google based apps such as Google Docs works much the same as I Microsoft Word, I am very loyal to Word. Because of this I have set up an Microsoft Account (which is free) and use Office Online which provides me with almost a full version of Word, Excel, Power Point, Outlook and other parts of the Office Suite. And as a college student, I have access to several computer labs and library's which have full versions of Microsoft Office in the event that there is something I can't do in Office Online.\n\nThe Chromebook boots up and comes to life very quickly, although most times I don't actually turn it off but rather close it and let it go into sleep mode. Even in doing this the battery charge holds very well. I have not actually watched the time to see how many hours I get from each charge, but the clock display in the lower right seems right on target with the amount time you have remaining before you need to charge.\n\nAt first I was hesitant about having a computer that operated almost entirely online. I was afraid that I would not be able to accomplish anything if I did not have internet access. But realistically, there is very little I can actually accomplish without internet access regardless of the computer. Any assignments I submit outside of the class room are submitted via the internet anyway, so it was kind of a moot point.\n\nI don't think I would purchase a Chromebook if it was going to be the only computer I would have access to as there is not much room for storage of music, photos or other media. I have a desktop computer at home that I store those types of things on, as well as access to computer labs on campus for anything that the Chromebook is unable to do. Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase. It has not prevented me from doing anything school related, checking Facebook and Twitter, using apps such as Netflix or Pandora or anything else I have attempted so far."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I waited a while before writing this to make sure I gave it a good go around. My old Sony Vaio laptop had been through a lot and was showing it's age. I decided that, since I was done with school and was never going back (Im in student loan purgatory), I didn't need all the memory or massive programs and a Chromebook seemed like a good replacement. Truthfully, it was not without some hesitation but the price made it easy to give it a try. My review would probably repeat what most people have already said about this so I'll just hit a couple of points.\nThere is an app for just about everything you need and I can download video to an external drive which can be played on the Chromebook. That being said, I would only do that if completely necessary. The sound is good but I found the picture somewhat lacking. I bought a KDLINKS (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IJ142J2/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and can connect my drive to that to watch movies on my tv.\nI see that some people have tried to load software onto this...it's not for that. If you want to use programs then you should be looking at a full laptop or an ultrabook. I wouldn't buy this if you are a serious gamer but it would be great for a student.\nIt's easy to adjust to the smaller keyboard...although if you have man hands you may take a little longer. The screen is small but can be increased if needed (ctrl + if you didn't know).\nI can echo what some people have said about the cheaper feel to the device but I wouldn't expect more for a $200 machine. I found this to be a quick little computer that does well for what it was built for: zipping around the internet and using apps instead of programs. Don't expect to be able to use your itunes account or any other apple rip off, erm, app on here. This is a Google based machine and I, for one, welcome our new overlords."}

The battery might not be as strong as other chromebooks, but it'll last a day's worth with traveling and a few work sessions hear and there. A bit on the heavy side, and the design and look is decent and somewhat sleek. The key board is spacious though no keypad. I'd recommend this machine for developers and techies who'd want their own little playbook for cheap. To the average consumer, It might take a bit getting use to and the apps aren't totally all there, but chrome OS is slowly developing and eventually everything should be covered."}

It also has weird versions of Microsoft Word and Excel that make it very difficult to do projects with. Plus, it only allows google chrome, not firefox or safari (which, I admit is expexcted), which is bad when I need to do a quick assignment and chrome fails or won't load some of my important school sites! It also won't download software through my college (which is free for me) because it doesn't have the software to support it. Basically, it's only good for web browsing, emailing, and google docs. Nothing else for college is supported by this laptop's software!\n\nThis laptop is so beyond frustrating! Spend an extra $20 or so to get the regular version of this laptop, not the Chromebook version!!\n\nThe only good thing about this laptop is its weight, but that doesn't cancel out everything else that's bad about it."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "If you've spent the past 3+ hours comparing chromebooks, fretting over Bay Trail vs. Haswell, considering whether you should use more money on a better notebook... just stop. Stop that right now. Click the buy button. And walk away.\n\nBecause this sh#t is amazing.\n\nIf you have less than 7ish tabs open, even though this thing only has 2gb RAM, it will handle it as good or unnoticeable-y worse than a laptop with a i7 4700MQ. You might view having a certain amount of tabs open as a limitation or brake on your productivity, but, in fact, it forces you to focus on the task at hand, with nothing else open that would clutter your digital workspace. This is one of the greatest virtues of working on a computer, and this little guy will help you achieve it.\n\n Want to watch HD videos? This will do it. It will even play 720p videos at 2x speed using the YouTube HTML5 player, which was pretty awesome. I love watching my Khanacademy videos and certain audio-information-heavy videos at higher speeds to get through videos faster.\n\nAdditionally, ChromeOS is more than \"just Chrome web browser and thats it\". Yes, almost everything \"runs through\" the browser, but once downloaded, a lot of applications run in separate windows with their own little pin in the task bar, just like in Windows 7. It's pretty brilliant.\n\nIn terms of input, the trackpad is pretty great. It, combined with the wizards who made chromeOS, allows for a multitude of amazing gestures that increase productivity, and make this chromebook a blast to use. For instance, holding three fingers on the touchpad and dragging them left and right allows you to SWITCH TABS. Yes, you can do that with ctrl+tab, but I just thought that this was so cool. WHats even cooler is that, in the default theme, you can even see a light move across your tabs as you do this gesture. I like little touches like that; it adds life to the user experience and makes it feel more responsive, and serves functionally because it tells you how much more you have left to drag your fingers until you reach the next tab. This is just one example of many of amazingly cool things that ChromeOS lets you do. From the first time I clicked the trackpad though, I didn't like it. It's unnecessarily loud and does not \"feel\" good.\n\nThe keyboard does require a little getting used to, however. It has very shallow travel; when typing on a table, it almost feels like you're typing on a super-flat keyboard on the surface of that table. It's a strange feeling, and doesn't provide optimum feedback as to whether you've made a keypress or not. Despite this uncomfortable typing experience, it strangely doesn't slow my typing speed down too much once I spent a day or two getting used to it.\n\nSome people have also complained that there isn't a 'double click to hold and drag' feature, but it's been added in one of the updates; whenever you get your chromebook, just quickly update/restart, and it should be available in the accessibility options.\n\nAs a last note, this laptop doesn't provide a right click; however, a tap with two fingers is so intuitive to me, that I started doing it on my other more powerful laptop and being momentarily frustrated that it wasn't doing anything, and forgetting that normal laptops don't do that. This allows for absolutely silent touchpad operation, something that, in some situations, is very convenient. Additionally, anything that functions with middle-click is mapped to a three-finger tap; so closing tabs is doable by three-finger tapping it. Very convenient.\n\nIf something isn't working correctly, like certain websites used by your favorite university that don't work well *cough cough University of Houston Casa online textbooks* you can use Chrome Remote Desktop to access your Windows machine, and comfortably work or read from there. Usually remote desktop services are kind of cruddy, but this one is pretty impressive. I was able to acceptably watch Netflix and Youtube in HD over it; roughly 12-17fps. Not like I needed to, but it was just fun to see how well it handled it. You can easily watch Netflix and Youtube on this processor in HD, don't worry. I tried to play a game from my i7 laptop on this one and... well lets just say it was like 2-5 fps. I'm not sure why this is the case, but it probably has to do with the chromebook having to manage a larger amount of information forward and backward. It would lag especially when I would provide input, so that probably has something to do with it.\n\nOf course, this laptop has standard inputs, just look at the pictures/specs. They all work fine, and sometimes the USB ports recognize peripherals faster than my i7 Windows 7 laptop.\n\nThis is one of the few things I have ever bought which I can solidly give a 5 star review, especially for the value it gives me.\n\nIn summary, convenience, intuitiveness, innovation, and ease of use is worked into the many facets of ChromeOS. This provides for a user experience that is unlike any other currently easily available. Even if you don't want a chromebook, it's worth just trying this out for such a low price and seeing what its like and returning it if you don't like it.\n\nYou might be impressed."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I've had my c720 for more than half a year now. I'm a business student who spends most of her days at school, and fighting for a computer at the computer lab wasn't cutting it :p.\n\nI needed something with Microsoft Office, long battery life, and easy portability. The C720 offers Google's version of Microsoft Office (which isn't too great, see below), a very long battery life, and great portability. The Chromebook has also been quite durable. I've dropped it a few times and although there is a small crack, it's held up better than I thought.\n\nThe C720 has a phenomenal battery life. It was about 8 hours when I first got it, and lasted 8 hours consistently for the first few months. Now, it lasts around 6 hours on a fully charged battery, which is great. I can always count on my Chromebook to last me the whole day when I'm stuck in jury duty or at school and need to binge on Netflix :P.\n\nGoogle's version of Microsoft Office, or what you would call Microsoft Office Lite, was frustrating. It was okay for easy and simple assignments, but for assignments such as for my Business Analytics class which required more advanced use of Excel features, Google Sheets didn't have that functionality. Google Sheets, as you probably guessed, doesn't offer the same ease of use as Microsoft Excel. It's OK, but it's definitely not as easy to use. Google Docs was clunky. Some docs could not be opened either. If you're a university student, chances are, your college offers Microsoft Office for free... I suggest splurging a little more and grabbing a full functionality laptop hybrid instead.\n\nIf there is no internet connection, there's not much you can do on a Chromebook. Google docs and Google sheets won't work.\n\nThe Chromebook is OK for what it is, and if you are sure that you'll be receiving internet access wherever you're using a Chromebook. But in cases where there may not be a reliable internet connection, or actually, in any case, you have MUCH better options.\n\nWhen I was purchasing my C720, it was only about $170. Some lucky people even got the C720 for $42 with a Kindle Fire promotion. It's $200 now, and I highly suggest you look elsewhere. I just ordered an HP stream and will be giving my C720 to a friend or family member. The HP stream right now is $179 and offers full Microsoft Office.\n\nThe C720 is good with web browsing. Pages load quickly. No real problems. Runs Netflix, Amazon Instant Prime smoothly. Sometimes you have to close a few tabs or else it lags, however.\n\nOne of the best parts of the C720 is that it's relatively lightweight and easy to carry around. I can take my Chromebook with me anywhere, and it won't be too big of a convenience vs a real 15-inch clunky laptop. Again, you do sacrifice functionality for a longer battery life and more portability.\n\nIt all depends on your needs:\n\nDo Get:\nMainly checking email\nWeb Browsing\nWatching Netflix or Amazon\nBlogging\nLight business tasks including Google Docs and Google Sheets\nWant something easy to carry around\nWant long battery life\n\nCheck Out Other Options:\nLots of school assignments involving heavy use of Microsoft Excel\nNeed to make a lot of presentation (the Chromebook alternative of PowerPoint is HORRIBLE)\nLots of business functions involving spreadsheets, extensive document editing\n\nAgain, this is a Chromebook, and it's much cheaper than a conventional laptop, which is its beauty. However, you can find so much better elsewhere for a lower price. Hybrid laptops were not a viable option for me when I was buying my Chromebook, but now a lot of new versions have come out, and are giving the Chromebook a run for its money. For instance, HP Stream, IRULU Walk Tablet, etc."}

But here are my gripes:\n- My keyboard has gotten pretty disgusting. Granted, that's mostly my fault, but that also tells you that all sorts of things are going to fall between your keys, with no easy way of getting it out.\n- The screen will make contact with keys/that little line between the spacebar and the touchpad. This creates a dirt line on the screen which can only be removed with water and a cloth.\n- The computer it's self has begun to look dirty. Things almost need scraped off. This surely can't be just me... it's got to be plastic quality or something.\n- I REALLY wish I had more RAM. You start playing music and you can kiss some tabs goodbye. RAM crash kill. (PS, RAM is soldered onto the MOBO, you cannot upgrade it... at least easily....)\n- Once I hit the red in battery, it says I have 15% at 45 minutes remaining. After like 2 minutes, I shoot all the way down to 3% and about 15 minutes. It only keeps going down faster and faster. Until I hit red though, it's pretty awesome still. (~6.5 hrs average)\n- You know when your computer is updated, because everything gets bogged/choppy.\n\nOther than the issues I've noticed above (mostly being that the computer is really susceptible to looking dirty), I still love this thing. I'm more than willing to stick with chromebooks because of the experience I have had with this machine. Though I'll likely opt for a RAM increase.\n*******************\n\nFor anyone looking into a chromebook, you have to be VERY aware that this machine is quite limited. It's still so new of a concept that the app store for it still only really contains the bare essentials.\n\nThat being said however, this machine is excellent for anyone who simply wants to \"get on the internet.\" It will do social media, youtube, netflix, hulu, etc. It does not get bogged down. Tabs upon Tabs upon Tabs can be open and the thing is still doing great.\n\nWhat a chromebook is is a computer built using minimal hardware. Well what good is that? you ask? Well, it doesnt NEED better hardware. The OS is designed to run like melted butter because it does away with background processes. All your protection is based on the web browser because that is where youll do about 90% of your work. Sot a dual core with 1 or 2gb of RAM is actually Plenty. I would however, had liked a larger hard drive\n\nThings to know before you buy.\n\nThis computer has a small SD card slot, which means it will stick out halfway (I bought one before I had the computer with intentions of leaving it in there as more memory, but I scrapped that idea and bought a low profile Flashdrive\nThe computer runs EVERYTHING through Chrome Internet Browser. EVERYTHING. Which means it is virtually crippled without an internet connection\nThe computer has FANTABULOUS battery life. Sometimes listed as being 11+ hours remaining.\nYou will indeed notice some keyboard differences, but that's okay, youll get used to it.\nOnce you are online, it's just like every other computer (however I did notice that saving pictures is tricky)\n\nAnyway, If you're looking for something cheap, quick, reliable and new go, for it man.\nI paid $130 for a refurb of this machine and I love it."}

The file browser (for local files) is clunky and could be improved a bit\n2.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "Acer makes some very decent laptops, and this Chromebook is no exception. It's stylish just enough, very light at under 3 pounds, and has a decent screen that is bright and perfect for indoor use or in bed. Speed is really good - it ran all the apps without any hiccups, most notable the YouTube app in HD. The hard disk drive is very quick, being solid-state variety(SSD). 2GB of RAM is good enough for most everyday usage. I like the fact that it has an HDMI output so I can put my TV if I want more room to play around with.\n\nChromebooks are meant to fill the gap between tablets and full-function laptops, and at $200 this is a decent value. However, being that you can by cheap regular laptops starting from $300, I feel to deserve a full 5 stars, the ideal sweet spot is $150. Since most upper-class tablets start from $200, I feel Chromebooks need to undercut them to really be successful, because ultimately size and weight are the biggest trade-offs Chromebooks compromise, and from laptops is the ability to install and run full programs. So what you are left with is a very small niche, and niches can only survive and thrive at the right price.\n\nA step in the right direction, but still a ways to get there. This makes more sense for those who miss their \"netbooks\" of yore."}

You can easily add/use printers and share them(not only Cloud supported printers - you might need to research just a little - but Google provides directions, just search :)).  I'd also recommend this to anyone who wants to stay connected with their parent, or relative that may also not be versed with technologies.  I work on a lot of PCs for people in my workplace and see the same thing over and over, people having their PC bogged down with toolbars, conflicting spyware/anti-virus - making their computer boot slow, loading pages slow, etc.  I ask them what they generally use their PC for, and the answer is usually the same - Facebook, email, shopping - you get all that functionality via the Chromebook, but without any hassle of system maintenance."}

The exterior also picks up fingerprints fairly easily. I wish that Acer had taken a page from Toshiba's book and used a textured surface.\n\nThe keyboard is comfortable to type on. The screen quality is mediocre compared to most other laptops, but you quickly forget to notice this fact as you use it. This also seems to be the most color accurate of all of the chromebooks I've played with (which isn't to say that it's terribly accurate, but it's certainly better than the HP 14 and the like).\n\nMy only real complaint is that the screen isn't bigger. Prior to this, I've owned mostly 15.6 and 17.3 inch laptops.\n\nThat being said, the screen is nice and wide, and it's an absolute joy to watch netflix on.\n\nAll in all, I'm quite happy with this device.

She can create letters using Google or OneDrive. It has a good keyboard and acceptable display. The USB  allows you to attach a full size keyboard if that makes your life easier.  You can hook the Chromebook up to a TV or monitor with the HDMI port for watching movies.  The main drawback is that a lot of Android apps are incompatible with the Chromebook.  This isn't a problem for my 81 year old mother but would be frustrating for a younger user who wants to use the device for more than homework, internet and email.

And I have been patting myself on the back ever since.\n\nIt is a pretty small computer -- not as small as my 10 inch netbook, but still very small and thin, making it highly portable\nand also the perfect the computer to prop up on your lap when you're not using your main computer (be it laptop or desktop).\nThe screen is truly beautiful and boasts high definition quality. The computer is whisper quiet, you almost wonder if a fan\nhas been installed. Best of all, however, is the internet speed: it is LIGHTNING fast. I use my chromebook\nat the end of large facility where the wireles connection is quite weak, but the computer and the Haswell processor totally make\nup for it -- it is as if I have a DSL or Ethernet connection. I am blown away by the speed, and you will be too\n\nNow again, as reviewers have pointed out, I can't see making this your main computer. That would be a mistake. But\nas a complementary computer, as a portable device you use largely to browse the internet, this is a steal. At $170-$180,\nyou are getting a netbook sized, completely silent computer with a high-definition screen and a lightning fast processor.\nI really don't think it is worth getting the i3 upgrade, given that it is a more expensive computer, this one does the job\nanyway AND the chromebook is likely not going to be your main computer.\n\nThere is nothing more satisfying than getting WAY more bang for your buck in a product, and in the case of the Acer C720,\nyou get it."}

They only have tips for troubleshooting.\nIf you are getting this expecting that you can do some cool stuff with it, think again. Because one wrong move will make your $200 go to waste instantly.\nThere's more good and bad I can say but I won't. Unless somehow I recover my chromebook, then I might post some pros and cons of using chromebook as a programmer/regular use."}

My main concern when I was shopping for a Chromebook was the 2GB of memory. Trust me, it's never an issue. Granted, I am not running Linux or anything on mine, but if you use it for its intended purpose it is quicker than a comparable Windows machine.\n\nI have not missed Windows at all with this device. Everything I use is able to run on a Chromebook. I use Google Voice for Vo-IP calls, Hangouts works for video chats with the family, Docs works and is slowly getting better.\n\nPeople comment on the small screen size, but it doesn't really bother me at all. I'd rather have the ridiculous battery life and the light weight portability of this 11.6 inch model than lugging around a 15-17 inch screen. This thing is the lightest laptop I've ever used.\n\nThe C720 turns on extremely quick, and I'm spoiled by it now. When I go back to my desktop, I leave the room and wait for it to be ready. The Chromebook is just always on and I only have to charge it two or three times a week max (with daily use).\n\nI have been following some of the newer Chromebook releases, and honestly nothing seems to wow me like the C720. Until somebody improves on this model, it will continue to be the Chromebook to beat. Can't go wrong with it at the price either (under $200)."}

Beautiful screen, lovely design, overall a nice laptop.\n\nThe downside is that if you desire much more than a web browser and basic app usage, you will be displeased.

It boots REALLY fast though, and if you intend to use it to browse the web, email & facebook it will do the job nicely. This is **NOT** the device you want if you are interested in gaming of any sort. The screen looks good, so photos and movies (YouTube) work well. If you don't like the OS you can easily boot to a linux distro and they make it easy to switch back & forth between the OSs with a simple keystroke.

This was a brand new laptop to me; therefore I was ridiculously careful and cautious with everything having to do with this computer. I even bought a custom case just to add that extra protection onto the laptop. I went to open my computer recently and the whole screen was pixel-ed and distorted. As a college student, this was devastating. This laptop hit all the right spots at first. It was fast, had great battery life, and was very compact and convenient. The screen breaking was literally out of NO WHERE. I'd understand if maybe I had misused it or accidentally dropped or even touched the screen excessively but nope....it just decided to screw me over. I touched the actual screen maybe twice because I don't like finger prints on  it, sooo i definitely didn't \"abuse\" the screen.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "If you've never used a Chromebook, it won't take you long to figure out. Powered by Googles incredibly user friendly Chrome OS, the Chromebook acts as a web tool that integrates everything Google. The user interface is clean and easy to understand, and any questions you have will be answered on Googles Chromebook Help forums. There is a long list of add-ons that can be downloaded from the Chrome Store, which has everything from themes for your browser to games and Microsofts OneDrive. You can stream video from Youtube, Netflix, and Amazon Instant Video (to name a few), even though the display isn't the best resolution (Apple Retina display, this is not) and is quite small for most peoples standards, though on the side is an HDMI port which allows you to use an external monitor or TV instead. With the built-in camera and microphone, you can make Google Hangout sessions and work on a project with classmates or send documents to one another (similar to Skype). Depending on what you're doing, the battery lasts between 8-9 hours of constant use. Google also throws in a bunch of extra goodies, such as 2 free months of the All Access Google Play service and almost unlimited storage in the Google Drive cloud for two years.\n\nWhile the Chromebook is very versatile and will probably be enough for most people, it quickly shows that it isn't a real laptop and is limited to just Google things. While the store has lots to offer, it is missing tools (like Microsoft Office) that you might want with a traditional laptop.\n\nIn general the hardware is good but not great. The trackpad on the keyboard isn't quite as responsive as Apples or Logitechs (sometimes it has a mind of its own), and I have accidentally hit the power key instead of the delete key twice. You can hear the fan on the bottom of the computer, which might bother you (like a hum in the distance). The speakers are located on the bottom of the laptop and sound tinny at best.\n\nHappily the hardware weaknesses can be easily solved. You can connect an external keyboard and mouse via bluetooth or use one of two USB ports located on each side of the computer and you can use standard mini-jack headphones.\n\nOverall, if you are in need of a cheap laptop and you don't do much on your computer other than use the internet, for 200 dollars the Acer C720 is a great choice with no major flaws."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "This is coming from a MacBook Pro (2.9 ghz, Intel i7, 8 gb RAM) power user--this Chromebook is simply amazing, and loads pages just as fast (or even faster) than my MacBook. And it can take a hit (or three), too.\n\nI'll just highlight a few things:\n\nBuild quality: It felt like cheap plastic out of the box, but for a $199 machine, you can't expect silver and gold. But looks are deceiving. One day, while I was typing up a paper on Open Office (don't ever use this...it doesn't automatically save. Always use Google Docs or Word Online!), and an \"error\" occurred, so I lost three hours worth of work. I was so mad that I threw the Chromebook HARD on my hardwood floor. I did it again. And I picked it up and did it again. I wanted the Chromebook to die. Well, it now has a crack at the bottom (that is replaceable for about $20), and some scratches on the lid, but to my surprise, the darn thing still worked 100%! The hinges were not broken whatsoever. Everything was still in one piece, just scratched and cracked. I was completely sold, and I bought two more for friends and family. Buy it for your kids, buy it for your dog, buy it just to have a laptop to throw around the living room...this thing is as durable as a tank, but as light as a notebook.\n\nThe touchpad: So MacBooks are known to have superior touchpads in the laptop industry, but the Acer's touchpad comes pretty darn close. I usually have to adjust the way I swipe a touchpad on a PC, but I found the Acer's touchpad to not be all that different from the MacBook Pro's, aside from the Acer's plastic touchpad, of course.\n\nThe keyboard: Very comfortable. I have medium sized hands, and I have no problem transitioning from a full-sized keyboard to the Acer's keyboard. No backlit keyboard though, but again, it's a $199 machine.\n\nPerformance: This is where the Acer C720 Chromebook shines. Remember those clunky, snail speed netbooks back in the day? Or how about that cheap, sluggish Windows laptop you saw on sale for $249? This is not one of those slugs. It is a speed demon. Pages load instantly and consistently. In fact, my patience has gotten much worse ever since I've had this Chromebook. The new Intel Haswell-micro architecture (Celeron 2955U) is a must on any Chromebook as of now (unless you're willing to pay more for an Intel i3 version). There really is a big difference in processing power compared to the older generation of Intel processors.\n\nI probably use my Chromebook 80% of the time to take notes, do research, shop online, check email, pay my bills, etc. It's just so much more convenient to take in and out, and I never really have to worry about it dying on me because 7+ hours on one charge is a really long time. The other 20% I use my MacBook to do extensive projects and when I need a bigger screen to do research and type up a paper at the same time.\n\nCase in point: if you aren't sure which Chromebook you want, buy this one now. Upgrade to a fancier looking (but similar performing) one if you decide that you are a Chromebook fan, but for now, this model shows the best value that Chromebook has to offer at an affordable price."}

I won't beat about the bush, so to speak, and just tell you what I don't like:\n\n- The thing is kinda heavy, actually.  Compare it to a Macbook Air (I know, not even in the same price range in any way) and you'll see it feels so much heavier.  The thing is pretty ugly, too.  But for not doing anything other than getting you on Chrome, a web browser, this thing is a bit of a heft\n\n- For large hands, the keyboard is horrible.  I do have big hands, but they're slender (i.e. not fat, just long and big).  I find it very uncomfortable to type on this keyboard.  The keys are very loose in their housings, so you can just brush on the keys and feel them move around and make a very audible noise.  I don't care about the noise at all, but the feel of the keys is that they are small, hard to depress, and move around a bit on you.  I really hate the keyboard, to be honest.  Really hate it.\n\nFor the money, if you are just doing small stuff online, it's fine.  But if you plan on writing extensively (like I did), maybe check out something else."}

If you need specific, PC based software for your work, you need a PC.\n2.  You can't hook up directly to any printer\n3.  Its of little use offline (no internet connection).  This means you will not be able to work without the internet.  The Chromebook relies on online applications.\n4.  You must have a Google account, and all your work will be stored through an app called Google drive.  I put this on the Cons list because some people are not comfortable with this.  Personally, I think you're just as secure as with any machine with internet access.\n\nPros:\n\n1.  You can perform virtually the same functions of Microsoft office and other programs through Google apps (Google Docs, Sheets, ect.), which are free by the way.  In fact, before I purchased mine, I made sure I could open Word and Excel documents through the respective Google apps.  The translation works both ways.\n2.  If you plan to print, you must have access to a cloud capable, wireless printer.  I purchased a Canon printer for this for under $70 and it works great.  This will be easy to identify in the specifications when printer shopping.  You'll enjoy the wireless printer if you've never had one.\n3.  As long as you have internet access, you can do just about everything you can with a PC laptop.  In today's world we are always online, so I don't see this as a barrier.\n4.  You can store all your work in cloud storage, but you can also us internal and external storage.  This is done through your free Google account, and you can access your work from any machine by logging in.\n5.  Great battery life - up to eight continuous hours.\n6.  Extremely light\n7.  Great value.\n8.  It is very easy.  Just about everything is simple on this machine.\n9.  Always starts up, ready to use in seconds.\n10.  Same internet access as any PC.\n\nSo, is a Chromebook right for you?  If you're like most people, probably."}

I regularly leave half a dozen open that I use the most and there they are the second I open the lid. So light I can pass it to my wife with one hand to show her something.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "It cost me $200 abut four months ago. The laptop is light and feels sturdy. I've found it to be a very good investment. I didn't bother too much with ChromeOS. Instead went ahead and install Xubuntu on it. If you're looking to install a unix/linux os on this, it can be a bit tedious. As of the time of writing, any linux amateur can get a *buntu or Arch distro running on it without much work. Debian based distros can also be installed with a little more knowledge. Anything else would be experts only IMO. The main issue is the touchpad driver. I haven't had a single distro containing a proper driver and have had to modify the vanilla kernel to get it working. The suspend is tricky but I've managed to get it working. Once finished setting up, the laptop works amazingly with light distros like xubuntu, lubuntu, arch, crunchbang, elementrary, etc. Running Ubuntu is a bit slow."}

I have an original 4GB and 2GB model,  I purchased two of the 2GB models for my nephew's, I set my sister up with a 2GB-32GBSSD and I just bought myself a 4GB i3.  All of the C720s have been flawless performers as of this writing.  They are fast, reliable, pretty well built, and they are an excellent value.  I've also purchased 2 Chromebook 11's (1st gen with IPS), a Samsung Series 3, and a Toshiba 13.  We also have a Chromebase and a Chromebox.  All of these have been problem free as well.  I have written lengthy reviews for most of these machines, but for this unit I just want to stress what a great value it is.  Be careful of non-Amazon sellers trying to gouge on these machines.  They should cost you $200 or less.  And please take the time to research what a Chromebook is, what it can do, and what it can't do.  The majority of negative Chromebook reviews are written by those who didn't know what it was they were purchasing and bought on price alone.  If anyone has a specific question they would like to ask about the C720 line I would be happy to answer it as best as I can."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "UPDATE 7/02/2015: Almost a year later and I am still in love this Chromebook! Let me tell you, it has been my household's go-to computer. We have one Chromebook, two laptops (one Dell and one HP), and many tablets, but everyone fights over who gets to use the Chromebook. I am going to buy at least 2 more so we don't have to share. LOL! I really don't need a laptop ever again.  This does everything a laptop does and you don't have to worry about annoying virus software, which doesn't work because the computer still gets viruses. But with the Chromebook, no viruses! As far as needing MS Word, Excel, Powerpoint, etc, I have a Microsoft Live account which enables me to access MS Word and others online, and I can later save it to one of my Windows laptop if I really need to. But I don't. I love doing everything on the various Clouds that are out there. Google Docs also has a nice version of spreadsheets and presentation and such if you don't want to set up an Online Microsoft Office account. But I find I do still need the various MS Office products for different things (which I am now almost exclusively using the online versions). All in all, a wonderful investment!\n\nThe Acer C720 Chromebook is a huge hit in my house! We all absolutely love it! I have had this computer for 5 months now and have not encountered any issues. I use it for all my Google needs (GMAIL, YouTube, Drive, etc.) and internet needs. Most importantly, I can watch Netflix, Hulu Plus, and Amazon Instant Video on the computer, or hook it up to my TV via HDMI (was so glad that it had an HDMI port). It allows you to create separate users accounts so that your data is not shared with anyone else who may use the computer. The speakers are wonderful for my needs but I usually put on earbuds so not to disturb others in the house; but when disturbance is not an issue, I let music play through the speakers and it comes out fine. When I want to blast the whole house, I can easily hook my speakers up to the computer with no problems. You cannot save any documents directly to the computer, but you can easily save documents to Google Drive if you need to."}

I was WRONG. I bought this one for my mother while I went to visit for a family holiday and I wound up using this chromebook exclusively for the entire week. This computer is insanely great. Very fast, it actually HAS internal storage so you can download and open documents without a hitch. Used it with a chromecast, no problem. Watched netflix on it a LOT. Sound quality was great, battery life is INSANELY great and it is by far the fastest machine I've ever used. I didn't even consciously realize I was using a chromebook most of the time.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "Having Last year replaced an aging desktop PC with a 15 inch laptop, (with which I am quite happy) many would question my interest in buying a Chromebook. There were several reasons driving this decision. Confined to a wheelchair and nearing 80 years of age, moving the laptop from one place to another is, for me, a major project. Weight, size, and connection to peripherals (printer and scanner) formerly connected to the desktop prevent a simple move. Then there was the question of price. At $200, (later reduced by Amazon to $180) it is hard to argue with the Price to Performance ratio that comes with this purchase. Lastly, there is an astonishing battery life of something around 8 hours of continuous operation.\n\nThat is not to say that all Chromebooks are created equal. Acer, HP, Samsung and Toshiba each manufacture this same version with its 11.6 inch screen size. There are significant differences among them including battery life, keyboard feel, and appearance among a number of criteria which should be evaluated.  After looking at many reviews, the Acer seemed to best meet my needs.\n\nWhichever manufacturer is ultimately chosen, the Internet coupled with a variety of Cloud applications and virtual desktop connections provide access to almost any program which may be needed. With a boot speed of less than 10 seconds, you have the power of a far more expensive system at your disposal."}

I have a desktop and a gaming laptop which isn't ideal to carry around because it's just too big/heavy so I'm really happy with the portability of the c720. I work at home and we have been getting random blackouts lately so it's important for me to be always online. I can't use Photoshop but emails are just as important so the long battery life is a huge plus. After reading reviews, I already prepared myself to be a disappointed with the screen. Surprise! It's not that bad. The screen is a bit dim and the saturation is low but nothing really major. Keyboard, sound, trackpad = all good. I just find the low scores a bit sad because it's mostly from people who can't be bothered researching a product before purchasing one. It's like \"Wow!!! best seller on Amazon. Let me get that laptop.\", when in fact it's not a traditional laptop. If you need something for casual internet use then this is perfect. If I need to choose between a tablet or this, I would pick this (I'm not really an app person). I've only used it for a few hours so I can't give an intensive review but so far I really like it, it's one of the best $200 I've spent.\n\n----------UPDATE----------\n\nI installed Bodhi Linux but I didn't like the reduced battery life (only gives me 5-6 hours) so I went back to ChromeOS."}

Think of your computing needs today: what do you do most? Is it the internet? If so, this machine would work well with your needs. But, if your answer included the use of programs such as Microsoft Word, Powerpoint, or and Adobe product, this machine simply wouldn't cut it. It is build solely for the internet, and anything that you can do on the internet you are able to do on the C720 but nothing else.\nAlso, be mindful of how integral you want this to be in your work. I'm a college student that thought this would be a good fit for the classroom due to its small footprint and inexpensive nature. However, as I type this review, the keyboard is somewhat annoying, contrary to some other reviews that rave about its quality. The plastic used in the keyboard is easily bent, and this is seen in the spacebar which bent down on both sides, making the center of the key the only usable area.\nIn general, if you are a student looking for a second device that you don't want to worry about or a parent looking to buy a first computer for your kid, this is the one for you.

The keys are big and spaced out for touch typing with a nice feel to them. The display is clear and vibrant. Web pages load quickly and the 2GB is more than adequate.\nI did not try the speakers, but I did plug in an old infra red mouse into the USB 2.0 port and it works fine.\nThe only thing I found so far that I don't care for is the requirement to enter your user password at log-in. It's probably a wise security measure but I find it annoying.\nAlso, be careful during the initial setup.

This baby does a lot on 2 gigs of RAM, with plenty of power for HD videos (try running 10 at once, its barely winded!) inside lies the hugest battery I've ever seen. The 7 hour battery life is not a lie. Actually, it is, as mine lasts up to 9. And it charges crazy fast. Whether you like Chrome OS or Ubuntu, this computer is. for. you."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I researched all the current Chromebook offerings as of this writing.  This Acer c720 is the best value presently in my opinion.  The performance gain from the Intel Haswell chip outweighs other factors from competing models.  I did consider the Asus C200 and the HP11 first generation because of its beautiful in-plane-switching display but the performance of the ARM based processors couldn't stand against the zippiness of the Acer c720.\n\nThe build quality, fit and finish, keyboard and trackpad are adequate.  The display is nothing spectacular but I've used it now without issue for a few days.  The contrast isn't up to par with high-end panels but at this price point it is sufficient.\n\nBattery life has been greater than 8 hours with web surfing and sporadic video/ audio streaming.  I purchased this from an amazon competitor because I had a loyalty coupon that combined, beat amazon's price in this instance.\n\nThe machine feels very zippy.  I've had multiple tabs open, and not experienced any stuttering or lag while performing tasks.  Highly recommend.  Withholding one star because display contrast could be improved."}

I like the quickstart, seems to be a very solid build, can save pdfs, and do the other things I need to do without the boot times, weight, and financial investment of another windows PC.  I have no problem adjusting to the keyboard, though I do prefer to use a conventional mouse.  I am also able to access my windows PC by using chrome remote desktop which works just fine.  I was able to compare this model to four other chromebook models at a local electronics store while traveling - I chose this one for having the most solid build.  I removed the HUGE label on the chromebook by blowing with HAIR DRYER on high about a minute - came right off in one piece with ease."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "This is an excellent everyday machine for common office tasks and daily browsing. I ordered this as part of the kindle deal several weeks ago so I have had some time to play with it and become accustomed to the Chrome OS. The following are several points that I have observed with the hardware and software:\n1) For the cost, it is an inexpensive machine that will accomplish most daily tasks that many people have.\n\n2) Document handling: Specifically, the Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, and Draw apps may be used in place of Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, respectively. Google Draw can be thought of as Adobe Illustrator \"Light\". I use Google Docs the most and you can save a copy of the document in a variety of formats with the Word format being my most used. Therefore, you can still interface with Microsoft Office users. The only catch is that when someone sends you a Microsoft Office document to edit, you cannot comment on it (the chromebook uses the QuickOffice app to open these Microsoft formatted documents). To circumvent this, I have used the Microsoft Office online suite of productivity apps which works admirably. I already have an xbox log-in so I didn't need to create a new user. Also, it is important to note that you can work on documents off line.\n\n3) The battery life is outstanding. I can do a good days work on this machine no problem. On top of that, charging the battery is very quick. Generally, it takes less than 2 hours.\n\n4) For video calls to my friends and family, I typically use Google Hangouts, but if you have Skype you will have no luck as currently, there is no support for Skype on the Chromebook.\n\n5) The keyboard is acceptable. The spacing of the keys is very good and I have no trouble typing. Although, I do find that the keys have a mushy feel to them, which if I am in a mood, can be grating. The track pad is good as it is smooth, and gives a satisfying \"click\" when pressed.\n\n6) There is no \"Caps Lock\" key, the shortcut is \"Alt+search\" and the \"Delete\" key is replaced by the shortcut \"Alt+backspace\". There are other shortcuts as well, all of which are easily accessed in case one forgets through using \"Ctrl+Alt+?\". I have no trouble with this whatsoever.\n\n7) The display, while not exceptional, can be extremely bright and is plenty sharp for a $200 laptop. I mostly keep it at 50% because I don't like extremely bright displays.\n\n8) There is no trouble having multiple tabs open, I have experienced no slow down in performance after having 12 tabs open (this has been my max). Of course, those tabs were mainly text. I have not tested having multiple video-graphic-intensive tabs open.\n\n9) Having 16 GB available is fine by me, I am a heavy user of Google Drive and the extra 100 GB for 2 years is even better. I have not passed using more than 2 GB at any given moment. There is an SD card for expansion, but when put in, it is not flush with the computer as it juts out a bit. So having an SD card permanently in the slot is not an option.\n\n10) A very big plus is the fact that you don't have to worry about security as google constantly updates the OS with the lastest and greatest so no need for an anti-virus suite. (All that is required is a restart when indicated.)\n\nOverall, I was concerned about having a laptop where functionality is anchored to having a WiFi hotspot, but this was unfounded as I have yet to encounter a location where I work that lacks such capability. I would recommend this to anyone who needs an inexpensive machine to work on or as a secondary computer. Integrating into the Google ecosystem for new users may take some getting used to, but it is worth it in my opinion. I for one am very happy that I chose to make this purchase.\n\nUpdate 08/02/2014: I omitted mentioning how to print from a Chromebook. If you have an older printer that is not capable of being Google's Cloud Print-ready (as I do), you must have the printer connected to a computer logged into the same Google account that is being used on the Chromebook and use the Google cloud print option. This is a bit of a hassle admittedly, but I rarely have to print at home."}

What can I say, the price was unbelievable at $59 and free shipping.  I didn't know as much as I do now about the Chrome-life, but for the money I paid I have no complaints. There is no JAVA, but I can live with that.  I am so NOT a fan of Google that I cringe that the product is Google-driven for the most part. It is not particularly friendly when it comes to featured programs, but I keep going back to the price I paid to justify the fact I still have it.\n\nI'm considering donating it to someone who needs it for college note-taking and who doesn't mind Google. There might be a way to use other email servers, but the default server is all Google.\n\nI can say with assurance that I don't think I'd purchase this for the going price of $200 unless I needed something with an actual keyboard for meeting or classroom notes.\n\nIt is possible to watch the ESPN app on the Chromebook; also, if you like POGO you can play flash games on this.\n\nLast, but not least... I LOVE Acer products.  I have had Acer computers that are workhorses and I'd buy one tomorrow. This product is Acer, but it is Acer using Google's chrome platform, thus... in my opinion, it's a step backwards for Acer.\n\nI'm being generous with 4-stars, but I'm giving it an extra star because Acer's are well-made.  Chrome-only it would get 3-stars."}

You need wifi, but you can get by without in a pinch. You can write off line and the moment you are online, everything updates.\n  Want to Facebook? This machine is more than capable. Games? I have yet to find a flash game that this machine will not play! No slowing, flickering...etc.\n  I had an option to buy a year of breakage coverage. Sadly, did not take it. (Bestbuy) The second day I had it, I managed to drop it from about 3 feet off the ground onto concrete. Landed on a corner. Lid opens perfectly, screen is still perfect, I was amazed. This machine can take a hit.\n  It weighs next to nothing, starts in about 7 seconds. Lift the lid and by the time your fingers get to the keyboard, start typing your password, and you on online. Perfect for writers.  Battery life of 9.5 hours when just writing.\n  This machine impressed me. I have had HP, Lenovo, and Toshiba laptops in the past. The Chromebook holds its own.

I have been using an iPad at home for 5 years now and finally got fed up with how difficult it is to get anything done beyond surfing the web. The typing on the iPad is completely useless to me and actually discourages me from emailing with friends and family. In addition, the lack of usable applications makes it difficult to organize my life. Enter Acer's C720 Chromebook. Right out of the box I was impressed with the fit and finish, given the price point. Certainly exceeded expectations. Its compact, lightweight, and intuitive and easy to use. The solid-state hard drive rocks and started right up in less than the advertised 7 seconds. Great keyboard with the right amount of spacing between keys and very short travel for quick and accurate typing. Google aps are fantastic and offer everything I need for basic spreadsheet and word processing use. Finally a powerful yet usable tool I can use to help organize my life, stay in touch with friends and family, and surf around on the web. $600 for a new iPad? No thanks. This is the future of computing.\n\nUPDATE 12/15/15: My Acer C720's fan began to go haywire on my. It was running constantly (draining the battery) and making a jet engine like whooshing noise. I called Acer customer service and they informed me the very best they could do was to service the Chromebook for $179- the price of a brand new one! Horrible service Acer and thus I'm taking my review from 5 stars to 3. Not to be defeated, I decided attempt the repair on my own by purchasing a fan assembly from Amazon:\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Acer-Chromebook-Heatsink-Cooler-60-SHEN7-005/dp/B00Q3K41VA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1450154759&sr=8-1&keywords=acer+c720+chromebook+fan\n\nThe part cost $19.99 went in with no problems in less than 15 minutes. Thanks for nothing Acer and two thumbs up to Amazon for stocking the parts I needed to make the repair. Now my C720 runs like new and no more annoying, battery draining, jet engine sounding, hyperactive cooling fan.\n\nMy advice to any who are reading this is to try the equivalent Samsung offering. From what I have read, they are a bit more robust. Overall, I'm amazed at the concept and functionality of the Chromebook and highly recommend to anyone who has grown tired of trying to type on an iPad."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I've been using this for the past few weeks and am simply amazed at this chromebook!  It has become my number one \"computer\" to use in my home.  The battery charge lasts four to six hours playing my videos and listening to music on one charge.  I can use this chromebook off and on all day long and not have to recharge the battery.  It's very light and doesn't get warm like a notebook computer does.  I'm guessing the SSD helps a lot since it has no rotating parts and keeps heat generation low.  I bought this purely for entertainment so I can't say anything about using it for productivity.  The screen is well lit and fully adjustable as is the sound from the keyboard.  Oh, about the sound level: For some reason the sound is quite loud for such a lightweight device.  It is louder than my notebook computer by far.  My family often has to ask me to turn it down.  Sound quality is very good from the built in speakers.  The built in mouse pad works well but I have plugged a USB mouse into it and it worked well.  Anything negative?  Not really sure why but some Bluetooth devices will not synch with it and sometimes when they do they do not stay connected.  I've tried to connect my Jawbone HD to it so I can listen to music through the Jawbone but it won't connect.  My Bluetooth speakers however do connect and work well.  Maybe the O.S. will be updated in the future to handle this??  Other than that I have no issues with it ."}

However, there was no advanced notice that this is not a touchscreen device. My daughter has a similar product and hers is touchscreen, so I thought that the feature was universal to the Acer Chromebook product. It wasn't until after I received this device and touched the screen that I realized that one of its most attractive features (to me) was absent.  After doing a little digging, I discovered that it was noted in some of Amazon's customer product reviews that for $100.00 more, the next level up product is touchscreen. Would have been nice to know beforehand.\n\nAlso, this not a laptop.  I was hoping that the Chromebook functioned more like a laptop, affording me the ability to download software for equipment that I have that requires its software to be installed on a computer.  There is no slot for cd installation and the Chromebook does not support the software that is required to operate the equipment.  So I am stuck with my old computer until I purchase an actual laptop."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "Loving it!  I was trying to decide between this one and the Asus c200, and decided to go for this one because of the faster processor. My concern with choosing the Acer over the Asus was the fan, as I have to run a flash based T.V show on the computer for hours at a time. The fan in the Acer is amazingly quiet, even in a silent room with the video running, I don't hear the fan unless I put my ear right up to the computer. So I'm happy I gambled with the Acer over the Asus. I think they are probably both fantastic products, but for me speed was more important than an extra 3 hours battery life, and the fan turned out to be a non-issue (for me anyway)\n\nThe only other Chrombook i've owned is the Samsung 3 series, this Acer is obviously much faster, the battery last way longer, and I think the screen is slightly better quality, although both screens have a slight bluish tint to them when comparing to my 2010 glossy macbook pro, which looks very \"white\" & bright."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I love this little computer, my every day use computer died and I was in desperate need for a new one, but did not have the funds.  I was SHOCKED to find the chromebook! I love it, it does everything I need it to do, and is the perfect computer for those on a budget who need something to do general work on.\nThe great things about this: it runs super fast, no need to 'wait' for it to start up.  It turns on and off just like a phone (faster than a smartphone). It uses my already set up google account, which made it super easy.  I was already using chrome so using it was completely natural.  The battery life is amazing!! For someone who is used to getting an hour and a half, MAYBE two, this thing is great! Of course when you are streaming or things like that, the battery goes faster, but when just doing average work it goes for hours.  It also has a nifty thing that tells you how much longer you have until the battery runs out. I am amazed that for the price it works as well as it does. I do beat on it a bit, so the charger has bent where it goes into the laptop, and I have a few scratches including a little scratch type thing in the mouse pad. However, again, for the price, it is holding up very well.\nThe mouse pad is difficult to deal with, copying and pasting is not very easy, as highlighting things is difficult.  Easily solved by getting an external mouse.\nI didn't know about chromebooks when I purchased it, so I was unaware of how they worked. I didn't realize I wouldn't be able to use some programs on it, such as skype and other messaging programs.  Thankfully google has its own, but a lot of the people I speak with (I work from home) would rather use skype.  I was also a little disapointed at the games :( I can't download any (obviously, thats part of the reason it works the way it does) and I just wasn't expecting that, it does have its own google apps, but they leave a little to be desired, and any games that are just a free trial, you are not able to get the whole version, because you can't download it onto the computer. And while it does have the basic programs that work like microsoft office, they can't really compare to the office software. Also I had to get a new printer as mine plugged in, and there is no way to download the software.  It requires a wireless printer. This however, was my own misconception as I did not realize how they worked when I bought it.\nThis is the reason I give it four stars, I know this is the way it is supposed to work, and why it is so inexpensive, but I feel there are a few things that could have been done to make it a little bit better.\nHowever, I would certainly recommend this to anyone who is looking to get a inexpensive computer. It would be great for students, a second computer or for anyone who is just looking to have the ability to get online and access basic programs. Perfect for younger kids as it is a laptop, but they can't download a million things to it!"}

It's such a great choice for students or business people that need something lightweight and compact for commuting purposes and for simple tasks such as typing up reports. Although the Chrome Store is a little barren at the moment, there are quite a few treasures if you dig around long enough. A Chromebook is a wonderful choice for someone that is looking for a distraction-free sort of computer (I say distraction-free as in there are no huge games that can be installed, negating the temptation to shirk off work and just play for hours). Sure, you can download a few games off of the Chrome Store, but they're like any other mobile game: easy to pick up and put back down.\nMy only - and seriously, my only - complaint is that the Acer model doesn't have a backlit keyboard. A small feature, but it is something I would have loved to see. Still, this one lacking feature isn't enough for me to box is back up and return it.\nOverall, I am insanely in love with this computer. It's so lightweight and wonderfully powerful that I cannot wait to bring it to school and such. I highly recommend Acer over any other brand of Chromebook."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I briefly owned the Pixel. While it was an amazing computer, I couldn't nearly justify the price. When this refurb went on sale for $150, I ditched the Pixel and ventured into what I thought would be a far lesser ChromeOS experience. I was wrong. Now, clearly the Pixel screen was better and was just faster overall. But really, for 1/6th the (craigslist) price this is /at worst/ 90% of the experience. I think I touched the Pixel's touchscreen twice. Once when I bought it, and once to show it off to the guy I sold it to.\n\nAs far as features, they're pretty straight forward, meaning they work when I need them to and I don't miss any from past computers. Battery is outstanding: 6-8 hours of normal use. Connecting via HDMI to external screens is flawless. Video playback is smooth. Speakers are too loud for my desk. Keyboard and touchpad have a great response. The finger-tapping rather than full clicking is better than on my wife's Mac.\n\nA few downsides, but not deal breakers: It sometimes doesn't register three-finger clicks (open link in new tab). I find I have to spread my fingers farther than I think to register the click. Actually, I lied. That's the only downside I've found in 4 or 5 months of use.\n\nI came from a heavy Linux work flow and thought Chromebooks would make nice Linux laptops. I went through the Crouton/Crubuntu install, but found I would go weeks without switching to Linux. The only reasons: torrents and Dropbox. (Tip: Install Dropbox via Crouton to ~/Downloads and you'll be syncing on the ChromeOS side.) I've since switched nearly entirely to Drive -- Congrats, Google. You've won another convert. -- and haven't switched to the Linux side for a long while.\n\nMy current work occasionally requires Office docs to be edited. Fortunately they've switched us to O365 and I can now use the online versions of Office apps on ChromeOS on those rare occasions it's needed. I was already used to not having access to Office from my Linux time.\n\nPrinting is fine a long as /some/ computer is constantly connected. I probably print four times a year anyway.\n\nI have since bought this exact laptop as gifts for friends (group-buys...it's so cheap!) and am looking to get the LG Chromebase soon for my at-home desktop. ChromeOS is fantastic, and this laptop is so cheap and without flaws that I can't imagine buying it to just try out the Googleverse. I bet you'll get hooked!"}

Happened upon this in Best Buy and have it a whirl on sites I frequent.\n\nIt performs very well, has a capable file-management system, and it has 2 USB ports and an SD card slot, which makes it perfect for transferring photos, videos, whatever while you're not at home.\n\nI think it's way better than a tablet because of the keyboard and trackpad and full computer webpages, and with the google suite, especially Drive, at your fingertips, the hard drive size won't even enter your mind.\n\nI use it all the time, even when I'm at home.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "It is just advertised. Great little machine. Cheap, but don't be fooled. 2GB RAM and Celeron 1.4 GHz may seem little low, but it is more than enough to do what this machine is supposed to do: browse, do a little work on the go, notetaking, netflix, etc.\n\nPro:\n- Boots up very fast\n- Everything launches very fast\n- Very thin and lightweight, I was surprised when I pick it up the very first time\n- Very responsive, never had any lag problem\n- The built-in is loud, even louder than my full-size Lenovo laptop\n- HDMI output, can't complain about this\n\nCon:\n- Plastic build. Honestly, this could go either way. Plastic makes it cheaper to build and light to pick up.\n- Screen quality is not the best, it looks a bit washed out\n- Coating on the screen is subpar. I had a stain (couldn't remember how it got there) I can't get rid of. It's a small one, and it's my fault, so I'll let this slide.\n- Keyboard layout is not my top preference. Does NOT have Delete, Home, and End keys which I am used to.\n\nIt will take a while for some of you to adjust to this little beauty. The more I use it, the more I love this. 16GB is more than enough for me, and for most people. If you want to pick up the 32GB model, there is nothing wrong with that."}

High quality graphics, zippy performance, and lightweight... all the things I was looking for under $200.\n\nWhile it performs just fine and instantly connected to all of my Google-based online assets without hesitation, there are a few things that disappointed me:\n\n1) The keys are loose and rattle a lot when you press keys, click the mousepad, etc.  It feels cheap.\n\n2) The mousepad also feels loose.  When you touch or tap it, it moves slightly.  Works fine, but again... feels cheap.\n\nYou might be thinking... you bought a cheap Chromebook, so don't be surprised that it feels cheap.  Ok, fair enough. Consider this a public service for future buyers.\n\nAll in all, I'd buy it again to get the lightweight performance and price-point that it offers."}

Otherwise you must get a computer that is Google Cloud print ready, which is not the sane as just a run of the mill wireless printer.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I've never been happier with an Amazon purchase, and I buy a lot from here. First let's talk about the machine itself. The keyboard is amazing. I would rather type on this than anything else. The track pad is flawless. You can use the two finger swiping to scroll, or do it horizontally to go 'back' or 'forward' in the browser. If you use 3 fingers and swipe horizontally, you can glide through your chrome tabs. It's very effortless and very smooths. I was surprised to see that this machine handles full HD footage from my Sony Action Cam with no problems at. I even moved some of the video from a trip to the Google Drive folder and Google automatically made a story book for me, with GPS mapping and everything, it was pretty cool. It must have compared the time stamps on the footage to where my phone was at the time. The screen is great for the money. The viewing angles are not that bad, in fact you only really notice the difference from tilting the screen vertically. Horizontally there's hardly any difference at all.\n\nChrome OS is a dream. Super fast and super simple. I bought this Chromebook mainly as a tool to help me practice programming, and there's plenty of online and offline Chrome app IDEs to choose from. My favorite being \"Caret\" for offline and local editing and programming, and \"Cloudenvy\" for online editing. What great about it is that I can tote this around any where and just hack away, for about 9 hours!!! Also if you're worried about the OS's limitations you can dual boot linux on the machine and switch between the two without any problems. Instead of doing that though, I like to use Chrome OS's built in remote desktop app to access my Windows desktop at home. This works perfectly when I have to do some quick photoshopping or things of that nature."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "If you want a laptop to use ONLY for internet browsing and maybe some word processing then this is a great machine at an amazing price. If that is all you want to use it for then I think you will be very satisfied with this laptop. It has enough CPU speed and RAM to be quick and responsive, and the whole interface in general is user friendly. For $200 this little guy is just phenomenal.\n\nHOWEVER, you must understand that none of your Windows software - not one single program - is compatible with a Chromebook. Yes, you can open and edit your Word and Excel documents via Chromebook compatible software. But that's about it.\n\nThe thing about the Chromebook operating system is that it is 99% web-based. What that means is that it can only run programs that operate on a web browser. So if there is some program that you access on the web and it runs solely through your web browser you will not have any problem. But if there is a program installed on your current computer's hard drive and you want to be able to use it on your new Chromebook, the answer is no. Unless the program can be run through a web browser or there is some Chromebook compatible \"app\" (and for Word and Excel there is) you will not be able to run the program on your Chromebook. Even if it is a very simple game or other program that is installed on your current PC you cannot install it/run it on Chromebook. You cannot install programs on the hard drive and run them off of the hard drive. At all. That is not how the Chromebook operating system works. Everything goes through the internet. If it cannot be accessed and operated entirely via the web then it cannot be operated on your Chromebook.\n\nSo, folks, give it some real thought before you make the purchase. Is there a program or two on your current computer's hard drive that you expect to be able to operate on your new laptop? If the answer is \"yes\" then you may be very disappointed if you make this purchase. If you want a laptop solely for surfing the web, using Word and Excel, and performing other functions that can be done entirely via the web then I think you will love this laptop. I encourage you to do some research on your own into what Chromebook applications are available that could serve as substitutes for a program that you currently use on Windows. Just understand that Chromebook cannot run your Windows software - no matter how small and simple the program - unless: (1) the same program can be operated entirely through a web browser; or (2) there is a Chromebook application specifically designed to be compatible with the software."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "The Acer C720 is a fitting upgrade to the C710. It's lightweight, speedy, comfortable, and really cheap. For my life, I find myself not ALWAYS needing the power of a Core i7, and honestly, you can do every basic tasks within a browser without any issues. That being said, for some people, this will be a SECONDARY laptop, not a primary machine. Don't expect to play big games, edit video (well, you can do video editing, it's just subpar), or do any crazy photoshop tricks (although photoediting is more than do-able on this device).\n\nWhen all is said and done, this machine is amazing for what it does. It's a glorified web browser for an OS, but that doesn't have to be a bad thing. In fact, the C720 is unapologetically a web only machine. Where offline apps exist however, I never really find my MacBook or my PC useful when there's no internet anyway.\n\nIf you're looking for a great secondary machine that is light, fast, and reliable, go for a Chromebook. Go for THIS Chromebook. For $200 it is a bargain nobody should skip out on."}

Fast to start, quick sleep and return (just open and close the cover and it instantly sleeps and resumes). Great battery life.  Good cloud integration.

Bought one for my father and mother.  $200 and exceeds utility and performance (except it cannot run Window's only programs, but for 99% of people everything is available on the Web and through apps for the device).  Get the basic version, it is all you will need.\n\nTwo finger clicking for \"right\" clicking can be a bit tricky and gets getting used to.  I often use the old-fashioned shortcuts of Cntl-C and Cntl-V for copy and paste and Cntl-X to cut.\n\nI'm amazed I can work with the small screen size.  And it makes it a breeze to take anywhere.

The trackpad is better than my Lenovo's, the keyboard is good but not backlit.\n\nIt's small enough, but doesn't feel so small that it's uncomfortable to use (I'm 27 though). It's really light and easy to carry with the Terra Sleeve."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I purchased this with specific plans of loading Xubuntu 14.04 using Chrubuntu. After a little tweaking (there are some wonderful guides on the web), this thing runs beautifully. Makes an outstanding Xubuntu performer. By far the fastest-running personal laptop I've personally used. Can't ask for a better computer at this price.\n\nA few comments, which can either be construed as negatives, or at least something for a buyer to be aware of:\n\n1) The touchpad is very poor, in my opinion. It is very responsive when moving the cursor about the screen, but since the buttons are integrated into the touchpad itself, whenever I go to left-click something small, my cursor inevitably moves just a hair and I end up missing. Frustrating. But still, it's usable, and you have to remember you get what you pay for.\n\n2) When lid is closed, and laptop is packed in a bag for transport, it takes very little pressure to \"push\" the screen against the keyboard/touchpad area. I continue to experience little lines of grey \"paint\" from the sharp edge between the keyboard and touchbad getting rubbed onto the screen during transport. I actually went as far as putting a thin strip of masking tape along that edge to help prevent this. It wipes off easily enough with a slightly damp cloth, but again, frustrating. Again, it's good to keep in mind that you get what you pay for. This laptop does not utilize the highest quality materials or hardware.\n\n3) The keyboard feels cheap. This may be more preference than anything, but it's a comment shared by many. There is not much of a tactile response to the keys, and as I type on it, I can't help but wonder if the keys will break one day. I'm a typist who happens to hit the keys with a bit of authority, so maybe this is more of a concern for individuals like me than for most users. I find myself making a deliberate effort to \"go easy\" on the keys. Again, you get what you pay for.\n\n4) The RAM is soldered in. This is an important point for those who had any aspirations of upgrading this from 2GB of RAM to 4GB. I can understand soldered parts as a manufacturing expedient to keep costs down, but this is frustrating to me only because the 4GB version of this laptop is sold for so much more, which tells me the limitation is more marketing driven than it is manufacturing cost.\n\n5) The SSD is *very* easy to swap out. This was a huge plus for me, as I found 16GB to be far too small to house both Chrome OS and Ubuntu partitions. I went ahead and upgraded to 64GB SSD for about $50. There are great video guides for swapping out the SSD on the web. Very simple, but obviously voids the warranty. Still, I imagine most users will find the 16GB sufficient.\n\nConclusion:\nI couldn't be more pleased with this laptop for the price. If you're computer savvy and want a solid, affordable system to run Linux on, then look no further. This should make a solid daily use laptop for me for several years, provided I remain cognizant of its limitations and take care of it."}

He thought a Chromebook would be too limiting for his needs and would be more like his Kindle Fire HDX than a laptop. I'm glad to say he is pleasantly surprised and is constantly surfing on it every night. Primarily he is surfing, researching, watching videos, and buying and selling on eBay. He was originally worried about PDF handling, but found it preformed just fine. It's also much, much faster than his old computer--something he especially loves. At only $140, this was a very affordable deal for us. We're very happy with the purchase."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "Great value at this price point. Unbeatable, really. Boots fast. Great battery life compared to other laptop computers I've owned. If you have a monitor with HDMI (I'm actually using HDMI to DVI) you can use it with a larger external monitor in docked mode when you are at home, and you want something larger than the 11.6\" screen. Compact, sleek and lightweight. I've had this Chromebook for about seven months and I've used it constantly, since early February.\n\nThis also pretty much replaces my home-built desktop. I put this Chromebook in docked mode, connected to a 20\" external monitor, and a Logitech wireless mouse/keyboard combination with the unifying receiver. (...requires one-less usb port if you use the unifying receiver) I don't see much (if any) drawback using it this way, in desktop configuration, than using an actual desktop computer. For instance, my Chromebook will stream Netflix, whereas my Linux desktop would not. Much smaller footprint than my previous tower desktop configuration. You can eliminate some of your traditional rats nest of desktop computer wires, and desktop clutter, if you make do with the built-in Wi-Fi and the Chromebook's built-in speakers.\n\nSomeone just recently pointed this out to me: if you're looking for a better VoIP experience than the built-in microphone will offer, the jack on the left side of the computer is a combination headphone/microphone jack to accommodate a wired mic, and there is also bluetooth capability. This, in conjunction with your Google Voice supplies you with free VoIP telephony.\n\nAnd, obviously, it's portable. For coffee houses and the couch or armchair, vacation and anywhere there's WiFi available.\n\nI should mention that, while it's possible to install a Linux OS on this machine, I can't recommend that. I've attempted it. It's complex, compared to what it was like installing an operating system on my previous netbook, unless you just have a lot more patience than I do. Anyway, the Chrome OS works just fine, so personally I'm not sure what would be the point, from my perspective.\n\nThis Chromebook is a fantastic value at $200. Does everything I need."}

Basically you have a tiny drive and have to store most of your files / documents on that great big cloud in the sky. (The bonus to that is that you can access those documents from anywhere, since they aren't stored in a single computer's drive.) And you will have to stick with Google apps like Chrome browser or the Google Docs office suite that come pre-installed. But if you can live with those minor limitations, you will find that the Chromebook can handle most of your basic laptop-ing needs -- from surfing the web to chatting on Facebook, streaming videos, etc. etc. I have owned mine for over a year and recently purchased another to give as a gift.

A little background, I am an IT analyst for a large utility company and have been working with and repairing computers for almost 20 years. I never buy new desktop's but I have purchased a few laptops for the convenience of portability.\n\nI love this little powerhouse, it boots in less than 5 seconds, says seven but I haven't really seen it take that long. You are on the internet and ready to go within 5 minutes of powering it on for the first time.\nThe machine is really light but does not feel cheap. The keyboard is quick and responsive and the touch pad is easy to use. It comes with an SD card reader which make it easy to view pictures off your digital camera(if it uses SD cards) or transfer files without a USB thumb drive. You can easily hook this to your HDTV using an HDMI cable to watch your internet shows or home movies. It also has USB ports and other specs that you can see in the product details.\n\nWe have had this for about a week and have had to charge it twice, the battery lasts at least 8 hours of use and maintains a strong charge while in standby mode. The Chromebook returns from standby about as quick as it powers on.\n\nThe machine is really quiet and does not get hot, so it is great to use at night or on your lap.\n\nI do not have any complaints with so far with the Chromebook and would recommend this to anyone. I feel like a Chromebook would be great to bring elderly or new people to the internet and computing.

If you accept it for what it is, then it's quite impressive.  If you are rating it low because you think it is a laptop, you are not being fair. It is what it is, a web browser with add-ons. That being said, it has a quick easy access to the internet. The picture quality and sound are sufficient. I have no problems using it as an extra web browser when my kindle fire is too small for me to watch a Yankee game or you tube(my eyesight is not the best)My Alienware computer is too bulky to lug around and as I said sometimes my Kindle is too small. This is a perfect browser to bring to the beach or away on vacation. I have absolutely no complaints about this chromebook and that is unusual because I have always considered Acer as crap. Sorry Acer. It performed beautifully right out of the box. I can't speak for it's apps, because I don't use them and it took a little adjustment to get use to a non windows OS. I'm fairly deaf, but a can hear it well, I wouldn't listen to Mozart on it. A high definition baseball game is perfectly fine.\n I don't know what else to say other than if you expect it to perform as a full blown computer you will be disappointed. I get so upset reading the one star reviews from people thinking they were getting a $2000 computer for $200, they obviously just looked at the picture and price and said \"wow a cheap computer\" Know what you are looking for and either save up your money for a laptop or PC or appreciate this as a good backup browser or a nice light unit to travel with. Mechanically, it performs perfectly,\nPS I noticed a consumer's complaint about people giving this 5 stars because they got it on a lightning deal for $59 like I did. That's a fair statement. However if you do your research and know what this product is, I would still give it a 5 star rating, if I paid regular price. Acer has come a long ways and it does exactly what it says it does."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I thought this would be like a mini PC laptop. It's nothing like it. There's no \"desktop\" to put things on, no \"control panel\" very little in the way of settings, even as far as display choices, and has limited storage space. Most of all files, docs, photos, etc, either has to go on an external device, or go to Google Drive/Cloud if you have a lot of them. There is no CD/DVD drive so all games, music, movies, work, etc, will not be usable if it's on a disc. No windows/MSN programs work on it either. Google is in charge of EVERYTHING. There is a Google Docs, and something similar to Word.\n\nThis works OK for web surfing or watching movies online, checking email, etc, but if you like games other than ones you find online, forget it! Google will not let you shop at the Google Play Store (I was told it's for Android only), where the good apps are, but only allows Chromebook owners to get their (very limited and really crummy) apps from the Chromebook Store. I don't understand this because they will allow you to purchase movies, books, and music from the Play Store.\n\nThe keyboard is terrible, and I'm having a difficult time adjusting to it. The keys are nearly flat and oddly spaced, making it hard to not hit the wrong ones, and some of them (arrows, etc) are in a different place altogether. There's no delete or cap lock buttons. They removed delete and replaced cap lock with a search button. To delete, you have to use alt+backspace. This gets to be inconvenient and annoying. For cap lock it's alt+search. The power button is right above backspace, and I've inadvertently turned off the machine many times while aiming for backspace. I don't know who the genius was that thought these changes would be a good idea, but that person should be demoted to the mail room.\n\nOne of the worst things is, It's incompatible with many printers, including the one I just recently bought (even though it's wireless), and it won't work connected by USB either (no printer will). I will not be buying another printer any time soon, so until I can get another PC, I have to hope I won't need anything printed.\n\nI purchased this for business use and to replace my laptop that's conking out. This will not do it. This is NOT a replacement for a regular computer. This is fine for vacation travel to keep up with email or watch a movie, maybe for a student or one of those people who sits in coffee houses taking up a table for hours on end, shopping, Face-Booking, or whatever it is they do. It's a nice portable size, has a good-sized screen, you can make a phone call on it (pretty cool), and the best feature I think is, the battery lasts around 8 hours. I'd like to say I love this thing, but when I'm just looking to play a game, check my email, do a quick search, read a book, watch a movie in bed, or find a recipe, I still go for my tablet. I can see this quickly becoming another unused dust-collector in my home.\n\nSo to sum it up: This lacks many attributes and capabilities of a regular computer, and is not as convenient nor has the good selection of apps (or touch screen) that a tablet/Android has. It's fine for web-surfing and email, but if you rely heavily on your computer for work, file storage, and just life in general as I do, then this probably won't be for you.\n\nFollowing are some excerpts I found on howstuffworks.com. Hopefully this will be helpful:\n\n\"Google embraced the concept of an ultra-simple, Web-centric OS in large part due to the huge recent success of netbooks. Netbooks are small laptop computers that are designed to let users access the Web, and not much more; they're inexpensive and feature-limited hardware, and they aren't built for high-powered applications like Photoshop, for example.\n\nUnlike Windows, Chrome won't be available as a download. It'll be pre-installed by netbook manufacturers who adhere to Google's hardware specifications. Chrome is designed to run best on solid-state storage systems as opposed to traditional spinning hard drives, in part because solid-state drives are less prone to failure, but also because they're less spacious -- remember, Google wants you to store your data online. And because the OS uses Web-based applications, you don't need local storage for software, either.\n\nIt's no accident that Google stresses the online aspects of Chrome. The entire Chrome project revolves around the cloud computing model. That fancy term simply means that all of your data and applications are stored online, in the \"cloud,\" so that you can access them from any computer, anywhere.\"\n\n\"It's important to remember that Google doesn't intend for Chrome OS to be your primary computer's operating system. Instead, the company sees a Chrome OS netbook as a secondary computer that you use once you're done with the heavy-duty applications you use on a more powerful office computer.\"\n\nUPDATE:\nStill trying to use this Chromebook (pretty sure I'm finished with it now and will give it to my nephew to play with) but am finding more cons. First being, the touch pad doesn't automatically turn off when you plug in a mouse, which I prefer to use, and while typing, I'm constantly hitting it making the cursor move. Supposedly there is a way to temporarily disable it manually, (got this from a forum: \"CTRL+ALT+T and then at the crosh prompt enter: tpcontrol set 129 0\") but it didn't work for me, and I tried it several times. Even if it had worked, I would have to do this every time I turn on the chromebook.\n\nSecond problem I have is that, the drop-down menu font is REALLY tiny, and there's no way to adjust it, even though you can adjust the size of the whole screen.\n\nAnother thing that's extremely annoying also has to do with font-size. I use Outlook for email, and I use 12pt font, for writing emails. No matter how many times I have set it to 12pt (and I've been doing it in  Outlook settings, not just the compose screen), it immediately reverts back to 8pt. I've tried resetting it and then rebooting--still will not stick at 12pt. The problem is not with Outlook. This does not happen with my old PC, my tablet, my iphone, or the computer at my work--ONLY with the Chromebook! I have been all over the internet looking for a solution to this problem, and nobody seems to have one."}

Not a fan of Microsoft and Apple's bloated products and prices, I really wanted to like this. For browsing online it's amazingly fast. Even with multiple windows open and videos playing, etc, there does not ever seem to be any slowing down. But as far as pros, that's about the only thing I have. I am actually quite blown away by how little usefulness I will get from this machine. Various sites with product descriptions of it had boasted 1000s of apps available. Let me tell you people, this is NOT true at least from what I have experienced. After learning the ropes of the new OS I went immediately into the chrome web store where I had been directed by all of the support and orientation pages to find apps that work on chromebook. I started in the \"recommended for you\" but quickly found that 9 out of 10 of the apps I tried to add were \"not supported\" by my device. I ultimately ended up calling google support in bewilderment thinking that I couldn't possibly be in the right place to get apps. I learned that I was in the ONLY place to get apps and that there was many that would only work on windows and androids but NOT chromebook. So, I can get these apps on my samsung phone but not google's very own product?? I also learned that there is no way to limit the search to those apps that actually work on chromebook and that the only way I might be able to tell is by reading through the reviews to see if someone has mentioned it. Since the phone call I have tried another dozen apps and only ONE of them worked. I can hope that this will change some day and google will add some things to make chromebooks more usable but I have to say that they seriously let me down here. If 99% of what you do on a computer is through a browser, on facebook and video sites, than this is the computer for you. Anyone else may end up hugely disappointed."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "Where to begin! A few months ago I was looking at the chromebooks. I decided that I really like them. But I did not want to spend 250 or more on one. They were still fairly new when I was looking and I usually like to look into electronics before I just purchase one. I went home and did some research. I wasn't sure if I really wanted one yet. I am so glad that I waited. About a week ago I got a deals reminder on my kindle fire. It said for a limited time I could get the Acer C720 Chromebook for only 59.00!! I got really excited and decided that I would get it. I mean who can beat $59.00?! I got it two days later, delivered to me. As a windows user, I had a hard time at first. Trying to use the chromebook. It only took me about a day or two to get used to the chromebook. IT has been amazing so far! The battery life is great, as long as you keep your brightness at about half or less. If you do that you can make it last an easy 7 or 8 hours. Mine is currently at 48% and I have been running it since about 9 this morning, (7 hours ago) I don't have any complaints about it yet. The one thing that may bother some people is that everything is ran right out of chrome. I haven't seen yet where you can just pull up a window of a program and run it separately. I also love that I can use the google docs, it is very easy to use on here. I have been a chrome lover since I started using it a few years ago. I have already done work items on it as well and it is so quick and easy. The start up time from when you turn it off is literally 7-10 seconds, may even be quicker. Other than that, for the deal that I got, I have no complaints! IT is perfect for me (:"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I have always been skeptical about the chromebook generally and that's because I'm a Windows fan. I have always refused to appreciate any other OS. Lately however, I was forced at school to use the only available computer which happened to be a Mac. Now don't get me wrong, I do love MacBooks, I only HATE (yeah, spelled in capital letters!) the cost price. Yes people talk about the security, the this, the that, but why why why on earth will I spend over $1000 on a laptop? Why I ask again? Maybe if I wasn't a student I wouldn't be asking.\n\nAnyway, I got this chromebook for $59 (and no it wasn't stolen!, lol). I got it during a kindle fire special deal. Which brings me to another topic: if you don't have a kindle fire get one ASAP, even if you don't need it! I assure you, you will get your money's worth in a few months from the special offers alone. Back to the chromebook: as already explained by multiple reviewers, the chromebook is a web-based operating system that does EVERYTHING through the browser....even games. Now, just like windows 8 you have apps you can install from the chrome webstore (e.g dropbox, pandora, netflix, youtube, bible, evernote, google drive, and even instagram). You also get a free 2-year 100GB google drive storage. The chromebook comes with a flash player so you can watch web videos if you want to. The device battery gets charged in less than two hours and lasts approx. 7-8 hours with heavy use. The device itself is very light, small and very fast. I opened up more than 10 tabs, was streaming music to my wireless headphone from youtube via bluetooth and was drawing chemical structures on reaxys all at the same time and the chromebook didn't even notice. I read somewhere that you cannot draw chemical structures on reaxys and scifinder on a chromebook, well that's a big lie. You can choose the GGA Ketcher structure editor on reaxys and it draws just fine, and scifinder works excellent too. Furthermore, for programs you can't install on the chromebook you can remotely access a windows computer that already has the programs installed using the chrome remote desktop app and it works fine. I have heard people complain that the remote desktop works slowly but that wouldn't be the case if they remembered to change the windows computer theme to the basic windows theme. I remotely accessed topspin and chemdraw on my windows desktop at home from school and it works fine and fast. Oh and yes, it comes with google sheets and slides etc, the whole thing you need to type and make presentations. The google apps are basically the microsoft office equivalent because they look just like microsoft word and excel and powerpoint and even work like them for the most part.\n\nSo in conclusion what am I trying to say? If my windows 8 laptop was very fast, very light, very small and didn't interrupt me with updates every now and then because of security issues, maybe I would always carry it around. But even if a MacBook had all of these and much more, I wouldn't buy it because all Apple stuff, though are good, are always too pricey. Oh and get a Kindle fire! Amazon gives awesome deals every once in a while. Good luck!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "First, I purchased the Acer Chromebook fully understanding what I was getting. A Chromebook is not a laptop killer or desktop replacement.\n\nA Chromebook is essentially an internet dependent laptop that starts up super-fast, integrates seemlesly with Google products and Chrome extensions, very portable, and extremely affordable. It is a better execution of the old netbooks that went out of style a few years ago. Chromebooks are not for loading 3rd party software, playing hard core games, or even using native Microsoft products. A Chromebook is what you use when youy just want to play around on the web, push out a few Google Sheets, and talk to family using Google Hangouts. Did I mention that Chromebooks don't play well with native Microsoft apps like Skype?\n\nBut what it does do is give me a fast machine that allows me to do 90% of what I used my full function laptop to do. I still have a desktop that i use for photo editing, managing my music and video files, and playing the occassional game. But for surfing the web, sending email, and other things that I can do on a phone or tablet but would rather have a larger screen and keyboard - the Acer Chromebook does for me.\n\nAt 2.75 lbs and .75\" thick, the Acer is an affordable beast for quick work on the web. It does everything for me that I need. The keyboard is rock solid. Mouse pad is sensitive and works as well as a full function laptop.\n\nIt took me less than five minutes to set up including adding a Google Cloud Printer. The toolbar icons make it simple to do everything I want.\n\nI highly recommend the the Acrer C720 as any Chromebook over $250 should make the buyer think twice about if they should just get a full function laptop instead."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "Before giving my review I want to introduce myself.. my name is Justin and I am a newly enrolled student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and this laptop has literally been a tremendous asset in my summer school classes at UNC.\n\nSo let me tell you first why I bought this laptop and also give you a brief history of my laptop experiences. For two years I owned a huge 17 in. hp pavillion laptop that had seen way better days. Going into the latter part of my senior year I knew I wanted my next computer to be a gaming laptop, and for people who don't know much about gaming laptops.. those things aren't portable... I had been so used to carrying my huge HP pavilion though that I believed the task to be manageable. Now fast forward to summer school I have my new gaming laptop the MSI Dominator in a beautiful 17 in screen display and weighing over 10 lbs. my plan was to leave the MSI in my dorm and use my old HP for classes. I wasn't used to carrying my HP around with me and walking around all day with a 8 pound laptop on your back is not fun!! Not to mention the stares everyone would give me every time I pulled that big old tank out of my bag while they're all typing on their new Macbook pros and Lenovas. After a week I knew I needed something else because this was not going to work for my remaining 5 weeks in summer school or in the fall. I began my search by looking at the Windows Surface computers and long story short after numerous YouTube videos and amazon reviews and budget concerns I decided to go with the Acer.\n\nI could not be happier with this laptop. This bad boy is so light, and it last all day and some allowing me to pull it out in classes without worrying about the charge. I can go a whole day of work, and watch about an hour of netflix/youtube and work some more and only charge this thing before bed everyday. My only gripe with the computer is the keyboard. One problem I have with it is the size, after a day of typing on it my arms begin to hurt and cramp because of the small size, but I don't know if that is just something I have a problem with because I am so used to larger computers. Another gripe I have is that there is no caps lock button! When i first noticed it I didn't think it would be a big deal but after a couple of days I realized how much I miss the caps lock button.. but it isn't a deal breaker.\n\nTo conclude this device is a great secondary computer.. I couldn't imagine this being my primary machine, but for taking notes in class and doing work on the go this machine is magnificent, and the reliance on the internet it has doesn't bother me at all because everywhere I go on campus I'm covered. So if you're someone who enjoys the portability of a tablet, but wants the features of a computer then I highly recommend the laptop. (BTW I do have an office 365 account, but I primarily use docs for my quick notes in English, and switch over to my main computer for typing papers or just use office online)"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I bought this laptop for my wife so she can use for work. She does work for the business we own. Her job is managing social media marketing campaigns for our clients. She was using a desktop computer that just was not very efficient for what she needs to do and wants to do. We have 2 girls that she also spends most of her day taking care of so she needs to be able to move around and setup and work anywhere. Because of this she also needs a machine that doesn't need to be charged all the time.\n\nI purchased this laptop intent on installing Linux on it. My initial thought was to purchase a decent laptop that is 4 or 5 years old because she isn't going to use it for much more than the internet, email and light office work. After doing a research on a bunch of older laptops I realized that none of them will be able to hold a charge that long and they just aren't going to be very efficient. I went to Fry's and asked the sales people if they have any display models or clearance laptops but all they had were Chromebooks and at the time I was dead set against getting one. I didn't want to have to buy something that I had to spend a lot of time tweaking to get just right. Unfortunately all they had were Chromebooks and the cheapest one they had was the Acer C710 for $199. So, I decided I would keep looking online. I researched installing Linux on a Chromebook and realized that with the newer models this was a lot easier to do. So I went to Amazon and found that the newest Acer model the C720 was only $199 (the same price as the older C710 on clearance at Fry's) plus I had a $50 Amazon card that I got for Christmas. So I purchased the Acer C720 with 2GB of RAM and a 16GB hard drive for $149 +tax. It was the best decision I have ever made.\n\nAfter it arrived at my house I turned it on and logged into Chrome OS for 5 minutes before I started to install Linux. She was not able to do what she needed to very efficiently with Chrome OS either. You can only be logged into one Google user session at a time and she regularly logs into 3 or more to do what she needs to. If she were to do that using Chrome OS, she would need to logout and login to each one, each time, which is a huge time suck.\n\nI initially installed it using the ChrUbuntu dual boot method but this was just not what I was looking for. So, I read some more tutorials and figured out how to get it to single boot straight into a custom OS and I installed Xubuntu 14.04 on it. After a bit of configuration and tweaking, I got the trackpad working (better than it did in Chrome OS), I got standby operational, I configured the function buttons at the top of the keyboard and configured the machine to connect to her old desktop for extra storage space as well as daily backups. My wife is a photographer as well and this computer just doesn't have the space for storing the tens of thousands of photos she has generated over the last 12 years. The hard drive space is not an issue as long as it is configured to use a remote drive for storage. I also installed Remote Desktop software and configured it so she could open a remote session to her windows computer for running programs that only run on windows.\n\nI was a little concerned at first because of the 2GB of RAM and the 1.4 GHz CPU even though I had heard really good things about the Haswell processors. Naturally, the machine flies in Chrome OS but I thought I would compromise speed and energy efficiency by installing Linux but I was completely wrong. She has not had any issues with speed. She regularly has at least 3 or more chrome sessions open at the same time, each with 5+ tabs and she has not once complained about lag or the battery dying fast. She also does photo editing and uses Skype on a regular basis without any issues.\n\nI recommend this machine to anyone looking for a new affordable lightweight laptop. No matter if your looking for something streamlined for internet/email only or a fully functional laptop, this will work. Chrome OS is great for the average user who doesn't need more that a portal to the internet but if you are looking to do more, such as Skyping, photo editing/managing, graphic design and/or any sort development than I recommend installing Xubuntu or your favorite flavor of Linux. Linux has hundreds of open source desktop applications available, free of charge, for completing almost any task.\n\nOh yah, she also can work on this thing continually for at least 5 hours before needing a charge. That's when she is running multiple chrome sessions as well as photo management tools and Skype."}

You can get online to any website you want.  You have google docs, google sheets and google slides to use (in place of the microsoft products)  It comes with 100 GB of storage on google drive for 2 years.\n\nYou can use this Chromebook offline, but it depends on the app you want to use.\n\nThere is no dvd drive.\n\nThere are SD  USB, HDMI  slots and headphone jacks.\n\nSuper easy to set up.\n\nGood little computer that is easy to use (would be great for those who are not really computer literate and only want something they can check email or facebook or the like on)  Wish I would've know that when my grandma was looking for a new computer."}

SOOOO glad I did. I LOVE this thing. It's so great to have all your Google apps connected. It has Google docs on it, which functions just like Office w/o the cost, and everything is automatically saved because it's all online instead of on the hard drive. It saves as .gdoc, but can be easily downloaded to the computer as .docx for easy sharing. It's a wonderful hybrid of a tablet and computer. The best part is that everything is automatically connected through Google, so if you're like me and have your phone and tablet and entire life attached to your Google account it makes everything super convenient; made a calendar event and BAM there it is on my iPhone. I'd rather have this + my kindle Paperwhite any day than an iPad. Also, the \"Hangouts\" app is basically Skype or Facetime but WAY better. I think everyone should have one of these. I HIGHLY recommend this over a laptop or a tablet."}

I moved from an IBM Lenovo to the Chromebook C720 and have not had any issues with compatibility in my spreadsheets or documents. I am not a power user, nor do I perform much photo editing.  The keyboard is comfortable however I had to acclimate to the single touchpad with no left/right buttons. I purchased a usb mouse and it has been a great accessory when I actually do want to edit a photo or do excessive cut and paste work.  The Chromebook boots in less than 7 seconds and I have yet to experience a lag in performance.  Considering the price, the fact that it does not need to be upgraded to keep up with new apps, and all my work is kept in the cloud and can be accessed by me by anywhere, this is the perfect machine for me."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I was going back and forth on if I should rate this to be 2 stars or 3.  Ultimately I decided on two, because the standard price is $199.  For that price, it completely is not worth it.  I was fortunate enough to buy the Chromebook for $59 on a Kindle Fire flash sale.  For that price, it's alright.  I wouldn't pay more than $65.\n\nPROS:\n* Super fast start up\n* Easy set up\n* Easy web browsing\n* Portable\n\nCONS:\n* Keyboard layout with the spaced out keys causes a lot of typos. The backspace button is just a bit off, so I can't correct the typos quickly\n\n* No Yahoo Instant Messenging.  I knew I wouldn't be able to run traditional Windows or programs, but I definitely thought that I would be able to download YIM since this computer touts itself to be a web-based system.\n\n*  No video Skype.  While it does have Google Hangouts, no one I know has Google Hangouts to call.\n\n* Difficult to right click.  You have to press the touchpad with two fingers exactly right to get it to right click.\n\n* Apps are always opened in a browser.  I finally did find an app (IM+) that ran YIM and Skype.  However, it has to be opened up in a browser window.  I can't move the chat windows around the whole screen like I normally do, nor chat from the desktop.\n\n*  Printer set up is confusing.  I won't even bother trying to print directly from the Chromebook.\n\n*  Chromebook's Google Documents aren't as user friendly as Microsoft, Wordperfect, or similar word document programs.\n\nAll in all, for $59, I'm glad I got it.  It is easier than the Kindle Fire to browse the net when I go to a hotel.  However, I would never pay $199 for this device.  I'd rather get a second hand laptop for that price, or better yet, pay the extra $100 and find an actual laptop on sale.  I never thought I'd say this, but even Windows 8 is better than the Chromebook.  It's a real disappointment too, as I have wanted to try a Chromebook for a long time.  I had much higher hopes."}

It takes barely any time to turn off or on, set up is fast and easy (I didn't even need to use an instruction manual), the keyboard is a nice level, there's an SD slot, and the little touch pad is quite nice. Camera is low quality, but it's there.\n\nThe only problems I've had with my computer is that it makes a high pitched noise, and I have no idea why. Most people probably wouldn't be able to hear it, but I have sensitive ears.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I've been saving for this Chromebook for a few months and was almost there... Then, a special offer popped up selling the exact one I've been pining over for $59!\n\nWith the savings, I opted for one day shipping to get it here before I have to go out of town and fortunately, it arrived tonight just in time.\n\nSet up was super fast, sign into wifi, sign into Google and ready to go. I was online within about 2 minutes of opening the box.\n\nThis Chromebook is mainly for writing screen plays, transcriptions and internet surfing. I found a screen play writing app that works with software on my other machines, tested and so far it works great. I've tested google docs and same thing, works great.\n\nThe keyboard is a perfect size, keys are all in familiar places for me. I type 90 wpm so the ability to type fast was also crucial.\n\nThe track pad is very easy. It doesn't have separate buttons for right and left clicking, but you just press the bottom right or bottom left of the track pad for the same effect. I've already done highlighting, cutting and pasting with it with no problems at all.\n\nI'm looking forward to working in \"the cloud\" so clients can get transcripts as they are in progress.\n\nI've had this running for 3 hours now and it still says I have 6 hours left of battery time. It's sitting on my lap as I type this review and is not running hot at all.\n\nI've also tested videos, so far all have worked just fine. Netflix required a setting change in chrome plugins that was very simple and works great.\n\nI thought this was a great value at $200 - $59 is just phenomenal! I'll be purchasing another one for my daughter soon.\n\nI am now a Chromebook convert.....\n\nQuick update: I was typing a document and went to hit the Caps Lock key only to find it's been replaced by the google search key - which is a great shortcut but I do need caps lock for documents. However, I found the way to activate caps lock is by pressing the alt and search keys at the same time or you can go into \"settings\" and assign CAPS lock to the search key.\n\nFor right and left clicking, press Alt and the right or left bottom corner of the touch pad until you hear the \"click\".\n\nEdited again: A week later and I'm continually impressed. I just installed the remote desktop feature and now I can access my desktop, use the software that I don't have access to with the chromebook and work without compromising the speed of the chromebook while editing sound files, video, pictures and scripts while saving them all to the cloud. No more moving files around on flash drives or making clients wait until I get home to retrieve files. The productivity of this chromebook is endless.\n\nUpdate 8/16/14\n\nI use this every day and have not been let down yet. I was concerned about being able to play quicktime videos for transcribing and was relieved to find a a free app for transcribing that embeds the video in the word processor that works better than any paid software I've used!\n\nI still haven't found a decent audio editor, but with the remote desktop connection I can still access my main computer from anywhere and use the editor in that (as long as I remember to leave it on.)\n\nOn top of all of the functionality of this chromebook is the added bonus of not having to worry about viruses. Yesterday an ad on a webpage automatically redirected to \"java update\" which I normally just close out of, however this time it automatically downloaded before I could shut it down. On a windows machine I would be in a mad panic to get to the file before it installed itself and held my system hostage. With the chromebook, no worries. I just deleted it from the download folder and that was that.\n\nStill no overheating and it stays cool to the touch on my lap even while typing in 90 degree heat. I can't hear a fan at all so I don't know how it does this. I spent 12 hours working on a screenplay with no freezing, no overheating, no computer related distractions at all. Since it's done in the cloud, every word is automatically saved as soon as it's typed. Writers will get how important this is. There's nothing like spending hours writing only to have your software freeze or glitch to elicit a string of curse words you've never heard before and frenzy to try to recover your lost work. Even if this chromebook were to crash and burn, I can still access all of my work just by logging into Google and opening the Chrome browser from any computer and it's right there.\n\nIf you're worried about security and having everything in the cloud, Google has a wonderful security feature that you can get through changing your security settings where every device has to be verified through a code that is sent via text to your cell phone. So, if someone gets your password and tries to login from their own device - unless they have your cell too, they're not getting in."}

This is a 200 dollar netbook pretending to be an ultrabook.  The remote desktop is amazingly fast, and usually gets ~10fps on local wifi and ~3-4 fps over the internet.  It works with proxies and vpns, the solid state memory is user upgrade-able, the battery lasts around 7 hours as long as you aren't watching videos, the screen is perfect for watching a movie by yourself or with another person, and everything just works.  There was a hiccup where the firmware on my television was causing problems with the HDMI outputting 720p instead of 1080p, but it seems to have been patched out.  The touchpad is very responsive, and scrolling with 2 fingers is an entirely different experience than side-of-the-touchpad scrolling with a laptop, I'm still not sure why they make laptops with that anymore.\n\nI've also used the linux dual-boot / crouton-shared-kernel boots and while I much prefer the legacy-bios dual-boot option, they were both functional and extremely easy to install.  You put it into developer mode, type about a line of code, and wait for it to do its thing (around 30 minutes).\n\nWould I rather have an ultrabook? Of course, but I'd much rather have 800 bucks and this than an ultrabook.  Plus the price helps mitigate any fears I have leaving it in a car or in a backpack while I'm at the gym or something.\n\nThe 2gb of ram haven't been an issue, and if it becomes one, just close a couple tabs.\n\n10/10, would buy again."}

The keyboard has a great setup as well.\n\nI use this also with my Chromecast and the two work seamlessly together.  Not a bad setup for under $300."}

I have three other laptops (Windows) and two of them are outdated and slow.  So, I was looking for a travel laptop that would allow me to surf the web without being an armload on the road.  I have used Chrome for quite some time now and had little problem going the Chromebook route.  This laptop gives you the web in mere seconds without all the delays that seem to be a part of the MS World.  No virus...no constant update notifications.  Nothing but super fast internet access.  This machine was built to access the web.  The display is fine and the touchpad is responsive.  But you can't load MS programs...who cares?  It doesn't have a DVD...who cares?  If you use it for the purpose it was created, it will be the best $200 you have invested in a long, long time.  Many of the poor reviews indicate that the buyer didn't read the specs before buying.  That's the buyer's fault, not the laptop's.  Will this do everything that a high-powered PC or Mac will do?  No.  But that's not its purpose. It's light, fast and allows you to browse anywhere Wi-Fi is available. If that is the laptop that you need, then this little guy from Acer is your Best Choice!"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "My first encounter with this device started badly. As I was learning to use it,  the display suddenly became very dull and washed out. Strangely colored bars would sometimes cross the screen. Very distracting. I posted a question on the \"ask a question list\" (above the reviews on the product description page) asking if others had the same problem. The answer was a resounding NO. So I asked Amazon to replace it. They rapidly complied, and two days later I had a new model. Very painless exchange. Thank you Amazon.\n\nNow, on with the review. First of all this is not a windows PC, and that is clearly stated in the product description. It may take a windows PC user a little while to come to terms with this operating system. At first it may seem restrictive, but as you get to know this thing you may come to admire it, as I have done. It is pretty much an Internet based device. Without an internet connection it is barely functional, although it can still do some useful things.\n\nAs a web surfing device it really shines. It brings up web sites much faster than my $600.00 Acer laptop. In this computer I was mainly looking for very portable web surfer to take on trips. With this guy I really hit the jackpot. Battery life is excellent. I got nearly 10 hours out of it one day. It's very light and the keyboard is great. But what's really amazing is the touch pad. It is very responsive.  you can move the cursor around the screen with one finger, and scroll the screen up or down, left or right with two fingers. I bought an HP blue ray mouse at Walmart, which works fine, but I rarely use it now because the touch pad is so good.\n\nIt doesn't have a lot of internal storage, but unlike many tablets, it works well with flash drives. That gives you an almost unlimited amount of storage (you can stuff a lot of them in your pockets). You do get some free storage on Google drive and that's helpful, but I have found that Google drive makes for a very convenient file transfer device, linking my PCs, and iPhone to the Chromebook. So that's what I mainly use it for. Very handy.\n\nI have no trouble playing my MP3 music on the Chromebook (I have about 40GB worth on a flash drive), As far as videos, I can get it play both MP4s and Quicktime videos from my iPhone, but it can't handle the AVCHD format that my Panasonic Camera produces. However, I use a free video converter (Win FX) to convert them to MP4s and those work very well.\n\nThere is much about the Chromebook that I have yet to discover, but the more I learn, the more I like this thing. It is a refreshing change from a Windows PC with its constant nagging and neediness. The best testimonial is that my computer challenged wife took to this thing right away. I'm impressed.\n\nMy only real complaint is the display quality. It's pretty good but not nearly as good as my more expensive Acer laptop. Maybe my expensive Acer spoiled me. That's the only reason for the 4 stars. If you haven't seen a really good display you would probably think this one is just fine.\n\nAll together there is much to like about the Chromebook, especially for the price. I would buy this product again and, actually, I may just buy another for no apparent reason. Pretty darn good job Google.\n\nFinally, thanks to everybody who answered my question about the display, and a special thanks to Amazon for providing that capability and for getting me a replacement so quickly."}

I ordered the Acer C720 and planned on getting back into writing, it has a slightly higher learning curve than does a laptop or computer, I think this is due to the fact that I have been using computers for over 10 years.  I am very pleased with it and don't even mind not having a mouse to help navigate the screens.\nThe only drawback, that I can see, is that it tells me I can save to the cloud, my chromebook or a flashdrive but does not tell me how.  I understand there are apps for that, but after looking at the apps, which one do I choose?\nI am pleased with this product and wished I had not waited so long to plunge into the Chromebook arena."}

I can't say I've really had many issues with it other than connecting to the wifi at work (just ordered a USB Ethernet adapter to see if I can at least get connected that way).  Doesn't have issues anywhere else with wifi, just in the office. It's super light weight so I carry it almost everywhere I go and the battery lasts a long time.  Google docs and spreadsheet work well for most of my daily needs, although i do hope google continues to improve on them because some features I use often are missing.  App store is easy to use.  Wish there were more apps but hopefully all in good time.  Only thing I can say about apps that I do not like is with game apps in particular (i don't play games all that often so it's not a huge deal).  I have found that a lot of them don't allow you to turn the sound on the game off and I can't just mute the sound all together on the chromebook because I only play games while watching a movie or tv show so I need the sound on.  So most of my games I still play on my phone.\n\nFor extra storage so I don't have to save everything to a cloud I have a 64GB tiny flash drive I keep plugged in almost all the time.

When I learned that the new wave was coming out this summer, I decided to give it to my wife and by the new 13\" model. Unfortunately for me, this would cost me a little time since I did not have the funds ready to go. I started idly looking into netbooks and chromebooks just to mess around, and came upon reviews of the C720. I was blown away by all of the great things people had said about this little beast.\n\nCut to yesterday. My wife and I are out of town, we both have papers due on the same day, and only 1 computer between us! Oh no! I head straight to Wal Mart hoping I could find this little gem for the same price as Amazon had it ($199), and there it was! I picked it up thinking I would return it after I finished my paper if it wasn't worth the money. But WOW! was it worth it! This machine performs much better than a $200 computer should. I was worried about it being limited offline, but there are plenty of apps to go around offline. It even has a torrent program which has made my life so much easier when I'm away from home and need to get large files in quickly. It moves fast and is ridiculously responsive. With the brightness turned all the way up, it looks just as good as the MB Air (same resolution). The battery takes a while to die. It has an HDMI port. A USB 2.0 AND 3.0! It works with a wireless mouse out of the box. Wow. This thing is just perfect for what I needed! I even installed Linux on it and played a few games just to mess around and was very impressed.

I use it more than the MacAir (11in.) or Dell desktop. The person whom I ordered it for as a gift uses it every single day and it has not hiccupped once, not once. The only thing that has \"broken\" is a small piece of plastic on the hinge cracked and broke off. It has not interfered with the opening and closing of the screen. It is one of the best tech purchases I have made. I now understand why Chromebooks are beginning to catch on. No need to buy expensive laptops, tablets or desktops if all you want to do is surf web, check email, watch movies, etc. Yet, I do much more than that. Coding HTML (using the Carat app), editing photos, using Google Drive for storage and creating docs, spreadsheets, slideshows, drawings, etc. Chromebooks are remarkable devices. Google needs to continue developing them.\n\nPurchased the Chromebook Acer C720 as a birthday present for someone who is not a Geek. They've been very happy with it. What you get for the price is very good. Very quick response when surfing the net on home DSL wireless. Very light and easily taken wherever you go throughout the house and outdoors on the porch. Google has simplified the mechanics and process to streamline its performance. Keyboard is good with a nice tactile response. Camera and sound are good as is the battery life --- so far. Three days of fairly regular usage before needing to be charged. Screen size and quality is good for its price range. Screen quality could be better for this user but for $200 I can't complain.\nFor surfing the net, sending email etc it has been a good purchase, so far. I need to see how well the battery, keyboard, and camera hold up over the long term. Much cheaper than an iPad, Samsung tablet etc if all you want to do is get on the net and get going. There are more Apps coming out that can run offline from the Google Store -- remember for most use, no internet, no programs but that is changing.

I researched the Web and also Amazon for information about apps and overall performance.  Amazon's details specified, and I quote \"run your favorite Google apps or access your photos, videos, music and documents from anywhere\".  This is not true, the Google music app, book app are not supported in the Central America country where I live.  I cannot get photos to import from an SD disk.  Also, Google and especially Google Chrome do not play nice with our internet system.  I love the size, the portability and the lightening fast start up.  BUT, IF YOU WANT IT TO RUN EFFICIENTLY, REMAIN WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES OF THE UNITED STATES.  I, therefore, am returning my Acer Chromebook."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "So let's talk about the Acer c720 chromebook. This is a small 11.6 inch netbook style laptop which runs chrome OS on a intel based haswell processor with 2 GB of ram and a 16 GB internall ssd for storage. It boots in the promised 7 seconds and I've yet to see it slow down during heavy use. The chrome app market is still young but there are already a lot of applications which make this more than \"just a browser\". The keyboard is shallow for my taste but the layout and overall tactile feel is good. I was concerned about the hinges having seen this design with larger laptops and it more often than not is the first hardware piece to fail. I was pleased to find that the hinge was tight and sturdy, this and the lightweight design of the laptop lead me to believe this hinge will last the lifetime of the device. Battery life under use has been the best part, 9-10 hours easily. Screen brightness has a nice range and is acceptable for anything from indirect sunlight to full dark rooms. For those concerned with getting bored of the operating system on this device it's worth noting that this device is well supported by several popular Linux distributions. For the price it is a no brainer even if you only buy it as a travel or spare laptop. Portability of a tablet with the stability of an integrated keyboard and google cloud at your fingertips."}

I was going to use this as my \"writing\" laptop...just to write articles and jewelry how-tos.

Switching from my desktop keyboard to this one takes a little bit of thinking every time.\n\nSecond post,\nWith the help of learning the shortcut keys I'm getting used to the keyboard.  For the money its a great buy; however, I can't get it to sink with my desktop Outlook 2007 I need to upgrade and then it might work.  I was just going to buy Outlook 2014 version because I don't use the other programs like Word except a few times a year now; however, I learned if you don't buy the suite you lose the ability for grammar checking in Outlook because the grammar checking is located in Word 2014.  Disappointed for now.  I'm hoping I find a solution.  I would like to have Outlook as a calendar base that will travel to Google or some online calendar that I can also get to from the Chromebook.

After using them for over six months, I deem the basic model is already more than sufficient for my daily use, with about 15 tabs in the Chrome browser.\n\nThe Haswell architecture Celeron CPU is both capable and power-efficient. The basic configuration Chromebook C720 with 2Gb RAM and 16 GB SSD can run fast-action 720p HD video (example: Youtube video of squash or badminton sports), even in full-screen mode, without any performance issue. Scrolling through complex web pages (example: arstechnica.com, theverge.com) is also never a problem. These observations are made in the presence of 20 browser tabs.\n\nThe C720 cold boots to the login screen in 8 seconds.\n\nIt has a HDMI port for easy connection to a larger monitor or flat-screen TV. Other ports included are USB 2.0X1, USB 3.0X1, 3.5mm audio/microphone combo, SD card reader, and Kensington lock.\n\nFor $200, this is the best Chromebook, even the best notebook value that you can buy. It is only about 1/4 to 1/5 the cost of an Apple Macbook Air 11-inch. It is more versatile than a tablet and only costs at least half as much."}

The Acer C720 seems to fit the bill just right.\nI have only had it a very short time, but I can see why Chromebooks are being used more and more folks around the world. Considering so much of what we do every day on our computers exists online and in streaming format (netflix, facebook, twitter, online shopping) there isn't need for every computer in the house to be able to edit and store a ton of photos and games and music (though with the minimal storage built into the C720 you have room for at least some of what you would like to have close at hand).\nI needed a backup laptop to head to work and school with me, and this fits nicely into my bag. To keep it from getting scratched I'm going to get a little laptop sleeve for it. I think its body could withstand a few tumbles and tosses, though.\nHope you found this review helpful, feel free to leave a comment if you have any questions! :)"}

I open it up and log on to the internet in under 10 seconds.  Updates by Google are automatic and in the background, no annoying windows popping up telling you about \"updates.\"\n\nThe battery lasts over 8 hours with hard use.  I watch videos from Amazon Prime on this machine with no problems, I just hook up my Apple iHome speakers and the sound is great. The Amazon Kindle Cloud Reader app was included on this machine also, and it works flawlessly.  I also listen to Pandora for hours while doing work at home.\n\nI started looking at the Chromebooks after taking an online class called Intro to Google Apps. I selected the Acer because it was the least expensive.  I already used Google Drive to back up my home and work files.  I have decided to use Google docs in the future since I can use my Chromebook to access them with ease.\n\nI think that Cloud Computing is the future, and this Chromebook is perfect for the \"Cloud.\"  I've owned the Acer for about a month and it has become my go to laptop for work and play. How can you go wrong for $199?"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I received my chromebook recently and I am just as satisfied as many of the other reviews.  I'll start off with the few items that are less than awesome.  The keyboard is ok, the keys are a little flimsy and I would have liked if there was some beveling.  The screen, although bright and good resolution, has problems when viewed at angles and not straight on. Another quirk I wish there was fast user switching but to switch to another user you have to sign out and the other user signs in.  Surely it is like this so that a latent user profile doesn't eat system resources, but fast user switching would be a nice option.\n\nNow everything else about this machine is everything you could hope for @$199.  I have many documents and pictures already with Google and once I signed in with my account they were all there.  It copied my chrome extensions from my desktop to the Chromebook once I signed in so configuration was almost non-existent.\n\nIt can play every type of web content I've tried; even streaming with the Plex app works wonderfully.  I was surprised at how loud the speakers get, if you have it at max you have to be deaf.  The wifi reception works well.  I can access 5 GHz networks with better signal strength then my phone.\n\nI got this for light weight option to use the internet around the house and while traveling.  This will definitely fulfill all those demands and it feels fairly sturdy and I think it should be durable enough to carry around.  Also it's nice that it plays all web content since my wife routinely complains about websites not loading on her iPad and from the first day she grabbed this and the content loaded correctly.  Hooray!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I bought the Acer C720 to have something lighter to carry around. I have a Dell Windows laptop that's has incredible specs; however, I don't find myself ever using it to its maximum capabilities. So why should I drag around 6.5 lbs with me all day? The Acer C720 is incredibly light and it's much thinner than it appears in the pictures. The build is very nice for a $199 laptop. It uses a sturdy matte colored plastic which I actually find rather attractive. It doesn't look toy-like.\n\nThe screen is something that many people have complained about but I find it perfectly satisfactory. The resolution is good enough for the size of the screen and it's plenty bright to be used in sunlight especially since it's a matte display. The keyboard is nicely spaced and the keys feel okay at best. The keys are very shallow which I don't particularly like but I can understand why they had to do that. It takes a little bit of time to get used to but after a day's use, the keyboard should feel fine. My WPM fell about 10 from my average 85-90 WPM on a desktop keyboard but after several days, I'm starting to get back up to that range. The trackpad is really nice. It has a nice smooth texture and it's responsive. I don't know what some of the other review have been saying about it being loose. Mine is definitely sturdy. It does make a loud click but if you turn on \"tap to click\" you'll only actually have to make a loud click when you have to grab and drag something.\n\nI bought this laptop to primarily use out and about for work so it was very important for me to have it open my PDFs. I put my PDF files on the 16gb hard drive and they open right up with the Chrome PDF viewer. Perfect! All of my documents, music, and photos were already in the Google cloud so as soon as I turned the laptop on, everything was ready to be viewed.\n\nThe battery is rather amazing as well considering how light this laptop is. The machine came with no power. Once I plugged it in, it took just over an hour to charge. On my first charge, I've managed to get just under 9 hours! Wow! My usage was pretty light though. Primarily opening up books, reading news, typing two emails, and watching a couple of youtube videos. Still, that's an awesome battery life.\n\nIn terms of Chrome OS, I think it has a perfect balance between simplicity and functionality. Sure, it can't run Photoshop or autoCAD, but I think the majority of people don't use those programs. I, personally, don't need anything more than what Chrome OS offers. If you really need some kind of editing tool, the Chrome Store has replacement apps that can get the job done. You just have to look for those apps or just Google search for them.\n\nSpeed on this little guy is incredible! I can't believe that a $199 machine can work this quickly. Pages load up almost instantly and that includes videos. In terms of browser performance, the Acer beats my Windows laptop (which has a Core i7, 8gb ram, and a SSD). I don't know how Google accomplished this but it's truly incredible. I think the 4gb model is overkill. This 2gb model has not slowed on me. I use a max of about 10 tabs. The laptop never lags or skips a beat with that many open. I personally don't use more than that at any one time; however, I've heard that this thing can handle up to 20 tabs without slowing down. I can't imagine how many you'd need to open for the 4gb model to slow down.\n\nIn general, this is a 5 star machine. If you're looking for a productivity machine that can entertain you during breaks, then look no further. This is the one!"}

I have a wifi-enabled printer, it should be so easy to connect to it, but for some reason they make you jump through all kinds of hoops in order to print from a Chromebook. Baffling. I guess they made cloudprint to make you even more dependant on Google's propriety cloud software. Ok, rant over - other than these issues it is still a very good product."}

I got this because I am becoming a full time missionary and need to keep in contact with my friends and family while I am across the world. lol It does everything else I need it to. Its really light weight and easy to carry around.\n\nIt was a little difficult to start using the webcam, but once I got it connected to wifi it was a no brainier.\n\nI gave it a 4 star only because you have to do the go around to use skype. Now Google does offer a different way of doing video calling, and I'm not to sure about this because I think your friends and family need to have a google account to be able to use this. Apparently if you install the plug in with an outlook email address you can use skype but I haven't completely figured this out yet either.\n\nLike I said I just purchased this laptop yesterday and got it mostly figured out but not everything. Its pretty self explanitory and they do a great job having a step by step way of setting this up. the manual is also on the computer itself so no extra paperwork in the box.\n\nIf you have any questions feel free to ask.

Do some research on Crouton.  It will allow you to run Ubuntu simultaneously with Chrome OS, which greatly improves what you can do with this machine online and offline.  Once you have Ubuntu running, you can install Skype...and it does work!

I returned that since it lagged terribly streaming videos, and was just too flimsy. Then I thought I'd try a chromebook, being apprehensive about the OS. I have since come to love this notebook. In fact, I was sold on the set up, before I even got to the desktop. I opened the lid and it immediately asked for the password to my WIFI, and within seconds, I was up and running. It's light and fast and at $200, it beats all expectations. The web based word processor and spreadsheet are plenty sufficient for my needs. It still lags when streaming HBOGO, but I can cast it to my TV via the Chromecast with no issues (well, other than the fact that if you navigate away from the page you're on, you lose the controls, or I haven't figured out how to get them back yet.)

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "When my last laptop wouldn't power up anymore, I started looking for a new one. The only thing my laptop has been used for in the past couple years is letting my daughter watch youtube videos or play games on PBS's web site. I also occasionally surf the web and maybe once in a while do a video chat/Skype.\n\nWith those requirements in mind, I wanted to get the cheapest laptop I could find. I am not a big Windows 8 fan (my now-dead laptop was running Linux) and of course Macs are too expensive, so I started looking at Chromebooks. To be honest this was the cheapest one I could find with decent reviews, and at only $199 I thought I'd give it a try.\n\nI'm pretty impressed with ChromeOS as a whole. It boots very quickly, and this C720 has a good battery life (4 or 5 hours with youtube watching). The screen quality isn't the best but the resolution is acceptable. As you would expect, pretty much everything is based around Chrome and it all works pretty well.\n\nOne thing that is a downside of ChromeOS and not this particular product is that since everything revolves around Chrome, any Chrome extensions you install have the opportunity to mess the system up pretty good. After a couple weeks of really poor performance after installing (and uninstalling) some extensions, I did a system restore (which was very easy/fast from the menu). After that, I just didn't install any extensions and it has been working great ever since.\n\nThe device is really light and easy to carry around. It doesn't feel exceptionally sturdy.. I'm not sure how many drops it will survive.\n\nSure I'd like it to be a little bit faster, have a higher resolution, more RAM, etc. But for the price point, this really is an amazing product."}

The screen could be brighter, but it's bright enough that I can use it outdoors without any trouble.  It will sit in standby for a week or two before dropping below 20%.\n\nMy only knock against it is that you have to log back into your Google account after every shut down. (At least I haven't found a way around this.)  That's annoying for those of us who use long, random, secure passwords."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "Used this at a friend's place for about a week when I was staying with them before I decided to buy it. I was undecided whether to go for the C720 or the C720P- the touchscreen option but eventually opted to go with what I had tried and tested. Got it less than 24 hours ago.\n\nWe already have a Macbook Air, Macbook Pro and an iMac at home. I got the Chromebook for myself- passing on the Air to the kids.\n\nVery happy with my choice. Can do everything I do with the Air except one (coming to it soon). I browse the net, open and save all MS Office files- Word, Excel, Powerpoint. Just downloaded the 3 Office applications from the Chrome Store- haven't tried them out as yet. Even if that doesn't work out the Google options are pretty good.\n\nI can browse any website, save files locally and print (via Google Cloud Print). I am an Android user (Nexus 5) and most of the features available on the Chromebook either supplement or complement what I already had on the phone. Some of them are given below:\n\nGoogle+ Photos: My photos from my phone are already automatically backed up to Google+. Photos from our iMac (main repository of photographs) are also automatically to Google+. The Google+ Photo app in the Chromebook just enhances the experience of browsing those photographs though one could also look at it in the Chrome browser in Google+\n\nGoogle Cloud Print: I can easily print from the phone and the Chromebook does the same. I have a HP 3510 and it connects to the printer via HP ePrint.\n\nEvernote: I use the Evernote for web. Works very well, in fact is faster than the desktop application in the Mac. Doesn't work offline though. I also use the Chrome browser extension for Evernote to add notes and clip web pages very well. Another alternative could be Keep (from Google).\n\nGoogle Drive: works just like the phone. Accessible even offline. And with the 100GB of storage for 2 years it is a great plus. If you do end up using the 100 GB, even after 2 years if you don't want to pay for it- it should still work- you just won't be able to save more files above the free (15GB) limit but be able to access all the existing files in the Drive.\n\nHangouts: works with the Chrome browser extension or within Google+.\n\nSpeed is excellent. The battery life is just out of the world. It is like a camel in the desert without water- it can go on and on and on.\n\nWhat's my biggest gripe? Skype. I use it pretty often and it is the choice of most when it comes to video calling, across the world. The alternative offered is Hangout video calling. But as a medium of communication this is still to catch on and this is the most restrictive feature of the Chromebook. Akin to Skype Out, Hangouts also provides the facility to call phones and mobiles by buying credit- works across the world and not only specific countries (the purchasing of the credit).\n\nOf course the requirement of being on line for most of the tasks is also restrictive but then that is a given and known when you buy the Chromebook.\n\nTwo other products which I have figured out are not available but might be high use apps are Spotify and Picasa. The latter is surprising considering it is from Google, but I think the objective is to push everyone onto Google+ Photos.\n\nSound is excellent. Has a small bass and is more than adequate.\n\nOverall- this (and any Chromebook) can not be your primary PC/laptop. But is a must get for easy access, browsing and great battery life. Would be a great gift and also great entry level notebook for kids."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "Yes, yes, yes. $200 well spent, no regrets. This basically fits all my needs. When I announced I had bought a chromebook a few of my friends were disgusted. One said that \"all it does is run the internet\" and another said \"they break in no time\". To the second guy, I'm assuming he was talking about earlier chromebooks which I heard broke very easily. Everything I heard about this one before buying it said that it was much sturdier and did not break easily. To the first guy, I said well, that's all I really need.\n\nI really needed a new laptop and as a high school student my priority was speed, lightweight, thinness, efficiency, and for it to look nice. So I started looking into chromebooks and decided that this pretty much met those needs. I'm not really a hardcore gamer, and if I really need to play computer games there's always other laptops in my home to use. I love google chrome and chrome applications for their simplicity and ease. This gave me all that without other distractions. No need to worry about antivirus, no constant update reminders, no snail-pace start up, no overheating. Just so convenient. Obviously there are drawbacks of not being able to do all that you might be able to do with a traditional laptop but I'm willing to look past that. With my high school/artist's budget I don't really expect to make much and so don't really expect to be getting some high tech piece of machinery that works to perfection.\n\nThe only problem I personally face is that my WiFi connection can be pretty s***ty, but that's not the chromebook's fault. Really, if my WiFi was out while I was on my old laptop I would pretty much have nothing to do except wait for it to come back. So why waste 300 extra bucks on something over priced and over large that I won't even use when I could have this for a much better price? Another thing I had to get accustomed to was the small size. I was expecting something a bit larger and I felt a little disappointed initially when I saw it, but I got over it pretty fast. Now when I use my old laptop or another \"regular\" laptop, it feels ridiculously large and awkward. This computer takes everything I need and gets rid of everything unnecessary and makes my life so much simpler. DEFINITELY recommend it to anyone who's primary concern with a laptop is the internet. 5/5 for me, thank you so much Google."}

Then I found out that it makes a fast wireless connection to the Chrome Cast on my TV from any website.  That wasn't the case with my Windows laptops that only made a fast connection with the Chrome Cast from websites that were already set up for Chrome Cast.

It just can't connect are a regular basis, especially when the battery is under 80%. I have laptops, cell phones, consoles, and PCs that all do fine on this network  but the Acer C720 just can't compete with those. While the other devices are connected and surfing properly, this machine will drop the connection a lot. Occasionally it will have a nice little run and not drop connection for a day, but that is a rarity.\n\nBTW: I've dealt with Customer Service (both ACER CS and a internet forums for Chrome, google, and general hardware) and haven't had much luck getting it fixed.

From dead battery to full charge is only 60 to 90 minutes. I would recommend this laptop to anyone as a second machine and a first machine to many. Do a little research. Make sure to get the Celeron processor. It flies. Enjoy surfing."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "Yes, there are a few tasks I need a different operating system to complete, but overall I can do pretty much all common computer tasks fine with this Chromebook. With vim and ShiftEdit, I even do a good chunk of Web development with this computer. I still take video editing and rom tinkering elsewhere, but this little guy is great for just about everything else I've thrown at it. The built-in terminal works fine, and there's enough storage space for transferring materials around. Certain tasks are still a little rough around the edges (working with zip files could be smoother, for example), but overall, I'm more surprised by what I CAN do on the Chromebook, rather than the other way around. If you are the \"tech support\" family member and need to suggest a consumer laptop for a less technical family member, the Chromebook could be a godsend for you and for them. You'll need to convert Microsoft Office use to Google Drive use (works fine for me, but I don't really created sophisticated layouts. Chrome's Excel replacement is really quite good now, with much better formula options), but other than that, I think most computer users would be foolish not to consider Chromebooks. The price alone makes them worth a look and with Haswell in them the battery life is great. A few things to keep in mind: wifi must be reliable, new users need to be patient and develop easy (but possibly different) workflows, you may need to search a bit for extensions in the Chrome store to replace a few Windows/OSX functionality, and it may be easier to buy a newer printer for use with Google print if you need to print a lot. I'm quite pleased with this machine and I would not be surprised if ChromeOS ends up as a new Windows in terms of widespread use. With its cloud-first leaning and the ease with which users can switch computers (even to other operating systems with the Chrome browser installed), it's really a great choice for mobile workers. It also really lends itself to use in schools, so the next generation will be well-versed in its functionality and well-aware of its budget-friendliness... a great take-to-college machine for students on a budget."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "This Chromebook's software is very fast and smooth. The device is light and quite thin. However, Chromebooks still have a lot of features missing. Printer support is where I encountered a serious lack of functionality. If you have an Android phone, you can send your print jobs to it, as Android has good driver support from printer manufacturers.\nTrying to access your printer directly via Google Cloud Print is useless, unless you have a Windows computer running all the time, with a printer attached to it.\n\nAnother problem that I encountered was finding a good calculator program. Chrome OS has a very basic calculator, but if you want to calculate anything more than basic math, then you either have to get a full-blown scientific calculator from the Chrome Web Store, or calculators that are really buggy. Very frustrating, as all I needed to do was calculate percentages.\n\nOne final issue that I had, was that I had to use my Google account password as the device password. That required me to dumb down my password, so I could remember it. Normally I have a password manager create a complicated password and then sign in to my Google account using the manager. Why Google choose this method when Android allows you to create a device password is a mystery to me. Apparently, Google thinks you will only be accessing their services on a Chromebook!\n\nWhen it comes to using Google services and accessing the web, this Chromebook really shines. Do not purchase a Chromebook if you need a full desktop system! That being said, I am happy with my purchase. I bought a refurbished model, and I have had no trouble with it at all. Acer designs a great Chromebook."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "This is a nice, inexpensive piece of hardware. I got one used from an Amazon vendor.\n\nAfter running ChomeOS on it for over a month finally installed Fedora Linux 20 with the stock Gnome desktop. Although my model (C720-2802) only has 2G (of non-upgradable) RAM, Fedora with Gnome 3 fits nicely. Did upgrade the shipping 16G SSD to 64G using a part from another Amazon vendor. That leaves plenty of room for installing additional apps and almost 20G of space for files. Now I can use my Chromebook to makes calls over Skype! But seriously, if you're comfortable experimenting with computer hardware and not afraid of open source you're going to love this model. There are tons of blog posts and technical wiki articles on the Internet explaining how to turn this into a really useful machine. The only wrinkle is that my unit has a hardware issue in common with some of these 2G models: it shuts down without warning. While there's no official word on what causes this, the fact that those able to return them under warranty get a new unit indicates it is probably a manufacturing problem (I checked and CPU temp is well within normal limits). All of the other explanations (pointing the finger at ChromeOS) are really hogwash. Hopefully some day the secret will come out. Until then I'd recommend to anyone who has this problem immediately return their unit for a replacement while it's still under warranty. One more thing, for your own sanity remap the power button so it sends a suspend command (it's just too easy to hit it by mistake when going for the backspace key)."}

No, you cannot install software of any sort but with all the app options, why would you?

I wasn't expecting much more than that, but I that was all I needed at the time being. I soon found out that this little Chromebook could do much more than that.\n\nOn my old computer I would download music from online (hip hop mixtapes mostly, which aren't always available through iTunes or Google Play) and then upload it to my Google Music account, so I can access the music anywhere. To upload music on WIndows 8 you need an actual program downloaded from Google. I assumed that since Chromebook doesn't support traditional programs that I would no longer be able to download or upload to the cloud. However, after downloading an album that came as a .zip file, I found that there are browser-based unZIP software, as well as programs to download torrent files, and you can upload music via the browser.\n\nThis thing is great.

It's fast and reliable, incredibly lightweight and fairly easy to use. I recommend it highly as a portable second computer for a moderately tech-savvy person. I wouldn't recommend it to someone as an only computer or to someone who isn't comfortable occasionally googling around to figure out a problem.\n\nMy biggest complaints are not reasons to avoid purchasing this Chromebook, but things I'd wish I'd known prior to my purchase. While the apps available through the Google Play store are overall very helpful, switching between non-Google file types can be tricky. Mostly for me that's dealing with Windows documents, such as .docx. I've also had some trouble with media files, especially video and sound, that I'm still trying to sort out. Streaming works well, but opening previously downloaded files is not so simple.\n\nThe biggest criticism I've encountered in about a month of ownership is just how flimsy the hardware is. It's something a few reviews mentioned, but it didn't really jump out at me until I got my own. About two weeks after I bought my Chromebook, my medium-sized dog bumped it off the table and stepped on the (closed) Chromebook. It booted up and works absolutely fine, but the upper-left hand corner of the screen is a grey block and there's a weird green line running down the screen. I would definitely recommend buying the purchase protection plan for this laptop. I am filing a claim with my credit card in hopes it'll be covered.\n\nI might be slightly biased because my ASUS K50 is an absolute tank and has weathered a lot more damage in 6 years of ownership. It also weighs 6 times as much, which is why I upgraded to the Chromebook.\n\nStill, I like this machine a lot and I'd buy it again.

Before you read this entire review you need to know that this is a Chromebook. If you already know what a Chromebook is then go to the next paragraph. Chromebooks can't run .exe files like a PC or a Mac can. It does most things in the Chrome browser. So if I wanted to play Cut The Rope, I would go on the Chrome Web Store, \"download\" it, and it's, \"installed.\" Then, when I want to play Cut The Rope, I press the Cut The Rope button and it opens up Google Chrome on a certain webpage where you can play Cut The Rope. So If you wanted to play Minecraft, you shouldn't get a Chromebook because Minecraft and pretty much anything that you need to download (like Microsoft Word or Spotify) is probably a .exe file. But you can still do a lot of stuff on a Chromebook. Google Docs lets you edit documents and you get 100 GB of Google Drive storage on Google's servers, or \"The Cloud, \" to edit and store your documents. Also, Microsoft has Word Online which lets you, well, use Microsoft Word and store it in \"The Cloud,\" except you store it on Onedrive instead of Google Drive, unless you download it onto the Acer C720's 16 GB solid state drive.

Also has an SD card slot.\n\nScreen:11.6,\" LCD, 1366 x 768, 135.09 ppi\n\nConnectivity: HDMI, two USB 3.0 ports, Bluetooth 4.0, and Wifi.\n\nBattery: I couldn't Google the MaH in the battery, but it lasts about 7.5 - 8 hours.\n\nOk, so after I wrote all that I just noticed Amazon has the specs right on it, so you can also look at that if you want.\n\nNow, for the actual laptop on the outside. Even though it only has a pixel density of 135 ppi (pixels per inch, 135 is terrible), it still works and shows me what's on the screen. Unless I'm not looking at it. The speakers work great, and if you plug in headphones it automatically adjusts it so it doesn't scream in my ears. And when I take them out, it makes the speakers loud again, so I can still hear it from about a foot away. It's really thin and light, I can carry it with one hand under it while it's turned on easily. The battery life on this is amazing, it's one of my favorite parts of the C720. Lastly, the processor on the C720 is decent. It's fast enough for a laptop, and great for a $200 laptop.\n\nIn conclusion, this is a good laptop. If you like video games, a nice screen, or anything that you need to download, then I'm wondering why you would be reading this review in the first place. But if you like battery life, a good price, and a decent computer, then I think you should click the, \"add to cart\" button!"}

The most significant positive feature that struck me about this Acer C720 was its remarkable time usage. I knew it was long as reviews that I read stated but it was even more impressed. I remember my first morning I woke up (very early start as Hawaii time zone was three hours behind PT), turned on my C720 at 4 AM and used it until 2 PM. So after eight hours I actually looked to see how much battery life it had left - hadn't even dipped below 30% yet!"}

Don't be fooled by the Celeron name or the lower 1.4 ghz clock speed.  I had 4 1080p yt videos going before it started to stutter, and that may have been my connection as much as anything. With the Samsung I'd be lucky to get one 720p video running smoothly.  It's not the sexiest laptop out there, but its a lot thinner than I expected, and it doesn't have the big ugly hinge like the Samsung.\n\nI bought this as a temp unit to get me through to the Bay Trail or Core i3 Chromebooks, then I was planning on giving it to my mom.  However, I think I may just keep this and get her one as well.  It's plenty fast."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "Is the concept of cloud-computing something for you? Let's see...\n\nSince receiving the Acer Chromebook C720-2848 several days ago, I've come away with a brand new perspective on the Chrome operating system. Here's my take on it and why, if your needs aren't completely dependent on Windows, this may be just the right call for you.\n\nFirst, what is a Chromebook? It is a laptop with its own system that relies on everything Google, and runs the operating system \"Chrome OS\".  Chrome OS does not allow for \"programs\" to be run in the manner that Windows or Mac does. It is almost fully browser-dependent (but not to the extreme that you can't use the computer without an internet connection). You run \"programs\" in the Chrome browser, and they run quickly and efficiently, with hardly any hesitation. Unlike that of Windows' program launching, Chrome OS is nearly immediate and glorious in its ability to do your bidding.\n\nThe first thing you will note about the system is that it boots in under 7 seconds so that you can come from a cold start to having logged-in and ready for work or play. I am used to having my Windows 7 installation tweaked for high performance, but the Chrome OS needs no help there.  A few things before I really get into it should be noted:\n\nThere is no firewall to configure; no need for virus protection; system is automatically updated without bother, and has an SSD (solid state drive for virtually noiseless computing), and can run up to 8 to 9 hours on one charge.  The OS requires no license validation and can be re-installed quickly if need be. Sounds intriguing? Stick around and hold on to your wig because this thing will flip it!\n\nThis particular model is the C720-2848, at $200, a revamping of the older C710.  The Intel Celeron Haswell architecture brain that runs it is quite faster than the prior model, C710's Celeron brain, and comes with either 2GB of DDR3 ram or, for more handling power, 4GB, for $50 more. It appears for most users that is over-kill, as most won't have more that 10 to 12 windows running at the same time. My model is capable of having several Youtube videos playing, and several other windows open, with no adverse hit in performance. Should you choose to try a Chromebook, don't pick the older model, regardless of sales discount inducement.\n\nWhen you boot into your Chromebook you are met with a desktop, similar to a Windows PC, but there are no icons on the desktop. Instead, there is a sidebar where you chose which program you wish to use. You want to surf, you click the Chrome icon, and you are quickly sent off to the internet. There is also an apps icon that you click in order to see all of your applications that are available to you. These applications can be downloaded (downloaded here means: the shortcut to the application that will play in the Chrome browser) from the Chrome Store. You can build quite an impressive amount of useful apps for work or play and delete them (getting rid of the shortcut to the application) as you see fit. An example of a utility app is Screencastify, a screen video recorder that can record all you do with or without sound. You can also capture video with the webcam. Snagit, from Techsmith, is another useful app for screen recording or snapping shots of anything that you want on any page you go to.  Another useful application is Clearly, an app that rids pages of all extraneous litter, leaving only text so that you can read or save it.  There is a growing lineup of games that can be played via the browser as well, one of which is still popular, Angry Birds. You won't be able to play more demanding games, but this is not a gaming computer. As more and more users Skype now than ever before, Chromebook users are not as fortunate. But you can use Google Hangout for calls and video chatting. All sorts of utility apps and more are populating the Chrome Store, so this is just the beginning of what may turn out to be a most welcome and fast-growing app market for your Chromebook.\n\nThe Chromebook can not accept printers via usb (remember: you can't install programs), but you can wirelessly print via Google Cloud Print to your printer as long as you have a printer that is capable of cloud printing. Nearly all printers for just under $100 have this feature today.\n\nTyping on the keyboard was an unexpected pleasure, as I have never been able to type comfortably with any laptop I've ever used. The touch pad is responsive and utilizes the familiar one finger mouse move, and two and three finger gestures, the latter being for scrolling back and forth through the open windows. You can plug in a usb or wireless mouse and keyboard, but you probably won't need to.\n\nAs for music play, the speakers for a low-cost computer as this sound great.  There's appreciable loudness with hardly any noticeable shrill at very 80% volume. The is some slight bass, not heavy and shouldn't be expected on this laptop.  The bluetooth works with newer versions and is backwards compatible with bluetooth 2.0 and up.\n\nFor light users of Microsoft Office, Google Docs takes over the job. It will read, write and edit the documents. Just don't expect it to be on par with its very expensive brotheren.\n\nThis model comes with 16 GB (there is a 32 GB SSD --Solid State Drive-- version available) of drive storage and can be supplemented with Google Drive cloud storage (free) for additional storage. You can also slip in an SD card up to 64 GB for .PDF files, documents of all extensions, movies, pictures and music.\n\nAs for entertainment, Youtube and Netflix is clear and never stutters. Watching movies one SD card on the matte-finish 11.5 \" screen is better than expected for such a low priced laptop. No complaints here.\n\nThere's an HDMI out port and one USB 3.0 and one USB 2.0 port, headphone/mic input.\n\nAt just 2.7 lbs, this laptop is not cumbersome and stays very cool even after hours of play. I am writing this document on it and I feel quite comfortable doing it. I can't say that about any laptop I've used in the past. I've seen the best of laptops come my way for repair, and not once was I enthralled by the keyboard.  I love this keyboard!\n\nWhen you are not connected to the internet, you can still enjoy your Chromebook to some extent.  You can still write documents, read and write email (for sending later), play one of many free games, read a book or just settle in for a good old movie.  It isn't as crippled as Microsoft's damning commercial makes it out to be, is it?\n\nThe question now, is: Is this for you? If you aren't a lover of Google's self-contained system and are really dependent on specialized programs, then you probably won't find much to like about it. But if you are all things Google and have no need for heavy, specialized programs like Photoshop, or intensive music production software, heavy 3-D gaming and the total Microsoft Office experience, welcome to the next thing in computing!\n\nBy Eddie T"}

I even find it comfortable for watching Netflix and Hulu+ and the like. Plus, it only weighs like two and a half pounds so it's really comfortable to use anywhere, even in bed.\nNearly silent operation: You can barely hear the fans on this thing when the room is quiet. Much more pleasant than my old laptop which would rev up like a jet engine as soon as you hit the power button.\nStays cool: Even when I set it on top of my blankets in bed, it doesn't get warm at all. The fans ventilate very well. It helps that this is a low power device I'm sure.\nComfortable keyboard and trackpad: I was surprised how comfortable the keyboard is on this. I thought I was going to have to learn to adjust to a smaller keyboard, but the keys are sized and spaced well that anyone would feel comfortable typing on it. And the track pad is nice and large as well. The touchpad is also great. Very functional and responsive. I like that the whole pad clicks.\nChromeOS: I'd never used ChromeOS before now, but I think I really like it now. It's perfect for casual computing. Lightweight and fast. Chrome is already my preferred web browser on the rest of my devices, so I couldn't go wrong.\nSurprisingly versatile: When I bought this I figured I would be using it for online shopping and browsing the web and not much else. Now I find I use it to manage documents and spreadsheets through the browser based versions of Word and Excel, manage files on my Google Drive, use AirDroid to manage my phone, and even use Chrome Remote Desktop to control my desktop.\n\nCons:\nThere's not much I don't like here. I don't like that the power button is kind of incorporated into the keyboard. I haven't accidently pressed it yet, but I'm nervous I might. Also, I wish they would've put a caps lock key instead of the search key. I never use the search key and would much prefer to have a caps lock key. Also, I don't know for sure but I don't think the device ever completely powers down. When I try to clean it, it always comes back on whenever I touch the track pad or sometimes (I think) other keys. A little annoying for cleaning.\n\nConlcusion:\nThis was one of the best purchases I've made in a while. I use this all the time and it's definitely a great value for the price. And I was lucky to be able to get mine refurbished for $150. Buy this. You're going to love this thing."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "Think about it.  Lightning fast processor in a computer that does 95% of what I use a computer for.  There is ONE Windows only program that I have to use for work, so I still have to have a Windows machine around for that.  I use my Mac at home for photo editing but I'm experimenting with the web based solutions in Chrome, which get better and better each day.\n\nI have a 27\" IPS monitor for my Mac Mini with a DVI input (Mac) and an HDMI input (Chromebook).  I connect the Chromebook with the HDMI, I connect a bluetooth mouse and keyboard, shut the lid on the Chromebook (that automatically puts it into \"docking\" mode, so it runs with the cover closed.  Cover closed shuts off the built in screen, so the battery life more than doubles- no need to plug it in when I dock), I tuck the Chromebook away alongside the monitor, and I have a complete desktop computer system that takes up little space on my desk. And no slouch.  The graphics are identical to that which my i7 Mac Mini puts out (1920 x 1080).  1080p YouTube videos no issue.  1080p videos play back from an SD card, no problem.  Haswell processor is lightning fast- instant response.  Web pages load and open faster than on the Mini (ad block pro extension is key).  The audio can play through the monitor via HDMI (if it has speakers, mine does not) or through the Chromebook's speakers.  The Chromebook's speakers are outstanding for a laptop, the best I have heard on a laptop ANYWHERE CLOSE to this price point.  Speakers fire both downwards against the desk surface, and also up through the keyboard.  You can not tell where the sound is coming from, it just sounds great.\n\nSo, $199 for Chromebook, $275 (or less) for a monitor, $50 for keyboard and mouse, around $500 for a top line, lightning fast desktop replacement.  Add a USB3 external drive or USB3 stick and I have local storage, though the Chromebook comes with 2 years of Google Drive storage.  Now, when I leave the house, I grab the Chromebook and take it with me.  Small, very light, packed inside my $9 Amazon Basics neoprene sleeve.\n\nBest of all, since it's Google connected, if you enable Google Sync, if you need to wipe it clean and start fresh (aka, Powerwash), as soon as you log in to your Google account, all of your apps, desktop, configurations etc automatically and practically instantly download, so your machine is back where you had it.  Nothing to re-install, nothing to re-configure, etc.  If your files are stored at Google Drive or Dropbox, they all automatically show back up, nothing was lost.  This is the future of computing.  Resistance is futile.\nHere are the two bummers:\n\n1.  I can not figure out how to get IMAP mail working on it.  My Android phone and tablet (with limited local storage) have IMAP mail, why not my Chromebook?  I use IMAP for work e-mail and Gmail.  It could be configured to only download the most recent emails to not take up space on the SSD.  Choose to save certain messages and attachments locally, etc. that I may need later or offline.  I need a standalone IMAP client for it, or the Gmail offline client needs to include IMAP. If I had that, I could almost get rid of my Mac.\n2.  The built-in screen's resolution could be better.  I am spoiled by my 27\" IPS screen, I want that contrast and brightness on my Chromebook as well. Yes, I can spend more on a \"better\" Chromebook and get a better screen, I know.\n\nHere's a Top Tip for people who already own a Chromebook or are buying one.  This unit comes with 2GB of RAM which is fine, but if you open a lot of webpages or watch huge videos it might bog a little.  Chrome OS runs on Linux, and in Linux there's something called zRam.  zRam creates a RAM swap file on your hard drive, 1.5 times the size of your physical RAM.  Since the hard drive in the Chromebook is an SSD, data moves between RAM and that swapfile instantly.  Once you enable zRam, it will add a 3GB RAM swap file on your SSD, so now your 2GB RAM Chromebook effectively has 5GB of RAM, instantly and for free.  It is a persistent change- it stays there even after you reboot.\n\nHere's how:\n\n1.  Hit ctrl-alt-T, a browser window opens with a message about Crosh, the Chrome OS developer shell, followed by a command prompt (\"crosh>\")\n2.  Type \"swap enable\" (no quotes) and hit enter.  Crosh confirms that you've created a swap file that will be active when you re-boot.\n3.  Re-boot, and enjoy your free RAM upgrade.  w00t."}

With Crouton running a copy of Ubuntu, you've got a very wide selection of games off of Steam, emulators, and other programs, and still retain all the simplicity of ChromeOS with a simple keystroke combination.  It's technically possible to just wipe ChromeOS out completely and turn it into a simple $200 Linux notebook, which it's certainly effective as, too!\n\nEven without installing Crouton and things like that, the default ChromeOS is still plenty useful and has a lot of options, especially with the included Google Drive storage.\n\nJust be aware that without Internet access, there's not much a default Chromebook is capable of doing."}

Networks being what they were, I shuddered to think of the lag they'd experience when all the teachers tried to access their accounts simultaneously, and how everything would come to a screeching halt the moment the district servers went down.\n\nMy, how recent developments have changed my opinion.\n\nThis was purchased to replace a poorly aging Windows XP laptop which my kids used for schoolwork.  It's fantastic.  I've always been wary of anything that won't let me save anything I want locally, but the development and steady improvement of cloud services has done a lot to alleviate that concern and the kids, who've grown up with mobile devices that have limited storage space, have no qualms with apps that both reside and save their data to Google drive.  It's not a desktop replacement, it's not a home entertainment/gaming system, and it won't allow you to hack into  WOPR to play a game of global thermonuclear war, but it'll let you write a report, email it to your mom to be proofread, video chat with said mom to go over the finer nuances of grammar, print it to a networked printer, save it to Google Drive, email it to your teacher, and then settle in for some well-deserved time on Club Penguin."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "Last week I bought a refurb unit direct from Acer ($150) and the unit arrived today. I bought this for my dad since he's a senior and the old Windows Vista is getting to be a real pain for him to work with. I originally purchased a Samsung Chromebook (when it was first introduced) for him but found out the printing mechanism wasn't quite there. So I've been using this Acer Chromebook tonight and it's simply a joy to use!\n\nMy setup with the unit is paired with my Google CloudPrint enabled printer, Epson WorkForce 845. Set up was easy enough. Since this unit is for my dad, I'm going to get him a low-end Epson Expression XP-410. It's only $69 on Amazon and it's a steal! One thing my dad does with his current printer is using it to scan documents and feed directly to his email. I don't think the Epson does it automatically but as a workaround, he could scan the doc onto a SD card or thumb drive, then un-mount it and stick it in the Chromebook. Not as direct but the process is quite straight forward. It shouldn't be a problem for him, albeit he's 83. :-) Go dad!!\n\nI also tested the VPN connection and it works flawlessly. I have a VPN service so I could watch BBC programs via the iPlayer. Previously I've been using my Nexus 7 and hooking that up to my TV via a SlimPort connection. It's a bit of a pain but using the Chromebook, the process is much more reliable. Bluetooth works as expected. I'm very happy with how far Chromebook has come, therefore I'll be getting my own unit next week! I was planning on getting the 32GB unit but decided not to since I ordered a 64GB SSD replacement. It's only $50+ and I think it's worth it. Was thinking about the 128GB but since I'll be utilizing Google Drive (with a free 100GB for 2 years); I think 64GB is plenty; at least for now.\n\nWhat needs to improve? Not so much the hardware but I wish the OS has the ability to save web pages on the Shelf, or in a folder or some sort. There's a workaround on doing that but the process isn't as simple. Certain keys are missing from a traditional keyboard standpoint, but I'll adjust. If you miss your Function Keys, there's a way that you can set up your keyboard to toggle them back. It feels a bit 'odd' not being able to save anything on the 'desktop'. It's different and I think I'm going to like it, a lot!\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nUPDATE: I just read about where the Epson Connect website has an option where you could scan directly to your Google Drive. Su-weeet!"}

For the price and how functional it is, probably one of the best electronic's purchases I've ever made.  I have found a small handful of sites that don't like chrome but it's a very small handful.  Updates from google have fixed most of minor annoyances I found when I first started using it (calculator was not intuitive to use but is now).\n\nIt's pretty durable too.  I've dropped it once or twice, my toddler has knocked it off the coffee table (hard wood floors), my infant likes to bang on the keys.  No problems encountered.\n\nThe powerwash feature (a factory reset function) is pretty handy too.  Since I store nearly nothing on the machine itself, I can powerwash it every month or so as a security measure.  When I recreate my google account on the machine, all the previously installed apps come back automatically.  Handy.\n\nSmall gripe about apps, the offering isn't as wide as I would have expected.  Many android apps are not available for chrome; that was a small surprise.\n\nI would buy it again.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a travel/browsing machine.  Half the price of my wife's phone and so much more useful on the go.\n\n********\n\nI'm typing this review on my chromebook.  I love it.  It's featherlight (well not really but it's very light), it's compact and it's fast.  I was worried about keyboard size as I'm a pretty big guy (6'3\") and have big hands but it feels just fine to me.  Best things about it are the boot up time (it really is about 7 seconds, 3 if it's just waking up from sleep) and the battery life which can stretch all day if I'm only using it for 30 minutes at a time here and there.  I think I last charged this last night and 24 hours later, I still have 60% left since I only used it twice this morning.\n\nIt's not a full laptop so if you get it to do productivity things (spreadsheets and documents) you probably won't like it.  But if you want something to travel with that will do everything you need without leaving a huge dent in your wallet if something happens to it, this is the machine.

I wanted something that I would almost only use for quick online tasks or surfing while watching TV.  This really fits the bill.  The start up time with the solid state drive and Chrome OS is sensational.  I used to be apprehensive to use a computer for any quick, menial tasks, but now I just reach from my Acer.  There are some items that take some getting use to.\n\nI have run into issues with Citrix because my company doesn't have the latest and greatest that comes with the HTML5 version.  The Chrome OS seems to lack some basic settings that I would like to be able to change.  For example, the Acer will turn on whenever you lift the screen.  It makes sense to do so, but it did take me some time to get used to it when I was just looking to clean the screen or keyboard.  And finally, as I am sure you know, the Chrome OS doesn't have the ability to install programs outside of the Chrome browser.  I knew this going in, but there have been a few times that I wish the OS could at least run very simple programs in an emulated environment.\n\nThe Acer C720 looks stylish and isn't very flashy.  The keyboard feels a bit cheap compared to any other I have used, but you get what you paid for.  I was actually surprised to find a full-sized HDMI port that easily allows the computer to display on an external display like a monitor or HDTV.  I have actually used that feature more than any other, but having two USB ports that are on EITHER side of the computer is also great.\n\nIt's exciting to use Chrome OS and the Acer C720.  Google releases new updates to Chrome OS regularly that bring new features and abilities and more and more developers are creating apps that are specific to the OS."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "For almost four and a half years, I've been using an Acer Aspire One netbook running Windows XP, so it would have been nearly impossible to get a new computer that DOESN'T run better, faster, longer, and quieter.\n\nThings I like:\n-this thing cost over $100 less than my old netbook, has a bigger screen, and is lighter and thinner\n-using 3 fingers on the trackpad to switch between tabs\n-although there's no dedicated monitor on/off button, you can turn the screen brightness down to the point of the screen going black\n-it boots up so fast I barely notice a difference between it turning on and it coming out of sleep mode\n-I've actually used every key on the keyboard\n-I can pick it up by one corner and I don't hear a cracking sound\n-Edit: I kind of broke the trackpad early on because I tried to press down to right-click on something and after that the right edge of the trackpad didn't work. A few months later, as described below, the computer had a bad fall. Lo and behold, the trackpad is fully functional again.\n\nThings I don't like:\n-there's no Delete key which I had gotten into the habit of using a lot when my old netbook's backspace key started becoming unreliable, instead there's \"alt+backspace\" and the power button is where the Delete key used to be on my netbook so I've almost put the computer into sleep mode a couple times\n-there's no number pad, not even a \"fn +\" number pad like on my old netbook\n-when the fan does turn on, it tends to turn on for like one second, cool down enough to turn off, and repeat every two seconds for a while, but I'm pretty sure that's not terribly abnormal for a laptop. It's not loud, it's just annoying when it keeps turning on and off.\n\nThings I am ambivalent towards and simply have to get used to:\n-I have turned this thing on like once since I got it because it turns itself on/wakes itself up every time you open the lid if it possibly can. That includes the very first time you plug it in which startled me a little.\n-there's not much available in terms of customization/options for stuff like when it sleeps/turns off the monitor, but there's not much I've felt the need to change in the first place\n-the keyboard labels are in all lowercase\n-I can't use the NotScripts chrome extension because I can't get into the program files to set the password, but seeing as the Chrome OS is supposed to be nearly immune to viruses I probably don't need to worry\n-there are no function keys, but the only ones I used were for refreshing and fullscreen, and there are keys for those\n-the caps lock key was replaced with a \"Search\" key but one of the customization options they do give you is the ability to change it back to a caps lock key so naturally I switched it right back\n-when I press the keys, they don't go down very far so I kept feeling like the keystroke couldn't possibly have registered properly\n\nIf you spend a lot of time doing online browsing and/or writing, a Chromebook is probably right for you.\nIf you're into gaming, digital art, etc., you're better off getting a more conventional computer.\n\nEDIT:\nOctober 7th, 2014: Horror of horrors, I dropped my completely unprotected Chromebook in a parking lot. On pavement. When I picked it up it sure sounded like something was broken, which didn't surprise me, but when I brought it inside and opened the lid, it turned on just like normal. The screen started flickering a bit but even that went away after a couple minutes. A week and a half later, it's still working other than the screen occasionally having fits and flickering, sometimes turning black. Annoying when it's happening, but for what I paid and the abuse it took, this computer was a great deal. If the screen issues get worse I'm going to buy another one, but so far it's tolerable and even the dents/scuffs on the edges of the chromebook aren't too horrible. I'm downright impressed."}

This laptop takes simple to a completely new level where if something gets screwed up you will know it was your fault regardless of age.\n\nThe Chromium OS also takes away the confusion of choosing the feature set of laptops that many times scares those who do not understand them.  Not only is this laptop using a dated processor and very limited other hardware offerings, however due to the operating system the user is left to wait for the hardware to catch up.\n\nAs Google is now offering a decent set of cloud \"Office\" replacements, the user will benefit greatly if they hop on the bandwagon because never again will you be cursing a Windows freeze or a kernel panic for losing the entire document you were typing before the computer screwed it up.  The continuous saving of work product is very embraceable because it doesn't require any additional steps and feels just normal.\n\nNow for what this computer cannot do yet: Networking!  If the chromium system would allow for easy networking of computers I can see a business embracing these as everything saved can be shared in a common cloud drive.  The lack of software however makes this an impossibility.\n\nIt is what it is, and if you want an inexpensive computer and don't do much else than use it for e-mail, internet, and office-type applications this computer is worth a serious look.  I need the features this computer does not have however, so I use it as a coffee table laptop for visitors who just want to check their mail or a sports score."}

It is very good for the price and the touchpad is surprising decent. However, one issue that has come up is a high pitched sound coming from the laptop. This is only audible in quiet rooms but it is there. More than a few people have experienced this issue and have posted about it online. I will probably bring it into a store for exchange but others haven't had any luck. If it were not for this issue, I'd give it 5 stars."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "First of all, let me say that the machine itself is very nice.  It's light, it's sleek, and battery life is fantastic.  My only complaint about the machine is that it does not have a caps lock key.  I don't have to type in all caps very often but when I do, holding shift is a pain in the butt.  I don't see the logic behind removing the caps lock key, but I suppose someone got paid good money to come up with the idea...\n\nIt is a shame that a nice machine is so limited by the castrated Chrome OS.\n\nNow, there are plenty of warnings regarding the fact that a chromebook uses online apps.  I understood that.  However, there is 16 GB free on the hard drive, so I figured that there must be offline apps in the chrome store.  I live in a rural area where internet access is spotty in many places, so if I wanted to edit a text or image file, I would be able to do so.  I also thought I would be able to store and listen to some music.  Not a lot, obviously, but some to keep me occupied if I was in an area where there was no wifi.  I was also hoping for some light, offline games.\n\nSo I head over to the chrome store... and there isn't much.  The selection, even for online apps, is small.  When you install an online app, chrome simply puts a site-specific launcher in the menu.  The game section if the store is particularly heart-wrenching, because many of the games don't even work on light hardware such as this.  I knew something was suspicious when I saw apps that had complex, 3D graphics.  It's as if Chrome just puts links in the store without bothering to check if they even work.  Many games do not even exist anymore.  If you want games, you're stuck with cartoonish multiplayer games, such as you would find on Facebook.\n\nThis would not be a huge problem in and of itself... except, Android is so much more functional.  I have a generic Android device that I spent $30 for on black Friday.  It has many offline apps, a USB keyboard that makes it feel like a netbook, and battery life is even longer.  It is also more customizable as far as appearance goes.  With Chrome OS, all you can really do is change the background.\n\nSo, while this chromebook was cheap, I could have spent even less and gotten a much more functional device.  It's pretty sad.  I can't even use Tor on my chromebook, and with the recent scandals surrounding internet anonymity, I view this as a flaw.\n\nNow, all this being said, there are so pro's to the way ChromeOS functions.  Since everything is in the cloud, if the OS is damaged in any way, the Chrome recovery tool will fix everything up in a no time, and all your data will be safe in the cloud.\n\nMy biggest feeling with ChromeOS... disappointment.  Google could have created a more traditional OS and swept Microsoft aside.  Linux is incredible and the open source community is vast, and many applications that compete with Microsoft apps already exist.\n\nInstead, all I got was a netbook that runs the Chrome browser.  That is literally all ChromeOS is, a glorified browser.\n\nIt is possible to install Linux on a chromebook, but there are problems with the touchpad.  Furthermore, installing another OS entails entering developer mode, where a scary boot screen stating that the OS is damaged appears with every boot.  The screen advises you to press a certain key to repair the OS... which will wipe your entire Linux install.  With a single keystroke.  Not a big deal if you know what you are doing, but if some unsuspecting friend booted your machine and read the message, you can kiss your data goodbye.\n\nIf you do most of your stuff online, ChromeOS is fine, if you like paying more for less.  Otherwise, steer clear."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "EDIT:\nThis unit died after about six months of service.  If you google \"Acer Chromebook will not turn on\" you get a lot of hits regarding how these Acer Chromebooks seem to go dark for no apparent reason.  After using it for six months, I put the unit to sleep, and that's the last I saw of a working unit.  The Chromebook will not turn back on. I have cracked it open, pulled the battery, used a borrowed power supply from another identical Chromebook, tried all the remedies listed online, but no joy.  The unit is DEAD as a door nail.  This is a listed issue with these Acer Chromebooks.  I am very technically savvy and I can't get it to boot up.  No matter what I try.  For the price, I'm not sure if six months of service is truly a good deal.  You will have to do the research on your own and determine if you want to chance it.  Some last a decent time, and others go dark after a day or two of being used.  It's basically a crap shoot.\n\nTechnically, this is an Android Tablet without a Touch Screen and with a Keyboard Attached.  You get 2 gig of operating memory and 16 gigs of app memory for your apps and music and movies.  There is a full SD card port on the side, as well as an HDMI output and two USB Ports.\n\nAlso, there are decent speakers (Stereo) and a Mini Cell Phone type port for using your Headphones with Mic.  Yes, it has a mic/speakers and camera built in, but you can also plug in your Smartphone Headset and listen or make calls with Google Voice.\n\nIt's lightning fast OS (Android) compared to my old Windows Laptop, AND, everything happens in the cloud (Google Drive).  You have to print via cloud. There is no printer output.  It does have Bluetooth as well as Wifi. Screen resolution and brightness are GREAT.\n\nIf you want a cool and useful alternative to your Laptop and/or Tablet while mobile, this may be it.  Google has done a great job with this OS.  It does the basics and is economical - AND - the battery lasts for 8 hours or more!  You can't beat that.  Just keep in mind my comments above.  You can't depend on the unit long term in my experience."}

Its light, thin and very mobile. I always take this on motorcycle trips. It doesn't take up much room at all. I prefer this over any pad type device of the same size because it has a keyboard and can sit on a table or your lap by itself, leaving both hands free. No need to hold and balance it like a pad device with one hand and use a finger to operate. Pad devices were great when they came out, but are too big and heavy, they don't stand up unless you purchase a stand or case w/stand for more money."}

Even the wallpaper was the same.  It was just like I was booting up the original chromebook.\nAnd, google was immediately on top of the heartbeat virus, and virus protection is already built -in the chromebook OS is constantly updating for free in the background without you even knowing it.  No more pop ups from Norton or McAfee or whoever trying to alert you, get you to buy some terrible virus protection that cripples your machine.  I can't say enough about how happy I am with the interplay between chromebook, my google e-mail and drive account, and my android phones.  Google has got it right.  I can access any of my files from any devices.\nThat said, the feel is a little \"cheap.\"  Not as solid and elegant as a Mac Airbook, for example.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I've tried using my smartphone and a couple of Android tablets as devices to surf the web on while watching TV, and none of them ever gave me an enjoyable experience:  while two of them actually had slightly higher resolution screens than this Chromebook, none of them were easy to navigate for me due to links being too small to easily click on and my strong preference for physical versus virtual keyboards.  So I wanted a small, light laptop that would allow me to surf the web while getting the benefits of a laptop vs tablet (touch type and precision pointer/click control).  This Chromebook fits all of my needs easily.  I get over 7 hours on a single charge (though unfortunately my battery level and charge-time indicators are somewhat inaccurate), and web pages load very quickly even on a 802.11-g router that's connected to slowish DSL.  I plugged a USB headset into this and was able to use it to do a Google video call in combination with the built-in 720p webcam with no driver install process or setup issues at all.  I use this at home, work, and the homes of family members, and it seamlessly transitions between wifi access points.  I did encounter one issue that only ever happened on an AT&T DSL connection where images and pages sometimes were timing out or not loading, seemingly due to DNS issues, as though the browser were giving up too quickly to resolve and/or load, but hard-setting DNS to always use Google's servers seems to have fixed that issue.  Which brings up a good point:  for those willing to use Google and do some tinkering, even without installing Linux there are lots of settings and tools you can use to get a bit more functionality and customization than what the standard ChromeOS interface provides.\nTwo issues worth mentioning:  any SD card will stick about half-way out of the card slot, which is unfortunate.  After extensive searching, it seems that there is no current micro-SD to full-size SD adapter that will fit completely within the slot, either.  The screen is also somewhat low-end:  while the resolution has not yet been a problem at all, the viewing angles and blue-haze common to low-end LCD panels are both very apparent here.  I sometimes find myself tilting the screen to odd angles in an attempt to mitigate the viewing-angle problem, but it's a minor inconvenience overall.  Watching 720p/HD streaming shows/movies is entirely possible thanks to the decent CPU/GPU, but the picture quality, especially in darkish scenes, will suffer on this screen.  Luckily, there is also a full-sized HDMI out port that you can use to connect to a better monitor or TV when available."}

For people that are using specialized software, this isn't the device because you can't install software on this. Basically, if you can find what you want on the Internet without having to install anything to run the application, you are good to go on this device! The web tools that can't be used on here due to needing JAVA or similar software have some type of alternative on the Google App Store for free - at least what I needed. As far as storage limitations, you can always get additional cloud storage through Dropbox.  For a student that can afford to delete files or upload to other cloud storage solutions, I say go for it. I'm not planning on activating the 2 years of extra storage.  Therefore I am not going to be concerned with having to pay a fee in 2 years.\nFor word processing, presentations, etc., you can use Google Drive or Microsoft's version - OneDrive.

The C720 Chromebook uses Google Apps (which are very clean cut and easy to use) in place of Windows Software.  This allows the device to work online at speeds that my gaming computer couldn't match up with!  I highly recommend this piece of equipment to anyone who needs something to surf the web with, maybe right a quick essay, do some studying, or stream a few movies.

I think this is perfect for older generation who just barely were understanding computers before Windows8 came out and f'ed up their lives. My mother needs one... she cannot figure out Windows 8 and we're so tired of doing \"tech support\" for both our parents. Completely worth the $150 these refurbished computers cost. It's very lightweight with a smaller monitor on it so keep that in mind. I do think getting the bigger monitor might be helpful for older generation so they don't have issues seeing the screen.\n\nThis is not great if you want to do a LOT with it... we play a lot of video games that play in high resolution and we tend to buy higher end computers as a result. There's no touch screen. We do love Google though so this system is really nice in that respect... we use a LOT of google products and it's very friendly to doing that.\n\nI see this also as a great alternative to getting a tablet. It's small enough to keep beside you to do a quick search or let the kids play a web based game (we use a learning website for our 30 month old and I think this would work well for that). My 30 month old thinks this is \"his\" computer now and likes to carry it around the house. He's got the mousepad figured out easily. I've seen they have protective covers you can buy for them (like a cell phone case) that we might pick up if our mother-in-law won't accept this."}

It runs smooth as ever and is lightning fast. I use this for web browsing and surfing the web over my Dell Inspiron 15, which I bought to work on excel projects and download language software (I want to learn Spanish, and I needed Windows to install such a program). You can use a Chromebook to work on excel or word through Onedrive for FREE, but it is not very typical, as the screen is small and it does not perform all the functions it would on a windows computer with Microsoft office. I do know they have Office 365, but I have yet to try it on a Chromebook. I think Google has a bright future with laptops, if they could start producing tablets or more powerful laptops, I would definitely invest in one.\n\nAll in all, buy a Chromebook. It is definitely worth it."}

I did buy a mouse to go with it though because I just don't do so well with those finger pads but it could be that it is because I had gotten so used to having a mouse.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "So, as many of the other glowing reviews say, the Acer C720 is a great little device. The battery life alone is insane and probably worth the price tag. This thing boots open the second you open the screen pretty much and is very responsive.\n\nCons:\n\nYes, it is extremely frustrating when you can't get an internet connection. Yes naysayers, you can work offline, but this often requires planning and offline syncing when you are online before you go to being offline. Also, the offline syncing for apps is not automatic, so you have to make a concious effort to sync your stuff for offline work if you don't think you'll have access to the internet.\n\nThat said, you can install Chrubuntu or some other form of Linux to get a \"fully functional\" laptop, although I tried this and had some difficulty (I was unsuccessful in loading Chrubuntu) and my HTPC runs on Linux so I was a little surprised at how confusing the dual boot was considering so many forums say it is so easy.\n\nRegardless, for the battery life and the power for someone who always works online anyway (google docs, youtube and google play for music, and the internet in general) I think it is much better to get than a windows laptop, mac, etc., ESPECIALLY if it is a second device.\n\nEveryone loves a tablet until they want a keyboard with a mouse.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I am blown away by the quality of the Acer C720 and with Chrome OS. First, the touchpad and keyboard are better than those on my Sony laptop that cost 5.5 times more. The screen, while not hi-res, works perfectly well for TV and movie viewing. Let's face it, you're not buying this to run your home theater and watch The Matrix.\n\nRegarding Chrome OS, there are very few things I do with a computer that it will not do:\n1) Skype calls (I knew this going in, so it wasn't a surprise)\n2) Various file syncing programs (Dropbox, JungleDisk, Box) that I use for different things. Of course, I can access my files online, but for business reasons I cannot move some of these to Google Drive.\n3) A few specific, proprietary non-web applications that will run on Chrome OS (or Ubuntu or OSX for that matter). My workaround for this is Chrome Remote Desktop, whereby I can access my Windows machine perfectly from my Chromebook.\n\nOther than that, I can do everything I need including email, calendar, shopping, news reading, weather, and checking a couple of social sites.  And, by the way, the browsing speed and app switching is speedy, flawless and \"just works\".\n\nThere are many, many use cases where this could truly be the only machine you need on a day-to-day basis. For non-work computer use, it is all I need and then some.  And I cannot stress enough the quality of the keyboard and touchpad relative to other Windows machines I've used.\n\nI even bought one for my father, who get frustrated immediately when technology doesn't \"do what he's thinking\" (you know the type), and so far he's really enjoying the machine and Chrome OS. And I share mine with my kids, who can do much of their schoolwork on it."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "A Chromebook does not do everything a laptop can, but it does 90% of what most people use a laptop for.  Specifically, what it does, and does very well, is surf the internet.  It does this faster than any computer I've used.  It boots up in less than 7 seconds, also much faster than other computers I've used.  It has a battery life that easily lasts over 6 hours, and it also recharges incredibly fast.  Finally, it is much lighter and more portable than a laptop.  While it looks like the old \"netbooks\", this product is many times superior to those outdated, balky computers.  Amazingly, this product accomplishes all this magic for what I consider to be the best bang for the buck available in computers today ($200). I also own a desktop and a Kindle Fire, but this little computer has become the machine of choice for 90% of my computer time.  In summary, I have a love/hate relationship with most computers, so far with this machine it's all love."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "For the money, the Acer C720 (2GB) isn't just one of the best Chromebook on the market, it's one of the better cheap laptops on the market. For $199 at the time of my purchase, I could not be happier with what I got for my money. This 11.6\" laptop is great on battery life, has stellar performance, and houses a sleek and portable form factor. Chrome OS is limited to some, but with a constant internet connection and a computer at home that you can remote desktop to (not entirely necessary), there isn't much you can't do with a Chromebook. The dual-core Intel Celeron (Haswell) CPU inside isn't power hungry, it doesn't put out much heat at all, and it powers Chrome OS like a boss. The C720 also carries 2GBs of RAM, which is plenty for most of what you'll be doing inside of Chrome. You won't have any stuttering or lag with multiple tabs open in Chrome, a video playing or music in the background while blogging on social media. At the time of this review I currently have 6 tabs open, including a livestream on Twitch.tv, and there is no lag whatsoever. Battery life is also fantastic. With social media, email, music, and word processing, you can expect anywhere from 7 - 9 hours with the C720, slightly less if constantly streaming video. I had a day where I unplugged the laptop at 7am, used it for notes and videos through school till around noon, then used it all day at work researching tech and playing videos; I ended the day at 10pm with around 49% battery, I then proceeded to use the laptop most of the next day at home before it finally dying around 3pm. So you can expect to get through a whole day with this Chromebook. Another additional benefit is USB 3.0. There is 1 on this laptop, as well as a single USB 2.0 port on the other side of the laptop. You also have full HDMI out for running an extra HDMI enabled monitor/tv. This greatly improves functionality if you enjoy having multiple displays. It's lightweight, portable, looks great and the build quality is superb for a sub $200 laptop, but there are a couple downsides. The original carried a full-size SD card slot (when inserted, the card would be flush with the laptop, making portable storage easy), the C720 lacks this, and only carries a half-depth SD card slot, minor downside. Also, there are no function keys as well as no caps lock key, like the original. I would like to be able to ALT-F4 out of Chrome, instead I have to CTRL-W to close each tab/window individually. The screen is 11.6\" and has a resolution of 1333x768, which is just fine for a 11\" laptop. Viewing angles and color reproduction wasn't the best, but you won't have many complaints sitting in front of the laptop for a few hours. Another downfall out of the box was the keyboard, the keys were shallow but well spaced. After a couple days of use I got completely used to this and am now typing this review on the C720 at 60+ WPM.\n\nTo conclude, if you're on a budget looking for a laptop, already live inside of Google's ecosystem or are okay with living in the cloud (no classic Windows applications/limited storage), then this laptop will serve you well. The C720 has the best battery life for a Chromebook on the market, other than Dell's Chromebook 11 ($100 more than the C720 at the time of this review),which only carries a couple hours of battery life over the Acer here. Other than that, you won't find better performance, battery life and a simple, utilitarian design in any other sub $200 laptop.\n\nPros:\nPerformance\nBattery life\nPortability\nLoud speakers\nGood trackpad with easy-to-use gestures\n\nCons:\nScreen viewing angles and colors\nLack of caps lock key and F4 key. (Search key can be swapped with Caps lock in settings)\nKeys are a bit shallow and hard to use at first\n\nIf you reading this feel I didn't cover some aspect of the laptop, feel free to ask a question on this review, I'm very active in replying to Amazon questions. Thanks!"}

And that is the end of the good news.\n\nBeyond the physical hardware itself I find nothing useful about the Chromebook design at all.  I did not expect the Chromebook to replace my full blown Windows or Linux PC's.  I did, however, expect to be able to do a few key activities.\n\n1.  I use gmail for business and personal email as do many people I know.  On a Windows machine I can look at both account easily by using 2 different browsers and being looged in to each gamil account in a different browser.  Chrome OS IS the browser so you log into the machine using your gmail account.  To Look at another gmail account your have to log out and log into the machine as a different user.  This got old after the first hour of use.\n\n2.  Let kids play games and browse with some limitations.  As far as gaming online goes this chrome OS appears to be useless.  When my kid is using this machine I am getting called to assist every 2 minutes because some plugin is required and is either not supported by chrome or has crashed.  Playing exact same online games on a Windows PC works fine 90% of the time.  On Chrome OS is works 10% of the time.\n\n3.  Remote desktop.  It does not work.  Period.  I am technically adept and must use VPN clients to access remote machines for my job every day.  Chrome simply does not support VPN.  I tried very hard to get this to work and will not devote my time to elaborate on details here.  Suffice to say Chrome's remote desktop is not an option for me and VPN does not work.\n\nI wanted this Chromebook concept to work for me and I tried hard to make it work.  Chromebook as a concept does not provide myself or my family with what we need.  My simple Android tablet provides more flexibility and options than Chromebook does for basic email and browsing.\n\nRegarding support:  there is none.  I called and was told as much by Acer.  You are on your own.  Good luck."}

Full access to the real web, no mobile site BS, and a full size keyboard are so much nicer than touch typing on glass, or a cramped expensive Bluetooth keyboard.\n\nI love the fit and finish.  Solidly built.  No creaks or squeaks.  It's just heavy enough to feel expensive, but not enough to tire you out.  Excellent battery life.  Very portable size.  Intuitive trackpad gestures make mouse interactions work almost as well as a real mouse.\n\nThe only real knock I can find against it is the display.  Good viewing angles are really tight, and just a few degrees up or down will wash all of the colors out.\n\nIf you're a power user, you can partition the drive in half, and dual-boot ChromeOS and Linux for a complete laptop experience without the Windows tax.  I can even install Steam and play my indie games on the go.  Very happy with my purchase!"}

For the price I thought this was great and I loved the concept. It was small and fast and perfect for those times when I just wanted to watch a movie or do a little shopping. However 6 months after purchasing the unit, the cord went bad. I had to go round and round with Acer to send me a replacement cord. I even had to buy an off brand replacement until I could get them to ship one out. Then I started having issues with the unit heating up too much and shutting down on me even when I was not running any apps. The last straw was when, less than a week after the year long warranty  ran out, the jack for the power cord started malfunctioning. I could only get it to charge in a few positions. I looked into getting it fixed and it will cost more to have it fixed than what it cost me to purchase the Item, a total loss.\n\nI now write this review from the MacBook Pro that I finally just bit the bullet and bought.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I'm on it right now!!! it works great!! the speakers could be in a better place. but other than that it works great. Down side if you don't exit out and shut it down every night, the lights on the screen will go out. this has happened twice ,but i can still see the words in the black, so i have turned it off, off and put the back by a fan and in a couple of hours its fine. I did call Amazon and Acer it wasn't even 90 days and it didn't even have that as a warranty. so basically if the screen goes out i have an expensive door jamb.  But as of now I have a nice inexpensive CHROMEBOOK its different than a notebook, so please save yourself the trouble and look it up. For my 10 year olds first lap top its perfect, when he gets to use it, which isn't a lot :) the battery lasts about 6 hours which is awesome..  *** I will be buying another one,for me :)\n\nsorry I didn't add, the screen went black, i believe because of how hot is was getting from not shutting it down between uses. Also there is only 1 maybe 2 teeny fans for this product. I am thinking of buying a product here that is 3 fans and you out the chromebook on top of it. If I knew how hot it would be I would have purchased one, they're very inexpensive, so if it didn't work I wouldn't be out much. it has the 16 ssd, but you get the cloud for two years for free, so that's a pro. all of these \"cons\" the smaller fans, and  hard drive is how they can make it so very light, w/ a long battery life and so inexpensive. it does come in  32 ssd, but it was more than I wanted to spend. Also when you get updates you won't even know it as you do not have to wait to use your chrome, it's like the update fairies came and went.. and it does update a lot, so its always current, or so ive read on the chrome blog sites and they have many!"}

The C720 is definitely a second computer, but it is the best web based device to have.  It has a decent screen size, real light weight, a super long battery life (8 hrs), almost instant on use (I use to do quick checks of my email before I boot up my iPhone or desktop), and fast (I find it loads web pages faster than my desk, Ivy Bridge i7 16gig RAM desktop machine).  I believe the virus checking on my desktop and continual updating really slows things down.  I think that the MAC and Windows based machines have to watch their backs.  Now there are downsides.  I one that bugs me the most is the lack of DELETE key on the Chromebook keyboard.  If you are looking for doing Email and web surfing this is the best thing you can do for yourself."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "Believe it or not, on the same day I learned that the new Samsung Chromebook 2's would be released on April 28, I went ahead and bought the Acer C720.  Why?  First of all, Chromebooks have been interesting to me for a long time, but I'm not an early adopter.  I tried an Android Transformer tablet/keyboard last summer and recently work gave us Windows 8 tablet/laptops. My profile is a tinkerer--and a cheap one at that.  I have a Roku and Chromecast, I mess around with XBMC, and I try to stretch all my tech dollars.  I wanted a simple, lightweight, mobile device with a keyboard--something handy for surfing on the couch, stashing it away in a backpack and riding the bike to my local coffee shop for some writing.  The other reviews and numerous Youtubes on this unit are consistently very good.  What finally snagged me was the XP laptop trade-in deal offered by a local retailer and suggested by an article on CNET, which enabled me to bring this home at half-price.\n\nPlaying with it for a night and a morning (normal Chrome apps, Outlook.com (just to see if I could still use Microsoft stuff), and Chrome Desktop), I'm convinced of a couple of things:\n-$200 is totally the sweet spot for Chromebooks.  This thing can do a lot and does it very fast, but it can't do everything.  Everyone should know that by now.  That's not a \"con\" for me.  I know this going in.  But at this price, what it does is incredible.\n-Waiting for the new Samsung Series means saving up another $100-200.  The new hardware looks intriguing (I'm generally a Samsung fan) and I bet it's very nice, but at $349-399 for the new units I'm starting to think Windows (the Asus Transformer Book T100, for example).  By the way, Windows 8's schizo Desktop/Metro is starting to grow on me.\n-$1100 for the Macbook Air was a goal until I returned to my profile and use case.  If I want a beautiful piece of hardware that I'll try to use for the next five years without much change, then maybe this is it.  But I'm also not sure I want to stash it in my backpack and crash the bike or bump it around.  I'd baby it too much.\n\nSo thanks to the XP trade in, some passion from Puppylinuxworld on youtube, and reflection on my use, I took the plunge.  It's great!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I bought this for my wife. She loves it and when I asked her if she'd rather have a Macbook Air, she said no, she'd rather have this because if she drops it, she wouldn't feel bad. I can't complain. I've used it quite extensively as well. I can say that it's blazing fast. I have seen no speed issues and battery is very substantial - 2 full length movies on a full charge and some."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I got this as a cheap, lightweight second laptop that I could tote around campus with me. My other laptop is heavy and expensive so I don't like to bring it with me. I didn't want a tablet, and this has been working out so perfectly I use it more than my original laptop! It's basically a little internet machine. That's it. It's not frilly. Not a lot of extra features, but it has everything I need. And the fact that I use google docs for everything means that I can print/access things from anywhere on campus (and the documents automatically save, which I love).\n\nThis little guy is also super fast and can handle a very irresponsible number of tabs without getting hot or laggy at all. I've had 20ish tabs open (was writing a research paper) including netflix (*cough* needed a break) and there was still no noticeable lag and it didn't get hot, just a little warm. Also, it takes such a short time to boot up that sometimes I wonder if I even shut it down properly.\n\nOh, and the tiny amount of storage really hasn't been an issue for me. I keep most of my long-term need-to-keep documents on my main laptop. Plus you've got some space on google drive.\n\nSummary: Great as a partner to your main computing device, but don't expect it to replace that. This isn't the most high-tech, fancy piece of machinery you'll ever interact with, but that's not really the point. I love it for what it is and isn't. It treats me well. We are happy together."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "Recently sold an Asus Transformer with keyboard that was used for a couple of years and took the proceeds to purchase this via the Acer store as a refurb - EXCELLENT purchase!  The whole computing experience is even better than the Android tablet.  Don't get me wrong - Android on my phone is wonderful but when it comes to a larger device, where I tend to do/expect a little more, this Chromebook more than surpasses expectations.\n\nChromebooks offer a computing experience, in my opinion, that closely mirror what one is already familiar with in a traditional PC environment - operation of the hardware, software functionality and overall familiarity make for a small learning curve.  I really also like that you can work offline with it - to an extent.  I've used it only once offline and that was to continue working on a document - it was a success.\n\nThe Acer C720 is overall well designed.  It is thin, lightweight and they keyboard is comfortable to use - especially those of us who are old-school typists :) .  The screen is fine enough - this is at basic hardware and thus you have to expect some areas to be cost cutting.  However, the whole package makes for a great experience.\n\nGoogle is only going to improve the Chrome OS and these devices are going to continue reaping the benefits of those improvements.  Matched to Acer's hardware design and low-cost, they have a hit.  I can see why Chromebooks are picking up in popularity - lightweight, fast, easy to use and reasonable price now brings computing closer to what people as me want.  (I work in IT and believe me, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the simplicity of this thing - I get sooooooo tired of babysitting technology, fixing its many issues at times.)\n\nI'm extremely pleased and look forward to using this Chromebook for the next several years."}

Now that I'm back at my desk I'm not using the laptop as much but it continues to hold its charge when not being used. I plan to use this when I am able to travel again. I'm also sharing it with my wife around the house. We'll be tossing my older, heavy Windows laptop (it was 10 years old anyway). I might add that I bought the Acer 720 model with 4 GB RAM. I really haven't needed that much RAM. 2 GB would have been fine."}

It was infected with a virus, still worked but was beyond its service life, and after three days of wiping the hard drive, reloading and updating XP-pro, downloading all of the drivers from Dell, as soon as I went on Chrome, it immediately got infected again!\n\nOh well, time to bite the bullet, be a mensch and buy her a new one.\n\nWhen I received the Chrome, it came charged, (I plugged it in anyway), and as soon as I turned it on, less than 7 seconds from pressing the power button, it was completely on, ready to work.  WOW! what a difference, not having to wait for Windows to go through its stupid long time startup!!!!\n\nThis Chromebook is lightning fast, super easy to access any wireless network, and perfect for a Senior (and possibly anyone else) that doesn't need to load CD's or DVD's, or do a lot of computing.\n\nI only had about an hour to play with it, load her gmail, establish a Facebook account for her, and to play with a new toy, but ultimately I was super impressed with this Acer and would highly suggest it.\n\nMy only regret so far, is where is the DEL key.  I think they may have eliminated it.  I use that key quite frequently and have other devices that are Apples that also do not have it!\n\nLike I said, I really only played with it for about an hour, and I am not one to read operating manuals, but it seems perfect to do what it is designed to do.  I truly believe this is the product of the future as I thing most computing is going to be done from the cloud anyway."}

I've heard about a lot of people who buy this and are disappointed having realized after the fact that the computer isn't running Windows (or Mac OS).\n\nThis cheap little \"disposable\" computer will do what 99% of computer users use a computer to do 90% of the time (thats a mouthful).  That is: \"browse\" the web, manage our inbox and spam, and use some form of social networking to let people know that I accidentally picked out two different pairs of socks (what a numbskull).  The best part about the whole thing is that it is linux based; though few will understand the value in that!\n\nIf grandma or grandpa need a computer to break into the social network scene, this is it.  If little Timmy needs a computer to do his homework, this is it.  If I want to run my business by utilizing various web based softwares including Google Apps for Business, this is an excellent option for when I'm on the road (tested, true).\n\nWhen you're buying a MacBook as a status symbol, or a Dell out of ignorance, STOP; and consider a Chromebook (you won't regret it)."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "We needed a faster computer for Facebook, online videos, etc. and couldn't afford a full fledged laptop, so after reading some reviews of the Chromebook, I realized that it would do everything we wanted to do online and at a very low cost. You just have to buy into the concept that it uses the online Google software and applications for spreadsheets, word processing, etc.; there is no actual hard drive, just a small 2 gig storage drive that works similar to a built-in usb flash drive, and they give you some extra space on Google Drive free for a couple of years. You can also save files to USB flash drives using the usb ports, but you have to download to the built-in drive first and then cut and paste to the flash drive. There is no DVD player or burner. You can't install on-board software; but we use it mainly for web browsing, You Tube videos, Facebook, etc., so we are very happy with our Acer Chromebook, especially for the low price we paid; and would definitely recommend it to a friend. It apparently has a very fast processor and can stream high definition videos even with multiple windows open. It has a large high definition screen - the picture quality is excellent and it is very thin and lightweight, and the sound quality is amazingly good from the small built-in speakers.  It also has a built-in web cam which is surprisingly good quality. You can't use Skype, but you can use Google Hangouts which is similar to Skype.  The only problem we have had is that it often has trouble finding our home wi-fi network and I have to reset my router every now and then and restart the Chromebook to clear up the problem; but I think the problem is being caused by my antique router which I need to replace. As an experiment, I took the Chromebook to several bookstores, coffee shops, McDonald's etc. to test it and it jumped right onto the wi-fi networks every time - it is only at home that I have the connection problems, so I think the Chromebook is fine as long as you have a good strong wireless router. All in all - a very good value and a good product for wireless web browsing."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "Wow. Bought a few of these (one for me and one for the wife). For less than $400, these two Chromebooks do just about everything we need them to. Only have one Windows desktop PC in the house now for storage and photo editing. For portable use, there is very little reason to NOT get a Chromebook since they are perfect for laptop-type usage. Even my daughter has our older C710 in her room hooked via HDMI to a 32\" TV and wireless Logitech keyboard/mouse so she can watch her shows and browse/research. The mouse and keyboard was plug and play. Literally took 10 seconds. Unreal compared to Windows. So, we're almost exclusively a Chromebook family now. We have a few HP wireless printers and these Chromebooks print via Google Cloud Print to them flawlessly. Nice!\n\nFather-in-law replaced his aging desktop PC with Windows XP to the larger Toshiba Chromebook that's $279 but has a larger screen. The simplicity and speed blows him away. And, no more hours spent doing technical support, waiting on mounds of updates to process all on a Windows install that's not really needed. I would surmise almost everything most home computer users need can be done in a browser and simple file system. That's a Chromebook...\n\nIt's pretty amazing that I can get a Nexus 5 and two fast and long-lasting Chromebooks for almost exactly the same price as an iPhone 5S with 32GB of RAM. So, that's what I've done :-)"}

The screen and trackpad both work very well but show some signs of a $200 small laptop. Nothing to worry about in my opinion.\n\n I bought it along with a larger solid state drive and then installed ubuntu on it with crouton. The whole process was pretty approachable and greatly expanded what one can do with the computer. I would recommend this computer to just about anyone who isn't doing serious photo/video/audio editing or gaming. I've also had trouble running a virtual machine on it, so people who rely on one should be wary.\n\nMost people, myself included don't need the heavy duty supercomputers that pass as a laptop nowadays for home usage.

But I didn't want to spent too much money for a full-blown notebook, as my main purpose was web surfing and email checking. So, my choice would be either tablet, or chromebook. I tried the 7 inch and 8 inch tablet and I was not happy with the small screen real estate as I didn't want to hurt my vision with small fonts. So, I gave it a try on chromebook.\n\nI was surprised that such an inexpensive device could do so much. The whole setup took about 2 to 3 minutes only. After having it for couple of days, it became my favorite machine just because it was so simple, light and super fast start-up with the solid-state drive. Better yet, I never need to worry about virsus or malware. And the battery life was great...8 to 9 hours run on my tests. Some people complained about the keyboard. Frankly, I didn't feel anything wrong with the keyboard.\n\nHowever, the display was a little bit dim for my taste. So, I usually brought up the brightness. This was done easily with the brightness adjustment keys on the keyboard. Not a big deal.\n\nI bought the Acer Chromebook from local *C*O*S*T*C*O store because it had a very generous 90-day return policy. Before the end of the 90-day trial period, I bought one more for my daughter for doing homework at after-school center. It's cheap enough so I won't feel too bad if it is damaged.\n\nUp to now, I have owned the Acer Chromebook for more than half year and it's used on daily basis. I am very happy with it, especially with its low price and good features. I would definitely recommend Chromebook to my friends."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I love this computer! I have been working in technology for over 20 years and traditional computers are great for corporate work. For my personal use, I am far less needy. Even with my technology background, in my home I only need the internet for my email, banking, browsing, and creating the occasional document. A few years ago, I drank the Google Kool Aid and most of my world is tied up with them. This makes this the perfect computer for me. Upon unboxing it, I was up and running in about a minute. Everything I do with my traditional Windows computer is done on this small, light, powerful machine.\n\nI was forever updating and cleaning my Windows machine. I work with troubled computers all day long. I did not want to come home to deal with my own. This little beast has cured me of that pain. I boot it up and it just works. No waiting, no updating, no pop-ups. It is truly headache free.\n\nThere are three small inconveniences for me. First, I have a NAS. If you don't know what that is, you won't care. It has a web interface, but it is far easier to manage the files by connecting to it via the Windows file system. This has been easily addressed by keeping my traditional Windows laptop booted up and underneath the bed in my guest bedroom. I can easily control it from the Chromebook via Google Remote Desktop. That allows me to do file cleanups on my NAS when necessary. I am hopeful that someday either Google or a third party will find a way for me to connect to the NAS without making too many changes to my Chromebook. For now, I am just fine.\n\nThe other two issues have to do with my networked multi-function laser printer. I got an awesome deal on an older model Brother laser printer last year and I have no need or desire to replace it right now. If I were so inclined, I would invest in a newer model that is Google Cloud Print ready. Until then, my Windows machine is up and running for my NAS anyway, I don't mind that I also have to keep it running for Cloud Print. That is the easy part. Then there is scanning. I do a lot of scanning. The only way I was able to make that work is to use ScanWorks CloudScan. It works wonderfully, but again, you need to have the Windows computer running.\n\nTwo of my three issues will forever be resolved when I upgrade my printer. I know there are other ways to deal with the NAS issue, but for now I am OK with leaving the Windows machine running.\n\nAs for documents and such, I have been using Google Docs for quite some time now. I have determined that Microsoft's Office is far too bloated with crap that I simply don't need. Google keeps making improvements including allowing you to work offline for most of its products. I find that I am rarely offline, but it is nice to know that it is there. Saving to the cloud is brilliant. You never have to worry about hard drive failure or losing your computer. It is also nice to know you can get your information anywhere as long as you have access to a network connection.\n\nAs I said, I drank the Google Kool Aid and I am a convert. I believe this is the future (at least for now). Google has managed to combine the user friendly design of Apple with the functionality of Microsoft in a very affordable package. For the price of one Apple Mac, you can have an entire network (computer, tablet, phone, television streaming device, printer, router) any geek can be proud of.\n\nThis is my first Chromebook. I could not have asked for a more powerful, sleek, and convenient machine for such a good price. I know some have complained about the keyboard, the touchpad and the display. I have no issue with any of it. I am incredibly happy with this purchase and see many more years of Google computing ahead of me."}

I also have a windows desktop that replaced my windows laptop and the chromebook filled the gap with me needing to use a laptop at school or on the go occasionally.  I love how fast it is, boots up in like 7 seconds, always up to date and virus protection built in so you don't have to worry about anything like that.  Also unlike a windows pc it doesn't slow down after time, it's always fast.  The battery life is also amazing on this thing, depending on what you're doing and the screen brightness you can get upwards of 9 hours out of this thing which is awesome.  I have had multiple tablets and I prefer this instead because I can type documents and longer emails easily.  The keyboard and touchpad are very intuitive with cool shortcuts and gestures.  This thing does have an acer ac adapter but it charges from dead to full extremely fast, in under 2 hours.  It does have an SD card slot, a USB 3.0 port, a USB 2.0 port, and an HDMI out.  The HDMI out does full 1080p and it's super smooth and crisp even when streaming 1080p netflix or local videos, so I was quite impressed when hooking it up to my 40\", also streaming from the HDMI doesn't take much battery if you close the lid so you can stream without plugging in for probably upwards of 5-6 hours."}

Insighfully designed to take advantage of modern technology, the internet and wireless LANs: which are ubiquitous these days.  Sort of a cross between a tablet and a laptop.  It is becoming my device of choice.  I really appreciate the simplicity and bug-free operation of the Chrome browser.

I hated typing on my phone and needed something just a little better. Since I use Google Docs for a lot of things anyway it seemed a natural fit. I love this thing. It's perfect for surfing, Facebook, Twitter and Youtube.  I use it to stream Pandora and Stitcher at home, and it has great sound for a little guy. The battery lasts for ever, and the video resolution is fine for streaming Netflix or Amazon Prime video.\n\nIt weighs nothing, I carry it around with me in my file folders and it boots up in an instant.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "FIRST of all, if you are looking for an affordable netbook, this is a great machine. And this review really isn't for you.  What you'll find is a fast little machine that runs Chrome, from which you can watch videos and check your email.  No problem there.  The video quality is mediocre, but really, it's what one would expect from a super affordable machine.\n\nNOW...\nThere are some things that have changed since some of the first questions were answered.\n\nCitrix - No Longer runs on this machine.  Citrix has withdrawn their product.  The way it works now you can only use Citrix if you can convince your company to run Citrix software on their server to support you. [I don't know about you but our system guys aren't going to update the system to support one or two people.]\n\nJava - Doesn't support java.  It looks to us that Google is going to HTML5, which is a non-issue for most people.  We're exploring switching over to Ubuntu to allow us some Java, but that's not something everyone's going to want to do.\n\nSUMMARY\nProcessor performance is awesome. Streaming is great. The display screen is acceptable.  And overall, I think this little machine rocks.  However, it's not ready for some business applications since Citrix no longer runs on it.\n\nHighly recommend."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I am in charge of finding and purchasing computers for my school and I recently bought a couple of these for some students to pilot prior to buying this model in quantity. This is a great Chromebook! It is speedy, has good wifi connectivity, and has all of the features I would expect when buying a pricier model of computer such as a webcam and HDMI port. The battery life on this Chromebook is also insanely good. I have been consistently getting about 7-8hrs of battery life while doing light web browsing and word processing.\n\nNow for the slight downsides to this model. First, the 2GB of RAM is not upgradeable later on. The modules are soldered to the motherboard and therefore, cannot be removed. I would have liked to have been able to add more memory later on as the computers aged but alas, that will not be the case with this model. For that reason, I would suggest buying the 4GB model that is available for slightly more money. The 4GB makes the Chromebook a slight be zippier and will help it age more gracefully. The reason I opted for the 2GB version was to see how it performed for the students during their daily tasks and I was also looking to save some money. When I do a complete rollout to the student body, I may end up purchasing the 4GB model for the extra $50 a piece.\n\nLastly, if this is your first Chromebook and you are used to a bigger screen, I don't need to tell you this screen is noticeably smaller than what you are used to. I do most of my work from a 15\" laptop and this model is a strain on my eyes when I have a lot of tabs open. I think users could get used to this but I just wanted to warn potential buyers. Before buying, trying to see what this model looks like in real life to make sure the screen is adequate for your needs.\n\nThis is a great Chromebook, possibly the best currently on the market at its price point but if you can afford it, get the 4GB version just to stretch the life of the machine a little bit more."}

The easy-setup was just as advertised and the 7-second boot time is no joking at all, cool! It automatically checks for browser updates and there was no need to worry about dealing with register conflicts from various protection apps. Plus C720 runs completely silent with no fan noise like a laptop. Full keyboard making it a lot convenience for people who typed a lot like myself. I would have given this little guy a full 5-star if the battery can be removed to extend the life. It earns  a well-deserved 4.5 stars from me."}

Therefore, you cannot install drivers or play video games that demand high memory or space.\n\nThis Acer Chomebook is what I prefer during this whole tablet revolution.  It performs the same functions, but has a keyboard and navigates within a Google OS that is similar to a Windows OS.  I am strongly considering buying another one, and I will very likely replace my current one with the same thing if/when that needs to happen.\n\nSince there is no high-powered fan, the battery power lasts for hours.  The Chrome web browser is compatible with the popular streaming sites including Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime.  So it is idea for plugging in headphones and binge-watching.\n\nThis product should be classified as a secondary laptop.  You need to have a regular PC as your mothership computer on which your printer drivers can be installed.  As long as this is understood, then his Acer Chromebook is strongly recommended.  It is very much ideal as a web-surfing tool and I would go so far to say I prefer it much more over our Kindles."}

I have found that there is literally nothing that I personally want or need to do on a computer that cannot now be down in the cloud. I have used Windows programs for years for amateur photo, film and sound editing but now there are terrific online alternatives (for the most part free) for all those things--for example, Pixlr Editor, WeVideo and AudioSauna, respectively.  There are online programs for business needs, file conversion and of course Google's office suite, with its new integration with third-party add-ons, has all the functionality that 95% of users could need.\n\nIf you want to find any online alternative to your local software just Google what you want to do followed by \"online\"  and chances are you'll find various options. But the best part is that the future is even brighter with the functionality of the OS constantly growing.  Rather than having a machine that slows down and demands more troubleshooting with time,  you have one that is getting better with each background update.\n\nThere are some people who will need one of the traditional OSes for a while longer--certain professionals and gamers--but for the vast majority of users who are willing to try alternatives to their legacy programs,  the benefits of Chrome OS--speed, security, lack of frustrating technical problems--is well worth the switch."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "This laptop is simplicity and elegance for $200.  I was deciding between this and another Windows netbook and decided to go the Chromebook route and was not at all disappointed.\n\nI recently bought the Asus T100 Windows convertible, which is a good machine when it works, but you have to deal with the clunkiness of Windows 8, a tediously slow charge time, wonky WiFi and a glossy screen.  The trackpad is noisy and ineffectual.  Plus, it cost me $350.  I still use it for Windows apps, but my new go-to is the C720.\n\nThe C720 just works.  You open it up, it boots in a few seconds, you're good to go.  It's light and sturdy and it does most of the things I need it to do.  The fan is barely audible and the battery life is excellent (and it charges quickly).  The keyboard isn't rock solid, but I can type quickly on it and the trackpad is extremely usable.  I'm starting to get the hang of Google Apps and I'm able to do a lot of work on my Google Drive (which is synced to my desktop).  Not all my work, but enough.\n\nThat said, sometimes the computer hiccups with processor-intensive tasks, but not annoyingly so.  The screen is not very good - it has an anti-reflective coating, but it's dim and muddy and the viewing angles are lousy.  The speakers are loud-ish at times, but I hate that they're under the computer where they're easily muffled.  The bezel is so wide, they might as well have put the speakers there.  I still use external speakers or headphones so it's not a deal breaker.  Most annoyingly, the SD card slot is shallow so you can't just keep an SD card in there when you're on the go; it juts out an inch.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, for $200, I will endure a poorly designed SD slot and a mediocre screen.  Battery life and usability make this machine a no-brainer.  It's not for everyone but if you need a supplemental portable or want to give your grandparents a simple way to get connected, this is it.\n\nPerhaps the best moment was when I was showing it to a friend, bragging about its portability and solid state innards.  He said while admiring it, \"Oh, yeah.  I just got one, too.  A Mac Book Air.\"  For what he paid, I could have bought five Chromebooks."}

The only people I would recommend this computer to are people who use their computers for everyday very simple tasks such as, facebook, calculator, searching the web, etc.. But if that's all I wanted a Laptop for I can just use my phone. Sometimes even searching the web wouldn't work though. It constantly disconnected from my internet. I know it was the chromebook, not my internet, because all my Windows computers had no problems. For a computer that basically needs an internet connection, That should not happen.

We have an ancient laptop that weighs in at about 10lbs. and not something anyone would consider portable today.  I bought this little marvel at a pawn shop with 4Gb of ram and 32 GB hard drive for $100 out the door.  What a delightful machine!  It operates very nicely but you do have to get a google account (free) and you will be up and running in no time.  You will also have to figure out how to get your router and the tablet connected... not all that difficult.  This is a very powerful little notebook and if there is a downfall for me it is the keyboard.  My fingers like a traditional keyboard so I have simply reverted to using my index fingers to navigate the keyboard.\n\nThe other thing I like is all the bloatware is gone and you don't have to deal with antivirus software either.  My chromebook is nearly as fast as my desktop computer that has 8gb of ram. I have come to appreciate what salves we are to the sloppy Windows operating systems we all tolerate.  I am very pleased with my chromebook and traveling with it is going to be painless.

As such, I have to be conversant with all major operating systems.  I don't like Apple very much, so you Mac users can probably dismiss what I say.  I hate Windows, but so do all Windows users.  Linux is very cool, but I am really not a fanatic.  ChromeOS is the bomb.\n\nWhat I am is a speed and convenience freak.  My Samsung would boot (from power OFF), in 6 seconds.  This one uses 4 seconds.  That is a 33% decrease.  (Windows guys, that is 4 seconds from power off, not 4 minutes!)  From sleep, it is instantly on.  It cruises between pages in a snap, where the Samsung had a bit of a delay.  Movies are smooth, sound is good, if you use external speakers.\n\nIf you watch the dorky PC commercials, you KNOW that ChromeOS will not run Office.  Funny, I use Microsoft's Office Live, and it seems to work fine.  And Word starts (from off) in 2 seconds, just like Excel and Powerpoint.  The only thing of consequence is that Skype does not work.

If you need a light and fast laptop to basically connect to the internet, the C720 can't be beat, in my view."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I got this Chromebook for my kids and now find myself using it for browsing the web.  It gets the job done for the kids' homework and for light word processing and spreadsheets (Google).  I have not used it much when I don't have an internet connection.  I think it would be almost useless without one.  It is not a problem for us because there is always wifi nearby.  This laptop will not replace a windows or mac laptop, but it is great as a secondary laptop for browsing the web."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I've read too many reviews that whine about this and that supposedly missing from the C720.  It all makes me laugh.  What do people expect for $199?  I expected a lot less than I got.  The C720 is lightening fast, powers up immediately, and is child's play to use.  It even found my iPhone hot spot without a hitch, so I can take the laptop anywhere there isn't a dedicated Wi-Fi signal.  Amazingly, I plugged in my wireless Microsoft Mouse and it worked immediately.  This laptop is a wonder of simplicity, speed, and portability.  It's light yet sturdy enough to last.  Most of what I do is Chrome based to begin with, so this is perfect for me.  Word documents I've moved to Google Drive or open in my email are perfectly readable.  Same with PDF files.  I have a new desktop for Microsoft intensive tasks, an iPhone and iPad for causal use, and now the C720 for intermediate work.  I bought this to replace my two outdated XP Dell machines--and I couldn't be happier.  I especially like the no worries anti-virus controls built into the background of the C720.  If I lose this, I won't be happy but I won't be out all that much money.  It's almost a disposable laptop--and a fine one at that.  For a Chromebook this simply can't be beat.  Buy one.  You won't regret it."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I want to give 5 stars, but for now I cannot.  I purchased the C720 on 2/8/14 and within the first 48 hours I experienced a few \"crashes.\"  I chalked them up as crashes and within the first week focused on finding a bad Chrome extension.  I eventually disabled all extensions but the issue still persisted.  About once a day I would experience a \"crash.\"\n\nThe next step was to contact a Chrome Ninja who did some troubleshooting with me and eventually had me do a powerwash.  After trying this and sending some system data they indicated my Chromebook had been put in developer mode and that they could not help me.  This was interesting because a) it was a new Chromebook and b) while I know what developer mode is I certainly did not perform the steps at any time to enter into developer mode.  After explaining this to the Chrome Ninja he reviewed the information I sent again and said the Chromebook was no longer in developer mode but had been put in dev mode at some point in the past.  Given that, he said the only way for him to continue to assist was for me to do a full recovery of the machine.  No big deal, I made my USB recovery disk and completed the task and started over.\n\nAfter performing the recovery, the machine was still randomly \"crashing\" 1-2 times per day.  After the Chrome Ninja reviewed the latest system info he replied back and said I have a power issue and that I'd need to contact Acer for support/repair.  What I ignorantly wasn't realizing is that the Chromebook wasn't necessarily crashing, it was completely shutting down.  I should have realized that given that I had to press the power button each time it happened for the Chromebook to boot back up, but I just wasn't putting it together I guess since this is my first Chromebook.\n\nNow that I realized what was happening (thank you Chrome Ninja), I contacted Acer for repair since I had unfortunately purchased the Chromebook from Best Buy and I was past my 14 day return window.  At first, Acer wanted me to pay for shipping to their facility in Texas.  While I was annoyed they would even think I would pay for shipping (I told them the Chromebook was brand new and less than 30 days old) it was admittedly not that hard to get them to pay for the shipping.  I simply asked the Acer support representative and it took him about 5 minutes to confirm a free shipping label would be approved.  After a brief hold, he came back and said he was emailing me a shipping label.\n\nSo, that's pretty much where I stand.  I have shipped my brand new Chromebook that I've used maybe a dozen times off to Acer for repair.  While I consider myself an understanding person, I'm quite disappointed that I'm now without my device for a period of time.  I can only hope that they actually repair it correctly and that the issue does not occur again.  Given the random nature of the issue, I'm skeptical at best.  I am hopeful though given the fact that there are so many positive reviews for this device I have to be an anomaly.\n\nI will update my review and rating once I get the device back from Acer.  If anyone else experiences a new machine that just randomly shuts down, don't wait until the return period is over... just swap it out for a new one immediately!\n\nUPDATE: 4/15/2014\n-----------------\nMy Chromebook has been in repair with Acer twice now.  The first time, regarding the power issue above, they simply \"Reloaded OS\" and sent it back.  I had told them, more than once, that I had already done that and it didn't help.  After receiving the Chromebook back in late March, I began to experience the same issue of the Chromebook just randomly powering off on the very day that I received it back from repair.  So, I immediately called Acer support and they immediately, without trouble, sent me a shipping label (again) to send it back for repair (again).  After just 1 day of having the Chromebook back in my possession, I turned around and shipped it off again.\n\nI received the Chromebook back today, 4/15, with a note reading, \"Unable to replicate symptoms of the unit shutting down.  Unit remained powered on while streaming videos from youtube for more than 24 hours.  No trouble found.\"  Fair enough, but at this point I'm just waiting for the issue to happen again, at which time I will send it in... again.  Luckily, Google has been very helpful and they are helping me figure out what the issue is.  I just have to wait for it to happen again and they're going to analyze the data I send them from a feedback report.\n\nI'm trying to remain patient as I know my issue is difficult to replicate and is very random, but I would love to be able to talk to a more technical person at Acer to explain my issue as I believe things are getting \"lost in translation...\"  The other issue is I'm thinking it's battery related, and I would be the Acer tech left the Chromebook plugged in, and I've only experienced the issue while on battery power.\n\nGiven the above... I've updated my rating to 2 stars."}

I really like the Chromebook, and you can read 100's or great reviews about what it does but one thing i didn't see in any reviews that i wish i knew before hand is this- the apps that you buy in the Google Play store for an Android phone or tablet and not the same apps that are always available for the Chromebook.  For the Chromebook, you buy the apps from the Google Chrome site and not Google Play so for example, i wanted the Infinity X1 remote app for the Chromebook but it is not available for it, but it is on in Google Play for phone's and tablets.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I purchased this product about two weeks ago from Amazon. It was packaged securely and arrived a day before the estimated delivery date. It's exceeded my expectations for the most part. I'm very minimalist, and so is this laptop.\n\nPros: FAST start up, like 2-5 second fast.\nEasy to use if you're familiar with the chrome browser, and really isn't all that hard to learn otherwise -- very minimal, I would definitely recommend this as a laptop for an individual who isn't that good at handling computers (I would say the elderly but the screen is very tiny so that might be a problem...).\nFast everything, honestly. Videos run smoothly, even if I have 10 other tabs open.\n\nCons: Battery life isn't as good as the reviews make it out to be. Maybe I got a defective one or something, but my battery life is just as good as any other laptop -- 4 to 5 hours.\nWebcam quality isn't *that* great but it's good enough. When I do hangouts with other's they describe me looking like a watercolor painting.\nThere are popular programs that you won't find an alternative app for such as Skype. Big bummer.\nIf you're an artist, there's a good chance your tablet won't work. You might be able to use it but there is no pressure sensitivity which could be a crucial thing for you depending on what type of art you create.\n\nThe only thing I was disappointed about when I first got this was how small this machine actually is. It is 11.6 inches but the screen itself is 10. Sometimes pages are a little mis-matched because the items on the page don't fit together so they kind of get squished together. This for the most part isn't a big problem, in fact the only encounter with this problem I've had is on the site Gaiaonline. But you get used to the screen size quite quickly.\n\nI've seen complaints about the sound quality as well, but I don't have that problem."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I've had this Chromebook for 3 months now, so this review is long overdue. When the first ever Chromebook was announced in 2010, I thought it was a stupid idea. A laptop built around only accessing the web? Why would anyone buy that when they can get a similarly priced Windows laptop? Fast forward several years, and Chromebooks have really hit their stride. The Chrome Web Store has really evolved with many apps also working offline (Nice try, Microsoft) and the pricing has gotten down to where I felt it originally should have been.\n\nIn my opinion, the Acer C720 is the best value currently on the market. I do 95% of my work online, so a Chromebook just makes sense. Plus, since Google owns my soul, errr, I use many Google products, it works out well. I needed something that wasn't top of the line, but could get through a small to medium work load without bogging down under the pressure, and had great battery life. The Acer C720 has exceeded all my expectations, and while I was worried if 2GB of RAM was enough, it's been just fine for my needs.\n\nPros:\n\n-Thin profile, feels solid.\n-Great keyboard for typing. Well spaced, raised keys.\n-Good, mostly accurate touchpad. Love the multi-touch functions to scroll, open a link in a new tab. Some complain about the touchpad, but I can tell you I've dealt with far worse.\n-USB 3.0 port, SD card support, HDMI out.\n-VERY quiet, barely gets warm even after hours of continuous use.\n-SSD makes boot up, opening files a breeze.\n-Fast charging.\n-Battery life lives up to the claims. I typically keep brightness around 1/3, and have gotten 6 hours on a full charge with over 20% of battery life to spare. However, like any other laptop, if you watch a lot of video, expect around half of what Acer claims.\n\nCons:\n\n-Speakers are laughable, so make sure you have good headphones handy.\n-Despite having a matte finish, the screen isn't so great in sunlight. Wish it had a higher resolution, but for $199, I can't really complain!\n-Headphone jack requires a good amount of force to snap headphones in, but I assume this is to ensure they don't easily come unplugged."}

When I saw that this was in the same price point and had a keyboard (so that it was more like a baby laptop) I decided this would be EVEN BETTER! I think I made the right call. I wanted to be able to watch movies, browse the internet, and read Kindle books away from my desktop computer. This is just perfect for all of that, and with the keyboard attached it is good for pretty much everything I use the desktop for except when I need to use MS Office or Adobe graphic programs for school, or play PC based games. So I have my desktop for schoolwork and gaming, and I have this cute little lightweight, easy to set-up and use, FAST, and portable computer for everything else I do on a computer. I am pretty happy!

Cloud printing is an amazing thing to do with this too.  I just enabled cloud printing at my desktop to which the printer is attached, and can print from anywhere in the house.  At work, the company runs on a Google system, so it's easy to log into my work email and applications any time I need to."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I am going to irritate a lot of tech savvy people.\n\nI will admit to being only mildly into the newest stuff.  I have an iPad, iPhone, Kindle, and I just lost my trusty laptop.  RIP old friend.\n\nI am short on cash at the moment, and while I use my other gadgets for most stuff...I found editing my photos, and making my digital scrapbooks very difficult on the iPad.  I made a rash decision to buy this because of the price.  Here is what you need to know:\n\n#1.  NO iTUNES!  This isn't a big deal if you don't have apple products, but I have $600 of music on my account.  I also can't sync my phone/ipad on cloud with the chromebook.\n\n#2.  No gaming.  Not a big deal for me, but of note for some people.\n\n#3.  Online word processing, Google docs.  I don't mind this feature, I actually kind of LOVE google drive, but if you are looking for an office-type program....move along.\n\n#4.  You MUST have a cloud printer IF you want to directly print from Chromebook.  You can't print without a wireless printer, and one that works with google cloud.\n\n#5.  This Chromebook never wants to auto connect to my WiFi, and when it does it doesn't work correctly.  I have to disconnect and reconnect wo my WiFi service 90% of the time I open the browser.  This is a problem.  Very buggy.\n\nIn short, Chromebook has a TON of potential.  I like it, but I don't love it.  I now wish I would have saved up a few hundred more dollars for a laptop.\n\nIF you are looking for a web browser with keys, this is fine.  If you decide to try it, do yourself a huge favor and buy Chromecast along with this chromebook.  Chromecast is an awesome feature!"}

I am a very light internet user and really only needed a basic computer- my Chromebook cannot even give me basic function. Although it does load very quickly, and has a long battery life (the only two positive things) I can almost never get on a website. If I am able to pull up  a site, like Amazon, it consistently shuts down with a sorry could not load this page. I had to turn the computer on and off 4 times just to write this review. Also if you want to use a printer you must have the computer set to WIFI prior to use because the usb ports cannot read printers.  If you want to get pics from a camera you cannot plug your device into the usb ports either, you can use an SD card but then have to find an app that actually allows you to pull up the pics. I am so disappointed in this product. I'm ordering a new laptop and giving this one to my three year old."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "Every product has some limiting facet, as microeconomics dictates, and the C720 Chromebook is no exception. There is always some sort of compromise between consumer needs and price. However, this chromebook does exceptionally well at maximizing both factors.\nI've been using this device for about 2 months, give or take, and here are some of the real world benefits:\n- Portability and battery life - you've probably heard this already if you've scrolled through the comments, but I can't get over how great both of these are\n- Can do the vast majority of my work on the Chromebook - Honestly, I came into this thinking it wouldn't be useful, as internet connection is supremely important, and none of the traditional Windows programs are available - Photoshop for one, but what I realized gradually is that I really don't use those programs all that much. I like to think that I'm a \"power user\" and I assembled a beast of a PC a couple of years ago, but now I find myself only occasionally - perhaps once or twice a week - using my fully decked out Batmobile type desktop. This $200 machine suffices in most cases - for taking notes in class, for researching for papers, for listening to Spotify, for keeping a calendar.\n\nHere are some of the downsides. I try to keep in mind the price point, but some issues are worse than others.\n- 11.6 inches is kind of small. You've heard about the screen quality, and some gripe about pixelation and poor viewing angles, but I find the screen for the most part alright. It's just really small, to me at least, coming from a 27 inch desktop monitor, and sometimes I find myself straining to read small text on the screen.\n- Whenever I download/open a document for school that happens to be in .doc or .docx format (which is always), the document opens in this thing called QuickOffice beta, which frankly sucks. Sure, it only takes, like, 5 clicks to convert it to .gdoc, but sometimes I can't find the convert button thing and I spend around half an hour messing with it so that I can edit said document, only to give up in frustration and go to good old copy-and-paste. Minor annoyance, yes, but still, an annoyance.\n\nConclusion: Buy this right now don't think just go button smash this is a better deal than FDR's"}

My wife, who did 99% of her work on the internet, always had problems with her Windows Vista laptop; you know, updates, java updates, adobe updates, anti virus updates, etc.  Programs installing toolbars without permission, changing default programs. Really was annoying for her and for me having to always fixing problems. At least twice a week. I always thought that a computer for the average person should be like and appliance; \"turn it on and it just works\".\nAfter the initial setup which took about 15 minutes she logging into her gmail account. Almost instantly all her information was there. Email, Contacts, Calendar, Pictures and all her saved favorites or bookmarks. Then I set her up with Google Cloud Print which works great. Almost two months and she hasn't asked for help once.\nThis is a function of it being a Chromebook and probably would be the same on any Chromebook.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "So far I'm totally impressed with where Google are going with Chromebooks, and particularly with this C720.  It does pretty much everything you want for everyday use, including fast browsing, playing web-page video or YouTube content, music etc.  The one exception might be writing documents, as the intention is that you use Google apps and Google Drive.  My existing '.odt' OpenOffice (LibreOffice) documents cannot be opened this way.\n\nThe C720 is lightweight and low power so it doesn't get hot and makes for comfortable laptop browsing.  The 8-hr claim for battery life is a bit optimistic if you happen to launch a few web-page videos, but several hours is realistic on a single charge.\n\nI bought it with the intention of using Crouton (chroot) to also run a Linux system in parallel.  So far it works great after installing Ubuntu \"Saucy\" with the Cinnamon desktop.  With this setup you can use ChromeOS for everyday browsing and playing media, and switch instantly to Ubuntu for development work, or to use LIbreOffice for document editing.\n\nAt $199 this is a new price point for a capable PC.  The dual-core Celeron is way more performant than some quad core Android devices (see my Minix Neo X7 review).\n\nMy only complaint is that the SD card socket is not one where the card pushes all the way in.  The card sticks out about 1cm, which could lead to damage if it were knocked.  With only 16GB of on-board flash it would've been nice to have a flush fitting SD socket."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I have friends and associates who recommended this chromebook to me, and as of yet--I think that it is a wonderful device! I conducted research before acquiring this, and although the low cost motivated me--I don't typically throw money around for kicks. This was a $200 well spent in my book because the Acer c720 is a useful tool. It would also be a huge step up from nothing for users can't afford a full fledged laptop, this to me, is revolutionary.\n\nOverview:\nIt's not necessarily a laptop replacement, but it's better than a laptop in a few ways. The main strength of the Chrome OS is that it is very difficult to hack, and it is usually intuitive and fast to use. This could replace a laptop for someone who only checks their email and does not need a computer for anything apart than web browsing. It's light, inexpensive and operates as a computer for accessing one's google drive and online resources. Everything that it does is FAST, extremely fast for a computer with 2GB.\n\nReasons why I bought it:\nI have a mac book pro, but after it experienced connectivity issues with my campus network I realized that I only used photoshop and other memory intensive programs at home. I now carry this chrome book with me because it is light, inexpensive and will allow me to upload files for class, type, check my email and visit facebook. It's a mobile computer which I use to submit assignments and can even do in browser programming for class. It's a chromebook dedicated for getting work done, if I need power I'll go home or elsewhere--with this I can't play games (a definite plus for productivity's sake) and feel motivated to work. I sometimes keep it open at home in order to check my email while I'm working on my computer. I also wanted a smallish computer that didn't run windows or android--this fit the bill.\n\nThis works for me because if necessary-- there are plenty macs and pcs on campus if I need other programs. Also it's fine for anything that I might need to do in a coffee shop.\n\nSize: Small and light. I know average sized men who use it therefore the small size is not necessarily an impediment for average use, but the small size might also make it suitable for a child. When it's in my backpack I don't even notice that it's there.\n\npositives:\n+ 7 second boot up\n+ watching videos online is great\n+ Light\n+ 200 dollars is a stellar price for its size and functionality\n+ App store has note taking apps for class\n+ decent battery life (8 hours)\n+ FAST\n\nnegatives:\n- keyboard and track pad are average (use a usb mouse)\nThe keyboard does not feel wonderful on my hands although it is certainly an attractive chiclet style board.\n- /+ offline functionality is not superb--average. Carrying a usb drive for backup might be useful for some people.\n- the slideshow part of google drive is unreliable, don't depend on it\n- Feels unsubstantial-- some people might drop it if they're not careful--it is very light, don't leave it near the edges of tables if you have a cat.\n\nImprovements:\nI would like a less \"grainy\" keyboard, a more comfortable track pad, skype and a full-ish microsoft office would also be great (but I knew this before I bought the computer). Perhaps having microsoft office would defeat the purpose of a chromebook? If it is offered in the future I'll try it though.\n\nAlso, if something were to happen to my main laptop or it were in the shop (never happened) I could still have a screen larger and more comfortable than my ipod touch. For the price--this is a wonderful machine and I plan to use it until it no longer works.\n\nRecommended for:\nteachers, students, grad students, fans of chrome os, web browsing people, travelers\n\nCase suggestions: I bought the timbuk2 quickie case for this in XS and I'll probably review it when it arrives. I already have it for my 13 inch mac, therefore if it fits--I'll be very pleased. Although it might be a 200 dollar computer, I want to protect it from bangs and scratches, as well as have room for a mouse and the power cord.\n\nI recommend finding a nice mouse to use with this chromebook.\n\n+++ I't's also possible to run Linux OS as a dual boot on this chromebook. I'll write a sentence or two about this experience when I accomplish it.\n\nFeel free to ask me any questions about this chromebook and I'll be happy to answer them."}

I had been eyeing this Chromebook for a few months but debating over it constantly, comparing it to other options like the HP Chromebook 11 and feeling disappointed that the 4gb version of the Acer was seemingly impossible to find.  I read and watched enough reviews on the HP 11 to come to the conclusion that although the screen is wonderful, the performance is mediocre.  I then read enough reviews and feedback on the C720 2gb to realize that 4gb in a Chromebook may not be entirely necessary at this point in time.  Thus I finally took the leap last week and ordered the Acer C720 2gb.  I could not be happier!  Some have complained about the lackluster screen but I actually find it quite nice, at least for my purposes of pinning to Pinterest, editing photos, and reading articles online.  I think this is excellent bang for your buck, and I know I will get a lot of use out of it."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I have owned several 7\" tablets, a Nexus 10\" tablet, and countless Windows laptops and computers. Since purchasing my C720 several months ago, it is the thing I reach for when I want to process my email, search the web, or work on any of the increasing number of web-based applications I use. In addition, I maintain several servers using the fine 2X Remote Desktop Client on my chromebook. This (I am using it right now) thing is as light and small as my Nexus 10 in its keyboard case, but so much better for everything that requires even a little typing. The only thing I still do on the tablet is watch Netflix and read e-magazines on Zinio. It is pretty much the same thing with my current laptops (and HP 12\" touchscreen model (weighs twice as much as the C270) and a 15\" i7 that I use as a backup server and for programming. I spend far more time using the chromebook than either of these other portables. So, although technically the chromebook is a supplementary device, it is the one I use most. In all fairness, I should add that my business uses Google Apps for Business, so the chromebook is a great fit in that regard, but Chrome is such a good browser that I think it would work just as well if we used Office 365 instead. I can't believe that this machine was only $200.\n\nFeatures: Time to get into the system to start using it is as fast as anyone could ask for, and less than the 15 seconds that I have read in various reviews, whether starting it cold or waking it from sleep. In that respect it feels more like my phone or tablet than my computers. The keyboard is solid with good action. I can type as fast as with any other keyboard I have. It would be nice to have a higher resolution screen, but it is good enough, and the brightness is absolutely fine. Although I really have not found it necessary, I leave a tiny 64 GB flash drive plugged in all the time, in case I suddenly need some off-line storage. Oh, that reminds me of my one gripe. The SD slot is very shallow, so if you insert an SD card, most of the card sticks out. That means it is good for copying stuff onto or off a temporarily inserted card, but you really can't leave it in there or it will surely get broken. Anyway, no biggie. I am delighted with this purchase and with the chromebook concept. It works out much better than I had imagined it would!"}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "This is a nice device.  For $200, you would be hard pressed to find something more useful for casual web surfing, facebook, email, etc.  The new Intel chip is indeed fast.  The screen and trackpad are serviceable, quite acceptable for such an inexpensive device. The screen is not as bright as some of the others, but I believe that is due to the matte finish, which reduces reflections.  However, I found the keyboard to be unacceptable.  Just poor feel, short travel, and just didn't feel right.  To be more specific, I used an online typing test back to back on the Acer and Toshiba.  On the Toshiba, I scored 63 words per minute with 98% accuracy.  On the Acer, I scored 51 WPM with 85% accuracy.\n\nIn the end I returned this for the chromebook by Toshiba.  Same speed and specs, but a much more quality device (albeit more expensive, it is well less than three hundred), especially the keyboard."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I'm in IT, so I like to explore different options for my clients.  With the end of support for XP I have a lot of companies who are looking at their options for their aging desktop replacements.  Linux is often mentioned as a replacement for MS products, but the market is fractured and no one distro seems to have risen to the top, so Apple and Google seem to be the only viable options for most mainstream users.  With new Windows based computers averaging over $700 per unit plus new software it's not an insignificant decision if you have to replace, say, 10 of your computers.\n\nI'm finding that more and more people use their computers primarily online anyway, so the \"limitation\" that Microsoft rails against in the \"Scroogled\" ads isn't particularly valid for many users; of course you can turn on \"Offline\" on your Google Drive and work on documents and email when your not connected.  With 100GB of Google Drive space for free for two years storage capacity isn't a problem for most people.  Photos can be placed on Google+ without eating into this 100GB limitation so that helps.\n\nThe computer is very fast doing most things, depending on your wireless connection.  It boots almost instantly, opens local apps like the file explorer and video player instantly, and is light and seemingly sturdy; at least it feels sturdy in spite of the plastic case.  The battery life is quite good at about 8 hours of use and it charges remarkably fast.  The screen is OK, nothing amazing, but quite readable.  With the HDMI out you can easily plug it into a large monitor or TV.  It quickly recognizes the second display and you can easily use that additional display as a mirror or as an extended display.  This is not a gaming computer, but for HD video playback it is excellent when viewed on a large display.  Movie viewing on the internal display is quite acceptable as well, although the internal speakers are not very loud and the 11\" screen needs to be held pretty close to your eyes, but not much closer than a small desktop monitor.  Headphones overcome the sound problem if you want to use them.  It's own internal display has good viewing angles from side to side, but is quite sensitive to the horizontal tilt.  However the hinge is stiff enough that the display will stay wherever you place it, so I don't find this a huge drawback, but it could be better.  The keyboard is acceptable given it's size and I don't really miss the lack of the function keys, or you can plug in an external keyboard and mouse.  The internal storage is fairly limited but a 16GB USB flash drive like the SanDisk Cruzer Fit fixes this for very little money.\n\nSo much for the physical part; how is it to use for work?  Well, pretty good, actually.  The cloud is incredibly convenient for those on the move, assuming you can find a wireless connection, which is more and more common, but most will use the Chromebook in their houses and/or offices.  The range and sophistication of apps is increasing at an incredible rate.  Many desktop functions like QuickBooks, AutoCAD, and office suites are now apps.  That's the good news, the bad news is that many of these apps are still not as sophisticated and feature rich as their desktop counterparts.  QuickBooks, for instance, doesn't let you customize your invoices nearly as much as the desktop version.  The biggest use for computers in the business world is, of course, office suites and Google Docs does a pretty good job, but still lacks many of the features of  desktop office suites.  For instance Excel or  OpenOffice Calc will let you format cells so the text can be angled, but Docs lacks that feature.  That said, Microsoft's own Office Online also lacks this feature along with other limitations.  However, the ability to work collaboratively from anywhere is great and if you work a Google Sheet or whatever, you can later use OpenOffice, LibreOffice or other software to tweak it later.\n\nSo, is the Chromebook or a Chromebox at full fledged replacement for your aging XP?  No, not quite if you require a feature rich software package(s), but it's pretty close.  I have clients with perfectly good XP machines and they plan on using those machines until the computer fails, but they also realize that as of the 8th of April they will have to unplug those machine from their network and the Internet after moving much of their data to Drive and also backing up locally.  However their investment in the computer, in MS Office 2003, and in other software will continue to be useful as an adjunct to their Chromebooks.\n\nFor under $250 this is an amazing little computer that will do most of what many people need.  Cloud computing is still in its infancy and as the power of apps increases so will the functionality of this type of computer.  One of the best parts is that you don't need a guy like me to fix your computer anymore; no more viruses, no more software updates, no more backing up your computer; it's all done by the pros, mostly at Google, so it's transparent to the end user.  Some folks worry about the security of their data, but I think that the whole business model of Google depends on them protecting your data so they invest millions into backing up the data and keeping it secure.  How much did you spend on the same functions over the last 5 years?  Less, I'll wager.\n\nBottom line; if you're tempted, I say go for it, I doubt you'll be disappointed and will probably be amazed.  This is not the only Chrome device out there; I also recommend that you look at the Toshiba Chromebook with its larger screen or the ASUS Chromebox which should be out in March."}

Better than any other touchpad I've used.\nThe keyboard is responsive and nicely sized, albeit a little shallow; the keys bottom out before you'd expect them to.\nIt does take a little bit of getting used to, but not long at all.\nThe screen is sufficient for writing and reading emails, writing word documents, and reading webpages.\n\nAs far as Chrome OS is concerned, it is what it is. Despite what you may have heard, you CAN create and edit documents without an internet connection. You can open documents from a flash drive or an external hard drive.\n\nOverall, it is a great computer. So why the missing star? The computer generates a very high-pitched whine from the right side of the computer. This is not noticeable if you are listening to music or watching a video, as it is very quiet. It does, however, make it very hard to focus if you are studying in a quiet room. The main issue here is that Acer will not do anything about it. It is clearly a hardware issue and not caused by mistreatment, but when I contacted Acer support this afternoon (2/26/2014), they would not do anything. I'm not sure if this is a common problem with these computers, or if I just got unlucky.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I bought my Acer Chromebook C720 at Best Buy for $199. I am actually writing this review on it. It is AWESOME. It's really light, and thin, so it can be stored easily. Two things I LOVE about it: the screen quality, and the sound quality. The sound is perfect. It's clear as crystal, and rivals the Dolby Digital 5.0 speakers on my Kindle Fire HD.  The Video quality is terrific, I always test that out by watching the Longmire season 2 trailer, and it was as clear as watching it on an HD TV. I'm only going to use this computer for writing, school work, music, and very little internet use (research, shopping, and the like).\n\nThe screen is 11.6 inches, as the page shows, and, as I said, the screen resolution is Perfect (1366x768, 720 pixels). Now, for such a low price you may be thinking that this is a cheap piece of crap. It's not. It's a very firm little computer. There are two USB ports, and one USB 2.0 port. The computer has no Microsoft or Apple software, just for those of you who were wondering, it's all Google, which is perfect if you (like me) work with a Google account. It does have an Intel Celeron 4.1 GHz processor. The battery life of this computer is 8.5 hours, compared to the average 4 hours on other laptops. This says that the start-up speed is 7 seconds, but I swear, it's more like 3 seconds, and the same for shut-down speed. Now, there are two little blue lights, on the front of the computer: the one on the right is if it's charging, and the one on the left is if it's on. One other thing, you don't have to push any buttons for this to turn on. All you have to do is flip it open, and pow! the screen comes on. This is one nice little laptop.\n\nOne thing I recently figured out is how to download things on to it, it has no major software, but it does the ability to download things, like picture or videos, or you can download the web address. You have to place the mouse on the picture, and tap the mousepad with two fingers, and you'll get the option to download it. You can upload those on to this computer, via jump-drive, so I do that as well. It also comes with this model's standard charging cord, being about 7-10 feet long. Now the space on these may not be so appealing to some: 16GB, or 32GB. One thing you can do, is buy a USB hub, and pug it in and use that as your storage. I have the 16GB, and I'm fine with that, because it gives me some restrictions.\n\nThis is a great little computer, especially if you need it to do schoolwork. It's light, portable, has great sound and video qualities, great battery life, and a very good processor. I would definately recommend this to any one needing a small computer, or wanting a good one at a low price. You can't beat this laptop's bang-for-it's-buck."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "Had to edit my review. Still really like the idea of a chromebook however i'm experience problems with mine. It randomly shuts down. I've posted in googles chromebook forum but haven't gotten an answer that helps. I've ran a Chrome OS recovery which installs a fresh copy of Chrome OS on your computer. It shut down 5 mins after that. I thought maybe it was overheating on my lap - covering the exhaust port and fan but it shut down on a table a couple days ago and last night in the middle of a movie. Both time the vents were completely clear. Have read 2 other reviews that have this problem. Might just be faulty hardware and I got an unlucky one. Not sure but I will have to take this back. Don't know if I will purchase another.\n\nThis is my first chromebook. If you know what a chromebook/Chrome OS is capable of will not be disappointed.\n\nI've been using it for a couple days now so I'll give you a breakdown of what I like about it\n\nScreen- 11.6 is alot smaller than I'm used too. That being said its not a bad trade off for the portability of this device. Its a TN screen so colors are not that great but also not bad, I've seen 400-500 dollar laptops with worse screens. I compared the chromebook with the ISP panel and it was so much nicer of a screen but I did not like that chrome book. I actually like the matte screen. My last 2 laptop were glossy so I thought i might not like this one but thats not the case. Remember the price of this laptop I can't complain at all about the screen\n\nHdmi out - I've hooked this up to my 55\" samsung tv via hdmi. The picture was amazing. Just make sure you don't choose mirror displays. that will send the 1366x768 image to the tv. Choose the other setting and it will send a full 1080p signal to your screen. I tested playing movies from either usb port, the sd card, and the actual hard drive on the computer and all worked perfectly.\n\nWebcam- just average. In good lighting its a decent image. Medium light starts to get grainy. Low light pretty bad.\n\nAudio- sounds great with headphones, speaker volume is more than enough with my Grados. Built in speakers are very good as well, better than my last 2 laptops which is odd since the speakers here are on the bottom.\n\nBattery life - have been getting 7-8 hours just as advertised. I really find this incredible, my past laptops were 3 hours at most\n\nwifi- works great. I needed an ethernet port which this did not have. I purchased a usb to ethernet adapter from amazon. It was cheap and works perfectly. Tried it in both usb ports and is automatically detected and worked in both.\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Sabrent-USB-2-0-to-Network-10-100Mbps-Ethernet-Adapter/dp/B00BJOZNV2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Sabrent USB 2.0 to Network 10/100Mbps Ethernet Adapter</a>\n\nsd/usb ports - all work and quickly, dont' have any usb 3.0 devices to see how much quicker the usb 3 is.\n\nkeyboard- i like the small keyboard. can reach any button easily while typing. doesn't feel cheap. the full screen button and the buttons around it are a little \"clicky\". There is some flex in that area of my laptop which causes that sound. If I push down slight on the plastic above those keys they sound just liek the rest. The tiny flex in the plastic is what is causing the sound , the keys work fine.  Some buttons are gone from a regular laptop or keyboard but there are short cuts to each of these missing keys. Just have to look them up - example no delete button but alt+backspace functions as a delete button.\n\nTrackpad- is sensitive and responsive. Click feels solid, but i find that i really click anymore just tap it. Since the laptop is small the track pad is on the small side. Sometimes when I'm scrolling down I run out of track pad. I just have get used to it and two finger scroll a little quicker and then it brings me to the bottom of the pages i'm reading.\n\nSo for 199 I really think this is an amazing machine. If you know what Chrome OS is capable of then you won't be disappointed with this.  At first I didn't know how I would manage without downloading the programs I have on windows but it seems in this day there is a web based program for everything you need to do.\n\nMy only issue is Toshiba just came out with a chromebook CB35-A3120. It has a 13.3 inch screen (supposedly better colors, glossy screen). Two 3.0 usb ports. It is 279 plus tax so its almost 50% more than this model.  I've not seen one in a store yet but I might consider getting that instead depending on when I see one in person."}

The time it takes to be ready to use is incredible, just a mere few seconds.\nAlso the operating speed is very good, thanks to the fast CPU and the SSD (instead of a HDD).\n\nKEYBOARD\nI have one complaint about it: the KEYBOARD.\nIt's only OK. Which means, it is not bad, but it is far from being good.\nIt does not have definite pressure points; you can't feel whether you've pushed the keys down or not.\nSo the keyboard is definitely not good.\n\nMOUSE\nOne more thing you might come across (but this is related to Chrome OS, not this device):\nIf you like fast MOUSE cursor movements, i.e. you are used to that a small mouse movement causes big cursor movement on the screen there is a high chance that your usual mouse will not fit.\nYou have to buy a mouse with at least 1600 DPI sensitivity. I don't recommend Logitech mice since most of them have 1000 DPI and Logitech even doesn't state the sensitivity of their mice.\nI've managed to buy a cheap no-name Chinese wireless mouse for around $15 which is a 1600 DPI wireless mouse and it works like a charm; it is sensitive and fast enough, and very responsive like a wired one; there is not any lag stemming from the wireless operation.\n\nSo you have to be sure that the sensitivity of the mouse is at least 1600 DPI. If it is higher that is not a problem -- in the Chrome settings you can decelerate the speed. It's just can't be set to be fast enough with a 1000 DPI mouse."}

I bought this to replace a laptop, but it appears to have been a waste of money. I am not able to open most .pdf documents or .rtf documents (both very common file types). I am a college student, and many of my assignments are assigned via Blackboard. This chromebook won't even allow me to open up assignment files. Additionally, it doesn't support flash. One of my classes is online, and this useless piece of technology cannot even log into a live \"wimba\" classroom. If you want a simple, clean machine to surf the web...this may work out for you. Don't, however, assume (as I did) that it could handle even the most elementary tasks though. It will disappoint you every time.\nUpdate: This chromebook has gotten progressively worse. All chromebook programs are essentially browser \"extensions\". There are a wide variety of fairly decent extensions out there, but this \"computer\" is entirely too unstable to run more than one background app at a time. I am constantly getting error messages about crashing extensions. Good concept, poor execution.

So initially she was a bit 'disappointed' - however now, after the first month of use she really likes the speed of starting the system up, the availability of features via apps and is not looking for anything else on that unit - of course some compromises she had to accept, being an Apple user for long.\nThe quality is decent - not quite the Apple level, but neither is the price - so for this year I hope the Acer will suffice and we see what might come later.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "Update 5/15/2014:\nMy original review is still posted below.  I just wanted to update my review, as things have changed for the better and I want to be fair.  I have changed the rating from 3 stars to 5 stars, as this is one of the best technology purchases I have made in quite some time.\n\nI did end up returning the Chromebook I purchased in February, as I couldn't resolve the wifi connection issue(see original review below).  After a few weeks without it, I began to miss it.  I spent an hour or two reading the forums again, and found what I thought might be a solution to the wifi connection issue.  So I ordered another Chromebook from Amazon.  I signed into my wireless router and found that the firmware hadn't been updated for over three years.  Did the router update and checked settings(switched Chromebook connection to 5 Ghz band - my dual band router has 2.4 and 5 Ghz), and the Chromebook hasn't dropped my wifi connection once.  I gave up on the music and apps, figure I don't really need them on this device.  I didn't try the SD card slot either.  Again, not something I really need.  I use this fantastic device for everything internet except for MMO gaming(that's what my laptop is for).  Highly recommend for anyone who just needs a quick device for things like e-mail, YouTube, online banking/bill paying, social media, etc.  I'm not usually a fan of touchpads, but this is the best touchpad I've ever used - first time I don't want to use a mouse.  You can't beat this device, especially at this price.  I've had it for about a month now, and have absolutely no complaints.  Love it!\n\nOriginal Review:\n\nPros:\n - Nice web browsing at great speed\n - VERY quick startup\n - Amazing battery life and charging (better than I expected)\n - SD card slot (also a con, see below)\n - Good price\n\nCons:\n - Doesn't use Google Play Store apps (Chrome Store - big difference)\n - No user manual included\n - SD card doesn't insert all the way into machine\n - SD card not always recognized\n\nNow for a little explanation.  The web browsing is nice at a fast speed, even seems faster than my Intel i7 laptop.  I was thrilled that it has an SD card slot, but even that seems to work only when it wants to.  Transferring files takes A LOT of time.  There is also a problem with maintaining wifi connection.  This seems to happen when the battery gets down to about 50%.  I have restarted my router and the issue is still there.  If this issue isn't resolved, I will be returning it.  A big disappointment for me was that it doesn't use Play Store apps, as I was hoping to play some of my favorite games.  The Chrome Store doesn't offer many games that interest me that are also available offline.  Another big disappointment is that the Google Play Music app (pre-installed) is a nightmare when trying to add my music to my library.  Apparently it requires downloading another app (Music Manager), but there are four different versions of this app to download, and I don't know which one I need for my Chromebook.  That's another issue: no real support site(s) that are helpful enough to guide a Chromebook novice such as myself through tasks that should be pretty basic.  I understand that the Chrome OS is updated frequently and this makes a regular \"User Guide\" impractical,  but something explaining the basics (beyond \"plug it in and turn it on\") should be included.\n\nAs an Amazon Prime member, I bought a Kindle Fire, but the web browsing crapped out on me within six months of purchase, so I don't want to buy another Kindle.  I guess this will work fine for web browsing, checking e-mail, YouTube, and watching Amazon Prime content (tested and works well), but I was hoping for something with which I could also use to play games and listen to my music.  I guess this is not that device."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "There are just a couple of things I don't like; one is the mouse pad which doesn't have a separate button so I often accidentally zoom in on google maps (since I have one finger on the \"button\" and one on the other hand \"pointing\"). The other thing is I almost always have the audio \"headphone\" jack plugged into my home stereo, and I am startled by a loud buzz when the book goes to sleep or turns on, or at other times (it happens fairly frequently) and is really unsettling. And I guess a third thing is I do have to limit the number of tabs (pages) open, or I get the \"he's dead Jim\" message. On the whole though, I'm very happy with it. I use it to read, often when it isn't plugged in, and the battery life seems fine. The screen isn't nearly as good as my 15\" laptop, but it's so light and easy to travel with (around the house or out-and-about), I am really glad to have it. The keyboard is fine, only the mouse pad, lacking keys which aren't also part of the pointer surface, is the only thing I'm having to struggle with (and the loud buzz)."}

If you're expecting the highest level of features and/or hardware, then go spend $500+ on a different machine. BUT, if you're looking for something to use quite often to browse on Facebook, email, and just general web surfing for minimal cost, then this is the perfect little machine. It's basically a browser on steriods. It's really fast and snappy because the operating system is so light that it doesn't take much to power it. The battery life easily holds 8-9 hours of solid battery life.\n\nWhen setting it up, the track pad seemed a little jittery and glitchy, but after I set all the settings and increased the sensitivity on it, it works just fine now. I think it might have to do with the software setting itself up for the first time so it takes more resources. I have had MANY tabs open at once and it doesn't show any signs of lag. For the money, this is a great little machine and it's light so you can take it with you anywhere."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I bought my C720 about 6 weeks ago (local purchase), and haven't regretted the purchase in any way.  It does the job expected, in a very competent fashion.\n\nI bought it after an in-store trial of 3-4 different Chromebooks.  This one was clearly faster, snappy compared to molasses (the other models) at loading a complex web site.  I still feel like I never wait for it to do something.  Now, I'm not opening more than 2 windows at a time, nor do I expect this to be a high end gaming device or a monster calculation machine.  I bought it because I got tired of 5 minute start times on my other machines.  I've got two Win 7 laptops that take forever to be ready for use.  The Chromebook is absolutely ready in 5-7 seconds, every time.\n\nThe battery lasts a very long time.  In my typical short daily uses (5 minutes here, 20 minutes there), it seems to last about a week.\n\nChrome has opened every web site successfully.  No problems.  I had no problems using Logmein to remotely access a work computer (but with their recent company issues I have switched to VPN on Win 7.  I haven't tried VPN on the Chromebook).\n\nI was surprised there wasn't a direct WiFi link to my printer.  The free Cloud Printing from Google works fine...perhaps a few seconds more delay reaching the printer than my local WiFi would give.\n\nMostly I'd say the take home lesson is that you turn it on (quickly!) and it just works.  Fun and quick.  The only way you could go wrong is to buy it expecting it to run Win 8 or Windows applications.  Or to to handle 5 programs at the same time.\n\nOh yes, the build quality is better than I expected from Acer.\n\nThe Acer C720 is a steal at the price."}

Several of my students are now using Chromebooks and I need to be able to support them. This is an excellent device! It has a very responsive keyboard, bright and very clear screen, in fact I can't tell much of a difference between this and my iPad 2. It is very fast to come up and even faster to shut down. It also responds fast to web accesses. It's got a great looking case that doesn't smudge up with fingerprints. But one of the biggest surprises was the number of useful apps available free from the Chromebook store. I am still exploring many of these but it seems I have found more apps useful to me available here than I actually do on the iPad, although I am not much for games or social networking. I much appreciate having a real keyboard rather than a virtual one or one that has to be carried around separately or in a case. I compared specs and reviews on Samsung and HP 11 before buying and one reviewer found this faster than either of those. Glad I read that review because I saved $50 over the Samsung and $80 over the HP! I was tempted by the avante garde appearance of the HP but I am very pleased with the Acer 720 and will be recommending it to students who need a very light weight, easy to use and economical computer for web, essay writing, and general purpose records-keeping. I highly recommend this to anyone with similar needs. You cannot go wrong with this, and it would be excellent for middle and high school use, much more suited to student use at those levels than the iPads that the Los Angeles Unified School District is currently issuing to 655,000 students at a cost of over $1 billion. This device could meet that purpose for less than 1/3 of the cost, and it would meet that purpose better."}

The BSOD (blue screen of death) had become a daily occurrence, so I finally let it stay dead.\n\nI replaced it with a tablet which I thought would be sufficient since I'm now retired.  But there were limitations - small screen (OK for watching videos & playing games) and no SD card slot.  I hated the virtual keyboard, so I purchased a Bluetooth keyboard, and that helped a lot.  But I really got tired of having to use my sister's laptop to upload photos from my camera plus having constant eyestrain, so I ordered this Chromebook.\n\nSetup was quick & easy!  Just log in to your google account and enter your internet password.  I adjusted a few settings for my personal preference, but that was it!  I had already been using Google Drive, so all my docs were already in the cloud.\n\nThere are numerous reviews here that detail the technical specs, so I won't rehash those.

Unacceptably for a modern machine that is supposed to give you the \"best of Chrome\", the HP Chromebook 11 has the same processor as the Samsung from 2012 and the performance is not much better.\n\nTrust me - nothing is more frustrating than waiting for websites to load, and a close second pet peeve is poor performance, lagginess, and abrupt jerkiness when navigating around a page. You will get none of that on the C720. In this day and age, I need the internet to work immediately and reliably. The use of the older ARM processor is a huge oversight by HP and something they shouldn't have skimped on.\n\nThe Samsung and the HP definitely win in the looks dept., but the C720 isn't an ugly computer by any means. People moan about its design, but it's quite easy on the eyes when you see it in person. Pictures don't do it justice. The metallic gray is pleasing and the shiny bezel around the display is reminiscent of Apple's design choice, which I prefer to the matte black bezel of the Chromebook 11. The C720 is also very light and feels quite sturdy in the hand despite being made of lower cost materials. The keyboard is good enough to use, even though the keys do feel slightly \"mushy\", but they haven't caused me any significant errors or slowdowns so far.\n\nYou really can't complain of much when spending $199 on a computer. If you're looking for something fast, light, and can last all day, throw your chips on the Acer C720. You will not be disappointed."}

However, after using this thing for a while now I am thoroughly pleased. The web browsing on this thing is impeccable and, in fact, loads faster than my family's $2500 mac desktop. I recommend this to any school who wants great research tools for their student or to anyone looking for an awesome way to access the web."}

I use it primarily for playing card games and doing jigsaw puzzles while watching TV however it does much more.  I would give it 5 stars except it does get a little warm but not to the point where it is uncomfortable in my lap.  The email program is better than expected.  It was simple to set up and network.  It is speedy on the internet.  I haven't used the word program yet as I am a little uncomfortable with the cloud but I'm sure I will eventually use it.  Change is hard for me and I still don't like the touchpad so I use a wireless mouse with it and that is somewhat inconvenient because there isn't much room on the keyboard for it....solved that problem by placing a clipboard over the keys.  I haven't timed how long it goes without charging but it is much longer than my laptop.  I have found no problems with it.  The price was right.  It is light in weight. Yes, I would recommend it."}

There's a single point about the size of a quarter towards the bottom right edge the \"spiders\" out across the screen. Because I had NOT dropped, stepped-on, flexed the screen or otherwise damaged the screen, I took it back to Best Buy, which is the store I purchased it from.  The rep told me it was impossible for the screen to crack without having some external force. There was no use arguing with the guy so I brought home the little Acer and connected it to an external monitor. I can purchase a replacement screen for $60.00, and replacing the screen is a snap, but still, how can a screen crack without it being damaged?  I still really like the little computer but I'm a little less impressed with its quality.\n\n---\n\n(ORIGINAL REVIEW)  It works and it works almost flawlessly.  No, it won't install Office or Adobe products, but, it not designed for these products or people needing these products. If you need lightening fast access to the Web, your Google Docs or even to view Word Docs, this machine is perfection. It's almost \"instant on\" and that's a brilliant improvement over any machine I've owned. The screen is small but adequate for it's designed purposes. Watch  Netflix, <Check>, Browse Web, <Check>, Email, <Check>, FaceBook, <Check>, Draft a lengthy research paper, <No check>, but you could do it.\n\nThe battery is insanely long-lived, the machine is cool as a cucumber on a warm Florida day and keyboard and track pad are fine.  This is not a Porche, Rolls Royce or even a Lexus, it's a Honda Accord.  It looks good, gets the job done and saves you a ton of money.\n\nIf you understand and like the Chromebook concept, it's a no-brainer. If you neither understand or appreciate Chromebooks, then please look elsewhere."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I'll keep this short and sweet, as there are plenty of well written and long reviews here already, which I did read before buying (as I never used a Chromebook before) and I would recommend you do as well.  Simply put, I bought this because I am currently a college student and I have a Lenovo G780 17\" laptop as a desktop replacement in my dorm.  It was a little too big for me to lug around to my classes everyday, so I took a gamble and purchased this as a replacement.  There are apps for almost everything.  If you need to use Office, use SkyDrive and you can make Word, Excel, and PowerPoint online for free.  I strongly recommend this product.  The screen is very clear, the battery lasts very long, and the touchpad is pretty responsive.  The only design issue I have with it is that the speakers are on the bottom of the device, but that's just me.  The sound it still good, just not great when I sit it on my lap, as my leg absorbs the sound.  Overall, I do not regret buying this, and I would definitely buy it again.  It's a great deal."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I work in technology and have several high-end custom laptops running Linux and Windows and have very little patient for computers that don't perform very well.  I have been wanting a Chromebook for some time but wasn't sure what to expect.  I was really impressed with my Acer tablet that was low cost but clearly a solid device, so when Acer came out with this Chromebook with the new Haswell processor I decided to jump on it.  I care more about performance than looks so I went with the Acer since it was getting good performance reviews.  I was also looking for a another small and light computer that I could take with me when I travel for work that I could use for my personal use - I like to keep personal and work usage completely separate.\n\nI have been using this laptop for several weeks now and I am very impressed.  This is now my favorite computer!  I did upgrade the SSD drive to a 64Gb drive which seemed to improve the performance and I have been pleased every since.  As Google says, it is instant on and off so you never wait.  The battery life seems to last forever.  It far exceeds any other laptop I have every had, especially at this extremely low weight.  I love that TPM is build into the platform for heavy encryption of the storage and I like having separate profiles between users.\n\nIt is a shift to have your data and applications come from the cloud but it works and completely integrates with my phone, a Samsung Note 3.  Once I got familiar on how to use my Chromebook and Google tools, I decided to move all of my personal content to my Google Drive - all of my pictures, documents, music, etc.  I encrypt sensitive information with Boxcryptor on my Google Drive.  This works well on my Chromebook and my phone.  I am now using my C720 for doing just about everything I use a computer for - creating and editing documents, editing and posting pictures, doing video calls and messaging with Google Hangouts. watching movies, listening to music and more.\n\nBy the way, the wireless radio on this laptop is amazing.  I have not seen another laptop beat it in speed tests on my wireless network - this includes custom gaming laptops with special wireless cards, a Macbook pro, iPads, phones, etc.  Only my Samsung Note 3 with support of 802.11ac comes close.  I couldn't believe it at first but test after test showed the same result.  Simply amazing especially at this price point!  I am not sure how Acer did this.\n\nWi-Fi access in Google sponsored locations is automatic as well.  I noticed that I got instance access in some locations without hitting the captive portal page and having to go through a registration process to get Internet access.  That is pretty cool.  When I travel, I like this laptop to my mobile hotspot on my phone and I am connected whenever I want to be.\n\nThere are times when I am using unsecured public Wi-Fi that I like to get my access through a VPN tunnel so I set up my Chromebook to use a L2TP VPN tunnel.  You can set it to automatically connect to the VPN server once Wi-Fi is connected and this works very reliably.\n\nI also use this laptop with an external mouse, keyboard and monitor in docking mode.  I was even more surprised to see this laptop drive the display on my laptop while also driving my external display that is a 1080p monitor through HDMI.  You can extend the display or mirror your laptop display.  Either way works very well and I have never had even one issue, which is rare.  I have seen Macbooks and Windows computers choke on driving external displays more often than they should.\n\nWatching video on this laptop has been a very good experience as well.  I watch Netflix, YouTube & Google movies and my own video files with no issue on my laptop or with an external display.  The video is very smooth.  By the way, any Google movie you buy can also be watched through YouTube.\n\nThis laptop will also reach multiple file systems on USB drives.  I have tried Windows and Linux partition formations without issue.\n\nIn summary, this is a solid device from Acer.  This laptop will spoil you and delivers far more value that most laptops several times more expensive.  It is easy to use by design but it is very functional for a wide range of users.  I am recommending this laptop to everyone looking for laptop.  There are some new ways of doing things in the Google Chromebook model but I think that is an easy transition to make and will greatly simplify your life once you do!  I also suggest looking at some of the Chromebook books on tips and tricks.  That really helped me in my transition as well."}

I find the C720 thin and sleek, and I like the graphite gray color that gives off a titanium vibe. Sure, the HP Chromebook 11 is prettier but you're foremost buying a computer here, not a piece of sculpture. As for the \"Jeez, you can (unlike the HP 11)  see the slotted vents and screws . . . and EVERYTHING on the bottom\" Yeah, you can. I know, because I checked. And that's the last time I looked down there. Seriously, how much time do you spend looking at the underside of a laptop? Why is this even an issue?\n\nHonestly, for me the \"refined industrial chic\" aesthetic of this little Acer is a plus.\n\nAs for performance, it's, well, amazing. I find both the screen and speakers more than adequate. The screen, once you find the right angle on your lap or desk (which requires all of about 2 seconds) has rich colors, solid contrast and color saturation. I watched a couple of Netflix videos on it yesterday, also several YouTube vids, and they all looked . . . fine. No, not an Apple retina display. But it didn't cost me $1,200 either.  And, with an IMac G5 desktop and iPad, I am, and have always been, a Mac guy. And I still find this Acer immensely impressive and fun.\n\nThe speakers, though expectedly thin on bass, are clear and resonant, though I do most of my listening via earbuds through which the Acer delivers superb, rich, and nuanced audio.\n\nBut mainly, the C720 is SO fast. Pages load up almost as fast as you click on the link: BamBamBam. Even the laudatory reviews of the HP Chromebook 11 concede that its processor is paleolithic compared to that of the Haswell-driven Acer.\n\nNow, when it comes to computers, I am a certifiable cyber cretin. But within 10 minutes of unboxing the C720, I was zipping around with ease and confidence. Sampling videos, creating music playlists on Spotify, loading new apps from the store such as Planetarium, Pandora, and Old Time Radio, among others. There are still some tasks I need to figure out how to do, but I am now in my third day of use and am hugely enjoying my C720 experience.\n\nFor $199, it's hard to even imagine a better, or more delightful, or more complete, package."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I find the Acer C720 Chromebook is the best combination of price, quality, speed, and battery life among the several Chromebooks on the market. It serves a introduction to computing for new users and as a good traveling computer for PC users. Acer and YouTube have many tutorials on the features and use of Chromebooks. Check these out before you buy.\n\nTablets and Chromebooks are similar in a lot of ways. They are primarily for online use, they have very short boot up times, they don't drain much power in standby mode, and the price range is about the same. My Acer C720 boots in less than 10 seconds and goes several days in standby without a recharge. and cost $200. My Nexus 10 cost $400. Both tablets and Chromebooks require much less upkeep than a PC, for things like backup and virus protection. And the complexity is much reduced from that of a PC. There are fewer options, so there is less confusion in learning how to accomplish the tasks you want to do on a computing device. And, every hacker is not trying to download stuff on your device that you don't want. So when you evaluate a Chromebook, compare it more to a tablet rather than a PC.\n\nWhere Chromebooks and tablets differ is in productivity. Tablets have a touchscreen and apps which are convenient for consuming information, but the browsers are substandard compared to a PC, and there is no real keyboard for data entry. In that respect, Chromebooks are much more like a PC. For new users contemplating buying a PC, a Chromebook is a much shorter path to learning how to use a PC, than a tablet. For less than half the price of a PC a Chromebook is a cheap and easy way to get into computing, and it may be all that a lot of people will ever need.\n\nThe Chromebook can be set up to do the same things you can do on a PC with the Google Chrome browser. However, it's not limited to Google applications, only applications that work within the Chrome browser. Any web application that works in the PC Chrome browser works on a Chromebook. For example, Microsoft SkyDrive, Netflix, Spotify, Pandora, RSS readers, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, gmail, Outlook mail, etc, all work in the Chrome browser so they also work on a Chromebook just like they work on a PC. This is not true of tablets. Tablet apps are configured differently from PC applications.\n\nIf you're using the Chrome browser now on your PC you know that it has many extensions like Add This sharing, Readability, Hangouts, free Google phone calling, etc. These are all available on the Chromebook. As a PC user, my Chromebook fits my particular needs much better than my Nexus 10 tablet. About the only thing I use my Nexus 10 for now are things like Hangouts, and other casual activities that don't require input."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I bought the acer c720 vice the samsung and hd becuase of its haswell architecture and the speed of the system. It is a very good system with instant on capability, long battery life and with the google chrome, a secure web browser which is a must especially these days. The unit doesnt seem as solidly built as the samsung, but overall its a pretty decent little computer that has apps which try and emulate the windows standards. It doesnt have a floppy disk drive, but it does have 2 usbs and a scandisk drive. Sotrage space is limited, but you could always just buy a heavy gb usb or if you're so inclined, cloud you basic info and usb/backup your more pertinent info. The keyboard is missing a shift key as well as a return, but after about 5-7 minutes you get used to the keyboard, theres also a pretty decent finger mousepad with other options as well, either way for 200 dollars you cant beat it and if you're practical, it will do 90% of what a full-fledged laptop will do at a much lower price point. i woulddefinately recommend over an apple type computer just based on price alone if buying for your kids school."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "Im a grad student in the humanities, which means I do a lot of word processing. I have a first gen MacBook from 2006 and a late 2012 Mac mini with a 21.5 Dell Ultrasharp monitor. At 5.2 pounds, the MacBook is a pain to travel with - whether to a cafe for some light work or through airports. I looked into a Chromebook for a cheap option for writing on-the-go. Sure, I don't have full access to Zotero, but working on Google Docs is perfect for allowing me to produce first drafts of dissertation work that I can refine on my Mac mini setup once at home.\n\nI initially bought a Samsung Chromebook because it was the lightest one available at 2.4 pounds. Wifi ran painstakingly slow on it; I felt I was back in the days of dial-up. For a wifi-based device, that was a severe problem (and a documented one if you google it), so I returned it and got the Acer C720.\n\nMany reviews complain about the C720s ugly design, but it simply looks like a generic laptop. The blackish grey color feels sleek and impressive. Although I can feel the .3 ounce difference in weight from the Samsung Chromebook, it is definitely much easier to carry around than my 5 pound MacBook. After two months with this Chromebook, Ive reached a point where I prefer starting my writing projects on Google Docs - whether on my Chromebook or my Mac mini. Overall, this is a wonderful tool in my device ecosystem, especially for its price."}

I used to have Sony VAIO as well and when I compare the display of that 3 year old laptop with this laptop then chromebook stills looks poor quality and that is not problem for me. Keyboard is good.

It also has stereo speakers and sound quality is good. There are two USB ports and one on the left is USB3. The data tansfer from USB3 harddrive to internal SSD was superfast.

No noise.  Both my wife and I have logins.  Just click on your name, put in your Google password and there you are.  Amazing unit.  It just sits there, quietly.  Runs every web page, Netflix, Hulu, Amazon.  We have concentrated on doing everything on the cloud.  My wife does volunteer accounting and membership list work for the county library.  Fortunately, they are smart enough to use Google docs and spreadsheets (BTW-why would you buy Microsoft office when Google Docs is Free?).\nThis is the best unit you can possibly buy-IF you do not need programs  For example, I have a software program for converting VHS to DVD. Can't use it.  I also have a full software program for our printer so I can scan, etc.  Can't use it, although the Chromebook prints to the printer fine.  I also am using Turbotax and Quicken for the last time.  Once I change to on-line that will not be a problem.  Oddest yet, I have Dish network with the Sling Player built in.  Won't work???  The sling works fine on my computer, tablet and even phone, but not on the Chromebook.  I am assuming (hoping) that will be fixed.  We are snowbirds and spend 2 1/2 months in the desert.  DishAnywhere is a godsend for us.\nIf you are buying a second computer, or do not need programs, a Chromebook is the best possible solution.

I now took time to write a review for it.\n\nFirst up - it is a bit unfair to not only the buyer but also to Google/Acer to market this as a \"laptop\". It is not a laptop - it was never meant to be.\n\nThis device is meant for those who spend most of the time working on the Internet and can use Google Docs as a tool rather than traditional Office suites.\n\nGood stuff:\n\n1. It is super light-weight\n2. It boots up very quickly thanks to its SSD Hard Drive\n3. Google gives you 100GB of Cloud storage\n4. The keyboard is very responsive\n5. Since the entire OS is the browser itself and you pretty much exist on the cloud for your computing needs - the chances of malware, viruses etc. are minimal\n6. It is silent - it does not get hot - probably consumers minimum power - which means it is a fairly energy efficient too.\n7. The best part - the battery - it goes on and on with a single charge.\n\nActually, that is all I can think of. The Chromebook is a great device for those on the move and like their tablet. It is definitely a more productive device than a Tablet. A tab is pretty much just for entertainment. This easily trumps that as you can do actual quick work on this. This will never be your primary computing device - you will need your regular PC for that. But as a secondary or tertiary device, this is nothing short of brilliant."}

This machines performance blows the HP chromebook out of the water.\n\nOk now that I have gotten that out of the way I can go into further detail. I own a very capable smartphone, A couple of tablets and an Acer Aspire S7 ultrabook. Now manyy might wonder..\"Why would I get this chromebook when I have a very capable ultrasexy ultracompact Windows machine??\" Well my S7 suffered an accident and is off getting repaired. I am a student and needed something to fill the void. For 200 bucks I figured why not. Did my research and played with a few and realized that this could work.\n\nAs far as look and feel go. They could have done better. Can't imagine it costing much more to improve the look and feel but it is not bad and does look professional. It is thin and light.\n\nTouchpad is good. A little jumpy when compared to a 1000 system but I am surprised it is even this good.\n\nScreen is not as good as the HP chromebook but it ain't bad either. Has good brightness and is anti glare.\n\nKeyboard is acceptable, key travel is a bit shallow but it is about what I expect in a 200 dollar computer.\n\nComes with an HDMI, and 2 USB ports pus an SD reader. Can't really beat that for $200\n\nPerformance is where this thing shines. Handles multiple tabs in chrome easily. Has no problem streaming music or videos. I am very impressed. Hard to notice any real difference when compared to my computer that costs 7 times more. And since it's not running a heavy OS it boots up so fast. I was sort of shocked how quickly it was up and running on the first boot. Gave me the impression that it was used or something lol.\n\nSoftware is what it is. You should know what you are getting yourself into before buying this thinking it will be a traditional PC or Mac. I am heavily invested into Googles ecosystem so this was sort of a no-brainer for me.\n\nTo sum up..I am in love. For me this accomplishes 90% of everything I do on my Windows systems. I really feel like this is the best deal in tech. Seems too good to be true. Just a few years ago those netbooks were more expensive and the performance was a joke. Now Google found a way to make a cheap laptop that works. As a student I can say this is a perfect match. It is very portable and the performance is perfect. If I need to quickly whip it out to take notes, it works without a hitch. Google Docs is sufficient for most of my needs and if I need more Office365 works just fine."}

Screen captures, importing images, reworking the format of the presentation all worked without a hitch. And the way Google Drive is set up, when you save it's seamless and identical to saving on a local drive.\n\nBattery life: You can easily get 8 hours from this machine, and if you are careful with your browser tabs and screen brightness you can easily get 10-11 hours. And yes, it charges fully in 1 1/2 - 2 hours as promised.\n\nInflight Wifi passes:  12 of these free with purchase. Wow!\n\nCons:\n\nThis technology is right on the edge for business use, so some things are still works in process.\n\nVPN: My company's VPN doesn't work with the Chromebook. Not a total surprise but would be nice to use this in public places with a secure connection.\n\nWifi: In the course of one travel day I connected fine to 2 networks but was denied access to 2 others. Not surprising that a machine that's essentially a browser can't support all possible configurations, but slows you down since this is meant to be an always connected machine.\n\nSo if you keep in mind this is a fairly new technology, and if what you want to achieve with it will be mostly online work, you won't be disappointed.\n\n** 2 year update **  : machine still chugging along like new.

The pad itself seemed to hover over the rest of the keyboard, as if it weren't secured into the frame or maybe the plastic shell was warped. I would push on it and the entire keyboard area would flex. The pad was smooth and flat, but when i would drag my finger across it the cursor would kinda float between points. Or it would jerk from place to place. It would not move smoothly anywhere. It was so bad that I couldn't even click on buttons because the cursor had a mind of its own. At first I thought it was maybe my finger, so I tried different angles and I even tried dampening my finger to get more friction on the pad. Then I got my wife to try using it.

I have issues with the Bluetooth - it's not picking finding or pairing with my Jambox from Jawbone. And a bigger issue - the headphone jack isn't working. So there is no way I can listen to music/movies without everyone hearing.\n\nI wish the operating system were easier to use in diagnosing hardware settings. I'm used to Windows Control Panel, but there doesn't seem to be much of that in the \"settings\" in the bottom right corner, even the Advanced settings.

As the product description indicates, it is made to use only google programs. What this means is that you will not be able to use Word or any Office program and in addition you will be limited in terms of the types of files you can open on the computer. It would seem that Google makes its money through this product by forcing you to purchase apps to make the machine functional. At the end of the day, you may not be saving any money and you may be purchasing a big hastle."}

You won't be able run and install the .exe files that you used to do on Windows, you can only go to the chrome web store and download the program from there. So basically, you will have to view it as a tablet.\n\nWhen I use the tablet, I use browser to suffer on internet for most time, and have multiple tabs open for different pages. But my tablet is not responsive in switching tabs, and not convenient to tap on tab due my fat finger. The chromebook has much better performance (I purchased the model with 2GB RAM), and is easier for me to type with the physical keyboard. I have other powerful PC to handle the heavy loading task, therefore, this is exactly what I am looking for to the tablet alternative.\n\nAlthough everything about chromebook is based on chrome web browser, it has something extra. You can check the battery life, add input method for other language, do video chat, have bluetooth connection, wi-fi connection. To see if you will like it, install the Google chrome web browser on your PC and try to the your daily computer works on it.\n\nOn the hardware side, I think the build quality is decent. The keyboard feels solid, the touch pad is sensitive, wi-fi is stable. However, the screen view angle is limited. If you are looking for a computer for tablet usage, and you can find the app you need on the chrome web store, you will be happy with this chromebook."}

The battery life on the C720 has been excellent. I average around 8 hours of battery life every day that I use it, and it's done everything I've needed it to do - being reasonable, of course.\n\nA small complaint that I do have, is that I very frequently get a high-pitched whining noise that sounds like it's coming from the fan. Generally speaking, the sound is low enough that it's not TOO distracting, but there are occasions to where I may be in a lecture hall where it's very quiet, and that's when the sound begins to stand out a bit. This noise has been a consistent occurrence, but does not detract from it's original intents and purposes.\n\n4 stars overall, 5 if just didn't have that noise problem."}

The acer meanwhile came with an incredibly fast intel haswell processor and a long battery life of 8.5 hours.\nI received the acer c720 directly from acer(refurbished) within 2 days after ordering. Even though it was listed as refurbished it was practically brand new. Many people complain about the design on the laptop, but i have to disagree. Its solidly built and the plastic does not feel cheap. It's super quick and is great for connecting an external monitor through HDMI port. THE ONLY complaint i have so far is the screen. The viewing angles are horrendous and the colors are pale and dull. Overall i do recommend this computer because of the value you get.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "We were looking for a Chromebook for a 13-year old who was already using Google Chrome and Docs for school projects and papers. We chose the Acer C7 series over Samsung and HP because of its price and eventually the C720 because of its battery life (8-10hrs). Honestly, I also did not want to support Samsung anymore. I was though concerned that the laptop would be flimsy like previous netbooks and that $200 was too good to be true.\n\nThe C720 arrived a day before Christmas Eve (whew!) and ended up being the perfect present. The overall exterior build of the machine is good. The screen is a light and flimsy but it's not that bad. The rest of the machine is pretty solid and its operation, brightness, sounds, etc. have been excellent. We were also concerned about the 16GB SSD; this has not been a problem for us so far since he is primarily using this for Google Docs, Play, etc..  Plus, we were excited to have 100GB of Google Cloud Drive storage.\n\nAs we researched more about the C720, we found that its performance was reported to be significantly better than Samsung, HP chromebooks because of its use of a Celeron Intel processor (instead of an AMD). This is our first chromebook but we found its use to be extremely brisk on movies, games, internet use. We were also excited because he ended up completing all the lessons on code.org (learn to code initiative). The battery life is close to 10 hours. So in all, this is a great value for a chromebook and a computer."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I've had my chromebook for a couple weeks now and it's just the perfect thing for me. I'm not a gamer and I'm not a customization-obsessed geek, I'm just an average computer user who likes to surf the net, process photos, do a little word processing and spreadsheet action, stream videos, read some books.\n\nIt's true that without wifi access it's kind of a doorstop, but not entirely. You can still work on documents or spreadsheets, respond to emails (although you can't send them until wifi is restored) and play a wide variety of simple offline games when there's no internet. You can plug in a USB and watch a movie, if you planned ahead.\n\nThe thing charges completely in less than 2 hours and my experience has been that it holds a charge anywhere between 5.5 and 11 hours depending on what you are doing. If you are steadily streaming one video after another, it's closer to 5.5 hours; if you're just web surfing and reading articles, it lasts much longer. I LOVE how fast it boots up and shuts down. I love that there is virtually no lag, ever, when I want to stream videos or music, and that pages load super-fast, even with a couple of dozen tabs open.\n\nThe size is perfect for me - the keyboard is ever so slightly smaller than a normal keyboard, but it is close enough that I don't really have to alter my typing at all to use it. I had an Eee before and the keys were too small and it slowed me down, but that is not a problem with the chromebook. The screen is big enough to be pleasant watching movies and to easily view webpages without having to scroll all over, but the chromebook is small and light enough for me to put in my purse to carry with.\n\nI was torn between buying a chromebook or a tablet, but I am so glad I went with the chromebook. When I want to type, I want to REALLY type - and doing anything longer than a Twitter update on a tablet just feels uncomfortably fiddly to me. The chromebook gives me all of the benefits of a tablet but with a bigger screen and keyboard to make all of my tasks more comfortable. And for under $200 total? Get outta here.\n\nEDIT:  I've had it for a few months now and I am still totally in love.  This is the best $200 I have ever spent.  Seriously."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "If you've been averse to Chromebooks before, you're like me.  There was always something that held me back.  Build quality, lack of computing power, bad battery life, etc.  This one caught my eye, with its specs anyway.  The design of the computer is understated, but the color scheme is nice, as well as the build quality for a budget computer.  Expansion slots are rather generous for this price point as well, featuring USB 2.0 and 3.0 ports, an SD card slot, and an HDMI out so I can expand my desktop and watch movies or videos on my TV if I want.  The only downside is that the shiny black bezel around the screen is rather reflective.  I'm not really sure why they went that route when the rest of the materials are pretty on point.\n\nThe performance and battery life are where this computer shines the most though.  With only 2GB of RAM, you might think that it will be sluggish.  You'd be totally wrong.  With the newest Intel Celeron Processor with the Haswell Architecture, this thing not only performs well above its class in speed, it simply outdoes any of the previous Chromebooks that are anywhere near this price range.  Startup is merely seconds.  That processor also helps keep battery life very good.  I've been using this computer going on 3 weeks now and I've noticed days where I used it for 7+ hours and I still had decent battery life remaining.  A lot of this depends on what you're using your computer for; whether you're working on text in WorkFlowy, have 8 windows open in Chrome, or have your screen brightness up pretty high watching videos.  I typically keep mine at around 2/3 brightness, as I don't work in very bright places, nor do I need it to be bright.\n\nThe keyboard is very nice, even though the spacing in the chiclet keys take some getting used to if you're coming from a more traditional PC keyboard.  The Function keys at top are replaced by just keys that do functions.  Makes it simple and way easier to use than some more feature-heavy Windows laptops.  The speakers, which are underneath the laptop, are actually pretty decent considering how small they are.  I prefer to just use headphones anyway, so that's not really a deal breaker for me.  The touchpad is really nice too, considering the price.  Multi-finger gestures work flawlessly and the feel of the pad is very comfortable.  The \"click\" of the pad, if you press down, is pretty noisy, but you really don't need to use it at all.\n\nI've been getting lots of questions from friends and co-workers about this little machine and I can't help but highly recommend it, just as long as you know what you're delving into.  There is a learning curve if you've never used ChromeOS before, which I hadn't, but there are handy how-to's and guides built into the OS to help you on your way.  As ChromeOS gets updates and the community of WebApps expands, these machines are going to the be at the forefront of a new revolution of computing."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "Acer did it again.  I brought a bargain during the holiday rush, only to find out that I can have 6 more GB of SSD space if I wait for a bit for the same price.  But then I probably get more for everybody.\n\nI actually prefer the Chrome OS.  It's zero maintenance.  No more backup for other people.  It should be fairly easy to sync firefox bookmarks and files across all machines.  But you need to setup.  If you are using the Google services, you are already setup before buying the C720.  If you lost the whole thing, the only thing other people can see is your google user name.  Everything is securely encrypted.  You don't even need to leave your username, but you just have to type it everytime you login.  I had been moving my kids to do homework on Drive so they don't need to worry saving, and can do it on whatever computer they can grasp.  I like Drive for the perfect version control.\n\nChrome OS has very limited apps.  It doesn't support wmv, though probably support most of codecs used in avi.  But the FLEX app works because it is pure html.  You can stream any movies from another machine as server.  If the codec is not supported in Chromeos, it will transcode as it streams.  But you need a decent machine to be fast enough.  Chromeos supports L2TP and a more secure startup mode of openvpn, that most canned vpn servers doesn't support that yet.\n\nYou can install and switch to Crouton (Ubuntu Linux) and back with a hot key.  But ... the same Chromeos kernel is used that is incompatible with the Ubuntu and other Linux kernels.  So Crouton can't be the answer to everything unless it can hot swap the kernel too.  Also, to start Crouton you have to get a terminal in Chrome, type the startup command, and leave the tab on.  I tried to save a few dollars by staying with my old vpn provider while having a cup of coffee but the Chromeos openvpn won't work in Crouton.\n\nChrUbuntu in Intel machines is more like a full blown Ubuntu.  It takes well over an hour to install.  Crouton takes somewhat less.  It occupy less than 5GB.  With 2GB left for Chromeos, I have 3GB user space left for Ubuntu.  Openvpn works.  Encryption works.  For codecs you need to install Ubuntu restricted stuff via software centre.  Full HD WMV works.  Trackpad works as in Chromeos plus you can use finger only to drag without the left mouse button - the Ubuntu/Unity way.\n\nIn a way, dual boot ChrUbuntu is more convenient.  When you power on the chrome book, you will see the warning screen in developer mode, ctrl-D will lead you into the Default Chromeos, and ctrl-L will lead you into the Legacy OS Ubuntu.  Even if you need to switch OS, both boot up very fast in the C720.\n\nThere are some caveats if you comes from Windows or Linux.  There are no mouse buttons on the C720 trackpad.  But the whole trackpad is actually a left mouse button.  Instead of the right mouse button, you can use double finger tap, which is superior and you can't miss.  There's no edge scrolling but I prefer two finger scrolling.  There are no more F function keys.  It is not just with different names.  Full screen is usually F11 but on Chromeos it is F4 if you count the position.  There is one USB 3 and one USB 2 socket because (?) USB 2 device won't work on the USB 3.  And you have to have another computer plus printer connected to the internet so you can print from your Chromebook using cloud print, unless your printer is cloud print ready (not even a wifi printer).\n\nThe speed of C720 is impressive.  It takes a lot less time to boot Ubuntu, but I don't know how much \"smaller\" the distribution is.  For movies in a USB 3 drive, you can use the > and < key to fast forward and back at will.  I don't know how to say this but it's like fast forwarding a VCR, but smoothly and much faster if you don't let go of the key.  You can scroll through the movie in a minute but you can pinpoint to the exact sec with ease.  Just two keys.  It's the same in Chromeos by default and in Ubuntu too.  But by default the Ubuntu player skips 1 minute and back something like 30 sec.  It should be capable of 10 sec forward and 5 sec back, while fast forwarding (and backward) the whole movie in a minute."}

And just as quickly as on my $1000 2012 ssd mac mini.\n\nI was afraid that I wouldn't be able to do much, but I continue to be pleasantly surprised. I can hook this up to an HD monitor and stream HD video on it while continuing to work on my little screen.  There is a file system that can open most files in the chrome browser.  My epub files are handled through a Chrome Extension as I imagine many files are that are not natively supported in the OS. The battery is what it claims to be (8-8.5 hours). The device starts up extremely fast, charges fast (2-2.5 hours?), and shuts down fast.  Being connected to the internet is more important on this device than others, but being connected to the internet is not a problem the vast majority of the time for me.  The screen is more than adequate.  Not great viewing angles but the screen can be tilted 145 degrees or so (just an estimate).  Speakers are loud and adequate.  The touchpad is not super sensitive--you had to make sure your two fingers are a little apart most of the time when scrolling.  I like that you can use 3 fingers on the touchpad to scroll through open tabs. Keyboad is more than adequate to type on. Learning the ropes with keyboard shortcuts is worth your time.\n\nAgain, most of it is adequate. I'm impressed by how quick it is and the battery life.  Well worth $200!!!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I switched to the Acer C720 Chromebook (2GB RAM) after spending most of my life on Windows PCs and laptops. At first, the switch was weird, as it would be for anyone in any situation where one uses an unfamiliar device. But once I figured out how to utilize and customize the Chrome OS to my liking, I've become a very happy Chromebook user.\n\nAfter I set everything up to my liking, I started noticing a lot of nay-saying about the Chromebook I've come to love and use as my primary computer. A lot of this negative talk has come from Microsoft and, I suppose, power users. Or people who just don't like Google in general.\n\nBut I digress on the latter because that's such a heated topic and that's not what I want to write in my review about. What I do want to do, though, is dispel this misconception that the Chromebook is a total brick without wi-fi.\n\nHere's what I can do offline:\n\n- Listen to music\n- Read epub and mobi ebooks\n- Read pdf files\n- Write txt, docx, and gdoc files\n- Get to my Google Drive\n- Play games (though I'll be honest, I don't play games on my Chromebook, but I know it is something I could do if I wanted; it's just that any game you want to play has to be on the Chrome store and it needs to be made for both online and offline use)\n- Read email\n- Create mindmaps\n- Create notes on Google Keep\n- Create tasks on Wunderlist\n\nNow, one may still think that's still not a lot, but let's keep this in perspective: this is how I utilize my Chromebook every day, excluding whatever browsing I might do on the Internet. And these are the only tasks that I want to have if I'm offline. When I'm online, I do a lot of other stuff, granted--but for those days I might not have wi-fi, I can rest assured knowing I can at least do what I need to do on my Chromebook without any issues or panic.\n\nSo clearly, the Chromebook isn't a brick offline. All the essentials are there. And honestly, I find it much nicer because there's less distraction. I can focus on my tasks throughout the day instead of fiddling with my desktop and groaning about using a laptop that I feel like I will never utilize completely. In that way, Chromebook shines. It's not for everyone, but it is for someone like me.\n\nEDIT: I also want to add that I watch videos online, on YouTube and other websites, and it works wonderfully. I have no complaints. In fact, I've found that videos load more quickly on this Chromebook than it did on the HP laptop I used to have. On the HP laptop, if I was watching a movie online, it'd take an hour or two to load completely. On the Chrome OS, the same video might take, what--5 or so minutes to load. Ever so often, it might take longer, but it's happened rarely."}

Screen and track pad work well for me.  I've used many operating systems & interfaces and I think this is my new favorite.  It is familiar, but improved in many thoughtful ways.  At first I was concerned about several things including the search key instead of caps lock -- I was thinking I would just revert it back but I found I love the search key as the default.  Easily launch any of your apps or start a web search with a single key.  Then beginning to type what you are looking for or you can select from a visual selection if you prefer.  Function keys display their actual use instead of F##.  Built in comprehensive help including alternate key functions. I wondered if I would be able to do all I need to in the ChromeOS?  So far the answer is yes, and do it very well.  I now prefer to use it over my desktop computer, even though I bought it for travel and light evening use.  To collaborate with others in my small business, I had already switched to Xero accounting and Google Docs for most of my business collaboration.  I love that I can access and update anywhere, not worry about saving or backing up.  Now even spreadsheets can be created, accessed and updated when offline and syncing is automatic next time you are connected.  More on the laptop: lightning fast, solid, very light and portable, amazing battery life, plays online videos seamlessly, runs all my apps and online software without hesitation, turns on from sleep instantly, powers on from fully off (rare) very quick.  I have not yet found a downside to this laptop or ChromeOS, even though I was a little skeptical.  Thank you Acer for this award winning laptop and Google for this slick, revolutionary operating system.  I would recommend this laptop to my parents, business users who have flexibility to use new, more flexible tools, students (big yes) and anyone who is tired of worrying about viruses, applying updates or fussing with your computer.  You may not be happy with this laptop if you are looking for a large screen (this one is made to be very portable), want to play the latest games (not for the serious gamer) or are tied to legacy programs like old fashion accounting or old fashion productivity tools that are installed only locally and not cloud based (everything here is designed to be shared online through your Google account or other credentials so you can access it from anywhere and any computer, though much of it can be also done offline, then synced next time you get online).  Happy Laptop Hunting."}

In effect, its performance and speed have degenerated, despite keeping it as healthy as possible. Seeing as how I do most of my computer work online nowadays anyway, getting a Chromebook was the most cost effective alternative to getting another laptop or desktop.\n\nEverything you need to use the internet as effective as possible is in the Chromebook through the usage of applications. Some standard apps that come with the unit are Google Chrome, Docs, Play, Drive, GMail, and pretty much everything else in the app store.\n\nTwo gigs of SDRAM, and 16 gigs of solid state hard drive space, and 100 gigs of space on the Google Drive is pretty good for a computer of this scope. Unit boots up in seconds...literally! Computer has built in virus protection, and it updates itself, so no worries on that end.\n\nPlease take note however, that this is not a Windows based laptop...it's literally just the Google Chrome web browser in laptop form, loaded with all kinds of applications. So if you need something that'll do more work than just browse the web, play music, and edit documents, I highly recommend getting an actual laptop.\n\nIf you find yourself online most of the time, doing nothing much beyond that, you can't go wrong with the Chromebook."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I purchased this Chromebook for my mom to replace her aging ThinkPad Windows notebook computer.\n\nSome background: A few years ago my dad who is in his 80's switched from a Windows laptop to the iPad and has absolutely loved it. Previously I was always having to make house calls to fix his Windows laptop since there were so many random ways that he could change the settings, drag and drop things to the wrong place, have issues with the internet, etc. The switch to the iPad gave him a very consistent environment that doesn't provide an easy way to accidentally change settings or do anything that will prevent him from getting on the internet, checking his e-mail, etc. To top it all off he really likes the interface as he was never really a keyboard and mouse person anyways.\n\nFast forward to today... My mom, who's in her 70's, was always having similar issues with her laptop. Problems connecting to the internet, issues with losing icons on the desktop, figuring out bookmarks, accessing her mail, etc. The catalyst was when she complained that the computer no longer was lasting very long without being plugged into power. She doesn't like the iPad design since she prefers and keyboard and also likes to sit the computer on a table with the screen visible without having to hold it. I already had her setup with a Google account since she uses Gmail so the Chromebook was a natural choice for me to consider for her.\n\nWhen the Chromebook arrived I set it up with her Google account and then gave it to her accompanied by a brief lesson on how to use it. Needless to say this thing is levels and levels beyond her old Windows computer. It boots AMAZINGLY fast. From a full power-off state it boots up and is ready to use in about 6 seconds!\n\nThe integration with Google is of course very tight. Once she is logged into the computer she is also logged into Google so her e-mail is just available right away rather than her having to go to the Gmail website and enter her username and password again.\n\nThe hardware design is also great. This thing is very lightweight and slim. It is like a luxury item compared to her old computer even though the Chromebook cost just a fraction of her old one!\n\nSo far she has been using it without any problems. I can judge how good a product is for the average user based on how many \"tech support\" calls I get from my parents. In the case of the Chromebook the support calls have dropped significantly!\n\nIf you are looking for the ideal computer for an older relative or for somebody who just isn't into all the technical aspects of traditional computers then this is a great low-cost solution. The overall design and form is perfect for being mobile and the operating system itself is very streamlined and simple, yet powerful enough to get all the usual internet needs (browsing the web, e-mail, etc.) taken care of."}

Many people that have given this a poor rating is because they believe it needs internet access to do anything. They obviously bought this type of computer for the wrong reason, and not enough knowledge. If you want to use it as an only online computer in chrome os, go ahead... But that is only using half of the potential, if not less, that this machine has to offer.\n\nPersonally I use this computer for programming, and as a media device to randomly plug into tv's and such. I also use this any time I am not at home, seeing as it is so portable and has an easy 10 hours of battery life, its great.\n\nAnother reason people dislike this product is because it can't play games. Well it can... Personally I don't game on this computer, I have another computer dedicated to that, and I use the chromebook to be productive, but if I really wanted to, I could install steam on any decent version of linux (debian, arch, fedora, centos, ubuntu, etc.) and play games. I have seen people play Skyrim on this chromebook (albeit on the lowest graphics settings).\n\nOverall, it is a great computer, but you should really try and unleash the full potential of it yourself, or else you won't be having the best time you could with your new chromebook.\n\nEDIT: An easy way to make your chromebook run chrome os and another version of linux is to google search \"crouton\" and go to the \"dnschneid/crouton  GitHub\" entry, and follow the instructions. It basically installs the chosen distro of linux inside chrome os, and you run it inside chrome os, allowing you to seamlessly switch between both os's at any time with a simple key combo. Personally I use Debian Jessie with LXDE, if you don't know what I just said, just follow the instructions, which will give you Ubuntu with XFCE.\n\nAlso, to do this you need to have your chromebook in developer mode. You can do this by:\n\n  -Press and hold the Esc+F3 (Refresh) keys, then press the Power button. This enters recovery mode.\n  -Now, press Ctrl+D (no prompt). It will ask you to confirm, then the system will revert its state and enable developer mode.\n  -Press Ctrl+D (or wait 30 seconds for the beep and boot) at the white boot splash screen to enter Chrome OS.\n  (copied from arch wiki)\n\nGOING INTO DEV MODE FOR THE FIRST TIME WILL ERASE ANYTHING YOU HAD ON YOUR CHROMEBOOK, SO BACK IT UP!"}

I have a great iMac desktop that I use when I want to work on apps like photoshop, lightroom and premiere pro. So it became obvious to me that i had a $1200 web browser (always running chrome) that really was not being used to it's full potential. So when my son decided that he wanted a laptop, I decided to look at the new chromebooks for him. But after doing a little research and soul searching, I decided it made more sense to buy myself the Chromebook and give my son the macbook.\n\nSo far it has been a great decision. The small size of the chromebook make it extremely portable. Much like a tablet, I find that I can take this thing anyplace that I would take my 10 inch tablet. Closed, this chromebook is almost the same size as my tablet in it's leather case. And, for whatever reason, I prefer to use something with a dedicated keyboard over a touch screen.\n\nThe battery life in this thing is much better than the battery life of the macbook. It almost seems to match the battery life of my Samsung Galaxy 10.1 Tablet and may even beat it. Never really tested them both.\n\nNow initially it was a bit difficult for me to figure out how to deal with files on the chromebook but once I did, doing things like downloading photos, saving them, posting them to facebook and sending them in emails became simple.\n\nIn reviews I read that this 2GB version would slow down when multiple windows were open. I have not had that experience. I am a man who always has about ten windows open at any given time. This chromebook  handles as many windows as I normally would have open without much noticeable change in speed. No real difference from my macbook there.\n\nThere have been so many reviews of this thing, I really shouldn't waste time typing so much. If you like browsing the net using Chrome and need a laptop to perform the basic tasks, then this is the device for you."}

I am already heavily entrenched into the Google ecosystem and consequently the Chromebook was a big draw.  For those not quite entrenched in Google, I can understand why a Chromebook may not be as appealing.\n\nLet me be clear:  I already have a work windows based laptop that I can do various things if necessary.  What I mainly needed was something to more easily type long emails, etc on.  We mainly use it for the internet and doing more robust web browsing when the android tablet just won't quite cut it.  The Chromebook fits the bill to the \"T\"!\n\nOne review I saw about windows based laptops vs Chromebooks that i agree with: Chromebooks do not need as robust hardware because they don't have the heavy and complicated windows software that needs a fast processor to operate.  2 gig RAM is more than enough.  And the Haswell based processor is plenty zippy and keeps the laptop running for days for me with periodic use.\n\nThe selling point for me?  Once I realized I can access my old laptop with my Chromebook using Google's \"Chrome Remote Desktop\", I was in business.  This way I can access my windows laptop and my keystrokes on my Chromebook control my old windows based laptop and my old laptop sends the screen to my Chromebook's monitor.

I thought I gave that all to my grandson however he does not have it.\n\nI really am very disappointment as I heard how wonderful this item is.  In my grandsons eyes, it is not.  I am disappointed as this grandson is a very \"quite\"  and he was just so excited about the chrome book and within an hour of recieving it discovered it did not meet his expectations.  Another aggrivating issue is I asked around and called stores that usually carry the chrome book and they just went on and on.  I specifically asked about games and was told \"no problem, plays them all\"  Well it doesn't.  Not quite sure what I need to do next, all I know is I have a very disappointment boy in my family.\nThanks You for listening"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "Last Christmas, I got the kids a Kindle Fire.  This year, I got them this Chromebook.  It's a great alternative to a tablet as it has a keyboard to enable typing and document creation.  No set-up is necessary, I just turned it on and boom I am on the web in seconds!  The launcher at the bottom is a nice feature to add your favorite apps for a quick launch.  It's just one click to launch the webcam.  I really like cloud computing as it allows me the flexibility of creating a document at work and then accessing and revising it home  without needing to send it via email and worry about multiple copies and versions.\n\nThe only drawback to this Chromebook are printing and projecting the Chromebook onto my TV.  Unless you have a Cloud Print compatible printer, you would need to connect your classic printer to cloud print using your PC/laptop (Google these terms for setup instructions).  Once these are set up, using your Chromebook, you can virtually queue your documents to this cloud print queue.  If your PC/laptop is on and connected to your printer, it will print out your documents.  Since I have a laptop that is not permanently connected to my printer, I would need to fire up my laptop and connect it to the printer to print these documents.  So,  there is little advantage of using the Chromebook.  I may as well just use my laptop and print from it!\n\nAdditionally, projecting the Chromebook to my TV using a HDMI cable is not intuitive.  Even after many tries, the projected screen on the TV is not fully extended to fit the size of my TV.  I am buying Chromecast to see whether the projection would be easier.\n\nIt's overall a good machine especially if you mainly use it for quick web browsing (it boots up much faster than a PC/laptop) or document creation.  It would be great if I can just plug the Chromebook to my printer and directly print!"}

Boy was that a good decision. I have a desktop with a beast of a cpu, a fast gpu, and a massive monitor, I really don't need that windows/mac laptop. If you're a student that's not in the field of math and engineering, this is a good machine to have. There are even web-based IDE for programming. Still waiting on the Arduino IDE, though.\n\nEven without a linux install (which is super easy with this gen of chromebook) this is a very productive device. System is very responsive. The boot up time isn't 7 seconds - more like 4 seconds. All settings are saved, so there's no worry of having your chromebook wiped. It's also super easy to share your laptop with other, just have them logging using their google account.\n\nAll in all, I wouldn't get this chromebook if you don't have another powerful machine.

Is it powerful and able to do half of what my MBP could? No, of course not. But that's not the point of this machine. For light work (browsing the internet, checking mail, very simple word processing, etc), this does the trick. I got the 2GB model and have had no problems. I sometimes find myself using Google Remote Desktop to access my powerful desktop from the comfort of my couch, and it works with almost no lag.\n\nSome thoughts in comparison to the Samsung Series 3:\n\n-I was surprised by how heavy this thing felt. It's not much heavier, but you can really feel it. It was a little disappointing when I first picked it up. Still, it's not exactly a sack of bricks. It's really light, just not as light.\n\n-It feels sturdier. The keys on the Samsung constantly fall off, but these feel like they're holding on well (so far). I'll certainly update if I have problems.\n\n-The keys are a little hard to press in the beginning. It takes a few days of getting used to, but they are definitely harder to press than my macbook pro and just about any other modern keyboard I've used. That's not necessarily a bad thing, just a matter of taste.\n\n-The screen is beautiful on both machines.\n\nAll in all, I'm happy I got this machine over the Series 3, mainly because of the issue with the keys falling off of the latter. I would prefer that machine in just about every way if not for the keys. This is great though, and I can't think of a reason to dock any stars at this moment."}

I use the Chromebook for web surfing, and since I don't play games I don't miss all the apps; there's a website for everything I need.  I have the 2GB RAM version, and I haven't had any noticeable degradation in performance.  I frequently have 5-10 tabs open at a time.  As for the touch pad, it took a getting use to, but after several weeks I really liked it.  The only problem is trying to select large blocks of text can be tricky.  The screen isn't as good as most laptops, but for a couple hundred dollars it isn't bad.  One thing that's really nice is there's no function keys, and they're replaced by very useful buttons like contrast, volume, refresh etc..  Overall I'm extremely happy with this Chromebook."}

Knowing she likes using Google Chrome, Gmail and other Google products, I decided to focus on a Google oriented computer. Chromebook and I'm glad I did. She loves it.\n\nThe Chromebook is perfect in size,  you feel like you're using a laptop without the chunkiness. The bootup is extremely fast, turn it on and you're ready to go in seconds. The graphics and sound quality are fine for watching movies or listening to music.\n\nOne feature she liked, you can set the touch pad to scroll with two fingers, making for easy web browsing. For applications, Google has numerous additional applications that can be used on the Chromebook.\n\nThere is a decent amount of space to store personal files on the Chromebook, it is also compatible with external USB drives and SD cards if you need more space. You do not have to use Google Drive, my fiancee uses a 64GB SDXC card for extra storage.\n\nAs for durability, durability is fine for everyday normal use. If you have a habit of dropping computers, don't blame the product if you break it, instead buy a laptop designed for handling abuse.\n\nA lot of the complaints about this Chromebook are clearly from people who did not bother to take the time to read the product description.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I've been reading about Chromebooks all year; the concept was pretty intriguing, despite the fact that I have a bunch of other/similar devices:  an entry-level Sony Vaio from 2011, an X51 Alienware desktop PC for gaming, a 2011 Kindle Fire, and a Moto X smartphone.  So why add a Chromebook?\n\nI wanted a multi-use device that could...\n\nStream music from my Amazon Cloud\nStream instant video from Amazon (great selection of kids stuff) and Netflix\nRun full versions of websites\nHave a full keyboard, for writing emails or various other things\n\nThe Chromebook does all this stuff for basically the same price as a tablet, but it is much closer to a full function PC than a tablet is.  I like it as a video device far more than a tablet.  I like it for using the web far more than a tablet or smartphone.  For items not related to gaming, it has basically replaced my laptop in its entirety.\n\nAbout Chrome OS and this device:  I'm currently streaming music from Amazon with 9 Chrome tabs open and have no issues at all.  I have a hard time understanding what people need 4GB RAM for with this device; how is it useful to open 15+ Chrome tabs?  I haven't run into any performance issues at all.  The boot time is absurd.  7 seconds may be underestimating.  It also shuts off instantly when you hit shutdown.\n\nThus far I've had no real issues with the Chrome store or apps; Google Docs is fine so far for working with MS Word items, and in fact Google Drive is now installed on all my devices because I've started doing my writing on this device.  Remote Desktop lets you connect to any of your Windows PCs for using Windows programs through those computers if you really need to, though I imagine I'd have to be using this more for work to need that for anything.\n\nI've used this to watch a decent amount of content on Netflix and Amazon Instant.  The screen is... ok.  It isn't all that bright and won't \"wow\" you but as a portable mini-TV it does the job.  My son loves watching his kids shows on this, which lets us reclaim the real TV for our purposes.  Speaker quality is likewise functional but won't blow you away.  Headphones are the way to go when possible.  As it relates to both of these, I'm perfectly happy with the quality for the price.\n\nI didn't have any issues with the keyboard, I'm normally a 90 WPM typer and am probably a bit slower on this, more due to the size than anything.  I actually like the trackpad to be honest.  Not sure why folks don't.  It isn't the worlds greatest but is way better than the one on my Dell PC from work and perhaps marginally worse than the one on my Vaio.  My basic Logitech wireless mouse worked fine with the Chromebook, but I stopped using it pretty quickly as I got used to the trackpad.  The dual-finger scrolling and chrome forward/backward helps a lot.\n\nBattery life is pretty nuts.  I've gotten about 7 hours of pure video streaming.  At the high end, just off the charger, you get some arbitrarily high readings (like 9+ hours) but I think the claimed 8 hours is probably accurate.\n\nThe fact that you can \"hack\" this thing into installing Ubuntu is awesome.  I haven't done it yet, but the concept is very cool.  Native gaming in Chrome OS is miserable outside a few highlights; I'd say the main one is the Chrome version of Bastion, which suggests companies COULD make some great games if they wanted to.  But with Ubuntu, you can theoretically play Linux-compatible games you may have; I know I have a bunch from Humble Bundle (such as FTL) that should run great on this laptop, even if it wasn't meant to do so.  I bet it can run older games very well also, such as Half Life 2 or the original Portal.  My next project is to play around and see if I can pull off Steam and if the 16GB SSD can handle something like that.  If so, I'd give this thing... six stars?  Can't really give it more than I already am.\n\nAnyway... know what you're getting into here.  This isn't a full Windows laptop.  You can install Linux and access a lot of full-featured laptop programs that way, but even still, your hard drive space is limited and this may be beyond the basic users capabilities.  If you do video compiling, music or photo editing, gaming, etc. as your main laptop activities, this would need to be a 2nd computer for you.  If you find yourself using alternate devices like a smartphone or tablet in your house for watching movies, listening to music, or browsing the web, you might get great mileage out of this device. I know I have.\n\nHighly, highly recommended device.  I love this thing.\n\nEDIT: Just over 90 days of use later, and I can tell you that I've completely fallen in love with this device. It is the fastest Chrome device in my house, far faster than the dual-core Sony Vaio it replaced and even faster than my core i7 Haswell gaming desktop. I've installed Ubuntu 13.04 and 13.10, both XFCE and Unity, through both USB 3.0 and SD card, and played Minecraft and Steam games on this thing. The batter life is still epic. What else is there to say?  This is, hands down, the single best value buy in all of computing right now.\n\nIf you want to read more about Chromebooks and you're not sure if they're right for you, check this out:  [...]"}

The operating system stays current with no need of 3rd party virus protection.  (No more wasting precious time in an internet cafe while Windows slowly updates its latest patches!)  I read earlier negative comments about the keyboard and the touch pad but I've experienced no problems with either on my C720.  Perhaps this has been addressed already (my model was purchased in December 2013 and was assembled in November 2013).  I'm using it a lot more than I had expected."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I picked this out for my mom and she loves it! It's very lightweight and small so it's perfect for traveling, but good for regular use as well because the screen isn't tiny. It's got a very minimal desktop setup, and very easy to understand settings and controls for even the most inexperienced users. Word of advice: don't get this if you're looking for anything other than a very minimal computer- it doesn't really even have any basic programs on it and is pretty much useless without the internet, although it does come with a decent webcam. My mom only really ever uses her computer for the internet which is pretty much what this was made for. The only real con I found is that some accessories for it (like hard cases) are hard to come by because it's a new model I guess. It's a good gift for anyone who just wants to go online."}

In the end it came down to one of these or a macbook air - but since this computer did everything that we needed to do we decided to try to save ourselves the extra $$ and give chromebooks a try.\n\nMy wife couldn't be happier with the chromebook - it's nice and snappy on the web, easy and intuitive to use, long battery life, and nice and light.  She has a 13in macbook pro that she doesn't even use anymore for home use because she prefers the size and feel of the chromebook.\n\nThe biggest limitation that I see with the chromebook is a lack of software available for the platform - but if your computer use is web-based it really doesn't matter.\n\nA great product, would purchase again."}

I hate this bickering that has the consumers as hostages.\n\nThere is a problem also with Chrome Browser, that refuses to imagine a scenario where the user, being somewhere abroad, wants to be informed by an american site, in english. The browser offers stubbornly the same sight translated instead of the original.  They are oversmarting , in my view.\n\nHaving said that, there are some goodies in the chromebook, it is fast, light, its battery is good,the quality of sound is good for its size, and the price is very adequate.\n\nregards"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "The perfect traveling business computer (and family computer). I've gotten tired over the years of getting my family (wife and 3 kids all ages) a new computer every few years because by playing online games, etc. it's gotten so bloated or infected with malware that it's unrecoverable. No more waiting 8 minutes for the computer to boot up (this one is more like 4 seconds) or 2 minutes for it to shut down (instant), or \"Dad, why is this thing running so slow?\". Everyone can hop on and off as they need, quickly or not. The keyboard is a necessity for writing papers and emails (thus why I did not opt for a tablet). Integration with Google accounts is seamless. I can use it for business (at least most of it) and when it's not in use for that, anyone can log on and I have no worries about cross contamination or it getting bogged down. It's lightning fast - not the prettiest chromebook available, but I have no complaints about how it looks. The extra horsepower and battery life far outweigh any vanity issues I have.\n\nWhere computers, traditional laptops, and tablets fail, the chromebook shines. And at this price point, if it gets broken it's not the end of the world."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I purchased this unit and replaced the internal 16GB M.2 SSD with a 128GB model.  This laptop works quite nicely for those of us who like to get our hands dirty.  It comes with Google Chrome but there are google-able instructions on how to adjust it to boot a non-chrome OS.  Ubuntu linux should work pretty much out of the box.\n\nI purchased the unit to get BSD running on it.  I'm hacking DragonFlyBSD into shape and solved the boot loader and keyboard issues and am working on the mouse pad.  X runs fine in VESA mode (so great for 2D), sans the mouse pad which I am still working on.  FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, and so forth will not current boot due to numerous fixable issues but I assume that since I got them fixed in DragonFly, that the other BSD's will be able to get them fixed too.\n\nFor developers I suggest loading a couple of 16G usb sticks.  Load one with the Chrome recovery image (google-able to get it), one with your favorite OS, and consider purchasing an internal M.2 form-factor SSD to upgrade the 16G internals.  The case is *trivial* to take apart... just a lot of screws and simple snap-tight after that (be sure to break the warranty seal can unscrew the screw under it).  With the recovery image in-hand you can feel free to blow away the internal SSD... if you mess up and get stuck you can always reload it from the recovery image.\n\nThe only downside when running non-chrome OSs is that the laptop boots up with a BIOS warning screen that you have to hit ctrl-L to get past.  There's no way to get rid of it short of mod'ing the HW which I do not suggest.  However, I am not going to dock it a star for that one issue.  Also note that there are only 2 USB ports and *no* hard ethernet... you have to use the built-in wireless adapter (it's an Atheros AR9460).\n\nThis laptop has a pretty nice display for its small size.  With DragonFly it pulls 7.1 watts idle with the lid closed and ~8W with it open (and DragonFly isn't power-savings-optimized).  That's with the wifi turned on... so not bad at all.  The laptop has a Celeron(R) 2955U @ 1.40GHz (haswell) class cpu in it... considerably faster than the atom-based netbooks of old!  For comparison, this cpu is about 5x slower on a per-core basis than a 3.4GHz desktop I7, and has 2 cores (so about 15x slower than a 4-core/8-thread 3.4GHz I7).  Which is not bad at all considering that the whole laptop only pulls 8 watts from the wall.\n\nThe unit has 2G of ram.  The OS is able to use ~1.7GB of it.  Keep in mind that with a bigger SSD inside you can set up a SSD swap partition on it, and at 300MB/sec+ and no random seek overhead, the 2G of ram is not a big deal.\n\n-Matt"}

After giving her the C-710 I decided to get a Chomebook for myself. I went with the C-720 because of the great reviews that I read on multiple web sites and the price. This computer is very fast and very efficient. There will be information out there stating that a Chromebook is useless without the internet and this is false. There are offline apps that can be downloaded and used. You can create documents and play offline games. You can even access emails that you have previously read with gmail offline.\nPlease do your research before you buy this if you are an avid Microsoft user because there are differences. However, most files are transferable and google has similar programs. For instance, Google Docs is basically Microsoft Word, and Google Sheets is the same as Excell. I recommend keeping a Microsoft based computer in the house if you are an avid Itunes user or just like Microsoft in general, but this is a great on-the-go little laptop that is very versitile."}

I can honestly say this is the best chromebook so far. The build quality is what I would expect for $199, but it is solid and light.  Many reviewers complain about the screen, but it is fine (on par with the Samsung series 3). It is a matte finish and you have to appreciate the anti-glare viewing you will get outside.\n\nThe major selling points for me regarding this chromebook are the battery and the processing power. I have many computers, but nothing browses the web and renders web pages faster than this chromebook.  It does boot in 7 seconds or less and you can have many tabs open and still browse with great speed. The keyboard and mouse are sufficient too.  I would put them in the \"average\" category and they get the job done.  There are no issues and it is easy enough to type that I am writing this review on the chromebook.\n\nThe battery life is also exceptional.  I easily get 7 hours on a charge and rarely have to carry the (also light and small) charger.  That is a plus for me as a student and a teacher.\n\nThe C720 won't win any beauty contests (unlike the HP 11 Chromebook) but the beauty is on the inside.  If you want a chromebook, this is the best of the bunch in this price range.  I will not be getting rid of this chromebook anytime soon. This is what a chromebook should be!"}

I love typing, and I am not interested in touch screens, so this is perfect.  The 7 seconds to boot up is a real treat.  I took the Chromebook along when I spent the day at a Hospital with friend getting lengthy treatments.  The hospital has public wi-fi which we attached to without a hitch.  We had a lot of fun with the Chromebook while there at the hospital.  I have been using it regulariy at home and find it very useful and fun. I connected to my Netflix account with no problem and seem to have flawless streaming.  And it really does have 8 plus hours of battery life.\n\nI am giving 4 stars, instead of 5, for two reasons.  First, when I ordered the 2 gb of RAM Chromebook, I thought I would be able to install 2 more gigs of RAM someday, myself.  Turns out that is not possible.  It is no one's fault but my own that I did not do enough research, still, it is disappointing (upgrading is fun).  All that being said, it turns out 2 gigs of RAM seems totally ample. I can have had multiple screens open with no problem.\n\nThe second negative is that the chromebook does not connect to my home network.  Yes, it connects to my wi-fi, but otherwise it does not engage with any other devices via my router.  Not even the printer.  ( in the long run, there is a way to use your home printer, via \"the cloud\", which I have done).  It might not be fair for me to fault the Chromebook in this regard.  It simply is not a Microsoft Windows computer, and it does not behave as one.  Its a new way of computing, and it takes a while to get the feel for it."}

I don't know about other Chomebooks but this one is perfect for me and the family, we love it.\nIt is very portable, its light weight and long battery life make it a go any where computer. It starts up and shuts down in seconds, with my desktop if I wanted to use the internet I would weigh the importance of what I wanted to check against turning on the desktop and waiting for it to load all its programs so I can finally use the web browser. So in the past I would use my phone but then have to deal with mobile page versions or the regular webpage but the inconvenience of small print and some pages just don't work on the phone. The Chromebook solved all those issues, On average I turn this thing on 5-6 times a day.\nMy wife the same, she loves the ease of use and the fact that she can create documents for work on Google Docs. and they are compatible with Microsoft Office, Word, Powerpoint and the other tools in Office. She uses social media websites with no problems as well.\nMy daughter uses it for Youtube and for an online game Animal jam. it performs flawless for both. I also play on WGT.com on it with no issues.\nSome people complain about the screen resolution, I have no issues here. I watch Netflix and other videos on here.\n\nIf you are looking for something to browse the internet, watch videos and create and edit documents with a laptop. This is the computer for you. It seems now that companies are taking Chromebooks serious now and more companies will start producing these fantastic machines. I am excited for the future of these."}

Then, a friend mentioned getting an Acer Chromebook and how much she loved it. I told my husband to change my Christmas request, if possible. Santa delivered and I couldn't be happier.\n\n I have used my Chromebook to Facebook, play Candy Crush, email, pay bills, watch Netflix, upload a sale to Craigslist, ebay, shop online, watch youtube videos, and surf the net.\n\n My six year old has used my new Chromebook a few times with no issues. She can find \"her\" websites (American Girl, PBS Kids, Nick Jr, Disney) without a single problem. My daughter has never used a laptop. She immediately taught herself to use the track pad.\n\n The battery life of the Chromebook is awesome and it charges faster than any device that I have. The track pad is simple to use. Two finger touch/press and your have your \"right click\" function to save, cut, copy, paste, spell check and more.\n\n I have no problem with the Chrome OS.

The screen is looks great and the battery life is great.\n\nI have the 2GB version but wanted the at-the-time unavailable 4GB.  I have found the 2GB to be enough memory, per crosh & top. Video and embedded Adobe products use a lot of memory, so keeping those tabs closed when not in use helps.  Chrome OS will discard memory for \"low priority\" tabs when memory runs out; meaning you would need to reload those pages when you click on a discarded tab.  So, you really always have memory.\n\nRendering is slower than any other real laptop or desktop I own. So have your expectations set properly for performance.

The concept intrigued me since they were originally released, but I wasn't sure that a Chromebook would be enough to fit my needs.  After a lot of research that included reading many reviews, I finally jumped in and got one.  I could not be more pleased! This particular model is a great value, and for web browsing and email reading, it is perfect. The battery life is really good (over 6 hours depending on usage), and it is really light!\n\nThis is not a regular Windows computer, so you should be sure that you understand that before buying it so that you aren't disappointed. But for general Internet, email, Youtube, Facebook, etc, this is a great device. And with the Google offline apps, it can be used for word processing, taking notes, and other functions.\n\nMy only complaint is that the keyboard has those flat keys that look like chicklets, which makes it more difficult to type because you can barely feel where one key ends and the next begins. Plus, the keys don't feel very durable. However, most of the use I plan on giving it involves web browsing with limited typing, so it shouldn't be a problem. But if you are a blogger or plan on typing a book on this, make sure you try the keyboard at a store before you buy..."}

Many people may not be able to hear it, but if you have sensitive ears (i.e., you've experienced going into someone else's home or office and you need to leave because either a TV, computer or lamp is making a sound that's driving you insane and nobody else can hear it), you might want to steer clear. I Googled, and according to a couple of threads on Reddit,  I'm not the only one who has this problem with the C720.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I will not say a Chromebook will replace what a PC or Mac can do. But for a lot of consumers it will probably be enough. The Hazwell chip is so much better then what the Samsung Chromebook has that you should not even consider the Samsung. I have now had both a Samsung and the Acer C720 and the Acer is improved so much over the Samsung. I like the feel of the Acer keyboard and the Touchpad is a decent size because it does not have a lot of multi touch features. Chromebook's really remind me of a Netbook with a OS built for a small form and minimal hardware specs. When you match hardware with a minimalist operating system like Chrome OS you get good battery life, responsive user interface and a good user experience. Its way better then buying a cheap Windows 8 machine which is a terrible match with cheap hardware and a more bloated OS. I first considered a small MacBook Air the 11.6\" model but for $999 its really a expensive piece of hardware for what I intended to use it for. So finding the Acer with a much improved Hazwell CPU which provides good 8hr plus battery is better choice for me. The only down side to a Chromebook is that you are stuck in a Google ecosystem and more specific a Chrome OS ecosystem. So if you are using apps like iTunes, Microsoft Office, some tax software, or like other browsers like Firefox, Opera or IE. Your gonna find a Chromebook restrictive. No it does not run Skype either. I am perfectly fine with this, but I do think this limits a Chromebook's appeal and usefulness by not being able to run some apps that work on almost every other platform. I am sure a lot of people will buy a Chromebook or get one for a gift and be either impressed or disappointed in it. I can embrace it because its basically a web access device for me. But I am sure others will find it constrictive."}

Has an SD reader so if you think you need more space than the SSD provides, you can always pop a card in for more storage.\n\nPros: Surprisingly quick, light/portable, EXTREMELY long battery life (around 8 or 9 hours), very inexpensive, always stays automatically updated, and Google stays on the ball with updates.\n\nCons: Lower quality screen in comparison with higher-end laptops (can be understood with price).\n\nI see that some people list the fact that this computer is only fully functional when connected to the internet as a \"con.\"  However, this is a Chromebook, they are made for internet-based use, so I did not feel that was a fair assessment.\n\nBottom Line: My other computer is a Core i5 Ultrabook and the Acer C720 is an impressive machine to me.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I got my first Chromebook about six months ago, it was Samsung series 3 with an ARM processor. Initially it meant to serve me as a second laptop for occasional light work online, but very soon I realized that I was using it most of the time. My powerful Windows laptop and Mac mini were just sitting there collecting dust, getting my attention only once a week at best. I replaced my Samsung with Acer C720 2 GB RAM version two weeks ago.\nHere's a quick breakdown.\n- C720 has a slightly better screen than Samsung. Same washed out colors, but contrast and viewing angles are better, and so is brightness level. If you are spoiled by the screens of modern tablets, you might think that 1366x768 resolution would look unattractive. That's not quite right. I should remind you that MacBook Air 11 screen has the same resolution and the same size. It's just enough to do what it's designed to do.\n- The keyboard layout of C720 may not be as good as Samsung's, but I like Acer's feel and key movement better. Unless you have very large hands, it might provide one of the best typing experiences in the price range below $300, and it's definitely better than most Windows laptops for that price. I write quite a lot and C720's keyboard didn't cause any significant discomfort so far. Touchpad is reasonably good, but nothing to be overexcited about. I only wish it was a bit larger.\n- C720 is WAY faster than Samsung. Don't be deceived by the name of the processor - this Celeron unit from the Haswell family has more processing power than Chrome OS requires. And 2 GB of RAM should be absolutely enough for anyone, who normally doesn't keep over a dozen tabs running heavy websites simultaneously. The fan would kick in from time to time, but it's very quiet and is never annoying. Boot time is typically impressive for Chrome OS devices and takes around 7 seconds.\n- Battery life is one of the sweetest spots of this laptop. To get promised 8.5 hours you don't have to keep the screen brightness at 50% all the time (as you would do with the Samsung to get 6.5 hours). I don't carry the charger with me and never managed to make it run out of juice. In fact, sometimes I would even give some boost to my phone's battery from C720 without worrying that it may die unexpectedly. Also, the battery charges pretty quickly.\n- Speakers of C720 are louder than Samsung's, but they don't sound much better - they shoot down at the table (or your lap) and don't really promise anything. But plug in headphones or external speakers and you'll get some decent sound quality for a low budget device.\n- The Web Camera on C720 is also superior to the one in Samsung. Promised difference in resolution might not be that visible, but it keeps higher framerate, works better in low light and seems like it captures a wider viewing angle. It is definitely an upgrade. Microphone gets the job done, but it's not very useful in somewhat noisy environment.\n- C720 is a little bit heavier than Samsung, but by no means it is heavy or bulky. It is still a portable laptop that could be easily moved or carried with one hand. Its build quality is better than most Windows laptops below $350. Obviously, there's nothing special about the quality of materials, but everything feels solid, the lid mechanism is sturdy enough, and overall it's not bad at all. It certainly lacks some style, but it looks and feels more expensive than it costs.\nI love Chromebooks for the ease of use. The first set up takes about five minutes. They are perfect for kids, for elderly people unfamiliar with computers, for students, for writers, bloggers or even programmers. It's amazing how much stuff can be done in a browser. Online shopping, social networking, managing emails, listening to music, watching movies, reading books, video chatting - everything that most casual users actually do on their computers and even more. Offline capabilities are not forgotten - you can watch movies from the local or external storage, listen to music, work with Google Docs and many other Chrome apps or even games that can run offline. One of the greatest things about Chrome OS - there is virtually no maintenance. You have to try really hard to make it work wrong. Updates are seamless and a complete reset of the system with the Powerwash, in case you want to give it away or sell it, takes just few minutes.\nI was skeptical when the idea of a Chromebook was introduced to the public. But when I tried one myself and gave it a proper open-minded shot, I wasn't able to go back. Today Acer C720 is my daily driver and I would change it only to a better Chromebook. For $199 it's almost impossible to beat its value. Don't forget, that with the purchase you also get 100 GB of Google Drive space for 2 years. And if you like touchscreens, C720p for $299 is also a very good deal."}

I use my laptop to watch TV, movies or browse the web.\nHe uses his to listen, organize music, and reload his ipod and in general manage his 250 gigs of music.\n\nWhile this Chromebook is great for what I need, its not at all great for my husband, who it was bought for.\n\nNow, I thought \"Oh, it has bluetooth, he should have no problem with his iPod!\" but that wasn't the case. It appears the bluetooth is for things like speakers, and not file transfers. They would not pair up and some research showed it wasn't going to happen.\nI did plug his ipod directly into a USB port, and I could access the ipod but not like we wanted.\nDownloading iTunes was also not happening.\n\nSo, while I would have just used Google Music, my husband is not willing to change his ways, ha! The free Google Music would only let him move 20,000 songs which is about half of what he owns.\n\nSo, unfortunately we will be returning it for a Windows 8 netbook, but I'm considering buying my own Chromebook."}

Surely that was my problem all along, and I would be happy like everyone else. I even put the apple stickers on my car. That $1300 laptop lasted 1 1/2 years. I'm sure I got a lemon, but it had been giving me problems from day one, and finally it just yielded up its expensive spirit.\n\nI couldn't justify buying yet another $1300 laptop, but PC's are no better and I really hate Windows.\n\nSo I decided to get a cheap chromebook, just to get me through the post-holiday financial dry spell and to buy me some time to decide which costly, crappy road I should take - PC or Mac?\n\nMy chromebook arrived in the mail in one day. My expectations were fairly low. I had already used chrome for just about everything. There are just a few programs I use, like excel, but by some fortuitous chance, my company actually switched to a cloud-based accounting program instead of excel. There's actually nothing (right now) that I need another laptop for.\n\nAs others have noted, the case does feel a little cheap. That's probably the only downside. The set up feels very, very user-friendly (if you've been using chrome, then this laptop already feels made just for you!).\n\nIt's super fast, too. When you open the screen, boom. There's your stuff. Are you ADHD like me and you can't focus on 2 or 3 tabs at a time? No problemo. Open up all 12, you multi-tasker. And if you honestly feel like this portal to the land of all-knowingness slows down when you do that, then be reasonable and work with fewer tabs.\n\nThere aren't a whole lot of bells and whistles. If you want to watch cute kitty and puppy videos on youtube, this is your machine. If you need top of the line graphics, keep looking. If you want a loud, bulky, hot laptop, also, keep looking.\n\nThis thing charges FAST! And the battery life is 10-14 hours on a full charge. Go ahead, pick your jaw up off the floor. I was amazed, too.\n\nOverall, if you need a quick little machine that's cute and tiny like a tablet but functional like a laptop, this is your deal. It's also not a bad idea to have if you transport a nice, expensive laptop back and forth from work, school, whatever. You'll probably feel a lot less heartbroken if this one bites the dust!"}

That is why I like the Chromebook. I do not need to deal with a thing. My daughter can play all her online games without causing me any additional computer maintenance.\n\nIf you only need to do web based activities (browsing, email, watching online videos, writing papers, etc.), the Chrome OS is perfect for that. Just the Chrome web browser and no additional software. The operating system itself is a customized Linux distribution, which is well-known for being secure and not always requiring powerful hardware. If there is a problem with the OS, do a factory reset and you will be up and running in no time.\n\nThe size of this laptop is a bit small at 11.6 inches, but good enough for light work.

I also really like the buttons on the top, this doesn't have the F1 - F12 buttson, this has buttons with graphics as to what they do.  Very useful.  I also love  what Google did with the touchpad: 2 Finger scroll, 2 finger snap from right to left goes back, and left to right is forward.  3 Finger snap to either direction switches from one tab to the other, depending on the direction you go.\n\nI also love the full screen mode, and the keyboard itself.  I have been using mine for about a week now and am very happy with the battery life, and the overall feel and ease of use of the ChromeOS.  I have been holding it on my lap and hardly feel any heat after HOURS of heavy usage (youtube videos, documents and such.)\n\nThe main reason I bought this was because I will start a software engineering position soon and wanted to catch up my Java programming skills.  Unfortunately, there is no way to run a traditional IDE like Netbeans or Eclipse on ChromeOS. I tried some of the cloud-based IDE and didn't like it.  The good news is that putting a flavored linux operating system called ChruBuntu is a PIECE OF CAKE.\n\nSo when I need to do some programming, I switch to Linux and start up Eclipse, it works great!\n\nAs for performance, I tend to browse or work with at most 5 tabs, and so far, I am very satisfied.\n\nGreat job Google/Acer!!!

I have to dock a star because the initial setup is impossible if all that is available to connect to is a MAC filtered wireless network as we have in our home.  The wireless MAC number for this device is not listed on the box or the device itself and the setup screen does not allow any exit to determine what the MAC number is (the Continue button is inactive even if 'No network' is selected).  So - the MAC number of the device cannot be determined so it cannot be put in the wireless access point MAC filter table to allow it to connect.  Chat with Acer tech support was useless - they offered suggestions that will not work to determine the MAC address until at least one connection has been made or using keystroke combinations including Function keys that do not exist on the device.\n\nIn the end we went to our local library where there is wireless access but no MAC filtering.  Connection was instantaneous and at that point the network icon (lower right of screen) became visible and usable to determine the MAC address.  So then we could go  back home, feed that into the MAC filter table and we were golden at home, too.  An alternative that might have worked was a  direct wired ethernet connection - the Acer does not have this but using something like a Plugable USB ethernet adapter would probably work to get past the initial setup screen."}

When it first came out, I totally understood the concept but wanted to wait for it to mature a while and the prices to come down. My trigger price point was $200 so when the 2GB version of C720 came out, I had to have one.\n\nI find it amazing that such an inexpensive device can do so much. After having it a week, it became my favorite machine just because it is so simple and light. After using it, you come to question why we need such big computing power, huge hard discs and RAM just to run a traditional OS when it comes to supporting the use cases for about 90% of what you use a PC to do. Whats even better, the Chromebook is pretty much ready to go out of the box, with an already pretty rich supply of online an offline apps don't cost you anything extra.\n\nJust like tablets came on the market and turned the PC industry upside down because they did 80% of a PC did, and did it with a better user experience, lower price with much less hardware spec. In the same way, I think the Chromebook will have a permanent place in personal tech as the one matching basic needs at the cheapest price - a second PC for around the home, or the \"throwaway\" unit for travel where you don't have to worry about damaging or losing it because its both cheap and highly secure.\n\nSpecific to the C720 - I agree with most that the screen could be much better but it is still quite acceptable considering the price. The trackpad and the keyboard as well - I have no trouble using them and the trackpad is actually better than many more expensive PCs. I think the build quality is actually quite good - it looks professional and robust enough so that it can survive a road warrior's abuse.\n\nThe 2GB ram is also the best value in my opinion. I've read a comparison report that showed that the 4GB really has no advantage until you open up 15-20 tabs at once, anything less than that the performance is identical. My own experience (I usually open up only 5 to 10 tabs at once) is that browsing performance is excellent - comparable to my 2013 MacBook Air with 8GB RAM that cost 5x the price."}

I've never owned a chromebook, but I'm so glad I purchased this.\n\nBenefits:\n* Speed - connects to WiFi instantly and runs all web-based tasks as good as my desktop PC.\n* Instant boot up\n* Immediate access to Google Drive, Google Email, etc.\n* Lightweight\n* Battery Life (8.5 hours)\n* Quick charge time (charged very quickly from 82% to full today when I received the product)\n* Chrome Remote Desktop -- this app allows me to connect directly to my desktop PC (which has Windows 7).  The app works very well, and this essentially means that I HAVE FULL ACCESS TO WIN 7 WHENEVER I WANT!\n\nZero cons at this price.  This is now going to be my little workhorse computer.\n\nAcer has really hit this one out of the park.\n\n**UPDATE #1**\n\nI've been using this for a few days now.  I'm still very impressed with this machine.  I really cannot state how great the battery is:  I literally went through almost 2 full days of use with this on a single charge (not continuous use, but off and on for hours at a time for the entire two days).\n\nI also earned 100 GB of free Google space - bringing my total Google Cloud space up to 130 GB (all for free).\n\nI've been speed-testing the WiFi.  The machine achieves excellent speeds (same as my desktop PC).  This may be standard nowadays, but my cell phone and other laptops I've tried often have a slightly inferior WiFi connection.  So I'm happy to report that this thing achieves full speeds over WiFi (and really connects almost instantly to it).\n\nThere are a few things I dislike, but it's not with the machine itself.  Google Docs is missing a few features that I would have assumed standard (e.g., no ability to use a section break).\n\nAlso, I really like Google Chrome Remote Desktop, but there is one issue with the screen flickering when I try to stream StarCraft 2 on my chromebook.  I'm not sure what the reason is, but it may have to do with my desktop PC having two monitors (dual screen).  Not quite sure yet.  Otherwise, Google Chrome Remote Desktop is brilliant!\n\nOne thing I noticed:  If you have multiple email accounts with Google, you'll need to create a separate user to access them.  It's not a bad thing, but it is a necessity.\n\nAnother thing:  There is no \"delete\" key on this keyboard.  That may be standard on laptops, but I used that key all the time on my desktop PC (and I miss it!).\n\nIn sum, I'm still very glad I purchased this Chromebook.  People try to ding things by saying the screen is of poor quality, or that the keyboard is bad, etc.  I DO NOT agree.  The screen looks great to me, and the only thing I can say about the keyboard is that it's a little smaller than a full-sized keyboard (standalone).  But I can type on it just fine (as I'm doing now).\n\nAll in all, a terrific machine at a terrific price!  Still 5/5 for me!\n\nI'm getting ready to travel across the country for approximately 2 weeks.  I will post another update on my experience using it on the go.  Cheers!\n\n**Update #2**\n\nI'm on holiday and recently flew from Ohio to California with a connection in Texas (American Airlines flights).  GoGo in flight WiFi worked and it was FREE!\n\nA few things:\n\n*It only worked from Texas to California (no service from Ohio to Texas)\n\n*The overall speed was very hit or miss.  One second web pages / music would be loading decently, and then it would come to a grinding halt.  This was, admittedly, rather annoying.\n\n*When I had no connection, I noticed that I could still make changes to files I had stored in Google Docs.  For some reason, these files would still open even though I had no internet connection.  I'm very baffled by this, but it's an incredible plus.  Basically, all the changes I made were synced once the connection resumed.  This is an AWESOME feature because it allows me to work despite the lack of an active connection.\n\nOther general thoughts:\n\n*The speed of this chromebook is incredible.  A particularly nice feature is the boot-up time.  If you open the chromebook, it resumes instantly.\n\n*Again, I have to comment on the wicked good battery life.  I cannot remember the last time I charged this device, but I can tell you it was BEFORE I left for vacation, which translates to about 5-7 days.  This is with full time usage during my flight (several hours) and also moderate usage before and after the flight.  As of right now, after about a week of light / moderate use, I've got 22% battery life / about 2 hours left.  WICKED GOOD BATTERY LIFE!\n\n*A pleasure to travel with due to its slim and lightweight design.\n\nI was hoping I'd be getting some more work in during my trip, but we all know how that goes.  I will post another update again in the future.\n\nStill 5/5.\n\n**Update #3**\n\nI've had a few more thoughts since my purchase.  First off, still love this machine in pretty much every possible way.\n\nA minor downside, at the moment, is Google Chrome Remote Desktop.  First off, the app works great FOR THE MOST PART.  However, certain tasks / applications ARE SLOW.  The trouble is that I have not figured out a way to fix this issue.  I'm not sure if it's a hardware issue, a software issue, or a bandwidth issue.  I've tried reducing my color depth and eliminated all visual enhancements on the Win 7 machine, but it hasn't fixed the issue.\n\nI dug around and it turns out that Google seems to be aware of this issue, suggesting that I'm not the only one experiencing this and also that they are currently working to resolve the performance degradation during Chrome Remote Desktop.\n\nThe best way I can describe the performance issues is this:  Laggy.  The cursor will sometimes lag behind, typing will sometimes be delayed, and applications will stutter a bit.  It seems to get worse depending on where I am using my chromebook, which makes me suspect that it might be a bandwidth issue.  Of course, I'm not 100% sure and it may be a combination of things.  I do hope that they resolve the issue sometime soon!\n\nOtherwise, nothing majorly new to report at this time.  It's still a workhorse bargain of a machine as I outlined in my previous reviews, and it's most certainly still one of the best electronics / laptop purchases I've ever made (if not THE best computer purchasing decision I've ever made!).\n\n**Update #4**\n\nQuick tip:  To avoid the loud mouse click when using the trackpad, push down slightly above the left mouse key.  The button will not depress, and thus will not make noise; yet, if you find the sweet spot, you can successfully click the mouse!  :)\n\nI also wanted to say that my GoGo WiFi was much better on my return flights (previously, it was kinda slow and in one leg not even available).\n\nAlso, Google Chrome Remote is great in terms of reliability, but needs to be updated for better speed.  Also, when using Chrome Remote in full screen mode, a really annoying display box telling you you're in full screen mode pops up whenever you hover your mouse near the top of the screen.  This is really ANNOYING and should be eliminated!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I just recently purchased this Google Chromebook and it is AMAZING! Super fast, lightweight, and best battery life of any laptop I have ever used. I switched from using my Macbook Pro because I realized that I all I used on my Macbook Pro was Chrome, iPhoto, and Microsoft Word. With Google + Photos, it assists me in editing photos and keeping them backed up. Google docs was a great replacement for Microsoft Word, especially that it works offline. The battery life is probably one of the best features of this laptop. Consistent browsing has gotten me to about 8 hours of battery life and that includes some YouTube videos and CNN videos. I would definitely recommend this laptop to anyone in school or just does basic web browsing. No set up at all, boots up in seconds and you are online. :) Greatest $199 purchase I have made."}

So far, each time I have been able to use the track pad, and I have been able to reboot the machine. Each time, this has resolved the issue, but I'm still concerned, and a little annoyed.\n\nI've been in contact with Acer and they are paying to have it sent to a repair facility.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "So far, I like my Chromebook a lot, but there are some limitations.\nOn the plus side, it boots from totally cold and off to fully ready, with Chrome browser open, in less than 8 seconds, as advertised. It syncs automatically with my Android phone. I was already a Chrome user on my Windows laptop (much faster and cleaner than IE), so that was no problem. Since I primarily use my Chromebook for email and web-surfing--both of which it does extremely well--I can accomplish most of what I want to do with my Acer resting (lightly) in my lap. And there are lots of free Chromebook apps available to do things such as play games, check the weather, etc.\nHowever...there are limitations, some of which I expected, but not all. For example, you can use Google Docs to produce, open, and work on Office documents, but you don't get the full functionality of Office, such as being able to to password-protect a document, or open a Word document that you previously protected with a password. This should not be a big surprise, since a web-based productivity application will probably never be as fully developed as a full-up suite of applications, though Google indicates they're working on the ability to open a password-protected document. Also, the web-based games (I'm somewhat addicted to Spider Solitaire as a mindless activity that frees me to think about stuff I need to do) just don't work as well or the same way, sadly.\nMore surprisingly, I am unable to print easily (with Google Cloud Print) to my home network printer, a Brother MFC 490CW. The problem is that it is considered a \"classic\" printer, even though it's on my WiFi network, rather than a Cloud Ready printer. That means that in order to install the printer  so that the Chromebook can access it through the Cloud Print server, you have to open up Chrome on a Windows or Mac computer--not the Chromebook!--that is already connected to the printer. Again, no big problem for me, since I already run Chrome on my Windows 7 laptop. BUT...you can only then print from the Chromebook when the other computer (in my case the Windows 7 laptop) is on and online. Apparently the Chromebook sends the print command and data to the Cloud server, which then sends it to the other computer on the printer network, which then send it to the printer. That's a major irritation, since I don't want to keep the other laptop booted up all the time. BTW, you can check the list of available Cloud Ready printers at [...]\nAlso, although it's not that easy to set up, installing the Chrome Remote Access App on your Chromebook AND your other Windows or Mac laptop really does allow you to access and use files and software on your laptop from your Chromebook. Be sure to select \"Open Maximized\" (right click on the Chrome Remote icon in your apps) to be able to use your full Chromebook screen. Of course, that also means leaving your other laptop powered up.\nOverall, very fast, inexpensive, and well-designed, but you need to understand what you're getting."}

It is super simple to set up and use (took me less than five minutes) and I find I'm using it almost all the time instead of my laptop--it is SO MUCH faster!  One of the reasons I hesitated to buy it was because of the size--I was worried about being able to see well with this smaller screen but that hasn't been a problem at all due to sharp high-quality resolution.  Another concern had been typing on the smaller keyboard and that isn't a problem at all.  I find it very comfortable and easy to  use.  Google Docs makes it possible to do word processing without Office (which is much more difficult to use anyway!)  The touchpad/mouse was much easier to use than I expected, too.

Second, there is no \"DELETE\" key which makes editing a real issue. I do like using the google apps but the google programs are at best lousy. It's like Google just through together programs just for the sake of competing. Well they've got a lot of work to do.  I've used Google Docs and it just doesn't have the capabilities of \"Word\" or \"Open Office\". I know it's supposed to be a benefit not to have to \"SAVE\" a document, but sometimes I go into a program and back out but it stays on my list as a \"untitled doc or presentation\". The Google app that replaces SKYPE is functionally flawed.  It would take several pages of notes to enumerate all the bugs in \"DOCS\", \"Presenter\", and \"Spreadsheet\" programs. The overall functionality of the ACER is great, with the exception of the lack of a \"DELETE\" Key.  I love the solid state drive which makes computing quick and easy.

I'll admit, the smaller form factor has taken me a few days to get used to but that's a minor adjustment I'm quickly adapting to. I can't believe how well Netflix runs on this baby. No buffering at all! Works almost seamlessly with the Chromecast adapter and my flat screen. Yeah, it's made of plastic, but hardly as ugly as the dozens of other hulking laptops currently on the market. If you drop it, it will probably break. So will an Ipad or any other electronic device. The display is more than adequate. No glare. The matte screen is much easier on the eyes and looks as good as most other current laptops, but I'm highly biased towards this type of screen since I spend a great deal of time staring at it. Speed. I bought the 2 Mb version with some reservations, but haven't had any problems at all staying connected or having multiple page open at the same time. I don't use my Chromebook for business, but I do rely quite heavily on Google docs. It's a fantastic, stripped down, easy to use word processor that is way more useful than Microsoft Word has ever been for me. Bottom line; this Chromebook does what it says it's supposed to do. It's the first computer that's ever done that for me right out of the box.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "Very satisfied with the Chromebook from Acer! This is my first chromebook, and I use it as a secondary laptop in addition to my MacBook Pro. Here I list several pros and cons from my 3-day experience:\n\nPros:\n1. Battery: I am very surprised that the battery lasts so long compared to any PC or MacBook, probably even longer than advertised. Also it charges very fast.\n2. Style: Before I got this chromebook, I thought maybe its style is not as attractive as the new HP 11. However, I completely changed my mind when I opened the box. The Acer C720 has a very nice looking outside, and the weight is very light.\n3. Apps: There are so many apps in the Chrome Store that meet all my needs.\n4. Sound: The speakers are pretty good. For running multiple tabs, you hardly hear any noise from the inside of the chromebook. Very quite.\n5. Remote control: Make sure to check out the Chrome Remote Desktop (or alternative apps). It is pretty easy to get control of my MacBook Pro. You just need a PIN number to get the access.\n\nCons:\n1. Skype: I knew beforehand that Skype is not supported in Chrome OS. I do hope that there could be a Skype app in the near future. Though Google Hangouts is awesome, some people may still want to have Skype at hand.\n2. Touchpad: when I click on the touchpad, I hear a crispy sound that I dislike. That sound may make the chromebook feel \"cheap\" in quality, but that is the only aspect that I am a little disappointed. Again, for the $199 price, I should not ask for more and more :)\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this Acer C720 chromebook to those who are considering a secondary laptop besides the working computer."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "First, the hardware.\n\nI have two Macbook Pro machines (a 2009 and a 2010 model), so I have relatively high standards. This is not Apple quality, but it is superior to most cheap Windows machines and far superior to netbook machines.\n\nThe overall build is 4-star. The keyboard is decent, and short of being backlit, it is almost on-par with Apple's chicklet keyboard. Vs Apple's chicklet keyboard, it has slightly less travel and a different texture, but it is very usable.\n\nThe machine itself is solid: it doesn't flex and creak like most cheap machines. It is quite rigid and feels solid for a plastic notebook. It isn't as ugly as photos lead you to believe.\n\nThe trackpad is nice. It is not as flawless as an Apple trackpad, but is responsive and works well. It supports two-finger scrolling (windows-style or \"natural\"). It also supports navigating forward and back with two fingers, although this gesture is definitely less responsive than with Apple's trackpad. The whole trackpad is a button, just like a Mac. You can choose whether to tap-to-click, or not.\n\nThe big (huge) weakness is the display. Resolution isn't horrible compared to a non-retina Mac, but contrast is pretty bad. Unless you tilt the C720's screen perfectly, contrast is abysmal. I would gladly have paid more if it had a better display. It is the one thing that makes me regret this purchase, even at the low price.\n\nBattery life is great. I used this machine earlier this week with streaming music in the background and working on documents for work. It had 20% left after 7 hours.\n\nAs is clearly stated in the description, this machine contains an OS that simply runs Google Chrome. You can get a great idea of what works and what does not by simply testing tasks in Google Chrome on a Mac, PC, or Linux box.\n\nIt is surprising what can be done with just a browser. It isn't perfect, but you can do a lot.\n\nBelow are some of my normal tasks, and how well they can be accomplished with the Chromebook C720.\n\nBrowsing: flawless. It is full-featured Google Chrome, and it is fast and responsive. It doesn't choke on any web sites or even web apps that I have found. It can handle ten tabs easily (2gb model).\n\nCreating simple MS office documents: decent. It can create basic office documents (docs, spreadsheets, presentations) and export them for use in MS office.\n\nEditing simple Microsoft Office files: fair. It works with simple spreadsheets and documents. It can \"view\" simple Powerpoint files.\n\nIt isn't great at handling complex MS office files with lots of formatting. You can probably get by in a pinch, but you will occasionally struggle and there are files you will encounter that just won't work at all.\n\nI do not have a subscription to the new \"MS Office 365\" cloud apps, so I can't speak to how well it handles them. If it works as well as Apple's cloud office apps, you should have no problems with Office 365.\n\nEdited to add: I tried Microsofts free trial of Office 365. Chrome's web office apps are just as powerful as Microsoft's web apps (though Apple iWork web apps are more powerful than both). The big difference between Microsoft web apps and Chrome web apps is the interface. The MS Office 365 interface is similar to modern MS Office with the big toolbar at the top. Google Chrome web office app interface is simpler and more like Office '97. Neither are super-powerful and I actually prefer Google Chrome's we apps to Microsoft's web apps. The Chrome apps make better use of screen real estate. Neither of them can display heavy formatting found in complex documents.\n\nApple iWork files (Pages, Keynote, and Numbers): great, using Apple's iWork for iCloud. iCloud will warn you that the browser is not supported, but it works great. It works just as well as it does using Chrome or Safari on a Mac. It can't import your iWork files into the offline software, so Apple iWork is a cloud-only online-only option.\n\nAmazon Prime Video: failure. It simply does not work at this time (12/7/13)\nEdited to add: now Amazon Prime Video works fine. ??? Perhaps Amazon had some issue or the machine updated itself, but it works fine now.\n\nNetflix: works great.\n\nNetwork storage using the file manager: failure. There is no way to easily connect to my home NAS server or shared folders on other machines on the network using the file manager.\n\nNAS access using the browser interface: great. I have a Synology Diskstation NAS. I can watch movies, play music, and download files using the web-based interface just fine.\n\nVPN access: failed (using my work VPN). It does have a VPN setup built in, but doesn't work with my company VPN. My company VPN works fine on iPhone, iPad, and almost any computer. This is a big drawback that Google needs to fix.\n\nPrinting: decent. I have an HP printer that is fully supported and it prints great (HP Officejet 7500). HP \"eprint\" printers have an email address and you just give the C720 this address for printer access. I have heard that it struggles with some printers, but I can't speak to it. The print command brings up a dialog to export your file/image/webpage/etc as a PDF file by default.\n\nPhoto viewing/editing: very mixed, and mostly awful when offline. One reason I wanted this device was to carry with me along with my camera to view photos on the go. It does have a full-size SD slot (though the card protrudes from the machine and can't be left in the slot for long). The built-in offline image \"editor\" is a joke. It can only view files fitted to the screen. It can do extremely simple tasks like cropping and brightness adjustment, and that's it. You can't even zoom in on an image to inspect it closely with the built-in photo app. With difficulty, I found an offline image editor app called \"Pixir Touch Up\" that does a much better job, and will allow you to zoom in on images from your SD card, but it isn't much better than the stock app. Pixir does offer a very full-featured online photo editor that is on-par with Gimp and others. Remember, the display isn't great and isn't ideal for inspecting photos. An iPad and an EyeFi card (or iPad camera connection kit) are a much better choice for toting along on a photography adventure. Even though the display is poor, it's too bad that Google did such a lousy job with the photo app.\n\nGoogle Chromecast: great! It works well with my Chromecast. It works just as well as when using Chrome on my Mac.\n\nEase of use: decent. If you already have Chrome on a Mac/Linux/PC, you know how to use it. All of you settings, bookmarks, and everything else in Chrome on a Mac just downloads right into the Chromebook.\n\nGoogle Drive storage: fantastic! This machine includes 100GB of Google Drive storage. Google charges $5/month for this great service and Dropbox charges twoce as much for similar service. I am Going to cancel my 100GB Dropbox and save $10/month for two years, which essentially makes this machine free. If you don't know about syncing files between your computers using Google Drive, you need to check it out. It is a bargain at $5, and a steal when free with a usable computer.\n\nThe machine itself with the current software is a three star item, but it is a great value. It isn't as high-quality as a Macbook or a modern tablet, but it is so cheap that it should be a consideration if you simply cannot afford a high-end machine, or you need a backup machine. It is better than many Windows machines I have used that cost more than twice as much. It would be 4-star-plus with a better display, better file manager, better network support, and better photo viewer/editor. Hopefully Google keeps working on it and eventually upgrades the weaknesses in the software."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "The Acer C720 is the perfect laptop for students. I just bought this chromebook from Best Buy primarily because I wanted something light and compact to carry around campus. I have a Windows laptop that's fully loaded with a SSD, Core i7, 8gb ram, etc. All of that is fast but my laptop weights nearly 7 pounds and honestly those specs are overkill for what I need. I'm a biochem major so I don't need fancy AutoCAD or photoshop programs. All I need is document editing, browser, and a PDF viewer.\n\nThe first thing I tried once I bought this little guy was opening up my PDF textbooks. I put the text books on my flashdrive, transferred them to the onboard storage and it worked! The textbooks open up offline in Chromes PDF viewer. It's brilliant! That was my main concern. I uploaded my entire iTunes library (about 4,000 songs) on to Google Music. It took several hours to upload but now I have all of my music on the cloud and it's ALWAYS with me. Yes, you will need an internet connection to listen to it but my campus has wifi everywhere. I even get connection outside between buildings.\n\nIn terms of hardware, this chromebook is much thinner in person than it appears in the pictures. It is also quite a bit smaller than I was expecting but that's not a bad thing. The keyboard is slightly smaller than I would like and the keys are extremely shallow. It doesn't bother me but it'll take me a little bit to get used to. People have been saying that the trackpad is loose but I don't find that the case. I actually find it rather pleasant to use and it has many gestures that come on Apple computers. The screen is awesome on this. Sure it's not an IPS but this matte display has ample brightness, clarity, and size. I quite enjoy it. The speakers were surprising. I was expecting something sub par but for a $199 laptop, they really deliver. The bass could be stronger but I think they sound nice as they are. Lastly, the batter is awesome! The computer had no charge when I got it but it took less than an hour to charge to 100% once I plugged it in. When I unplugged it, it should 9:42 till empty! WOW! That's with two tabs open.\n\nFor those wondering how the 2gb compares to the 4gb, I've got to say that the 4gb is overkill unless you open more than 30 tabs some of which are all playing video at the same time. Who does that though? I typically have 4-5 open. Occasionally, I could get up to 10 but that doesn't slow this machine down at all. I'm glad I went with the 2gb as I would never find use for the extra 2 gb of ram.\n\nThis is definitely a great buy. I was really hesitant for about a month. I just couldn't decide but with Best Buys holiday return policy, I decided to give it a try. I definitely will not be returning this. In fact, I think I will be using this way more than my Windows laptop."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "Alright, I will try and get every aspect I can get off the top of my head here. I ordered this having done my research, and I am not disappointed. This is a web based machine meant to surf the web, attack college papers (or any paper, work document, you get the idea). If you are looking for a machine that can run all of your gaming needs and software, you might want to pass this up.\n\nThe Chrome OS is extremely user friendly and simple. There is no clutter or confusion on where anything on your computer is. It's a fast little machine and will get me to my amazon account, ebay, paypal, facebook, all of that. IT DOES NOT CURRENTLY SUPPORT SKYPE. I read up on a lot of complaints about that and wanted to make that clear. Although there is a way around almost anything, a skype app directly usable on the Chrome OS does not currently exist. I will update if/when it becomes available. For now, though, you have to use Google's Hangouts app or a third party app. There is also a good amount of storage with the free google drive and solid state drive. Invest in a flash drive or SD card for extra storage.\n\nNow the build of the PC. A lot of people complain about the keyboard and track pad which are fair enough arguments, but for $199 I expected a lot worse. Of course it's something to get used to, but that's most computers. The speakers are what I expected, not incredible but fine, you can run an aftermarket set of speakers if you need to. The screen build is great, it doesn't seem easily breakable at all and the 720p HD is just fine if you aren't in dire need of 1080. Just take care of your electronics. For the price, I say GET THIS.\n\nThere is a USB 2.0 and 3.0 slot in this PC, along with HDMI, SD, and headphone slot. This allows for dual monitoring, easy transfer of files, and headset use. I run an Amazon Basics USB extension and am able to run my USB headset, keyboard, mouse, and flash drive no problem. The built in webcam and microphone are also fine for video and audio calls. The startup and shutdown times are also phenomenal. It starts up (like advertised) 7 seconds and sometimes less, and shuts down in about 2 seconds.\n\nTo conclude, if you want a great little machine that runs faster than lightning strikes, get this no doubt. It's great for a college student like myself, or an avid internet surfer. Stick to your gaming PCs if you are into that sort of thing, but this is a cheap, fun little computer."}

Decent speakers; not the greatest in the world, but better than one would expect\n5. Great Keyboard; took no time at all to adapt to it\n6. Great Battery Life\n7. Easy Setup\n8. Sensitive track-pad with intuitive gestures\nCons\n1. Plastic near track pad caves in slightly under pressure\n2. Screen usable but certainly not desirable\n3. Chrome OS lacks native torrent support\n\nThis laptop is more attractive looking than other reviewers say. I would not be ashamed of having this laptop in public; it is not ugly in the least, albeit a bit neutral in looks. The search button on the keyboard that is located where the caps lock should be is very useful and allows you to quickly access any applications on the device. The track pad is the best of any laptop that I have ever had my paws on. The two finger gestures are highly intuitive and easy to use. Accepting the 100 GB of included Google drive storage was very easy due to the setup guide. I have yet to run into any trouble with the 2 GB ram allowance.\n\nI recommend this laptop most for students looking to take notes and be able to casually browse the web. Google Drive has developed to the point that it makes a viable replacement to Microsoft Office for light document, spreadsheet, and power-point creation. I expect it will only continue to improve. Knowing that the OS will be kept virus free and up to date is very assuring. I am happy with my purchase.\n\n12/31/13\nOne thing that I am particularly disappointed with is the that Chromebook lack the ability to connect to local networks and stream content. For a device that is designed to be a wireless experience, I find this to be a grave hindered in its usage. I didn't buy the device for consuming media, I just wish that the chrome experience wasn't as locked down as it is."}

This is strictly Chrome, which means that you cannot use any type of microsoft or skype programming. You cannot play any PC games either, because this is technically not a PC, and does not support games. (Not that that was my main concern, just throwing it in there!) I have never dropped my computer or mishandled it in any way. Im very gentle and take good care of all my electronics, so needless to say when my screen started messing up out of no where, I was not happy. One day when I turned my computer on the screen had lines going all through it, and now its only gotten worse. Along the edges there is big black blobs where its just missing, and it is also \"staticy\" in places. It does have a year long warranty on it, but when I called I could not get a hold of any one that could speak proper English, and I was too frustrated to care any more. I decided to give it to my little brother who would only use it for YouTube, and I am buying myself a Surface Tablet. It does its job for which its made for, but there is not a lot of great qualities about it. If you want a good quality computer, spend a little more and get one! Just because this is a \"steal\" at 250, does not mean you should jump on it. You get what you pay for, and I recommend getting something a little more expensive knowing that It will last a LOT longer than the Chromebook."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "For those looking for a great and inexpensive laptop, this is it. I have been a Chromebook fan since the early days and find this a great entry level unit.\n\nPros:\n-Great battery life (real world 6-7 hours)\n-Faster then Samsung or HP Arm Processor\n-Small and light\n-They improved on color and design slightly (less plasticy- more metal looking then 710, but still wish it was more premium)\n\nCons-\n-Screen (both in quality, and size). Now realize I might be a little biased on this one. I have a few of the Samsung Arm Chromebooks for the kids, and I own a Chromebook Pixel. I recently bought a Mac Air (to do more developer things), and had to return it because the screen just does not cut it for me (after using the Pixel). I got a Macbook Pro to find the screen to my liking. So if you are coming from any retina type screen, this will be harder to adjust to. Otherwise, what more can you ask for in a $199 notebook.\n-Design is still a little on cheap end, too large of bezel\n-Speakers have OK volume, but Bass is distorted at higher volume\n\nSuggestions (not specifically for this model, but Chromebooks in general):\n-ACER (or Asus, Samsung, or Toshiba - you still have a chance to surprise us in early 2014), there IS a market for a little nicer unit. This is what I would change on this (and any lower end chromebook).\n\n1) The bezel is a little too large. Seems they could of pushed 12.1 or 12.6 out of same form factor by reducing bezel.\n2) Go IPS, HP 11 is a beautiful screen (too bad they couldn't of put a Haswell in that one).\n3) Love the Micro USB charger of the HP 11 (although not sure if that was part of recall of that model).\n4) Must be Haswell type power with 8+ hours of battery life\n5) Must be under 3 lbs.\n6) Sound through keyboard\n7) Backlit keyboard\n8) Metalish look please, and sturdy frame. Not a huge fan of the polished plastic look that HP went back to in the 11. Reminds me of the first series 3 Samsung I owned. Maybe even going leatherish feel with aluminum trim (like the first Nexus 7) gave off a professional look while keeping costs lower.\n\nWhile I understand almost 2 of every 3 units going out the door is for education, you would like to see one company step up to make a in-between model. For those of us that own the Pixel, we are disappointed in a battery that cannot perform past 3 hours making it almost useless in some cases. Someone should be able to make a great model like above in that $299-$399 price range."}

Not being able to fully use the valuable resources from Coursera with the Acer Chromebook is very disappointing."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FNPD1VW", "review": "I've had just a couple of days with the Acer C270 2GB Chromebook, but so far, I'm more than highly impressed and pleased with it. For about $200, it's a steal, I think. You can't beat the convenience of such a light unit for browsing, emails, doc creation and editing.\n\nI love the chicklet keyboard, which provides good feedback, despite the limited key motion. I'm slowly mastering the differences with combined keys, which vary from the Windows that I'm used to, but I've been able to find combos to do everything I want to do on it.\n\nAudio is louder that on most portables I've used, and sound quality is pretty decent. The screen is fine, biased a bit on the cold/blue side, but satisfactory, and the text is crisp and easy to read.\n\nI haven't experienced any lag issues at all, but I also haven't tried to activate more than about 7 tabs at a time, so far.\n\nThe only slight negative I've encountered is that the SDCard connection is not recessed, so that the inserted card sticks out on the side of the unit, vulnerable to damage. I had intended to plug a 32GB card in more or less permanently, but that is not a practical option, unfortunately. The free 100 GB of Google Drive space (for 2 years), is a viable alternative for the SDCard, and the Chromebook is optimized to provide very direct and quick access to Drive, so it's very much just like having the space directly in the unit, as long as an internet connection is available.\n\nAll in all, I would highly recommend the unit to anyone, as long as they understand what it is intended to do, and that it isn't a conventional app based, touch-screen tablet device."}

I am a huge Google fanatic and do whatever I can online so I thought a Google Chromebook was the way to go for me. I am able to do literally anything I need to do on it. It is very fast, runs great and with the use of Google Chrome apps I can carry out my daily tasks very well.\n\nI like the efficiency of doing everything online and not having to update or install programs, which would naturally slow the computer down. I also like that since it gets auto updates from Google every 6 weeks and no programs can actually be installed on the machine, there is literally a 0% chance of ever getting a virus.\n\nUp until it recently stopped working, I was able to use Arc Welder to sideload individual Android applications onto the Chromebook, which I never knew until I did it last year. This Chromebook will never receive support for the Google Play Store, but even so, I am greatly satisfied with what I got out of this.\n\nJust a little tip: use a browser extension called uBlock Origin, it will make it run so much faster. I have a 3 Mbps Download / 1 Mbps Upload inernet connection from Time Warner and can still stream music, videos, and even live TV on a regular basis. I use this is my \"port for entertainment.\"\n\nJust a word of warning, the battery is terrible. This computer is advertised to get 8.5 hours of battery life, instead I only get about 5 hours on a good day and that's with me turning off the WiFi during sleep mode and dimming my brightness below 50% most of the time. I don't use Bluetooth at all either.\n\nI was a little disappointed in the battery as the long battery life was why I got this particular one, but since that's the only problem I've had with it, I am still greatly satisfied with my choice to get an Acer c720 Chromebook. It will last you a long time, does what you need it to do and you will get your money's worth.\n\nThe Chromebook End of Life Policy (where Google stops guaranteeing updates for a particuar Chromebook model) is November 2018 for this particular Chromebook and after that, I plan to keep using it and eventually wipe out the Chrome OS and install Ubuntu Linux on it and potentially use it for another 4-5 years. I also have a screen cleaner and a can of air which helps make it look new.\n\nUPDATE: The End of Life Policy for this particular Chromebook has recently been changed to June 2019, so I will use this Chromebook for at least an extra year and a half before I have to think about taking action."}

So for most of my three years of ownership, I used Ubuntu, since the upstream kernel drivers were much better.\n\nI recently switched back to ChromeOS recently to see if the situation had improved, and luckily, it has.\n\nSo that's 1.5 stars off right there -- the Wifi NIC was already correct, all the people at Google had to do was compile the right drivers into the damn thing. Its sole purpose is to go on the Internet so Google can profit off of all of our traffic/data right?\n\nI'm also subtracting half a star because the touchpad is pretty bad (even under ChromeOS).
