{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00G2X1VIY", "review": "Don't believe all the reviews out there saying the ipad Air is the better tablet. Those reviews are biased and only bring up the minor upgrades from the old ipad and base the comparisons off of those few things. And the only two really bad things they had to say about the ipad Air was that it didn't have a fingerprint scanner and it didn't come in gold. The 80's called and they want their gaudy flashy gold bling back.\n\nMost of these reviews will only focus on those points and will not mention all the other advantages the Surface 2 has. And for the few reviews that do mention the other features the Surface 2 has, they still favor the ipad because the camera was nicer or more apps. Really?\n\nI will use the Surface 2 as comparison because it will show how ridiculous the bias is regardless of capabilities.\n\nWhat the reviews usually leave out or down play.\n\nSurface 2\n\n1. Full office software. Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote.\n2. Wide screen optimized for wide screen movies. When held in portrait when you are surfing the web for example, you get a a longer list so you don't scroll as much.\n3. Sd slot. Easy to download or upload data on the fly.\n4. 3.0 USB so you can easily backup files to a hard drive and not have all your eggs in one basket. Or transfer files with anything that has a USB plug and also charge your phone. Ipad? No, unless you have the adapter and you can't charge your phone.\n5. Can print to almost every printer.\n6. Hdmi port\n7. Flash support so you are not limited browsing the web.\n8. Built in two position kickstand.\n9. Thin keyboards that double as covers. Can get them background lit, flat, with real keys, and a new one coming out with\n built in battery to recharge your Surface at the same time on a charge. Battery in tablet is good already though. Some say that you need to buy a keyboard to make full use of the Surface and adds to the cost. Ridiculous. You do not. It will make life more easier though if you are working on a spreadsheet or word document. With an ipad you don't need one because what use would it be for? Sure there are apps. but they are limited to what you can create or edit. You have to do major creating and editing on a computer first and then hook up the ipad and transfer it.\n10. Hook up to your t.v. or another monitor and drag an open window to the second screen.\n11. Do a split screen on the tablet.\n12. Run multiple tasks at the same time in the background like listening to music, watching a video and doing something\n else like typing an email or working on an a office document in split screen mode.\n13. Wirelessly sync with your xbox and play games on your t.v, stream videos, pictures, etc.\n14. Drag and drop files.\n15. Can set up individual separate accounts on the tablet and have parental monitoring updates and deciding what child can do on the tablet.\n\nNow these are not all the Surface 2 offers. I am finding new things still.\n\nThe ipad Air is basically the same ipad as before with minor tweaks. It's faster and lighter. Still does the same thing as before, nothing new.\n\nipad Air\n\n1. Powerful processor. For doing nothing new. Future fingerprint scanner? Tablet will still only run apps. as before.\n2. Lighter and thinner is negated by the cases to protect the ipad and without a keyboard.\n3. Upgraded camera. Put it down, your annoying the people behind your trying to see the wedding or play. Use a real camera.\n4. No USB or sd slot. Need adapters for just about everything. And with the Surface 2 you can plug the unit in when it is dead and keep on using it and still do things via the sd card or usb cables. On an ipad you can't do both. You either charge it or plug in an adapter to the only port the ipad has do to something. And if it is dead, you have to wait until you charge it first. Also you need to bring all the adapters and keyboard with you vs the Surface 2 of which all you need is the power cable. And the cover/keyboard is so thin it is negligible in bulk and weight. And justifying that the ipad has third party keyboards is not valid. It is a separate bulky keyboard and the ipad does not support mouse functions. You are stuck with third party hardware that is Apple specific whereas with the Surface you can use anything that supports micro SD or USB. And having to buy all these accessories tofor the ipad.will not be cheap. People gripe about the Suface cover/keyboard costs too much. Well to buy a seperate cover for an ipad will cost $40.00 and it will flop around and a non intergrated keypad will cost $100.00 that you have to carry seperatley.\n5. Having to convert simple files with Apple software a hassle.\n5. Tons of apps. Android not far behind. And Microsoft growing. How much apps. does one need?\n6. What good is the Reina display if it isn't widescreen? Picture is actually smaller than 9.7 with the black bars.\n7. Only compatible with Apple products i.e. cant print unless it is an AirPrint printer or stream to t.v. unless Apple t.v.\n8. Slightly upgraded camera. Put it away! Your blocking my view! And people with a 4.8 inch phone look ridiculous? At least they are not carrying around the perfect sized iphone for one handed operation along with a 9.6 tablet that takes two hands. Kind of contradicting.\n\nThe ipad Air has more negatives than positives, so how can it be better? Android tablets have more features even than the ipads. I guess if you want one just for games and apps, then an ipad or a higher end Android tablet might suit your needs. People are not weighing in that the Surface 2 can do more than just play games.\n\nNow back to the Surface 2. There was a slight learning curve to understand what all the gestures do. It didn't take long though. Look it up on youtube and you will pick it up real quick along with a lot of tips and tricks of what it is capable of. There different ways to open, close, move, split screen, multitask, etc.\n\nThe tablet feels a little heavy in the hand if you had to hold it I admit. But the two position kickstand works pretty good on the lap as I didn't think it would. I don't have to have a cover to add to the bulk to double as a kickstand also. And even if I put on one of the super thin keyboards they would add very little weight or bulk and they snap on and off without any hassle.\n\nThe boot up time takes a little while when completely off, but remember it is opening real office programs. When in sleep mode it opens up quickly.\n\nI went several days at a time of casual use and in sleep mode without charging and it still had a charge.\n\nThe tiles are nice because it is real time data so I can glance at them without opening up an app. for email, weather, etc. On Apple you have a bunch of icons and you have open it up, Android you can use widgets.\n\nWith a real browser and Flash I can use full websites rather than a mobile version. And also it is a lot easier to open multiple tabs when surfing the internet unlike some tablets where it is a pain to pop back and forth between tabs.\n\nAs I mentioned above it is nice to have the split screen because my kids can research on the web on one side and write their paper on the other side while listening to music of which they shouldn't be.\n\nThe only two cons I find on the Surface 2 so far is that the power cord is only about 58 inches long. You have to be really close to an outlet of some sort.\n\nAnd the main con was that the software and backup takes up about 16 gigs so you don't have the full gigs of memory stated. So might have to get an sd card. Yes other tablets you only lose about 2 gigs, but remember they are pretty much entertainment tablets only and can't do what the Surface 2 can do.\n\nIf you are waiting for a ipad Air Pro to come out. Don't be surprised if it doesn't come with a Retina display, finger print scanner, nice camera, etc. You will have to wait for the Pro S, Pro S1, etc. to get one feature at a time and not several at once. I mean come on, cant even throw in a simple camera flash. The ipads shouldn't even be placed in the categories of tablets that can run Office software. There should be a category for Dumb Tablets that only run apps, a category for Smart Tablets for those that can run fully functioning office software and not just limited mobile versions, and Extreme Tablets for ones that can run full blown Office suites.\n\nIf your a die hard Apple fan, please back up your arguments with something valid other than ipad rocks or a childish angry comment. Because if you do, it will prove my point."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00G2X1VIY", "review": "When the first iPad was released in the spring of 2010, it was accompanied by a cacophony of jokes about its name and its size. Three and a half years later, the release of the iPad Air, the fifth full-size tablet Apple has offer, has been much calmer. This is the fourth full-size iPad I have owned, beginning with the AT&T 3G model which was released in May, 2010, about a month after the first WiFi only iPads arrived. Every one of my iPads has had an AT&T cellular data.\n\nUntil this model I have purchased the largest capacity solid state drive Apple has offered. This year there is a 128GB iPad, which costs about $100 more than my 64GB model. Here is the reason I did not select the higher capacity-iCloud. Data stored on iCloud is instantly available across multiple IOS and OSX devices. With all that storage (I buy 50GBs annually) why duplicate it on a hard disk?\n\nThe iPad Air is incredibly light(about a pound) and has a slightly smaller external footprint than previous models. The retina display actually seems sharper, if such a thing is possible. It also holds a charge for even longer than before.\n\nBeyond the physical beauty of the iPad Air is its amazing utility. As a trial lawyer I can easily access the firm's network. This means that  every file and every document is instantly at my command. In just a few years time I have learned that I no longer need to drag loads of paper files and depositions with me to court.\n\nOver 400,000 apps are built exclusively for iPad, and well over a million iPhone apps run on my device as well. It is an incredibly powerful platform, well on its way to replacing laptops for all but the most labor intensive tasks. When I travel, I typically bring only my iPad-no laptop, no hard copy of a file.  I didn't really appreciate just how dependent I had become on the iPad until this June when a federal judge held that  I could bring  either a laptop or a tablet into the courthouse. I chose the iPad.\n\nMy weapon of choice-the iPad. This is the one tablet to buy if you are serious about using a tablet. It's pricy, but it may well be, the perfect tablet."}

It's easily portable, has a light display on one side so you can better see where your apple and knife is, and sometimes (if you're lucky) some glass shards will sneak their way into your food and add a nice crunch. However, I'm not sure why it's just limited to cutting apples. I think it may work for other things like carrots and celery, but I don't think the results will be as good. It also frequently asks for updates, which I find useless and annoying. But certainly this high-end kitchen appliance is worth the $400 and I can see why it's so popular."}

I'm used to Android, but I do like the screen and the speakers are great! I'm still in the learning stage, but then I just got it yesterday. I even got a pretty Rose Gold case for it, on Amazon as well for $8.99!  I got the 32g, that's enough for me. YouTube has video tutorials if you need any help. I enjoyed watching them. They have very good tips and information. Overall this is an excellent purchase!"}

In less than a year the battery would no longer charge beyond around 40% I spent an agonizing 3 or 4 hours waiting at the Apple store to talk to a \"genius\". After some testing they decided that the battery was no good and gave me a new iPad. All well and good except that now, 4 months later, the second one is doing the same thing. Only now they won't honor the warranty. Apple is selling these things knowing full well that the batteries are bad. I suspect that they hope you will just shut up and buy another one. As for me, I will never buy another Apple product. If I'm going to buy a disposable-after-one-year tablet I'll buy something for $100."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00G2X1VIY", "review": "Bought this for my parents. 78 years old. Purchased a protective cover and installed it on the iPad for them. Next time I show up, the screen is cracked. Well they took it out of the protective cover and let a grandchild use it. The iPad is great, the parents need some training. They purchased their first computer a couple of years ago. I have been a computer teacher for the past 23 years. My mom finally wanted an iPad because women from her church were using them. I spent two days, a couple of hours each day showing my mom and dad how to use it. They seem not to have time during the day to use it. My recommendation to those who are purchasing it for a family member over the age of 75 with no computer experience is....probably not. But if you want a device for a 5 year old, this is your device!"}

I did some research and Apple officially discontinued the Air model earlier this year, hence the low prices!

This iPad could pass as new unless you really stare at it.  Screen is perfect.\n\nInternally: All features work!  Not only that, I used iBackupBot to view the charge cycles (the amount of times the battery is discharged/recharged) to find it was a low 63.  The battery capacity, measured by the same tool, is at 97% of factory state - practically new.\n\nI'll update this review if something changes, but right now I am a thoroughly satisfied customer.

I recently purchased the iPad Air only because some apps I use had new features that require an A6 chip or higher.  The price for this was good but I am disappointed in the touch response.  Most notably is when I try to slide up the control center from the bottom of the screen.  It doesn't always work, as in frequently doesn't work.  I end up having to go to settings.  I loved the swipe up when it came out as I frequently toggle wifi off and on to save battery.  Also note, the device gets very warm, almost hot, after a few hours use.  I will keep it for my special apps but going to hold on to my workhorse, reliable iPad 2.  (Have not had any issues with the iPad mini)."}

I bought the Ipad Air so I could subscribe to the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal and read those on my trip.  I was unable to make any purchases.  I was referred to Apple Support.  After three hours on the phone with them, they had to \"escalate the problem to engineering ... which will take another 24 hours\".  In the process of trying to set things up and order the two subscriptions to these papers, I must have entered my password 35 times or more.  Every time I turned around, it asked for my password again.  I am truly sorry  ever bought this POS.  I am going on my trip with the free trials of the NY Times and Wall Street Journal, and I still do not know if I will ever be able to subscribe to them.  In my research online, I found thousands of posts on various forums of people with the same problem.  I am really really sorry I bought this."}

It's fast, simple to use, and takes pretty decent photos.\nI've had it now for about two years, and I'm a lot less happy. My laptop is out of order right now, so this is my only means of using the internet, but it's unreliable. It doesn't have much storage AT ALL.\nThe past few days, simple things like Facebook and Google image search will crash it. I've been deleting photos and apps to make room, but it doesn't seem to last long. The few apps I don't want to delete are unpredictable as to wether they'll crash it or not.\nReally? You couldn't make one tiny space for an SD card?\nBesides that, the battery gets hot sometimes, and I worry what will happen about that. There's no way to get in there and replace it, so that's another problem.\nAnd you probably know about the charging cord problem already, what with them splitting open and all.\n\nThis product was easy to get attached to, but they're made to break."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00G2X1VIY", "review": "For a refurbished iPad for our 9 yr old son this was a great buy! It did have some dents and dings on it but that's to be expected. Even the seller admits that it may have some. We bought a Supcase to protect it and so all those dents/dings are hidden anyways. The iPad works great. Only issue is that the charging cord that came with it doesn't seem to stay connected. It has to be finessed into place for it to actually charge. Not sure if this is the cord or the iPad. If it weren't for the charging issue, this product would have received 5 stars."}

Light and easy to carry arround with a functional bluetooth connection for keyboards and the like gives incredibly understated power to the ipad air 1.

Yes, it is faster than the earlier model, but it freezes and locks up on videos way more often than the 2.  It also has an issue with videos continuing to play audio in the background after you have shut down the video and you can't shut it off without closing the entire window. Never had that problem on the iPad 2.  It seems that Apple is not really improving the newer models since Jobs passed away. Everything just seems like cosmetic improvements over real improvements."}

The iPad with its dual antenna design has no such issue. The Apple tablet also handles streaming music and videos better. Games and apps for the iPad are also much more polished. The iPad display is marvelous with deep rich colors and superb resolution too. Battery life is impressive. I got over 13 hours use on a charge.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00G2X1VIY", "review": "I have found my iPad Air to be useful for so many different reasons. As a college student, the size and weight have made it very convenient for me to carry to class, and the 10 hour battery life allows me to use it all day without worries. The app store is another amenity that I really enjoy, offering over one and a half million apps, it provides almost anything you could want. With sixteen gigabits of space, I have been able to download several different apps for a variety of different things without coming close to my maximum space.\n\nBeing a college student with a heavy lap top that has a short battery life, I was tired of lugging mine around everywhere I went. My iPad has allowed me to access the internet for class notes and slides at a fraction of the size. The long lasting battery has made it so I can get through a whole day of classes without needing a charger or dealing with the hassle of finding an open outlet. When the school day is over, I can kick back on the couch and comfortably hold my iPad in my lap as I catch up on everything such as sports and news.\n\nI have found that the app store offers just about everything I want for my iPad. I have utilized several different genres of apps including games, news, sports and school. Unfortunately there are a few apps that aren't compatible with some of my homework assignments, so I have to use my laptop in these cases. Even though it isn't too big of an inconvenience, it would be nice if I could use my iPad for all of my school work. On the other hand, I have utilized several apps that are compatible with my school work such as good notes and quizlet. These apps have allowed me to make note cards with ease, as well as open my teachers slides and easily take notes on the app that I can look back on when Im studying.\n\nOn top of the several apps I have found to help enhance my school work, I have several other apps that take up a lot of space. The sixteen gigabits of space available has enabled me to follow my favorite sports teams and television addictions. I have multiple apps regarding sports such as a simple score app and others that offer live sporting games like watchESPN. I also have apps for Netflix, HBO, and almost every T.V. network that allows live streaming of shows and I have never come close to using my maximum space available.\n\nI absolutely love my iPad and have used it every day since I purchased it! I highly recommend the iPad for people of all ages; everyone can find something of interest on the iPad to enhance their day-to-day activities or simply for personal enjoyment. I have been able to use it for both and don't know what I would do without it!"}

The screen is so much larger for viewing whatever it is that you are looking at...whether reading the news on a website, watching a TV program or looking through your stored photos.\n\nGreat product at a great value.

But every possible indicator I could perceive convinces me I got a brand new, never opened factory new iPad.\nThe shipping was fast as usual, the price was fair, and most importantly the product was exactly as advertised."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00G2X1VIY", "review": "1 year after I purchased this and left a pretty good review...my iPad has completely stopped working and won't even turn on.  The retailer that sold it through amazon has been no help.  So I reached out to Apple to check the serial number.  They indicated that they had history of it being sold to an individual, and not the retailer that sold it to me through amazon.  I can connect the dots, and firmly believe (although I cannot specifically prove it at this point) that this was purchased from someone, REFURBISHED, and then mis represented and sold as NEW to me.  I have never bought a product directly from Apple that has crashed and malfunctioned within a year.  As a matter of fact none of my apple products purchased directly from apple have EVER had a single issue whatsoever before I decide to trade them in and upgrade.\nI've also seen other bad reviews for this retailer claiming that people have been sold refurbished electronics unknowingly.  You can probably connect the dots from here yourself as well.\nNot sure Amazon is vetting their third party retailers extensively enough, and as a result of this issue, I'll never be purchasing any high priced electronics through Amazon again.  Not worth the risk of misrepresentation."}

Everything works just as quick. The only thing my mother has is that she has that antireflective coating on it. That does make a little bit of a difference outside but other than that they're almost the same. Plus this has 64GB of memory when the iPad Air 2 of the same price only has like 16 GB. Lets just say, even if you use cloud space the apps will fill the iPad up. I have 18 GB in apps on my iPad."}

This iPad was the cheapest brand new iPad I could find (Apple sells the refurbished iPad Air at the same price as this brand new one). The iPad arrived in perfect condition - nothing was damaged (like other reviews state), and it doesn't appear to be used. The iPad also comes with Apple's limited 1 year warranty. My only complaint is that the screen on the iPad Air has a cheap, hollow, plastic-like feel, which after looking it up seems perfectly normal, but it'll still take time to get used to (the screen was purposely made thinner in order to make the iPad thinner/lighter). Other than that, it's a great, brand new iPad at a great price."}

I suggest you get the iPad Air. It brings fun to kids, teens, and adults everywhere around the world!\n\nDesign:\nThe iPad Air comes in many different colors. Its packaged in a high quality box that is much more appealing than regular cardboard. The iPad Air already comes with a home and lock screen background, but you can change it if you want. The iPad Air is like any iPhone, but it is much more convenient if you need to type, play games, or watch videos on a bigger screen. Some people might say the iPad Air is also like a regular iPad, but its not because the iPad Air is lighter and thinner than a regular iPad. I only have one criticism of the design of the iPad Airs box: the iPad Air might be too bulky and heavy if you travel with it in its original packaging. I recommend buying a thinner case.\n\nApps:\nThe iPad Air already comes with apps such as Calculator, FaceTime, Messages, Weather, etc. You have to download certain apps by yourself (such as games). If you're a student youll need to download apps like Microsoft Word to type. A problem with some of the apps is that they either glitch or lag. Sometimes they can mess up your iPad. Also, some of the apps can take up too much space and using the apps might make your iPad work slower.\n\nCamera:\nThe iPad Air comes with a camera to take pictures, videos, and selfies. The camera works very well with FaceTime. The camera on the iPhone is the same as the iPad Air, meaning that it takes better pictures and videos than a Samsung phone/tablet. One problem about taking pictures and videos is that if you take too many, you will run out of space on your iPad Air.\n\nColors:\nThe iPad Air comes in five different colors: red, black, white, silver, and space grey. These different colors are helpful when you're in a rush and you don't want to accidentally grab someone elses iPad. These different colors will most likely help those of you who have busy schedules. A problem with the colors is that people might want their iPad Air in blue, green, or pink. People who want different colors might become tired of the same five colors.\n\nConclusion:\nThe iPad Air is perfect for Apple product lovers, gamers, and students. Even though there might be some problems with the iPad Air (such as the apps lagging/glitching), its still a good product. You might have to pay extra depending on how many gigabytes you want for storage space. Dont forget that an iPad Air is light and thin so it won't be as heavy and as thick as a regular iPad. If you love Apple products, travel around as a student, or love playing games, the iPad Air is for you!"}

As for computers I believe they are the best in the world.  They are not only on the cutting edge, but are extremely reliable, user friendly, designed with perfection and I believe the IPad Air will be the same. I do a lot of photo editing and I am using an App on my IPad called \"Snapseed\" (free) from the App store.  It's an incredible App, great for photo editing,  I give this App a 5 star for function, ease of use and results.  Have had it for only a few weeks as this was written, but I have a lot of confidence in Apple products.  I'm sure I won't be disappointed.

It loads internet pages WAY slower than my iphone, WAY slower than my laptop, while using the same wi-fi connection. I bought the ipad primarily for internet surfing / reading.  The slow loading defeats that purpose, and I end up rarely using the ipad because of the slow loading.  I also find it irritating that 1.  there's no way to disable the popup for Game Center sign-in when opening a game app.  (I don't use Game Center and there's no way to disable the popup when opening a game app, or to just delete Game Center entirely, since it's part of the operating system.)  2. The email format doesn't allow an open email to be \"closed\"; the ipad just overlays an open email with the mailbox menu. 3.  My iphone comes with a handy weather app, the ipad does not have a weather app at all (and I don't like the ones I've found online for free).  The biggest issue though, by far, is that I'm VERY frustrated with the slow internet loading - for this reason it was almost a complete waste of money for me.  I can check email on it so it gets one star."}

Apparently this and her iPhone 5 have extreme difficulty in consistently picking up Verizon Fios' new router which has dual broadband outputs. The newest and best is 5g, which Verizon set us up with. To make it worse, Apple Tech was unaware that it is a simple matter of using the Fios remote to get network name and password, onscreen, instead of having to crawl around on the floor in the closet with a flashlight to laboriously write down the new router information. My wife will try to get it and her iPhone -- which has also stopped working because of new passwords etc. in the iPad setup -- working at the Apple Store; if she can't we'll try return this. I strongly recommend that you not try to use this generation iPad with a more modern router or network."}

It is legit and the real deal, new in box, never opened from apple. It's fast, it's light, and the display is awsome, and I restored everything from Apple's icloud without a flaw, which without a doubt proved it was an authentic Apple product or it would not have allowed me to restore my settings from icloud ! My wife loves it!!!!! It replaced her old ipad 2 which is much heavier and slower. Thanks Pocket-Gear and Amazon, you rock!!!! Do your home work, Some retailers are selling unknowing selling ipads that have been switched by thieves or in some cases unhonest employees, switching new ipads for fake or empty plastic shells, buyer beware. Take this into account when you see some of those reviews on a site, it happened at Best Buys and Wal-Mart!!!!!"}

It is in perfect condition and had extras. Very good price for 128G and a tempered glass screen cover. I was so happy and excited to get it before Christmas because I was able to give my Mom the iPad I already had for Christmas. She only plays games on it but she was always hijacking it and you just can't be taking stuff from my Mom. It would be like picking on a puppy. I am extremely happy with this purchase and I would definitely recommend this seller and buy from them again."}

So I ended up buying 2. I love how slim the iPad is, that being said, we do not use any cases for our iPads. All we have on them are the ArmorSuit screen protectors on them and they are fine. The iPads are also a lot more durable than I thought they would be. My husband forgets his on the couch sometimes and my dogs (which are both big boys) will step on it and play wrestle on top of the iPad and it is totally fine. The battery life seems to be pretty good as well. The only thing that would make me like this a little more is if it had a flash for the camera, that is a downfall."}

I mainly use it for email, web surfing, reading books/publications, calendar, weather, maps, and YouTube!  This tablet is really well designed and has a sturdy/solid build to it.  Really well made!  I have a wireless router in my house so I can connect to the internet easily with it.  This tablet is is easy to setup and is very simple to use!  The screen is very clear and vibrant with great color!  Interacting with the tablet with the touch sensitive screen works well and responds to your inputs efficiently.  The screen does become oily due to your fingers moving across it but all you have to do is wipe the screen down once in a while and it becomes crystal clear again.  The speaker system works surprising good for music and volume control seems to be fine.  I believe the Apple iPad is the best tablet on the market and I highly recommend you purchase one!  You will love it!"}

The iPad was purchased as a gift and was not activated until late October. The battery now needs to be replaced because it is not working properly. After scheduling an appointment with the Apple Store, I was told that the iPad was originally purchased in Canada and the warranty activated in June 2015. The Apple Store is making good on my warranty for now, but due to this issue I will lose three months of warranty on the product, which I believed to be brand-new. I had also install the screen protector on the iPad, which the Apple Store will not replace, so I lost money on that too."}

Originally purchased it intending and hoping for it to fully replace my broken macbook however quickly realized that this is not the answer.  The biggest frustration for me was browsing with tabs and if you flick tabs they reset so if you're filling out a form and flick to another to get some info - you will come back to your form and it will reset and you have to start over. That drove me absolutely crazy - not just with forms but even when scrolling Facebook feed it takes you back to the top so you have to stick with it till you're done or you lose your place.\nBattery life is great and still going well over a year later.\nHad no problems with it at all.  Use it a lot for the photo and video taking aspect as its convenient plus uploading the videos to email is so much quicker and sending is quicker than any other device I've tried.\nDefinitely not a replacement for a laptop though especially if you do tabbed browsing and use folders as folders just aren't even an option that I could find.  Plus you really need a stand for it if you're using it for any length of time too."}

I placed the order on Friday and received it on Tuesday (2 days before the estimated delivery range which happily was on my birthday!)  Upon opening the box, I noticed a small dent in the corner of the sealed Apple box.  I think this occurred during shipping and wasn't close to the actual item.  While the shipping box may have been a bit too short in height, I did like that the sealed Apple box was placed diagonally in it. This meant that the screen was facing one of the four long corners of the box, an area that is able to withstand a lot of pressure/weight, so the risk of damage to the major surfaces was significantly reduced.  I checked the IMEI with the Activation Lock tool, and my iPad was legit!  Low price, no tax, and $10 shipping - full price ($400) and tax ($32) = $113 savings, a great birthday present to myself, and a very satisfied customer!!!"}

The shipping was super fast, too.  I received it the day after it was ordered.\n\nThe user interface is simple, the WiFi connectivity is strong, and the Apps are great.  I upgraded to iOS 9.0.2 and it's even simpler to use than it was before.\n\nI highly recommend this to anyone as a first time tablet."}

So if your getting one of these make sure you are there that day to receive it. Also don't worry about what other people are saying about the screen being cracked, because the ups guys probably don't know what is in there so they just set it down a little hard. To resolve that other problem, if you are not home to receive it, then just put a note on your door that says \"Please be fragile and leave package out of site. When you read this message please take this note off. Thank you.\" or something so they know to leave it. I am even typing this review on my new iPad. It is a great product and handles well with IOS 9 it just takes a long time to update because it is large. Sorry I couldn't take a photo of the iPad but it is because I am using it and the charger."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00G2X1VIY", "review": "How deceptive can a seller be? Decptive enough to place refurbished ipads in new boxes that come \"looking\" like their factory sealed but sadly their not even new. First red flag for me was the serial number on the box that the ipad came in did not match the serial number that is displayed under Settings>General>About. This is where all the \"real\" information about the ipad is located folks. After noticing the serial number did not match i then noticed the model of the ipad was not correct either. The ipad model in the Amazon listing of this seller claims this model is MD789LL/A, in fact it is NOT under the About section located under the settings of the ipad my model number is FF529LL/B which is classified REFURBISHED, i was told this after contacting Apple. In addition the responsiveness of the touch screen is pretty disappointing on this ipad as well; maybe that has something to do with the fact that its refurbished crap. This being my third ipad and all I'm kind of familiar with the quality of Apple products. If you plan on purchasing from this seller i would proceed with extreme caution and check the serial number as well as the model number not the ones located on the box but the \"real\" information stored inside the ipad (Settings>General>About is where you can find that information). Then verify the model number and serial number by contacting Apple to see if you have a \"new\" ipad as this seller is FALSELY ADVERTISING! I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS SELLER TO ANYONE!!!"}

They weren't... all four of them crapped out quickly and just couldn't perform as expected because they aren't built with high quality or 'fast' components...

I feel like if you are going to spend an extra $80 to $100, you should also get more with the product. Maybe it would be a little slimmer, maybe it would be a little faster. I just have issue with the large cost increase for just extra storage. With that said, I'm happy with the product that I have, but do wish that I had gotten the larger size. I say that I wish that I had gotten the larger size, but would not have actually purchased the larger size.\n\nFor ~$350, you're getting a great device that will allow you do a multitude of things. This device fits great in your hand and looks amazing, no matter what you are doing. The screen is absolutely phenomenal and it is a really great device. I found that my children actually used this more than I did, but that everyone in the family had some sort of fun on it. Whether it be streaming a movie or show (kids), shopping (my wife), or just enjoying all that the device has to offer (me), there is something for everyone to enjoy with an iPad.\n\nI know that I'm late to review it, but if you are looking for an iPad right now and are contemplating one of the newer versions versus this one, I would say that it all depends on what you want out of it. If you need the newest and greatest, obviously get the iPad Air 2 (or whatever version is available at the time of reading this review). If you are happy with a device that may not be as fast as the newest one and you are on a budget, this is a great option for you.\n\nEven after the honeymoon phase of owning a new device, I still found myself reaching for it over my phone or my computer when I needed to look something up or just wanted to relax for a bit."}

Since those were the two main reasons I purchased this little iPad, I am now returning it to Sprint on their buy-back plan and am just going to eat what it cost me up to this point. I gave it a year and I was never happy with it. If you get one, get the most ram you can because not only are the views incredibly small of anything on an internet browse, but you can paint and dry your nails while you wait for a page to load. I am going to replace this with a small laptop with super ram in one of the switchable styles where it can function as as pad or a laptop (under $300 these days). They are almost the same size though just a tad heavier. I'm willing to add a pound of weight to get the functions and I need and an acceptable speed of operation."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00G2X1VIY", "review": "This iPad Air has serious issues with Internet crashing up to several times on a page. Sometimes the page don't reload. Video quality is awful...blurry with audio out of sync with the video. Additionally, when I touch the screen to go to a page or to comment...more often than not I am directed to the page above or below my selection. I contacted Apple Support five times since I purchased my iPad Air late last August about these issues. Last week I was finally allowed to send my iPad in for repair. On the day Apple received my iPad Air they sent a replacement that I thought was identical to the one I purchased last August. It was not the same model and a couple of Apps are not supported by the model I was sent. One of those apps I used daily.\nWhen I complained about the crashing every support person seemed surprised. But after reviewing reviews about my iPad Air...Apple knew about the issue of crashing in January 2014...although the tech support seemed surprised of this issue when I started contacting them in late September 2014.\nApple is an extremely profitable company and now I know why...because their products are sub-standard. The company has over $200 billion dollars assets that are overseas. They do not fix issues with their products...they just dupe us with promises of better quality and don't deliver on those promises."}

I ordered the air with otterbox case so that it wouldn't be too heavy for my 90 year old grandmother. She can lift it. It does have one problem: it randomly turns off the wi-fi and sometimes turns on airplane mode. I have no idea how it happens. At first I thought it was my grandma not knowing what she was doing, but it continued to have this problem when my grandma was in the hospital and left the iPad at home with me. Other than that, it's a good ipad."}

You have to sign for it and that is the only way I would want it to be considering the price. The colors of the retina display are amazing. It is feather light and slick to handle. I put a Supcase on it very soon after I bought it. I have not had an iPad before, but the battery life seems to be very good on it. I was going to get the iPad 2 or 4, but for not a whole lot more money I got lots of upgraded hardware and the second newest version.

Being that the mother board for an apple 128gb IPAD air isn't even $200 this was a much better route and considering she was very pleased with the condition and functionality of the unit she received that proved this was a good decision. Great purchase, happy wife, happy me."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00G2X1VIY", "review": "Love my new ipad!!  I've always been an Android guy but have always been curious on the ipads. I have an expensive Android tablet,  but decided to see what the big fuss is all about. So,  I decided order me an ipad and came across the ipadvair and decided to order. SO glad I did!!  Love my new Apple. Its so then and light and love the screen on this tablet. My android tablet has a full HD screen but I honestly can't tell the difference. Apples software just seems to flow and run so smoother than my Android,  I can definitely see why so many people have Apple ipads!! The speakers on it are just as loud and sound just as good other tablet with Dolby sound built in. I actually haven't used my other Android tablet since I got my new Apple!  I highly recommend anyone to try an Apple,  and you to will love yours!!\n\n****UPDATE*** 08/09/15********\nBeware, I thought I was purchasing a BRAND NEW unit and come to find out I was sold a refurbished or previously activated unit. My charger quit working after only 4 months, contacted Apple Tech Support for warranty exchange, and only to come to find out my warranty had already expired!!! WHAT???? Yup, the unit was previously activated and or refurbished at least a year prior to me getting it which means my BRAND new unit that I thought was new had no warranty at all and I would have to pay an additional $20 for a new charger at a Apple Store. Luckily, Amazon stepped up and is letting me return the unit for a full refund. THANK  YOU Amazon, you guys are great!! But, please beware as you can see from other people on here that are getting used units from these sellers."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00G2X1VIY", "review": "If you like tablets, you might consider the iPad Air. It has a 9.7 inch display, an A7 processor, and an M7 coprocessor. It comes with iOS 7. Then for my favorite part of the iPad Air, which is that you can use it as a personal hotspot for your other devices. For example, let's say your on vacation in a hotel in Washington D.C., but it doesn't it have Wi-Fi. No problem! Just set up the iPad hotdog on your phone and voila! The iPad Air is much thinner than its predecessors, with a 7.5 millimeter edge. It has a 5 Megapixel camera, which is the same as the other iPads. The only thing that I can criticize about the Air is that it lacks Slo-Mo video AND filters, and even the 5c has those, and the 5c is hardly as powerful as the tablet. I hope you enjoyed, and I also hope that Apple goes on to make more powerful tablets."}
