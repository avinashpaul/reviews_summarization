{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B01865QFJA", "review": "Won't replace my iPad but definitely worth the price. I bought this tablet for my children. When I first got it and tried to connect it to my Wifi I had a bunch of issues. I think the signal strength of this tablet isn't the best. Once I got the range figured out I just made sure to stay in said area to download or play games that require wifi. I want to note I even have a wifi range extender so the issue shouldn't be on my end. Minor issue so moving on. It comes with a screen protector on it so that's is a great plus! No worrying about applying it or finding one to purchase. I'd gave to say that I don't feel the button layout is very user friendly. I find it to be akward and not very well planned out. Overall this is a good tablet for the price. In the box it comes with different outlet adapters for travelers or those who live abroad. I feel at a price point of $100.00 it is worth it but not over $100.00. I recurred thus product at a discount in exchange for an honest unbiased review."}

I was really happy to be offered this 10.1\" Fusion5 104 GPS Android Tablet PC at discount in exchange for honest and unbiased review.\n\nFirst of all, it is a well-rated product in UK (my guess they launched it in UK first) -&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/10-1-34-Fusion5-104-GPS-Android-Tablet-PC-32GB-Storage-Android-5-1-Lollipop-Bluetooth-4-0-FM-1280-800-IPS-Screen-5000mAh-battery-2MP-front-and-rear-camera-Supports-OTA-Updates/dp/B01CCYEIW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">10.1\" Fusion5 104 GPS Android Tablet PC - 32GB Storage - Android 5.1 Lollipop - Bluetooth 4.0 - FM - 1280*800 IPS Screen - 5000mAh battery - 2MP front and rear camera - Supports OTA Updates</a>. So it wasn't as scary to purchase it. :)\n\nPROs:\n- PRICE. When I purchased it it showes $149.99 (really nice) and now it shows $99.99, which is even better! I mean over 10\" tablet for under $100? What's there to think about? Comes with 1 year warranty!\n- SIZE. 10.1\" elongated (kind of like widescreen)\n- STORAGE. 32GB. Definitely awesome! Many tablets come with 8 or 16 GB. I really feel that nowadays with all the applications/games, 32GB must be a minimum. I have few other tablets at 8GB and 16GB - the memory ran out pretty fast. And on top of 32GB in this tablet, you can get memory card to store even more!\n- PORTS.  Micro SD Card slot (up to 64GB). Also has mini HDMi output (you can connect to TV!).\n- CAMERA. Dual camera (front and back). Both 2.0MP.\n- SPEAKERS. Dual speakers (you get a good stereo sound)\n- ACCESSORIES. Nice feature that it has power supply with interchangeable outlets for few countries (Europe, US, Australia)\n- PACKAGING. Very appealing box it's coming in, which is also important, if you are giving this as a gift.\n\nCONs:\n- CASE - I wish more cases were available or maybe generic cases would fit. When I emailed to the seller, he suggested me this one -&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/10-1-34-Fusion5-Folio-PU-Leather-Case-Smart-Fit-Cover-For-Fusion5-104-GPS-Tablet-Only/dp/B01CD62O2K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">10.1\" Fusion5 Folio PU Leather Case Smart Fit Cover For Fusion5 104 GPS Tablet Only</a>.

Some of you will want a pretty case, other than plain black.. lol :)\n- SCREEN PROTECTOR. Already pre-installed. Yes it's nice thinking, but it does bubble up.\n- ACCESSORIES. Put a mini HDMi cable. The tablet has a port, so it's nice to add this cable.\n\nI think it's about time a nice large table cost under $100.. Lol..\n\nI will post updates on its longevity...\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUPDATE: MAY 2016. The screen got broken. Not sure how - started at the angle. But that's not the problem. The problem is we have installed many Digitizers ourselves for iPads and Androids, so I was hoping I can get a Digitizer and simply change myself.\n\nHere is the response I got from seller: \"Hi. Thank you for your email. We are sorry to hear of your misfortune\nUnfortunately as warranties do not cover accidental damages, it would incur you a cost of $59.00 for replacement screen repair. (This quote includes labour, parts and return postage from our repair centre)\nIf you are unsure about it, we suggest you to take a third party independent advice. \"\n\nSo, there are no Digitizers for this device and I need to pay over $60 (s/h as well), so they can repair the device?? Stick to the famous brand names, with less hassle."}

This tablet is pretty fast, has a bright screen, good color quality, and one of the best features is it can accept up to 128 gigs sd mini card. It's everything the item description says it is, and then some. If you get a mini card for it, you'll want to get at least a Class 10 HD, which I plan to do in the very near future. Its manual states that it will accept up to a 32 gig external card, but in the description that Amazon puts out, it says that it will accept 128 gig card. I talked with Amazon about the confusion. After Amazon checked, it was confirmed that the HD Model will accept the 128 gig mini card. I don't know about the lower-end models, but the HD model will take the 128 gig card. This is a very impressive tablet, especially for the price, and I am quite pleased with it. Battery life of 5 to 6 hours is a little disappointing, but I can live with that. After all, it is an HD Model. The cameras are kind of low-end, but I can live with that too. Overall, this is an exceptional tablet for the price!"}

I can watch Netflix and Amazon Prime (prime app wouldn't work on my ASUS) and even show them on my flat screen or projector using the mini-HDMI port (the cable from my ASUS even worked with this one, bonus!)  The screen is beautiful and clear, and the tablet is very responsive.  I can't find anything I don't like about my new Fusion5, 10 inch, Android 7 Nougat tablet.

It is a perfectly fine tablet for the price. $99 will not get you super high quality anything in the electronics world\n\nIt is not fast, but it will play most apps at a reasonable speed. Graphics and sound are adequate and with a little tweaking it is serviceable for most duties. Just keep in mind it is only $99 so it won't blow you away in any way.\n\nIt loses a star in rating because it is difficult to find a cover for it and screen protectors don't stay on properly. But then again, I don't feel the need to super protect a $99 tablet.\n\nScreen has held up for me after minor wear and tear. It is a little awkward dimension wise but not a big issue.\n\nSo if you need a cheap tablet to do a bit of surfing, play a couple mid-level Apps, and do minor functions this tablet does its job."}

I must say this has not been my experience at all. I had a Samsung 2014 10.1 version before that was an excellent tablet for many years...switching to this one has been a nightmare! It works just fine, if you don't mind a pace slower than a snail! I could literally tap on something I wanted to highlight, walk away and come back to STILL be waiting for the items highlighters to come up within a text. Also, opening any app and navigating within it is SO SLOW it's unbelievable that this tablet got any good reviews. Save yourself the trouble and frustration and choose another tablet.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B01865QFJA", "review": "It just arrived today. It came in a very nice-looking, sturdy box, with a charger and charging cable.\nI like the fact that it uses a standard USB connection, so I can buy replacement cables anywhere. The last low-cost tablet I got had a weird plug, and I was always loosing the charging cord.\nNow when my niece (the tablet is for a kid) needs to charge it up, she can use any of the half-dozen or so chargers strategically located around the house.\n\nIt came with a manual, but the text was small and light and unreadable. But you don't need it -- turn on the tablet, sign in to your Google account, and just go through their prompts. No problems at all, and I got it set up the same way I had it on her old tablet.\n\nThe manufacturer did include a note that said I would get a gift for writing this review (a fidget spinner, a power bank, or a micro sD card) so take this review with a grain of salt.\n\nI use a Samsung tablet as my main tablet, and this one feels a little bit slower. But that could also be that I'm in the process of re-installing all the odl apps. (You go to the Play Store, pull up \"my apps\" and just select all the ones you want to reinstall.) And there were a couple of times when Google Play stopped responding and I had to start over, but that could have been because I was juggling several accounts -- mine, my sister's, my niece's, and a restricted profile for my niece, since she's very young.\n\nBut I can definitely see using this if my own tablet isn't available.\n\nThe biggest problem I had with this tablet is that I had trouble finding a screen protector and case to fit. It was slightly shorter but wider than the previous tablet she had.\n\nI ordered the Fusion5 104A GPS Case, and it didn't close tightly.\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01KI3AWMO/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1\n\nThe case was too wide and too short (or vice versa -- the case was a thinner rectangle and the tablet was more square-ish). I'm going to have to order another case. I'm having trouble finding one.\n\nAnd I ordered the Dmax Armor [3-Pack] for Insignia Flex 10.1 inch and had to cut it to fit -- it was too long.\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01B6SLAOE/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1\n\nUPDATE TWO HOURS LATER: It's done installing all of my niece's old apps and updating software, so I went in and starting customizing the desktop, logging into all the apps, all that usual stuff. And there have been a LOT of error messages that one app or another failed to load and had to close -- mostly Google Play but others as well. And it's still pretty laggy, even though all the updates and installs are done. I wouldn't recommend buying this as a primary tablet for adults to use to work on. I use a Samsung tablet for that, and it's much nicer and more responsive."}

I got the tablet and it was only partially wiped!!!! I downloaded my fav game, opened it, and instead of a login screen I am auto login to another person's account. That person's Google Play Account is still saved to the device I received. It's a good thing I have integrity. If nothing else. I could have stayed logged in to their account in the game, but some very expensive items that can be gifted to other players(I'm talking over $100 a gift). Not only did I not recieve a new item, the person who had it before could have been cost a LOT of money."}

It comes with 2 screen protectors- one is a screen protector that has info about the tablet printed on it, There is however another clear thin film one that comes preinstalled underneath the thicker printed one.

The most novel aspect is the FM radio. Although you need to\n\nput in headphones to use the FM (for the antenae), wi-fi does not need to be on. I tested that to confirm that it wasn't pulling internet radio. It finds local FM stations quickly and keeps them tuned in strongly.\n\nThe screen is nice and bright and videos look very good. The resolution at 800x1280 is fine for most uses (itnernet videos, some games, etc).  The speed is very nice too. Pages refresh well. The GPS (Maps app) uses wi-fi to find its way around. I was hoping to get a real satellite-based GPS instead of wi-fi, but it still works well when within wi-fi range.\n\nThe tablet is nice and light and easy to carry around. All around, a nice tablet for most purposes on the Net. I would purchase again."}

The battery life is horrible. Do not leave this device off of the charger overnight.

It doesn't Use all the cores they go to Sleep and stay asleep.\n\nBeing there's only 1gb ram and 30%is used by Android... Loading 1 app will load to 100% capacity that's where the other cores are supposed kick in be split over the other  cores to offset the load.\n\nSo many people were  correct it will bog down after loading  1 app.\nNow there is 4cores,if you Reboot a few times it will will work with the 4 cores, but if you see it working with 1 core reboot it.\n\nThis is a hardware fault, and cannot be fixed via software.\n\nNO One should have to reboot the tablet a few times Hoping the 4 cores LOAD\n\nIt does take a while to charge, I'm used to USB-C fast charge, you're getting Micro USB 2.0 (again $99).\n\nThere is NO COVER for this item.\n\nThe one that Amazon \"says to BUY together\" doesn't FIT!\n\nIt's made for the 10.6 inch tablet of the same name, not the 10.1 inch, please be careful.\n\nI called Amazon, spent a few hours hopefully you guys won't see that combo offered they said should be fixed within 24 hours.\n\nI  contacted the Vendor, they said they  don't know why Amazon is telling people to buy that cover since it doesn't fit...\n\nThe replied back with a model # saying this will work, guess what.. It brings you to the tablet page with NO Offering for a cover.\n\nThey also said they will be getting covers in stock soon.\n\nAt least you get (2) speakers One about an inch away from each end of the bottom  of the tablet,rather than a Cheap One speaker.\n\nI got this because it has HDMI OUT!  It's a good feature to have, sadly with one core working you won't be displaying much of any video without severe stuttering.\n\nAmazon has already setup a return and pickup, I suggest you do the same if your all four cores don't load up  at once (download a bench marking tool it will show you)."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01865QFJA", "review": "Unit arrived within 2 days with free shipping. Simply amazing Amazon! Unit booted right up and was very similar to MS OS10 so it wasn't real hard to get started. Instruction manual is worthless. Most tips and info I got from Google or You Tube. Plenty of storage as it comes with 32g and you can add another 128g. I put a 32g SD card in so I have 64g total. We'll see how that works. I can always put in a larger SD later. Unit is fast and no glitches. It is  a bargain and only about 1/3 what a name brand unit costs. It also has a 1 year warranty while name brands have only 90 days and you don't get all the same features with them. Let's face it they all come from China so why pay more than you have to? Great bargain. Recommend to everyone."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B01865QFJA", "review": "This tablet had some pretty solid reviews, and at this price point, it looked like a steal. I bought two of them, because as inexpensive as they were, why not?\n\nUnfortunately, they're CRAP. They're awful. Performance is sluggish, the display looks terrible, and the speakers make an annoying clicking sound that I'm pretty sure they're not supposed to make. And I don't think I just got a defective unit, because they both behave exactly the same way.\n\nI bought them to replace a tablet that's a few years old and getting a bit long in the tooth, but my old tablet is so much better in every possible way -- faster performance, a vibrant, high-resolution display, and much sturdier-feeling construction -- that it's not going to be retired quite yet. The Fusion5 is just straight-up garbage in comparison.\n\nI have no idea where all these five-star reviews are coming from, because this is an objectively terrible tablet. I don't regret giving it a shot -- you win some and you lose some when you hunt for bargains, and I lost this one. If my review spares anyone else from making the same mistake, I'll consider the whole experience worthwhile."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B01865QFJA", "review": "This is for the 16 GB, December 2017 version of the Fusion5.\n\nI'll start with the pros before delving into my gripes. It's cheap, there's no denying that and for the price point, it's running a fairly recent version of Android (7.0 Nougat), doesn't have bloatware, is reasonably fast and for its size, feels pretty light. I also have no complaints on the battery life so far. That's all the nice things I have to say about it.\n\nLet's start with the screen. I'm not sure if the manufacturer changed something since the reviews touting a 'crisp', 'clear' or 'amazing' display but mine is totally underwhelming to say the least. I was quite surprised and excited, unboxing the Fusion5, to see that it was an anti-glare screen (something I haven't seen mentioned in any of the reviews I've read). My excitement fizzled quickly however once the screen started showing scratches as soon as I cleaned it with a lint free cloth. I'll be honest, I knew what I was getting into with a 1280x800 resolution but be aware that with a screen that size and the resolution, you can clearly see every pixel on screen and it's often distracting, although to be fair, not so much when gaming. One last issue that has been mentioned in other reviews: it is not a bright display. In fact it's quite dim when comparing it to other tablets the same size.\n\nRegarding the form factor, the plastic back shell feels like it could easily break. This is how it feels, I didn't either break it or attempt to break it. It just feels flimsy. Several reviews have mentioned the odd placement of the power and volume buttons and although I did get use to the buttons being placed on the top left side of the screen instead of top right, when holding the tablet in portrait mode, this inverts the up and down on the volume and I keep lowering the volume when I mean to raise it. This design decision is senseless and annoying.\n\nI've had some problems with Bluetooth initially. It might have been an issue specific to my particular unit but I didn't seem to be able to connect Bluetooth devices that had already been paired with the tablet. It looks like it went away for now.\n\nOne final random piece of information. I purchased this tablet to run game emulators and although it will run DraStic (Nintendo DS), Mupen64 (N64), Snes9x, GemBoy!, Reicast, MAME4droid, ePSXe and PPSSPP just fine, be warned that Dolphin (GameCube & Wii) is unusable.\n\nI'm still debating returning it."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B01865QFJA", "review": "This is a decent tablet for the price especially for the screen size (Which, by the way, already comes with a screen protector on it.) but the wifi leaves much to be desired. It is very slow, looses connection and sometimes won't even turn on. When the wifi is on; it slows the tablet down so I only have it on if I am downloading or updating apps. Other than that 1 issue I am very pleased with my purchase. I would have given it 5 stars if It had better wifi performance."}

If I can keep one person from buying a Fusion5 product it was worth the few minutes it took to write this review.\n\nI thought to myself, surely there must be an affordable quality alternative to an Ipad. After much research I made a terrible decision purchased this tablet.\n\nThe screen resolution is good. Battery life was horrible, 2 hours at best. The speakers might as well not be there. With the volume turned the entire way up it made the slightest muffled noises. All of this I justified to my wife as, at least we saved money not buying an iPad.\n\nThen after less than a month of the tablet sitting on our end table (used only as a baby monitor screen) I noticed a crack in the screen corner. The crack came from the power cord insert. When I touched to see if it was the screen protector the screen cracked the entire way across. Now the screen does not work at all. THIS TABLET WAS NOT DROPPED OR MISHANDLED, it just broke.\n\nI contacted fusion and they discribed it as wear and tear. Completely absurd that this company considers this an acceptable failure after three weeks. Paid my money and had a poor quality tablet for three weeks. Now I am left with nothing because the company doesnt stand behind their product.\n\nDO NOT BUY! keep your money or buy something else!\n\nThe tablet and the company who makes it are worthless. They will take your money and not deliver on the product discription that you read above. Dont get robbed like me."}

I have a limited budget, so I was looking for a tablet that was affordable to replace my currently tablet that is about 4 years old.\n\nPhysically the table is beautiful.  I love the slim profile and the perfect weight of the device.  However, using the tablet, no so much.  The version I purchased had only 1 GB of RAM.  Using the tablet was very cumbersome.  Apps took a long time to open (30-90 seconds), and at times crashed before they could open.  Tablet had difficulty staying connected to the internet even though I have a stable connection (my other devices  my Roku box, my blu-ray player, my phone and my computer had no such issues).  And the tablet itself would lock up and I would have to reboot it to get it going again.\n\nI really wanted to like this device, but that did not happen.  I will be returning the device to Amazon."}

Tablet is fast and hasn't let me down yet.  Screen resolution crisp and clear.  It has front speakers, which I like better as the sound will not be muffled when you buy a case.  Speaking of case, the Fusion5 online support helped me find one since I had a trouble locating the correct one. The only thing I miss is the vibrating noise when you shut it off.  It has happened several times with another tablet that I assumed I had shut down only to find the next day that the battery was depleted, therefore I always pay attention to that particular sound.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B01865QFJA", "review": "First, let me start off by saying this is not my first tablet, but this will be my last if this is the state of the tablet industry.\n\nFrom the very moment that I opened the package from Amazon I knew I was going to be disappointed, and shouldn't have even bothered giving this product a chance. For starters, the tamper tape/stickers were peeled off when I first got the package, and the sticky residue was all dried up from the tape/sticker indicating that this had been peeled off long ago. Second, upon opening the box I found that my \"new\" tablet had finger prints all over the screen, as well as a screen protector had been improperly placed on it (air pockets, dust, and what appeared to be a bit of potato chip). There were also some minor scuffs and scratches in the plastic backing, now I don't mind the casing being plastic as that helps to keep price and weight down, but I do mind my \"new\" product having very obvious damage to the back.\n\nNow, let's move to how the device performs. Slow. Simple as that, this device is so slow. It advertises 2 GP RAM and a 1.8 GHz Processor which should be able to handle almost all mobile games, so I decided to test the limits of this device with two or three different games, all of which minimum spec requirements (and even recommended) were below the specs of this device and all of the games I was averaging 11 FPS or lower, which is absolutely unacceptable to a device advertised as a gaming device. I guess I was asking for it by trying to test the hardware, but I think that a device claiming to be good for gaming should be able to at least hit 30, or even 20 Frames for a game that is far below the requirements of this device. Now, after I realized this device would be no good for gaming, I at least tried to see it's multimedia and video streaming services. Wow, was I disappointed, again, bad frame rates, and bad connection to my wireless network. After running speed tests I was averaging about 400 ms ping more on this device than any other device in my house.\n\nAll in all, do not be fooled by this product. You will probably get a used product, and your device will not perform nearly as well as it should based off the advertised spec's and hardware. Please, don't be like me and be fooled by this product."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01865QFJA", "review": "EDIT of my EDIT: Changed the rating to five stars. After a few hours with it, and testing a few more apps out, they all handle perfectly. My unity game just has poor optimization and that's my fault. The device is a steal at the 100 dollar price point, the screen is amazing and the speakers don't suck like in other budget tabs I've bought.\n\nEDIT: to the device's credit, I tried playing Minecraft and the experience was not terrible by any means. In fact once I played around with some settings it runs quite smoothly. Minecraft can run on a raspberry pi also so, take that how you want.\n\nMy initial impressions of this device are good. It looks and feels like a premium product. Android 7.0 is still pretty recent (my phone is running 8.0) and as long as your expectations are realistic this is a good device! Let me be clear. This will do multimedia stuff awesomely (music, photos, videos). It suffers at playing video games because it only has 1 gb of RAM.\n\nThis 1 gb of RAM also means that once you are done with an app you should close it right away. It's really good at doing a task not really good at doing multiple tasks.\n\nOverall I'm happy with this product though, it does not service me in the way I hoped it would (testing 2d unity games out, I'm a dev.)"}

My son uses these for gaming and they are solid performing machines. I have never seen a hickup during my sons gaming and performance is identical to my galaxy tab s3. Impressive.  As for the drops. Im not kidding these are fragile. I have a closet with 2 or 3 that would be fine if not for broken screens. The first drop was on my bed. We couldn't believe it.  The second time it flipped forward on its stand while charging.  Done. The third was my 55 lb son half rolled on it while watching t.v..now granted these are my mistakes and we take full responsibility.  However all the cheapest samsungs and lower end brands have endured much worse. In facr they have only been replaced due to performance and gaming capability.  In theory the fusion should be more robust. Its plastic which should absorb a hit better and lighter than big brands. What gives? The problem i think is this. I noticed when the fusion is flat waves in the glass usually near the edge seems. This can be noticed in all of mine i believe.  It was very frustrating to have to replace my sons few month old tablet 2 weeks before Christmas.  For the 3rd time. Im just bummed now because i thought i was golden when i found this brand now im on the fence about replacing again and out the full price of 3 tablets."}

What be is that? I uploaded screenshot from the listing where it clearly says 128.... What else is false or misleading about this tablet? I am a bit concerned now. Camera deff sucks but I knew that going in, I had hoped it wouldn't been as bad as others mentioned but it is out of focus/fuzzy with no way to improve quality of shot that I've found yet...

It works quickly and has space and plenty of cool capabilities, like turning sd cards or usb drives into internal storage. It has a beautiful screen, and I would recommend getting something to help protect it because it does scratch pretty easily. It has multiple ways through which it can charge(made it easier when I forgot my charger at school). It is overall quite functional. The reason I cannot give it five stars is that mine recently went into a bootloop for no reason. I had not downloaded anything I haven't had before. This happened less than 2 months after I got it. The customer service is responsive and is working with me to get it fixed, which is awesome. But even the day I opened it, it occasionally froze or got stuck on the boot screen. Not always, just sometimes. It also requires an sd card in order to download most files from the internet, like from email or a pdf or something. I have found that pretty bothersome. Overall, I would say it is a good tablet, very useful, has some issues, but I do like it."}

It hasn't crashed or hung at all yet while using the same applications I had in the old tablet, which was hanging frequently.\n\nThe only thing that prevents me from giving the 5th star is that so far the battery doesn't seem to last very long. But I still need to test it more and optimize battery usage by blocking a lot of unused applications form constantly draining battery in the background.\n\nFor the price I recommend this tablet."}

We download our shows onto the tablet and my wife will watch in the car for several hours with very little battery usage.  My one main complaint and this is MAJOR:  The volume level is VERY INADEQUATE.  If there is any background noise you will not be able to hear the audio without ear buds.  And not all ear buds seem to work.  My wife has a cheap plug-type pair that work OK but my high dollar Bose ones I cannot hear a thing.  Tried watching a movie on a plane and could not hear any dialog at all."}

I have purchased, and used many tablets, from relatively inexpensive no frills, to the big name - and big price ones. Okay, on to observations....\n\nAs others have said, the speakers sound tinny and have poor volume. Could be overcome with speakers or headphones.\nBattery life will not be the best with large bright screen.\nDoes get quite warm on back left.\nOnly 16GB storage, but being Android 6, a micro SD card can be formatted as \"internal\" and be used for app storage.\nFound it would not recognize bluetooth android controller - which works fine with my other tablets running 6.0\nBut the real deal killer for me is that the screen seems to be plastic. When cleaning fingerprints, it looked like this was causing the tiny fine swirls indicative of plastic.\n\nNow to the pros....\nBeing full HD 1980 X 1080, the screen is sharp and clear.\nAlso, screen has great angles of view - doesn't fade out it tilted up / down, or left / right.\n2GB ram, so there is plenty for apps\nOcta-core...This tablet is fast.\nNo bloatware.\nAndroid 6\n10.6\" - slightly wider screen than 10.1 - better for widescreen movies\n\nI find that  the seems to be screen plastic, and should have been listed. This is a deal breaker for me. I will return"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01865QFJA", "review": "Starts fast, great colors, and easy viewing. Charges with regular circular cord, so both myself and my kids (10 and under.) cannot connect it wrong - which, by the way, has killed many previous tablets. Large bright screen, has yet to crash, no bothersome bloatware, and has a protective case to match. Has micro-usb and regular usb, so can handle whatever is plugged in. I bought 3, although 1 for a spare - have kids - but despite a 600+ mile vacation trek before the start of school, tablets active all the way, no problems observed. One was dropped from about 38\" while in its matching case with no damage or other issue. The third one still sits unopened in its package should any fail, I didn't want crying kids saying \"why daddy!!!\" Luckily, these tablets worked flawlessly, but to anyone reading, if you are on a long road trip with no WiFi or internet access, make sure that before you pull out of your driveway,set the tablets for airplane mode, and also Battery Saver. Both cell phones and tablets will exhaust their batteries trying to connect to a network that they are unable to locate while in motion. For the tablet, good dual cameras, quite clear, good resolution and recorded sound. With the protective case, output sound is a bit diminished, but a $3 headset or equally cheap set of earbuds easily compensates for the added protection. Use these with caution, as this tablet can be quite loud, but awesome with the right music. As for the seller, all arrived as expected, on time, and in a condition expected of a new device. I also appreciated the protective packaging - not tough to open, but total and solidly, safely compacted. The care taken to ensure safe arrival was obvious. Setup of the tablet was a breeze, yet boring for any IT guy, but well appreciated for its ease of use. As the owner - and purchaser of many android tablets, I have zero complaints with this one, albeit I wish I had more time to use it."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01865QFJA", "review": "Superior resolution, better version of Android, more ram, faster CPU. Better overall product.\n\nThis is the first ANDROID based anything I've used that I can truly say holds up to competing systems like Windows or IOS.  The power drain usage on this thing is amazingly slow, charging is very fast.  The 2GB shows off what ANDROID (and Linux) can do with more RAM. The truly HD screen automatically sizes playback to a matching frame ratio to the video at best HD possible without any pixelation or artifacts in most instances.  I say \"most\" only because modern ANDROID is better at playing HD and more modern mastered Video streams, than ancient videos on retro source websites. Those play well, but do occasionally desynchronize due to the much older video technology used.  However, once you play back said videos and listen to sound, you notice rare if any pausing even when GMAIL is running or FACEBOOK is posting notifications enmasse. The system does a lot better than any other ANDROID I've seen at seamless multitasking the GUI and the Multimedia.  I've had a number of prior ANDROID products and was sorry I bought them, not to mention they wore out just outside the Warranty period.  This 10.6\" Fusion5 Tablet is way better built, has extensive connectivity between its connectors and its wireless, and its keyboard works much better.  The entire tablet is FAR MORE RESPONSIVE than anything I've used previously, including a Windows Phone.  In Marshmallow (Android 6.1) Google has created a riper more mature system.  I do still wish for more control of the underlying system, but that's just because I'm a techie and I would prefer not to have to use development tools or rooting just to have access to a command shell.\n\nHowever, I'd raise this Tablet's rating to 6 Stars if I could.  Nice work, Fusion 5, and \"AT LAST!\" to Google - keep on keeping on.\n\nBTW, the power connector is rigidly reinforced against breakage unlike other products I've used, and the unusually long battery life insures I can run it for my entire use for at least a day, without having to recharge it.  I'm planning on acquiring a Carry Case for it and taking it on the road with me.  I do hope they produce one with a built in phone/CellModem in the future!  Nonetheless, it is an EXCEPTIONAL VALUE and an EXCEPTIONAL PRODUCT."}

Sometimes it just won't turn on. We'll try pushing the power button fast, slow, hold it for a while, and nothing happens. Finally, after a combination of button pushing and connecting and disconnecting the charger, it will magically turn on. This has happened several times. It will also randomly no longer recognize the data on a micro sd card or that it even has an sd card inserted. I will take it out and put it back in, but it won't recognize it. If I put the card in another device, the data is recognized, so I know it isn't the cards that are corrupt. Nonetheless, I'll have to format the sd card and re-install everything for the tablet to see it. Finally, it will occasionally not recognize that its battery needs to be charged. It will be low (anything less than 100%) and we'll go to charge it, only for it to say that it is 100% charged already when we plug it in. Since it thinks it is already charged, it won't charge it anymore, meaning we are left with little run-time before the battery goes dead. This happens a lot recently. It's too bad because I really liked this tablet at first, but it hasn't even made it a year of occasional use before going bad."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B01865QFJA", "review": "Kind of hard to nail down a completely fair review. Let me explain. I own a Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 8\" which is my go to tablet. It is lightning quick, crystal clear and just an awesome tablet. It's responsiveness and build quality explain why it costs as much as it does. If I compare that tablet to this one, then I would give this one 1 star. However, when taking the price into consideration and what I wanted it for, I have to give it a few more stars. I wanted a larger (cheap) tablet that I could use and leave at work when things are slow to watch movies, play an occasional game and surf the web. So I went on a search to find a tablet that would fit those needs and not cost a lot.\nI read the reviews for this tablet and considering the specs vs price I thought I may have found a diamond in the rough. Well, don't expect a Cadillac when all you pay for is a Pinto.\n\nWhen I received the tablet and opened the box I immediately noticed why a tablet with such specs would be priced so low. It's all in the build. It is very cheaply made. The screen has these black lines that run across it and are really noticeable when the tablet is off. The corners of the screen were not completely glued or pressed down. At the edges of the tablet the screen looks wavy. I have what looks like a trapped air bubble under the screen in one spot. The screen shows every single finger mark, smudge mark etc. It's somewhat oddly shaped for a tablet. Seems excessively wide, too wide to sit in my bluetooth keyboard that is designed to hold tablets in the 10\" (+/-) range. The power cord is short and odd. Out of the box the speakers are not loud enough. Downloading a volume booster app will fix this problem but does distort the sound to some degree. Not so much that it is an issue. This tablet looks like it would damage rather easily if dropped.\n\nWhen turned on the lines on the screen are not noticeable. While viewing videos I don't notice any screen related issues. The display meets expectation. The tablet seems zippy enough and has had no issues with playing videos, a few games and surfing the web. I love the fact that it has a standard usb port as I like to use a mouse with it. I've been using it for a month or so and have not experienced any hardware related issues. I leave it plugged in while in use so I cannot comment on battery life experience. Considering the battery size (7200mAh) vs battery life other users have experienced.... battery life sucks.\n\nPros: It excels my expectations in responsiveness. The standard USB port is a major plus. Software doesn't feel bloated, comes with Marshmallow, cheap price. Have had zero hardware/software related issues. Good for watching movies.\n\nCons: all in the build. Put together really, really poorly. Feels cheap, like the smallest drop would destroy it. Looks and feels like a budget tablet.\n\nIt gets 3 stars because it meets my needs and runs well. Had it not been so cheaply put together I would have rated 5 stars for performance and price."}

The reason for two stars if the quality is above par is that it had a significant wifi connectivity problem.  Looking through the other reviews it seems this is not an isolated incident.  I was hoping I would luck out and not have any problems but it would drop the connection every 1 - 3 minutes with no reliability.  the problem persisted regardless of which wifi connection i was connected to or what settings were set up on the tablet.

Everything work great for the first 4-5 hrs with no problem to be seen yet, then after full charged any video i watched start to have stutter/jitter (delay then suddenly went fast forward few secs, sometime it's only the video and sometime both of video/audio) occassionally. So i decided to get rid apps that i downloaded one by one except bear no fruit until i used the factory reset just incase. New problem show up, a distinct sound of turning on gas stove (happen everytime you turn on the tablet) except this time happen everytime i interact with opening up apps or browse around (using headphone makes it worse, annoying as hell). I didn't know this tablet only last less than a day for my excitement. The day that supposed to be a great day turned out to be a big disappointment."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01865QFJA", "review": "I think I'm going to really like this tablet. There's not much in the way of instructions that come with it, but if you're used to working with tablets in general, you won't have any problems with the Fusion5 10.6\" tablet. I'm a little disappointed that the screen protective film that came with it and already installed, is so shiny. I've looked everywhere to see if I might be able to replace it with an anti-glare screen film for this particular tablet, but so far the only kind I can find are the clear shiny ones. But I might just have to learn how to hold it to reduce the glare on the screen. That is my only complaint and such a very minor one.\n\nOne other reviewer commented that this Fusion5 was \"snappy.\" It is indeed! I love how fast it is in just about everything it can do. And I'm impressed with all the things it can do! For me, this tablet is replacing my mini-iPad and an old laptop computer which are in the process of giving up the ghost. This tablet is definitely going replace those items nicely.\n\nI don't much like using on-screen keyboards so I'm glad that my new Fusion5 can support a Bluetooth external keyboard which I have ordered (with case), but it hasn't yet arrived so I can't let you know how well that works. But I am anticipating that it will work as well as all the other features of this tablet. And I like the fact that the tablet has an USB port for my external mouse. And that it has an SD card slot to expand the memory. Super wonderful.\n\nSo far I haven't figured out how I'm going to charge the tablet while in my car because it comes with a wall charger. It's too bad that it isn't the kind of charger that can be used either in the wall or via USB.\n\nConnecting the tablet to my wireless in-home network was a breeze. In fact, the crazy little thing ALMOST had itself connected and had my contacts all downloaded without my help. That was a great relief because I don't like having to troubleshoot to figure out why things don't connect, which happened with other devices I've purchased.\n\nI love all the apps that are available through Google Play! And this little tablet was fast as lightening in getting the ones I wanted to be downloaded.\n\nI am not a technology wiz, and I'm not a paid reviewer. Just a customer who knows what they like. I give this little Fusion5 tablet an A+.\n\nUPDATE: Oops! I was too hasty writing this review--I wrote it before trying out the USB port. Turns out that it didn't  work. I've returned it to the seller (Fudion5) but they have yet to send out a replacement, even though they received the defective one a week ago. They were so fast at getting my initial purchase to me but they are pretty slow at handling returns and getting replacements sent out."}

This was a repeat issue and seems to even happen once the cover is in place for a bit.  Second is not a problem with the tablet its self but just something that is annoying, the glare!

OK, for one the item description on Amazon said that it had Android 6.0 installed on it as the operating system, BUT the tablet that I received has 5.1.1. But as a user what I want is gadget that will work predictably, stably and satisfactorily--- and it does. It charges from zero to full in about 4 hours and some minutes if I use the AC adapter that came with it and plug it into the wall directly. It takes much longer to charge if I plug it into a usb-port of my desktop, or into a standalone  6-port Poweradd usb wall-charger I purchased here on Amazon. I can also plug it into the usb-port of my kamashi 10,000 mAh power-bank I purchased on Amazon. So the charging time is fastest using the AC charger, about 4 hours and some minutes, and can be as long as 19 hours using a usb-port of a computer or a power-bank. As for the gadget-quality, its an excellent Android tablet 10.6 inches, larger than the other tablets most of which are 10.1 inches, I also purchased a case for it made by Fusion 5, and its a formidable combination since the case is tailor-made for this tablet and no adaptation is needed.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B01865QFJA", "review": "I purchased this Fusion5 to replace an Asus TF101 running ICS. The OS on my TF101 was so old many apps would no longer run, and I couldn't find an easy way to upgrade. I decided to update to a newer tablet with Marshmallow. I use mainly for email and surfing.\nThe Fusion5 is fast, image clear and plenty of memory. As was noted in other reviews, the case shows fingerprint easily due to the gloss black finish. I also purchased a 64G card to extend memory. Inserting the SD card was a little tricky in comparison to my TF101 (or my phone for that matter), but that's a one time deal. It formats it to a Fusion5 format, so I'm not sure I could take it out and read it externally if I had to, but I haven't tried that yet. Another thing I noticed is that battery life is less than my old TF101. If I wasn't using it, I could leave it on all week and still have power. I can't do that with the Fusion5, but again, I just have to remember to plug in more often.\n==UPDATE==: Recently, my tablet froze while loading the OS. Tried to perform a soft reset, no change, tried to perform a hard reset by pressing every combination of buttons, but still no luck. I have a screen that says \"No Operation\", and am unable to do anything else with it. Unable to connect through USB to a PC to debug. There is NO HELP on the Fusion5 website. Time to shop for another tablet, and it WON'T be a Fusion5."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B01865QFJA", "review": "I purchased this as a cheap add on to use with my android media center. It runs the apps I need it to run, connects them to my android tv box and works fine for my specific use.\n\nOverall, for me, this works and I'm somewhat satisfied. I was looking for a cheap, \"no frills\" basic device, and that is exactly what I got.\n\nBut... if you are buying this to have as a primary general purpose tablet, you might want to spend a few more $ and get something decent. If I were to buy another, I wouldn't buy this one again.\n\nFirst: it has a \"cheap plastic\" feel to it. I feel as though it would easily break if I handled it too rough. I would not give this to a child to use without getting a sturdy case for it.\n\nThe screen had a screen protector on it. That would be a cool \"plus\" except it was poorly applied and had several air bubbles in it that I couldn't get out. It annoyed me and I removed it completely. I'm hoping they didn't put it on because the screen scratches or cracks too easy. So far it hasn't happened, but certainly makes me wonder.\n\nThe power and volume buttons are not in a place where it would be natural to look for them. I find myself fumbling for them every time I turn it on. Something you can get use to, but what were they thinking?\n\nIt isn't as \"fast\" as other reviewers seem to think it is. I don't know what they are comparing it to, but I find it rather sluggish when opening apps, connecting to wifi and other basic task. Not an issue for my usage, but I would find it annoying if it was my primary tablet.\n\nThe camera: forget about it. I don't care how many megapixels it has, the lens on the cameras are horrible. The pictures were so blurry I though maybe I forgot to take the protective plastic shipping film off the camera lens. But nope. Just a horrible lens that can't quite focus on anything. Fortunately the camera isn't a deal breaker for my use.\n\nThe sound: yeah you can hear it. That's about it. If you want to listen to music with any kind of fidelity - you are going to need to connect to a Bluetooth speaker. The speaker in the tablet is the most basic of basic.\n\nThis isn't a high end Samsung tablet, but the price isn't that of a high end tablet either. As a first tablet or something to use for a specific purpose, you probably won't be too dissapointed. If you want a full featured quality tablet, you are going to have to spend a lot more than what this cost."}

AC Charger is shot at barrel connector. I tend to think this was operator error as my lady is hard on hardware, but it's a crappy design. Had it not been for my purchasing an additional USB to barrel connector I would have an nonchargeable brick.\n2.) Unit DOES NOT come with a USB to barrel connector, (so be sure to buy one if you buy this).\n3.) As mentioned elsewhere, it does seem to take a long time to charge. I view this as a feature, as it limits the hazard to it by the aforementioned lady who is hard on hardware.\n4.) It does not come with a case, so be prepared to shell out another $15 or so for that too.\n5.) It does not come with the microSD card, so be prepared to shell out even more for that.\n\nAll told I think I dropped around $150USD for it. Would I buy it again? Ask me 6 months.\nHey, Fusion5, mind sending me another AC adapter?\nThanks,\nPanochey\n\nUpdate: 8/28/2017:\nSo I am now ordering yet another AC adapter for the Fusion5. Seriously folks, why on Earth did you use a flimsy 2.5mm barrel adapter? These thing snaps like twigs in the wind. And yes, the speaker output is weak, and the battery sucks dry faster than water in the Sahara. Hence the heavy reliance on the charge adapter, hence the stress on the adapter barrel.

If you want something that you can sit in your chair and search the web, read email, use Google apps, play games, or a great tablet for young ones, this is an excellent choice. I refer to games as something a non-gamer would play. Battery only hangs for about five hours or so, but enough time to watch a couple of movies.

After placing it in my computer backpack (with it in a case), putting my backpack in the back seat of my truck, and taking a 200 mile road trip, when I arrived the screen was cracked and the touch screen no longer worked.  Being that the touchscreen is required for the thing to even function, the tablet is now junk.  I also didn't like the touchscreen when it was working.  At times it was not responsive except for a heavy finger press and at other time it was too sensitive and recorded touches when my finger hadn't quite touched the screen.  Got 2 stars instead of 1 because the processor is fast and the Android operating system worked well on it.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B01865QFJA", "review": "When I received the tablet, I thought it was pretty good for the price and would have given it 4 stars.  However, after 10 months, I plugged it in to charge and it would never come on again.  I contacted the company (you have to contact them through Amazon), and they were prompt in their response and had me return it.  In less than two weeks, I received another tablet, which I thought was great.  When setting up my tablet, everything was fine, but when I walked into the other room, it lost Wi-Fi signal, and when I say it lost signal, it couldn't even recognize that there was a Wi-Fi anywhere. If you stayed in the room with the router, you could get fair signal (maybe good if you wanted to stand right beside it).  I have seven other wireless devices that get good signal throughout my house.  I contacted the company again and went through a lot of things they wanted me to try, including downloading some Wi-Fi booster app from the Play Store (really??).  Of course, that didn't work and neither did the other things they wanted me to try.  So, they told me to send it back again.  It was returned to me with my Wi-Fi still saved on it, and it still functioned exactly the same.  The company said I would have to return it again with a new return slip stating the new problem since this was different than the original problem (and they couldn't have told me that before they told me to return it the second time?).  Did that, and received the same tablet back again, and the problem is still the same.  After contacting the company again, I was told that they tested the Wi-Fi and that it functioned up to 10 meters.  I can guarantee that that had to be within line of sight of the router, because it loses it when you put a wall between you and the router.  I looked up the specs for their Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11) and it states that the typical indoor range should be about 30 meters.  Apparently, the 10 meter range is considered acceptable by this company.  Now I am out the cost of shipping this three times for nothing.  Should have applied that to the price of a different tablet.  Had my original tablet functioned like this one, I would have returned it immediately for a refund.  Buyer beware!  Worst customer service ever!"}

The battery lasts a long time.  There are two probelms with it that we found.  1- the screen is not that bright on the highest setting (for comparison it is darker than our galaxy tab s, nexus 10, and a Lenovo tab).  It works fine but once in brighter than indoor light the screen becomes difficult to see.  But it becomes a deal breaker when you add problem 2 in.  2- the factory preinstalled screen protector is super glare ENHANCING.  we went outside to sit on the porch during the day (in the shade) and the tablet was unusable.  I was surfing away on the nexus10 and she couldn't see a thing on the fusion5.  I tried.  I couldn't use it either.  Plus it came with bubbles in the screen like other reviewers said.  I searched high and low and could not find replacement screen protectors on amazon.  It would drive me nuts to keep the tablet and not be able to get rid of the bubbles on the screen.  So unless you can find a matte or glare reducing screen protector this won't work for us.  And we really wanted to keep it.  It is fast but the wife said if she couldn't read it, it was useless.  So she opted for a slower tablet (lenovo tab a) that had a brighter screen and I can find different screen protectors.  Hope this helps."}

It's really faint.\n\nThe build quality feels flimsy, but now that I've got it in a folio case, that's not really an issue.\n\nSo why 4 stars? The screen is great.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01865QFJA", "review": "I've had this tablet for over a month now. I waited to submit a review so that I could provide an accurate and thorough review.\n\nOverall, I gave the Fusion5, 5 stars because I love it (even though there are a couple of things that are lacking). The picture is great whether I am on YouTube, Netflix, Hulu, etc, it actually came with Android 6.0, it's not too heavy. The main reason I bought this tablet was to interface with my Google apps that I use regularly (Google Drive, Google Play, Sky Maps), for reading (Amazon Kindle App), streaming music and videos.\n\n~ I've seen many reviews stating the tablet charges slowly. I found that if I use the 5V AC charger that came with the tablet, it charges fairly quickly. If I use a micro USB charger, it takes days to get a full charge. I recommend either using the 5V AC charger that it came with or ordering another one (make sure it states 5V AC otherwise it will not work properly).\n\n~ I saw a review or 2 saying it cut off and would not turn on. That is a simple fix, there is a reset button where the SD card slot is located, press it for a few seconds. It will make the tablet reboot. Hold it any longer than 5 seconds and you will reset your tablet.\n\n~ The speakers really aren't that great but I have Bluetooth speakers and headphones so that really isn't an issue plus there are times when a low volume works for me, like when I am working (I talk on the phone a lot for work).\n\n~ It does NOT have a gyroscope!\n\n~ The only other thing I didn't like all that much is that it tells you when you connect to Wifi that it is connected but there is no internet. This is just the marshmallow version doing this as it is having trouble reaching Google's servers. You should actually be able to surf just fine and you can select the option to connect anyway."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B01865QFJA", "review": "Cannot recommend.  I will keep it and use it as a backup only.  The unit is extremely slippery and can be prone to breaking without a cover if dropped or banged. Attempted to install a Samsung Evo 32Gb Micro SD card and received a message saying it was incompatible although the card works with all my phones and other tablets runing Android 6.0 and up.  Android 6 is crippled on this machine and does not represent a good Android experience.  It is not stock Android.  I have two other tablets with less RAM and they are much more efficient in processing and an overall better experience.  There is considerable lag on this machine when using apps and the Web through Chrome. The machine is prone to freezing and turning itself off.  Overall, not happy at all with this purchase and this machine is probably OK for a kid or someone who doesn't mind its drawbacks an will use it primarily for email and perhaps some very light gaming.  Although a really budget machine, its price should be much lower considering what you get."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B01865QFJA", "review": "Yes, this device has excellent specifications for a tablet of it's price (on paper). However the posted specs do not mean much when it comes to actual performance. One example, is because the CPU has no L1 or L2 cache, multitasking is horribly slow. Actually, everything is slow. Also, the tablet is made extremely cheap. Cheap plastic (typical of items made in \"that country\"). However, for the price, I would keep it because it's perfectly fine for web browsing but that's really about it, but luckily that's what I mostly use it for. Now, why I will not be keeping it: The first unit I received the screen was partially detached from the body and had cracks in it. I returned it, had them exchange it, dealt with the shippers lack of Amazon Prime snail mail shipping, and then the replacement unit I had to send back because when it arrived was actually missing the power button, therefore there was no way to even turn it on. Waited for a third unit to arrive finally, and it came 2 days ago. Finally one that appeared intact, physically anyway. Excited I quickly installed all my apps and games, only to find out that none of my games work because it is impossible to control movement by moving the unit. I figured, OK, perhaps the accelerometer needs calibration. No big deal, so I do the normal procedure by moving the device in a figure 8 pattern, and install some sensor reading apps that also can calibrate it. Guess what! No accelerometer detected. That explains that! To be clear, the device is equipped with the sensor, that there is no doubt. It has to be since it's built into this model CPU! However like most things with this tablet, it's defective. So I have no way of ever playing a game on it. I suspected there might be a problem with the sensor since the screen is incapable of auto-rotating (a function that relies on the accelerometer). So, my advice after owning literally hundreds of Android phones and tablets from every manufacturer you could think of, is while it's possible I guess to get a stable unit, how long it will last is an entirely different issue, so I would strongly advise spending a bit more and getting a Samsung, LG, HTC, or another established brand. At least at a bare minimum, with the big brands, if something does go wrong, you would actually receive at least a bare minimum of support from them. Good luck!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01865QFJA", "review": "An excellent tablet at a fantastic price! This just came yesterday, so I don't know how well it will last, but everything so far has more than exceeded my expectations. The start up went well and downloaded all my Android apps very quickly. The large screen size is especially helpful to me because I am very visually impaired. The screen clarity is also great! An added bonus is that it has been updated to the Android 6.0 \"Marshmallow\" operating system. Also, while it comes only with Wi-Fi capabilities, it does support 3G USB Dongle. My only slight criticism is that the 16GB memory is small. I did easily expand it with a 64GB micro SD card. Overall, I'm very happy with this tablet."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B01865QFJA", "review": "Had the Fusion5 for a few weeks and the screen cracked from the slightest touch. Poor material. Sent it back and they replaced the tablet. My Son put the tablet on the table, evidently left the power on, it overheated and when he got back from school, there was another crack in it. The crack did not occur from any mishandling, I'm certain of that. Now that there is a slight crack in the upper quadrant of the tablet, no other functionality of touch works. Cannot shut it down, cannot close out programs, cannot swipe items closed, NOTHING. The screen becomes totally unresponsive. I've had phones that have fallen off my bike while riding and they smashed to hell and still functioned. This thing is made cheap and it's not made to last. My suggestion is forego wasting your money and get something that is built better that at least the whole thing doesn't stop functioning on you when there's a slight crack in the screen. Or one that doesn't overheat all the time or one that doesn't crack without a reason. My Samsung Tab  is older than dirt and has a crack in it and functions perfectly without issue. This thing is a waste of money."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B01865QFJA", "review": "I was on the market for a new tablet for my son for Christmas. I bought this on 12/22/16 got it just in time for him to open on Christmas. That's were the fun begins..... The tablet started out OK. I noticed that they claim that the tablet can use a 64gb SD card and also update to marshmallow Android 6.0. which was a must since you can use as card as  internal memory when using marshmallow. 16gb won't cut it especially since you really only get 12. So my tablet (the first one) wouldn't registered the card. I thought it was because it was a 64gb and it says right on the tablet expandable up to 32gb. So I tried another card I had a 32 GB card from hi previous one. Still doesn't work. So I email them tell them it's not working and I can't get Android 6.0. turns out they had to send me a card through the mail to get the software upgrade. They also assured me that 64gb will work with this tablet. So I had to wait about a week. Got the card was able to update to marshmallow. Awesome right!? Well still would read any of my cards. They then told me I had to format the SD card specifically to thier tablets standards. OK fine I do that took about 15-20mins. Still wouldn't work. So they told me to send it out and it would be fixed. They don't have a mailing label so they told me I had to pay for shipping. I told them that's not right and they told me well they can cover 10. It cost 15 to ship. Whatever. So it took about 2 weeks to receive. Keep in mind this was a Christmas gift. My son wasn't able to really use his present for almost a month through now. Got the tablet. Saw that it was not the Same tablet I sent them. There were visible lines that go horizontal on the screen that's visible when the tablet is off. And somewhat visible when on but not really. Then I noticed the SD card door adhesive was off so the door was broken. I immediately sent them an email and told them about it and they said we are sorry that shouldn't happen. Send it back to us we will cover 10 of your shipping and fix/replace it once we receive it. Are you kidding me!? Please save yourself the hassle and time. Don't order this. I understand that there are defective u it's and it happens from time to time but the way they handled it was ridiculous."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B01865QFJA", "review": "I'll start by saying that I bought this tablet because my Samsung Note 10.1 died suddenly and I wanted a 10 inch replacement to hold me over until the new Samsung Chromebooks arrived. Hopefully it will serve that purpose, at which time I can pitch it in the trash. I liked the size, memory, quad core processor, and fairly up to date OS.\n\nAfter setting everything up and restoring the apps from my Samsung backup I discovered there was no way to change the display brightness. The display settings are there but they do nothing. I sent feedback to the seller and got a useless response to which I replied that there seemed to be other problems related to sensors that are present but not functioning. <crickets> In particular the magnetic sensors seem locked at one end of their range so apps that need a compass fail. I suspect that may be the reason that the newest version of Maps refuses to launch so I've had to uninstall updates and roll Maps back to the version originally installed. Of course that also means you have to turn off auto updates and deal with that stuff manually in Play. BTW, if you check under settings in Play you'll find this is not a certified system.\n\nOn the plus side, the display is nice and games play OK. Network performance is pretty good and sometimes you can get it to screencast. The latter may work more consistently with the Roku but I haven't played with that yet.\n\nBottom line - if you need a fully functional tablet, look elsewhere. I just hope this one holds out until I can replace it with a Samsung 2 in 1 Chromebook."}

Never had a cell phone, do not want one. I wanted a tablet for other things like surfing, music and videos.  The postage stamp sized manual with this thing is garbage. This is the worst documentation I have seen in my entire life!!!! I spent $175 total on this THING and have had to worry friends and anyone I could to try and do for myself over the past 2 weeks what a real manual would have told me how to do in just a few hours. I could not find help from the manufacturer or Amazon anywhere, no help on line. This is a really fine device. If you have not had a cell phone glued to you 24-7 for many years then RUN!!!! This pitiful documentation will NOT HELP YOU ONE LITTLE BIT, you will be on your own!!!!!!"}

The 10 inch is perfect for my wife to use to access sheet music when she's performing. It's a fine machine for streaming TV/movies. My wife also enjoys the large screen for her solitaire and other simple games. For us non-power-users this machine is a very good value for our money, I highly recommend it if your needs and desires seem similar to ours. While I would not buy this machine for making high quality images, the screen quality and size are just fine for quick editing of images using the appropriate apps."}

The main failings are performance, battery life and audio.\n\nPerformance is sluggish.  Switching between programs and even between tabs in the browser is very slow. Startup time is over 1.5 minutes.  And because of the awful battery life, the tablet in constantly shutting down so you have to frequently wait for the tablet to boot.\n\nBattery life is awful.  I'm getting maybe 3 to 4 hours on a single charge.  This means that you can't use the tablet for a day without having to charge it.  So the freedom to roam around the home with the tablet is compromised  because you need to be near the charging cable.\n\nAudio - it is a disgrace how bad the audio is.  Very tinny. The max volume is not louder than a whisper.  Really, this is the best that they could do?\n\nI've been tempted many times to return this tablet.

The kicker is that it wasn't dropped or abused. It was simply being held (in a case no less!) and apparently my 8 year old sons grip was enough to break it? I find that hard to comprehend. These things are delicate as heck. I have asked Fusion5 to help me with this - their warranty says they won't fix damage done by the buyer - but if  the tiny hand of an 8 year old can crack the screen while just holding it in his hands - they really need to help me out with this. Will further update when I hear back from them.\n\nI bought one for my son, and my aunt bought one for me from the exact same link / listing. The one I bought my son works fairly well - but the one my aunt bought - supposed to be the same item, same version - is garbage! The boxes were shaped differently. The one I bought had European and US charger. The one my aunt sent had only US charger. They both start up the same way with the same splash screen. The one bought for me is extremely slow. It constantly behaves as if I am touching it all over the screen even if I am not touching it at all. The calibration of the touch screen when I *DO* touch it is completely wrong.\n\nI can't believe the same listing for the same product could produce two such Dramatically different behaving devices. So I can't rate this well at all. I'm very upset and I haven't got the heart to tell my aunt the one she sent me is such garbage. :("}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B01865QFJA", "review": "I'm returning it. I really hated to do so because with the exception of it freezing a couple of times a day it functioned really well. The problem is it takes 16 to 18 hours to recharge and only lasts 3 and a half hours or so under normal usage watching movies or watching videos on youtube. See the attached photo battery life was at 47% and it says it still has 13hrs until full. Also it would not charge while in use. I think that I was just unlucky and got a bad one because on one other person mentions this issue. A side note is the one that I received was an open box, the security tabs had been opened but the tablet did not appear to be used. It was a Christmas gift for my nine year old daughter, she loved it in spite of the serious issues. I am stuck with a zebra case (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01GO6OU7M/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)  and a 64GB microSD (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B010Q588D4/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s03?ie=UTF8&psc=1) , both of which worked well and I highly recommend them if you own this tablet and yours is functioning properly. I may order another because of the case and the microSD, I haven't decided yet."}

(I do not even have what they call a \"smart phone\".  I still use my old flip phone, aka a \" stupid phone\"). The first thing I appreciated about FUSION is that I received two emails from the family owned company asking for feedback as well as assuring me that they support their products 100%. For that alone, I recommend this brand to anyone.  As for this model, so far, I have found it to be easy to use, pretty much self explanatory with a nice display that can be adjusted to your personal tastes. My sister has a more expensive Samsung Galaxy and I feel this, especially for the price, blows the Samsung away. I haven't gotten as deeply into it as I will in the future but as far as my Kindle collection, email and various apps, so far everything is working as hoped. As I use it more I may have some added good or bad opinions but again, it sounds like FUSION is a company that takes care of their customers. Highly recommended!"}

I found the fusion. It's 10.5 inches  extremely fast and it has an Android operating system so you just go to Google Apps to get whatever you need. It uses Wi-Fi but has several different attachments. What I love is that it only has a few apps on it. So what we put on it is what we get. This makes it faster and more efficient. You're not constantly looking through pages of apps trying to find a specific one. And its operating system works the same as an Android telephone."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B01865QFJA", "review": "I purchased two Fusion5 108 tablets as early Christmas presents for my wife & I; they arrived promptly and in undamaged condition.  I've been using my tablet for about a week now, & overall I'm quite satisfied with my purchase; the display is bright & clear, and the processor seems sufficiently fast & responsive.  There are a few issues, however, that are not so great IMO:\n\n1. When the screen turns on, there's an audible \"snap\" sound and sometimes a little flash; this makes me concerned for the long-term durability of the display panel (I checked to ensure the device's interface sounds were turned off in case this was a design feature). (UPDATE 02/08/2017: This problem seems to have largely gone away -- possibly the unit just needed a break-in period to resolve itself.)\n\n2. The tablet seems to have some difficulty in maintaining WiFi connections; I connect to a local Xfinity hotspot at work, & while my phone (A Samsung S5) has no trouble staying connected, I find I sometimes need to reconnect my tablet a couple times per day. (UPDATE 02/08/2017: This issue now seems to have resolved itself; I don't drop connections anymore.)\n\n3. The bluetooth connection to my wireless headphones (MPOW Cheetahs) is strong & clear most of the time, but sometimes suffers from an annoying \"stutter\" that goes away if I reconnect the headphones and/or reboot the tablet.  I'm not sure if that's a limitation of the tablet's internal Bluetooth stack or the Android Lollipop OS, or something else entirely. (UPDATE 02/08/2017: This issue seems to have resolved itself; I no longer have have any connectivity or playback issues with Bluetooth -- possibly the unit just needed a break-in period.)\n\n4. Finally, and for me this is the most irritating issue, when using the tablet in portrait mode, sometimes the display refuses to register touch input (particularly in the case of pop-up windows), forcing me to turn it 90 degrees to landscape before it will accept my input.\n\n(UPDATE 02/08/2017: This sometimes happens in landscape mode as well, & the fix is the same -- turn it 90 degrees & hope the spot you want to click will respond now.  Now that I've had a couple months to use it, it appears there may be a full or partial touch-sensor \"dead zone\" somewhere in the middle of the display. For example, I play the game Fallout Shelter quite a lot lately, and one of the main activities is dragging people from one room to another; very often I'll lose connection to who I'm moving while dragging them across the middle of the screen, & the only way I've found around it so far is to move my view around enough to where I can drag a person without having to cross the \"dead zone\".  I clean the display regularly but have had no success in clearing this up on my own.  The tablet did come with a screen protector pre-installed; I suppose it's possible it could be blocking or dampening the capacitive response, but I'm hesitant to try removing it -- the screen is only standard glass vs. Corning Gorilla Glass or the like so I don't want to render it any more vulnerable, plus I'm concerned I may end up damaging the screen myself in the process of removing the protector.)\n\nNone of these are deal-breakers for me (I can't expect Samsung or Apple performance from a $130 tablet after all), but they are still annoying.  In the end though, I can certainly recommend this tablet for an enjoyable experience that won't break your bank!\n\n(UPDATE 02/08/2017: I've tried contacting Fusion5 support through their website several times now to address the touch-sensor issue, and as of yet I've heard no response, not even a canned \"we've received your message\" reply to let me know I'm not just shouting into the void.  That's rather disappointing for a company that touts its customer service as a selling point.)"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01865QFJA", "review": "This tablet is just AWESOME. The best part of this tablet is not just the 2GB RAM but all the many ports it has. You won't find too many tablets with this many ports. The best port is the mini HDMI. I tested it out on my 40\" PC monitor. It sends picture flawlessly. Its great for presentations. You don't even need a laptop with this tablets. Its very impressive.  Watch my you tube video I made on this product. You will be definitely impressed.  The Cortex processor and Ram runs smooth. All my APPS have been running really smooth. I have not tried games. I don't want to push it. But it can handle games. The only thing about this tablets is that it does not let you transfer apps to your SD card. For now 16 GB is okay.  2nd thing is the volume is low on this device, but you can get Apps on google play and boost volume. I specified the type in my video.

After repeated tries, I emailed Fusion5 through Amazon, they replied immediately and sent a form with instructions to mail for service, but I had thrown away the shipping box and was looking for another.  I made one last try and saw a fleeting view of an empty battery so, hoping for the best, I plugged it in.  It is now working perfectly as the amazing tablet others say it is.  The same day my Blu Vivo XL (Type C, different room) went black on the charger and would't boot.  Luckily, I found a new T-Mobile store where a nice young man worked on it 'til he finally saw a glimmer of a battery and it began charging, so I took it home and it's now working perfectly too.\n\nThen I saw an electrician in my building and asked him about power fluctuations.  \"Remember,\" he said, \"all the bottom plugs are for lamps and turn on and off at the switch.\"  Mystery solved!

Another problem was with the audio. Although the audio was nice and clear, the volume level was very low. I also found out that it had changed my sd card from 32 gig to 16 gig.

The battery is okay, not the greatest but for the price I didn't expect the world. The screen is bright and clear. It has plenty of memory for what I need. I can only assume that the individuals giving negative ratings are expecting iPad performance. It's not an iPad, but it's not $500 either. If you have reasonable expectations, you're going to like this tablet and its definitely worth the ~$120 price.  I would definitely recommend this product to a friend."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01865QFJA", "review": "This tablet is in a class by itself. If your looking for a powerhouse to run all the latest games this is your best bet. I have ran the latest games on this tablet and it handles them with ease, Also I can confirm it will accept a 64GB SD card so you will have plenty of space for your apps. Grab one while you can get it at on sell you will not be sorry.\n**Update** After having had this tablet for nearly 4 months I thought an update review was in order. Tablet is still in great working order. I have had zero issues and have learned a few new helpful things about it. Firstly I can confirm this tablet will accept and utilize a 128gb SD card. I have also learned that you can enhance battery life significantly without affecting performance by using battery saver function. I have been using this function and have not noticed any slowdown in performance at all. You can enable this function by going to settings\\battery top right side a drop down menu battery saver. This will bring up the menu where you can enable it. By using this you are looking at over an hour extra extended battery life possibly more depending on what you are doing. This is definitely worth looking in to."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B01865QFJA", "review": "I really like this tablet...the look, performance, specs...all just great...So what's not  to like: Wouldn't start after about a day...I  shut it down, plugged in the charger and  noticed that  the battery icon didn't come on the way it usually  does. So I  tried to restart it...nothing. I tried  holding the power button down for various  times up to a minute...each no start. I plugged in a micro-USB to PC...no battery icon...no start. So  I  sat it down on my desk and sent an email to Fusion5 [goto  Your Account on Amazon then orders..see  menu] explaining it was dead and requesting  return. Shortly after sending the  email, the tablet came to  life..on it's own...it flickered, but I was able to  restart it...after that it was  stable...for a day...then it bricked again and repeated efforts would not revive it. I  was going to return  it to Fusion5 for replacement  but  since  they didn't offer to pay shipping to their location, I'm returning it  to  Amazon for  credit back to my card...Amazon provide prepaid shipping label and  UPS pick-up..Yeah.\nDespite my bad experience this tablet I  may reorder because there don't appear  to be a lot  of other  reviews citing \"won't start\" and brick..and I really liked it  when  it worked. If do reorder and get a  stable, reliable tablet, I'll update this review and boost the star count.\nMeanwhile, if  anyone has had a similar  experience with not starting, please comment on  my review."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01865QFJA", "review": "Tablet had good ratings, so I bought it.  Ratings were not wrong, in the least bit.  Tablet is fast.  Easily tapped in to my wi-fi.  Then, started downloading all of my favorite media apps.  Fast.  My old tablets (Toshiba and Asus) never downloaded this fast.\nOnce the programs were downloaded, I accessed one while some others were still downloading and installing.  Still fast.  My Asus would time out and not move.  Not this one.  Acts like it's nothing.\nLooked for all of the normal Google bloatware that I normally disable.  Not there.  Several less things to slow it down.\nSome complained about the picture density.  Picture looks sharp without any blurring or artifacts.\nSound is really low, so I am using a wireless headset with it when watching Youtube and Netflix.  Casts to my Vizio tv easily.\nBattery life is a bit more than 4 hours.  I have only used it for 4 hours at a time before recharging it (about 1/8-1/4 left).\nAll and all, an excellent tablet.  Showed it to several coworkers when the price dropped the day before Turkey Day and they jumped on the sale price ($30 less than what I paid.)  I think I got a good deal.  Just they got a little better.  That's the way the cookie crumbles during the holidays."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B01865QFJA", "review": "So: I've been using Android tablets for a couple of years now - maybe three years. Always budget-class. It was time to go up a notch, jumping in price by $40 to $50. That got me double the RAM (this device, 2 GB) and the superior display technology. Also, this unit sports a rare feature: a real (full-size) USB 2.0 port that you'll never find on a cheapo model. The battery, while still not user-replaceable the way I'd like it to be (good luck finding that), at least is a whole lot bigger than my old ones.\n\nI have had this one about a week. Initially I worked with it all day to set it up like my last tablet. It performed very well. Installing my long list of favorite apps, fiddling with a lot of settings, getting the font to look big enough, etc. - all of it went like buttah.\n\nThen I got to the copying of my old files, which I had put onto a stick drive for the occasion. TILT!!!! Inserting the stick drive into that full-size USB port caused the device to simply konk out. *Immediately.* Total blackness. And it refused to reboot. Panic... I hunted and hunted for a \"reset hole\" - you know, where you poke with a paper clip. NOT. There isn't one. Or it's so hidden it escaped me. I looked for quite some time, even behind the trapdoor which hides the SD card slot.\n\nThe booklet in the box was of no help. It explains a little about using Android, but nothing much about the tablet itself. I phoned Amazon - no tech help there, but we arranged a return & refund.\n\nThus I was very close to sending the thing back. Just then I tried to boot it up again - an hour after the problem began - and it worked. So I'm keeping it unless the glitch repeats. So far so good.\n\nThe superior screen is dazzling, very sharp, with good colors and the advertised viewing angle. The 2 GB RAM just zips along. I did get to copy all those old files using the full-size USB port. That went swimmingly - so fast I was really impressed. The bigger battery gives me lengthy times between charges.\n\nOverall, summarizing: it's fast, the screen's excellent, great battery capacity. But... there was that bad glitch w/the full-size USB port. The 'instruction' booklet is so generic it's useless. And there's no reset thingie (as far as I know).\n\nBTW I don't think I'll be trying the cameras, but the one on the back looks pretty respectable w/5 megapixels & some kind of zoom... a good selling point for some people."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01865QFJA", "review": "First off, I'm gonna use my tablet for Multimedia. That is its sole purpose. Watching videos, movies and playing games.\n\nNow, I've actually done extensive research online by watching youtube reviews of all different tablets from $49-$300, meticulously reading almost all 163 reviews of this tablet and countless others on the different tablets Amazon,BestBuy,Walmart and Ebay(to name a few) sells. I've been looking up this info for about 1 week now nonstop!\n\nThese are my findings and I hope it helps someone else:\n\nPROS:\n1. It's very snappy and speedy thanks to the 2GB RAM.\nThis runs KODI perfectly and flawlessly. It runs it better than my PC! Also, it runs any game I've thrown at it perfectly. There's no lag whatsoever.\n2. Screen quality is awesome. Period.\nIt looks crisp and clear at 1366x768. It has great viewing angles w/ no \"burn-out\" on screen. Colors are very vivid. That's one of the reasons I decided on this one. It's the only one w/ this resolution at this price and let's face it, 90% of the tablet is going to be the screen.\n3. For this price point, I think you're gonna have a hard time finding a better tablet. Let's dare to compare, shall we?\nThis tablet is almost on par with the Samsung Tab A! Same 2GB/16GB storage, they both use an octa-core processor. Only differences I can see is Sammy has 1920x1200 res,Touchwiz ui and its 10.1\" whereas this one is 10.6\". Price for this one-I paid $99.97 and Samsung is $197.\nI picked Samsung b/c right now they're one of the best Android manufacturers.\n4. The build quality is awesome, too.\nEven though it is made out of plastic, I don't think it looks cheap at all. I think it's smexy. Guess who else makes their products out of plastic? Ans:Samsung! This one even comes with a screen protector already on it.\n5. There's lots of ports.\nIt has mini HDMI, full size USB port, Micro sd card slot, Micro USB port and a DC port. What could you do w/ all them ports? Wellll...First thing I thought about was hooking up an usb hub to the full size usb port then plugging up a keyboard and mouse. Next, add an external hard drive and charge it with the DC cord. Hehehe. I'm not going to do that but it was fun thinking about the possibilities!\n\nCONS:\nI think they are very minor w/ easy fixes but I felt like they needed to be said. And please remember that this tablet, I guarantee, is the best you're gonna get for this price (which means they had to compromise in some areas to keep it at this price)\n\n1. Speakers are ridiculously low!\nI read the other reviews that also said the speakers were bad and I thought they must be exaggerating (sorry for doubting you guys) They are not!! One way I fixed the issue is I downloaded an app from Google Playstore named SpeakerBoost. Its free. That seemed to help. Also, KODI allows you to amplify the audio among other things while you're using it and that's what I use mainly for my media.\n2. Battery lasts about 5 hrs w/ it being constantly on and screen brightness is ~40%.\nThis is my 1st tablet so I don't know if that's good or bad or what. Again, I downloaded a couple of apps on the Google Playstore. Their names are: DU Battery Saver, DS Battery Saver and Greenify. They all are also free. That really seems to have helped.\n3. Back cover is a fingerprint magnet and it's a little slippery but a cheap case will fix that.\n4.$!@#%-LolliPop! Do I need to say anything else?!\nEven though it's running almost vanilla android, you cannot move any apps to the sdcard at all, but you do get a little over 12GB out of the box so thats nice. I did notice that in settings, you could check for \"FOTG\" updates so maybe it will get Marshmallow?\n\nSupplemental Info:\nI ran some benchmarks.\nAntutu score: it was almost 29000.\nCPUz: it confirmed all the specs that are on the product.\n\nAll in All, this tablet is perfect for me and it honestly beat my expectations. I don't think the pictures do it justice! I would recommend this tablet to anyone and at this price, it's a steal!\n\nOne last thing. I bought this tablet from FUSION5 on Tue. Nov. 22nd w/ free super-saver shipping and it was delivered today at 11:23am! That's unbelievable! Did I mention that I LOVE THIS TABLET!!\n\nUPDATE: 122516\nI still love my tablet. Its perfect for me and I would buy it again. With that said, 2 issues have arisen. Not deal breakers by no means but I feel they need to be mentioned. They are:\n1. As some other reviewers have reported, the screen flickers sometimes. You really notice it when the background is white. If you turn the screen off then back on after about a minute, it goes away. Personally, it doesn't bother me in the least.\n2. Also, everytime you turn the screen on, you hear an audible clicking sound. I have no clue as to what it could be. It doesn't effect the tablets use in any way, though.\n\nUPDATE: 082917\nAfter using this tablet for almost a year now, I can honestly say that this is a great little tablet-as long as you keep your expectations grounded for the above mentioned reasons. I haven't had any troubles with it at all and it just keeps trucking along. One thing to note,as my experience, is that whatever version your tablet comes with, thats what its gonna have FOREVER (as one commented earlier, my version was Lollipop and it still is but if you look at the product desc. it ships with Marshmallow now).I paid just $99 cuz it was around Black Friday but even at the current price, I would totally be willing to buy it again-especially now that there is a Full HD version for a couple of bucks more!"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B01865QFJA", "review": "This is a good tablet for general use. Not fast switching apps  but fast enough once you are using the app. Display resolution is OK and brightness has a wide range. Be careful loading the system from a phone backup via google as it negated the brightness control on mine and would only stay at around 50% brightness. Better to load your apps directly from the Play Store rather than Google backup. Sound volume and quality are standard for this class of tablet and provide basic audio for listening. The bluetooth works great and with an external speaker is my preferred method to listen to music. WIFI also works good and can utilize the newest 5 GHZ band as well as the older 2.5 GHZ band channels.  My communications with the seller had prompt responses and were useful. Note that there are 3 different configurations of the device on Amazon, mine is the 1GB RAM and 32 GB memory system."}

Upon opening the Amazon card board box I was surprised to find the security seals on the tablet box had been opened, so I was thinking I would need to send it back if it was used. I looked at the tablet and found it didn't have any fingerprints and a screen film was still attached so I don't think it was used. I powered it on and it went to setup screens for Android, again indicating it wasn't used. After setup I tried to play a music file and couldn't hear it, so I tried to turn up the volume but the volume switch didn't work.

It has a full size USB port so it will accept a printer, mouse, or keyboard and the cameras (front and back) have good resolution with built in image editing choices. Tablet is lightning fast. 2GB Ram really kicks in when browsing. I did invest in a 64GB memory add on, because I like to keep my library of videos on hand, but it has no problem streaming from YouTube or Netflix. I found their customer service very helpful. All replies were prompt and in less than 24 hours. Great purchase."}

He basically can use it as a mini PC computer since it comes with a standard usb port for thumb drives and be able to plug in an adapter for a Bluetooth mouse without the use of an otg cable or adapter. The HDMI capability was also a big plus. Overall, this is an amazing tablet. A lot of bang for the buck. I may even buy one for myself."}

I cannot express how pleased I am with this purchase, I almost expected the quality to be less than stellar because of the price but I have to say that I was wrong. I have been using the tablet for almost a month now and have had zero issues. The screen is good, graphics are fine, watched several movies and had no issues. I use the tablet quite a bit each day and have no issues with the battery not lasting long enough. If you are looking for an iPad quality tablet then this isn't it but neither is it $700+, if you are just needing a decent everyday kinda tablet then you can't really go wrong with this one."}

It has a lot of memory for the price but it is not very fast and lags on any reasonable graphics display for this level of processor. Also, be prepared that you won't be able to sync it with your PC. No help on the website, but any google search that sends you to device manager and tells you how to select an MTP driver (I know right, who wants to do all this!) should get it recognized. It came on time (it should, I don't know why we write this in reviews!). Okay for the price but I will be looking to upgrade...soon,."}

Then I noticed more white spots all over the black frame. This was before I even booted it up and charged it. I tried to use it. I will say the performance was good the screen resolution was pretty good but I am sending it back. Amazon is wonderful! I also received a link from them to contact the manufacturer. In the description they say over and over they're a USA independent seller and even say something about having USA customer service support\nThis is not true!  The link I was given from Amazon led me only to customer service numbers located in Australia and New Zealand. Woah? If you're from America and you run into a problem like I did, good luck.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01865QFJA", "review": "I purchased the Fusion5 10.6\" 108 OctaCore tablet last week from Amazon Prime, arrived in two days. I also ordered the matching Fusion5 case and I'm quite impressed so far, the case is custom made for this tablet and is worth the price. The large 10.6\" IPS screen is clear, crisp and bright, the screen responds well to touch and feels just right. The ample 2gb of DDR3 RAM  along with the 8 core CPU really make this tablet quick and responsive. I added a 64gb SD card and have no problem moving data to the storage card. I really love the full size USB port, very handy for moving videos and photos to the tablet from my Macbook Pro.\nVideos play very smooth and the wide screen format is really nice for viewing 16:9 format. It's not loaded with bloatware, which seems to be the norm with many tablets or phones. The images on the cameras are decent. Battery life is pretty good, granted it's not 10 hours like my wife's ipad4 Retina but it's a solid 5 hours plus currently. Android 5 Lollipop is a solid OS and is easy to use, actually a bit more user friendly than the version 5 I have on my phone.\nThis tablet has two speakers both on the back of the tablet and have decent volume. The Fusion5 108 matching case has slots for the speakers so they don't get drowned out by having it in the case plus openings for the cameras and all ports and buttons. I would prefer the speakers forward facing, something few tablet manufacturers do and there certainly seems to have room around the display bezel to incorporate front loaded speakers.\nBluetooth works fine with my wireless headphones. I haven't yet tried the HDMI port yet but I've got a four day Labor Day holiday break starting tomorrow and I'm anxious to see how well the HDMI output looks on my 50\" UHD 4k TV. Play store downloads are fast on my home wifi , Youtube videos also start very quick, only a few videos I've watched have had any buffering delay, even then it's just a slight pause. It has the standard Android web browser and Google Chrome is pre-loaded.\nI downloaded and ran AnTuTu bench marking software and the tablet scored around 25,000 on the test.\nOverall, I think this is a very good tablet for the money, I would love to have had the option to choose a Fusion5 108 with a Retina type display, having said that, the 1366  x 768 is a very nice display with no stuck pixels and quite sharp edge to edge."}

Anyway, I was planning on getting either BT speakers or similar, so it isn't all that much of an issue.  I am happy with the primary function of the tablet, i.e. (video, streaming, picture quality, storage etc.)."}

It also as a micro USB as well as USB and comes with a separate charging cord for charging it faster.\nThe only thing I didn't like was the camera's low quality but it's a tablet not a camera, so it doesn't really bug me.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01865QFJA", "review": "My needs from an Android tablet weren't elaborate to begin with, so my positive review may not be valuable to some. Basically, I wanted something I could do simple web and communication stuff with, that would run Lollipop or better (with updates permitted) without being slow to boot, wake, switch apps, etc. and without having to recharge frequently. This does all that, with additional benefit of being a larger screen than I needed, but lightweight enough that the size isn't awkward.\n\nThat light weight, and the plastic case, might work together to give some people a feeling that the device is flimsy. I can, unfortunately, testify that it's actually very sturdy because I drove off the other morning with it resting on the roof of my car, from which it naturally flew off. A stranger, out walking his dog not too far from my home, found it with the back plate popped off, the buttons missing and the display apparently extensively scratched. But he snapped the plate back on, operated the side switches with a screwdriver, and found my info to contact me and return it. All the front scratching happened to the screen protector film that the manufacturer kindly included; when I peeled it back the display itself is still perfect. So the only damage is a bit of scuffing around the edges of the back plate -- and the loss of the buttons, which I'm thinking of taking up a s 3-D printing project. Otherwise, the device still works as well as ever.\n\nThe only criticism I might make of the plastic case is that I really don't like the super-polished finish. It just begs for fingerprints and other smudges (and, for that matter, scuffing) and is a style that looked unnecessarily cheap when it first appeared maybe a decade ago and now looks unnecessarily dated. It's not worth turning down what is otherwise a great product, especially for the price, but the manufacturer might consider something matte.\n\nThe included pin-port charger is an awkward cube shape, into which the plug tines won't retract or fold (though they can be popped off because they are one of a set included for different outlet standards) so both carrying it around and storing it aren't as easy as might be hoped. But since the device can also be charged by any standard USB charger, that's a minor critique too."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B01865QFJA", "review": "Good for the price but flawed. As others have noted the touch screen is not responsive to the same level of quality as every other tablet I have owned. If was writing this review on this tablet, it would look like this - \"I was witin tis reviw on thi tabet, it wod lok lik ths\" because sometimes you have to press a couple of times to get it to recognize a press.\n\nI agree with other reviewers that say the screen is bright, big and beautiful. Clash of Clans runs fine on it, but Hearthstone is unplayable. The screen lag when even 4 cards are on screen is maddening. Battery life is short.\n\nIf you want this this to watch movies and browse content it's great, if you want to type anything or play more demanding games - not so much."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01865QFJA", "review": "I have had this tablet for 1 week and have found it easy to set up with many nice features.  My family has several tablets including an Asus and a Samsung Pro.  This 10.1 Fusion5 104 competes nicely with either of these.  The feature that I wanted most was the hdmi port, so that I could watch Amazon Prime Videos from my tablet to my TV.  After purchasing the appropriate mini hdmi cord from Amazon, I can enjoy my downloaded movies even if I am in the RV and without internet service.  The speakers are typical for a tablet, but with headphones the sound is excellent.  I have tested Netflix and YouTube and all works well.  I inserted a 32 gb sd micro card with pictures from my camera that were transferred from my computer. This worked nicely viewing my pictures on a larger screen.  The slideshow option is great.  This tablet does not have an external \"home\" key, but so far, that has not been a problem.\n So far, I have no complaints.  I enjoy the larger screen, movies are vivid and clear,  and I can increase the font size for reading.  This Fusion5 tablet can do everything the other tablets can do, plus send movies and pictures for viewing to a large TV."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01865QFJA", "review": "I write this evaluation with the disclaimer that I am new to the tablet world.\nI spent hours reviewing tablets and considering exactly what I wanted the tablet to do.  The primary function was to replace my laptop on travels to and from 2 different residences on the weekend.  I was looking for a unit that had ample viewing area (i.e. screen size for older, used eyes), sufficient memory (upgrade to more storage space), internet access in the form of pairing with my Galaxy phone (my internet source for the second residence), size and price.  The options available are overwhelming and the reviews are plentiful enough to give one a sense that the options available far exceeded my needs.\nI chose the FUSION5 based on the screen size, processor, and overall appearance.  The last and certainly not the least of my considerations was the cost.  It is a parallel support instrument for travels and convenience, not a work horse and this final consideration drove my purchase of the tablet.\nFirst and foremost, the quality is exceptional.  The screen is of ample size and clarity.  The ease of use (at the time of this review) in navigating the system has not been overly challenging.  Time and use will determine how the unit truly rises too or falls away from the intended use.  That being said, I am quite happy with the form and function, the cost, appearance and size.\nMy first tablet so far as left a good impression."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B01865QFJA", "review": "Unfortunately I'll have to give it a three star rating. It is a fast tablet and I wouldn't have any issues but once I took the screen protector off, after noticing a small dot, it seems that there is possibly a dead pixel. While viewing movies is great I notice this spot on shows that either have a white background or while I'm typing, like this review. It is kinda an eye sore especially for someone who enjoyed watching a show like Family Guy or other or typing. I like the fact that this company does make it possible to use an external hard drive especially if you have a lot of movies etc. to watch or listen to. They give you quite a bit for the price and a few adapters to boot! I would definitely recommend this tablet and as time goes by I'll update my review if anything comes up, but I can't give it a five star due to that annoying spot. Oh, as for games, I don't play any so I am figuring due to the fast processor and 2 GB memory that most will do fine."}

And I'm kind of jealous. When it came I should have handed him my other tablet and kept this one but it made me feel like I was taking something from him that was his to begin with. Anyway, he couldn't be more pleased with it. He watches Netflik and Amazon movies each day while recuperating from an operation, and it really helps with the boredom. It came on time as promised as well. Thank you seller for this wonderful device! And the price couldn't be better when comparing it to other tablets of the same size."}

I was swayed by the large 10.6\" size, the fast processing and ram, that it had the latest version of Android Lollipop, and most of all the dual cameras were 5mp and 2mp - much better than similar products.  It was on back-order when I ordered but I was so set that my decision to purchase it was the right one, I waited.  I was not disappointed!  It came the first day it was expected.  I was contacted by customer service letting me know to not be hesitant to contact them if I had any issues or questions.  We just brought this with us on 18 hour road trip - the large screen made it easier to navigate using maps, etc.  That brings me to the only thing I wish the tablet had that it does not - GPS.  I didn't realize how much GPS would matter until bringing it with me cross country.  While using maps worked using google and pinging, lack of GPS meant no real time location visuals.  Still, I love this tablet.  So much so that I have just ordered a second one since my husband refused to give it back to me after using it on our trip."}

When I first received this tablet, I found the shipping bags of air that's supposed to keep the tablet safe were all popped. I was concerned whether or not the tablet is fine or if something was detached inside the tablet. It was fine, but the tablet screen tends to flicker at a low brightness setting and makes a snapping noise everytime I turned it on. The percentage of battery also reverts to 100% instead of the actual percentage. I have to guess if the tablet is at low battery or not. The sound isn't great, neither is the camera, but I really don't care about that anyway. I use headphones all the time with my devices since I'm a private person :P.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01865QFJA", "review": "I absolutely LOVE this tablet. The screen is large and clear, and extremely bright. I previously had a cheap-o Polaroid Android tablet that I bought here on Amazon, but I had to return it because it wouldn't properly charge the battery. It would only add about 1% to the battery charge per hour, so that made it useless. Upon returning the Polaroid, I started shopping for another tablet. One of the problems I had with the Polaroid $70 tablet was that the screen was not very bright. I go to kidney dialysis three days a week, five hours a day, in a very brightly lit dialysis center, so having a screen that is bright and can cut through the glare from the fluorescent overhead lights was critical.\n\nThere are a bunch of no-name tablets out there at cheap prices, but in reading about \"brands\" when it comes to tablets, Fusion5 kept coming up over and over again. So I narrowed down my choices and the Fusion5 108 Octa Core tablet just kept coming up on the top of my list, over and over again. Despite there being cheaper alternatives, I paid the slightly higher price and jumped in with both feet. I'm sure glad I did.\n\nThe tablet absolutely DELIVERS when it comes to the display: crisp, bright, bold, sharp and very, very easy on my eyes. Plus it boots up very quickly as compared to the Polaroid tablet (probably 3-4X faster to get from power off to the desktop). In addition, the latest version of the Google Play Store was already installed, which WASN'T true with the Polaroid tablet. I had to jump through about 45 minutes worth of hoops to get the new version of Google Play installed on the Polaroid tablet before I could use the Google Play Store, because it would crash every time otherwise. With the Fusion5, Google Play's latest version was installed and ready to go -- so no messing around with downloading the APK and installing the new version.\n\nThis Fusion5 tablet feels really good in my hands. It is a little heavy, but not overly so, and I've ordered a nice tablet folio cover/stand to use it for viewing on my lap while in the dialysis chair. That will make things work nicely, but be warned: because this tablet is a 10.6\" wide-screen tablet, I didn't find a lot of choices for folio covers. A sleeve is not what I wanted, I needed something that would work as a stand as well. Many choices in an inexpensive universal folio cover/stand for 10.1\" tablets but very few for 10.6\" tablets like this one.\n\nFinally, my one major criticism: the micro SD card slot is a total pain to use. It is hidden behind a removable \"door\" and it requires that the person inserting or removing the micro SD card have some fingernails. The access area is so tiny and so constricted, I had to use a magnifying glass to determine exactly how to insert the micro SD card that I have (a 64 GB SanDisk micro SD). I was able to have my daughter insert the micro SD card for me. This was going to be a problem for me, because I store a lot of things on the micro SD by putting it into my laptop then inserting it into the tablet. In and out on a regular basis wouldn't work well because of how this device has the micro SD port physically configured. Instead, because this tablet has a regular-sized USB port, I went ahead and got a 64GB thumb drive... that makes it easy to transfer stuff to and from my laptop and the tablet. Now I just leave the micro SD card in place.\n\nI would definitely recommend the 10.6\" Fusion5 108 Octa Core Android tablet."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01865QFJA", "review": "When looking for a tablet I use some version of this mental equation, Buy if Price + Features meets your needs. This tablet definitely met my features and price requirements. I love the 2GB ram. My main use is to watch videos and browse web pages. For the price, you can't beat the speed of the processors and the hardware it comes with. I highly recommend it. I've bought $800+ fully loaded iPads before and this thing beats them hands down.\nIt's a little rough around the edges though. The basic Android battery meter was not showing the correct battery levels initially so I had to reset it manually by discharging and charging the unit a couple of times. The volume and screen contrast levels are a little weak. The speaker holes are rear facing so for optimum sound you need a stand that doesn't block its backside.\nThe charging plug is a small cylindrical plug (not a micro USB) and the AC adapter is a one piece unit so if it fails I would have to go looking for this special AC adapter. I wish the cable for the power plug came with a standard USB on one end and their round plug on the other. That would make it very easy to swap adapters. I'm not criticizing the choice of the round plug, in fact I think it's better than the micro USB charging ports because they tend to get loose or sometimes get totally destroyed by frequent use. This has happened to me on a cell phone and another Android tablet in the past and there is almost no way to fix that problem but to replace the unit entirely when the micro USB receptacle gets mangled.\nWith a full charge, it seems to stream videos for well over 4-5 hours continuously.\nEvery once in a while the tablet freezes or needs a reboot. I'm not sure if it's Android or the tablet.\nHowever, in spite of the rough edges, I think it's still a pretty good deal at $149 delivered. I don't really need to worry about it being dropped kicked, stolen, immersed in soda, abused by kids, etc. I'll just get another one and I'm pretty sure the newer versions will have some of the rough edges smoothed out. I've found over time that generally people tend to baby expensive electronics and limit their use of it in fear of it getting damaged or lost. So it's nice to have a tablet that performs well but you didn't shell out so much money for it that you don't hesitate to use it as much as possible for your own convenience.

The picture quality is amazing, and the sound is loud enough that I can watch a movie without needing to plug in headphones to hear.  Totally happy with this tablet."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01865QFJA", "review": "This is my fourth tablet and last two were a major brand.  I got this one because my two year old big brand froze.  The Fusion5 was selected because of its great high end specifications - the ram, unusual compliment of ports, and Android 5.1.  This was the only device that seemed to have it all without spending multiples of the Fusion price.  We all understand that specifications do not tell the whole story.  You have to hold in your hand and turn it on to know if it will truly work as described.  I was not disappointed. This tablet is has a quality feel, and the performance is superb.  Combined with the performance I liked the basic Android 5.1 operating system without the huge load of trash apps that I have to deactivate on the major brand devices.  This is NOT a \"cheap\" tablet - it is a quality tablet that is value priced.  Do take care if you insert an SD card.  Slide it in slowly and do not go beyond \"finger nail\" deep."}

So the built-in 16 g fills up very fast.\n\nThe WiFi and blue tooth work very well.\nMusic and videos play fine.\n\nSo if you can get past the OS and the flickering screen it's not a bad tablet.\n\nWith the fast help from Fusion.

I usually have to reboot the device to pick up WIFI until it drops again.\nThe SD card slot will let the card slide up enough that the Tablet can not read it. (It seems the slot is just under the plastic cover enough that it is hard to push the card in enough to lock it down.  I am still using a 128 gig card, loaded with movies, documents and music.\nThere is no OTA update for 6.0.  I have emailed customer support asking about it.  So I have to remove apps to install others (16 gig fills up very fast).\nThe GPS will not pick up location unless the WIFI is enabled with it.\nI do not use the camera (reads the specs. to see why).  I usually use my phone and edit the photos on the Tablet or my laptop.\nOtherwise this has been a nice tablet.\n\nUPDATE....7/3/17\n\nI read in the reviews that if you contact customer support you can get the files to update to Android 6.0 Marshmallow.\n\nI first checked the website and both the support and download links on the site.  There was nothing.\nWell I did email them....\n\nOn Sunday, July 2, 2017 at 4:45 PM, billyk wrote:\n\n> Name: BillyK\n> Email:\n> Telephone:\n> Comment: I bought a 10.6'' Fusion5 108 Octa Core Android 5.1 Lollipop Tablet PC - 2GB RAM, 16GB Storage 2MP and 5MP Camera with AutoFocus, Android Tablet PC and I would like to know how I can upgrade it to Android 6.0 Marshmallow.\n> When I check update, there is none.\n\nHi,\n\nThank you for your email update.\n\nWe believe the update for your model has not yet been released.\n\nIf we have any update it should notify you.\n\nAlso, we shall get any updates from our team.\n\nWe will be happy to provide you.\n\nWe appreciate your patience and cooperation.\nRegards,\nMike\nFusion5\n\nSo I am dropping a STAR for this....."}

My old tablet was driving me crazy with lags in performance, and the more apps I installed, the more lags I'd have to contend with. The Fusion5 has all but eliminated the lags. I haven't installed a lot of apps on it so far, but each app I've installed so far hasn't caused a slow-down. I haven't added extra memory yet, so it's doing well on the internal 16 gb. Can't say how it works hooking it up with the TV since I've yet to do that, but the resolution of the tablet's screen is a fine resolution without any distortion while viewing it at an angle. I'll have to say I'm impressed with this tablet. If I encounter any issues with it, I'll report back here.\n\n6-28-2016:\nOne thing I noticed is that when I added a Micro SD card to bump up the memory, I don't have an option to move installed apps to the extra memory. In my other Android devices, there's a button that you can tap in the Apps section in Settings to move apps to the SD card, but this device doesn't have that button. So you can store data on an SD, but not apps. This is not a deal breaker for me because the internal 16 GB of memory is enough for me for installing apps, but it might be for some people."}

Spend a lot of time tapping the screen before it finally acknowledges that I want it to do something.  It was shipped super-fast but it also came 3/4 of the way charged, so I think this was a gently used tablet.  And it froze on me after about an hour.  That was annoying.  For a first time tablet user, this would be great; I do recommend.  Even using it as a bridge from one great tablet to another higher quality one is not a bad deal. For children, also a good idea.

The screen is not AWESOME, but it is more than adequate. I enjoy using my Fusion5 104 very much. (To people who say \"Get a Samsung: I've had 2 Samsung tablets and two phones, and I am NOT impressed.)\n\nI am a fairly heavy user and I have to say, the battery life has been surprisingly good. I can use the tablet most all day without it going flat. It is fairly slow to charge but also slow to discharge, so that's a wash.\n\nAs to reviewers who complain about customer service: I had a couple or three issues while setting up, and each of my questions was answered within just a few minutes.  !!!  One problem I had was that the screen calibration was a bit off. I emailed Fusion through the Amazon Marketplace and \"Lillian\" responded almost immediately and said to do a factory reset to solve this. I did, and now the screen is dead on. WooHoo!\n\nMy only real complaint is not with the tablet but with the Fusion5 branded leather look protective case. When I inserted the tablet into the case so that 1) the camera lenses match the case holes, and 2) the case opens book style (right to left) as I think it should, and even 3) the buttons and jacks are accessible, then the buttons and jacks are on the bottom of the tablet rather than on top as I would expect them to be. I'm getting used to that and it hasn't been a problem in the past couple of weeks.\n\nOh and one other thing... The device info on Amazon says the tablet has two USB ports. Mine has only one. Don't know if this is a newer model or what, but I was a little disappointed. Haven't needed two ports yet, but one never knows, does one? I do like the USB dongle that came in the box. I've used it with a couple of my thumb drives with good results.\n\nOverall, I'd buy this Fusion5 104 tablet again for the same money."}

Applications launch quickly.  I have an older Android device and when I ran lollipop 5.1 on it, it slowed down to a crawl.  So far this one works great.  It is light and has a good screen for this price range.  My daughter uses this for school and it works great for her.  It really helped her when I hooked up a Bluetooth keyboard. The case is plastic so I would recommend buying a external case to protect it.  Make sure you get the right one.  I got one that did not fit perfectly.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01865QFJA", "review": "I love this tablet.  It is so much better than my previous tablet in almost every aspect.\n\nFirst of all, it's big, 10 inches.  My previous tablet was only 7 inches. Some of you may think that it's only 3 inches different, but\nwhen it comes down to square inches, it's practically twice the size (32 inches squared vs 73 inches squared).\n\nSecondly, there's the speed.  The Fusion5 108 has 8 cores and is 1.8Ghz.  So far, I haven't had any lag.  I can have several apps running and play games with no problems.\n\nThird, is the RAM.  Most tablets have only 1GB of RAM, but this tablet has 2 GB, which makes a huge difference.\n\nFourth are the cameras, 2 megapixels and 5 megapixels.  They are adequate quality, but I wouldn't bother taking any family photos with them.\n\nThe battery is 7200 mah, which should last you about 5-6 hours of gaming.\n\nI haven't had a chance to try the HDMI yet.\n\nThe bluetooth and wifi work just fine.  For the record, it doesn't have GPS.\n\nThe touch sensitivity is...good.  There are times when I have to tap on the screen twice, but I think I can get used to it.\n\nThis is the case that I got for it:\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Fintie-Dragon-Touch-KingPad-K100/dp/B013WC6TL6/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1463891236&sr=8-2&keywords=kingpad+k100\n\nThe Kingpad K100 has the same dimensions as the Fusion5 108, so it fits fine, but it's NOT prefect.  The case covers the speakers.\n\nAnother problem are speakers.  They're not very loud and average quality.  Plus, they're on the back of the tablet, so they're being directed away from you.\n\nOverall, I'm very satisfied with this tablet and I would definitely recommend it to my friends.\n\nPS: one thing that I am concerned about is the battery life.  My previous tablet only lasted about 5 months before it stopped charging and I had to send it in 3 times before the warranty expired.  I'll post an update for this in 6 months.\n\nThis product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.\n\nUpdate 09-13-16:  Well, like my previous tablet ASUS ME170CX, this Fusion5 tablet stopped charging.  Don't get me wrong, I love this tablet, it's great.  However, I had to send it back in to get it replaced or repaired.  I'm waiting to hear back from them."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01865QFJA", "review": "This tablet was a very easy setup. I had the option of manually installing everything or loading a backup from my phone. I loaded from the backup and then just deleted what I didn't want on the tablet, changed a few settings like moving it from UK to US so the Kindle app would recognize me. Everything just works. It has a fantastic display that is crisp and bright and big enough to really see the word and excel files for work. It's great for movies, web, email, work, play. It has 16 gb of storage and an expandable memory slot so space isn't an issue at all. WIFI works well with my home and work networks. I can watch Netflix or listen to Pandora without issue. I use bluetooth headphones and bluetooth speakers with it and they have worked perfectly. This tablet does everything I want it to do, it does it fast and so far with no hiccups at all. It has a solid feel to it and a great price. I would highly recommend this tablet to anyone looking for a quality tablet at an affordable price. This product was provided at a discounted price in order to allow me to test it for consumer evaluation and submit an honest review."}

Google Drive only works if you download maps for the area ahead of time while connected to WiFi, and the maps expire in 29 days.  Downloaded maps include an area from about Philadelphia to Richmond.  You must download maps without gaps between maps, or driving directions won't work.  Apparently the apps are intended for smartphones, which are constantly online via cell phone towers.  Also downloading can't be done with slow\nWiFi, as in most motels, so download your maps before beginning a trip.  Traffic information is available only while online.

I didn't won't to spend that kind of money again so I thought I would take a chance and try the Fusion5. What a surprise I got in this tablet. The unit is a power house for not that much money, 32GB and 5.1 OS, unheard of at this price. I have been using for three weeks and I haven't found anything bad to say. I know all the different Android OS give you different displays on your devices, so I was not surprised how some of the different web sites were displayed.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01865QFJA", "review": "As a software developer and I/T specialist for over 20 years, this is actually my first tablet purchase, and I selected this particular unit based primarily on other Amazon reviewers.  I've been using this in a casual manner daily for the last month, and have not had a single technical issue.  My primary use for this is streaming video, so I was very happy to see that Netflix and Amazon Video were working well after a couple of app downloads and within a few minutes.  The wireless connections are stable, video content streams without interruption, and web browsing performance is very acceptable.\n\nInitially, I thought I had a hardware issue with the headphone jack as none of my headphones would fully seat all the way into the jack.  I was one step away from calling support, when I decided to push my luck and really make an effort to make the headphones seat all the way in.  Sure enough, with just a little more pushing, the headphones snapped into place with a satisfying \"click\".  I've never used a device where it took that extra bit of effort to seat the headphones, but I can say I love that!  I have had the jack loosen and wear on too many other devices, and I feel this unit is rock solid in that regard.\n\nFrom a performance standpoint, this tablet has met my expectations.  I really had a concern about buying a tablet with only 1GB RAM given that my primary purpose is watching movies, but that hasn't been a problem at all, and the CPU specifications seem to fit well with my typical usage.  I do notice some activities / apps seem a little more sluggish than what I am used to on a laptop or PC, but that is to be expected.  Battery consumption on this device seems to be really hit and miss.  I can watch 1-2 hours of video and not really take a hit, but letting the laptop sit idle or 1/2 hour of internet browsing can suck the battery life.  Not sure if background/system activity is the primary drain, but I feel like I need this plugged in more often than I should based on my usage and past experience with other battery-reliant devices.  The charging speed on this unit seems a little slower than I would expect, even though I have a dedicated \"smart\" USB 4A-capable charging outlet.\n\nEven though this is a non-US based company, the fact that they have a service presence in the US gave me piece of mind that if something was wrong, I wouldn't have to deal with international considerations getting it resolved.  That played a significant part in my purchase as well.\n\nI have used laptops for the last 15 years for my personal and business needs.  I'm not sure that this tablet (or any other, for that matter), could ever replace my laptop based on my current usage.  However, this device is an excellent, portable complement to my laptop without lugging around the weight of a laptop.  I did purchase an additional micro-SD 64GB storage disk that allows me to store quite a bit of media files for this tablet, and that has been working out great, minimizing the reliance on the laptop. I prefer to leave the internal 32GB to the operating system and app installations as much as possible, so the additional 64GB \"external\" storage is helpful.\n\nIt was a little challenging finding a tablet with these specifications at this price point and a good reputation, so after a month's worth of use, I came out ahead on this purchase. This is the first tablet I would recommend to friends and family."}

Within weeks they began slowing down to a crawl. Took several minutes to boot up. Simple apps [Solitaire, Mahjong, etc.] would stop working in the middle of a game and the device would shut down and reboot. I returned 2 of the tablets. I tried keeping the last one [16gb] however, 5 days after the 30-day return window closed, the device stopped charging. It is completely dead. Fusion5 claims a 12-month warranty. The problem is I cannot find anyway to contact them to return the device and get a refund.\n\nBottom line? Stay away from Fusion5\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW: A Beautiful and Fast Tablet\n\nReceived the Fusion5 104 a few days ago. Found it very easy to set up WiFi, email and install my favorite apps. The screen is beautiful with great color and resolution. The system is fast despite my loading the device up with over 70 apps - for games, videos, utilities and productivity. The most important additional features for me in this model are the 5g WiFi and the ability to add an extra 32gb memory card. Overall this is a fabulous tablet with an excellent price. I highly recommend it to all. PS.  I need to make it clear that this review is for the Fusion5 104 model (black). I also purchased the lower cost version (white) a few weeks ago. It is not in the same league as this model. Lower resolution, camera quality and the 16gb does not give much room for photos, videos, etc. However, it's a good choice for kids.  I recommend paying the extra $20 bucks for the Fusion5 104. I am very happy with my purchase."}

Its fine watching movies and everything.\nDont expect much from the cameras and you shouldnt from a tablet.\nAntut test was about 31,000, amazon fire tablet is around 24,000 so its a little more powerful then that.\nwifi seems to be ok. I don't know why there is a second lag when hitting the power button to awake the screen and put it to sleep.\nI still have more testing to do.

I consider myself a fairly high tech person - I make my living with computers, and I have even worked a bit on coding apps for Android.  I cannot complain about this tablet.  It has some shortcomings, but with a price of under $150 they can be overlooked.  The tablet just works. It is fast, and it is up to date.  I have watched Netflix on it, as well as installed and ran several games.  It seems I have access to everything on the Android marketplace.  WIFI works well with both my home and work wireless, Bluetooth connection to my Bluetooth headphones worked flawlessly.  The speakers do sound a bit flat, as well as not being terribly loud, but use some headphones and the problem is fixed. Battery life has lasted for an hour or two I was off the charger, which is about the maximum I used the tablet in a sitting.\n\nBuild is good.  The shell is plastic, but but the tablet feels good in the hand. I am not sure it would take a lot of abuse, but an adult who does not mistreat it should not have any issues. All buttons are on one of the short edges, with the front and read cameras being on the same end of the tablet.  Both cameras are near one corner, so you should not have any issues with placing your had over the cameras.\n\nThe tablet is supplied with an OTG (On The Go) cable which will allow you to hook up USB thumb drives and other USB  devices up to the tablet. When this cable is in use you cannot charge the tablet as the same slot is used for both.  It is nice they supply the OTG cable with the tablet.\n\nAt under $150 this tablet is jam packed full of power and features I did not think were available at this price."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01865QFJA", "review": "I really wanted to love this tablet. It's wonderfully done. But the one Fatal Flaw is that it's impossible to insert the SD Card into the slot. And then, if you do, it can NEVER be taken out again. If using SD storage is important to you, then this tablet is off limits. Also, the web site listing states:  \" Further storage can also be added via a micro SD card (Supports upto a 128-gb TF-card) (not included).\"  But the protective screen cover on the tablet clearly says \"32 GB\" only. So it's highly limited and then you can't change the card once it's inserted. Such a shame. It's a wonderful tablet otherwise. For someone who works online all the time, this is not a factor. But for me, who plays recorded movies a lot, it's a deal breaker. It's too bad the web listing LIED . . .  How could the manufacturer include such a horrible SD slot???  I purchased an eyeglass screwdriver to seat the SD card . . . It was long enough, but I still couldn't get the card to be seated and recognized.\nAnd . . . Oh yes, I'm a computer techie and still couldn't figure it out!\n\nOne More Thing:  The power adapter has a tiny round connection. Looks like a toy thing. If the flimsy connector breaks (only a matter of time), you can't just use a standard micro usb cable. You'll spend weeks trying to order a new power adapter. I don't think you can just replace the cable. You need to get the whole adapter with cable attached."}
