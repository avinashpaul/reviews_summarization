{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B009W9BQMQ", "review": "The 8in Apple iPad Mini was eagerly anticipated, but the new 10in iPad 4 (or iPad with Retina Display as Apple insists on calling it) is a surprise as it arrives only nine months after its predecessor the iPad 3.\n\nExternally, the iPad 4 looks and feels identical to its predecessor. Although it is sturdy and slim, it's still the same weight at around 650g. I had hoped for a reduction in weight since the iPad 3 was around 50g heavier than the iPad 2. The battery lasted 12 hours when I was playing videos matching the time achieved by the smaller iPad Mini.\n\nThe 10in screen still has the same 2,048x1,536 pixel resolution. It's very sharp and bright with exceptional image quality, especially when compared to lower resolution tablets like the iPad Mini. Only the upcoming Samsung Nexus 10 Android tablet will have a display potentially capable of matching it.\n\nAll the changes are on the inside rather than the outside. The A6X dual-core processor is twice as fast as the iPad 3's A5X chip, but this will make little real difference until apps are designed to take advantage of it. Apple will doubtless release features in future versions of iOS that will only run on the A6X, but that has yet to happen. The iPad 4 is thankfully compatible with the recently launched EE LTE network.\n\nHD Facetime\nI was pleased with Video chatting and that the front-facing camera now records in 720p resolution which gave better, more accurate-looking video although the speed of my broadband connection did also affect image quality.\n\nThe iPad 4 may be a modest upgrade over its predecessor but it's still the best 10in tablet so far, which says just as much about the competition as it does about Apple's tablet. It's still relatively heavy though, so lighter tablets such as the iPad Mini will be a better buy for some.\n\n Here are the Tech Specs for those who don't know----\n\nHardware:\nHeight 9.5 inches\nWidth 7.31 inches\nThickness 0.37 inches\nWeight 1.44 pounds\nColor Silver / Black, Silver / White\nSpeakers Mono\n\nDisplay:\nScreen size (diagonal) 9.7 inches\nTechnology IPS LCD\nResolution (X) 2048 px\nResolution (Y) 1536 px\nPPI 264\nTouchscreen type Capacitive\nMultitouch Yes\n\nSoftware:\nOperating system iOS\nLaunch OS version 6\nMedia streaming AirPlay\n\nProcessor:\nCPU brand Apple\nCPU model A6X\nClock speed 1.4 GHz\nCores 2\n\nMemory:\nRAM size 1 GB\n\nStorage:\nInternal size 64 GB, 32 GB, 16 GB\n\nConnectivity:\nWi-Fi Yes\nWi-Fi support 802.11n, 802.11g, 802.11b, 802.11a\n802.11n frequencies 5GHz, 2.4GHz\nBluetooth Yes\nBluetooth version 4.0\n\nFront Camera:\nEffective pixels 1.2 megapixels\nVideo resolution 720p\nVideo framerate 30\n\nRear Camera:\nEffective pixels 5 megapixels\nFocus type Autofocus\nVideo resolution 1080p\nVideo framerate 30\n\nPorts:\nVideo out Yes\nHeadphone 3.5mm\nData connections Lightning\n\nSensors:\nSensors Ambient Light, Gyroscope, Accelerometer\n\nBattery:\nCapacity 42.5 Wh\nRemovable No\nQuoted use time 10 hr\n\nThis is the best tablet out there so far!!

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B009W9BQMQ", "review": "What can I say...great product. I'm not a very techie person but the iPad is user friendly, light, and has a great battery life. The display is crystal clear. I did have to update the software when it arrived because the camera and photo app would not work. I was ready to go the Apple store for them to trouble shoot it but my friend figured it out first."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B009W9BQMQ", "review": "Honestly, I had been trying to figure out what an iPad4 was. Well, this is essentially an iPad3 with a few improvements that I really like.\nI already own an iPad2, but decided to upgrade to this because I needed to bump up to 32GB.  That, and a deal on this iPad which was incredible convinced me to upgrade now. I still use my MacAir and my Dell laptops, but the iPad is my daily go to device and where I go an iPad is going. Great battery life and minimal problems make this a much loved convenience.\nThe improvements are not overwhelming, but the truth is I already love the iPad and this makes it better. I've always thought the screen image was very good, but this is an obvious step up. It is clear, bright and vivid with the improved retina display.\nThe iSight camera at five megapixels is very good, but I wasn't complaining about the pictures I took with my old iPad. Still, it is a nice improvement and it takes a much clearer picture than my old iPhone.\nThe new processor is really fast. I didn't think it was slow before but when I have a lot of apps running I've noticed that it is faster. You'll have to trust me on this one. I tend to run a lot of stuff at the same time and the old iPad was slower, but not to the extent that I found it irritating or irksome.\nI like the new lightening connector which is an 8 wire adapter. Just me, but it seems less clunky. However, if you have a lot of Apple products that use the old 30 wire adapter, this may be a pain. I'm going to have to get another car charger/wall charger and I'll have to take two chargers to cover both adapter types when I hit the road.\nAnother thing I like is my personal secretary Siri. Depress the screen button and Siri is ready to roll. It is voice interpretive intuitive software that retrieves information. While this will probably seem like rudimentary artificial intelligence in a few years, I get a total kick out of it. It's nice to get directions or find out where the Sox are playing or get the earliest showing of a movie. Love it, though I am still playing around with it and probably haven't scratched the surface yet. I don't know if there is any truth to this, but I've heard that the Suri software may be available for the earlier versions of iPad at a later date.\nAs for the size and weight, minimally larger but I'd be hard pressed to say this except I compared the specs.\nHere is the thing. If you don't care about a better camera or a better display or a faster processing speed or having your own cyber slave to talk to, go with the less expensive iPad2.\nI like Apple products. I have been using the iPad for two years now and it is fairly trouble free. The few problems I've had were the result of software upgrades. I am absolutely no techie type, but the problems have all been fixed with minimal grief.\nThis product is getting 4* because the differences between this iPad and its predecessor are slight when you look at the overall big picture. This takes a great product and kicks it up a notch or two, but it hasn't reinvented or reimagined the iPad.\nUpdate: I am liking this better each day. The updated processor is nice but this also seems a bit more intuitive if it can possibly be so.\nThe imaging is incredible and the pictures this takes are amazing in their clarity and level of detail.\nI found that my pricey Joby stand case, which was supposedly made to fit with my iPad 2 works with the new iPad despite very slightly different dimensions. I'm delighted that it doesn't have to be tossed.\nThe only problem I've encountered thus far was an upgrade to the software. This is Apple's problem since it screwed up our other iPads with the same problems, most notably with mail. There is a fix that I found on an Apple forum.\nLove this, but it is still a 4* considering everything."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B009W9BQMQ", "review": "If you're still curious about whether an IPad is right for you.. you could probably do best going to all the reviews from the IPad 2 or 3.  Here I am going to talk about what 'new' features you see in the IPad 4 (also called the 'new' IPad).\n\nFirst off.. they don't make the IPad 3 anymore.. when this was created it was immediately a replacement for the IPad 3.  There wasn't a lot of fanfare as this wasn't a huge upgrade over the 3 and was just released with the new IPad Mini.\n\nThe two main features (for those in the US):\n- Retina display.. I never thought the display was bad, but this is an improvement.  Compared next to the original IPad 3 there is a difference, albeit not overly noticeable unless you get an app that was made for the retina display (not many out there yet as the product isn't even 30 days old yet).  The glare issue is still there.  If you're using this outside it's basically like looking in the mirror if the sun is at a bad angle. Nothing changed on that front.\n- Faster speed. Same as above I never thought it was an issue but when using some speed tests it is faster and you'll notice, especially when multitasking, the apps run smoother with less 'hitches'.\n\nAlso:\n- Like the IPad Mini and the new phone it has the 8-pin adapter and not the 'old' 30 pin insert.\n\nEverything else.. the exact same as the former IPad 3. Battery life is great and while I'm not a 'heavy' user of the IPad (mainly used for web surfing, basic apps, etc..) it fits all of my needs.  Overall, if you have the IPad 3 should you upgrade?  I don't see a major reason unless you're the type that HAS to have the latest and greatest.  I just happened to finally be in the market for one (after years of indifference) and with my roommate having the IPad 3 it was an easy comparison."}

Yea right! I still have first generation iPad - and that's what is excellent/good condition is! Just recently it started acting up.\nIs it worth it? I don't think so!!! Instead of keep buying refurbished ones to save $$$, it's better to put your money together for the real deal! It's not saving if I have to buy another one after only 6 months."}

It has performed like a champ, always connects quickly to wifi, is well constructed, and has shown no operational issues. I use it for general web browsing at home, but also take it on the road for musical performances. The screen is just the right size to display my song charts and fits on a music stand without being obtrusive like a laptop on stage. Early on in its lifetime It fell about 6 feet from a stage riser to a concrete floor. I had to have the cracked screen replaced locally, but the rest of the iPad survived and worked fine. I have no reason to replace it, but when I do it will likely be with another iPad. Awesome product!"}

The Ipad works wonderfully and feels new. My mom says it works faster than her phone and computer (this was an early Christmas present for her)."}

The iPad is a sleek device and is solidly built.  The retina screen is beautiful, and the size is, in my opinion, perfect for a tablet.  The mini is too small, and the Pro is just too big.\n\nWe have had no issues with the iPad, although the screen seems pretty susceptible to scratches.  My wife uses it mainly for games and web browsing, and it works well for that.  I have used it for a little more processor intensive uses with no hiccups.\n\nI rated it a 4/5 because of the screen being so easy to scratch and the overall weight.  I knew it wouldn't be as light as an iPad Air, but I was surprised at how heavy it actually was.  Overall this is a great tablet, and beats every other tablet I have owned or used."}

Maybe I'm the only one who got a defective iPad or perhaps all models are the same and people think it's normal; I don't know, but the crashing and restarting while I'm watching a video or reading something for class is annoying and inconvenient.  I can't even remember how many times I restored my iPad, but in only worked for a short amount of time when I had to restore it again.  At times when I connect the iPad to my iTunes, it showed that all my data on it was corrupted and I needed to restore it.  It's was annoying because I have over 8,000 songs I need to sync again and it takes a long time.  I am only now, after a couple years, selling this back to Amazon so I could get an iPad mini 4 to escape this problem.  I actually thought it was normal, at first, for the device to be crashing and restarting so much.  I thought, \"perhaps I'm just a demanding user.\"  No way; it needs to WORK."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B009W9BQMQ", "review": "This product is now 3 years old. It seemed like a good product until APPLE got involved. The product is tied to my APPLE ID. A few weeks ago, someone tried to login to apple using my email and because they didn't have the correct password, it locked out the apple account. The IPAD is linked to the APPLE account. The IPAD now has a ACCOUNT blocked screen that I can't get past. To unlock the ID, they require the original credit card number and expiration date PLUS the 3 digit code on the back of the card. We can come up with the old credit card number and make a good guess at the old expiration date BUT recall the 3 digit code on the back of a card from 2013??? What genius thought that would be a workable recovery process? The other option is to provide the original invoice. That seemed easy since it was purchased through AMAZON, but wait!  The response from Apple is they will not unlock the IPAD because the AMAZON invoice is not really the original invoice. APPLE does not recognize the AMAZON invoice as legitimate because apparently AMAZON is not an authorized APPLE dealer. They are a re-seller. Therefore their legal weasel words allow them to render this product useless. While APPLE makes good products, they have unworkable support."}

I prefer Apple products mainly because of their worry-free approach to computer security. I specifically did not want the next model up with the cell tower transceiver because of the added cost and reduced battery time. I have a cell phone for that. Also, the base 16Gb of RAM seems just fine thus far.  I purchased used with an advertised good condition, but as far as I can tell it is as good as new.

All the convenience of an iPad and cell data capability as well. I'm really pleased with my purchase. its an affordable alternative to taking my expensive laptop on an upcoming trip. The upgrade in capacity from my old 16G is a boon as well, as i can store more photos and data, even watch a movie if I want to..  I can use it stay in touch with family, even have video chats, and this iPad with Retina screen is an excellent reader as well, the screen is the perfect size for  reading e-books!\nI also use it to listen to music over apple's iHeart Radio, and keep track of my appointments and contacts. It synchs with my phone and laptop so that everything is always \"on the same page\" The OS comes with a suite of excellent software and there are so many helpful free apps at the Ap store that if one doesn't perfectly suit me, i just delete it and try something new.

I was shipped a refurbished iPad 4, which is what I wanted. The screen wasn't all the away sealed and was lifting a bit near the home button so I had to seal it myself with some Krazy Glue. Because of this, the home button wasn't level (rocks back and forth a bit). Even after I sealed it myself the home button is still not all the way flush to the screen. It's a small annoyance, but it works so I can't complain that much. Dust was found underneath the glass screen, not a lot, but it is noticeable when browsing the web. Overall quality is 3.5-4/5. It's 100% functional. Everything works. Fair quality device for the price paid, but definitely not great."}

I'd say it still supports 95%+ but the day is coming when it's going to be obsolete as my old 3GS iPhone did when it could not download the latest iOS and apps started not working because they no longer supported the old iOS.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B009W9BQMQ", "review": "The problems with this iPad had nothing to do with the company that shipped them.  I purchased a 32GB iPad, and it arrived the next day!  I was so excited, and began setting it up.  I plugged it into my computer, started up iTunes and started the set up process.  When I attempted to input information into the iPad, the touch screen would not react properly.  When I touch certain points on the screen, there was no reaction, or it would react like a stuck keyboard key, typing a letter multiple times.  I contacted the seller, and they tried to do a direct swap, but b/c it was an Apple product, and under warranty, I needed to return it before they could do anything.  I returned it, and a few days later a new iPad arrived.  I went through the same process, however, with the new iPad, the touch screen would not work at all.  This time, the company asked me to contact Apple, directly.  I contacted Apple, and they told me the product was no longer under warranty.  The told me that I could take it to one of their retail stores, but the cost to repair would be my responsibility.  When I contacted the company that sold it to me, they sent me proof that the iPad was covered under a one-year manufacturer's warranty.  I contacted Apple, again, and got the run-around.  Apple would not assist me in replacing the iPad, so the company that sold it to me, gave me a full refund, after I sent it back. My frustration/unhappiness is completely with Apple."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B009W9BQMQ", "review": "Apple customer service is HORRIBLE! Apple used to have decent customer service but now it's one of the worst. They don't give a damn about customers at all. Their only focus is to dig as much money out of your pockets as possible. This iPad has so many things wrong with it I could spend a day writing about it. When I go to apple stores it's ALWAYS a long wait. The last time it took FIVE hours. After that terrible experience they sent me a request for feedback. But they don't read what customers write. They don't even listen to customers who go though all of the trouble to go to one of their stores. Their survey requests are a joke and a waste of time. After EIGHT months of buying this horrible tablet it still doesn't work correctly.\n\nI also have an iPhone but when I took it to an Apple Store they had no clue how to fix it. Most of the problems were created by Apple  They deleted three ways to download photos and now I can't remove any photos from my phone unless I mail them 5 at a time to my laptop. And that causes all the photos attributes to be destroyed like the DATE & TIME the photos were taken. Apple doesn't even realize that by deleting all the dates and times of photos creates photos that are all scrambled. They kept telling me to increase my cloud storage. But uploading anything to iCloud DESTROYS the time and date of everything, like photos, videos and any file. The reason Apple deleted previous ways to transfer photos easily and with dates and times intact was to get people to buy larger iCloud storage. That's their motive. Money. All they want is to take as much money from people as possible and they use any means to gouge customers.\n\nTrying to get to anyone at Apple is EXTREMELY hard. They do know about firewalls since they have a massive firewall between customers and anyone at Apple. It's impossible to contact anyone in management at Apple. They isolate themselves from any accountability. They get paid fortunes for doing nothing except plot devious ways to gouge customers.\n\nApple is so conniving they sell sync cords for $22 when their cost to manufacture them is 3 cents. And even with a 'genuine' Apple sync cord I constantly get error messages saying the sync cord is not compatible with my device. They designed their devices to only accept Apple sync cords knowing that the cords last only a couple of months at the most. Using a sync cord is the only way to charge their devices but charging a device shouldn't require a sync cord. There should be a simple cable with a phono plug on the end and have a receptacle on the device solely for charging. As an electrical engineer I'm sickened by how Apple gouges millions of people by selling specially made sync cords when a cheap power cord is all a customer needs. Apple uses slaves to make their products to maximize their profits. They're not content with just getting an adequate profit. They have to abuse their workers (slaves) and customers. Only sociopaths could do what they do.\n\nNeedless to say I'm not buying anymore Apple products. The company has been going downhill for the past fifteen years. They're sitting on 60-75 billion dollars in cash but that's not enough. They want to continue to gouge people regardless of how many they harm.\n\nBtw, even wring this review took a long time because the screen is so sensitive that if your hand even gets close to it something weird happens. And trying to type takes forever because simply trying to put the cursor in the middle of text to edit it doesn't work 90% of the time.\n\nNo more money from me Apple! I don't trade with dishonest people who love hurting others intentionally."}

Called Amazon Customer Service to cancel the order and why, they were quick, professional and handled my cancellation promptly.\n\nI then started looking at other iPad's and was surprised to find for a few dollars more I could buy a newer version with a lot better and features. I quickly ordered the iPad Monday just before 6PM eastern time and received the iPad in original box, factory sealed, brand new with all needed parts to begin using it once I charged the battery. The AMAZING part besides the awesome iPad was I received it just after 3PM eastern time TWO DAYS after I ordered it without paying for expedited shipping. I was so excited I gave it to him that night with the other two items and he was so happy with his truly awesome gift. I'm so happy with this seller I'm going to buy myself one like it even though my current iPad 2nd generation is in excellent shape and has been my go-to everyday since I bought it 3 years and 1 month ago.

I wanted an inexpensive iPad with lots of memory and I was willing to pay less than $300.  It was impulsive, I didn't research it a whole lot but suddenly decided I needed something other than my macbook pro and iPhone 6, something with a touch screen that's big enough to read, for real.  Amazon, of course, came through with a variety of options, and I found the one that met my simple specifications (like new, at least 32 memory, 4th gen).\n\nIt arrived within the week (normal shipping from this seller).  It was packaged safely (but not fancy) and came with the power cord.  The iPad clearly had been kept in a case the whole time it was used because it was clean and had  no scratches or marks.  It worked immediately without any hiccups.  I am used to my phone charging fully within a couple of hours, but I need to charge the iPad overnight to bring up to 100% from 50%, so I have to plan ahead...not sure if that's normal charging, but the battery lasts quite a while between charges, so I'm happy.  And I feel like I got a good deal."}

I can complete simple tasks like DOWNLOADING or ADDING attachments (PDFs) to an email easier on my Android NOTE2 phone than I can on an iPad. The interface is oversimplified. iOS is weak with lots of apps that require hitting the \"Back\" button redundantly. Crazy how much I value my Android OS now.\n\n- Touch screen doesn't work so well for me. I prefer the pressure sensitive Samsung tablet. For some reason I usually have to press a button 1-3 times. I've used other iPads and its the same thing. I have thin fingers so it's not me. I use phablets and computers all day but for some reason the iPad just does like me.\n\n- WEAK SPEAKERS. The HD Fire actually has much better max volume than any iPad. Apple's laptops are the same. Frustrating when you want to watch a movie and the most expensive Tablet on the market has IMO the absolute WORST speakers. My GF owns a Fire 6 HD and it blows a iPad away. I'm constantly hitting the volume button only to be disappointed it's already maxed out. With the Fire HD I usually have it 2 more volume \"ticks\" meaning I rarely ever need to have it on it's high output.\n\nI've used Apple products since 1997. My first computer was a POWER PC... yeah. That far back. I've grown continually frustrated to the point of ANGER at Apple and its method of doing business. Nickel and dime-ing it's loyal customers (iPhone accessories, $20-30 chargers with money hungry proprietary and Apple-only products and connectors)... I've personal grown sick of it. This iPad purchase will be my last Apple Tablet purchase for a long long time. I've grown accustomed to having a Apple desktop and will probably continue to own one... however everything else will NOT be Apple. Over it."}

It's very user friendly for even someone not IT savvy. I'm sure it does lots of extra things that I haven't figured out yet, but I have no complaints so far. I've dropped it once. It landed on its corner on my hardwood kitchen floor and left a dent in the floor - not even a scratch on the iPad. I never put a screen protector on it, and I after a year, I still have no scratches. I keep it in a cheap, soft leather case and often use a tablet pen. I have it LOADED with apps and music. The battery life is excellent still. It will last about two days with me using it constantly during the day. If I just use it here and there, I don't need to charge for a week sometimes. It's my baby, and I don't regret anything about this purchase."}

Then, one day, it just stopped. I lifted it after six hours of charging, and it was still at 4% battery. It won't go past 5- I've plugged it in, and it says that it's not a certified charger.

My old iPad 1st Gen was not handling Facebook well, particularly any videos posted on that site.  I could expect the old iPad to drop me out of Safari multiple times on every video I tried to watch on Facebook.  Of course, YouTube videos were no longer supporting IOS 5.0, so I couldn't view any videos on that site either.  The new iPad 4th Gen is completely stable on Facebook and after more than a month of use, I have not been dropped out of Safari once.  I am still getting used to the different layout on Safari with the bookmarks on the top right of the screen, instead of the left side.  The battery life seems to be better (maybe 25 percent more) than on the 1st Gen iPad.  I have not noticed any heat buildup on the back of the iPad 4th Gen.  Overall, I am absolutely satisfied I made the right choice and upgraded to  the 4th Gen iPad."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B009W9BQMQ", "review": "After years of resisting the tablet craze, I finally picked up an iPad 4 (black, 16GB). I bought it as more of a toy than anything else, but I've found myself using it more and more as a tool for word processing and research. As a biologist, I do my best to stay on top of academic research, and I have found a few apps that streamline the storage and organization of academic PDFs. It's great to be able to read journal articles in full color and HD, zoom in on figures, and annotate while on the move. I still tend to prefer hard copies, but my goodness, it's much easier to carry around 500 10-page articles when they're digital. The built-in Newstand app is where my Science and Nature subscriptions appear, and sadly in that environment your options for interacting with content are more limited. I am also a photographer, but while I appreciate having another device on which to view my photos I much prefer to work with them on my Macbook in Lightroom or a similar program. There are some surprisingly powerful and useful apps for photographers on the app store but none of them are going to hold up to a good photo editing suite on a laptop.\n\nAs for the nuts and bolts, if you like Apple products than you know what to expect. Very streamlined build quality, excellent battery life as long as you aren't watching endless Netflix episodes or similar, and an easy, pleasing user experience all the way around. This model doesn't have some of the bells and whistles of newer versions (touch ID) but the retina display is excellent and responsive. The speakers are surprisingly good for such a compact device. I do recommend a good screen protector and case.\n\nOne criticism I have (mentioned by some other reviewers) is that stylus use on Apple products, including this iPad, is severely limited. You can buy styluses but they all have enormously thick, bulbous and squishy heads. The iPad simply will not register any object that touches the screen if it has a diameter of less than 2mm (I believe that's the number), which means that the sturdy, precision-tipped styluses you might find for a Samsung product or Wacom will not work on Apple devices. I've been told that Steve Jobs thoroughly disapproved of styluses and wanted the user to interact directly with Apple products instead of through a tool. Personally, I'd rather he left us the choice, and I hope this issue will be addressed somewhere down the line. If you're an artist or a graphic designer like my father, it's frustrating not to have a more precise tool with which to interact with the tablet, and it limits the kinds of projects you can undertake. App developers have tried to compensate for this, so far without much success."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B009W9BQMQ", "review": "You can't turn the sound off when taking a photo! This is one of the stupidest things I've ever seen. How is that not an option?\n\nWe had a baby recently and decided to get an iPad because both sets of grandparents live pretty far away, so they are not able to visit much. We figured we would get the iPad so that we could facetime and also because we heard it has a good camera.\n\nWell, what use is the camera if it wakes the baby up every time we use it? The damn shutter sound is so loud! And there appears to be no possible way to turn it off. Even when the entire device is muted, the camera still makes noise. It's awful.\n\nAlso, besides the annoying noise, the camera doesn't even take very good pictures. Most are blurry or very grainy/pixelated (both inward and outward facing cameras). To top it off, there is no flash either, and the thing is so big that it is hard to hold to take pictures with too.\n\nOh, and the video is somehow even worse than the camera. For some reason it is zoomed in very far by default, and you can't change it, so you have to be pretty far away from whatever you are recording in order to actually get it in the shot. It is about impossible to take a decent video in our living room because you can't even get the entire couch on the screen, even from the other side of the room.\n\nBasically, this is about the worst possible device to use as a camera, which is absurd to me because that is one of the main thing they advertise about it... \"get this instead of a kindle because this has a camera\", \"new and improved camera with this generation\", \"tons of megapixels, great resolution\", etc... well no, the camera SUCKS."}

The only reasons you would not be happy with this as a tablet is if you don't understand its limitations. You can't run Android or desktop applications, there are no usb ports, memory card slots, or removable battery. Some of these you can solve with workarounds, such as carrying an external battery brick or using a sd card to lightning adapter.

However, it is not the model in the ad. It was WiFi but included a T-Mobile cellular capability.  The camera was better than advertised.  There was no documentation in the box with the unit. Well, let me restate that -- there was a small card with pictures and labels of the buttons and jacks on the iPad but no other instructions or operating procedures.  A chat with Apple verified it is a 4th Gen with Retina Display.  They sent me a link to a webpage that contained the technical specs on the unit.  We are happy with the iPad, but it was confusing that the model ordered was not the model received.  To be clear, we are pleased with this purchase."}

I am not a technology junkie by any means and have always tried to purchase Samsung products, but I am really glad we chose the ipad.

However, I was not disappointed. I use my iPad every day; I've had it since October. Such a great purchase, and so much cheaper than the most current version. Also, I'm glad i bought the large storage- well worth the money since I never have to delete things to open up space."}

Finally I took the plunge and paid $800 for an iPad. It was great. All that I expected with one exception. I certainly expected my $800 inventory last more than 2 years but it didn't even make it that long. I went to an Apple store and the eventually agreed to sell me a replacement one with no warranty for $200. Well that got me 4 more months of iPad ownership. So now 2 years + 2 months and $1,000 later I am again without an iPad. And all Apple can do is off to sell me a new one!"}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B009W9BQMQ", "review": "The new iOS 8 download requires almost 6 GB of storage, which leaves you struggling to delete enough photos, apps, music and other files from it to make room. It forces you to wipe significant amounts of photos and other files to make room for the update. 16 GB is a glorified paperweight with the new iOS 8. If you have one and you don't want to loose the pictures or apps, then might I suggest that you should not download the update. The new iPad my husband had recently purchased hadn't been updated with the new iOS 8, so my husband unknowingly updated it. He was unable to watch movies or download his music right from the start. He returned it. 16GB is obsolete with new update.  I have had mine for a long time and will not update it because I paid for my apps. Losing money is unacceptable to me."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B009W9BQMQ", "review": "The Apple iPad has been a great product. It is lightweight and has been very durable over the last few years. I have never had the screen crack or system break down. You could use it for school. For example, you can use it for note taking. It is nice not having to carry along a bulky laptop. It doesnt come with a keyboard besides the on screen keyboard, but you can always buy one for relatively inexpensive. Do you need help getting organized or maybe like staying organized? The wide-ranging apps can help you with all off this. They calendars, planers, email, and more!  Some apps do cost money to get, but most actually do not cost anything or if they do, they cost very little. The Retina display is really clear. It has a built in camera.  It can capture precious moments by photo or video! What is also great is that if you have an iPhone or an Apple computer the iPad can communicate with both of them. You can answer phone calls or send text messages with all three of them.  The battery life on some tablets can be very poor, but with the iPad that is something you do not have to worry about. Picture this; you're sitting in class waiting for your next class to start with nothing to do. That doesnt sound fun. Now picture you having the iPad with you! With all the wide-ranging selection of apps out of the Apple app store how could anybody get bored? These are only some of the great features that the iPad has. Its a great product that I still use every day and I got it three years ago. If you get one so will you!"}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B009W9BQMQ", "review": "This iPad worked very nicely and had nice features except it kept dropping the wi-fi signal, and I had to resubmit my credentials every time to reconnect which was annoying, esp. when it dropped at an inconvenient time. This could be due the fact it was used and not properly tested, but doing some reading, it seems that this model frequently has that issue.\n\nMy biggest issue however was the incredibly fragile and cheap glass on the iPad. I simply dropped my stylus on the screen and it created a shatter point. The iPad still works, but it will have to be fixed. Apparently this is a very common thing, because when researching how to get it fixed, there are several companies in the Cincinnati area alone that make a living repairing just the glass for $129 to $159. This is inexcusable in the age of Kevlar cases and Gorilla glass.\n\nI got a Samsung Galaxy tab, and it is IMMENSELY better, esp in the construction and quality. I'll cut the iPad slack in features, because I got a brand new model of the Galaxy, and the iPad was 4th generation, but they were practically the same price!!!\n\nIn summary, if it weren't for the terrible glass and the faulty wi-fi, I would have given it five stars. As it is, if you get a brand new one with good wi-fi and treat it like a baby, then it would be an decent product. But if you want a brand new tablet with better functionality and construction for just a little more money, then get another brand (I highly recommend Samsung)."}

Glad I was home at around 8:00 PM when delivery (on time) was made because package was just left at our door without a nock/door bell being rung. However our dog heard the delivery man and his bark alerted me accordingly. Scary considering all of the \"doorstep theft's\" being made during the Christmas season."}

There are so many things you can do with this tablet and  they update it constantly.  The battery last a very long time.  I bought the cover with the keyboard but soon realized I didn't need the keyboard & took that part off.  They have so many apps and IF I had time, I'd play on it a whole lot more than I do.  My only regret is I didn't get an Apple sooner."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B009W9BQMQ", "review": "I love my iPad so much! It's just fantastic! Works perfectly, set up was a breeze, no issues whatsoever with it! I bought this as manufacturer refurbished but I'm not sure there was ever anything wrong with it considering it came to me in a pristine package with the plastic still wrapped on it with no marking indicating it had been opened previously. All the accessories were there, it was brand new, in my opinion. Super fast and responsive, the touch screen is great, really easy to use with my AmazonBasics stylus, I don't have to press down hard to get it to recognize the style and move. It's actually pretty easy to write with my fingers on it. I use it for class to take notes and also work for research and just to goof off. The battery lasts a really long time, I use it pretty heavily and it'll make it the whole day no problem, I just charge it at night. The screen is really bright and clear, love the camera (it takes fantastic pictures and video)! I bought the one without cell service but since most of my friends have iPhones i can still text and Facetime my friends, which is really cool! It's like having two iPhones, except better! I have Microsoft Office 365 so I also use Microsoft Word, Excel, and Powerpoint on my iPad for projects and they work great on it. I wish I had gone with one with more memory though so I could load more programs on it but eh, not a huge deal to me considering the amount of apps I have on it as well as the number of files I carry on it (I do a lot of research for work so it has a lot of documents and PDFs stored on it). The selection of apps available is fantastic, I have yet to be able to not find an app for something I need. Powers on and off easily, I haven't had any weird glitches or issues with it, works perfectly since the day I bought it. My only regret is that I didn't buy an iPad sooner. It has made my life so much easier!"}

App selection is nearly overwhelming - there is something for everyone. I watch movies on it with & without headphones. Drag & drop features make this a very easy solution for photography editing and books. Typing on a screen takes some getting used to, but it's a small learning curve compared to all of the great features of an iPad. I own a Toshiba Thrive (Android technology) and it crashes constantly, the apps do not run nearly as well as Mac OX systems (the Thrive is the worst computer I've ever owned & I deeply regret the purchase). I've used PCs since the 1980s, but I've completely converted to Apple because their products are better in every way."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B009W9BQMQ", "review": "I purchased this iPad 4 as a birthday/Christmas gift for my father to replace a cheaper tablet he had bought earlier this year. (Said cheap tablet died a horrible death of unknown cause several months back.) I had hoped to keep the iPad a secret but ended up spilling the beans Thanksgiving night, figuring to head off any \"Black Friday\" urge ahead of time.\n\nBetween the 2 of us my father and I have worked on or with computers since 1993. My own first exposure to Apple computers came in college in the late 1980s, but until the iPad came along he had never really paid attention to them, being an old-school sort of feller to whom the Windows operating system was \"IT.\"\n\nWhen his old tablet died, I said \"You really should give the iPad some thought.\" Not long thereafter, the \"hints\" began. I stored them away awhile and finally bit the bullet as they say. He's seldom been happier with anything in the roughly 3 weeks since the iPad arrived. The o/s is different and such, but the \"conversion\" to Apple has been a complete success so far.\n\nI must say a word about Apple's tech support staff: Fantastic! We experienced a problem with the iPad not long out of the box, so to speak. After a short period of unsuccessful attempts to diagnose the trouble, we phoned Apple tech support and explained the problem - which was effectively a \"lockup.\" The gentleman we spoke with very patiently went through the standard set of diagnostic inquiries and had us back up and running pretty quickly all things considered. The best part is it was a simple solution, with a few easy lessons filed away should the need arise again.\n\nIt's a wonderful thing to see a 73 year old former \"dyed-in-the-wool\" advocate of Windows and PC-based systems fall in love with an iPad!"}

I couldn't be happier with its performance.  My wife didn't think it was worth it initially but it has been great at home, on trips, and especially in the hospitals weve spent way too much time in lately.  The screen size is great for her to see and use.  For watching streaming shows and movies, the screen looks great and is plenty big for the face-to-lap distance.  The battery life hasn't been an issue after a year of good use.  It also worked with our iPhones with minimal configuration/setup.\n\nIm not a fan of Apple products (mainly due to the limited software and games) but I have to say this one has worked out great."}

I am glad that I did not jump in sooner at a higher price. The most significant difference from my 2 is Siri. I already have her on my iPhone, and was looking forward to that upgrade.\n\nYes, it is faster.  I see it in opening apps and connecting to the Internet. I also notice my spider solitaire game plays faster. The colors are more vibrant.\n\nBut seriously, if my older model hadn't been dented and dinged, sound controls no longer working, no longer able to synch with my computer, the change wouldn't have been worthwhile. At least not someone whose idea of speed involves solitaire cards.\n\nSadly, one of my favorite games still won't play on 8.1.\n\nA good purchase for me, but at this point in time, check your local discount store for better pricing.  I found the 16 gig at Wallyworld."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B009W9BQMQ", "review": "I've wanted an iPad since they first came out. I'm a devoted Apple/ Mac user since 1995 and I knew this was the iPad for me,  Ordering was simple, and delivery was one day early which is always a welcome surprise.  Although I've only been using this device for a short time, it meets or exceeds everything I expected from an Apple product. Whether you're upgrading from an older iPad or starting with your first, you can't go wrong with this one. The display is brilliant and large enough to read on for extended periods of time. The virtual keyboard is also larger and easier to type on than I had hoped. It's not preloaded with a bunch of unwanted apps but does have the basics to get you started. It took only a few minutes to make the settings \"personalized\" and I was off and running.  I'm more than pleased with this iPad and highly recommend it to anyone and everyone. I know there are cheaper alternatives to Apple products, but you truly do get your money's worth when choosing Apple.  Electronics innovations come and go faster than most of us can reasonably afford to catch up. With Apple, no matter how \"old\" your device is you can count on it still being relevant to today's standards, still capable of keeping up with new technologies, and just as sleek and well designed as the newer models. Overall, my review is always a massive thumbs up for Apple, and two thumbs up for Amazon's pricing, delivery, and helpful reviews,"}

I love to keep my gadgets as neat as I possibly could, and so I loved the ipad when I just got it because it was 'like new' as the seller specified. But  after about three weeks of use, I discovered that the paint at the back had started peeling of, lightly though, like something is scratching it. I decided to get a case to protect it and so I got the apple smart case (new), but alas! That made it worse. At first I thought I wasn't supposed to put the pad in a case but, this is an apple case for crying out loud. My ipad now has scratches all around the right edge at the back, the type that you can feel on your fingers if you run them across the surface where the paint is coming off. I did a little research on the internet as per what my be the cause, and I found that very few people are experiencing the same issue with their ipads or iphones. I guess its the aluminium that's reacting to the type of paint used, or vice versa. Great product though but I would have loved if the ipad is still as clean as it was when I bought it."}

Have the 16Gb and just rotate a bunch of movies and delete them after Im done.. Which is fine..\n\nThe only problem (as all apple products) is that file managing can be really frustrating sometimes.\n\nI have previously posted something about the power plug not comming with the box, but that was just my girlfriend focusing way too much on her new toy and not bothering looking at the box :)\n\nHope this helps..."}

The old power supply kept breaking, this new one seems to have a better fit, much less likely to break.  What can I say about the iPad? Well, it's one of the best things I've ever purchased. My laptop isn't used very much anymore except for downloading pictures. I use the iPad on a daily basis, it does nearly everything the computer does but in a handier way.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B009W9BQMQ", "review": "Well, it WAS great. I got mine new in December 2012. It died on September 6, 2014. Out of warranty, naturally. The \"Genius\" told me that the screen's bad and they can't fix it, yada yada wraparound screen, can't get in, yada yada. They'll gladly give me a new one for only $299.99 though. With a 90 day warranty.  Yeah....no. Not happening. I'm upset that I paid $540 for this and it's DOA in less than two years...I'm also upset that I was nearly halfway through an iBook that I bought and now can't read because I don't have a compatible iOS device. If I'm going to spend another $300+, I'm getting a Galaxy Tab S 8.4, which at least has an SD slot and *not* a proprietary Lightning cable. Here's the kicker...when you buy a non-Apple accessory, there's a good chance your device will tell you it's not legit and then disable it. And another thing--that 32GB goes fast, even if you don't store music on it.\n\nFYI, the \"Genius\" also told me that some iPads last four or five years, some last a year. I guess I should have coughed up the extra $$$ for AppleCare. If I can't get this repaired at the local repair shop, I'm done with iPads. I'll just use Calibre and convert my book to Kindle.\n\nOther issue: frequently drops WiFi, doesn't sync all music with Match."}

Thankfully I had bought an extended warranty through a third-party company. I sent the iPad to them three times to be fixed.  The fourth time, they refunded my money.  I was most certain that I was going to buy another type of tablet and it wasn't going to be an iPad.  I did the research and decided, for the money, I was going to buy another iPad simply because I have a Mac desktop and I wanted them to be compatible with each other.  So I purchased another iPad and I've had it for less than a week and so far I am very happy, thankfully!!!\nUPDATE:\nHere it is 13-14 months later and guess what?  Same problems as before!  Disappointment is an understatement!!!  Just FYI, be sure to buy an extended warranty from Square Trade.  They are excellent!!  They are giving me a FULL cost paid refund a year after I bought the iPad.  They didn't do that the first time around, but maybe because I have been through this before is why they are giving me a total refund, I have no idea.  But I will never buy anything without an extended warranty from Square Trade!  Well worth it!!!  PS Putting the refund toward a new desktop iMac.  I have had this one for 6 years and it's fading.

(Loved that XP).\nMy point is I've never had an Apple. Everyone I know has one and all they do is rave about it so I thought I would give it a go. Well it's my go to book now. I feel sorry now for my Galaxy 5 it's being neglected unless I'm out. I only use the HP if I'm using Windows office or need to print.\nI'm not sure how to do everything yet on here and I know it's a process. I have always used I.E. or Chrome so using Safari is different.\nI'm amazed at the pictures it takes. Far better than any camera I have ever had. In fact I gave my camera away.\nI have a hard time finding apps so that's something I have to work on. I also have to find out how to move my contacts from g-mail. This is going to require me reading the instructions, I'm like a guy here don't like doing that. Haha. But all in all I am very pleased and happy with my I pad. Very much worth what I paid."}

I called the company that manufactured it, and the costs of the replacement screen was MORE than a new one. This deal came up, and we purchased it for our needs ... let's just say I'm not the least bit sorry!\n\nThere's a reason why Apple products are so popular, and I know why everyone was telling me I should get in iPad instead of the other operating system. For a phone, Android works great. For a tablet, a little too clunky, especially with all the bloatware the other manufacturer put on their system. No bloatware on the Apple, and the product was delivered in less than 48 hours from the time of order! Excellent service, excellent product, and a great price."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B009W9BQMQ", "review": "I had the first iPad years ago, and sold it when I got a new laptop. Recently we started traveling extensively in our motorhome. I found the laptop to be heavy and awkward to take places where I could get free WiFi. Bought this iPad and a case with built in keyboard. This iPad is so much more versatile than the older models. It was extremely easy setup out of the box. Very easy device to use, so many useful apps and games. I use Verizon cellular pay as you go, which is quite economical for those times WiFi is not available. The iPad is large enough to display web sites and videos so they are comfortably viewed, but small and light enough for a readily portable device.\nThe only con is that it doesn't have a port-such as USB for anything I want to print. You can work around this by emailing documents to yourself, and go to a library, print shop, or other place (such as Staples) to print copies. It would also be convenient to be able to store photos or other media on a hard disk or other storage device. Meantime I use iCloud or Dropbox.\nFor those who travel, this tablet can be customized with many useful apps. For people who travel with an RV it is invaluable for finding places large enough to gas up, directions to campgrounds or destinations, many apps to find all sorts of campground choices, National Parks and Monuments, places to stay overnight for free, to find attractions or plan your itinerary, etc."}

The biggest thing, of course, is the convenient size of the iPad and the ease of taking it with you, especially when travelling.  The one thing I wish is that it had a USB drive.  Still, I'm very satisfied with the iPad and glad I made the purchase."}

The clarity of the display is brilliant.  I have not activated the Verizon part since I'm not traveling and have Wi-Fi available.  But when I go on vacation or travel, no doubt I'll activate it.  I purchased the ArmorSuit Military Shield and Alpatronix 4-in-one protective Case and will review those separately.  For me both a protective shield and case are \"must have's\" to protect my investment.  For anyone with reservations about technology - you don't have to be a geek to get the Apple iPad going."}

This sticker also says \"Verizon\" in the description line. Set up was very smooth. I can use the ipad with my family plan or a pay as you go plan- ($20 for 1gb monthly. They have more gb for more money) The box is plastic wrapped with a generic sticker over the numbers, so you will have to \"open\" the box. (the generic sticker does not say \"verizon\" which worried me, but the inside sticker did.) Since I get good reception with verizon, I am sure this will work out nicely. It uses your wifi when you are home -or you can select another wifi at your location. If it can't find a wifi, it reverts to the Verizon. Beautiful ipad - will make a great gift."}

If you read any kind of reviews between the Kindle & IPad's, the kindle win's.  And they both do the same.  Depends on how fat your wallet is and what you will be using it for.  I'm not knocking the IPad, I just don't think it's worth money.

So i decided to return this defective product however i got below response from seller and denied to accept return of device which is disgusting and not acceptable :(\n\n\"this seller's returns policy states: Drones, Computers, Video Cameras, Camera, MP3 Players, iPods, iPads, Tablets, Ear phones, Headphones, PC Hardware, Navigation, Point Cards, Software & Projectors- We will not accept any returns if the unit has been open and the factory seal is broken.\"\n\nHow any one can check the product whether  it is working fine or not  before open the item from box.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B009W9BQMQ", "review": "I really like this product. I was debating between the iPad with Retina display, and the Kindle Fire. I tested both, before purchasing the Apple product.  I found the Kindle Fire very difficult to use and navigate through.  While the iPad is VER Y user friendly. It has very easily downloadable Apps. Very easy to navigate from one App to the other. It has very sharp resolution.  In fact, I really could not discern any really noticeable difference in resolution between the iPad and the Kindle Fire. I am sure that professionals,with an \"eye to detail\", might possibly notice a difference, but for \"every day joes\", like me, the iPad is perfectly fine.  Price wise, I got a good deal on the iPad I purchased.  I was only going to purchase a 32GB, but, as I was researching and debating, I just happened to find the 126GB for about the same price as the 32GB.  So, don't be impatient, wait, search, and let Amazon get you a really good product at the best price."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B009W9BQMQ", "review": "This is my third one for personal use and have also purchased others for my wife, kids and as donations to her 3rd grade classroom. I especially like the 4th generation because all the cases and covers for the 2nd and 3rd generation fit perfectly but it has the lightning adapter so the techie products work with it. I wasn't sure about the 9 pin vs. 30 pin cable but the 9 pin has the advantage of not having a top or bottom so I don't need to find my glasses or turn on a light to see which side is up. I was also very pleased to be able to get the 4th generation at a significant savings over the iPad Air. The fraction of an inch difference in thickness doesn't mean much when you put your iPad in a case for protection or use a combination case and keyboard. (I really like my ZAGG, which I picked up at a huge discount when the Air was introduced.)\n\nI bought the iPad 2 when it first came out, actually pre-ordered it, and had been using it for hours every day so I really don't think it owed me anything. It was developing a few quirks and I was maxing out the 16 GB of memory so for less than the cost of a 16 GB Air I was able to purchase a 32 GB 4th gen. I can now download and use one of the 5 tablet downloads for Microsoft Office that came with the \"Office 365\" I purchased without fear of over extending the memory and also download movies for use on trips.\n\nI know they are more expensive, but there is a reason. Having had a Samsung Tablet and and Asus tablet, the iPad is just better. Are there things I wish they'd change? Sure! Like the keyboard design that is always in upper case and doesn't show numbers and ...... (come to think of it, that is my only complaint!)\n\nThey won't be around long, so if you've been considering an iPad don't hesitate to grab one of the 4's with Retina Display and save some serious money."}

The problem lies in the fact that iPads are not checked to make sure they are no longer connected to the previous owners iCloud account. In the event this happens there is absolutely no way to use the iPad (I tried everything) which makes it a huge disappointment. Especially since this was the second one I purchased (the other was from another seller) that arrived \"locked\". Although I had a terrible experience with this item customer service was quick, friendly, and I received a full refund as soon as they received the item back. So it could've ended worse I suppose.

I've watched all the, \"Apple snobs,\" spend ungodly amounts of money on their, \"Over rated,\" products, and laughed.  Meanwhile, while they were still using their IPhone 4's, IPad 1st generations, and 4 year old laptops, I had gone through 4, count them, 4 android phones, 3 laptops, and 2 kindle fires.  My wife and daughter, (The smarter one's of our family), have been touting their Apple products to me, while I turned a deaf ear.  Well, after the death of a Samsung Tab, I took the plunge.\n\nThis is the fastest, smoothest running, easy to use, best powered, most versatile, electronic stud, I've ever used, and this is a 4.\nPictures are good, but it's the apps, and the power of this thing to run several of them, without crashing, shutting down, slowing down, or giving me error messages, (ala Windows).  It does some things faster, and much more efficiently than my laptop.\nAs a Musician, I can use Garage Band, and video editing apps, for our live footage, and even editing our music videos.  It does this quickly, seamlessly, and without crashing, (Again, ala Windows), all on something I can carry to a restaurant, or Starbucks.  I got a keyboard and case for the thing, for $30.00 on Amazon, and now, my laptop, just kind of sits there.\n\nDon't hesitate.  This thing is so far out of the league of Windows, and more solidly built than any Android, I will never go back.  I guess it's like riding a Harley, or driving your first Porsche.  You feel the quality, and just can't go back to your Ford Escort EXP.

I wanted to purchase their Apple Plus warranty, but they only allow you to do that within 30 days from the date of purchase. When I applied, Apple asked for the serial number of the device and after entering it they informed me that it had been purchased by the reseller several months before and, as a result, they would not extend me their product warranty. I explained that the device was new and in the original packaging, but the representative I subsequently spoke with said that because it had been on their shelf for months they couldn't verify it's condition. I asked if it would make any difference if it had sat on the shelf in an Apple store for the same period of time and the rep said he had to speak with his supervisor. When he returned he said that Apple would not offer me their warranty and advised me to return the device to the seller and buy a new one from an Apple store. How does that make sense?"}

I have a 2007 desktop that runs Windows (which I recently ditched for Linux Mint) and it has always been my workhorse. I do a lot of graphic design work, school essays, and quite a bit of writing as a hobby. Last year I purchased a Samsung Galaxy Tab 7 inch and still like it for the most part, but even I--a \"no knowledge with a mac\" person--must admit the tab and other devices like it don't come anywhere close to the complete experience with the ipad. My main reason for not buy this has been because I had never really gotten my hands on one up close. Then one day my son walked in with one, and I was blown away by the ease of use combined with applications that work so naturally. I spent hours upon days tweaking the galaxy tab and fighting notifications. None of that with this device. It's smooth, durable, and brilliant. I also purchased a Smart Cover which works just fine but I might end up getting one of the clamshell style cases for use as a laptop when I'm out and about. As I type this, the iWork suite is updating in the background and the lightning cable is connected without any slowdown at all. Couldn't get that much out of the android tablet. I am also using the Anker bluetooth keyboard and it works perfectly. If anyone out there is considering a switch from android to ipad, I suggest going for it."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B009W9BQMQ", "review": "It's termed the iPad 4 but technically it's the iPad 6.\n\nI bought this particular model several months after its release at an AT&T store in a mall.  They had it in stock, so I was thrilled with the fact that I could walk out of the store on my lunch break with a fully functioning new iPad.  I'm a sucker for picking things up in person, unless it means waiting on a line with people who think they are 'making history' with their purchase, in which case I just have it shipped to me at home or work, most likely from Amazon.\n\nThis is my first iPad.  I held off on buying one because I'm a film geek and wanted a full HD display.  When Apple came out with the Retina Display, I thought, \"That's great, but with a maximum of 64GB it's still just a toy.  I need at least 120GB.\"  And then they came out with a 128GB model plus a better port and it was time to buy.  All my friends who rushed to buy the first iPad, the iPad 2, and 'The New iPad' as the 3rd generation model was called were definitely jealous; but more important for me was that I got exactly what I wanted.\n\nIn fact I was so happy with getting exactly what I wanted that when the iPad Air came out, a little faster and lighter than the one I bought, it didn't make a difference to me.  Sure, I'm looking forward to when Apple comes out with what I predict will be a larger, more powerful, fully functioning computer in iPad form--and I'm predicting it will be called the iPad Pro--but even then I'll probably wait until at least the next generation of that model before buying it unless it features the ability to use Final Cut Pro (which no current iPad can do).\n\nWill you regret buying this one instead of the iPad Air or waiting for the next model?  I don't think so.  First thing, it's nearly as powerful as the iPad Air, and if you wait for the next model you're going to pay top dollar.  If you wait for the price to drop, then you're going to want the model after that.  And the cycle of suffering on this matter is endless.\n\nWhen you're ready to buy, then buy.  Buy the one you want.  This one versus the Air, personally I think the only significant difference is price, that you're not missing something.  Just make sure to buy it new from an authorized Apple dealer."}

However, I was greatly surprised by noting that none of these applications can be\nremoved in the usual way (by pressing the icon, waiting for an \"x\" to appear, etc.). I contacted Apple support; they explained\nme how to remove these applications with the help of iTunes on PC. That was OK, but certainly I didn't expect that removing\nan application should be so complicated. Although the Ipad was declared as being new, I had the impression that somebody used it before and messed the iOS. Being rather disappointed, I start playing with the device for a few days. Not knowing what else to do, I decided to reset the iOS (iOS6 to iOS7). Surprisingly, that was a step that resolved all the problems! The Ipad started working normally, and I don't expect to have similar problems in the future.

The functionality of the iPad 4 on wireless only is absolutely sufficient for my use. If I need to use the iPad outside of a wireless network I have sufficient storage to save up to 64G of music, videos or audiobooks for that use. When I am online, this device works perfectly for email and internet surfing.\n\nI use it at work for email that I cannot access on my work computer and at home for reading, audiobooks, and games when I am away from my home computer. The display is all it is advertised as being - crisp, high definition - and the apps available to me are more sufficient.\n\nAt home, with its wireless connection I can \"read in bed,\" play games, catch up on emails, use the device as an alarm clock... if I think of something I need to look up in the middle of the night I can look it up on this device ... so it is a VERY handy tool and entertainment vehicle.\n\nI am pretty sure that other tablets can provide similar uses... and possibly at lesser cost That said, the retina display and the Apple reputation (I am admittedly an Apple user at home and a Windows system user at work) are impressive, and worth the cost as far as I am concerned."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B009W9BQMQ", "review": "The iPad is fabulous. Received as promised on 2/19/13. But before I even opened the factory-sealed packaging, I called Apple support to verify that the serial # (which was visible on the outside) was not registered to another Apple user.\n\nI had read in some of the reviews that people thought they were buying brand new iPads on Amazon, but received used ones. When I spoke to Apple, the person on the phone, Abby, was very helpful. She stated that the serial # I gave was not registered to an Apple user. However, it was listed as purchased back in Oct 2013. I asked if that meant this was a used iPad. She said not necessarily. As I was buying from a distributor through Amazon (Xr Distributors was the one mine came from), it could be that they bought the iPads and resold them without any customer having used them in the meantime. The downside is that the 1-year warranty that iPads come with would expire in Oct 2014, taking away from the amount of time I expected to have a warranty.\n\nI contacted the seller to let them know what Apple said, and they replied to my query within two hours. John T., who was listed as Operations Manager, apologized in the email for the inconvenience and said that all their iPads were brand new factory sealed. If I wanted to return it and buy one directly from Apple I could, or he would give me a $25 credit for the inconvenience.\n\nI really appreciated the gesture and opened the iPad to find that it was brand new, never used, and it's such a wonderful product. I'm glad I chose the 32GB as well because I shouldn't have to think twice about space issues. I also love the retina display.\n\nI'm very happy with my purchase, and I replied to the seller that I would absolutely be keeping this wonderful product and would take the $25 credit, which I'm assuming will be toward Amazon, but I won't know until I receive it I guess."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B009W9BQMQ", "review": "I have 2 iPads previously and so when time came to buy another, iPad was the top contender, but given the rising popularity of Microsoft Surface and Samsung Galaxy tab, I decided to try those out. MS Surface won hands down in my experience.\n\nFirst off, you can actually run more than one website on the Surface. If playing a Youtube video on the Surface and at the same time briefly browsing a different website, the Youtube video continues to play. Not so on the iPad. The video stops the momemt you browse to another website even in a different tab.\n\nSecondly, as far as Youtube is concerns the Surface version runs all videos like a full blown laptop. The iPad version runs only a subset of the videos and tells you to play the others on a computer.\n\nThirdly, the Surface has a built in stand. No need to buy a cover stand separately.\n\nFourth, even when not using the stand, the Surface is much easier to hold in the hand - slips much less than the iPad.\n\nI like the Surface user interface for switching from one browser tab to another better than the iPad. Not sure if that's a definite win for everyone since some folks may prefer the IPad.\n\nNot to mention the Surface is about half the price. True, iOS has more apps, but for all the apps I use (Amazon Instant Video, Netflix, Youtube, Skype, WhatsApp, email, browser, Yelp, and some travel related apps), both have all the apps needed. In fact the Surface has more Office apps for those who care about Powerpoint and Word."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B009W9BQMQ", "review": "We bought the iPad in April 2013 and by December 2013, an internal defect had developed which rendered the device useless.  When we brought the device to the Apple Store, they determined that Apple's one-year warranty had expired, which seemed impossible since we had only had the device for nine months.  Evidently, the warranty date must have been triggered from the distributor's purchase date and not our purchase date from Amazon.  So, in short, we lost about three months of Apple's warranty on our \"new\" iPad.  Upon contacting the distributor, PMG Distributors, they were disrespectful and ultimately non-responsive to our concerns.  Amazon, too, was unhelpful.  In sum, we were disappointed by both the product's failure and Amazon and the seller's handling of the manufacturer's warranty."}

Basic requirements of music/video playback, or pdf/ebook (personal collection) reading out of the box is non existent. That along with a mere 16gb of storage does make this still a purchase worth thinking twice about. And to top it all the memory increment is exorbitantly overpriced, especially looking at the contemporary SD/microSD card prices. Apple still continues to rake in moolah just by flaunting their brand, though the reliability of the same is increasingly deteriorating."}

There are so many better products out there, but somehow the iPad is rated as number one everywhere you go. Sure, the access to apps are nice. But I've had cheap laptops with far less problems, and you could actually use it for more than apps and web browsing. Way over priced."}

I gave one to my hubby for his birthday last year and for the first time in his life, he can do the things he wants like email, web browsing, and Facebook.  In all the years I've been using iPads, I've never had issues as I've had with Windows devices. I like the expanded memory in this version and it was the principle reason I purchased it over the other new features introduced since the iPad2.  I have my entire music collection loaded and I like that. It is the first time I've been able to carry it all with me on any mobile device. In fact, with the new product integration Apple has introduced, I purchased a MacAir. Now I have reliability of performance and convenience I've never before had in computing platforms. I use this iPad with a matching Logitech keyboard/cover and carry it in an iPad purse. Now I can edit my documents wherever I go. As a writer, I love it. FWIW, I've worked in the computing industry all my life and have experience with multiple operating systems and networking."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B009W9BQMQ", "review": "I ordered  and paid for a 4th generation I-Pad with retina and received a 2nd generation I-Pad from Amazon.  The two I-Pads look identical and the only reason I caught the difference was the charger cord.  The 4th generation uses a smaller plug compared to the 2nd generation.  Amazon was called immediately about the screw up wherein the correct I-Pad was mailed via Fed-X with one day delivery to me.  I sent the 2nd Generation back and shipping was paid by Amazon.  My credit card was debited twice until Amazon rec'd the 2nd Generation I-pad back.  Once my credit card rec'd the credit there was a note that it had been returned because of being shipped late.  This was obviously not the reason and couldn't be further from the truth.\n\nJust be aware that a 2nd Generation I-Pad looks the same as the 4th Generation with the exception of the charger plug.  Make sure you check the model of your I-Pad found in the settings area.  The 2nd Generation cost less than the 4th Generation by a couple hundred dollars."}

Constantly drops the network, even after I installed a network analyzer and check that for signal all the time.  My other devices never have this problem. Could not pair via Bluetooth to other devices , grabbing pictures from other devices is a pain in the butt if it works at all.  Does not recognize non-apple devices even with the proper cables.  Takes forever for network pages to load when it does recognize the network. Feel like throwing it against the wall at least once a day. The touch screen is sometimes unresponsive and Safari crashes _all_the_time.  And thanks for the blasted autocorrect bs, apple, I know what word I want to use. Extremely frustrating product."}

Apple does not cover under warranty and considers it \"abuse\" which it was not!!!  They wanted $299 to give me another device at the Apple Store I took it to.  I called Apple Support they told the store to give me another one at \"no cost\".  I think there is a flaw in the design of the charging cable so be very careful when using it to charge your iPad and if this happens to you, do what I did and ask for an exception.  Hope this helps."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B009W9BQMQ", "review": "Actually this product purchased from anywhere else would likely be great but purchasing this from Tech Giant was a giant mistake.\nNo where in their product description or posting did it state that this iPad did not come with a sim card. I think that it was dishonest of them to not mention this. Who wants to do business with a company like that?  I originally thought that it was an error on their part and that once alerted to this they would make it right.  I sent them an email and when that didn't get a response I went to Amazon's Customer Service.  They kindly wrote an inquiry for me but they didn't even get a response.  If I had discovered it sooner I would be shipping this back, but unfortunately for me it was just after the allowed return date!  So, I am sounding the alarm for all who would be tempted to purchase from them - don't buy from Tech Giant."}

Imitators can't even come close.\n\nIncredible battery life\nsuper fast and responsive\nyou can feel the quality once you hold it in your hand\nthe RETINA DISPLAY is AMAZING!!!!

Pictures, Movies, music, games etc...\n\nI would recommend this tablet to ANYONE. You can't go wrong with this device. You will NOT be disappointed. Their is a reason why Apple is the industry leader and it's because of devices like this. Don't fall for cheaper imitators and look a likes. Nothing compares to the iPad."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B009W9BQMQ", "review": "I was slow to justify the cost of an iPad and despite being a long time fan of Macs, didn't really see the need for one. I found myself in a job where I am on very remote locations with quite a bit of downtime and finally decided that I could use one.\n\nI have been absolutely thrilled with this device. It is extremely stable, even with the new iOS 7 operating system. I am very happy that I chose the Retina model, because the screen is basically perfect. For everything from web browsing to watching Netflix, the quality of video and images is second to none.\n\nApp performance on the iPad Retina is superb, and many of the iPad specific apps are simply mind-blowing, particularly some of the art apps like Sketchbook Pro and Procreate. I recently acquired an Adonit Jot 4, which is a pressure sensitive stylus that connects via Bluetooth, and it works like something out of the future. Just crazy good. For forum participation, writing Amazon reviews, etc., I prefer my laptop simply because I don't like typing on a touchscreen, but that's just my personal preference. I can get around on the touchscreen and if I really wanted a physical keyboard, there are several available. But that's not really what the iPad is all about. It's not there to replace your computer; it's a different type of device that excels at browsing and media consumption and is portable in a way that no laptop is.\n\nThough it takes a bit longer than I would like to take a full charge, the battery life is excellent, and I rarely find myself needing to charge when I am out and about.\n\nAs a media consumption / web browsing device, the iPad Retina is ideal. The screen is so amazing that it is generally preferable to me over a larger computer or laptop screen for these purposes. I take a star off of my rating because USB connectivity would be REALLY helpful for those who would like to watch movies that they have stored on an external drive. There really is no reason that the iPad shouldn't have USB.\n\nI love my iPad, and it is so usable in this current configuration that I don't see myself having to replace it with the latest and greatest for many years."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B009W9BQMQ", "review": "I was skeptical that I'd use this all that much, but I'm hardly ever without it now. I use it to check stocks, weather, and news while I'm working, and to watch videos, play games, and read Twitter when I'm not. It's a big large and a bit heavy, so the mini or the new iPad Air might be recommended now for frequent travelers like myself. A good case that doubles as a stand is a must, but you don't have to overspend; I've found a couple I like a lot for $10, and at that price you can abuse them and discard them.\n\nWhat I thought I'd use it for was showing off my photos on the fabulous Retina display, but I actually mostly use it for the fantastic apps, like the one I use to download TV eps from YouTube to watch on the plane and another I use to download podcasts.\n\nIt is NOT great for Web browsing (altho it's certainly capable) or ANY productivity applications. I do VERY little typing on it, and I wouldn't bother even trying to mess with business documents like spreadsheets and presentations. I'm sure there are those who swear by some presentation app or something, but I'm happy to do work on a laptop and keep the iPad for secondary distractions."}

It's like the Toyota and Honda cars from the 80-90s, the engine keeps running even if the frames falls off.\n\nIn daily usage of over a year, I don't have a SINGLE major complaint about this product which is pretty amazing seeing as I try to find at least one thing to not give a product 5/5... I could nitpick on some minor things but this tablet is really that good (my macbook pro for example has a poorly designed graphics card that overheats all the time and makes me hate the product...) but this tablet, I would give it 10 stars if I could.\n\nBattery lasts forever, touch screen is the most accurate I have ever used, screen resolution is ridiculous (not just on paper, physically look and compare with competition), OS does not crash and the damage done by an app is contained to its process (very similar to QNX), plethora of apps including Google Chrome, Skype works great (anyone who has used Skype on Android knows what I'm talking about), and the list goes on and on...\n\nThe only improvement I can think of is the weight and an affordable cover case for the tablet.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B009W9BQMQ", "review": "First let me say I own several Apple products. I own iPhones and iPad 2. I bought the ipad 4 because of the price drops when the air was announced. I think we all can recognize that the Ipad as well as most tablets won't replace laptops and won't replace the PC or Mac for work. I use my ipad for entertainment and web and email and photos. The retina display is no big deal and actually makes photos look worse. I found many references to this in other reviews, but really did not believe for myself until I compared side by side with ipad 2. Mostly photos taken with camera phones of loer pixels look horrible on ipad 4 but good or even great on ipad 2. I am not impressed with the increased processor speed, as you really would not notice it anyway unless you play video games. I do not. Overall, there is really no discernible benefit to spend the money and replace an ipad 2. Of course if you did not own an ipad before, or owned the original, I highly recommend ipad over other tablets. I have owned and used many android based, and the Apple iOS I find better and much more stable. I give three stars solely based on the fact I don't see significant improvement between ipad 2 and 4 and the retina display is not a big deal,for web, email and apps. I might have been better to wait till my ipad 2 died and purchased the air ."}

When I first heard about the Retina display, I was sort of shocked by it and a bit doubtful. I thought there was no way that they can make the display any better... but I was wrong, it looks better than any still photo! It looks more real, realer. It is absolutely amazing. I got the 16GB Wifi only and have not had a problem with it once. I did get this one since I was not interested in the iPad Air that they had coming out, and I already had a 7 inch Kindle, so I was not interested in the iPad mini that was already on sale.\n\nI do not regret this purchase at all, everything on it works wonderfully, I got a Fintie case for it that rotates which is wonderful, and I must say that this iPad is the only thing in the world that is as close to perfect as anything or anyone can get. Pictures look wonderful, games look fantastic, and The Cloud works very well on this device. There is no set up time, just enter your email and password (or make an account) and that is it you are ready to use/share on The Cloud.\n\nI have to say now after experiencing Apple and their products, I now will be purchasing all their products (the products that I need) so they can all work together and accommodate one another. Right now I have an iMac and iPad and they work wonderfully together. Syncing my PC takes a bit more time, but it does indeed work. Although it is not as quick or seamless as my Apple products syncing with each other, but of course they are using the same iOS, etc. so that is understandable.\n\nThis device is a masterpiece, best little computer there is, and is a absolute pleasure to have.\n\n5 stars all the way!!

The only downside is this will look like a tank compared to the new Air, not because this is big, just because they did such a good job with the new one."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B009W9BQMQ", "review": "I was given this iPad as a graduation gift to use during medical school.  At first, I wasn't sure if it would be useful at all; rather, I thought it might be a distraction from my studying. After about two months in school, I absolutely LOVE this thing! The iPad is extremely useful and portable for studying anywhere, anytime.  It offers several different apps that allow you to store PDF documents, highlight, and annotate.\n\nA helpful tip for people interested in using this for school.  I subscribed for a free membership at Acrobat.com -- an Adobe product. This was a 100% free program.  You download the Acrobat app to your iPad, and it will allow you to view, highlight, and annotate.  The beauty of Acrobat is that they give you 5GB of free online storage.  (5GB is almost unheard of to get for free... Drop Box only offers 2GB for free.)  Once you have your Acrobat.com account set up, log on to the website from your desktop/laptop (wherever you have your PDF documents stored).  From there, you upload your PDFs to Acrobat.com, and you can access them anywhere and anytime by logging on to the website.  Your website login info will be saved in the Acrobat app on your iPad, and you can study and annotate your PDFs from there.  Once you are done studying, Acrobat automatically saves your modifications to those PDFs, so you can view your latest modified document ANYWHERE.  If you forget your iPad one day, you can log in on any computer and view/modify your documents from Acrobat.com.  **By using Acrobat.com you will not use up any of your iPads hard drive space, so the 16GB was more than enough for me.\n\n^^ Sorry about that tangent, but I found this extremely helpful, and I wanted to share it with everyone!  Overall, I am extremely happy with the iPad.  It is EXTREMELY user friendly.  It is also versatile and can be used for almost any purpose.  Definitely consider the iPad if you are looking to use it for games, study, internet browsing, etc..."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B009W9BQMQ", "review": "I own an iPad because it has business apps I use that are best used with a touch screen. One pros side, there's not much I can add to what's already been said. It is great and I'm glad I upgraded from an iPad 2 to iPad 4.\n\nBut I'm deducting one star for the following reasons:\n\nApple wants to upsell you from the iPad 2 to the iPad 4 mostly on this criteria:\n\n1) Siri. There's nothing revolutionary about it. For most it's answers it just spits out Google search results and then you do the rest. People are fascinated by it because it throws a few human-like colloquialisms.\n\n2) Retina display. I upgraded from an iPad 2. To quite frank, things do no all of a sudden jump out at you in iPad 4. Yes, I do like it. And it's very nice to be sure. But the Retina Display is just a name someone dreamed up that makes it sound more innovative than it actually us. High resolution is everywhere. It's just that Apple give it a snazzy name and suddenly, it's like the a new invention.\n\n3) \"A6 is 2x faster than A5\" Huh? Reality check. This one is probably where I feel people are misled the most. To me the A5 is noticeably faster and that's nice. But in real life \"twice as fast\" means 50 mpg vs 25 mph. Or flying from L.A. to Hong Kong in 8 hours instead of 16. To me the speed difference is more like flying from L.A. to Hong Kong in 14 hours instead of 16.\n\nAll in all, there a lot of hype that used to make the iPad 4 sound like a quantum leap rather than the incremental improvement that it is. Thus we pay more for it.\n\nThat said, I like it a lot, but mainly for the reasons that people have liked the iPad ever Steve Job unveiled on that big screen behind him...not because of these minor improvements."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B009W9BQMQ", "review": ".....Not right and to not have the ability to get social media off my computer is like being controlled by the \"apple regime\":\nI want to state upfront that the first computer I ever bought  was the apple II gs when apple first made computers and subsequently bought over 29+ computers with windows os due to business compatibility apps. I even set up 1 of laptops for dual os usage--- Linux and windows. I really loved Linux the bests but apps are hard to find. So,after nearly 35 yrs of computer usage,I feel I can objectively rate the apple iOS on my new ipad. I heard,read,and researched info. About apple and thought I should change over after conferring with my husband (senior software engineer) who said apple now has business apps for the professional population. That said: here I am after only one week of owning an iPad and I AM CONSIDERING getting rid of it, the main complaints about windows are: 1) windows 8 2) privacy, 3) the wga genuine harassment (paid a lot of money for msn windows 7 and EVEN with re-doing I'd numbers back and forth --- I constantly got a \"not genuine\" tag that constantly pops up no matter what I did--- I had been using the same os and upgraded to professional, and after a year, for some reason,it started popping up the WGA harassment!  4) during os scans,Microsoft data,,virus,identifying, LSO ,was the #1 culprit that were \"infecting\" my computer!  With these 4 windows os  ( there are FAR more) issues , I decided to leave that os. NOW The iPad issues : 1) apple support (for HOW to use this iPad--- not repairs or apps , all of which are general) I am being forced to give the serial number which I know to be a \"record\" of my personal computer. And NO I am NOT interested in a relationship with apple EVER. Don't I have the right to know how to use this expensive piece of ----- I hadn't even turned it on because I didn't want ios7 automatically downloading on my ipad! And the rep lied and said it wouldn't  and I have full control. Over it not happening. Well, it DID auto download without my permission! Even though it isn't installed, IT Is the manipulative,greedy, way that Apple is controlling over what I want to download . Now,I can't get rid of it,and this nagging update flag is in plain sight on my computer every time I turn it on, this control reeks of dictatorship without any regards to MYRight to use my computer! 2) I didn't buy this iPad for facebook or twitter or ANY social Media at all! Instead of going to the media website and installing it BY MY choice, it is everywhere ---- my settings, shows up in website address bar as I am typing which website I wANT to go to. And if my finger slips on it or I accidentally tap those sites, I get connected or it begins to install itself! This alone disgusts me no END! 3) all software downloads have to come through the apple store---how proprietorial is that! That , too, I didn't know. What I was told was that apple apps are virtually virus free without \"bug\". So why can't I download the free open office word processor directly from the Internet? Another  dictatorial control of apple. (4) the web browser is awful! No way of setting privacy features such as third party cookies (instead there is an \"always\" , \"never\" or when I visit,to always accept all cookies. A site by site \"allowable cookie\" option is not available. And I can't even get redirects stopped when I do a first party website connection,  No add ons, and I have to remember every time I leave the site or shut down, to have all browser history deleted and cookie deletion. Safari is the ONLY web browser because all other browsers have to go through apple's  exclusive browser and it slows down Internet service. (5) email is not user friendly. It is difficult to have all email sites linked to this feature. In fact, using emails other than gmail,yahoo is almost impossible. I don,t use them at all. (6) having to constantly use a password each and every time I access they apple stop is time consuming and the iPad doesn't allow me to have it automatically saved.\nWell there's the review.like I said ,i am considering getting rid of my ipad. In fact, I am trying to find a reason (s) to keep it. If I get rid of iPad--- I will use Linux only--- it is extremely popular in  Europe"}

I really was going to upgrade to an IPad with larger internal storage but have SERIOSLY changed my mind.  I have been an IPad user since the first generation.  This retina display 64 is my 4th IPad and the pad itself is great but the operating system is now AWFUL.The keyboard is frustrating with many quirks.  He functions operate at a much slower speed, the battery life is greatly diminished, with the new calendar app you may as well just use an old paper day timer.  Safari takes longer to load up internet pages....and much more.  The new upgrade is a farce and I will not buy another iPhone (on my 5th) or iPad again.  Once these are gone, I will not replace them.  My suggestion would be to learn another operating system.  Androids are cheaper, and I've found my Kindle to be a new companion and easier to use since IOS-7.  The system used to be very user friendly and actually kinda classy looking, but now it's design takes after  operating in an old Windows computer in SAFE mode 24-7.  And who wants that. It is absolutely NOT visually stimulating at all.  We went from a classy Cadillac Made In the USA look to a cheap Chinese knockoff.  Again, buy something else....  Apple has stepped into the Microsoft realm of hated upgrades...."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B009W9BQMQ", "review": "The first Ipad was incredibly innovative. By the fourth, it seems comparatively lackluster. That isn't to say that the product is bad, or worse than its predecessor, but having owned the 1st, 3rd, and now 4th generation Ipad, here are my thoughts.\n\n-- The processor speed and performance is much improved. This is noticeable during use, and the only reason to get the latest version.\n\n-- The Retina Display is nice, but personally I wasn't as impressed with it as I hoped to be. Likely because fonts and such are all still the same size. For photographers, the increased resolution will result in extra sharpness, but for most users it won't make a bit of difference.\n\n-- The latest iPad really hasn't added much; it's competitors have been adding innovative designs and features since it came out. Apple needs to come up with a creative twist on the iPad that makes the cost difference worth the purchase.\n\nBottom Line: I have bought iPads for work use, to test products and features we develop. They are a nice, simple product. If I was making a personal buying decision, I'd go with a competitor for what I perceive to be a significant difference in price/capability."}

When the technician keyed in the serial number on his own screen, he found that this particular iPad had been manufactured in 2011 AND SOLD IN DECEMBER 2012 - five months before I purchased it !!\n\nI can only conclude that the original customer returned it to Amazon, which fraudulently resold it to me as a new iPad without having properly repaired it.\n\nFortunately,  the Apple store replaced it for free."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B009W9BQMQ", "review": "Lets face it, you buy Apple products at their ridiculously high price because it's a quality item. Safari is an wasting Internet browser to use and, while you can't customize settings as much as a laptop computer, it has excellent malware protection and is set up very conveniently for the casual browser. It's a good weight too. While shopping for my tablet, I've looked at and held many other brands. A common problem (for me) is that a lot of them felt too light for their size. This is probably because apple uses aluminum for the back cover of their tablet instead of plastic. It feels sturdy, and that's a good thing when it comes to durability. Another excellent apple quality? The apps! I know, other tablets have apps too, but apple has kind of cornered the market on app production. Most of what you can find on an android or kindle tablet, you can find in the apple store (and then some). See an app not available through apple? Probably a good thing! I've learned that Apple screens all of their apps before putting it up in the store. This means that there are no major malware problems.\n\n There are some disadvantages of course: 1- you have to buy directly from apple as they do have monopoly on their stuff and a lot of imitation items are suspect (this can get pricey), 2- you can't really open two screens the way you can simultaneously on other devices. This is not to say that you can't have two (or more) things running at once, but you have to switch entirely between them and can't view both on the screen at once. 3- there are many conveniently pre-downloaded onto other tablets that are very useful for students and office work. You can get a lot of those same apps through the apple store, but many of the better ones are not free and you have to pick and choose your way through quite a few applications.\n\nThere are probably more then 3, but these are the ones that stood out to me. Overall though, PROs totally outweigh the CONs, making this tablet just plain awesome! (So awesome that my best friend saved started saving up for one right after mine came in the mail.)"}

However, that's no longer true, at least when comparing iPad 4 to my HTC One. iPad 4 is just as smooth as HTC One, and is still laggy sometimes (For example the frame rate of some animation drops significantly). The screen is a bit yellow, and its overall performance is on a par with HTC One. iPad 4's hardware technically is faster, but no any difference is found on system speed so far. Therefore, iPad has no advantage over HTC One, except the much bigger screen.\nOn the other hand, Android is of course MUCH freer and easier to use. The iOS and iTunes always takes me hours to do something that can just be done in three minutes on Android. (Copying pictures from iPad that was not taken as photos, etc)\nI was SHOCKED when I found I cannot install an IME or a system tool, cannot customize the system UI or configuration, and even cannot copy files from others' computer without logging into iTunes!

The iPad may have been ok besides that but since it was needed for it's connection to the internet it was worthless to me when it was needed most. If a SIM card needs to be purchased separately that should be clearly stated. This is the 4th (and maybe the last) iPad in the family and we have never had this problem before. I was very disappointed."}

I will still use windows-based computers and my Samsung Galaxy droid phone, but I have to admit that when it comes to a tablet, the Apple iPad4 is the way to go!!! WiFi connection is never a problem, the OS is super fast, the retina display is awesome, the feel of the tablet is nice, the sound is okay, the camera takes high quality pics/vids, the battery life is long, and I love all of the apps that are available. Also, I'm in the healthcare profession and often need to reference medical information quickly, so having this tablet provides me with the ability to get information in real time (using medical apps) and/or record notes all while at the patient's side.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B009W9BQMQ", "review": "I would have given it 5 stars. But even though the Amazon Market Place's packaging for shipment was as good as required for shipping and delivering this type of merchandise, and that the Apple iPad factory box was undamaged, both wrappings intact and unopened, the iPad screen came with a noticeable two centimeter hairline scratch on top center, right below the camera lens. The scratch was visible through the factory envelope-like cellophane wrapping around the iPad itself. That type of scratch, could not had happened at the seller's warehouses, nor during transportation/delivery because it requires direct contact with the screen to produce it and as I explained the delivery package and product box where undamaged and unopened, so responsibility lies with manufacturing facility during or before final boxing of the iPad, which says a little of quality assurance and control in this case. That is, I do not blame Amazon nor the seller for the problem in this particular case (first time ever).\n\nThat aside, the new iPad is working nicely and has a great retina display (colors, graphics, resolution...) and great speed. But I still will not give it the fourth and fifth stars, because contrary to what I'm used, and expect, to get from Apple products, this one didn't have that mint condition look that I expected from and Apple's new item. Instead of going trough the process of returning with all the time delay and implications (customs in my country for once)I installed a anti-glare/mate screen protector to \"hide\" the scratch, which somehow defeats the purpose of the great retina display\n\nIMPORTANT UPDATE: IOS 7 have a feature that cannot be turned of, which verifies that the Lightning connector is certified by Apple, and as soon as I update to IOS 7, and connected my iPad to be charged with the Lightning connector that came with the iPad in the original, brand new, sealed and unopened factory box I got a pop up display that stated that my iPad connector isn't certified and my not function properly with my iPad. I reported this to apple via chat support and the agent told me, after running an online diagnostic, that my device and connectors were new and that it was a glitch in the IOS 7 verifying routine that would be fixed on a next release (update of IOS 7), so I dismissed (every time) the message and charged my iPad without problems. But that was until today, after connecting the new iPad with the supposedly original Apple lightning connector and receiving the  warning message, the iPad stop charging after reaching 27% charge. Beware, either don't buy this model or wait until Apple issues some kind of correction or update removing that verifying routine from IOS 7. Right now for me, living outside the US this is a disaster, returning the device, for me is not an option. So I will have to take my iPad to a Venezuelan authorized service center, testing and probably buying a new \"original\" lightning connector, cause if I buy the Apple care plan in the US It won't be applicable in my country."}

Desktop Windows 8 and Linux servers.\n\nIf you would have told me that I would own an iPad, I would have laughed, but I got it as a gift, so I'm definitly enjoying this, but first a few things.\n\n1) White sucks. Get black, pictures and video pops better.\n\n2) Don't just get a Smart Cover, get a smart case, so the back is protected.\n\n3) don't download a billion apps and if you enjoy a free app then buy the paid version. (it's only fair)\n\nAs for the iPad itself.\n\nAs I said, white wasn't the best choice, but it's still pretty cool. VERY heavy compared to Galaxy, but also feels much better built. The glass is smooth and slippery so it's easy to swipe around. The apps are the same, the only exception being that on Android, I could use 1Password for free and on the iPad they want 16 bucks. Needless to say I will no longer be purchasing from Agile Bits.\n\nThe rest of the review.\n\nMeh.\n\nIt's a tablet.

I work at BestBuy and people always ask me \"APPLE or ANDROID.\" Of course it depends on the user and most people who come in the store weren't technologically savvy. So, the majority of people wanted something easy to pick up and learn. Therefore, the majority of my recomendations were the iPad. I am in college and I have an internship. Both of these roles I use the iPad in. I am even using my iPad right now. I have a Macintosh computer and I found myself using my iPad for the majority of my computing needs. The iPad has also paid itself off by the cost of Text Books alone. Every book I get on my iPad saves me on average about $100. E text books are much cheaper than buying books on campus. I also have a keyboard case which they sell on Amazon for less $50.00. I use an app called Pages, which is an Apple developed app, that allows me to edit, import and export Word Documents. Not to mention its movie and music capabilities. I also invest heavily and the iPad has made my life so much easier when it comes to managing my investments and banking. Overall, the iPad has been a life saver for me and my family. Also, another great product that is a must have is a Zagg Invisible shield. They are a little difficult to put on but they have instructional videos on how to do it. Thanks for reading."}

When its time to hurry up and wait I can use this to fill in the time. The wireless is average and so is the G4 but that could just be because of the area I am in so take it with a grain of salt.  Ipad has a wide variety of Apps but not as many as I would like in the area of office like software, that is actually good quality. However if you do some searching you can find good apps that will do what you need them to do.  This acts as my kindle, laptop, notebook, scheduler, and email service all in one.\n\nIt's not perfect, trying to transfer documents and such is a little cumbersom and requres you get the right apps, but with a little bit of tweaking you can customize it to your needs. Be awair that unlike your Ipod, or a USB drive this will not show up on your my Computer (if you have Windows) and you have to go through Itunes (not a real problem) to transfer most files.  As with anything do your homework first, as this may not suit what you are trying to do but if you decide that it does I must say I am very happy with this device and hope that Apple will keep up the good work in memory and spirit of it's founder."}

An iPad is a real powerful tool. You can automate tasks, help you organize yourself, save on text messages, calls, learn through downloadble apps, etc. All this in a single item. If you're looking for a tablet to just surf the internet, listen to music, facebook, just buy something else. The power and potential of the iPad doesn't deserve to be on standby forever."}

I won't say I was anti Apple but I was trying to justify my reasons for buying the Samsung.  I got tired of hearing how good Apple is....how clear the picture is compared to Samsung etc.  so, I purchased an Apple I-pad.  I figured I still have my Samsung.  If I don't like the Apple I will return it and get my money back.\nAfter using my Apple for a few weeks now, I am totally sold on this product!  If fact I am considering a total change to Apple for all of my computer needs!  Next it will be a switch from my Dell desktop to the Apple 27 inch desktop.  I have been a Dell customer for approximately 20 years!\nApple is a more expensive way to go, but I feel it is the best way for me.  I think Apple products are very much worth the price difference..in my opinion!\nWhy have I strayed somewhat away from the review of the Apple I-pad!  I wanted to express my feelings about a company that I could care less about that changed because of 1 of their products....the Apple iPad with the Retina Display MD511 LL/A (32 GB, Wi -Fi, Black).

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B009W9BQMQ", "review": "I think this is a good product just not really what I needed it for. It really doesn't do that much more than the iphone except the display is amazing, it takes really really nice pictures, and the sound is much better than an iphone. You really don't need extra speakers unless you are using it to listen to music and have a larger living space.\nI bought it because I work online and thought it would be nice and compact to work from but better than my iphone. I NEVER work on it. I mean I can check email and all of that but it's just not a laptop. I should have passed on this and gotten one of the thin little laptops instead.\nAlso if you get one, get some kind of warranty and get a cover for it before it even arrives. It's more fragile than the iphone. I did not have a cover on my iphone when I first got it and dropped it a few times and it was fine. I was in the process of looking for a cover for this ipad and dropped it and the screen cracked. It's going to cost me at least $160 to get a new screen. The more protected it is the more places you will take it and the more use you will get out of it. I was at disney world's magic kingdom a few weeks ago and they have this amazing electric show at night. It looked like an ipad commercial. Everyone was holding up their ipads and recording it. But again I would be hesitant to haul it around without sufficient protection.\nSo the graphics are amazing and it's a fun little gadget to watch movies or play games with.\nOh I'm also in a few bible studies and the bible app is WAY better than on the iphone and you can also download books on kindle app. I do this with my bible study workbooks and you can fill it the blanks and answer questions and everything. The youtube app looks good.\nI'm not sure what else to say other than everything works and it's not defective. I just don't have a lot of money for \"toys\" so I wish I had gone with the laptop."}

At the time when I was ready to purchase the 128gb cellular version it was going for a 1000 dollars plus on this website, when apple stores and bestbuy stores were selling this for $929 plus tax. 2. Some of the reviews suggested the seller was actually sending people used iPads when paying clearly buying \"new\" products.\n\nAnyways, I love it, its fast, easy to use. You get what you basically put into it, the app store is amazing with so many things that make this ipad great. I can not believe I did not own one sooner.\n\nThe only thing I can not figure out how to do is, is be able to send multiple attachments within a email. I hope some new application or apple fixes this issue. Its easy to do one at a time, but its not efficient. It seems like a common problem and question that is asked i noticed when googling this issue.\n\nMy iPad has had none of the issues addressed earlier.

I use my MA more for computing, while the iPad (to me) is more of an entertainment device - & its screen is definitely perfect for it.  Pixelation is all but a thing of the past with this baby!

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B009W9BQMQ", "review": "I must start by informing you that I have been an Android fan since smart phones started coming around main stream. And I will also say that as a smart phone user, I will likely never leave the Android market.\n\nWhen it comes to tablets though, Apple has this race won by a long shot. Most people against Apple products complain about not having widgets, or about being \"stuck into one persons way of thinking\" with Apple's designs. Not having the customization options and whatnot.\n\nI was originally the same way, first purchasing the Nook HD+, and then exchanging it for the Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 Inch. Both of these do not stand up to the iPad.\n\nThe processor in this new iPad is SO fast, the games that would use that processing speed have not even been built yet. The screen resolution looks more amazing than some games on my 1080P screen when playing X360.\n\nThis device has changed the way I work, and the way I live. I have a mobile hotspot on my phone now, so I have this powerful device ready to go anywhere I go. Processing my workload is a breeze since my workstation now goes with me in my bag.\n\nWhat is also great is that SO many apps link between both iOS and Android. So I can update a spreadsheet on my iPad, and review it later from my phone if needed. Skype is also wonderful, which has allowed me to connect with my father in ways that have not been possible for years due to the distance between us.\n\nThere is no memory slot, so I purchased the 32GB. I do not download music or movies, so the space is only for apps, photos, etc.\n\nI am a heavy Netflix and Amazon Prime user, so I watch shows on this every day. There are also TONS of free games with incredible graphics for you to enjoy.\n\nAll in all, this is easily one of the most profitable purchases and investments that I have ever made. I am now a huge Apple fan and I am extremely excited to watch their products develop.\n\nIf you have ever considered going Apple, but thought against it because you are an Android lover, stop right here. Just make the purchase, and try it out for a week or so. If you hate it, return it, but I do not see that happening. This is my most recommended product to all friends and family that are interested in advanced progressive technology, or who want a simple and powerful device to use instead of a bulkier, slower, and less convenient computer/laptop."}

When charging, the touch screen was behaving in a very strange way. I cannot click on the icon and screen just acted very strange. It works fine when NOT charging. I brought to Apple Store since it has 90 days warranty and the staff confirmed that my iPad 4 came with a fake and faulty charger. The text on the charger also indicated 10watts and not the original 12watts. The iPad came in an original packing with USB cable but the wall charger was totally fake. I can feel the different in the material too.\n\n2. This was another disappointment for iPad4, it is thicker with bigger battery but it take like 4-5 hours for full charge from 50%. Also, when you use it for very long, the ipad get warm. I tried with different wall chargers (original 12W) and it is the same. The charging seem to take longer than the iPad2.\n\nI would stay away from iPad 4 is you are thinking of buying it for retina display.\n\nUPDATES: Contacted Amazon and the Seller. They suggested that I return the iPad4. I confirmed with Apple that iPad4 is ok and the charger need replacement. After several email exchanges, Amazon refunded me $19 so I can purchase original wall charger with 12 Watts for my iPad4. Kudos Amazon so I am giving the additional star for great customer service but not the product. Hopefully it charges faster now with 12W."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B009W9BQMQ", "review": "I purchased an iPad3 on launch day - waited in line and everything.  This was our 3rd iOS device and was my children's iPad.  Basically from day 1 they loaded up the iPad with apps of all sort, so much so that there was not enough space to get updates.  They have periodically come to me to complain about lack of wifi connectivity, I usually restarted the device and most of the time it would connect (for a time at least).  I assumed this was some sort of a software issue that would be corrected when I upgraded.  So I finally wiped off the iPad and upgraded and have only had a greyed out  wifi on switch.  We live in the great midwest nowhere close to an apple store.  I finally made a trip to Des Moines IA to take to the apple store there for service.  It is a wifi ant problem (a known issue) and the fix involved $300 to upgrade.  It is certainly my fault for not believing my kids or investigating the issue sooner.  The apple store is so well advertised as the place to go to get apple products fixed I wrongly assumed this was my only option.\n\nIf this were any other sort of problem (bluetooth issue, cracked screen etc) I would expect that to be a reasonable option for an out of warranty issue - but with a known problem?  Microsoft generated so much goodwill by fixing their known hardware issue no matter when purchased, why can' apple at least match the customer service of MSFT?  I am just asking for my kid's ipad to be fixed so they can continue to use and purchase apps.\n\nDon't make me call the tech guy to complain - THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE, I am just asking for Apple to take their billions of dollars and not stick it to a Dad trying to get his kids an iPad - does that seem unreasonable?\n\nJason Demuth\njasondemuth@hotmail.com"}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B009W9BQMQ", "review": "I bought this ipad for my wife and son to use. It is the first apple product to hit our home since the iphone 3 failure we had a few years back. So we got the ipad last night and proceeded to set it up. Everything was fine until we tried to use it. The first app we used caused the ipad to restart. So we tried again. Again 1 min into use and it restarted again. We thought, oh, maybe this thing cant download apps and use them at the same time. If that were the case I would return it for sure and not buy another because that is just ridiculous. Luckily that was not the case. The third time we tried an app we had nothing downloading, updating or anything, and it restarted again. I went to apples site to try to talk to someone about it and when I entered the serial number the site said it was out of warranty and no tech support could be used. That told me that there was an error or I was just sold a used ipad. Since amazon doesn't print the serial numbers on the receipt there is no was for me to prove I bought the ipad that same day. I then spoke to amazon about this and they said since I bought it thru a marketplace person we couldn't exchange it but had to return and buy it over. I thought fine...I will go and do that. Well, while I was on the phone the ipad timed out and went to sleep, but it wouldn't wake back up. So I called apple this morning and spoke to them about it. They told me it is possible the item was used before but there is no way for them to find out. They had me do a hard restart which made it possible for the ipad to turn on again but about 5 min after I hung up with the guy it turned off again and wouldn't turn back on. So I made my mind up. I hard restarted the thing, wiped it clean, and will mail it back Monday. Meanwhile, later today I will go to the apple store and buy one from them, brand new, with warranty. I figure this is apples 2nd strike against me. The only 2 apple items I have own were both defective, so either I have the worst possible luck or apple has fairly low quality standards. If I get a third defective product from them its over.\n\nLesson here....check the serial number on apples site as soon as you get your item."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B009W9BQMQ", "review": "There were some negative reviews of this vendor. One particular series of highly critical reviews really made me wonder if I was getting into trouble buying the newest iPAD from this vendor. The price was roughly $120.00 less than Apple's price. So I was apprehensive until the tab arrived. The tab came in unopened original packaging, arriving on time and in good condition. I own two iPad 1s and an iPAD 2, and now this iPAD with retina display. They all work just the way they should. The screen is a nice improvement. This iPAD is so thin that it is easy to misplace if you don't have it in a more bulky case (which I have now done). I am very happy and impressed with both this iPAD model and with the vendor that I purchased it through. Cant complain at all....."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B009W9BQMQ", "review": "I see that many excellent reviews about this iPad have already been entered, so I just want to point out the one thing that is most salient to me.  I've owned each of the iPads (1, 2, 3, & mini) and just received this one.  It is very obviously faster than iPad 3!  I cannot believe the number of \"professional\" reviewers on tech sites stating that they didn't really notice any difference.\n\nI was enraptured when I first obtained iPad 3, and felt at the time that the retina display ticked off my last \"needs\" box as far as tablet computing.  But as I lived with it, it became annoying waiting on its A5X to scroll in a dense webpage ----- daily so.  And the internet browsing experience is the real reason to consider upgrading to the 4 from the 3; it really is that much better.  To use one of my favorite iDevice information websites as an example, go to www.imore.com on the iPad 3, and observe the staccato, stop-and-go browsing experience as you navigate down the page.  Now, do the same on the iPad 4; it's smooth as silk.\n\nI'll still be looking for the retina iPad mini when it arrives (looks like 2014 at this rate), but other than the slight heaviness of this iPad 4, I'm completely satisfied.  Noting the never-ending march to smaller-thinner-and-lighter-yet-longer-battery-life, it's difficult to see what Apple can do to improve upon this one."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B009W9BQMQ", "review": "On the plus side the IPad has a fast charge time, long battery life, good Wi-Fi, a robust cpu, and an excellent display. That said, it's not without some flaws and annoyances. Foremost, there's no consistent method to back navigate. Perhaps, this was one of those cases where design overrules function; in order to keep the device looking elegant they sacrificed functionality. The result is confusion and inconsistency. In some cases you find yourself navigating back via the app itself; however sometimes you need to use the home function or start swiping. For example, at one point I opened a PDF that was attached to an email but then I could not easily find a way to close the PDF to return to the inbox. There's no consistency as to where the back function is to be found or what it may be called. Often you are forced to make reaches across the screen whereas if there was one consistent placement for a back function you always know where it is. The same is true for getting a list of apps running in the background. You are forced to use a awkward four finger up motion.  Why not just give us a consistent button for a list of running apps?  I found the need to use 4 finger swipes annoying.. Another missing function is the cancel key. If you accidentally start to download a huge file and want to abort - where's the key to stop the download?  The app store is annoying as you can't search for apps in ways of your choosing. Why not offer advanced search that would give you some options to sort and filter?  Another issue I have with the device is its dependence on iTunes. Certain files cannot be removed from the device unless you are on iTunes, really? Why? I should be able to delete files off my device. I'm assuming there's an app for doing that but really - why not just make that part of the OS? Speaking of what's not included - why not include a free calculator? Do I really need to shop for a basic calculator? The native Maps app is a work in progress with many roads or local features not labeled correctly. If you want to hook this device to a camera you need to purchase a special adapter but check the reviews for the adapter as many users are reporting it no longer works after the latest OS update. There's no easy way to manage your cookies in safari. In advanced setting you can either delete all cookie data or none.  It has a very nice display however I refuse to adopt Apple marketing speak and call it \"retina\" display. Don't bother thinking you'll be able to send anything to your printer unless of course you have a specific \"air\" printer that will work with the Apple iOS. I could go on but hopefully you get the point that this device has both strong and weak points."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B009W9BQMQ", "review": "I decided to take the plunge and upgrade from my old and outdated 1st Generation iPad 32 gb. I was a little worried about switching to the 16gb because of less space, but it turns out to be plenty of space since I stream my music (from google player and other services) instead of saving it directly on the device.\n\nI use the device primarily for reading, surfing the web, watching videos, and editing pictures and documents. However, since I have started using the new iPad, I use it more than my computer, and for many, many more projects. I've started listing items on eBay right from the device (which works even easier than on the computer, since it has the built-in camera). I also have been using it for many projects that require a lot of typing, as the smart case I purchased makes typing comfortable and easy. I've even started playing more games on it because of the incredible processor inside! Previously, I could only run Angry Birds and Diner Dash, as I knew they wouldn't crash (and heavier games like Infinity Blade crashed the old iPad way too often). Now I can run GTA Vice City while multitasking with eBay and email, and no lag at all!\n\nApple has really outdone itself with this new iPad -- of course, I understand that it isn't worth the plunge if you own an iPad 3. However, if you are like I was--still using the old iPad (or no iPad at all)--this is more than worth the money! Do yourself a favor and get this device!"}

I'm a hobby artist, & this is great to take around & sketch without looking like a nerd with a sketchbook & box of pencils.  I do have one gripe.  When adjusting brightness lower at night while using a reading app, the black background turns gray which actually brightens the screen. The white font also turns gray.

Excellent for surfing the web and navigating around apps.\nUser friendly.\nVery Good battery life.\nMalware free worries.\nGood speaker volumes.\nGood for game apps.\nBluetooth.\nEven pixation.\nPlenty of accessories online for it.\nFront and back cameras.\n\nCons:\nNot the best Colors even with retina display. I wish that they were as vivid as Kindle fire HD for video streaming.\nScreen loves fingerprints.\nCost more.\nDoes not support SD memory card (Only Samsung Galaxy does of the four brands that I have used).\nCostly brand power adapter. Does not use a universal power adapter like all the other brands. You can not use a universal usb micro cable to charge it from your laptop. You are sucked into buying a new brand adapter, if you forget the brand power adapter at home on a trip. Unlike the other brand tablets, you can not recharge the Ipad with a universal cigarette power adapter from your car or with a universal usb micro cable connected to your laptop. As it is the tablet is already costly enough, why make more money from users if they forget their power adapter?\n\nRecommend for surfing the web or using game apps. Not the best for online video streaming. Kindle Fire beats them all for online streaming of videos.\n\nRecommend the following products:\n1. ZAGGKeys PROfolio+ Bluetooth Keyboard for iPAD Gen 4.\n2. Skinomi TechSkin ultraclear screen protector for iPAD Gen 4."}

Just like my relationship with my smartphone, don't leave home without it.  Crystal clear on graphics.  Of course, this is my first ipad so I cannot really compare it on past experience.  Tons of apps, batteries lasts ok.  100% can last for about a day (I actually used it for about an hour every hour, and by about 9-930 pm, battery was at 15%.  Again, depending on what you are doing, it lasted me for about 2 more hours (I think).\n\nPrice was great!  Seller was AWESOME (they actually gave me a cover for this ipad as a token of appreciation for the business).  However, with that being said, if you have kids that always run around, MAKE SURE TO INVEST on a more \"military\" style case.  If you call Apple, the only thing that they could suggest was..., well sir, just buy a new one??!?  (yeah, like I have $500 bucks, spewing out from my pockets.  My response; okay let me go to my money tree and pick some bills out, goodbye!  If you go to an electronics store, make sure to have at least $200 laying around.  I broke/cracked my screen after 2 weeks!  So needless to say, a case with something covering the actual screen, yes it is a must!  No flash, no usb port, but takes good pictures and speakers are good as well.\n\nItem was shipped fast, very fast!  Definitely ordering from this person again!"}

I saw other people using their camera equipped iPads and thought I might like that and the ability to use FaceTime away from home.\nI was more than pleased with this latest version of Apple's iPad.\nThe display is amazing. I find that I use it all the time, at home as well as away from home.\nI love doing a back up in the Cloud. The transfer using Cloud from my old to new iPad was effortless. With in a couple of minutes everything I needed, apps, contacts and music was ready to go."}

She's terminally ill so does not leave home. I travel extensively for work, and therein lies the difference.\nThe tablets have no issues on home networks or well-maintained networks like at Starbucks, but can't connect to most public networks like in airports or hotels. Like most Apple products, there are no detailed error messages to help diagnose the problem. The log on pages for these networks simply don't appear.\nThere are a host of online posts complaining of this problem. Some are able to fix the issue by disabling Autofill in Safari, resetting netwok connections, etc., but others like me have met with no success. I have years of development experience and am by no means a novice when it comes to computers; the WiFi capabilities of this device are just very poorly designed."}

There are times, when traveling where it would be better to have all the time Internet connectivity and not have to hunt around for a wifi hotspot. Or definitely purchase mobile hotspot service if you get this model. This model doesn't have built in GPS like cellular model. That means if you plan on using this for GPS on the go, then you must purchase a separate gps to plug in (80-90$) and also pay for mobile wifi. So if you plan to use gps function, might be more cost effective to pay a little more up front for cellular version to save in added cost and inconvenience of hooking up this model for GPS use."}

I'm very happy with the upgrades.  Like with my old iPad I'm basically using it to surf the net, watch streaming videos/podcasts, and read books.  I don't take pictures with it or store music.  I'm also not a gamer - so I can't comment that much on the retina display - but I will say the colors are brighter and I find it easier to read books.  The big difference that I notice is in the processor.  Even with my crappy internet connection I notice a huge improvement in the speed with opening apps and streaming videos.  Battery life is longer than the iPad 2. However, because the battery is bigger on this device it takes a lot longer to charge.  I like to kill the batteries on all my electronic devices before I charge them and from a dead battery to 100% charge on this iPad it took over 8 hours to fully charge.  I wasn't using it when it was charging.  In fact, I read on a couple of review sites that this iPad will continue to charge up to 2 hours after it says it's fully charged.  My advice is to allow yourself extra time and charge it overnight if you can.\n\nAll in all I'm very happy with it.  Since I carry it with me everywhere I bought the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/OtterBox-Defender-Series-Case-with-Screen-Protector-and-Stand-for-the-New-iPad-4th-Generation-iPad-2-and-3-Pink-Alpenglow/dp/B007WPHXII/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">OtterBox Defender Series Case with Screen Protector and Stand for the New iPad (4th Generation), iPad 2 and 3 - Pink Alpenglow</a>&nbsp;for extra protection.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B009W9BQMQ", "review": "Since other people have written about the specifications and some of the advantages of the iPad tablet which I will not repeat here.  I will only say that  indeed the iPad works very well and you will be pleased with it.  I will also briefly tell you my own story to try another  tablet that left me completely unsatisfied and very disappointed: Before trying the IPad with Retina Display, I tried the most recent version of Amazon's tablet, the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" 4G LTE Wireless with 64G.\n\nThe most powerful aspect of a tablet (according to my opinion) is its ability to establish a wireless connection. Without it, it is just a useless piece of extra weight someone carries around. And, unfortunately for Amazon, the Kindle's wireless card is not working as it should be.  In my home, the tablet was loosing connection with the router continually (even when I was keeping them within 1-2 feet from each other) for unknown reasons. When the connection was on, I opened some simple web pages but the downloading was very slow. Trying to open cnn.com, the downloading was so excruciatingly slow that the tablet went to sleep on its own.... And this happened multiple times, not once.  When I took it to an area where, in order to use the net, you must accept the terms and conditions, the connection was made but the browser got confused. The connection was lost and my efforts to reestablish it got fruitless. Although I use computers and other electronic devices on a daily basis and encountering problems is not foreign to me, with the Kindle I got tired and discouraged very quickly and I returned the tablet to Amazon  30 hours after I received it. The experience with the iPad has been completely the opposite. It worked immediately. The connections are relatively fast (often restricted by the lines themselves).  There is a tremendous number of apps and work well although some of the free ones are quite annoying since they broadcast so many ads that make their use very irritating. (Incidentally: At the time I am writing this review, Amazon's app for streaming video is not working on the iPad with retina display although it was working for the previous iPad models. One cannot login to his/her prime membership!)\n\nOverall, if you are thinking to buy a tablet, I would strongly recommend to buy  an iPad. However, think well before you decide. Amazon is great in returns (and  I am a very satisfied Prime customer); it will refund your money if you do not like the Kindle. However, Apple has a restocking fee (15% at least; may even vary from store to store); hence you may loose a considerable amount of money if you decide to return the iPad."}

The only issue is that I need more memory to store videos and pictures on it, but I have options to take care of that problem by storing software on my computer and laptop so I only keep the most recent items stored on my iPad. Over all it's a great product and really, really enjoy having it."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B009W9BQMQ", "review": "I bought my first tablet computer about a decade ago and was severely disappointed with the functionality. Nothing was intuitive, everything required additional steps, nothing tied in with anything else. Today's generation of tablets has solved these issues and more. And they've done it in a way that is useful for home or business users considering tablet solutions.\n\nI now am able to run my organization's billing, reporting, presentations, and speeches from my handheld tablet. I can pair it with my iphone to control presentations remotely, or use it (in combination with special software and hardware add-ons) as a teleprompter. I haven't yet gotten to the point that I will travel without my laptop computer, but I'm getting close.\n\nOn the flip side, when I get home the iPad serves as an entertainment hub for the family, controlling our entertainment center, providing affordable gaming for the kids (or me on occasion), and connecting me with my network of friends.\n\nThe only downside is that this (in combination with the iPhone) makes it very difficult to unplug yourself and just experience life as it happens. I've walked into rooms when relatives are visiting and found every single person looking at their phones or iPads instead of chatting with each other. Of course, that may just be because we're all pretty boring."}

Excellent for surfing the web and navigating around apps.\nUser friendly.\nVery Good battery life.\nMalware free worries.\nGood speaker volumes.\nGood for game apps.\nBluetooth.\nEven pixation.\nPlenty of accessories online for it.\nFront and back cameras.\n\nCons:\nNot the best Colors even with retina display. I wish that they were as vivid as Kindle fire HD for video streaming.\nScreen loves fingerprints.\nCost more.\nDoes not support SD memory card (Only Samsung Galaxy does of the four brands that I have used).\nCostly brand power adapter. Does not use a universal power adapter like all the other brands. You can not use a universal usb micro cable to charge it from your laptop. You are sucked into buying a new brand adapter, if you forget the brand power adapter at home on a trip. Unlike the other brand tablets, you can not recharge the Ipad with a universal cigarette power adapter from your car or  with a universal usb micro cable connected to your laptop. As it is the tablet is already costly enough, why make more money from users if they forget their power adapter?\n\nRecommend for surfing the web or using game apps. Not the best for online video streaming. Kindle Fire beats them all for online streaming of videos.\n\nRecommend the following products:\n1. ZAGGKeys PROfolio+ Bluetooth Keyboard for iPAD Gen 4.\n2. Skinomi TechSkin ultraclear screen protector for iPAD Gen 4."}

My previous tablet was the original ASUS Transformer which had started to languish in the corner of my office because of its lack of screen responsiveness.\n\nThe advantages of the ASUS over the Ipad is the openness of the file system. That's my only gripe with the Ipad (not jailbroken), is that you can't just store files on the device without the use of a specific program. (Ipad users will know what I mean.)\n\nThe battery life on the Ipad is pretty impressive. With my ASUS, I would have to charge it almost every night, but the Ipad just keeps going and going. That battery capacity comes with a price, much longer charging times.\n\nOtherwise, a really amazing device that appeals to all ages."}

Though anxiously awaited the delivery time...New York to Nevada requires a degree of patience.. It did arrive two days earlier than promised.  Went immediately to the nearby Apple store for a checkup and training and couldn't have felt more intelligent with my purchase.  It worked like brand new, included 2 protective covers so saved me that add on and I spent $200 less than I expected if I went with the 16gb...and I got the 64gb with high def!!  Thank you amazon, great job once again!!"}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B009W9BQMQ", "review": "My wife went on a business trip to south-America visiting companies. She wrote all notes in the iPad. On her way back, the iPad spontaneously showed an error (without doing absolutely anything other than turn it on) \"This iPad is disabled\" and asked to wait for 45 minutes. After 45 minutes all was gone. It started as if the iPad was new. I went to the iPad store and they said that they don't know why this happened and that they have no way to recover any data. All was lost. The best they could do is to exchange it for a different one. The lost data was worth so much more than the iPad.\nI think is unacceptable that this tablet may destroy the user's data and according to the Apple store employees, there's nothing wrong with it. If the operating system has a problem, user's data should not be deleted, even if it has to start cold.\nThis is the second iPad we have and the second to fail. The first one, a first generation, just stopped charging and we had to pay Apple to exchange it for a different one.\nThe lesson we learned is that this devices may be good for music, photos or any other unimportant tasks, but to me, they are toys.\nI wouldn't rely on this tablet on anything important.\n\nUpdate: It did it again. I went to an Apple store and they exchanged it. The employee at Apple said that they never saw this failure before. I hope the replaced unit works fine, but anyway we will just trust the important notes to pen and paper."}

But...\n\nThe difference in speed is amazing. I took this with me to visit my extended family and was able to do everything I needed to do without bringing my laptop. If an app wasn't working for me, I could use a real browser (on the old iPad, safari worked, sort of, very slowly and did very little. This is a completely different tablet experience. I handed the old one down to my son, because he doesn't have to pay bills online or respond to emails that have attachments.\n\nAs for whether it would be worth it to upgrade from an iPad2? Maybe. I've played with my friend's iPad2, though, and it seems just fine. This one is noticeably faster, but you'd probably do better to wait a generation for a bigger bump.

The cost of a cover for the iPad is extremely high, and they are not well thought out designs. The iPad is not a replacement for a laptop, but it is very convenient for travel. I like the big screen.

So believe it or not,  I could not get a repair job OR replacement from that store...or any of the 4 stores in the Miami area!  How could this be I asked???  Maybe because I purchased my ipad from Amazon?  I couldn't get a straight answer from any of the folks at the store but when I asked if they actually did not have an ipad in the store to replace mine, the answer was \"warranty replacements come from a different inventory than ones for sale\".  And not one store in the greater Miami area had a \"Replacement\", according to them.  I was told my only option was to go to a UPS store, and mail it via ground to them, and then in a week or so they would send me a \"Replacement\".

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B009W9BQMQ", "review": "To print from an Ipad you need a special printer as most printers are incompatible. You must have an air printer and that usually means buying another printer. I would make sure I could print before buying an Ipad and compare it to the printing capabilities of other pads. Also you cannot add memory to the Ipad.\nFor me the Ipad ended up being a game tablet and a device to use for face time only.\nMany other pads will allow additional memory and printing."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B009W9BQMQ", "review": "Mac products are stylish and well made, but software is a limitation. This is my first mac product since I have an smarth phone with android and a toshiba laptop. Hardware on this Ipad has good performance, it has good quality screen and the processor is fast opeming apps and navigating. What I did not like is all the restrictions that one as an user has when interacting with another brand devices and even with file management. I am tech savy maybe what I am writing is not relevant for other kind of users, but I like to get full use of the things I buy. For example with ipad bluetooth sharing can only be made between mac devices. File management non existant, just media folders, among other things. This is what made me give jailbrake a try. After installing it and experiment all alternative apps it offers I felt l in heaven, now I could say that the Ipad was mine, it was freedom. If it wasn't for cydia I would have sell  the ipad for sure and go to a samsung tablet."}

I don't know what a lot of people are talking about this iPad 4 having problems connecting to their wireless Internet and crashing a lot. This hasn't happened to me once yet and I'm not saying it hasn't happened to them but it is probably their internet's fault and not the device's fault because I have like the cheapest Internet and the cheapest Internet router but mine connects fine and hasn't crashed once. So that should tell you something. This is my first iPad and the only thing I will complain about is the battery life. It is terrible but then again I'm on mine a lot since I need it so much with making YouTube videos and doing my other work on it like my poetry. This is my only computer so I rely on it a ton. It is reliable in everything else though so I just suggest that you keep a wall adapter and charger handy wherever you are."}

But can't hold much of that against Apple. They couldn't keep that old connector forever."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B009W9BQMQ", "review": "had purchased a kindle fire hd 8.9 because of the good ratings and it was about 200 less than the ipad each with the 32G memory.  I used it for about 2 weeks.  I found it not as intuitive and the learning curve, while not bad, was a bit more cumbersome to learn to use.  Also it was one more operating system I would have to understand and use. I have an iphone 5, which replace my 4.  The iphone is easy to use, all kinds of apps (though I don't use many, its nice to know they are available).  I have handle the ipad before from relatives etc and they seemed nice and all, but not much different  from the iphone and wondered why the fuss.  At the time, I just couldn't see spending the bigger bucks for the iPad.  I found out differently.  While the Kindle does everything it says it does,  I returned it and ordered this ipad.  I feel now that it is definitely worth the extra.  It has the same sharp image with the retina display as the kindle and I would say even better.  Since I travel a lot and have satelite for TV at home, I use a vulkano (like sling box) to view my DVR recordings and live tv stations from home.  The Kindle did an OK job, but the iPad is superior with that task.  the app for kindle worked, had to pay extra for it and the operating system handled it OK but every 30 to 40 minutes it would drop the connection.  The ipad app was free and rock solid, so far.  I had used the iphone for several years, and using the iPad is as comfortable with familiar icons and function.  It has a little larger screen, ease of use, more apps, and accessories than kindle which made me spring for the extra dollars.  I am very happy with my decision."}

I went from thinking I wanted a Kindle Fire and read all the reviews for both. Almost went with the Kindle BUT I am very happy I decided upon the IPad 4. My grandkids have a Kindle and so does my mother-in-law and they love it. But when my grandkids come over my house the all want my IPad. They fight over it. They say it can do so much more then their Kindle.\nIt has so many apps. It can drive you crazy. It is fast to open and surf the internet and get my email quickly.\nI am not disappointed at all. The display on the screen is fabulous. I am just trying to get use to not have favorites in a drop down menu. But it is so easy you just have to look at your history or just speak to the ipad and ask them to surf the net and they find the site for you.\nTaking pictures and sending them is so easy too. I really like that feature.\nI am not a techy person and found I could not take pictures from my camera and down load them on to my computer. With this IPad it is easy.\nWell anyway I am very happy with it and glad I made this purchase."}

I would love to get my hands on something using the android operating system to compare. One feature this has that I use a lot is voice dictation which I am using right now it makes entering data very very fast.

Slightly slower than what I expected (I am amazon prime, so I have 2 day delivery free). But that is ok.\n\nThe product was delivered in sealed condition with \"original\" package ---- at least I could not find any sign of previous usage or anything. Everything so far is so good.\n\nThen we started to initialize this Ipad. It gave me black screen for a short time, which I thought it was just normal --- probably it was loading something. And after that, it seemed to be normal all the way to the end of the setup phase. The next thing we do is to download google Chrome on it. It briefly showed a \"shaky\" \"blurred\" screen for a second or so. And then back to normal.\n\nThen we started to explore its functionality like taking pictures etc. The frequency of \"shaky\" screen by now increases. Then we tried to download some free games. After we downloaded the first free game (I do not remember which, our purpose was just testing) app, it went black. This time for 15 minutes or so. This time, I do not think it is normal any more.\n\nBut after that, we were able to restart it. Just to find that it is now a norm of showing shaky screens all the time. And then we were browsing to find apple support using it. It is then the whole thing died. It won't come back any more. So we had to send it back.\n\nI do not know who I should blame the problem to, or just unlucky to hit this one."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B009W9BQMQ", "review": "As much as I didn't want to buy another iPad for my new tablet, Apple makes great hardware and has a nice, simple, stable operating system.  If they just stuck with that I'd never leave them.  Unfortunately I love my Google also and Apple is pulling an AOL by trying to make its customers be stuck with their apps.  We'll see how that works out for them, but they lost me as an iPhone customer because of it.\n\nThat's my Apple rant :)  Moving on to the review, the 'new' new IPad, aka iPad 4, is nice and quick!  Had the original iPad and it became obsolete pretty quickly due to the small 256MB of memory - great for a game of freecell, but it couldn't hold more than a few web pages without having to do constant refreshes when you switch tabs, very annoying, hardly ever used it eventually.  Bought an iPad 3 for my girlfriend, she didn't like it and we returned it to buy $100 necklace which she loved.  Almost bought an iPad mini, cute size, then found out Apple only put in 512MB of memory - it can't handle many web pages without doing the annoying refresh thing either - already obsolete when it hit the shelves.  So iPad 4 had the nice high res screen and 1 gig of memory, still only half the 2 gigs that comparable Android tablets have, but that's why we'll all have to buy another tablet in a year or two rather than 3-4 years for any other electronic device - planned obsolescence, slightly annoying also.  I would do a Nexus 7 over the mini, but since I have an Android phone with a nice large screen (which I love compared to my iPhones), a Nexus 7 is too similar.\n\nSo long story short, I like and use my iPad 4 a lot more than I thought I would, it's still currently the best tablet as of February 2013.  The higher res screen, although not a big difference in the store, is actually really nice once you get used to it.  My MacBook Air looks old now in comparison and I'll have to upgrade that when Apple adds the Retina display on the next generation.  Web pages look great, HD apps are more available now and I even use my iPad to read with the Kindle app ... although I suspect Apple will take that away from you at some point also, ha!  Greedy, oh well.  Best of all the iPad is very quick and has great battery life so far, using mostly for web browsing and not gaming.\n\nWIFI claim of double the speed - FALSE.  One of my big factors of getting the iPad was its claim of double the WIFI speeds as I want quick internet browsing.  No one at Apple Store knows how or why it will give you this or whether it will do it without special equipment like a new router.  So here is the deal - the new iPad gets HALF, not double, the WIFI speed of my three year old 2010 MacBook Air on the same (standard 2.4mhz) high speed cable modem WIFI router.  I get about 66Mbps (speedtest.net) on my 2010 MacBook Air and only about 32Mbps on the new iPad.  Tested it every way possible and the results only get worse if you adjust your router settings.  Long story short, you need to get a new dual band (2.4mhz & 5 mhz) router if you want to get the higher claimed speed, but the claimed speed is only in comparison to prior iPads.  Essentially buying a new router and going though the pain of setting that up with your ISP is the only way to get back to the wireless speeds Apple could do three years ago on a standard 2.4mhz WIFI router.  Browsing is fairly quick and will obviously depend on your broadband connection, but to claim double and then not even equal three year old speeds is a little annoying.\n\nIn conclusion, with all the little issues that Apple makes me not like them as a company, they still do make great hardware and they have a stable operating platform.  If you are looking for a quick, smooth, full size tablet, the new iPad is hard to beat.  We'll see what the rest of 2013 has to bring.  As Android apps convert to full size tablet and HD over time, I think next year Apple will see a lot more competition.  All I want is my Google apps on my iPad, is that too much to ask for to keep me an Apple customer in the future?  Will have to go through the hassle of jailbreaking this to be able to make Chrome my default browser and then Apple will not allow updates, slightly annoying.  But, yes, it's a really nice tablet otherwise."}

I was not disappointed, but what really amazed me was amazing the web(facebook, internet reading etc...) look on this device. it is crystal clear and so much easier on the eye than my laptop or iphone. it's literally the perfect size. photos look exactly like what they are supposed to look like. I also love this model as it's the \"budget\" model with the smallest hard drive and no phone service. i just hook it up to wifi and i'm set.

The ipad4th generation has an issue with Wi-Fi, if you don't believe me or if you are skeptical just Google it and it will appear right away. It is not my intention at all to harm apple, in fact I plan to return my ipad4 and buy an ipad3 because it was perfect.\n\nAlso, Just to let you know, after I received my ipad4 I sold it and bought another one just to discover it had the same problem with Wi-Fi.\n\nApple made a huge mistake with their new generation ipad4, and they should either fix the problem or stop selling the unit. The new ipad will disconnect every 5-15 mins constantly! It's terrible, it will make you angry, frustrated ,and this is far from what you would call quality.\n\nIt's your money and your call, just don't say I didn't warn you.

For this it deserves 5 stars. As an owner of the \"New iPad, aka iPad 3rd generation,\" however, I feel that Apple did an injustice to those who purchased it.\n\nThe previous version was released to much fan fair in March 2012. This version was released a mere 7 months later, in October 2012. When I called Apple to find out why they would release a newer version so soon after the previous one, the representative who I spoke with informed me that there were problems with the 3rd generation, and as a result, Apple removed it from the market and introduced the generation 4.\n\nI have no problem with the fact that technology constantly changes, and that computers are outdated in short order. What I have a problem with, is the fact that Apple prematurely introduced the 3rd generation of the iPad knowing full well that it wasn't ready to be sold. While Tim Cook was onstage last March promoting the 3rd generation of the iPad as the most revolutionary product ever offered by Apple, he knew that it was just a stop-gap measure until the components were ready for the model that you see here.\n\nI love Apple products and have always thought that the company treated their customers in the highest regard. As a result of the above, I now feel differently about the company, not the products. As of this writing, Apple sells the iPad 2 and the iPad with Retina Display, aka the 4th generation. They do not sell the 3rd generation at all, as the one listed here is what the 3rd generation was supposed to be. I feel that this is very deceptive on the part of Apple and believe that owners of the now obsolete 3rd generation model should be given the option, for a fee to upgrade to the model presented here. I spoke with customer relations at Apple regarding the above and was told that this would not be an option. They readily agreed that there were \"issues,\" with the 3rd generation model, but refused to tell me what they are. In this regard, they are certainly not being very transparent to their loyal customers.\n\nSo, the bottom line is that the iPad with Retina Display is a marvelous device, however owners of the previous generation got screwed. I'm giving the model presented here 5 stars, because that's what it deserves. On the other hand, if I had the option to grant stars to the way Apple treated owners of the previous version, I would give them just 1 star."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B009W9BQMQ", "review": "Let me start by saying that the mediocre rating on this product had nothing to do with the seller I went through.  I had several issues with the product when I first received the iPad, starting with a small issue of the home screen button not functioning properly.  This was then compounded into a larger issue by the Apple \"genius\" not being such of a genius and replacing my iPad with a new ones and not swapping my SIM card (this was after a 3 hour wait at the Apple store).  After several more hours on the phone with both Apple and Verizon, I was finally able to get them to over-night me a new SIM card and thought everything should be fine... wrong.\n\nThe big issue I am now having is a \"No SIM card\" error, which I clearly do have as evidenced by the SIM card in my iPad.  I have done some Google searching and have noticed that many others are having the same issue.  My iPad will work great for some time and then give me that error and no longer let me connect to the internet through my Verizon service.\n\nAll in all, when the iPad is working, its amazing, however when you pay >$700 for an item you expect it to work perfectly without having to lose hours of your time at the Apple store and on the phone.  The customer service Apple has provided to me during this time is also making me rethink my switch to Apple products."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B009W9BQMQ", "review": "I have had an iPad 1 for about 2 years.  With the apps that I use through the Apple store, I have gotten more than enough use out of it.  The iPad 2 was not enough of a generational jump without upgraded graphics, and the iPad 3 wasn't enough because of the resolution of the camera.  However, this model is truly a wonder and it will be with me until iPad 8 comes out, I suppose.\n\nThe integrated camera has excellent resolution, as does the video.  The processor is perceivable faster for graphics intensive games such as those by Gameloft, EA Sports and the like.  Sound seems to have improved, as well.\n\nAlthough the latest rendition uses a different port from the predecessors, it's easier to use since either orientation will work.  It does essentially make my accessories, though, obsolete.  That means a new speaker dock, car charger and whatever else I may need.  However, I have become accustomed to using Bluetooth peripherals making connectivity more seamless.\n\nOperation is pretty much identical, and then there's Siri.  I find limited use for Siri since I have a Wifi-only iPad.  I can type faster than hold the Home button to talk, and voice recognition is ok.  Not great.  I can touch type must faster than Siri can understand me and react.  However, I'll give it more time.\n\nThe housing is as small as iPad 2 and 3.  Battery life is essentially the same since Bluetooth and Wifi are always on with a 75% brightness.  The volume control is responsive.\n\nSince I have over 1200 apps, I'm pretty much stuff with Apple.  That is the main reason I haven't considered other operating systems, apart from the Kindle Fire.\n\nOverall, I'm pleased.  If you don't have an iPad, this is finally the one.  If you're waiting to upgrade from iPad 1 or 2, then it's a no-brainer.  iPad 3 is certainly not that much behind.  Intuitively, I prefer to have a jump in processing, graphics, sound and resolution before I plan to update, again.\n\nI love this device.\n\nTwo thumbs up.\n\nUpdate:\n\nI decided to jump up in memory to the 128 GB version.  Music, movies and applications take up a lot of memory.  Aside from the jump in memory, there are no discernible changes in operation or battery life."}

I love my sister's iPad, my son's and others', but mine won't stay connected to wifi.  I tried to troubleshoot using Apple's website, called AppleCare several times, and ultimately sent the iPad to AppleCare for repair.  But my iPad still doesn't work.  In the same locations that my iPad is nonfunctional, I can use my sister's iPad (she has the iPad w/retina display, too, and I set hers up the same as mine) with no wifi connectivity issues.  But every time I try to access the internet, I get the message that my iPad is not connected to the internet. I go to settings, select the wifi connection, and if it connects at all, it's only briefly.  This happens not just with my home router, but at my place of employment and other wifi access public places (where other iPad users report no difficulty and I have no problems with my laptop, etc.). The AppleCare folks sent my iPad back in 2 days (fast service but the porblem is not solved) with a form letter that states my iPad meets Apple's specifications for acceptable performance. Unfortunately, it doesn't meet my standards. I have a $700+ lemon. I know the Apple iPad is amazing when it works (and it usually works, according to the vast majority of reviews). If Apple replaces this lemon with an iPad that actually works, I will update my review accordingly.\n\nUpdate-1/13/13: I spoke with AppleCare again and was instructed to send the iPad back for maintenance--this will be the second time. Why should I expect it to work this time? What a a waste of time! Another week+ without a functional iPad. If the problem persists after this encounter with AppleCare, I was told the iPad would be replaced. I am becoming more disillusioned with Apple. I have had experience with other iPads and know they can be wonderful when they work, so I would not advise against buying this iPad. But purchase with the knowledge that there is a significant problem with wifi connectivity attested to by many consumers on Apple's own discussion forum. I'm thoroughly frustrated with this lemon and my experience with AppleCare!\n\nUpdate-1/28/13:  After a few returns for maintenance without improvement in performance, Apple replaced my new iPad with a refurbished one. It connects to the internet, but is slow.  I've updated my router, called my wifi provider, and it's still the same.  If I could, I would return this one. One of the big selling points of the iPad is the ease of use and mine has been anything but easy to use with this wifi connectivity issue. Another big selling point is the fast connection speed--not so for me.  I would have been far happier with a netbook and completely regret this purchase."}

The screen on this iPad is incredible! It totally blows away my HDTV.\nThe 4th generation iPad also offers an overall speedier response than the 3rd generation model, along with the tiny new Lightning connector instead of a traditional 30-pin type. If you have a lot of peripherals that fit the older connector, you will need to a buy an adaptor if you want to keep using them\nI find myself using the iPad for roughly 80% of the activities that I used to do on my laptop. It is now my first choice for web browsing, and it is great for reading e-books. And it is more and more often my preferred way to watch movies and TV programs.\nBefore buying, I compared this iPad to other high-quality tablets such as the 10-inch Nexus. As far as the displays go, the iPad was the clear winner. If the quality of the graphics is high on your list of priorities for a tablet, the 4th generation iPad is far and away the best choice."}

I debated between the iPad 4, mini, Nexus 10, Transformer Prime, and Kindle Fire HD 8.9 (and the Surface tablet for about 5 seconds) and ended up going with the iPad. Here are my thoughts after a month with the iPad and testing the other tablets.\n\nPros\n1. Smooth user experience - I have a Galaxy S2 for my phone and had a 3GS before that, and though Android for phones is comparable to iOS, the iPad and iOS are seamlessly integrated to optimize load times, switching between apps, etc. while Android tablets sometimes lag\n2. Battery life\n3. More apps optimized for tablet / high resolution - everything on the mini looked fuzzy in comparison\n\nCons\n1. Weight - iPad is heavier than the Nexus 10 and more than 2x the mini\n2. iOS is probably better suited for phones than for tablets, where android's customization / widgets would make for a better user experience\n\nThe iPad has met my expectations. It's not perfect - lighter and more customization would be nice, but it's best in class for 2012, till the next set of product launches."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B009W9BQMQ", "review": "And landed right on ME! LOL!\n\nWhat wasn't really funny is the fact that I purchased the Newest, 4rth Generation IPad, the 64GBS Version, White, Standard-sized, with the Retina Display screen, and Siri onboard; and I guess, ready to \"speak\", but I won't ever know now, as I am having to return it, and fortunately for me, through a 2nd Party Buyer. Why is THAT a \"Plus\", in my favor? Because another large, corporate entity, that DOES stand behind their customers, will be behind me on the return of this Defective IPad, and literally, right out of the box! The Second Party ALSO, has deemed it \"defective\", formally, which will help.\n\nIn short, I charged this brand new, IPad, for 12 hours straight, and it only went to 83% battery charge. after 14 hours of continuous chsrging, from TWO different charging stations, ( I also have an Ipod Touch, but that's for later. ) it only reached 95% charge, if NEVER reached a Full Charge, and this is on it's first one! No \"lighting bolts\" in battery, for me to see! I have since packed it up, and am awaiting the \"call-tag ALREADY marked as \"defective\" from the Secondary Partner with Apple, and then I am sending it back ASAP! whether the trouble is the battery, or something technically more involved, I am NOT going to be the one left hanging with it THIS time!\n\nThree months ago, I bought my first Apple Product ever, and it was the IPod Touch, also in White, and also the 64GBS-version. It also was my first mp3 player, but I waited more than 3 years to finally decide to get it, as I have had problems with JUST how expensive Apple Products are, but if they work well, after all, \"they\" are the industry standard for the best there is. PLUS, they DO have their own network, IOS, which was very important to me, as well, At any rate, I got the IPod Touch, and it took 3 times, AND a Senior Technician, to get me on-line with the thing, and I told him THEN, that it shouldn't have been that difficult to get it to sync with my in-home wifi. It hadn't been with my other devices, including my workhorse computer. They are supposed to be such \"user-friendly\", people, with a Customer Service Center, and assistants, that are purported to be the best in the world. That is what I have been told, what is advertised the world over, and I have had some friends who have gotten Apple Products themselves, down through the years, and they have sworn by them, mostly. I FINALLY decided to make the leap, and get the Touch. It gave me NOTHING but problems, also right out of the box, and they just started with the problems with the initial set up. There were several others, and within the first two months of owning it, it went into Repair 4 times in turnaround shipping, they had it in their possession MORE than I did! On the fifth trouble call, and me madder than a wet hornet, I FINALLY got myself a Senior Advisor there, who took stock of the several complaints ALREADY lodged, and documented, mind you, and got me a Replacement IPod Touch, and........ It worked like a charm, also right out of the box, and it still is! The thing was, you see, it wasn't defective in the First Place! It has been working just fine, since I was issued it, and thank heaven's for that Senior Tech, as I am NOT sure that Apple Care wouldn't have left me hanging in mid-air, with the original IPod Touch, and I really think that they would have. I have come around a bit since THAT experience about not only Apple's Customer Service, but also concerning Apple's Quality Control Standards! What the heck is up, with that?\n\nAfter that fiasco, WHY was I willing to buy the New IPad? Because it was supposed to be a \"second computer/backup\" which it technically can be, btw, businessman even use them. It also is very portable, and also supposedly, easy to work with. Of course, I won't ever know that now, as I am having to return THIS one due to defectiveness right out of the box. It certainly HAS had an effect on me, I am waiting until AFTER the first of the year, either in January, or even February, before I make another move about getting something for my computing needs, and choices. I WON'T go through THIS mess again, I can tell you that! Besides, what were the odds that the same type of thing would happen to the same person, with TWO DIFFERENT APPLE PRODUCTS? I thought astronomical, that's WHY I took the chance on the purchase of the IPad.\n\nWhich only goes to show, there are \"Bad Apples's that DO Fall From the Apple Tree\", and sometimes, lightning DOES strike in the same place! My question in all of this remains, Apple, wha?????????\n\nLynnLuv59"}

I've always heard Apple was user friendly and intuitive  ----NOT.  Especially not their tablet.  File transfers from computer to tablet (iPad) very cumbersome.  Can't just drag and drop from MAC or PC over the network.  Have to go through multistep process with iTunes.  Have to transfer photos in albums.  Once you transfer you can't delete just one photo from the iPad.  You have to delete the whole album, go to your MAC or PC (if iTunes program on your PC works like Apple says it is supposed to - mine doesn't), make a new album with all but the one photo you want to delete from your iPad, sync the album back to the iPad.  On other tablets, just access the network and delete or drag and drop the desired files.  So getting on your home wi-fi network with your iPad only allows you to get on the web.  Doesn't allow you to access the directories of other computers and transfer files with drag and drop or cut and paste or use most printers on the network (only Air printers) like other tablets, desktops or laptops can.  All work arounds seem cumbersome and are not intuitive.  Also, since iPads have no SD slots or USB ports that support thumb drives, Apple forces you to by the most expensive memory there is - the built in memory that comes with the iPads when you buy them and can't be changed.\nSurprised and disappointed in Apple"}

I've never been one to indulge on technology, but folks... This is worth it. I know apple is confusing, but if you take the time, and look up iPad tips ion the App Store, you will find something for everyone: a businessman doing proposals on the run, a secretary taking notes at a function, your 2 year old who needs a distraction... Hands down one of the best products on the market. You will not regret this purchase."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B009W9BQMQ", "review": "This product is amazing. It's not perfect, but considering that I'll have it for at least 2 years and I've used it every day so far, I certainly get my $.40 worth each day! It's very sturdy and I know it will hold up well, as my other Apple products have. I have friends who still use their original iPads (they work just fine, but many applications don't run on the operating system). I have a Kindle (an old version), and still love my Kindle as a reader. It's the only way I can read in the sunlight and it's SO lightweight. Eventually, I'll upgrade to a new Kindle reader, but I see them as having different purposes. The iPad is a mini computer, and the non-Fire Kindle is the equivalent of carrying around a book (or a thousand).\n\niPad 3 vs. iPad 4:\nI purchased the version right before this one--the iPad 3--several weeks before the announcement of this version. I called Apple a few days after the announcement, and they immediately set me up with a way to return the iPad 3 to repurchase the newest version. I realize that some people were angry about the announcement, but there has to be a cut off date for new technology at some point, and I thought that Apple treated me as well or better than I've seen from any other technology company.\n\nYes, both the iPad 3 and 4 have very crisp, clear screens (which are stunning for video quality compared to my Macbook from 2010). However, the increased speed of the iPad 4 makes the video quality seem clearer. It's difficult to explain, but movies definitely got a bit crisper. Also, the increased speed really is incredible when opening apps and running a lot at once. I'd say the time it takes to open large applications is cut in half. But, I was so impressed with the iPad 3 when it came, and if I hadn't been able to exchange it, I would still give it a 5-star review--it's definitely not \"obsolete.\"\n\nFinally, what makes the iPad special? First, no one *needs* one. But now that I have one, it's sure useful and I wouldn't want to go back to life before I got one. Here's why:\n* I sit at school or at work in front of a computer all day. I am always typing or reading on the screen. Coming come to something different is nice--it's refreshing. I'd rather watch a tv show on a 10\" iPad than any other non-TV device (laptop, tablet, phone, etc.). The picture quality is great for movies and browsing, and the 10\" screen is big enough to share if a friend and I want to watch something together. A 7\" isn't enough for that or big enough to basically serve as a TV replacement.\n* It is functional enough to REPLACE a computer. Don't get me wrong, I still need my computer for editing files, serious typing, spreadsheets, etc. But right after I got the ipad, I went on a 10-day trip. No computer, no problem. I could take care of all of my emails from work and school, keep in touch, keep up with my finances, etc. It was anything I'd need for a non-work trip. Web browsing works just as well as a laptop for 95% of sites, and there's an app for many that even improves the browsing experience.\n* Given the first two points, I think owning an iPad will greatly extend the life of my laptop. I probably use my laptop 50% less now that I have an iPad, so I'll probably get an extra year of life out of my laptop as a result. That, in itself, makes the purchase of an iPad worth it in my eyes.\n* Integration with other Mac devices. This doesn't apply to everyone, but if you're a Mac user for a laptop or an iPhone, I'd highly recommend the iPad over alternatives, even if it's more expensive. If you're hooked on Windows products or Google products, I'd consider those devices.\n* The number of apps. I know that apps are everywhere these days, but, it seems at least, that there are still the most applications for Apple devices. The difference is especially noticeable in non-retail applications. For example, I've tried dozens of \"to do\" and organizer apps, and my favorite, Errands, is only available on iOS. Another of my favorites, Fotopedia Heritage (a gorgeous display of UNESCO World Heritage photography), is only on iPad. So far (and this may change), a lot of companies also choose to release new iOS versions of applications first. This edge will decrease with time, but for now it is still a significant \"plus\" for an iPad over other tablets for those who are into applications. Also, I can run most iPhone apps on the iPad, and there's an easy way to tell the difference (e.g. you can search just for iPad apps or for iPhone/iPad/iPod apps). Not sure if you can do this on other tablets, but I've found it useful (e.g. my bank only has an iphone app, but I can still run it on my iPad). Finally, though, just to be clear, this is NOT just a device for running applications. I could do almost everything I choose to do through applications just by using a web browser.\n* The number of accessories. Many won't care about this, but some will. If you like to have cases to protect your electronics, the sheer number for iPad is a draw (not a huge one, but the sprinkles on the cake). Everything's out there, from cheap plastic covers to the smart cover (the one that folds as a stand) to professional-looking leather folios to designer soft zip cases. It can be a fashion statement, but it's more likely just a way to make sure to keep your device safe.\n* Finally, and this may be petty, but it's the most professional device. In the field I know (law), partners at law firms and federal judges use iPads, not other devices to read briefs, send emails, etc. I've never seen anyone doing work on a Kindle device and I've never even seen another tablet in a professional setting. Part of this may be that it's a well-established product, and part may be that the 10-inch screen is nice for reading, even if it's bulkier. Being able to feel comfortable that you can carry your device in a professional environment may matter for some, and the iPad definitely delivers above other devices there."}

I bought this exact model yesterday and I have just one problem.  I can't put it down!\n\nI did a side by side comparison with my old iPad and it's like holding a rotary phone next to a smartphone.  No comparison.  Until I started using this new model yesterday, I didn't think I was missing anything but I was wrong.  So what are you waiting for?  Go buy one and see for yourself!\n\nSetup took no time because I regularly use iTunes and was able to replicate all the contents from my old iPad to my new one.  I think my hubbie might have to have one too so he can enjoy it once in a while.  Prying it out of my hands is outta the question.  :D\n\nI recommend a Satellite wireless external Hard Drive and a leather cover with pro Bluetooth keyboard and a 2 yr extended warranty.  I figure by then, there will be something new to buy anyway.\n\nI might just go back to reading books now too.  Any excuse to use this baby.  ;)"}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B009W9BQMQ", "review": "My first apple product was a shuffle that I won as a door prize years ago. I used it often & it held up well. I still have it but used my phone's mp3 instead. I got this iPad as a gift with purchase from a local jeweler, I paid for the upgrade from 16 GB to 64. I was disappointed to learn that the only memory I could ever have was the one that was installed. I had been considering purchasing an Asus transformer 700, that has endless possibilities for expandable memory. I like the iPad but I was hoping that the display would be easier to look at outside. I live in Tennessee & it is sunny nearly every day. Still, it's winter & the sun in lower & weaker than it is in summer. Maybe if I can reduce the glare it will be better. I like the portability and have seen reviews saying it is like a brick because it's too heavy, that's silly. If you think that, you might need to hit the gym."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B009W9BQMQ", "review": "I own a MacBook and our household owns 3 Ipod Touch devices, and I made the mistake last year in buying the Nook Tablet.  It was ok, but I really didn't use it much because it was a pain to even access web pages, just clumsy overall.  So I plunked down the cash this year and took to leap.  I bought this IPad on Black Friday from the Apple store and it is getting heavy use every day at my house.  Here are the pros and cons:\n\nPros-\nAwesome Retina display- this is pretty nice.  I wouldn't say it was a selling point, but is nice to have.\nNice chip- this has the newest chip in it, and you can't get that with the mini.\nApps- I love the apps.  My Nook was a joke compared to the immense amount of choices I have now.\nGreat for kids- My 4 year old loves it...and I mean LOVES it.  There are so many good free apps for her to learn with.\nVoice dictation- This is it folks.  This was where I dropped the extra $130 or whatever.  You can build documents just speaking.\nLightweight- it feels really good as all Apple products do.\nCharge time- I run this thing all day long and just plug it in at night.\nCapabilities- I feel like I am just scratching the surface, seriously.\n\nCons-\nHandling- You need a case, absolutely.  I bought an Otterbox Defender.  This thing almost hit the floor 2 times when I got it.  It is just slippery and is pretty solid so one wrong shift of weight and it might fly out of your hands.\nI have no other complaints."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B009W9BQMQ", "review": "The 8in Apple iPad Mini was eagerly anticipated, but the new 10in iPad 4 (or iPad with Retina Display as Apple insists on calling it) is a surprise as it arrives only nine months after its predecessor the iPad 3.\n\nExternally, the iPad 4 looks and feels identical to its predecessor. Although it is sturdy and slim, it's still the same weight at around 650g. I had hoped for a reduction in weight since the iPad 3 was around 50g heavier than the iPad 2. The battery lasted 12 hours when I was playing videos matching the time achieved by the smaller iPad Mini.\n\nThe 10in screen still has the same 2,048x1,536 pixel resolution. It's very sharp and bright with exceptional image quality, especially when compared to lower resolution tablets like the iPad Mini. Only the upcoming Samsung Nexus 10 Android tablet will have a display potentially capable of matching it.\n\nAll the changes are on the inside rather than the outside. The A6X dual-core processor is twice as fast as the iPad 3's A5X chip, but this will make little real difference until apps are designed to take advantage of it. Apple will doubtless release features in future versions of iOS that will only run on the A6X, but that has yet to happen. The iPad 4 is thankfully compatible with the recently launched EE LTE network.\n\nHD Facetime\nI was pleased with Video chatting and that the front-facing camera now records in 720p resolution which gave better, more accurate-looking video although the speed of my broadband connection did also affect image quality.\n\nThe iPad 4 may be a modest upgrade over its predecessor but it's still the best 10in tablet so far, which says just as much about the competition as it does about Apple's tablet. It's still relatively heavy though, so lighter tablets such as the iPad Mini will be a better buy for some.\n\nHere are the Tech Specs for those who don't know----\n\nHardware:\nHeight 9.5 inches\nWidth 7.31 inches\nThickness 0.37 inches\nWeight 1.44 pounds\nColor Silver / Black, Silver / White\nSpeakers Mono\n\nDisplay:\nScreen size (diagonal) 9.7 inches\nTechnology IPS LCD\nResolution (X) 2048 px\nResolution (Y) 1536 px\nPPI 264\nTouchscreen type Capacitive\nMultitouch Yes\n\nSoftware:\nOperating system iOS\nLaunch OS version 6\nMedia streaming AirPlay\n\nProcessor:\nCPU brand Apple\nCPU model A6X\nClock speed 1.4 GHz\nCores 2\n\nMemory:\nRAM size 1 GB\n\nStorage:\nInternal size 64 GB, 32 GB, 16 GB\n\nConnectivity:\nWi-Fi Yes\nWi-Fi support 802.11n, 802.11g, 802.11b, 802.11a\n802.11n frequencies 5GHz, 2.4GHz\nBluetooth Yes\nBluetooth version 4.0\n\nFront Camera:\nEffective pixels 1.2 megapixels\nVideo resolution 720p\nVideo framerate 30\n\nRear Camera:\nEffective pixels 5 megapixels\nFocus type Autofocus\nVideo resolution 1080p\nVideo framerate 30\n\nPorts:\nVideo out Yes\nHeadphone 3.5mm\nData connections Lightning\n\nSensors:\nSensors Ambient Light, Gyroscope, Accelerometer\n\nBattery:\nCapacity 42.5 Wh\nRemovable No\nQuoted use time 10 hr\n\nThis is the best tablet out there so far!!
