{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "My co-worker got it a couple of weeks ago from Amazon and I was super impressed with it. I didn't want to wait the 2 weeks to order so I went into Walmart and luckily they had one left.  There is a difference with the one from Walmart -- it's $50 more but you get 4GB instead 2GB and 200mb of T-mobile Data each month.\n\nIf you don't need mobile data then there really is no difference with the Amazon model.  We have compared our two models and loading browsers/running apps do not slow this sucker down. By the way I got about 12 hours of usage on it with a single charge!\n\nIf you are on the fence with this one or the HP Chromebook 11....  if you care about performance and speed/battery life. This one is it!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "I bought this computer to replace my aging Macbook Pro.  It's an awesome machine, with very fast bootup, the high level of built-in security from ChromeOS, powerful Intel processors.  I have been touch-typing for my whole life and a good keyboard is a MUST for me -- this one is great to type on.  It doesn't have all the Google-designed subtle features of the HP Chromebook 11, but unfortunately I have to do without those to get the bigger screen, more RAM, SD card reader, and Intel instead of ARM processor.  Note, I purchased the version of this computer with 4 GB RAM instead of 2, and built-in T-Mobile 4G service."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "I just bought the 4G version of this for fifty more at the local W-Mart.  The other big difference between that model and this one is that the version with the roaming T-mobile data plan (free for 2 years) also has 2 GB more memory so theoretically the machine should be faster than the wi-fi only version.\n\nI'll review the things in common however.\n\nScreen:  Good size, easy to adjust brightness with dedicated up and down keys at the top of the keyboard (just like Apple).  I'm reading that the Chromebook 11 version has a nicer display and that the 11 was actually co-created with Google vs. the 14 which was supposedly designed solely by HP.\n\nAppearance:  I got the machine in white.  Snow White to be exact.  It looks awesome on the kitchen counter.  The aluminum cover around the keyboard looks great and reminds me of much more expensive Apple machines.  (OK I'll stop mentioning Apple, the whole darn thing reminds me of a $1500 Apple in appearance)\n\nSpeakers:  I'm listening to Pandora as I type this.  Zero bass response but speakers still sound decent for listening to music, but if you want bass, this is NOT the machine for you.  There is a headset jack.\n\nConnections:  Speaking of jacks, there are two USB ports on the left and one on the right. There's also a HDMI output on the left so you can stream video and audio to your TV.\n\nUsability:  No, you can't easily run Microsoft Excel and Outlook on this machine.  I've read you can remote into your networked desktop and use them there but I haven't used that.  However Gmail and the Google cloud based equivalents of the Office Suite are fine.  This machine starts up almost instantly... it's like turning on a phone.  You turn it on and moments late you are checking gmail and Facebook and surfing the web.\n\nI wouldn't want this as my only computer as I do need a non-cloud based computer as well, but as an inexpensive mobile computer I find this a great alternative to my iPad at half the cost.\n\nI asked Amazon if they will be selling the 4G version of this and really didn't get a definitive answer but I'm guessing since WM is already \"live\" with it that they have some sort of an exclusive deal for now.\n\nAlso, rumor has it that Toshiba and Asus will be coming out with Chrombooks for the holidays so you might want to wait to see what they offer.\n\nMy biggest concern about this model was the 2 GB of memory in the wifi only version...  the reviews of other Chromebooks I've read (and I've read dozens) indicate to me that Chrome really operates best with 4 GB if you like to have lots of open tabs.\n\nA great little machine!!!"}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "This review is intended for those who have a Macbook, but who are interested in getting a less expensive mobile machine they can use with ease, like a Mac, but without the worry of an expensive Macbook that could get lost or damaged.  At $349, the HP 14 Chromebook is the perfect solution.\n\nThe HP 14 Chromebook also comes with 200MB of free 4G T-Mobile Data each month - for two years - not a lot of data, but if you're not at home or at a hotspot and need to check something out, this is a nice feature.\n\nBack to basics - The 4G 14 HP Chromebook feels, looks, and acts a lot like a MacBook. In some respects its even easier since the whole OS is the Chrome browser.  There are settings but they're pretty easy to figure out, so its really quick to acclimate to the differences.\n\nThe keyboard is excellent and the keys have a nice rubbery texture feel - a good thing, no complaints.  The trackpad is a bit wacky at times and it can indiscriminately click on something as you guide the cursor across the screen.  It also isn't perfect at highlighting, but its not bad.  There are also some limited gestures - two finger swipe to the next page and two finger drag up and down.  I have also stumbled onto a CTRL - two finger swipe that enlarges and minimizes the onscreen display - kinda like the MacBook pinch and expand gesture.  Its very sensitive, but it works and I use it often.  DIdnt find any documentation on it btw, but it does work.\n\nThe outside surface behind the monitor is a white matte finish (white on my machine) and there is a 1 (or so) silver HP logo in the middle.  The matte finish is a bit shiny from the oil on fingertips.  I haven't tried cleaning it yet because Im a bit apprehensive on what would work best, but its not really too noticeable except at an angle, so Im waiting.  I also like the white bezel around the screen and it has a small silver logo centered on the bottom edge.  The bezel also has a thin 1.5 rubber bumper on each side and a long 12 rubber bumper along the top with a the web cam mounted in the lid.  Going with the Google pastel colors, I have a high tech yellow bandage over the web cam, so no opinion re its quality/use.  The screen itself is good from most angles, but I notice a negative type image at extreme angles.  That said, I don't look at the screen at extreme angles, so its not really a big deal unless Im trying to show someone something.  The area around the keyboard is silver, it looks like metal and feels good so although I cant imagine why it isn't white, but it is silver on all the models - wonder why? haha  The bottom of the laptop is a white textured rubbery coating and it still looks like new almost a month later, because there are four rubbery feet that lift it off the desk.\n\nThe left side (back to front) has a Kingsington lock point, HDMI port, two USB ports, an audio in/out jack and an LED on light. On the right side are (back to front) power port (with a 90 degree angle plug), an SD Card slot, a USB port, and the 4G mini card slot (which came installed and preconfigured).  The bottom has nine screws and four rubbery feet. There are two audio slots and two perforated heat screens (molded into the body).\n\nOverall the laptop has a great feel, solid, and gives the impression of quality.\nThe 4GB memory, which is only on the 4G model, also handles video/multiple windows without any noticeable impact (unlike the 2GB memory model I had before - an 11 Samsung).\n\nWhen I first got the Chromebook, I was a little bit apprehensive about its capabilities and although it isn't a powerhorse like a MacBook, it is certainly capable of handling day to day needs and it has become a fast friend that filled a gap in my mobile needs.  My vision is much better suited to the 14 screen and I like the real estate to spread out as well. I also don't like the portable keyboards used with tablets, so the full size keyboard of the Chromebook is a a big bonus as well.\n\nGoogle Chrome offers a dock along the bottom to position your favorite apps (I haven't figured out how to relocate it to the side or even if it can be).  A couple nice features about the browser are that you can click and drag a tab to create a new window and you can also drag a window to the side and it will auto-anchor it.  That last feature however, gets in the way sometimes if you're trying to set up two windows side by side. But, its no big deal.\n\nApps\n\niCloud works well on the Chrome browser and Im also able to use the beta versions of iWork, although when I open those apps, I get a disclaimer that they may not be fully functional in my browser - none the less, they seem to work well.  iCloud mail, also works without any problems.\n\nThe Chrome Web Store offers a lot of apps that, like the AppStore allows you to use them for free.  I don't even know if they have ANY that cost or at least I don't remember seeing any.  I originally thought the Android apps would work on a Chromebook, but it was just a misunderstanding - they do not.\n\nBefore I close I also wanted to say that I also considered going to a full feature Windows machine, but I thought going to Chrome would be a lot easier than learning Windows 8 and that was a good decision. Along with the free software, automatic updates, and built in security with everything going through Google, Chrome OS is a great alternative to Windows, Chrome is easy to learn, no drilling down to get to settings, so even if you don't know where something is, its not that far removed.  Overall Chrome OS is great and if you're looking for a second computer to supplement your Mac, join the Chrome cloud, I seriously doubt you would be disappointed, its turned out to be a very nice computer."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "I had high hopes for this laptop.  I already knew the differences between a chromebook and a typical PC, so no issues there.\n\nI picked up this system from Walm*** a few days ago.  The model I purchased also includes 2 years of Tmobile data.\n\nI specifically choose the HP 14\" model because of its quality and size.  Much better size than the competing 11.5\" systems.  Also, true to HP, nice quality.\n\nSize, speed, quality, keyboard, trackpad are all great.  If I had one negative it would be the lack of lighted keyboard.  On the plus side, the system I received has 4 GB ram, so an upgrade from the 2 GB listed on Amazon.  This system fits its intended use perfectly."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "Ordered this somewhere else before it was available here.  I like the fact that the $349.00 came with a T-Mobile Sim card for 4G connection anywhere in the contiguous US.  But, it is limited to only 200MB a month which is fine if you mostly connect using wi-fi.  Aside from that, it is a Chromebook and you can do all Google related functions without issue.  Boot up time is swift and I don't worry about virus/malware issues that I had with previous Windows based pc/laptops in the past."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "I just purchased this Chromebook and i would recommend it to any of my family or friends.  The battery life is better than any high end laptop i have ever had and due to the very streamlined OS it processes things just as fast as most higher end laptops.  The build quality is also very nice equal to laptop around twice the price. If a Chrome OS does what you need than i would recommend this one over all other Chromebooks and most other laptops."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "Now I know why these are called \"Chomebooks.\" You can't do anything that can't be done within a Chrome web browser. This is definitely not a replacement for a laptop, and I was hoping that it would be. It does boot fast, is incredibly light and attractive and has an amazing battery life - depending on what you're doing, you can get eight hours or more. But you are limited on what types of files you can open, and you can't put any programs on it. You must use the Google equivalents instead; for example, Google Hangouts instead of Skype, Google Docs instead of Word. You can download web apps, but tablet or Android apps from Google Play will not work.\n\nAll that being said, every Chromebook will have those limitations, not just this one. There are some huge benefits to the idea of a Chromebook, too. I'm coming to this laptop after having a MacBook for five years and refusing to get a PC, and it feels very similar to me. The operating system runs very smoothly and is not clunky in any way, and I love it. It's very easy to set up and figure out how to use. Everything you do is backed up to the Google Cloud, so you can access everything anywhere.\n\nIf you fully understand what a Chromebook is and that it is NOT an adequate replacement for a laptop if you regularly use anything other than a web browser and word processing, I would highly recommend this one. It's fast, it's light, the screen resolution is great, and it has a much larger screen than many other Chromebooks. The color is really quite pretty, and the soft finish feels great. It also seems to pick up WiFi connections from further away than my old laptop, and I have not had any major issues with pages not loading or videos or video chats lagging. The speakers are on the bottom of the computer, which seems a little strange, but it makes things sound louder when the computer is on a hard surface. I've never felt that it doesn't play loud enough. There is a fan, unlike some other Chromebooks, so it doesn't run silently, but I definitely wouldn't call it loud.\n\nFinally, what sold me on this is that it came with two free years of T-Mobile 4g. I'm not sure if Amazon also offers this deal (I bought it in a store), but it's a great deal for the price.\n\nTLDR? If you need a full-blown laptop with the ability to install programs, this isn't for you. If all you need is a place for Facebook, reading news, taking notes in Google Docs and watching Hulu and Netflix, this is exactly what you're looking for, and it's a great buy."}

This Chromebook (and others, too) are basically a Chrome browser.  But it is the speediest Chrome browser ever with all the available extensions.  Some Android apps seem to work, too.  Plus, the keyboard has just the right tension to feel solid, but not cheap.  It's a quiet typist, too.  The medium res screen is fine, coming from using plenty of similar Dell screens, this one is fine.  Anything bigger than 13 is also welcome as it is better than any tiny scrawny mini laptop.  This feels like it can do plenty of surfing, research, small papers, and be able to consume plenty of media.  Simple browser games work well.  It is not touchscreen, but touchscreen on a laptop is a little bit of a gimmick anyways.  For the first day I tried it, I used it in the morning, closed the lid, and used it from 5pm to midnight doing all kinds of things with video and video heavy websites and it is still cranking.  This is so much better than 5 or 6 hour laptops and nearing Ipad battery life, which you know is incredible.  The instant on makes it feel snappy and the SSD drive make the Chromebook feel unbreakable/shockproof.  The style is also nice.  Some of the lesser brands look like cheap netbooks.  This almost (very almost) compares to the first Macbook Airs when they first came out, but this is even better because it is faster, smoother, plays HD video, has HDMI out and USB.  The original Macbook Air can't do any of those things and is sitting in my closet.  The HP Chromebook 14 is still humming along, able to do 99% of all my couch surfing without a hiccup.  For the price, you will not be disappointed, but with the performance, you will also be impressed.  It's like Google read our minds about what kind of computer people really need.

The only downside is that with a standard PC you don't have issues with downloading certain software, etc.  Since this is completely Google related, no Microsoft software is able to be downloaded.  No Word, Office, Excel.  Only Google apps.  It's not bad, you just have to get the proper apps in the \"store\" so that you are able to use Word - since its been the software that is most used.  Make sure you have a printer that is able to print via the Cloud.  They call it a \"Cloud Ready\" printer.  Most new models will say it's cloud ready on the box.\n\nPersonally, the laptop is perfect for me.  It's an online based laptop - app related - and that is what I use it for.  You set up a google account when using this but you get free storage in their cloud for everything you need to save for a certain amount of time.  Lightweight and thin!

You can get Spotify, Word, even a torrent client on this thing. What else do I need? Many apps are online-based today anyway. My needs mostly consist of notetaking (Google Docs is excellent), writing papers, making presentations. It has worked almost flawlessly for everything I have needed, the battery life is adequate for a long day of classes, it rarely lags with multiple tabs open (note: 4gb RAM version), and it is much lighter than a Macbook or my old HP laptop. I have noticed no decline in performance over two years, except the battery seems to have somewhat less capacity than it used to.\nMy only real gripe is that sometimes there are compatibility issues when downloading Microsoft PPT slides such as those that my professors provide, where converting these files to make them Google-compatible may leave out an image or cause small formatting issues. These issues are mostly minor and manageable. Small gripes: the white exterior of this laptop looks a little dirty over time. A backlit keyboard would be nice but the lack of one is certainly not a dealbreaker.\nI am extremely satisfied with this Chromebook, especially for under $300 paid. It has had tremendous value to me, and I would not hesitate to recommend one of these devices (the newer models have even better processors, and backlit keyboards)."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "I have had this HP Chromebook for over one year. My old laptop broke and I was in the market for something quick for college work. I did not do very much research and I had a budget at the time. This was on sale at the local Walmart for $350. I thought I had made a great choice. I love the design. It is a sturdy laptop. If you are looking for a Chromebook, that has great build quality. This is it. The soft paint is gorgeous and the keys are clicky. I enjoy typing on it. Chrome is awesome. The battery life is solid and it's quiet. For a person that has no need for major storage, Microsoft applications, and the technical newness of using Chrome OS, you will be satisfied. I am now in the market for a different laptop and have struggled using this Chromebook as my daily student driver laptop. I wish I would have done more research before I purchased this and that is totally on me. I have been using other laptops around the house for the purpose of saving online word documents to upload them correctly for class assignments. The proctor service I use for tests does not allow Chrome OS so I also have to plan on using another computer when taking tests. It's just a pain in the butt. I will be switching to a MacBook or ultrabook in the next month or so because I really need a laptop that can handle all of my basic student needs. Here's a short list of pros and cons I have devised after using this Chromebook for over a year.\n\nPros:\n14 inches is a sweet spot on screen size (imo)\nBoots so fast\nChome OS (depending on needs)\nclicky responsive keyboard\ndecent screen resolution, good for movies.\naverage weight. not super light, not really heavy.\nthe battery life is pretty awesome over six hours of solid use before needing to plug in\ntrackpad works fine, very responsive\ngood amount of ports, HDMI and three USB\nwebcam\nGreat hinge for opening laptop, one solid long hinge. I really like laptops that provide this type of hinging mechanism. It's way more reliable than the standard two hinge closures on most midrange laptops.\nvisually pleasing. It looks and feels high quality. It's nothing I would be ashamed to bring into a classroom.\n\nCons:\nChrome OS: if you are a student that relies on hard Microsoft applications (not just online) do not buy this laptop.\nIf you are an online student that relies on proctoring to take tests. check with your proctor before buying a Chromebook to see if they approve Chrome OS for test taking. If you are someone who needs a lot of storage capacities, this may not be for you. I would try a laptop with 128 GB or 256 GB SSD if you are looking for strictly SSD. This laptop provides 16 GB if I remember correctly.\nThe screen is super glare prone. There is definitely no matte finish on it. weird viewing angles and very reflective!!\nSkyping sucks, cannot download the full version, have to install things to work around it and I never could get it to really work right.\nThe sound quality is not good. My phone is louder and has better sound quality.\nThe soft touch paint can show dirt easily (at least on my snow white version)\nThere is no CAP LOCK button.\nrunning multiple tabs can slow this down significantly. When doing school work I could have more than seven or eight tabs going and it would slow the Chromebook down but I think that is a given for the ram in this thing. My cell phone has more ram than this Chromebook.\n\nOverall, I love this Chromebook!! But the rest of the working and student world is not ready for Chrome OS to take over and have everything online based. I wish I could stick with this but I just can't."}

And I did research and found all the chromebook cameras are the same!\nThen I find out it doesnt allow Skype or Microsoft word (2 essential things I need in life). To get them on the laptop you have to jump through so many holes, it took me several days to figure out.\nAfter about 2 months the screen cracked. I'm talking GIANT upside down v shape on my screen. I take great care of it: never slam it shut, always have it in the laptop case and then another bag if I have to take it out, and I kept it on a desk away from children and dogs. This thing literally broke for no reason! And after it broke it started loading slower.\nNext the wifi reader doesnt read my wifi half the time and I have to sit here waiting 5-10minutes for it to finally find it.\nNow to mention that also it has no caps button. SO IF I WANT TO WRITE A SENTENCE LIKE THIS, I have to hold down the shift button.\n\nThis computer had so many cons and was one of the worst electronics I have ever owned. Do not purchase this laptop."}

We set it up for him and have used it when visiting--I think we will be ordering one for ourselves soon.  It is very lightweight and, after a year, the white has not gotten discolored from use.  Being a chromebook, there are some features that are different from your standard laptop (i.e right-clicking, dragging, and scrolling down a page), but a quick Google search and you'll know exactly what to do!  The only thing we had some issues with is installing a printer.  Only certain printers are capable of connecting to a Chromebook and the one we had could not connect.

It loads from off to the internet within 5-6 seconds every time. I don't worry about viruses since it's not running on a windows operating system. I was worried about not having Microsoft Word, but have learned to use Google Documents and it works out perfectly for me. It's the perfect size for carrying everywhere and so light wait that I forget it's even in my bag. It's nothing like any computer I have ever used before. It's a dream to have. The color is bright and has not gotten faded or scratched up like I feared it might. I do keep it in a case when not in use, but carry it everywhere with me and it is very much used. I would recommend it to anyone who uses the internet frequently and doesn't need a disk drive or a ton of programs downloaded. I worried about downloading pictures and files to it, but have had no problems. I am able to download all of my pictures and files just like any other computer and re-upload them as needed. It's quick and effective and my go-to carrying computer any time I leave the house. Also, the battery life is unheard of. I get 10-12 hours out of a full charge, and it doesn't seem to use any battery life when it's in sleep mode. Definitely worth all 5 stars!"}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "Do not purchase ANY products from this company, especially Chromebooks.  They are poorly made and poorly serviced.  HPs customer service knows nothing of either the customer or service.\n\nI have been awaiting shipment of my replacement Chromebook for over a month (details below).  Due to the complexity of my issue I was assigned a Customer Relations Case Manager (Vivian Hernandez, PPS CSS-A Customer Relations Case Manager).  Her co-worker, Paola Vanessa Picon was also included in all correspondence.\n\nThe last I heard from either of these two ladies was on Aug 11th.  I was told that my Chromebook would ship on Aug 28th.  That day has come and gone.  Despite several follow up emails and voice messages I have not heard back.  Attempts to call several HP service numbers proved fruitless as the reps either could not access my case information or had non-functioning voice mail systems.\n\nSo heres my story...\n\nIn November of 2014 I purchased an HP Chromebook 14. It had 4G of RAM and a 32G SDD. I was happy with it. While not as sleek as an Apple product, it met my needs.\n\nAround Feb or March of this year (2015) I noticed that some of the keys weren't working, specifically the I, J, U, T, and a few others. I installed all updates, and even power washed the unit, but no luck. I called HP, they agreed that the unit was defective and dispatched a box for return and repair.\n\nAfter about 2 weeks I received the unit back, but the keys STILL didn't work. Checking the paperwork it became clear that HP replaced the MOTHER board, not the KEY board.\n\nI called, complained and another box was dispatched. This repair took over three weeks due to some part shortage. I found this unacceptable, complained and my repair was expedited.\n\nI received my repaired unit in April, but noticed that Chrome would crash (He's Dead Jim) frequently. I put up with it for a while, but recently started to dig around. What I discovered is that I no longer have 4Gig of RAM, but 2 Gig and that my processes consume most of that.  When the motherboard was replaced it had the incorrect RAM size.\n\nAfter contacting HP yet again, and speaking to the above case manager, it was agreed that a new Chromebook was in order.  This was on July 28th.  Any and all attempts to determine when (or if) my new Chromebook will ship have been met with radio silence.  Emails are not answered and phone messages are not returned.  Collectively Ive spent hours either on hold or  speaking to a rep.\n\nIve come to the conclusion that the replacement of my Chromebook was a lie, that HP felt that if they delayed the process long enough, Id simply give up and go away.\n\nPurchase a product from this company if you feel you have no alternative, but do so knowing that in the event service is required (even under warranty) you're basically on your own.\n\nYou've been warned."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "I received this computer a few months after I started to realize my Acer C710 wasn't going to be able to hold up to the usage I put on it. So far, I've had one of these for several months, and it is one of the best computers I've ever used. The first unit I received was damaged during it's refurbishment and that damage was not detected by the seller. The SSD locked up one morning and the computer refused to boot. All attempts to recover it failed. However, HP support and Amazon were both very helpful, HP offering to expedite my shipping to get the damaged unit fixed, but it would take a few days longer then I had (it was the beginning of school vacation, thankfully, but the computer wouldn't arrive until the middle of the next week, right after I needed it) so Amazon took the damaged unit back and shipped us a new one for FREE.\n\nThis current computer, and the old one, both work(ed) very, very well. The only complaints I have about the current unit is that the paint on the cover started to chip only a few weeks after I got it, the fan is noisy (it still works, but there's something making it buzz), and every so often the keyboard will be odd. I think the keyboard thing is just me though, because there's also a search key right where the shift/caps keys were on my last computer.\n\nThis computer is a powerhouse of a Chromebook, with it's 4GB of RAM. Unfortunately, it isn't upgradable, so definitely opt for the higher RAM. That being said, unless you're very tech savvy, the SSD isn't upgradeable either, so make sure you get a 32GB one. Chrome OS as a whole is a dream to work with. Responsive and fast, this computer IS a little big, but on lighter school days, I have no problem carrying it around with me. My school's WIFI is horrible, so having the free 4G (Thanks, T-Mobile!!!) is amazingly helpful. There is no VGA port on this, only HDMI, so keep that in mind if you're planning on doing any kind of presentation. Battery life... wow! I can milk this computer for DAYS without a charge, although it's average usage time for what I'm doing is about 12 hours. There is also no way to remove the battery, so keep that in mind. Sound is what I'd expect, touchpad is BEAUTIFUL, and the screen is very nice. Webcam doesn't live up to what HP says, and neither does the MIC, but that's okay, because I rarely need those features. Connecting via Chrome Remote Desktop to a server/home computer is very easy. Computer (for me at least) runs slightly warm, but not hot to the touch (if it is, I'd suggest calling HP).\n\nOverall, the unit gets a 8/10. TL;dr? Amazing computer with some shortfalls, good for school (if you use Google like I do), super battery life."}

My first chromebook went through reparement twice and broke for the third time in two months, and its replacement broke again within two months:\n\nI purchased a manufacturer refurbished chromebook on 01/27/2015 from Woots. Within a month, the keyboard stopped working (7, Y, \"U\", \"H\", \"J\", \"N\", \"M\" keys didn't work). I wanted to return it but Woots pushed me to the HP customer service (CS). It took me multiple phone calls to even get the repairing process started, because my chromebook came with a smudged label, thus I didn't have a serial number.\n\nFinally the CS repaired the keyboard and shipped it back to me. The keyboard was fixed but a new problem showed up: the lower-left screen was black.\n\nI mailed it back to the CS for the second repair. The screen was fixed, but the touch pad didn't work. At the time, I thought I got a defected unit. CS offered me to replace it with a brand new unit and I accepted it.\n\nIn the end of March 2015, I received a new chromebook. Today, 05/23/2015, I, K, , keys stopped working.\n\nI am very frustrated with the chromebook, and now want my money back.\n\nConclusion: Save your money and save your time. Dont waste it on this chromebook."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "TLDR:\n\n- Bought reconditioned from Woot for $230\n- Great battery life (about 8~9 hours at 75% brightness)\n- Good sound quality\n- Comes with a lot of ports\n- Ubuntu Linux works (dual booted with ChromeOS and Linux) great and can be used as a full laptop\n- Fairly quick for most of the tasks\n- Does not look cheap at all\n- Free 4G Tmobile data plan (200MB/month). But not available on all models so pls check before buying.\n\nLong version:\n\nI bought factory reconditioned with 4GB Ram and 32 GB SSD from Woot for $250 (including taxes and shipping. Actual price was $230 without taxes and shipping). It came with 4G Tmobile (free 200MB/month) data plan for the lifetime of the chromebook. I also installed Ubuntu using crouton method as described on the Internet. This thing is so AWESOME! I use ChromeOS for most of the browsing and it runs very fast. I can open up to 10 tabs and listen to music with no lag. The sound quality is also very good. And the battery life is very very good. Let me repeat, THE BATTERY LIFE IS REALLY REALLY GOOD. I used it for continuous 5 hours of browsing (at around 75% brightness) and it still showed that there was another 4.45 hours worth of battery is left in this thing. When I need to do something more than browsing (editing Word, Excel sheets etc), I can either use Google Apps or start Ubuntu and use that. Ubuntu runs very fast in it. I don't see the need to upgrade the SSD in this device but I have read that you can do that in this Device. Physically thing does not really look cheap. When I first saw it at BestBuy, I was not very happy since it looked cheap and dirty. But that is because the display model was abused by people. This can be used as a replacement for your laptop. But keep in mind its only good for normal (highly debatable word) browsing. Good for school. Very good for traveling. This is now my go to laptop and have replaced my actual Windows laptop. I still use my old Windows 7 but only when I need to use any proprietary software. Highly recommended."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "I will start this review by stating that I didn't purchase this exact model of the HP Chromebook, but I couldn't find the exact one that I purchased on Amazon. Really the only difference is that the one I have has 4gb of RAM and my model was refurbished.\n\nI considered quite a few different options as far as Chromebooks go. I settled on this particular one because I got a great deal on price, the reviews were good, and it's one of the larger Chromebooks you can buy. The 11 inch ones were way too small for my liking, and although I think I would have been okay with a 13, this one is even better. I am very pleased with my purchase of the HP Chromebook 14 for quite a number of reasons.\n\nFor starters, I knew exactly what I was purchasing when I purchased it. This is an electronic device whose main function is to provide internet access. This computer is perfect for portability, speed, and doing any and everything web based. If you need more than that in a computer, look elsewhere. This Chromebook has become the replacement for my old Dell Inspiron. Based on what I used a computer for, and based on the features in a \"normal\" computer that I never got use out of, this Chromebook was the perfect solution for me.\n\nI got rid of my Dell Inspiron because I was looking at replacing the battery for a SECOND time, my files and hard drive were a total mess with all of the files/programs downloaded over the years, it had a lot of unnecessary programs I NEVER used, it was ridiculously slow to boot, constantly unusable due to installing \"updates\" that took far too long, the screen had developed a thin blue line down the lefthand side... and the list goes on. Basically I really needed a new computer. That's when I realized that all of the junk a \"regular\" computer has, is really of no use to me, and most of it actually inhibits what I truly use my computer to do!\n\nI use my computer for watching television shows, listening to Spotify, using Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Tumblr, and doing online shopping. Every now and then I use it for light document use or photo editing. Over time I've realized that I don't use any programs that need to be downloaded, I don't need the full blown version of Microsoft Office, and I don't have a whole lot of documents/photos that require a large hard drive on a computer. Even if I needed more space than this thing has to offer, I'd just use Google Drive or Dropbox. If your computer usage is anything like mine, you will definitely enjoy the HP Chromebook 14.\n\nUPDATE SEPTEMBER 2015:\nStill absolutely love my Chromebook. The money I spent on it was well worth it as it is something that I use every single day and hasn't given me a single issue. I don't really see myself ever spending more unnecessary money on a \"real\" computer again!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "There is a learning curve to using the Chrome OS, but once you've got it, you will find it irresistible ... and the price more than recommends it (under $300.00)  For instance, to right click an item you use a two-finger click on the touch pad.  And the whole bottom half of the touch-pad is click-able.\n\nWith Google Drive, I can share all my important information between the Chrome-book, my work laptop, and my work PC.  The Apps available are useful (like the Remote Desktop Tool).  The only thing that is missing is the ability to use Microsoft Silverlight to view Time Warner Cable TV on my laptop.  And there doesn't seem to be a viable alternative.  But I'm not suffering.\n\nKeep in mind that I'm a light home user, using it mainly for entertainment purposes.  But if this is the wave of the future (Cloud computing), then other manufacturers will have to follow suit.  If I turn it off, it takes no time at all to turn back on.  But I keep it on and just close the lid at night.  When I open it again, it's instantly on.  This is convenient when I have my hands full, so I can carry it under my arm because it's no heavier than a book would be.\n\nBattery life is great, I can surf and watch on the cloud nearly all day without a charge.  The only thing I needed was a second adapter to keep downstairs, while the main adapter is upstairs for charging at night."}

I know when the Internet goes down they are almost useless, then again us oldies have a backup plan, taking naps. The one downside we encountered was it doesn't come with a program to unzip compressed files. I found an application, but it was slower than molasses. I ended up going to my desktop, downloading the zip files from Disney World, unzipping them to a flash drive, then plugging the flash drive in the Chromebook, and uploading the pictures.

I think HP hit a homerun on this design, and despite the price, it doesn't feel cheap, and made the best use out of the available material for that cost.\nScreen color balance is a so so, but overall, its color brilliant and I enjoy watching videos from it.\nKey travel is short, like most Chromebooks and ultrabooks, but I can comfortably and quickly touch type on it.  I think its feels better than my much more expensive HP Envy 15.\nTrackpad is one of the most impressive I have ever experienced in a notebook.  Why even bother with a mouse.\nBattery life is not bad, I can go a whole day with it, but not as good as the Acer C720 or Dell Chromebook 11, and that's probably the batteries have to light up a bigger screen.\nPerformance as always, when you pair ChromeOS with an Intel Haswell processor, snappy.  Updates over time made ChromeOS even faster.\nAnd did I say this Chromebook is built very well? But it does have one drawback, its also bigger and heavier than your average Chromebook.  It might be lighter than many conventional Windows notebooks but many of its Chromebook brethren are lighter than this."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "I love this Chromebook.  After trying several, in stores and in-person, I must say this model is the best for me.\n\nFirst of all, I find the screen to be superior to the others.  It is glossy, which I prefer, and the brightness and colors are spot-on.  I found the screens on Asus, Toshiba and even latest HP Chromebooks to be dull and somewhat \"washed out\" by comparison.  I did not want the \"Full HD\" screens some manufacturers are releasing due to the higher resolution (smaller fonts).\n\nThe overall build of the HP models is much sturdier and more solid-feeling than the others in my opinion.  The Toshiba and Asus felt like toys while this HP feels well-made like my wife's Mac.\n\nThe keyboard is great, also better than the others.  It has an excellent, large trackpad\n\nThe speakers are amazing, pumping out much better and deeper sound than expected.  Although I thought the processor and RAM specs were the same as the other Intel models I tried, this model seems faster than those and even better than the nVidia-powered unit I tried.\n\nI love the look, with the overall white finish and silver trim- reminds me of the older iMacs and iBooks.\n\nThe closest thing I can say to a negative is that this is the only Chromebook I have tried with a fan- and after seeing (hearing?) how mice a fanless laptop is, it's a bummer to once again have a fan.  But the fan is relatively quiet.\n\nSince HP has apparently decided to get rid of the nice, glossy screens in all their Chromebooks, I'm tempted to get another \"last year's model\" HP14 as a spare! The screen is that much better.\n\nBe well.\n\nNOTE: I thought I should post the following, regarding my impression that this Chromebook seemed a little faster than the others I tried.  After writing this review, I ran the Peacekeeper benchmark on the machine.  It scored nearly twice as high as the other Chromeooks I had benchmarked! In other words, it was apparently not just my impression but this model does run a little smoother. FYI."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "After a year of use I am quite pleased. Unexpectedly, it has completely replaced my laptop for all travel scenarios. The ease of use is amazing. Updates are automatic and only take a minute. It really does boot up in seconds. The battery lasts quite a while too. Once one migrates their work to Google Docs/Drive it is incredibly efficient and easy to access all of one's work, not just from the chromebook but from any platform.\n\nWould buy again."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "Best option for non gamers and w8 haters.  I got this after my asus with w8 froze up aftermp 1yr and my 8yr old mac died. I didn't want to shell out $1k+ for a mac neither did I want to get anywhere near windows again.  So far so good,  only addon I did get is 1Tb usb drive which solves storage and cloud security problems.  Im a huge adnroid lover so learning this was a breeze since most things are in Google docs now. Have not had to load printer yet, I just use old laser printer and laptop with vista. Im not a gamer so can't address those complaints,  but video streaming is breeze, just added javscript popup blocker and poper blocker,  never had a crash or take over unlike with w8. Definitely worth the under $200 alternative to horrid windows platform as well as the arm n leg costs to mac os. Just get a usb drive storage and you'll be set"}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "Was really happy with this purchase until it died 5 days after the warranty expired. Got an error message saying that Chrome OS was missing or damaged. I went through the recovery process multiple times with no success. Called Google support who diagnosed as a hardware problem. HP said that I can pay $180 to repair it because my warranty expired 5 days ago.\n\nRepairing it would be a waste of my money.  5 days out if warranty & HP won't stand by their product?  That's an indictment on the quality of these things if you all me.  I was planning on buying one for my wife & son too."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "The hardware is very sleek, lightweight, portable. It boots in about 8 seconds. I don't care for the all-in-one trackpad-mouse. When I'm moving the pointer a longer distance I'll pick my finger up and put it down again, but it is often treated as a right-mouse click. I'm not sure how to turn that behavior off, but a small wireless mouse made my experience much better. Also, there are no Page Up / Page Down buttons. Something like Alt-Arrow Up or Down simulates these missing keys. I haven't yet tried the built-in camera.\nThe Chrome OS is impressive, but it's not Windows. No MS Office here, it's designed to be used with Google Docs. It is nice and snappy for use with Facebook, YouTube, Flickr, Gmail, Web browsing. It is not a useful gamer machine and it's not for software development. It's not designed for local storage, so you will want to be connected to Wifi for most usage. The software programs available to load are basically Chrome extensions. There's a lot out there, but don't assume everything you want to do is available and free. For example, there's only one useful RDP extension which isn't free and only allows one instance to run at a time.\nIn summary, this is a niche computer. The hardware is more like a laptop than a tablet (esp. the keyboard), but tablets (Apple and Android) have much more software available."}

As a chrome book it's main program is google so you need to have gmail in order to set a passlock, the main programs aren't Microsoft word, excel, and PowerPoint (which is what I was used to) instead it has google made programs such as google docs. After using it for many apon many essays for school I realized that google docs is very smart. You can access any of the documents on any computer when you sign into your gmail account which is a blessing when you need to print your essay and forgot your flash drive & computer.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "I purchased this Chromebook in July of 2014.  It is now January 15, 2015.  This computer is the biggest piece of crap I've ever purchased.  In the short seven months of owning it, I have taken excellent care of it.  It's never been dropped and has never had food or drink spilled on it.\n\nThat being said, the first thing that started going wrong was the keyboard.  I've never experienced \"sticky keys\" in a mere three months of owning a lap top, but this Chromebook not only had random keys stick, but many keys began staying down when pressed down, causing my work documents an innumerable amount of errors.  The space bar stayed completely pressed down for minutes on end and since, despite numerous \"cleanings\", it just keeps getting worse.\n\nThe font size on my display changes randomly as I'm typing.  I've used the help key and other various ideas from other owners on the internet.  Most recently, there's a lovely yellow line running down the front of my display that just appeared out of nowhere.  I am completely disgusted and frustrated over this whole joke of a computer.  Upon concluding this review, I'm contacting the seller and the better business bureau.  People need to be given this information before they waste a dime on this \"lemon\" of a computer.\n\nI gave it ONE star to rate it, but would have given none if possible."}

Ex: if you wanted to download and play minecraft on your computer, you wouldn't be able to. you may want to get a wireless mouse. - there is nothing wrong with mouse pad, but it can get a bit annoying because when you move your finger over the clicker part of the pad, it may mistake it as a click.\n\nInfo on Downloads- if you really want to use a Chromebook for your games and downloads, then you can download Linux- this will change the software on the computer, but you will be able to download anything like a normal computer (i don't have Linux)\n\nSUMMARY OF DEVICE- When you first open it, there will be a page that asks you for an email addess and it's password. Once you do that it should find it and you will find the screen as a desktop. (You can have multiple different users on one Chromebook using different emails)\n  -On the desktop there will be all Google based apps- mainly features on Google and the apps are just links to that page on the web.\n  -That's about it!

Now, I am having an issue with an error, and the suggested recovery not working. Again, I have now not used it for weeks and I might need to ship it back. Also, you cannot simply remove the batter, you have to unscrew and un-attach the whole back (which I have not yet attempted b/c I'm nervous to mess something up).\n\nAlso, my brother, who works with computers, now tells me I should have never gotten a chromebook and I would have asked him originally he would have discouraged me from buying one.

We used it for a couple of hours, then stored it in the original box.  We pulled it from the box this week (Dec 2014)  and it will not operate at all without being plugged into AC.  We've gone through the whole formal troubleshooting protocol with Google and HP.  The only option HP offered was to spend $249.99 + shipping and handling to have HP repair it.\n\nNo user replaceable battery.  Obviously something to avoid.  The warranty for the refurb is just 90 days.  Consider another brand or maybe spending the extra to buy it new since the additional money will essentially buy you a one year warranty.  The refurb is just too much of a risk.  So when the battery dies, which they all do eventually, this computer turns into a boat anchor anyways.  Wow.\n\nI have to add, the part about it that totally completed the perfect buying experience was the HP rep (sounded like an outsourced operation in India perhaps) chastising me for buying a refurbished chromebook, I should have considered my purchase more carefully.

I am constantly moving the screen for myself. The display is blurry by 2013 standards. It's does not work for projects when working with other people because of the poor viewing angle. Dark images have the worst LCD glare/buzz of any screen that I have seen in years. I really expected better hardware from HP and I expected good hardware for this premium price. Only the bottom edge of the track pad is clickable. I like the Chrome OS, but that has nothing to do with the hardware. No ethernet port. I give it 2 stars instead of 1 because it does have one HDMI and three USB ports."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "Everything seems great about this Chromebook. It looks wonderful, is lightweight, screen produces sharp, vivid picture with natural colors. Touch pad is also perfect. Tested all ports - USB, HDMI, headphone, SD Card reader - all are working without a glitch. Camera is also pretty good, I'd say it's perfect for video chatting on Google Hangouts (Skype is not available on Chromebooks).\n\nThings you can do with any Chromebook are: browsing Internet, watching videos and photos online or from an internal 16 GB SSD Drive, or your removable media, such as USB drives and SD Cards. Most, but not all popular photo formats and video codecs are supported. You can install many Chrome browser extensions and applications, including some games from Google store, where many of them are available for free, others require some payment. Online basic Office suite - Google Docs is available for a free use. Google play is also accessible. NOTE: you can not install any Windows or Apple applications on this device, but if your are not a user of heavyweight programs, such as Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Office, etc., you will be happy with this very fast, smooth running, maintenance-free, Chromebook PC.\n\nImportant Note: If you buy a used, open box or refurbished Chromebook, chances are pretty high that you won't be able to sign up for free 100GB cloud space on Google Drive, offered by Google to all owners of new Chromebooks. The reason: only one free account available per each machine, and if the box has been opened, someone likely already used this free benefit, offered only once for each particular Chromebook device. I don't think this is fair. It should be at the very least stated clearly that this important feature ir probably unavailable on any open box, used, or refurbished Chromebooks."}

However, I didn't want a PC because I didn't trust myself to do work when I had the option to log onto Steam and play video games. Don't get me wrong, Chromebooks have casual app games, but I normally don't like those. It's lightning fast and the mouse pad gestures are great. It all works out of your Chrome browser for the most part, but I already had most of my stuff linked to Google and Google Drive with me being a loyal android phone user. It's a great stripped down experience that works perfectly for my school work, note taking (the online versions of Microsoft Office are free, so you can use the Note program), and general browsing/media.\n\nI would especially recommend this to anyone who also has their life tied to Google atm."}

All phones and tables in my home have great signal in the same spot, and this guy just keep losing the connection and requiring a manual disconnect/reconnect of the wireless. It happens every 10 minutes so seeing a movie in this comp is very bothersome.\n-Poor resolution. I prefer using my cellphone to see a movie than this chromebook.\n-Deletion of hard drive. It is fine to keep the data on cloud. But sometimes you need files locally, at least meanwhile you are copying from other source to upload later.  And this device just keeps deleting the files I just copied. I read later that the files in the drive are just a temporal cache, that can be deleted at any time. That should be informed as soon as you start copying files there.\n-Mouse: Drag and drop is very hard with this mouse.\n\nIt ended up piled with a bunch of magazines. We are using the cellphones and the firetv for entertaining and went back to the laptop for working."}

If you are someone who uses Google Drive a lot you get a free year of storage...but have to pay for it after that.\n\nOverall this is an excellent machine, and I'm loving using it.

It literally took my wife a minute to turn it on and log-in for the first time.  It has everything you would expect from a Chromebook.\n\nUltimately, the interface is smooth and loading pages happens instantly.  The 14\" screen is sufficient but I prefer to go \"full screen\" because the tile bar at the bottom and search bar on the webpage take up real estate.  I couldn't imagine getting a smaller laptop and surfing the web without some discomfort.\n\nThe laptop is a little on the heavy side compared to the HP Stream 14.  However, it does have a solid feel and hinge.  I've yet to run any Play Store games but I would suggest they run fine with on-board Intel HD graphics.\n\nIf you are in the market for a Chromebook I couldn't recommend anything else.

A bigger display = less battery life.\nI admit to owning a Macbook Pro which weighs the same as this Chromebook, comparing this to a Macbook isn't really fair so other than weighing the same I'll leave it at that.\nFor 90% of what people do on a computer, a Chromebook is ideal."}

I recently bought a 3rd one (to replace the first one with the broken monitor). I'm now expecting it to die by April 2015.\n\nIt's a nice, light laptop that's pleasant to the eye and initially fun to use. The startup is extremely quick, the initial setup is fast and painless. The quality of Hangouts video calls beats Skype. Chrome OS works just great for basic internet needs, browsing, social media and video.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "Bought this computer for my mother.  She is elderly.  Was a bit skeptical on the operating system, as she has never used Chrome before. She LOVES it.  Said it was literally, \"start up and go.\"  Lightweight, not concerned that it didn't have a DVD drive (she never uses one anyway); loves the fact that it's so versitile, and with the WIFI capability she can take it literally anywhere and has all of her info stored online and can take with her anywhere.  Also an added bonus was the limited ability of viruses.  I would totally recommend this product to anyone needing a basic laptop for browsing, emails, watching youtube, streaming music, etc.  Definitely not a \"gaming\" laptop.  But, definitely is serving it's purpose with her and at a very reasonable price."}

It's my go to device now instead of my $1500 sony convertible laptop, which is an awesome device with a terrible OS.\n\nPros:\nKeyboard is awesome.\nTouchpad is great in every way I can imagine.\nBattery lasts forever.\nFan is quiet but keeps it cool. This makes it way better than the Toshiba Chromebook which has no fan. I can have this on my lap for a long time with no discomfort.\nFree T-Mobile internet? Are you kidding me? Best thing ever!\nNever crashes, never freaks out with errors, doesn't require any stupid setups or anything. It's just impossible to go back to windows now...\n\nCons:\nHIDEOUS colors and viewing angles after getting used to tablet/tv with IPS display. Everything is depressingly washed out.\nCharging port lets the cable fall out of the hole for no reason. I have to push it in every so often."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "I got the free-4G-for-life version at Costco for $50 more. I was looking for something bigger than my old ipad to tide me over for writing (the ipad's keyboard is just too clumsy for real writing) until I can afford a new macbook (or until the retina airbooks come out & all the prices drop). Costco only showed the front view, so I didn't realize it was completely aqua on the outside (wrongly assumed it was just an accent color framing the screen) until it arrived. It was pretty hideous, but I figured I could get a skin to make it tolerable for such a low price.\n\nI knew chromebooks were very limited, but I didn't realize just how limited until I got mine. There are only a handful of apps, so all of the little basics you take for granted require workarounds. The worst missing piece for me was skype. Yes, I know you can use google hangouts, but try getting your retired parents to figure it out.\n\nBut for the low low price and the 4G coverage, I thought I'd muddle through. But the 4G was terrible, even in cities and along interstates (and forget about out in the country, where I live).\n\nAnd worst of all, the very thing that is appealing (immediately updated cloud storage of all your documents) is incredibly, maddeningly unreachable whenever the network connection is sketchy. And for me, this happened frequently, even when I was right by a wifi signal and all other sites were easily accessible on the same machine. The is nothing more frustrating than having a good flow going with a project and suddenly find your typing is having no effect because you can't connect to google docs or whatever. It doesn't automatically capture your work and update when you reconnect in a few minutes; it simply freezes your input. Yes you can save offline, but that involves other steps and a complete work interruption.\n\nNow, I do have to say that if all you need is a web browser and to check your gmail, it works beautifully. It was lightning fast, had a great battery life & charged quickly. If you want a machine just for surfing on the couch or sitting on your back porch, and you don't use skype or need reliable cell coverage, this is a great machine: cheap, fast, and energy efficient. It would be a great machine for a kid or a grandparent, or a fine second machine for someone with a great desktop who just wants a browser they can use on the couch.\n\nFor me, it just didn't have enough to offer to make it worth lugging around, so I took it back  (Costco has a liberal return policy, even on computers)."}

There are many apps that I cannot use such as skype. It is NOT that fast on the internet. If I had multiple tabs open, it would lag. I couldn't use Spotify very easily. It would often give me error messages while playing music. The keyboard and touch pad are flimsy. There is no delete button on the keyboard. Of course, with it being a Chromebook, I cannot create Word documents. The screen resolution is horrible, and you have to adjust it while you are using it because if it is not at jist the right angle, it looks poorly lit.\n People need to understand that it is not a laptop. Doesnt even come close. All I can do really is get on the internet with it. I COULDNT NAVIGATE ON CRAIGSLIST. It would tell me that it was a bad gateway. This is a waste of $300.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "It's a very nice looking laptop. It serves its functions so as far as what it's supposed to do, it's perfect. I bought this laptop because of my budget and I had to settle for something cheap.\n\nPros:\n-Looks great, sleek and no cheap material. Very durable material.\n-Great camera. Good quality and captures light very well.\n-Functions well and fast, the solid state drive makes it turn on in a matter of a second(literally one second) and shuts off in a second as well, navigation through sites is also fast.\n-Gives you 100GB of free storage in Google Drive\n-Great speakers, sound is very loud and clear\n-No microsoft programs, but google drive's functions are immense and very underestimated. You have google docs, powerpoint and excel like programs on drive. You can pretty much upload anything in google drive as well.\n-No viruses, and no ads, with that being said, I recommend downloading adblock and adblock plus on google chrome extensions.\n\nCons:\n-Functions are very limited. You will not be able to use this laptop like you use a windows laptop at all. At most you can only download pdf files. Some videos but you can have a lot of pictures. Only 16GB of memory but its main focus is for cloud storage.\n-You can't have apps like as if you had a phone. All apps are browser based or are chrome extensions. Apps are only powered by chrome web store. There is no google play. Which means most the apps will require you to be connected to wifi.\n-Like I said before, it's not like windows laptop and therefore you can't really do much at all except for using the web browser. You can't torrent things or have programs.\n\nIn betweens(not pros but not cons and some light mishaps):\n-At first when I got it the software wasn't updated (needs to be updated if you want to use the camera) and it was tricky to update it because it has no true settings. The settings look just like chrome browser settings, it really doesn't tell you any specs of the computer on the settings. But \"how to's\" on updating are everywhere and once you do update it it works perfectly.\n- Home wifi connected instantly, but my first time connecting to a wifi with a login(like at college) was troubling. But after my first experience at connecting it(when I finally got it through), anywhere else that needed a login for the wifi was smooth. Home wifi's connect like breeze. You will ultimately have no trouble with the wifi.\n-Even though most apps require internet, you will find a good amount of offline apps.\n-No skype but you can use google hangouts which is not bad once you get you used to it.\n\nFinal Verdict:\nYou have to know what a chromebook really is before you buy it. Do you research and search its functions. For its functions it does what it does perfectly. Only reason I gave it a 4 out of 5 stars is because the lack of functions. Avoid if you want a laptop with high amount of functions, such as downloading programs, having dozens of movies, games, torrenting etc."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "This Snow White HP Chromebook 14 is my first foray into the world of Chromebooks, and I must admit, when I first purchased the laptop almost a year ago I was a bit nervous about the restrictions of Chrome OS. I wasn't sure how difficult it would be without iTunes and other offline programs. However, when I picked mine up in the store (sorry Amazon, I got mine before they were even available on here), and opened the lid for the first time, I knew this laptop would be the one for me.\n\nMy first surprise I found in Chrome OS is the amazing suite of Google Apps that are able to do SO MUCH for free of cost. For example, Play Music allows you to upload 10,000 songs onto the cloud, and from there can be played practically anywhere (Chromebook, iPhone, Android, Windows, Mac, etc) absolutely free of cost. For comparison, Apple offers iTunes Match, which costs $24.99/year and is only exclusively available Apple's ecosystem. This is just one of the many perks of Google Apps (I won't even bother getting into Docs, Sheets, and Slides).\n\nThe performance on this Chromebook is one of my favorite things about it. I purchased the the 16GB model with 2GB of RAM nearly a year ago, and believe it or not, the Chromebook is actually faster now than it was when I purchased it. This is due to Google's consistent and routine software updates, which work entirely in the background and saves you the headache you may recall having if you are/were a Windows user. I consider myself to be a power user (on the scale of Chromebook users, at least) and the device chugs along smoothly and consistently. The only time I notice lag is if I have several graphic-intense tabs open simultaneously, but once the pages are loaded scrolling is quick and buttery, just like normal.\n\nThere is reason to be concerned about the Snow White model in particular, however. The biggest question about this color is, \"will the white fade/smudge easily?\" Well, the answer is both yes and no. After carrying this laptop around with me for so long, and purchasing a carrying case for it (which happens to be made of black cloth on the inside), I must admit I have noticed a lack of luster, but it doesn't make the experience lackluster. (Sorry, I had to.) The white color, when first purchased, was flawless, and it continued to be for several months. Now, I notice the laptop picks up smudges more easily than it used to. However, these smudges can easily be removed with a microfiber cloth, just as you'd expect. No different from any other laptop, really.\n\nRegarding the color choice in general, I realize that many are skeptical of HP's unapologetically different color choices for the Chromebook 14. I chose the white because it looks futuristic, classy, and a break from the boring black, silver, and gray colors that dominate the laptop market today. I do not exaggerate when I say that every time I use this device in public, someone approaches me telling me how much they love the look of my laptop. And with good reason: this Chromebook reasonates a similar form factor of early MacBook Airs, packing a big display (for a Chromebook, at least) into a super thin profile.\n\nSpeaking of displays, the HP Chromebook 14 offers a generous 14-inch display, just as the name suggests. Pixel density (clarity) is alright, but could be better; however, HD video is still available at 720p. Text is clear enough to write essays for hours without significant eye strain, and is suitable for the casual browsing experience of the average Chromebook user. There is one single complaint I have about this laptop, though, and it lies in the display. The screen's viewing angles are absolutely horrible, and it's something I notice nearly every time I use the device. I often have trouble balancing the screen so that the top isn't washed out and the bottom isn't blacked out at the same time. This especially becomes a problem when trying to view photos or video, and it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to find an accurate color balance across the entire display. Frustrating to say the least.\n\nHowever, I realize that a budget laptop comes with budget compromises, and when I look at the what the laptop has to offer as a whole compared the price, I am still far beyond satisfied with this product. HP did a wonderful job of balancing out features and quality where they are important and where they're not. The company made sure to make design and functionality a first priority, rather than packing in feature after gimmicky feature like their competitors do.\n\nAre Chromebooks for everyone? Of course not. However, I would still recommend this laptop to anyone who is mildly interested in purchasing a Chromebooks, and although this model is nearly a year old now, I still wholeheartedly believe that the HP Chromebook 14 is still the best Chromebook on the market."}

Do not purchase this device if you do not have consistent internet access or will need to use it often offline. This computer is a great buy for the price and perfect for a student computer."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "I just purchased this item refurbished on Wednesday September 24. It arrived promptly on Friday September 26 and once I opened it, I immediately loved it. The look and feel of the device is very sleek and it is very light. Much lighter than my old HP pc laptop from 2010. I bought the turquoise edition and although I was expecting it to be metal/metallic, I actually like the matte look of the color. It certainly stands out. I must say that starting up the Chromebook is the fastest computer start up I have ever experienced. Everything is done through your google account  and wireless so once you put in your internet password and gmail address, everything from your favorites to your most visited sites is on the computer instantly which I loved! Being a college student I have a lot of saved sites and bookmarked pages that I was worried that I would lose if I switched computers. But that worry was unnecessary. There are some downsides to the chromebook like not being able to use skype or itunes on the computer but it does have Google hangouts which are almost exactly the same as skype and I just use pandora or spotify for music streaming. I did decide to keep my old laptop as an itunes library only, so that is how I keep my ipod up to date. I know that you can use Google Play music as essentially the same thing though.\nWith the Chrome OS platform, everything is done through google chrome. While you can't really have Microsoft office, Google docs is, in my opinion, an even better alternative. Everything you make whether it be a document, a power point, or an excel spreadsheet is immediately uploaded and saved to google drive or dropbox no matter what. No more losing papers or projects and having to redo them. Also, with Google docs you can access all of your work from any device anywhere. It's wonderful and extremely useful. Especially if you are like me and need to access documents all the time on campus or other places than in your home.\nThe only downside is that you can't download software to put on the computer because it is all down through wireless and applications. All I really needed out of a laptop though is word processing, internet browsing, and media streaming. For those needs alone, this device is wonderful.\nI love this product so far and I expect to keep loving it. I would definitely recommend this item to users who need internet, word processing and music streaming or movie streaming (netflix, etc.). I highly recommend this device to other college students as well. Great price, great platform for my needs, and great user interface. I'm very impressed and very happy with my purchase."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "Bought my HP Chromebook 14 (Snow White) on April 3 2014 and have used it almost exclusively for web browsing and email. It boots in 7 seconds and the Chrome browser is lightning fast regardless of how many tabs I have open. Since it runs only web apps, it is virtually virus proof. The keyboard is well designed and does not make noise, however I wish the keyboard was lighted as the lower case letters on the keys can be hard to see in low lighting conditions. The battery lasts  9 hours during Netflix streaming. The 16 gig SSD with DDR3 memory is perfect for web apps and browser. The touch pad is large enough to all gestures and the left click and right click feature is internal to the lower portion of the touch pad so there are no exposed buttons to press. Two USB 2 and one USB 3 ports are standard along with a Flash card port for extra file storage. An HDMI port is also included. I have had no issues with this laptop  except some video formats (AVI) will not work with this laptop's native video player. Having a Linux based operating system (Chromium) that has been stripped of practically all Linux features, I wish this Chromebook 14 had dual boot capability for either Chromium or Linux so I would be able to use it for a much wider range of applications. However, this Chromebook 14 does it's thing amazingly fast and being the same size as most x86 laptops makes for a very comfortable transition. I with this Chromebook was available 7 years ago when I bought my first laptop.\n1-1/2 years later.... This Chromebook's operating system crashed and will not recover by using the HP recommended procedure.

This is probably not a great computer for someone who needs to write or do work where there isn't wifi or power.  I'm not totally sure I trust the app for writing and saving off line.  If I really need to do some sort of update and don't have wifi I use my note 3 to change something on line.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "I've never had a laptop because of no real reason to travel or move around \"plugged in,\" but decided, in an effort to stay current and because I love tech toys, to purchase an HP Chromebook 14\" as my introduction to 1) a simple laptop and 2) a non-Windows operating system. Time for a change!\n\nThe upshot: I like it! It's not perfect and is still evolving as a relatively new product, but the potential is there.\n\nPros (as of 1+ week of usage):\n\n-- The 14\" screen is nice and I'm glad I didn't select any of the 11+\" versions. Ctrl-+ is my friend, so the more screen real estate, the better.\n-- Also glad I got a refurbished Chromebook because it's predominantly solid state and I believe naturally less prone to failure than a regular PC or laptop. Saved some bucks buying refurbished, of course.\n-- No need to download/pay for virus protection. I especially appreciate that now because the Norton on my PC expired yesterday and renewal is triple the price from last year (from $20 to $60--really?--forget about it!).\n-- Nice keyboard and touchpad. I actually purchased an external mouse to use with the Chromebook but so far have not wanted to use it; the built-in touchpad is responsive and easy to use.\n-- All the free apps. One of the first I downloaded was Adblock Plus (absolutely wonderful and great fun to see ads disappear from favorite websites), then a dictionary and then MS Word Online. Haven't yet tried MS Word Online and hope it works. Many of the available apps seem to be amateurish and/or useless, but for a long-time Microsoft user, it's a treat to be offered *anything* for free, so no complaints here.\n-- Long battery life (8-9 hrs depending on what you're doing) and recharges quickly.\n-- To be free of Microsoft and its downloads, alerts, viruses, etc.... Need I say more?\n-- Pandora and videos. I've been wanting to listen to Pandora and watch YouTube videos without using my power-sucking desktop PC. The Chromebook uses far less power than a desktop, so I consider it a \"green\" choice if you want it to double as a home stereo or viewing system. Which leads me to...\n\nCons:\n\n-- Sound quality is acceptable but I prefer a deeper, richer sound, so have purchased a $20 set of USB speakers compatible with a Chromebook. Shipping now! I also ordered a carrying case, which of course doesn't come included with the Chromebook.\n-- Screen glare is extreme, which makes working outside a strain on the eyes. What were they thinking?\n-- The built-in Google image editor is so rudimentary as to be useless. I haven't yet checked the built-in Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides, but wouldn't be surprised if the same holds true. But, this is where the Apps will come in handy.\n-- There *is* a learning curve if you're going from a Windows to Chrome operating system, so do avail yourself of the online help. I have yet to explore the instructions for connecting my classic printer to Google Cloud Print, and only today figured out that Enable Tap Dragging under the Accessibility configuration setting must be set if you want standard drag/drop functionality.\n\nI'll probably update this post again in a few weeks or so, but so far, so good!

It was almost an impulse buy though I had researched them. I already had a notebook, a tablet, and a smartphone. Would I regret buying another (sort of) notebook?\n\nNO! Emphatically no regrets! I'm writing this review on my Chromebook. I use it EVERY day, usually several times a day. My notebook and especially my tablet get very little use now. If all you want to do is email, light content creation, and general web browsing, you can do it all on the Chromebook, with ease. Actually unless you need to heavily use \"Office\", or do a lot of (graphically) heavy content creation, you may never need another notebook. The Chrome OS took a little getting used to, but not much. And there are countless Google apps out there that I haven't even begun to take advantage of. And it has ports (USB, HDMI, card reader) unlike my tablet, and of course the advantage of a full keyboard. The advertised boot time of 7 seconds is REAL. My machine sometimes boots faster than that. When I use my \"normal\" notebook now, it seems like it takes an eternity to boot. Battery life is excellent. I use this thing all the time and only charge it once week. It could easily go 1 to 3 days longer, I just don't like to let my battery get too low. Very light too, easily carried. My \"normal\" notebook isn't really heavy at all, but carrying this thing makes it seem like it is.\n\nThe Chromebook is pretty much an online only machine though, so if wifi isn't available, you might not get too much use out of it.\n\nIn short, if you use it for what it DOES and don't need what it doesn't do, or if you are looking for an inexpensive 2nd notebook, you cannot go wrong. Be careful though, it may become your primary notebook ;-)"}

My only issues is that it is it's own operating system so you only have their choices of app's for instance chromebook has \"Hangouts\" their form of facetime so basically your friends and family have to have a google email account and download the app to use it. My daughter has an iPhone and she would just rather use facetime then go throug the trouble of telling her friends to do that.......but she's 12 someone who's older would probably not think that was a big deal. I think you can still download Skype we haven't tried yet. The case it's self is plastic so  I would recommend a case cover we are in the process of that they do not make a keyboard cover which again I recommend. We did order one buts it's not for the HP but the keys on it are exact I can't remember what computer it was for, it say the chromebook but they make different model chromebook like acer has a chromebook anyway we bought the key pad and it's just a wee bit off. Also remember it is it's own operating system so you may not have t he options you would with a windows computer. All in all I like it she bit the white, I do see I top getting dirty it's a Matt finish so I think dirt will stick easily so again I highly recommend a cover. Also I do wish they had more keyboard cover options as well as case options. Again it's still a good product not disappointed. Just so research on what you are buying and make sure it will work for you and your needs."}

He was always getting viruses or having to send one or the other back to the manufacturer for work.  When I realized that 99% of his time on the computer is spent reading emails, doing facebook, surfing around etc. I thought a chromebook would be a good choice for him.\nI chose the HP 14 because of truly full-sized keyboard and larger screen. I also liked the colors but he could care less and probably would have been happier with black or gray.  He uses it every day and loves the battery life on it and how quick it charges up.  He like that it takes almost no time to boot up at all and is 100% virus free.\nHe loved his so much that I bought one for myself. I use it constantly and have practically retired my tablet since getting the chromebook. If you understand that this isn't designed for high productivity (though you CAN do a lot with Google Docs apps) you should be very happy with this!"}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "4/29/15 Review Edit: I wasn't ready to give up completely on my Chromebook so we called a computer repair shop. We were told that they don't work on Chromebooks because they are so low end that it would cost more to fix it than to just buy a new one. He did offer a solution though. He told us to remove the battery, plug in the charger, then plug the battery back in. The problem is, the battery is inside the Chromebook, so I had to basically remove the cover to get inside. A daunting task for someone who doesn't know what she's doing, but I was willing to try. Here are the basic instructions and I will post a photo to go with the instructions.\n\nFirst, remove all of the screws from the bottom of the Chromebook. Just so you know, there are 4 hidden screws underneath some little rubber stoppers. There are two round rubber stoppers right in the middle of the case, and two oblong stoppers on the edges near two corners. Take out the stoppers and then remove the screws.\n\nVery carefully remove the case from the keyboard. It kind of snaps together. Just pull the edges of the case down and away from the keyboard. There are two Tape connectors that go from the keyboard to the computer. These may or may not pull out. If they do, don't panic, everything is fine. I have circled the areas where the tape connectors go in white. Just make sure they are put back in before you close the case. Just stick them in and flip the little latch over the top to hold them. But don't worry about that yet. Let's get that battery taken care of. I had no idea where the battery was, but after looking at other schematics, I was able to locate it.\n\n I have circled in red the plug that goes to the battery. That's the plug you want to remove. Pull the battery plug out, and then connect your Chromebook to the battery charger. This powered up my Chromebook within just a few seconds. Once that is done, plug the battery plug back in. Now unplug your Chromebook from the charger and start putting your Chromebook back together. Remember to make sure the tape connectors are back in place on both sides. Snap the keyboard back in place. Plug the charger back in if you have no charge, and test everything to make sure it's working. Make sure the keyboard and the touchpad are working. If not, you didn't get the tape connectors back in place. Check them and try again. Once everything is working properly you can put your screws back in and you're good to go until the next time. Well, so much for that. Amazon won't post my photo with my review, so I guess You're all on your own.\n\n4/28/15 EDIT FOR THIS REVIEW: My Chromebook is dead. Just quit for no reason. It won't power on, it won't charge, I've tried everything I could find on the internet to fix it with no luck, and none of Hp's help links work on their website. While researching the problem I found a lot of people complaining of the same exact problem. I DO NOT recommend this HP Chromebook.\n\nI went back and forth as to whether I wanted to get a Chromebook or a Laptop. I really only needed something that I could take into my studio or sewing room that would allow me to watch \"how to\" videos on Youtube or other websites, and also to do quick searches on techniques I am trying etc. For that, this Chromebook is all that I need and I am glad I chose it over the laptop.\n\nYou can also view photos, PDF's etc on the Chromebook off of a USB storage device. I haven't gotten into much of the technical side it yet so I haven't pushed it to see what more I can do with it. For now, I just needed something for looking up patterns and other info to help me complete whatever project I am working on at the time. Sometimes I play games on it.\n\nI got the turquoise, and I really like it a lot. It's not too big and bulky. Chromebooks are more just a glorified search engine rather than a real computer. But it's all I need and I would recommend it to anyone who just needs a portable web searching device.\n\n(EDITED)\nI am editing my review and knocking off two stars because the sound on this Chromebook sucks. You can barely hear videos which is the whole reason I bought it. I have since, tried connecting it to headsets and external speakers, both wired and unwired, and Bluetooth with absolutely no luck at all. Now I am just frustrated with it."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "The battery on my Kindle Fire is nearly incapable of holding a charge any more, so I began looking at alternatives.  My eyesight has changed a lot in the past few years and I wanted something bigger.  I decided on the Chromebook because all I really needed was something I could tote around the house with me.  I'm done with little tablets.  I need something I can see.  The price was extremely reasonable.\n\nI had not anticipated how much I would love this format.  It has been a long time since I accessed the software and files stored on my desktop.  Almost everything I do is web based.  In addition, I've been using Chrome for years, so I already have a base from which to start.  My experience using it is nearly identical to the experience I enjoy using my desktop - except that it's portable.\n\nThe HP is attractive and the build quality seems quite high.  It's pretty lightweight and the screen is sufficient for the tasks I ask it to perform.  I can access all of my Amazon content from it as well - which is why I had the Fire in the first place.  It is much more comfortable to use.  There are some ports that I haven't had the need to use yet.  With the Bluetooth on board I can do all kinds of things.  It's been really flexible.\n\nIn terms of performance, I have had no issues.  Set-up was quick and easy.  The battery holds a charge for days (if you're a moderate user).  I have had no need to turn it off or reboot it."}

But the price was right and the color is super adorable. I'm in highschool and this is very useful for all of my homework assignments.

It does 99% of what I bought it for, but there are a few shortcomings that have disappointed me. I can go to NBC Nightly News online and try to watch the latest news broadcast. The advertisements will play, but the news doesn't. I don't understand this. I tried downloading an app to fix it, but I can't get it to work. My work around solution is to try and find recent news on Youtube or simply resort to my iMac for news.\n\nMany of the apps are merely shortcuts to web pages. I already have bookmarks to the pages I use, so these apps are a waste of time.\n\nI was disappointed that Google Earth doesn't run on a Chromebook. It runs on PCs, Macs, Linux and other devices, but NOT Chromebook. I don't like it's inability to zoom in on a photograph and see it at full resolution (1:1). Or sometimes magnify an image.\n\nI set up Cloud Printing, but and it worked once, but then my Brother wireless laser printer stopped working with my other computers and now I need to reset the whole printer for wireless again.\n\nFor most things, it is just what I needed for around the house and some travel. I love the speed at which it is ready to run. The battery life is very good."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "2 big limitations that I made my decision to return this:\nThe Chrome OS will not allow any 3rd party apps.  Important for us was the coupons.com extension to save money at the grocery store and Target.com's coupon printing extension.  I'm sure many other retailers coupon software would be blocked as well.  Chrome has some alternatives but they cannot compete.\nThe google print to cloud issue.  Unless your printer is a \"cloud printer\" you will have to link it to google print cloud.  You have to do this via a non-chrome computer.  If you don't have another computer connected to your printer, you can set the printer up in google cloud print.\n\nThis Chromebook  boots nuts-fast and we had no problems at all with surfing, playing videos, set up.  But I need to use certain web extensions and I don't have an alternative computer in the house to manage the printing situation.\n\n4 stars because it does what is says it does.  just wasn't right for us."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "I absolutely love this Chromebook. Honestly it surprised me. I'm 20 years old, I'm a full time student with a full time job. I have a very simple lifestyle all I need from my laptop is too be able too access the internet, be able too let me online shop and check emails and also too be able too use word documentations. Now This laptop surprised me because when i powered it on, it took the memory of my Hp pavilion which was on but I wasn't using it at the moment. All my bookmarks were there on my browser and honestly I loved that. A little creepy as too how that happened but I love it!. The color is beautiful its more of a Matte color than shiny and you can see sparkle in it if you look close enough. Its gorgeous. I'm not really a social network person so or a gamer so I cant elaborate on its uses with that. This Chromebook is light weight and hasn't even gotten the slightest bit warm yet. I bought this for when I move into my new apartment (7 months from now) but i just cant help myself i love this Chromebook. Way better than the other three laptops i still own. Which are an Hp pavilion, E machine and a Hp windows 7. Also you'd have to be a klutz too drop this laptop because its design for some reason gives you no room for those type of errors. This was perfect for my busy lifestyle so if you are a go getter just looking for a computer that won't get viruses or fall apart on you I'd suggest this laptop. No real maintenance required. Also i have too add those people who say their is no right click and printers cant be set up too it, obviously you didn't go through the \"get started\" app in your apps its right there next too the files app it takes 5 minutes too go through and shows you how too do everything that's necessary. so giving this product a bad review because you didn't learn how too follow directions before you throw a temper tantrum is just b.s but too right click u simply just press the touch pad with 2 fingers. your welcome."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "I've been fairly impressed with the Chromebook as a whole. As more applications move to cloud-based infrastructure, items like this become more a more flexible option in the home and at work.  While there are some limitations, I find this has been an excellent option for our teenager.  The larger size makes it ever more appealing.\n\nCons: With any Chromebook you are limited in applications.  There are many cloud-based options, but some are not fully developed yet (M$ Office). My other grip is the lack of a master account or parental controls. I have other means of doing these things, but an \"on-board\" option would be best.\n\nPros: Great price point, easily configured and deployed, very intuitive."}

If all you do is surf, work, and play on the internet, this is more than adequate.  Works well with a Chromecast to show movies on your tv.  Great integration through the apps if you are invested in the Google ecosystem (Gmail, Play, etc.)  I prefer using this to a tablet, in fact, I got rid of my Galaxy Tab and use this everyday.\n\nOnly issue I've encountered was the touchpad no longer functioning after a couple of months, chatted with HP and they sent a box to ship the Chromebook back to them.  They had to replace a cable for the touchpad and returned back within a week.\n\nHighly recommend!"}

Now, I can see why they love their chromebook.\n\nThis fits perfectly for what my online browsing and watching movies and shows. I have found this easy to use. The touchpad takes some getting use to, but once you get the hang of it there's no issue there. Although if you want to use a mouse it's feasible but for myself, I found it didn't work as well even when I changed the speed of the mouse. I don't have any issues with the keys. They're perfectly fine for me. The screen is a great size and the images come off beautifully.\n\nI have read some other reviews speaking about the speakers and how they're average or not the best quality. So I was quite surprise at how clear and loud the sound came from them. They're actually better than what was on my last laptop.\n\nThe only issue I had was during the first couple of days upon getting the chromebook, the screen would freeze and then shut down and start up with a message saying that the Chrome OS is damaged or missing and I had to reboot the system. For a time there, this kept occurring. It got to the point where I thought I would have to return/exchange this for another one. It got to be a little frustrating especially considering I just got it. But I'm glad to say that since then I haven't had the issue again. If it happens again it wouldn't be a big deal to reboot it again.\n\nI'm not really technologically savy. I basically just browse the internet and watch movies and shows. So with that said, this chromebook is perfect for me. I enjoy its easy use and how light it is. I also like the color options available. All in all, I am very happy with my first chromebook."}

My iPad was deficient and clumsy to use for my small business, and I only had my Windows machine from my work, which I did not want to use for personal business.  And WOW...totally impressed with this Chromebook.  LIGHTENING Fast, 'instant on', and I am doing everything that I need to with the look and feel of my Windows, with none of the hassle of virus checking, downloads, updates to O/S etc.  I am in the processing of uploading all my docs stored on a local Windows drive, so they can be easily accessed from the cloud (and auto backup too....anyone out there concerned about losing ALL your digital pictures you've been collected for over a decade?  hmmm? hmmm?).  Listen,  am not a 'power user'.  I don't need to edit videos, do advanced image work, or lay down a drum track on a song.  I just need to do light computing, and access the web, grab a Netflix movie when bored...Do my QuickBooks etc.  No virus SW to buy or update, no O/S...no HDD to crash...and unless you do backwoods camping or climb the Alps...you can find internet almost anywhere.  And that's what this machine needs all the time.  A network connection either via WiFi or hotspot.\n\nSpecifically about this HP:  Love the color (Peach)...easily found in the house and just plain cheerful.  Super smooth surface, and the 'chiclet' keyboard has an interesting feel...almost a very light light sandpaper feel so your fingers don't slide off easily.  THe 14\" screen is bright and sharp (sharp enough for my eyes at least).  Nice layout across top of really useful buttons such as expand/reduce the screen, very easy volume and mute buttons, None of this F1-F12 stuff.  If you haven't tried a Chromebook...its INSTANT on.  It has taken me a few days ot get used to the keyboard layout, as I am looking for HOME/END/INS....they don't exist or I haven't them found yet.  And there is no real 'double' clicking' or 'right click' to bring up a submenu.(more learning still to go, it might be there but I haven't found it)  So slight adjustments needed from a straight Windows machine. Do watch for this >>> A few of my on-line based applications (Quickbooks Online for example)...kept telling me that my browser was not up to date.  What?  How can that be?.  Look over in your lower right corner by the clock.  Sometimes...just sometimes...an update does not load properly.  Look for an ICON that will 'restart' your update.  Boom baby, problem solved.

Google Music - I can listen to my personal music from any device\n\nThe Explanation\n\nI bought a chromebook about a month ago now. Now let me say I started off thinking that I wouldn't like it; it has to be connected to the internet, you can't download any programmes unless the come from the App Store, the memory is limited, and a bunch of things that don't sound too great for a laptop.\n\nNow I started doing some research on chromebooks and saw the google trailer and of course I'm still skeptical. They mention that computers are just for the browsers and I'm thinking \"well no, there are always those small programmes you'll need.\" I'm sure for an average person it might be a fine substitute as it is really cheap and does it's job well. But I thought it wasn't really for me, and I'm a computer engineer so I thought I needed to have a good computer where I can download all the different programmes that help me in my field.\n\nBut truth be told, I was tight on money but needed some sort of portability with the upcoming semester as I'd spend most of daytime traveling around the city (and I wasn't ready to slap a battery on my desktop and drag it along.) So I bought it thinking I'd use the return policy time frame as a trial period. I didn't expect much from this computer at all.\n\nThe result\n\nAfter the first day of using it and just merging it into my life, I fell in love with it's functionalities. It really forces you into google's interconnectivity and makes you realise how a computer using only web apps can be fine...for a secondary computer.\nI've put a Crouton Linux OS so I could download some programmes and small games to kill time I've got off. Gives it the functionality of a cheap laptop right ?\n\nThis is why I give it a 4 star rating.\nThe memory for most chromebooks in this case 16gb really shuts you down after a small a moment, I'm putting some pictures on there from my camera as it is the only portable computer I had and as soon as you hit that 13 gb part the computer will start severely slowing down and saying how your files may be deleted as they should technically be temporary.\nThat's fine, I see the point in that since it's really are so that the computer can run at high speeds\nSo I put in a 16 gb sd card and that's what made look up the specs; this computer does not have the power to transfer or read files from external storage. Even with the USB 3.0 it will take you awhile.\n\nIn the end - Chromebook 14\nSo I highly recommend this model to anyone who just needs a computer for light work on the go for a low price and a desktop computer for \"heavier\" workloads.\n+You have all functionalities necessary for the average student (google's and microsoft's version are both available)\n+You can code of course with some very nice apps that act a bit like notepad++\n+it's fast and it will stay fast for a long time with prosper care of course\n- file transfer is very slow\n- limited memory space"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "I did a lot of research before buying the HP Chromebook, and I have to say that after owning it for a few months, I am finally starting to realize it's potential. I love the blue tooth for audio & video, and it is quick at waking up and turning on. I can quickly check emails and social media. The battery life is really awesome as I can use it most part of the day without worrying about having to plug it in. If you are an Android user the Chromebook can easily communicate with your phone without having to attach it. It's a little weird to get some notifications on your computer that you expect to receive on your phone.\n\nThere were a few things that I had to get used to. First of all, iTunes is not compatible. But if all of your music is attached to an external hard drive you can easily upload it to Google Play, which then can be available on all your compatible devices. Second was having faith in the Google Drive, most of your stuff will be stored there. If its important or personal, I just save it to my external hard drive. Files can be easily opened from old files from another computer. All of my old files worked fine with the Chromebook.\n\nSome things that I was worried about before buying this were the reviews of the screen and glare. I'm not a pixel geek, so I think that the screen is great, and the glare of the \"shiny \" screen has not been a problem. But I have only used my Chromebook indoors.\n\nOverall here are my favorite features:\n*Runs fast\n*Great for Social Media & web\n*Compatible with several devices\n*Great Price\n*Slim Design\n*Easy transition from laptop\n*Battery Life"}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "I literally just got this laptop today so i cant give a super in depth review on it, but i can give a first impression.\nUpon opening it, it  looked like one of those slim mac book air laptops, which I LOVE! Starting it up for the first time was a breeze: It asked to connect to my wifi immediatley, and asked a few more questions and i was free to use my chromebook. First thing im gonna have to get used to is the keyboard seeing as its much wider than my previous HP. 2nd thing im literally now noticing is i cant correct my spelling errors by right clicking on the touchpad, not sure why, but will look into that. The main thing I use a laptop for are: surfing the web/social media/youtube etc, but i also use it to go on skype/yahoo to video chat.....unfortunatley this chromebook does not allow skype/yahoo for whatever reason which is a huge disappointment. Why have a laptop/notebook that comes with a high quality webcam when you cant use it for skype or yahoo? The other CON of this chromebook is that its not like your standard laptop where you can click the \"Start\" button and you have all the features that come with your laptop. It literally only comes with google chrome for web surfing, a gmail shortcut button, and a youtube shortcut button. If you want to add apps to your chromebook, you can by surfing the chrome web store, which offers tons of free apps to download. I personally wish this actually had the usual \"Start\" button and computer default accessories on here. One more tiny CON, is i cant seem to find the \"page down/up\" button for fast scrolling. For now I just have to press \"alt\" and the down/up arrows for faster scrolling.\n\nWith all that being said, i do plan on just keeping this chromebook, its nice for pretty much everything, for the price. Hopefully they soon will allow skype/yahoo on here."}

I have a 13\" Toshiba and 11\" Acer Chromebook, along with the HP 14. IMO the build quality, size, keyboard, and trackpad of the HP 14 are superior to the others. If you read \"professional\" reviews of the HP 14, most of them criticize the screen/picture quality. I do agree that it is not the best picture available on a Chromebook, but the other benefits of the HP 14 more than make up for any shortcomings (the picture is more than acceptable IMO)."}

I know there is a future change-agent or inspired entrepreneur out there I can help.\n\nThe Chromebook's (and Chromeboxes) are great. They fire-up in seconds and pack a lot of bang-for-the-buck. They typically have wireless connectivity and bluetooth (this model has both). The screen resolution is fine, and the machine is sturdy and well-made by HP. Kids like the colors as well. I'm sure this is a terrific solution for adults, but its priced right for a new machine for kids from middle-school through college. Its also a good replacement machine if you don't want to spend a lot of money on an Apple, and can't bare the thought of a Windows machine. The key to success and satisfaction is based on how you feel about Chrome (not to be completely confused with Android). This browser experience has its focus on all-things Google, from email (Gmail) through internet browsing (Chrome), to how you create and store documents (Google Docs and Google Drive). The Google Play Store and Chrome Store have thousands of apps that you will recognize and help you be productive. Both are about on-par with Apple's App Store, and QA appears solid.\n\nI am still an Apple iOS evangelist. But, I feel that the Chromebook and the Chrome experience is getting more refined by the day, and is a terrific value.\n\n- Brian"}

However, the Chrome operating system has begun failing multiple times per week. When it does, the Chromebook because completely inoperable, and the entire operating system must be entirely reinstalled. Google has a handy tool that helps with this, but it takes time, and it wipes the Chromebook completely clear of all data. It's like pulling the machine out of the box again, except instead of a new computer, you get an old one that turns into a brick twice a week. Google support told me it was likely a hardware problem, so I guess I'll have to try and send it back to HP. Who knows if their limited warranty will actually cover the issue. Either way, I'm sure I'll have to pay for shipping charges.\n\nAt $300, I thought I was getting a great deal, but if I have to buy two of these every year, I may as well buy a MacBook or a Dell instead. I've had one of each of those, and my MacBook is still going strong after 8 years, and the Dell works just fine too. Sure, they cost more, but they're still cheaper over the long term.

I've been using it for a couple of months now, and in that time it has completely replaced my netbook and is currently the only computer I use.\n\nCompared to just about every other computer I've used in my life, the Chromebook is ridiculously fast and does everything I need. I no longer really need MS Office, but if I would like to use OneNote or need Word, no problem, MS has that available in the cloud (OneDrive). Videos load faster, the battery lasts hours longer than other competitors.\n\nYes, there is a lot of criticism on the Chromebook out there, but those concerns seem to be mostly written by power users. Think about it this way, how often are you using a web browser (Chrome, IE, Firefox, etc) and how often are you using everything else. The past few weeks I haven't even touched another computer.\n\nA lot of the criticisms also point out that there are cheap Windows machines in the $300 range if you really just want to cut back cost. That's true, but if they are anything like the previous netbook I had (for which I paid under $300 used), they aren't worth it. They are likely using lower quality everything. They are nowhere near as fast, and often feel cheap. Not to mention, the software costs will likely be well over $100 so it's really more like paying $400. I didn't have to spend a cent more than what I paid at time of purchase.\n\n*****NOTE: This review is for the HP 14-q063cl.

It works like a light switch, turn it on when you need it, then turn it off when you are done, that's all you ever have to do!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "This is a very decent piece of equipment for the price. Particularly, this model comes with an Intel Haswell processor, which is very battery efficient. I've been able to work for an entire day without having to recharge. It does come with an SDHC/SDXC slot where the card goes all the way in (this is handy for extra local storage, as it only comes with 16GB of built-in M.2 NGFF SSD storage which by the way, it takes a lot of laptop assembly skills to replace). As a Chromebook with ChromeOS, you are limited to installing Chrome Apps from the Google Marketplace, but for most, this does the job pretty well.\nAs another note, you can't install printer drivers to it. By default, you only have 2 options: either printing to your Google Drive (as a PDF) or printing to a Google CloudPrint-ready printer (or a printer connected to another computer with Google Chrome and shared as a Google Cloud Printer).\nIf you still want to use your network-capable printer (not Google CloudPrint-ready or shared through another host) there is another option. This involves turning your laptop into developer mode and then installing Crouton (and selecting Ubuntu Precise Core as your chroot), then installing CUPS server and then installing cloudprint package from the Universe repository)."}

I am pretty sure someone on the support told it its a known issue.  Not sure what causes it.  It came back and worked fine till this week.  Then same problem!  Problem is I am one month out of warranty now.  Everything costs to have it fixed now.  To me its just not worth the risk.\n\nThese issues really put me in a bind because my daughter uses it for school.  I need something without weird issues.\n\nI am ordering another brand today.\n\nDisregard this review below and see newest comments above:\nBeyond expectations.  I have owned or still own many computer devices over the years.  Windows desktop/laptops, Mac, ipads, Androids, Kindle's. So i have a good feel for comparisons. My child needed a laptop for school this year as they will be using a new online math program.  It needed to be fast and not too heavy to carry around in a backpack.  And also, I did not want to spend a lot. So chromebooks seemed to fit all the criteria. My initial leaning was for a Samsung or Acer model, but my daughter just loves anything turquoise, so when I let her choose from my model list, it was the only choice!  I knew this was not rated on most review sites as \"number 1\" as they say, but it did have some good reviews. And the price was lower than the others. But again..she wanted this color so I figured what the heck. Fine with me.\n\nMy initial impression. WOW.  This is just a beautiful machine, especially for the money.  We got the 2G model, again thinking it would just be used for small browsing apps.  Its seems plenty fast, quiet, runs cool, and boots and turns off quickly also.  I was a bit worried that the 14 would be a bit heavy, but I wanted the bigger size having owned smaller devices in the past and then wishing I had bought bigger.  In fact IMO its very lite. These are not your old laptops in that regard.  Compared to my Dell its just much quieter(no fan) and cooler. U can sit in bed with this on your lap, and their is no heat whatsoever, which is a annoyance with my other laptops.\n\nThe only downside i can see is the monitor and resolution.  Compared to some other devices, its just not as good. The best way to describe it, its not as \"bright.\" But i think for the price and reviews I had read, its better than expected and I would not term it a deal killer. Not bad at all.  For young eyes, I am sure its not an issue.\n\nI am writing this review on it. Set up was easy.  Just turn it on and log on to Google.  As my daughter is proficient searching and installing apps on her iphone, there is no learning curve for a chromebook.  It works the same.  Did u ever buy something on the lower end of the price scale and scaling back your expectations, and then just get blown away by the product?  This is one of those. When my laptop blows a fuse again(which it has two times)..it will get replaced with a chromebook.\n\nUPDATE:  May 2015.  Less that one year into purchase...machine boots up with blank white screen.  No way to remove the battery to try a reset...all other resets failed(based on chats with chromebook and HP)...need to send in to HP for repair....just saying....tech said that its a know issue with the chrome OS..."}

Looks and feels worth a lot more than it costs.\nIt's a 14 incher with plenty of space everywhere. No cramp typing or squinting and that's a big plus.\nScreen is wanting. Texts look blocky.

And honestly, I don't see Chromebooks requiring much power till a few years down the road.\nHD videos play without problem.

I use the computer for email, online banking, bill paying, reading the news, and shopping. The Chromebook does all that and more.  The price was reasonable compared to other types of laptops and I love the turquoise color.  When I received the Chromebook it was up and running in minutes - no need to install anything.  It turns on instantly when I open the lid and shuts off as soon as I click \"shut down.\"  No need to wait on programs to close.\n\nThe Chromebook has a built in webcam. Our son and his family live clear across the country and we \"live chat\" with them once a week on Google Hangouts (similar to Skype.)  Any one with a google+ account can use Google Hangouts - you don't have to have a Chromebook.\n\nThe one thing I can't do on the Chromebook right now is print.  You can't plug a printer into a Chromebook so I'm still using my desktop computer when I need to print something.  (The only time I use the desktop computer these days is to print.  I've almost quit using it since I got the Chromebook.)  You need a wireless cloud printer to print from a Chromebook - I've been looking at them and plan to buy one in the future.\n\nA few tips: The Chromebook is wireless.  Only wireless. You can't plug it into a router so you have to have a wireless router in your home in order for this to work.  (We have U-verse.)\n\nThe Chromebook doesn't come with a mouse.  There's a scroll wheel on it.  I'm older and I'm used to using a mouse so I bought a mouse and plugged it into the Chromebook.  Now it works just like my desktop. :)\n\nAs you can tell from this review, I'm very happy with the Chromebook!"}

I did not so much do it for the HP brand or any promotions, simply because I had had an 11\" Chromebook once before and was very unhappy with the screen size and especially the keyboard, which was not exactly the standard configuration.\n\nThe HP has a standard keyboard layout and it was a good size, which for someone with large hands was very important.  I can easily touch-type on this unit.\n\nOne thing I am not totally pleased with is the display, but that seems to be typical of CBs.  If the screen is at the right angle to my vision and I do not have a backward light of some type, it is pretty good, but other times, working the screen to avoid the glare, some parts of the screen just look not overly brilliant.\n\nSpeed is reasonable though I would recommend getting the 4gig version if you are able.  I have a memory program indicating memory and I am typically less then 1 gig.  That might be normal for a CB, I am still learning, but you always benefit from more memory.\n\nI do like the availability of ports.  I don't know what you are necessarily going to plug into it often but I do have an rf mouse that works well.  I also have a BT and I do not find the BT working nearly as good as the RF.  The RF is smoother and more consistent whereas the BT seems to occasionally drop out.\n\nIf you are looking for a CB, and maybe you already have a tablet, why get an 11\", get a 14\", you'll be happier with it."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "Yeah, like most of the other reviews, I'm a happy camper. Needed a laptop to bridge me over until the upgraded MacBook Pros come out. This is no MacBook but I didn't expect that. But it's also a much better Chromebook than I got when they first came out. The first ones were, IMHO, junk. They were built cheaply and looked and felt like it. This laptop is robust and appears to be built very well. The screen is great - easy on the eyes and the 14\" size is really pretty large considering I have been used to a 13\" screen. I can't run Lightroom or Photoshop on it nor can I run a local web server so I'll stick with a MacBook for that stuff. But I'd say this laptop can do about 70-80% of the stuff I normally do with a client in the field. The 3/4G is worthless to me because T-Mobile doesn't reach my part of the US. But I can turn my iPhone into a hotspot and use it with the laptop. I don't think you can beat the price and functionality of this machine. A definite recommend and buy!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "I have been using Windows since Windows ME back when I was in middle school plus Macbook when I started earning enough money to buy one and I love both processors. Sure, Windows have some kickbacks such as vulnerability to viruses and whatnot but being a folk who has been using Windows since the beginning, I am used to purchasing anti-virus software every year to protect my machine. Anyway, not the point of the review. Then came the Chromebook, which I have been curious about since it first came out but I never had the need to buy one because I use a lot of applications that are not available to use on the Chromebook, such as Photoshop (there may be an app for purchase, but why buy a separate app when I already paid $500+ for the software already?). However, the time finally came when my mom started watching Korean dramas using her iPhone, which I thought was a bad idea when she follows 20+ episodes a week. I suggested that she buy a laptop for this purpose so I went browsing on Amazon to find an affordable, simple, yet sturdy laptop. The idea of a Chromebook popped into my head so I started looking into the Chromebooks that came out this year. Obviously the colorful laptops by HP caught my eye. After reading the specs and various reviews online about this particular Chromebook, I became convinced that this may be the laptop for my mom, who will mainly just be using the laptop for online streaming purposes, no need for anything too fancy. Plus, HP has been a trusted brand of mine after having own several desktops made by the company. I went ahead and ordered the computer.\n\nSetting up was super easy. I was already a frequent user of the Chrome browser, Gmail, Google Drive, Google Play, and sometimes Hangout. I simply had to log onto Google with my email address after setting up the Wi-Fi network, then viola, ready to go within 2 minutes! The machine is fast, the screen resolution is clear and vibrate. Since Chromebooks are simple, the software functions are easy enough to understand. Basically clicking any apps triggers the Chrome browser and you simply do everything on Chrome. You are able to save things easily into folders.\n\nThe keyboard also provide several useful buttons including back history/forward history buttons, brightness adjustment, volume, etc. Speaking of volume, the audio is fair, nothing like Beats but not shabby. Exterior is very nice, the top shell is a sort of rubberized material while the bottom has more of a bumpy (to create friction?) hard, sturdy, plastic feel to it. The whole laptop is very thin, comparable to my Macbook Air. The feel of the whole laptop actually reminds me a lot of the Macbook Air, except for the backward scrolling (to scroll up, you actually move your fingers up the touchpad, as opposed to the opposite direction on Macbooks). Even the function of the Touchpad reminds me of the Macbook. Keyboard is a very reasonable size, not super small or super big.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this Chromebook for people using their laptops mostly for web browsing, streaming shows, checking emails, writing reports through Google Docs, etc."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "I read a good deal of information about this before my purchase. I am not a hardcore Mac lover, I think they're fine but I truly do not like Windows, so I thought this was a sufficient choice for what I wanted it to do. I do have a Mac desktop (and an iPad and iPhone's) that are used by other family members (often on and off all day for different homeschool projects) and I was looking for something for myself. No work, just play. A treat all for myself for once. I chose the HP Chromebook 14 for personal entertainment wants only. Nothing grand, checking email, reading articles, streaming (Netflix, Hulu and Amazon videos), Facebook game play (Farmville), and creating brief videos for communication. Essentially I can check email and read articles, that however is all I found it can do well, sometimes.\n\nAesthetically it is very pleasing. The battery life is exceptional. It starts up lightning fast. The price is, of course, great. It has a generous number of ports. It feels nice, physically. I do like the Google Drive space and never would have thought to use it before. I am sorry to say those are the only big pros I found. I have only had it 3 weeks and I honestly tried to love it but I just could not.\n\nFirst, my (Aqua) HP Chromebook 14, for whatever reason, has an odd pale blue hue to the monitor. I find images not as rich and often graphics are ever so slightly distorted and not very crisp. I find it uncomfortable to view after a while, regardless of adjusting the brightness.\n\nA bigger issue, Shockwave Flash is constantly crashing. As in every few minutes.\nI made certain I wasn't running multiple versions, and so on. It just fails endlessly. I cannot play Farmville, which for me is a real deal breaker since that is one of the reasons why I purchased it.  I was under the impression that integrated Facebook flash games like Farmville could play on this device. I found this to be incorrect. It lags, it chokes, it crashes.\nIn fact in my experience Shockwave Flash is crashing on pages that run flash ads or embedded videos. It just doesn't stop. Sometimes I find I am waiting (and waiting, and waiting) because it chokes, then runs, then pauses, then crashes. I never experienced this before, so I started digging and found Google Chrome doesn't play well with Shockwave Flash, at all, and a large number of people have issues with it. (check for yourself!)\nIf I am *trying* to play FV I do not open other tabs. If I am reading articles I do often open a few tabs and go back and forth between them. I got the \"He's Dead, Jim\" message for the first time using the HP Chromebook and have seen it at least 50 times (or more) since, in the 3 weeks I have had it. Though I'm no fan of Star Trek by any means (though I respect it) I immediately caught the reference and it is nothing a page refresh cannot remedy. I have sympathy for those that it startles due to lack of knowledge about the reference or the immediate fear they received a virus (FYI you generally won't know you have one in your system).\n\nStreaming videos are a pixel blur of a mess. I enjoy foreign films but subtitles are now impossible to read. Regardless of where I try to view (as in internet location) streaming videos is like a modern moving Claude Monet painting. I have paused movies and resumed them on my (or another) Mac, and the TV via WiiU, Wii and PS3, and the same movie continues to play crystal clear. Not so on my HP Chromebook 14. I have adjusted as much as I can on my end, the problem isn't my wifi, it's the Chromebook.\n\nI do not like the app system, just my personal preference.\nThe apps are neatly tucked in the bottom left corner. It's nice enough I suppose instead of all over the screen but my like for it ends there. I prefer to organize my apps to help keep things easier to find. Want to do that? Then you (oddly) need another app for that. You need a lot of apps for little things. Every time you install an app you are installing a web application that only works when opened in a new browser tab. This I do not like.\nI was hoping to be able to easily message other IOS devices, for which there are apps, of course. I find these apps pretty inconvenient, as you have to have them open and running in your browser tabs to receive your notifications, instead of a friendly pop-up somewhere. The same browser tabs that \"die\" while sitting open. If you're not following me, what I am saying is if the app tab is closed, you will not know you received a new message. Not a huge deal breaker by any means, just not as easy as what I am personally used to. I mean it's supposed to be a kind of instant message system, not e-mail. I feel that's comparable to taking several steps back with a brand new device that is intended to make things simpler. However that latter fault lies more with the app itself and not specifically the Chromebook. If you are not familiar with Chrome apps you, like me, may find them a bit backward.\n\nAnother example being I enjoy making videos. No, not Skype. I do not need Google Hangouts though I am sure it's fine as a Skype substitute, but actual brief video communications. Instead of the ease of recording a video and being able to send it in a FB message to a friend (online at different times/schedules just makes brief videos, IMHO, for a better communication experience) now I am much more limited. Sure there are video apps, (like WEVideo which is annoyingly choppy) that one would have to install and create an account to use, and then request friends to do the same. No, it does not allow to easily share videos but does at least offer the option to constantly log into the app and check for new videos received. To me that's another step back.\n\nThe amazing built in camera? I don't agree. Maybe there is something defective with my HP Chromebook. I certainly do not expect it to be on par with my year old Mac desktop, but I find the cam video and photo quality to be the same of an inexpensive laptop from years ago.\n\nI found the track pad fickle and sometimes unresponsive to double tap attempts to right-click. Luckily I was aware of this issue ahead of time and made my purchase with a USB mouse.\n\nI thought this would be more then sufficient for what I wanted. Kind of a different version of an iPad, without the IOS apps of course, but it isn't. At all. It's much, much less for me. I can't stream videos. I can't play the one game I enjoy playing (that I supposedly should be fully capable of playing, as it's a flash game on Facebook). Often I can't even load a normal page to read an article. I know I can install Ubuntu instead but I didn't buy it to install another OS. I wanted something fluid and simple. I do not feel I had any high expectations yet this left me disappointed.\n\n I think it would be good for a student or a very casual user as a second/back-up device but not much beyond that. I cannot even give it to my teen or tween, to use because they play games (Minecraft, Roblox, Gmod, Portal, Blockland, etc.) and, like the majority of their friends, Skype, so this absolutely would not fit their wants either. It's nice to read in some reviews that it did work out for others but I wanted to share my different experience. I really hate returning anything but I personally found my experience with the HP Chromebook 14 a serious disappointment and am sending it back for a refund (not replacement). Sorry HP Chromebook, it wasn't meant to be."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "I was looking for a new PC to supplement my 10 year old dell (still works fine but slow as hell n will not allow me to watch videos) went on the blink one weekend After trying everything, I finally figured out that it was over heating because there was so much dirt in the fan after I vacummed the dust out it now works fine but is still very slow. So I figured it was time to treat myself to a new PC but I wanted something portable.  I started out wanting a laptop but the prices were much more than I wanted to spend so I held off.  In addition, there is so much on the market with tablets and Ipads,( I have not had the best experience with my IPOD so I am leery about making another Apple purchase) and surface pro, it came become a little overwhelming.  I also knew I really didn't want another PC because once you begin to download stuff from the internet, and with the cookies, your pc overtime begins to run slow.  And you also have worry about virus protection. Then, one night, while browsing the newspaper, while on the way home on the train, I came across an article on the Chromebook.  The article only talked about how inexpensive it was.  I googled it when I got home to find out more info.  I was clear that it was a limited system that ran on a googles OS, but since all I ready needed was something that allowed me Internet access to check my email,bank account info and watch videos, it served my needs.  I also kind of liked that since it was a limited system that only ran on a Chrome Browser and did not allow all these downloades you did not really have the same worries about your system running slow over time and downloading a virus.  I also decided that I would only limit my Chromebook to watching videos and use my desktop for all else.  So, I checked on Amazon and came across the HP 14 inch with free 200MB of T-mobile.  I am not the most tech savvy by far so I did not really give to much thought to exactly how much 200MB relates to data usage.  I made the purchase from Amazon along with the 2yr protection plan and spent a little over $400.  It arrived very quickly (In about 3 days).  I was excited to get it open and get started playing with it.  It was a very simple set-up and the T-mobile Sim card comes pre-loaded so all you have to do is set up a T-mobile account and you are off and running.  Well, , I watched 1 5 min video and surfed the WEB for about 45 mins, then I got a pop-up from T-Mobile that I was out of data.  I went to the site to purchase additional data and purchased 1G for $10 which had a window of 30days use or loose. Over the next 24hr period, I watched maybe another 15mins of videos frm Youtube and did some WEB serfing (keep in mind that my Chromebook has been 2ndary during this time).  Well, 1 day latter I got another pop-up from T-Mobile advising I was out of data again.  This time when I went to purchase more date, the $10 offer for 1G was no longer available, it now offered 1G for $15 and was a 7 day use or loose window).  I made the purchase but knew that this was no longer a good deal for me. However, once I made the $15 purchase, I ran into another problem.  For some reason my Chromebook became super slowso slow that I could no longer watch videos..all the damn thing wld do was buffer.  I called T-Mobile about this issue they attempted to trouble shoot the issue, I was on the phone with 7 different techs for over 2.5 hrs.  Finally, the last tech I spoke with tried all that she could gave up and said there was no more that she could do, gave  me 2 phone numbers to HP and got me off the phone.  I waited 2 days for the charge to clear on my CC then called them to dispute the charge.  The CSR I spoke with placed me on hold for about 2 mins, came back and told me the $15 charge would be removed from card and there was nothing else I needed to do.  I contacted Amazon about returning this Chromebook.  Amazon set up the return and all I had to do was print the return label and the item was picked-up the next day and I had a full refund within 3days.  I then went back to the drawing board.  I still knew I wanted something portable and I really did not want a full PC because I did not want something that I had to worry about a Virus or a huge operating system that once you go to different websites your hard drive becomes slow because of cookies and all that other crap.  I then came across the Chromebox.  This sounded like it might be a good fit but upon further review, it was not, because this was a Desktop device and I wanted something portable.  I continued my research and then I came across a USB device that would allow me to use an Ethernet connection..Eureka!!!the music began, the sky brightened, I had found the answer.  Upon, further and deeper review, I discovered that what I needed was a 3.0 USB device that would give me 10/100/1000 speed capability.  I then found an HP 14 inch Chromebook without that  stupid T_Mobile for less than my original purchase.  I ordered this new cheaper Chromebook from Amazon, then went to Bestbuy and found a 3.0 USB by J5 create for $20+ tax.  I kept my receipt just in case I had a problem.  I received my new Chromebook from Amazon within 3 days of my purchase ( I did not opt for the free shipping route).  In fact, I received it on July 4th which is a holiday with no postal delivery.  The set-up is so simple a 3yr old could do it.  You just turn on your device, plug in the USB and it auto recognizes it!!! Free T-mobile could be the way to go if you are gonna buy a USB adapter that will allow you to connect to the Internet via an Ethernet connection.  I plan to us a wi-fi connection but only in case of an emergency when the Internet is unavailable via an Ethernet connection.  In any case, I am happy with my new Chromebook..connection speed is great.  I will update this review if I experience any problems."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "The HP Chromebook is very friendly, however there are a few disadvantages.  You cannot download apps from Google Play, only from the Chrome Store.  There is no CD disk drive.  I have printing issues because Chromebook does not link directly to my printer because my printer is not recognized by the Cloud.  I have to pull Google Drive up on my phone to print from my Chromebook.  So when I try to take a class online and I want to print the page or attachments, it spools to the Cloud somewhere.  If you have another computer with Windows/Mac, you will not have these problems because your printer will be recognized.  You cannot link a cable between the Chromebook and your printer.  That's the bad news.\n\nThe good news is that this is my 'go to' for Easy.  I love Chrome for searching, especially if I close a tab and later want to reopen it. No problem.  I like that it has built in virus protection, so that saves me money.  I can watch Netflix with one click!  How easy is that?  It has the Google version of Excel and Word and tutorials can be found on You Tube.\n\nThe camera is great.  It makes me look younger and thinner.  The picture clarity is better than on my new TV, especially if the movie is filmed in low light.  The Chromebook adds light somehow and dark movies are brightened.  The size, shape and weight are so flexible.  I can get into any of my favorite positions and my Chromebook is easy to access.  Long battery life so I can use it at least 8 hours between charges.  Charges quickly.\n\nI like it so much that I am keeping it and purchasing another laptop with Windows for my classes and printing.  If you are the average older citizen and want a laptop for email, search, and NetFlix, then I highly recommend this unit.  When it first arrives, all you do is plug it in and turn it on.  You don't have to wait 3 hours for it to charge up before turning it on.  It's just so easy."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "I never considered myself to be a \"power user.\" I only occasionally use heavyweight programs like Premiere or Audition, and I could live without the latest Windows games. I've got another Windows desktop in my household anyway, which I could use if I felt the need to use Windows programs. That's why I considered a Chromebook. However, it seems that most people's \"everyday\" computing isn't my everyday, and it escaped my mind because it had nothing to do with heavyweight programs.\n\nI bought this Chromebook in particular because of the screen size, the extra USB 3 port, and that it had slightly better reviews compared to the Toshiba CB35.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was that it looks very nice. All white and clean and the material isn't glossy so it doesn't need to be pampered. It appears to be well constructed; I wouldn't be ashamed to have this on the same table as a MacBook, even though it isn't really as sturdy as it appears.\n\nIt is one of the heavier Chromebooks, but there is a 14 inch screen here. I never cared about weight anyway.\n\nThen when I opened the display I was immediately shown the setup wizard. It seems someone had already turned it on before shipping it here. At this point a lot of people would be impressed by how quickly it awakened from sleep, but most people (still!) aren't used to having SSD's. Windows 8 with an SSD awakens just as quickly, so don't attribute it to the OS; it's the hardware.\n\nWhen I started typing I realized I really don't like the keyboard. I don't know how it compares to the competition but It feels worse than my old XPS M1330, and of course much worse than desktop keyboards. Travel is very short, and the keys feel undifferentiated in shape. If this is the trend of portable device keyboards, I'm so screwed. Perhaps with some major technique changes I would be able to use this keyboard proficiently.\n\nThe screen really sucks, and not because of the resolution. It's been so long since I've looked at a TN display, I forgot just how bad they looked. (The HP Chromebook 11 has an IPS display, but I skipped it because of low performance and battery life.)\n\nThen I just started trying to do my everyday things, and realized how much I needed Windows after all.\n  I opened OneNote Online to type this review: I knew how to do this and it was very easy. Nerfed versions of other Microsoft Office programs can also be found online, such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, etc. Most of the office-like work and note-taking you'd do in school should be covered by these online applications, while reserving specialized programs like MATLAB to desktops (free to use at most schools).\n  I tried to connect to my server through SMB or something. Not possible. Some people say they're working on it but I need it now. This was a dealbreaker. Even Android can do this. And before anyone says \"just use cloud storage hurr hurr,\" my internet connection isn't fast enough to be comparable to my LAN connection and last time I checked, 10TB of Drive space was not cheap.\n  I tried to type Chinese. No problem; no IME's to download. The built in Pinyin IME's vocabulary was adequate. It didn't support advanced features like typing Pinyin+strokes, e.g. \"yan<tab>szs\" to quickly find , but I didn't expect that.\n  I wanted to add fonts. Fail. According to my searches, it seems difficult, involving command line adventures, and it's not guaranteed to work.\n  I tried to close the lid while connected to external display without it turning off. Win! This is called \"docked mode.\" In this mode I can have the screen completely off and out of the way when I am at my desk. Of course an external keyboard is required.\n  I wanted to eliminate external mouse acceleration. It involves crosh, which might be intimidating for some. I said \"xset m 0 0\". I still don't know if I did it right. The mouse movements were still too slow for me, although feeling much better from the lower acceleration.\n  I wanted to add an ICC profile. Not possible. They say it's in the works. And no, it's not absolutely critical for me on a Chromebook, but IMO you don't have to be a professional to appreciate a well calibrated display. I enjoy videos much more when I watch them on a decent display.\n  I tried playing something on the Chromebook's speakers. Speech was intelligible, which is all one should demand from them anyway. Music sounds like crap; what do you expect?\n  I tried playing some sound through my HD 600 headphones, from the 3.5mm jack. Yes, it was able to drive my 300 Ohm headphones to dangerous levels, although I feel like the noise floor was very high compared to a desktop motherboard. This hissing sound is Johnson-Nyquist noise. It shouldn't be audible on good amplifiers. If you want to listen to music out of this Chromebook, I recommend using an external DAC and amplifier.\n  I wanted to set up an equivalent to Equalizer APO. It's part of my everyday. I looked in the Chrome Web Store. Doesn't seem like there's anything.\n  I tried playing some of my music. I put my music on my server, which I can't access, so I turned to my Google Drive, which had some music. I tried to get the Enjoy Music Player app to find it but I guess I put it too deep or something. Playing from Chrome works though, although obviously not my preferred way of accessing music.\n  I wanted to access my school's email. Usually I use Outlook (the Windows program) for this. I tried using Outlook Online, which didn't let me set an Outgoing Server port, which I needed to do in order to get it working.\n\nI know a lot of my dissatisfaction is from the lack of resources for Chrome OS, and some people might feel like it's unfair to give HP hardware a lower rating because of it. When you buy a computer you also buy the OS. A major reason why many people buy Apple hardware is the software that comes with it, so I really consider Chrome OS to be part of this package here. And really, is my rating that bad? I did take into account the price, in case you're wondering.\n\nIn summary, it's a well done Chromebook, but it's still a Chromebook and not a Windows machine. It's not anything bad about Chrome OS; it's just that there are so many more resources for Windows, and if you're used to them like me, you'll start taking them for granted. It's not so much the big fat programs but the little things such as what I listed above."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "After using a Windows 7 laptop with a quad core processor, 4GB of ram, and an integrated graphics card, I was fed up. With all those specs, you would think it would be a smooth experience. It was not. And I'm tech savvy, I clean out my registry, defrag the hard drive, I even backed up and restored it to factory settings. Still, I got lag with just a few chrome tabs open. I was fed up.\n\nWhich brings me to this little wonder of a machine. It has a low voltage dual core processor, only 2 GB of ram, and integrated graphics. Yet, thanks to the lite Chrome ecosystem, it cruises through everything I throw at it. I torrent music, have spotify going, tumblr, facebook, maybe 2 more tabs open, and it never skips a beat. I open the lid and it is available instantly. I stream netflix to my TV through the HDMI port, and it works flawlessly. I can close the lid and it still streams, which may seem like a trivial addition, but it really saves battery from the screen being off. Speaking of which, the battery lasts anywhere from 7 to 10 hours. I used to leave my laptop plugged in constantly, because the battery would last maybe 1.5 to 2 hours. Now I only plug it in for about an hour at night and it's ready for an entire day.\n\nI would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who is sick of windows, and can live without gaming or itunes. Or hell, use it as a 2nd computer. It's cheap enough. Viva la chromebook!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "If you use a computer mainly for email, internet browsing & streaming video, this is a great choice. It does everything I need it to do and the 14\" screen is SO much nicer to have then the typical 11\" Chromebooks white still remaining fairly lightweight compared to my old MacBook. No, this is not the ideal laptop for hardcore gamers, heavy users of office productivity suites, or those who require things like Photoshop or other Windows/Mac exclusive software, but there are numerous apps for basic photo editing/filters and document/spreadsheet creation as well as many fun games and other useful apps. When my 7 year old MacBook died I considered replacing it with a new one but couldn't justify spending $1200 on something that I only use for the internet 90% of the time. I also didn't want an inexpensive Windows laptop as I hate Windows with a firey passion. This is a perfect compromise. My only teeny complaint is the colored rubbery coating on the top. It looks beautiful and feels great but I got the white one and it picks up dirt, smudges & fingerprints instantly. I knew it would end up looking dingy so I bought one of the i-pearl hard shell covers available here on Amazon and that is the perfect solution to this problem. I got the clear one because I like the look of the white Chromebook but they're available in a bunch of colors and will keep your laptop looking pristine. Highly recommend both!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "I first became interested in a Chromebook because my boyfriend had just started an internship at Google and they just gave this same model to him. He was telling me all the benefits so I started doing my research. I'm not too tech savvy (hence the reason for the Mac) but my Mac was creeping up on 8 years old and I just started grad school. I didn't need it to check out in the middle of that.\n\nSo, that being said, I usually just use my computer for general browsing, movie and TV show streaming, and writing papers. Nothing outrageous. The Chromebook is perfect for just that. I am familiar with the Chrome browser so it was no big transition once I started browsing. I downloaded the app for Netflix and was well on my way with my shows. ITcomes with a ton of apps already downloaded onto it that I use on my Android phone so I am already familiar with them which is perfect. I was worried about the papers I write because they need to be in Word Document formatting. Google docs works perfectly for that. The documents and templates I use for school work just fine and there are not formatting changes that I am aware of. Google docs is just a much more streamlined version of Microsoft Office (even better for me!)\n\nThe computer is VERY fast since you store everything in the cloud. If you are familiar with Google Drive or Drop Box this isn't going to be much of a shocker to you. I was able to upload my pictures from my Mac (and finally organize them) as well as my music from iTunes. If you are wondering how to do that, just go to google.com/music and download the Google Play Music App and Music Manager from your old computer. You can pick and choose what music you want to pull over once you have that going. Super easy! And then it's all set to go on your Chromebook.\n\nI like the feel of the keyboard. Very responsive. The trackpad is touchy, but you can adjust that in the settings menu (which I did). The settings are very easy to understand and change. I got the Ocean Turquoise color. Not a very good representation of the color online. It looks more light blue online. In person it is a much richer color. More of a green base. But very pretty! I like the color in person better.\n\nOverall, I am VERY pleased with this machine. It runs Linux and you can't get much simpler than that. Very user friendly and streamlined. Runs very quietly and is very cool (temperature wise). Shipping was fast. Two days and delivered on a Sunday! I was very happy about that. I'm very excited to use my new Chromebook more for school and everyday computing."}

I got my HP Chromebook @ Costco for the free wifi for life deal but that deal won't last (or might get better). I added a 32gb flash card and 2 X 32gb flush fit USB flash drives. Google drive space is $1.99 per month for 100gb add Dropbox or any one of a hundred cloud storage services so storage space is nothing to be concerned about. The HP is faster than any operating system period. The second you open the lid your on. Connecting to wifi is simple and the signal is strong. If this isn't enough you can have Linux running on your book in less than 5 minutes. These devices have so much untapped potential it's ridiculous. I've also noticed that the prices are going lower instead of higher and they are constantly improving. I have this exact same HP Chromebook and I wouldn't trade it for anything, including a MacBook (which I already own) the battery life is at least 8 hours on the HP depending on what you're doing. You could easily watch 2 full length movies and have enough juice left over for some web browsing or email. It's great for traveling.

The finish also feels rugged enough to handle a few scrapes. You're not going to see fresh scratches every time you run dry hands over the lid. The build of the laptop also feels nice and sturdy. It doesn't feel like, or easily bend, like a cheap piece of plastic. The speakers are also greatly better than the last Chromebook I owned. If I have the laptop on a flat surface, like a countertop or table, the speakers really give off a good amount of sound. They're slightly less loud on a lap or bed, but they're still great!\n\nThis is my second Chromebook, and I really enjoy Chrome OS. I wanted this one due to the larger screen, but my original Acer Chromebook is still running great! That one now belongs to my wife.\n\nI use my Chromebook for web surfing mostly.

If you have an old clunky Windows laptop, get this and see how much you miss Windows after a couple months.  No updates to install, no anti-virus apps, no driver configuration, unbelievable startup time, great battery life, and unmatched security.  If you are really worried about working off-line get the 4G model with 200MB for free each month.\n\nThis is the perfect computer for your kids or parents/computer illiterate.  Updates happen automatically and invisibly and it has a \"supervised user\" accounts to help keep track of your kids online.  You can monitor what sites they've visited, block specific sites, or even create a whitelist to have complete control.\n\nAs far as hardware goes, the HP Chromebook 14 has two things going for it, that the others do not.  14\" size and 4G modem.  The 4G model even comes with 4GB of ram."}

I first saw this laptop at my local Best Buy and immediately fell in love with it. I then went home and did a lot of research on this laptop.

It is very fast, and very easy to use. I would recommend this product to anyone."}

(There is no adjustment per HP.)  All work has to be done in the cloud, you cannot even save work to the machine.  (Again, per HP.)  So the device did not suit my needs.\n\nAs big a problem, at least for me, is that the device--I assume all chromebooks--required establishing an account with Google (gmail, etc.).  I had to log-in to that account every time I wanted to fully utilize the device.  (There is a \"guest\" option but it limits use even more.)  I did not want to pay for the privilege of having Google track every move I make.\n\nI returned the device."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "I deliberated a lot before I bought a chromebook since it can't do everything that a regular laptop does. However, being a student I was leaning more towards this since I already have a laptop (too big to carry around in a book bag). Overall, I like it since it is nice and lightweight and fits into my backpack without adding all the extra weight. (My school books are heavy enough!)  The battery life is excellent! This does seems like nothing but a glorified tablet, but I would prefer this over a tablet any day.\n\nThe downside it that you obviously can't install any programs on this other than what is support through the google app store.  Sykpe is iffy on this and doesn't seem to work.  I can write to the other person but they never get my messages. If you use Word doc on a full size laptop you can use Google's version on Chromebook.  I found that if i use a USB stick and save my Word docs on it Google docs will open it and I can still type and save it on the USB stick for later use on my laptop. Dropbox also works well to transfer pics from the laptop to the Chromebook.  I have not tried any printing from the Chromebook, but I guess if you have a \"cloud\" supported printer it works.\n\nOverall, I am pleased with my purchase and the Chromebook!"}

Perfect for the technologically impaired, it's *almost* like having an iPad with a laptop interface. It's also great for techies who travel - if you dick around on your smart phone all the time, then there's a good chance you'll find this fun/useful. It's also shiny and nice, you just *want* to use it - my macbook pro is sitting in my backpack right now and will probably stay there until I have to edit my demo reel.\n\nOther stuff:\n\nThe Google cloud situation really comes together nicely in Chromebook. All the usual google apps are now little icons in the \"start\" menu. User accounts are easy to manage and there's something quite lovely about having your preferences being loaded up onto your computer - it's essentially the same as using Chrome anywhere, but on the Chromebook it feels integrated. Also a nice touch - there's a local folder called \"google drive\" which syncs with the online google drive just like Dropbox.\n\nSo far it's staying cool. I know there's not a lot of heavy lifting, but it's nice to have a laptop I can put on my lap (unlike my macbook pro). Battery also seems to last quite long though the hour estimates are wonking between 8.5 and 10 hrs at the moment.\n\nNetwork jazz is easy to deal with. Finding things like your IP and Mac address is all there in the bottom right of the screen, along with battery juice meter, chrome settings, and other stuff.\n\nMy mom *loves* the color, the feel and the speeeed. I was expecting her to balk at the cloud - but the chromebook is so simple and pretty, she actually loves the idea (phew!).\n\nI couldn't be happier with my purchase.

What I love most is the ease of access - no waiting for my PC to boot up.  I now use my chromebook 4-6 times a day, just grab it, open the cover and I'm on the web in about 12-15 seconds. Really easy and convenient and comfortable to use. The key board is easy and comfortable to use. It sits in my lap.\n  Only complaint - no instruction on how to copy and paste using the touch pad. Almost nothing in blogs online, most people say go buy a regular mouse to use. That would be hard on my lap. Finally found one message that explained how - just press with your thumb on the lower end of the touch pad, and with the pad depressed, use the index finger of the same hand to glide the arrow over what you want to copy. Then the CTRL-C keys make the copy, and the CTRL-V keys do the pasting. I'd not used a touch pad before, but it only took awhile to learn.\n  For anyone who only uses a computer for the few things I do, this is so much better than a PC, sitting in an upright chair for an hour of longer. Highly recommended. Now I can do my frequent research on the web easily. Someone should have thought of this long before now."}

Straight on it is great, but if you angle the screen in any direction you lose the picture quickly.  It is not great from the sides either.  The volume is decent, but does not go incredibly loud.  Fine as long there are not a lot of other noises around.\n\nYou also need to understand that you are buying a chromebook, not a traditional laptop.

The Office Depot associate told me not to bother.  I took his suggestion and purchased a HP with Windows 8.1 OS and Microsoft Word 2014.  I am a writer and finishing my second book. I have decades worth of research to compile and incorporate so it made sense that I needed a computer compatible with my Microsoft word files. WRONG!  That machine was a true pain.  It kept crashing.  Knocked me off the internet.  Had to reload data, etc. etc.  After 8 hours of trying to get it to work for me and my needs, I gave up.  I downloaded some word files from Windows XP onto a thumb drive and headed back to Office Depot to return the HP Windows 8.1 machine.  While there I plugged my thumb drive into the display HP Chromebook 14.  It was offline and google docs still opened my XP word files.  Sold!  I couldn't be happier.  I finished 28 chapters in two weeks.  My 2nd book is under editor review.  Even I was surprised I could work so fast.  But, the truth is this Chromebook is a joy.  The keyboard is large enough for my fat fingers so my thoughts just fly onto the screen.  Granted, I miss Microsoft Word, as it is so superior for my needs.  But, I figured out a way to write and then email my google doc files to myself.  I just open those up on my Windows computer, waste many hours reformatting text, but have a finished version to send for publication.  Hopefully, in the future I'll learn how to utilize google doc for those needs.

When I received the chromebook, I loved it even more! The color is beautiful, it's light and not too bulky, the setup was fast and easy, I was able to personalize it in many ways! I had a pikachu google home page and my friend and I as the background. The camera works great and the apps to get from the chrome web store were pretty amazing. Now, to the bad parts. I mainly wanted this computer to do my schoolwork on Microsoft Office and play games. Now, I did use Google Docs, which was pretty cool, but the games were the real problem. I've always wanted to play the Sims 3 starter pack on my computer. When I got this laptop, I didn't notice it didn't have a built in disc reader but that's okay. I knew I could just buy a portable disc reader to plug into my computer. So, my grandma tested hers out on this. It wouldn't work! It kept saying not supported by Chrome OS. So now I knew I couldn't buy the Sims and play any games on it or watch movies! I was very upset but I looked it up on Amazon and found that I could just download it directly onto my computer. Now I was reading the requirements, and I found that my Chromebook wouldn't meet the requirements! I was pretty angry, but I looked it up online. Now online they said to download bluestacks. I did but when I tried to open it, it said it wasn't supported! So I looked that up too and people said to download whatsapp and you can use bluestacks. So I did, and it didn't work! I am so pissed off at this, because even apps I download from the CHROME APP STORE didn't work! Oh yeah, and instead of a caps lock key they have a search key. So when I reached down to use caps locks, I instead opened up my search screen. And they don't have a delete key so I can't use Task Manager. And you can't put any shortcuts on your desktop because it doesn't allow you to. And you can't just minimize your Google by clicking the little line because it doesn't have the little line!

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "In short, looks and feels expensive and nice.  When it comes to doing stuff, especially the internet, it's strange having a computer that actually works!  (and, it's 2014 -- my other computers  swallowed up in viruses within weeks and become stupid).  The main problem so far is that getting stuff onto \"Google Drive\" or anywhere on the 100gb storage, borders on a trip back to the 1990s.  Nostalgic, yes, but c'mon.  I have figured that it's going to take me weeks upon weeks to upload probably about 40gb of pictures, all with a very difficult user interface.  Today, it took 9 hours to \"upload\" 200 pictures onto Google Pictures (using my external hard drive plugged into the chromebook).  It finally said \"Your pictures have loaded,\" yet they're nowhere to be found.  I've tried multiple pathways, too (e.g. loading them from my desktop straight to the cloud, loading them onto drive versus pictures, etc...).  A google search revealed that, indeed, this is a common and inexcusable problem.  I'm keeping the chromebook, but I'm going to have to have something uploading to the cloud every night while I sleep for, I imagine, about three weeks, just to get my crap onto the cloud.  Boo to that.\n\nAddendum: I was hoping I'd be able to write a positive addendum.  Finally, I was able to find the right combo to quickly upload pictures to the cloud.  Basically, I brought the Chromebook and my external hard drive to my office and, for some reason, it's loading super fast and I'm flying through hundreds of old photos.  Also, I showed my college student the chromebook today and she was very impressed.  She said she actually does all her papers on Google Docs and she can e-mail them to anyone as MS Word documents.  Both her college and my other daughter's college use Google Mail and Google services now, so I do feel for once I'm on the good side of things.  So, I'll go ahead and change it from 4 to 5 stars, although really it 4.5 because the interface is still confusing."}

On the other hand, I have never gotten any use out of the Chrome Remote Desktop: it crashes my mac and for windows, it runs slower than the 2X app anyways."}

While this keeps the Chromebook ALWAYS backed up with the user's Google Drive it can also limit portability to areas with WiFi, any prospective buyer needs to keep this in mind.\n\nQuick Hardware overview:\nThe keyboard and trackpad are both fairly well built and are easy to use for typing long papers or doing research projects. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same thing about the screen, which, while bright, suffers from horribly poor viewing angles that makes it impossible to share the notebook with a friend or colleague and is only suitable for the direct user. The lid is covered in a pleasing soft touch finish while the bottom is textured plastic, both side make the computer easy to hold. The hold and general transporting are made even easier by the notebook's general light weight. You will not find an optical drive here (Chrome OS does not support CD/DVD/Blu-Ray drives) but there are plenty of full sized USB ports and even a full-sized HDMI out.\n\nA Chromebook is designed for two things and two things only: light work such as word processing, making a quick spread sheet, or making a short presentation, and surfing the web. If you live within Google's world and use their products on a daily basis then a Chromebook is a good investment if you need a light and portable solution to a desktop but more power than a smart phone."}

Chromebook setup was super fast and easy. I find it's better sometimes to spend the extra money to buy it new and direct to ensure no hassles or problems.\n\nPROS:\nStart-up time: Roughly 5 seconds\nShut-down time: Near Instant (1-2 seconds)\nFeels solidly built\nSmooth Transitioning between Chrome Tabs, Chrome Apps, etc. - Chrome runs smoother and quicker than on a Windows machine.\nWeb Browsing seems spiffy and slick.\nThe 14\" inch is just big enough for my HUGE HANDS and still feels comfortable.\nVERY quiet and does not get hot at all, even when my pants block the ventilation holes.\n\nChromebook has a setup guide that shows you all the tricks and tips as far as shortcuts and utilizing the touch-pad.\nThere is NO RIGHT CLICK BUT you can use TWO fingers on the touch-pad to perform a right click where ever you need to, very convenient and I find it works quicker than right clicking.\n\nUPDATES are incredible. Compared to normal Windows updates, the Chromebook will restart to complete updates in nearly 5-6 seconds. So nice not having to wait to \"CONFIGURE WINDOWS UPDATES\" which can take centuries to finish and I've had crash before. This Chromebook is sweet and simple.\n\nBefore you give Chromebooks a \"bad\" review. Please do your research before hand and understand what you're buying. I did my research as far as replacement apps, determining my usage and examining all the features of a Chromebook. I'm a bigger guy so I purchased the 14\" over the smaller Chromebooks, otherwise it would be too small to type on.\n\nCONS: None so far. It's not windows and I knew that before buying it. If there had to be a CON - it would be that it looks like a MAC lol\n\nOverall: Very pleased with my purchase. I will definitely look into additional Chromebooks and the Chromebox as well. Thanks Google."}

If I'd seen it in person, I probably would have gotten the white instead.

I haven't had any problems with it, starts the minute you open it out of the box, good visuals, quick and the only complaint that I have is the monitoring of my searches that then will continually be used as pop-ups on every page I look at - extremely annoyng.  Of course, everyone monitors everything but I do hate the pop-ups.  Having a MAC for many years I have forgotten what it is like to have your screen filled with pop-up advertising.

It breezes right through my day-to-day tasks on the web, use of documents, photo editing, socializing, etc.\n\nAs with any system, you'll want to tweak it to your liking.  I'm only moderately tech-savvy, but it's still been easy with (frequently free) apps and extensions from the chrome store.  So far, I've had no problem finding everything I need.  I've found games, productivity and social apps and extensions of all stripes.  Integration with Chrome on my android phone, tablet and Chromecast has been seamless!  I love being able to move from one device to another without missing a beat.  Want to double check that Google search you did earlier?  Grab your phone with the Chrome browser installed and you can pull that exact search tab right up.  Casting content to the Chromecast is a great bonus, too.  I also love the cloud integration.  I can automatically upload pictures from my phone, documents from the Chromebook, etc. right to my Google drive.  Again, it's all seamless.\n\nAfter using my Chromebook daily for a few weeks, I've only run into one instance where I missed Java - one of the common critiques of Chromebooks.  I tried to print a coupon that I didn't notice was java-based and, of course, couldn't.  Fortunately, fewer and fewer things require Java, so it's really not a big problem.  And since Java is such a security risk, I'm *really* not sorry.\n\nThe only thing I'm taking a while to adjust to are the keyboard shortcuts you can/must use with Chrome.  Some are just convenient alternatives, but some are the only means to access a feature, like caps lock unless you customize the keyboard settings.  I highly recommend doing that.  Eventually the ol' brain will catch on to the new aspects, but until then, the help app is just a click away.\n\nThis is the first time I've worked with Chrome as an OS and it's been easy and pleasant.  This is not the only computer in the house, so on the odd chance I need access to something on a disc or really need to use Java, I do have an alternative. Still, I can't recommend this Chromebook enough!"}

Yes, there are still things you cannot do with a chromebook, like Skype and itunes, which sucks, but I suspect that very soon companies that don't want to play with Chrome OS based machines will change their tune and let themselves be compatible with Google. Offline usability is limited, but how often are you computing offline? Things like no caps lock button all have options to personalize the machine to your liking, you just have to go in and make the choices in settings. The \"search\" button can be turned into a caps lock if you really feel you need a caps lock button. There is no bloat or complications because the operating system is what you need and no more.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "I bought the Snow White version of the HP Chromebook 14 for my mom because she only needs to check her emails, Google search and Youtube. But before she will receive it I had to see firsthand how is to be on a Chromebook, is it enough for me? And, to my surprise, yes, this is enough for everything I do at home, which is basically leisure/entertainment. So, in the following review I'll put emphasis mostly on the things other people reviews didn't cover well.\nFirst, for people complaining about \"ONLY\" 16GB of SSD storage, you have an SD card slot that can accommodate SDHC and SDXC cards. I bought a Sony 64GB SDXC Class 10 UHS-1 R40 Memory Card which is perfectly functional and very fast. SDXC cards can go up to 256GB in storage so you can have plenty of space in case you want to have lots of movies/music/pictures/documents available offline.\nThe screen is very good if you don't want to share the content with other people who may not have the best viewing experience if they see it from sides.\nYou have an HDMI port so you can see the screen on a big monitor (unlike the 11\" version of this Chromebook).\nTrackpad use is almost the same as the one from the macbook air  (pinching for zooming in and out is missing on the Chromie trackpad).\n\nI was very interested to explore the Chromebook concept and see how many things I can do online in the Chrome browser environment (of course you do not need a chromebook for that). The reason I write this is that a Chromebook is as good as the apps which are available for your needs. So here is my conclusion:\n\nIn Google drive you can create documents, excel spreadsheets and presentations which are available offline. The complexity of the programs doesn't compare with Microsoft Office but can cover 99% of your needs. And this software is developing continuously.\n\nReading ebooks: you can find apps for reading in the ePub format (see Readium, Magic Scroll and others). If you bought a Kindle book then you can use Cloud Reader to open it. But if you have .mobi, .lit and other eBooks in your personal library you'll have to convert them to the ePub format with an online file converter (check online-convert.com, which can convert any kind of file from one format to any other format, this is very important to know when using a Chromebook at this stage).\n\nPicture editing: use Pixlr Editing, but for a more professional app you can use Gimp 2.8, the free equivalent of Photoshop, and it runs in a Chrome browser (basically it opens in a new browser window so when it's opened it looks like the installed software on Macs or PCs).\n\nYou can find sites online that let you edit your videos, same for editing sound if you need that. Chromebook can not open videos in wmv format but you can convert them to .mov, .avi or other compatible formats (see above, converter).\n\nUse Google Hangouts instead of Skype (If you want to use Skype (or VLC) you can install Linux in a chroot environment (Crouton), but this defies the purpose of using a Chromebook in terms of security, you have to let go old habits...).\n\nNow, can I use a ChromeBook for my professional work? Absolutely not! But as soon as I'm home, after a while, I forget I am on a Chromebook and not on my Macbook air (I didn't reach for this one for 4 days but I like it better because is lighter, well... for a price...).\n\nRemember that Chromebook is a concept that evolves in time, it's designed to get better, faster, more comprehensive and more secure as time passes. I am very impressed with what it can do today but you can only imagine what the possibilities are in a not so far away future.\n\nPS Does Microsoft have reasons to fear Google Chromebooks and Chrome OS? You bet! See, now you have FREE Microsoft Office available for Android and iOS..."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "I recently purchased a quantity of these chromebooks for the school I work for to be used by the teachers and staff. I have used my HP Chromebook 14 for almost a week now and I think I am really going to like this notebook the more I use it but there are a couple of things that nag at me ever so slightly.\n\nFirst, the RAM in the computer is not upgradeable. The models I purchased had two gigs of RAM in them and those modules are soldered on to the motherboard. This means no upgrading done by me down the road. I cannot complain a lot because the chromebooks only cost $300 but it was something that I wish I could do in order to increase the lifespan of these guys. On that note, the battery is not replaceable by the user either. Not a deal breaker but something to keep in mind if you are like me and like to be able to maintain your hardware as it ages.\n\nOn the upside, I really enjoy the bigger screen the HP Chromebook 14 has to offer. So many Chromebooks have tiny screens, which is great on battery life but make it hard to use as your primary computer when you have a lot of tabs open and like to multitask like I do. I am also a huge fan of the keyboard. Again, Chromebooks tend to have rather cheap keyboards but the key presses on this model are crisp and typing is rather enjoyable. Typing isn't quite as enjoyable as it may be on my Macbook Pro or a mechanical keyboard but for the price of this unit, I don't expect it to be. I do enjoy typing on this notebook much more than I thought I would.\n\nLastly, I really like the finish on the outer shell of the Chromebook. The white looks nice and the finish is a little bit grippy. It makes the notebook feel and look like a higher quality build than it most likely is. Obviously, this doesn't impact the utility of this computer but looks never hurt either.\n\nAlso, while this doesn't apply to the \"snow white\" color scheme, if you are interested in the \"peach corral\" color, be warned it is very pinkish. Obnoxiously so. It looks much more red in pictures but when you see it in person, it is a hard color to look at. The blue-ish color scheme also doesn't look the same in person as it does in pictures. It is more of a turquoise and less of a green. Just thought I would mention this in case potential buyers are looking at the other colors. I bought a few of each color and the white is definitely the more polished and professional looking of the three colors available for this specific model.\n\nLike I said, my initial impression of this Chromebook is that it is a nice machine and it is probably the first Chromebook I could see as a viable replacement for a Windows or OS X based machine. Nice screen, nice keyboard, I just wish users could upgrade it themselves a little more."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "I needed something to replace my old & heavy laptop that is about to give out on me. I have a tablet/pad/desktop/smartphone but prefer to use a laptop at home, it's easier on my back/eyes and this screen is vibrant and clear as a bell. The 14 inches is perfect in size, not too small not too big and feather light. Great build, not a cheap plastic feel at all even though it is plastic. Widescreen viewing at it's best, plays Netflix/YT videos flawlessly and the sound is outstanding.  Worked right out of the box, connected to my wi-fi smooth. I can surf the web & check email, listen to the radio, read e-books via the Kindle app, check weather, play games, create documents/notes/reminders. No DVD drive which I don't need, I can't remember the last time I used it on my old computer, it was becoming a nuisance actually. No downloads, doesn't support that sort of thing as everything is done in the cloud (web based) & the tons of apps via the Chrome store and the App store I use on my iphone. I was able to sync Google calendar with my iphone as well for reminders and such. No Windows environment to deal with (updates threatening to shut my machine down in 10 minutes) It can be personalized in many ways with desktop wallpaper and themes for the Chrome browser.\n\nI chose the aqua color which is nice, not too bright, it's a pastel green. The charging cord is a decent length, I'm not to sure about battery life but I have been running quite awhile on the first charge, I'll update when I run out of gas on the initial charge. There are plenty of ports (USB, HDMI, SIM). The touch pad & scrolling takes some getting use to and the keypad is a little tight but functional after some adjustment. Shortcuts via keyboard makes getting to some functions convenient, from taking screen shots, projecting your screen to an external display to toggling the cap lock & displaying the keyboard overlay onscreen. The camera is good for the price with many ways to edit photos, not sure if you can shoot video, more research on my part is needed.\n\nThere's lot's more to learn and explore about this nifty lil number so I'll get back to it and update with any issues/tips I come across. I don't miss the other OS which makes this purchase a good one!"}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "I helped my mom find a new laptop that was light and easy to use and we decided on this Chromebook 14.\n\nWhat's great about it:\n\n1. It is light and easy to carry. I purchased a padded cover which was sufficient to protect the laptop in trips to a coffee shop or on the road in a larger purse or bag.\n\n2. It does the basics well. I set up gmail, facebook and chrome for browsing and my non-technical, not-a-computer-person mom took to it right away once I gave her a quick demo.\n\n3. For older people or non-techies who do just Facebook and Internet, it's ideal. I haven't had any calls from my mom since she started on this laptop. She's on Gmail, facebook and internet. She can order things online and watch Netflix just fine.\n\n4. It has enough USB ports and connectors to do just about anything you need, like upload pics, watch the screen on a TV or save documents to a thumb drive.\n\nWhat's not so great:\n\n1. I couldn't work in Google Docs offline (something I do often in Windows and Word). That make me wonder how so many people say they are using this as a business/work laptop. It wouldn't work for me at all. I am not a fan of Google docs (probably since I have used Word for so long) but no offline document creation. That could be a deal breaker.\n\n2. Doesn't automatically connect to a printer.  You have to connect to Google Cloud Printer either a \"Cloud Ready\" printer or set up printing from a _different_ computer (PC or Mac) using Chrome to enable a \"classic printer\" to connect to Google Cloud Printer so the Chromebook can then print.  My mom will NEVER figure this one out. I find it an awkward solution when normally you can connect any laptop to a printer to print.\n\n3. I found connecting with the wireless network to be a bit buggy and not the instant connection I expected. It did get it to work and it seemed to stay connected without issues. I am not sure my mom could connect to a network as it wasn't THAT intuitive.\n\n4. I was underwhelmed by the selection of Chromebook apps available. It's a good basic list, but after using android apps on my tablets and phones, Chromebook apps seemed very limited in choices.\n\nOverall, I like the Chromebook as a glorified tablet for Internet, watching videos and email. And for people who just need a basic laptop without any bells and whistles, but that turns on and goes, this is a great option. For a working laptop for someone who needs it for work, I can't recommend it."}

Something I did not do before I purchased it, I did not read the reviews. Seemingly, I should have read more into the product. Everything is ran off of internet. EVERYTHING. There is no microsoft windows or anything. When I realized everything ran on internet, I did not like that fact. There is no actually storage, it's all cloud storage which doesn't seem that safe to me. If you were a college student on campus and used a lot of internet or had constant access, it would be great.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "The Chromebook is NOT for someone who wants a cheap LAPTOP. --==IT DOES NOT RUN WINDOWS...IT DOES NOT RUN MICROSOFT OFFICE==--  This could be perfect for someone that might not really know a lot about computers and just wants to get on their Facebook, check email, Twitter, Youtube, etc., without having to worry about viruses/malware.\n\nIt is VERY fast because it is very bare minimum.  HP did a great job with this device.  The picture and sound quality are both great, while watching Netflix and stuff from my PLEX server over WiFi.  I haven't ran into any issues (yet) connecting to different WiFi protocols.\n\nFor me, I made a recovery thumbdrive for cOS (chrome://imageburner from inside cOS) and wiped it completely, and put Ubuntu 13.10 on it.  With a little configuration (terminal),  it is a great portable Linux machine.  I installed Steam on it and am able to play some of my casual games with my Xbox controller (wireless).\n\nUPDATE - I have since restore it with the thumbdrive I created earlier. I found that I was only using it for ChromeRemoteDesktop, General Surfing, GMail, PLEX, Chromecast, etc. I'm sure as more things come out I will try them out and wipe it again. You will never have to open it up to get to dev mode (a big plus). This Chromebook is fun to play around with and see what you can make it do.  I've read about people upgrading the mSATA 16GB SSD to 128GB.  Keep in mind.. this WOULD void your warranty."}

I went from using an older Macbook and desktop computer to this because I am going to be taking a job traveling and wanted something simple, quick and light for web browsing, watching netflix, and word processing.  It does all of those things well, I can plug in my external hard drive and watch movies and listen to music for when I don't have internet connectivity.  I'm not a big fan of laptop mousepad so I purchased a usb wireless mouse and it works great.  My only beef is that chromebook cannot play local .wmv files apparently because that kind of file is proprietary to windows.  So in order to watch a .wmv movie you have to upload it to the cloud where it will be converted to a supported format.\nPros:  Starts up super quick, no waiting, no load times.\nSlick and pretty, reminds me of a macbook in its appearance.\nFeels very light.\nNice camera for video calls.\n\nCons:  Can't play local .wmv files.\nCan't play local android/windows games.\n\nThat's really about it.  For the most part I knew what this machine could and could not do before I bought it and for the purposes of web browsing and watching movies/netflix/amazon prime, it is a slick, quick reasonably priced notebook."}

The battery life is also great (8 hours).  The start up time is impressively fast, which was very surprising to me.  The only thing holding me back from five stars was that everything is an internet tab.  If you go to a game, there's the internet bar at the top.  If you open up Google's typing program, there's an internet bar at the top.  You can of course hit a button on the keyboard to make it go away, but it's still a little funny.

I wanted another Chromebook, and this was the only current gen model with a 14\" screen. It is important to remember that you have to be willing to buy into the cloud and/or Google apps to get the most out of this. Your music will be streaming, so you'll probably want to make friends with Pandora, Google Play Music, or Spotify. Google docs will take the place of MS Word or Open/Libre Office. Considering that most of us use our computers as internet machines, this is perfect. It fits a niche similar to that of a tablet, but with a bigger screen and a keyboard (and for me, being productive necessitates a keyboard). I love it."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "If you haven't completely given yourself over to the world of Google you may not be ready for a Chromebook.  Since I use Drive, Google Apps and Gmail I decided that I could probably do most of my travel and out of office computing on a Chromebook.\n\nThere are four things I want in a laptop. First I want it to turn on quickly and let me get working right away.  Second I want a great screen and keyboard.  Third I want it to be light and portable.  And finally I want it to be special.\n\nFor the price this laptop combined with the ingenious Chrome operating system does the first two points really well.  It boots in three seconds and has a solid six hour battery life.  I just entered my gmail account and it imported my chrome bookmarks and I was literally ready to start using it in seconds.  No need to buy MS Office or virus software, everything comes in the box. Unlike my Samsung Ultrabook which still wants to reboot every week and seems to need half an hour to update the operating system and virus every time I use it, this machine is very functional.  HP did a good job with the hardware.  It is solid and well built.  The screen is bright and the keyboard is very functional.  It also comes with a full sized HDMI port, two USB and a SD card reader and decent built in speakers.\n\nSo for the other two points. It is not as compact as I would like.  It is neither as thin nor as light as my Samsung Ultrabook (but it did cost about 10x less).  And it uses an old school charger with the brick sized capacitor.  I just hate those things (and they start to negate the portability factor).\n\nIs it special or fun?  No.  At least not yet.  It is very functional but so far I don't think I will ever love it but it will give me comfort knowing that if it ever gets lost or run over I only have $350 invested and none of my data will be lost."}

My old Toshiba was so slow, no matter what clean-up programs, anti-malware programs, etc. I could find. My son recommended that I get a chromebook, explaining that it is different than a regular computer, but will be fast. He was so right!  There is no wait time for booting up, just open it up and the chromebook starts up.  Moving to different websites is so fast!  Rarely is there problem opening any site - once a site was very slow opening and I got a message on the chromebook asking if I wanted to wait or to kill it. I chose kill it, and I got a screen with a sad face and text saying 'It's dead, Jim\".  That cracked me up! I really love seeing personality put into technology!  The only things I'm not up to par with yet are the photos.  You upload them to the computer where they are stored onto the cloud.  If you want to print or send one, you need to download to your chromebook to do so.  It's not hard, it's just that it takes me a little time to figure out how to do that. (I'm a senior citizen so in all fairness many things take me a little time to figure out.) I did upgrade to a cloud-ready printer, so I have no problems printing,  The Google Docs program does everything I need for creating documents.  The ONLY thing I have not been able to do download is iTunes and hook up my ipod to the chromebook. But my ipod has wifi access, so that's not really a problem either. The little time it takes to figure out how things are done on a chromebook is definitely offset by the speed at which it works. My son was right.

My daughter is thrilled with how fast it boots up.

I was reluctant to purchase another Windows 8 (not a fan of Windows 8) but wasn't ready to drop $1200+ on a Mac when all we need was a reliable way to access the Internet if our desktop was in use (by me of course). We definitely needed a secondary computer but without the thrills and frills of a Mac and more user friendly for my two boys. This definitely fit the bill. It was super easy to setup and the speed is equal if not better than our desktop. The one major downfall for us is that you will not be able to play Minecraft which is huge in our house otherwise I would have given it 5 stars. For us it works out great and the price can't be beat. I actually purchased from Walmart.com to take advantage of the FREE 2-yr T-Mobile data plan so if we need to take this with us and there's no available Wifi we now have a backup alternative. I love the feel of the Chromebook rather than the bulky and heavy laptop of our previous HP. This is extremely light in comparison and has the feel of having a Mac but without the hefty price tag. I am extremely ecstatic with this purchase and would urge anyone else who is looking for a laptop with simplicity and ease, this is for sure what you will want. Just keep in mind that it does not support Minecraft though there are blogs with instructions of running Linux but I'm not tech savvy to take that chance. If I'm not working on the desktop, my son can take over and I use the laptop to access the Internet and write product reviews such as this :)"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "Lets start with the hardware, the HP 14 is very well made for the price, it has a rubber feel plastic on the lid and sides and a great keyboard, strong hinge and looks and feels more like a mid - to high end laptop not a budget machine.\n\nSpeed - The haswell celeron in this makes it faster to browse the web than anything else I have ever used, including an i7 Windows 7 PC and Macbook Pro, nothing else loads pages faster. I've not noticed any slowdown with lots of tabs open probably thanks to the CPU and 4GB of RAM. It boots from cold in 7 seconds and wakes from sleep instantly.\n\nI run 2X client along side the chrome browser to allow me to RDP to my work windows laptop and again all runs very fast. Scrolling is smooth and the track pad is the best I have used aside from the glass one on my old macbook pro, it supports 2 finger gestures for scrolling and going back and 3 fingers to switch chrome tabs.\n\nYou can do your offline work on google docs and if you prefer to use word you can use office online as well (no offline mode for office though) It will play music and videos off line, I have some media on an SD card and you can just click them to play the videos, no connection needed.\n\nBattery life is great, I get a full day on a charge, with screen at 75% it lasts easily 8+ hours.\n\nThe worse part is the display, it could do with being brighter and the viewing angles are not great, still ok but not great, the whites can also look a bit yellow at lower brightness settings.\n\nBut Screen aside this is a great machine, very fast, very simple, and once you move all your data to google drive its so easy, I downloaded music manager on my PC and it uploaded all my itunes to google music so can be accessed from any PC, Mac, phone.\n\nIf it could be improved I would prefer a slightly smaller screen, maybe the new toshiba 13.3, but when I bought this no one had a toshiba to review or had them in stock to look and touch, you had to buy online.\n\nPrinting is easy you simply download google cloud print on your Windows machine and it adds your local printer as a cloud printer you can then send any docs to it even it the PC is off, it will just print them next time its online.\n\nI will need a Windows PC for some apps, such as Photoshop and a few other programs for which there is no alternative, but I often just connect to it remotely from my Chromebook.\n\nI sold my Windows 7 laptop and Surface RT and bought this, and I'm not disappointed one bit, i'm actually very impressed."}

There is one small problem, I can't download the music manager so the google music app doesn't work. However this computer is wifi based so it wouldn't work without wifi, so you can just use grooveshark, spotify, mog, or youtube. Also if you count on microsoft word or any other microsoft office or apple office products, this computer doesn't have those and can't get them. you can use google docs and google drive and they work just as well in my opinion. Also if you play games that need to be downloaded, this computer can't do those. Everything is online."}

It was not too difficult to get is online to use. Since I intended to use it during my business trip, I wanted to install Skype.  NOOOO... Google will not work with Microsoft to allow Skype to be installed on Google's Chromebook 14.  I returned this machine.  The return process from Amazon was smooth and friendly.  But the company did not process refund until I wrote a comment and gave the receiver's name and time to receive.

No office programs can be run on it, and Google docs and all those programs are no where close to being as good as Microsoft office.  There isn't a start menu and nothing can be saved to the desktop.  Photos are uploaded to a Google+ account and not even saved to the computer itself.  You can't use iTunes.  The only positive is probably the battery life.  If you need to do anything on a computer besides browse the internet then I would say don't buy it unless Google decides to allow Microsoft Office programs to run on its system."}

The quality is good, a little less than you would find on a macbook Air, but at a fraction of the price. I like this better than my 11\" macbook air because of the bigger screen and I'm not nervous to throw it in a bag take it out and use it at this price.\n\nAs a follow up after using the device for a couple months, the white plastic is starting to discolor in places even though I wipe it clean with a cloth daily.

I have an Imac desk top, an iphone, and an ipad.  Not in love with the ipad. I wanted a full screen and keyboad. Was worried this wouldn't sync with all my things.  I was wrong.  I use chrome on all my apple devices, and all my setting and tabs sync to my chrome book. I was able to sync my address book and use an icloud app as well. The model I purchased came with 32 g of storage but I save everything to google docs so, again I can pull it up where ever I am on any device.  I saw another review say they couldn't use home printing, but I was able to set up an app the sends it straight to my printer, and its an older printer, not an \"air\" printer.  My friend didn't think it would be a good choice for her because she wanted to be able to upload photos on vacation and edit.  There is a sd card slot, you can edit, upload to social media etc.  I have found nothing so far that I can't accomplish on my chrome book.  I watch netflix, watch Xfinity, emails, FB, word docs it does it all.  I really love it.  It starts up and closes within seconds. Super long battery life, Its pretty and light weight too.

I always want to try out the latest gadget whether it is practical or not. I have a 17.3\" laptop and it is very impractical to take to class. I decided that I wanted something smaller to take to class with more and more of my professors becoming paperless, not to mention the fact that I am highly unorganized when it comes to paper. This device has taken the lead spot of my electronics. I now use this far more than my laptop or my ipad. It is perfect for taking to class to view powerpoints and take notes. It comes with enough google drive space to make up for the small hard drive which is lightning fast. This device has more than enough power for everything other than gaming. The boot time is ridiculous at only a few seconds. The design has all the wow-factor of a macbook at a fraction of the price. At first I contemplated buying the Acer 11\", but it seemed cheaply made and was just too small to be practical. This is well worth the extra $100. The battery lasts a minimum of 7 hours under heavy use such as video streaming, but I typically get at least 10-11 hours. If I had to do it all over, I would have saved the $700 I spent on my laptop and just bought a chromebook 14."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "I like most everything about this unit such as the quality build, speed, price, the great battery life and the chrome OS interface.  However, I'm still trying to decide whether or not to return this item.  This is my third unit and the two things that I like the least about the HP 14 are the fan noise, which runs all the time and is noticeable, and the occasional pixelated screen with concentric circular lines when streaming videos.  I have had this problem with all the units to some degree when streaming YouTube, Netflix, Amazon Prime and even from a USB flashdrive.  I have not been able to find any reference to this issue in any of the online reviews or the HP website and after testing three units I find it hard to believe that I'm the only one having this problem.  I'm learning to live with the fan noise but the video streaming artifacts may be a deal breaker.  If I can fix the screen pixelation issue, I would easily give it 5 stars.\n\nUpdate:  After further investigation I found that some of my other tablets are doing the same thing...so the good news is that there is not a problem with my HP Chromebook so I have increased the rating to 5 stars.  However, the bad news is...I really have no idea what is causing the pixelation and artifacts.  Solving that issue will require further investigation."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "I had been wanting a Google Chromebook for awhile, and did a lot of research on the different models before I chose this model.\nFirst, I knew it was not like your typical laptop. I've already got a Windows based desktop computer, and wanted something different. I chose this model because of the price, and had read really good reviews on it. I sometimes feel like I don't make the best buying decisions when it comes to electronics, but I have not once doubted myself for buying this Chromebook!\n\nThis little laptop is fast! As soon as you open it up, it automatically turns itself on and it only takes a few seconds to do so. It's also really quiet, thanks to the solid state drive that it has. The hard drive space isn't a lot, but when I purchased it I received 2 free years of 100 gb of Google Drive which is great because I can also access the same files from my Android phone, and my desktop computer, or anywhere else I might be. The battery life is surprisingly really good. I watch a lot of videos (Netflix and Hulu) on this machine, and a full battery lasts over 9 hours for me. The screen is also an HD screen, and the quality is good. Movies, and shows look great on it. The only thing I could see that could be a downside for some people would be the lack of a disc drive, however that could be remedied with an external disc drive.\n\nAll in all, I really like this computer!! I don't ever have to worry about security issues (viruses, malware) because it's safe, and it updates itself so I don't have to worry about that either. I use this computer many times a day, and use it more than my Windows 7 based desktop machine."}

She didn't want anything to do with computers, so my son suggested a Chromebook - genius! It's beautiful to look at and simple to use - more reliable than a Microsoft/PC setup that's always asking for attention and WAY more affordable than a Macbook.\n\nActually, this is all most people need for a computer. People break the bank for Macbooks that have capabilities they'll never use. If you're not looking to work in Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator, etc. Get this instead of a Mac! And if you're not into gaming, coding, Linux, dual booting, etc, Get this instead of a PC!\n\nLet's see, what else... The solid state drive is great - so you can use it on the move without worrying about the hard drive. Graphics capabilities are pretty good - especially considering the price. I just wish that it could run Skype. We were a little bummed when we realized that we couldn't Skype (this is why we bought it), so we all had to sign up for Google Hangouts so we can video call with my mother in law. Hangouts does work really well, but not everyone wants to have a Google account. But I also understand that the Chromebook isn't a regular computer (entirely different on the inside - it's got a brain more similar to an ATM than a PC - no lie!) But I also know that Google is smart and I guarantee you that they will create a Skype App soon.\n\nAll in all, we're really happy with it. And my mother in law LOVES it! She was able to use it right away - wasn't intimidated at all and she hasn't had a single problem with it yet. Great!"}

I plugged the USB camera that has the exact same specs from my desktop into the Chromebook and got a much better image.

Got the first one delivered, plugged it in, and attempted to get it set up.  The only problem is that the touchpad wouldn't work.  The little arrow cursor on the screen was unresponsive for the most part, and when it did move, it jumped all over the screen, making it impossible for you to get it where you wanted it to go.  So, I called the HP customer service number, only to get disconnected twice before finally getting someone.  After spending 1 hour on the phone, there was nothing they could do to help.  It would have taken a few weeks for me to get a replacement through HP, so I decided to check with Amazon to see if they could help me with an exchange faster.\nAmazon was wonderful to work with in the customer service department.  The return process was quick and painless, and they even had another Chromebook overnighted to us, and waived the shipping fee!\nWe were excited to get the 2nd Chromebook, but when we plugged it in, it had the exact same problem as the first!  The touchpad wouldn't work!!!!  The little arrow just darted all over the screen, and sometimes it wouldn't move at all.  What a pain!  So, back to Amazon it is going.

Manipulating Amazon's rating system is a common practice that is often left undetected. For instances companies would send products to Vine Voice reviewers to initiate hype+interest to drive sales. Amazon combats this by deleting blatant bias and manipulated reviews but they does not police or stop the undetectable, 3rdParty often based in the Far East (ex: India) with multiple amazon accounts manipulating the \"helpful votes\" system. \"helpful votes\" is important to Vine reviewers, as with enough \"Unhelpful votes\", they will lose status + extra perks from (such as getting to play with products before its release to market) thus Vine reviewers + \"manipulated helpful votes\" cannot be trusted on mainstream products with high volume customer traffic.\n@\n=This review is NOT for you if...=\nIf you're among those who already aware what they're getting themselves into.\n=Chromebook is for you if...=@\nBUT IF ALL YOU HAVE IS $200>CHROMEBOOK NONTOUCH IS STILL BEST VALUE FOR YOUR DOLLAR.  If the customer's needs revolves around BINGE STREAMING SHOWS/MOVIES , ADDICTED TO FACEBOOK, and could careless having their virtual data stolen by Google Inc, then Chromebooks are the cheap drug of choice for you.\n\n==History==\nFirst of all, it's easy to judge my POV as being disingenuous. Vast majority of mainstream casual Internet crowd will no doubt view me this way but before writing me off, honest enough to admit, I'm just like you! Originally a googler user on a Netscape browsers since 1996! Google continues to push innovation year after year, Chromebooks are no exception. One of the goals they had with Chromebook was connecting the lower class to the Web.\nTo make it a reality, they've engineered a Browser like Operating System OS, a software requiring low resources making it affordable. In the past getting online means buying $600laptop but mid 2011 google changed that with ChomeOS inside a Chromebook at $199!\nBut wait, just 4 years prior Chromebook, the industry, lead by Asus EeePC created a new category called \"netbooks\" laptops in 2007. Cheap? Yes! But failure experiment due to slow performance, a deal breaker! WHY? because the technology wasn't there yet. Thus, we the consumer market correlated the terms NETBOOKS CHEAP Laptops = unusable SLOW.  Until Chromebooks  changed all not even 3 years ago.  Finally a cheap but fast machine at a fraction of a price are now at the hands of the budget conscious buyers. Is it a full working laptop? Definitely not. But it's perfectly fine for people needing to browse the internets... at least for now.\n@\nThen another \"cause and effect\" shift in innovation occurred in the industry. \"Cause\" > MOBILE devices boom, \"EFFECT\" > Faster Tech evolution.\nINTEL & AMD's new SoC and APU chips. To the novice readers, those two companies are the brain power of the industry. AND the latest shift in innovation occurred late (October) 2013, higher level of processing power paved way to newly reengineered \"Netbooks\"* to match Chromebooks affordability but offering users usability a full functionality of Windows OS and not just a Browser backboned OS(ChromeOS). The Technology finally caught up.\n11-14\" Touch Laptops w/ advanced SoC/APU based notebooks from various OEM are bringing back \"NETBOOK\" category to life. These was what Asus EeePC shoud have been back in 2008. But unfortunately, our frustrating experience of NETBOOKS in years past is hard to forget, the damage has already been done.

These dastardly companies silently updated the previously benign software to include code that bombarded users with spam ads.\n\nThe two extensions involved, 'Add to Feedly' and 'Tweet This Page,' each had less than 100,000 users, but these users started to experience unwanted ads and complain about this upon support forums, according to the Wall Street Journal. Both extensions included code which was unacceptable to Google's terms as it would serve up undesirable (rival) ads, which resulted in users giving one-star ratings and calling the extensions spam sources.\n\nThe Chrome Web Store\n\nBite the hand that Feedly\n\nThe developer of 'Add to Feedly', Amit Agarwal, admitted that he sold his extension to an unknown buyer whose name returned no results on Google. \"It was a 4-figure offer for something that had taken an hour to create and I agreed to the deal. I had no clue about the buyer and was also curious to know - why would anyone pay this kind of money for such a simple Chrome extension,\" explained Agarwal in a blog post.\n\nThe business model of the buyer was simple, explains Agarwal, \"They buy popular add-ons, inject affiliate links and the bulk of users would never notice this since the Chrome browser automatically updates add-ons in the background. And there are no change-logs either.\"\n\nIsolated incident?\n\nThe issue doesn't seem like it is just limited to the two add-ons mentioned above. Further investigation suggests that advertisers regularly buy popular extensions and transform them into adware. More and more developers are being approached about selling their add-ons. The creators of the popular Chrome extension Honey, for example, said they were also approached by malware companies in the past and learned that a six figure sum could be made in profits every month should they join the dark side...\nend.\n==Watch the video link below and prepare to blow you mind.==\nBing search: \"/watch?v=b0w36GAyZIA \"\nIf they have powerful enough data analytics, the NSA can't be anything LESS than GODs among men.\n\nRANT OVER :)"}

Just as an NYC apartment might be located directly over a popular bar, or across from a parking garage, or next to crazy neighbors, or not have heat etc. -- HP laptops are *always* undone by some seemingly arbitrary design error that makes you not like them.  (By comparison, the faults of Apple systems, annoying as they are, are usually interpretable from some marketing perspective.)\n\nThe HP chromebook 14 goes one better, sporting TWO fatal flaws.  The first is the CPU fan.  It's always on, and emits a maddening high-pitched whine through the bottom speaker grills, which I guess also function as heat vents.  Users whose hearing isn't sensitive to higher registers will find themselves untroubled.  The rest will live in a constant state of irritable tension as they chrome-browse the net.  This could have been so easily fixed early on in prototyping, but no, nobody at HP thought it worth the effort.\n\nThe second fault is the screen.  Yes, it's 14 inches, awesome.  But it must be the cheapest, crappiest, darkest, most reflective, least visual-angle-y display on the market.\n\nMany will say: yes, true, the screen blows and the fan screeches.  But hey, it's $300, what do you expect?  Well, I'm impressed by that argument as far as the screen goes (maybe...).

Plus, I already used some key Google services (Chrome, Gmail and Calendar) so I thought it might be worth a shot to see how they operated on Chrome OS since in my experience software generally runs best on its native OS if created by the same developer (i.e. iTunes on Mac OS X and Microsoft Office on Windows).

A few times I said this OS sucked but after researching it I was able to figure out how to accomplish my task at hand by reading directions, imagine that!\n\nMedia Files: On day one I tested it by watching numerous mp4 files I had stored on an SD card. I popped the card in (which does not stick out from the side of the machine) and the file browser popped up. I double clicked the m4v file and the media player that is built into the OS started playing the file. I also tried some music files I had stored on a USB drive and it worked the same way with the file browser opening up and the built in player launching upon double clicking the file. I have my music collection encoding using iTunes so they are AAC m4a files, which confirms Googles claims that these file types are supported. iTunes users should feel comfortable migrating to this environment. See this page for other supported media types: [...]\n\nMicrosoft Office: It appears that Google is trying to cover all their bases with \"basic\" tasks by including Google Docs, Spreadsheets and Slides as Microsoft Office alternatives and with a little time learning the interfaces you should be able to do all the basic functions in these apps. There is also an offline option to work on your files without an internet connection which worked fine but I quickly found out that documents can be edited but spreadsheets are view only when offline. This is something that Google needs to work on ASAP because if I didn't have a mobile hotspot this alone would be reason enough for me to return/sell it. So, if you don't always have an internet connection and use spreadsheets a lot then this device and OS is not for you. I also installed SkyDrive which allowed me to edit Microsoft files in their web-apps, which look like the paid software versions but within a web browser. They too have limited functionality like the Google apps but you would be able to find things quicker if you are used to those user interfaces but you do lose the offline editing capabilities that Google provides you through their alternatives (though they aren't perfect as I already mentioned). Google Keep is also offered and it is like Notes in Mac OS X or Notepad in Windows so you do have something for quick note taking and this works perfectly offline. I don't use slide presentations so I cant comment on that program.\n\nApps: I feel a lot of these are unnecessary because most of the ones I've installed simply direct you straight to the homepage of that website just as if you clicked one of your bookmarks in your Bookmarks Bar. One advantage I see to this though as I used it more is that you can pin more of these apps to your Launcher Bar at the bottom of the screen than you could install on the Bookmarks Bar in your Chrome browser window. The apps also allow you to open them in a separate window which is nice if you don't want it to open in another browser tab and/or cluttering up the Chrome browser. Also, hardly any of them are redesigned in any way like you are used to seeing apps on smart phones. The ones that were built differently I felt just didn't work as well as the full site so I just ended up typing the internet address in the Chrome browser and removed the app. One thing that I liked that are present in Google apps on other OSs that I saw was missing here was the speech input. On iPad I like speaking things I want to search for and that wasn't an option in the Google Chrome or Google Search apps on this machine. I do see a microphone above the screen so I know its capable of hearing my voice, so hopefully this is something they add soon.\n\nHardware: The build quality of this machine is one of the best I've seen at this price point! I find it visually appealing with the selection of colors they used (my model was silver/white) and the keyboard tray reminds me of a Mac wireless keyboard. This color combination also makes it impossible to see fingerprints. The soft touch material being used for the outer body of this laptop feels nice to the hands. It can take a beating too apparently because I already bumped it against something pretty hard by accident and it didn't show a mark at all! Nice job HP! This device is also very thin and is competing with ultrabooks in terms of size, in fact it looks almost identical to the sleekbook/ultrabook offerings from HP. The device also has a nice selection of ports providing USB 2.0, USB 3.0, full size HDMI, SD card reader, headphone/microphone combo jack, Kensington lock slot and an indicator light for sleep/use.\n\nScreen: I did notice while watching videos that I had to adjust the screen angle a couple of times to get the perfect viewing angle (mostly for dark blacks). Clearly this is not an IPS display, but for $300 I guess you can't expect to get a 1080p IPS display. It feels very solid and doesnt flex very much when I tried to bend the screen from side-to-side. The screen is also very thin and after applying pressure to the back of the panel to see if it would show through I glad to say nothing showed unless you were applying A LOT of pressure, which Im sure most users wont. I was a little disappointed to see that the backlit chrome bar present on the lid of HP 11 and Pixel was missing here. I think adding this would make a nice additional design element.\n\nKeyboard: It doesn't have much key travel but if you can train yourself to type softer then you should be able to adjust and make it a good typing experience (with devices becoming thinner this is just something we will have to make adjustments for). Also, the keyboard tray is solid and does not flex or trampoline at all. Some back-lit keys would be a nice addition in future models since ambient lighting isn't the greatest in most rooms Ive used this in but the grey lettering on white keys helps to combat that a little bit. I love most of the shortcuts at the top of the keyboard such as the full screen, volume adjustments and display brightness keys but the back/forward aren't necessary with trackpad gestures and anyone used to using alt+tab to switch through apps won't use the app switching key. I feel one, if not all, of these could be removed and shift the row left so we can have a dedicated DELETE key (holding alt+backspace isn't quite as intuitive for people coming from Windows). See this site for keyboard shortcuts: [...]\n\nTrackpad: I was shocked at how the trackpad had a silky smooth texture to it which reminded me of a Macbook because my finger rarely skips across the surface. I love the addition of trackpad gestures and use tap-to-click, back/forward and scrolling all the time. The clickpad is only clickable on the bottom half of the trackpad and gets easier to push down the closer to the bottom of the trackpad you get. A full clickpad might be a nice change in future models.\n\nHinge: The hinge to open the lid isn't as stiff as you find on 90% of laptops today which require two hands to pry open, however you still can't open it with one hand. Hopefully with more use the hinge will loosen a little more since one unit I tested in a store before I made the purchase seemed to be a little looser than the one on my unit. I personally love laptops that you don't have to pry open with two hands and this is about halfway there. I think if they put the hinge from the HP Chromebook 11 on this then they would have nailed it. I also decided to grab the laptop by the lid and shook it around to test how strong the hinge was and it didn't give very much at all so Im confident that its a solid build and won't break anytime soon if ever.\n\nAccessories: I like that the power adapter is smaller than we are used to seeing with traditional laptops but at the same time I feel power bricks have become outdated and need to be more like tablet chargers having folding prongs built in to a cube shaped adapter versus having a cord going in and coming out of a power brick.\n\nPerformance: So far from my testing the performance has been great. I wouldnt think that using an Intel Celeron laptop would be something that I would brag about but I haven't had any issues with things getting hung up or freezing. Im not even sure why Google made the Pixel with an i5 processor because after using this I really don't feel like its necessary (unless its for gaming which is something I don't do on laptops). Web pages load pretty fast on my home network which is running on an ac router and I don't experience any lag as I scroll down from loading images. Refreshing the laptop internals to have wireless ac built-in would be a nice addition in future models.\n\nBattery: Installed is a 4 cell battery and checking the HP website results in a 9.5 hour claim. After using it for a week and monitoring usage very closely here is what I found. I was able to get 4 days of use out of it before having to plug it in and combined use time was 7 hours. However, 1.75 hours of this was watching videos so battery life could have been better if just used for web browsing and document editing only. In fact, looking at my results and doing some simple math, Im confident 9.5 hours is an accurate claim. For once HP isn't exaggerating battery life claims! The Intel Celeron processor doesnt appear to be built for extended video playback though because after watching 1.75 hours of files from a USB drive I lost 30%! So, doing the math this machine should be able to last close to 6 hours for viewing back-to-back movies if you are on a long car ride or flight. Not that impressive when compared to tablets but having files stored internally might produce better results. All these findings were obtained with active wi-fi and brightness set to 50% the whole time. Using the sleep feature by closing the lid or using the shut down feature in the bottom right of the screen or holding the power button seemed to produce the same drainage result. I found that after a combined sleep time of 75 hours I only lost 5% of battery life. Id say thats pretty impressive compared to Windows machines and leaves more battery for use! Charging time from 5% took exactly 2 hours to fully charge back to 100% which is great since my cell phone charges about that quick and I consider that to be the industry standard.\n\nConclusion: Overall I am pleased with the device but $300 might still be a little high for something that only serves as an internet browsing machine since the spreadsheet editing isn't where Id like it to be for offline use. I will probably let this device go for sale on eBay though because I don't need a third internet browsing device in my house. It simply doesnt outperform my iPad because the iWorks suite has more offline functionality on-the-go and the battery life of this machine comes up a little short. For fully functional software I will continue to rely on my home PC. HP should allow add-ons or upgrades on their website for a backlit keyboard, wireless ac, IPS display and a tablet adapter (if they can develop one). As for Chrome OS, add the option of editing spreadsheets offline and Ill give your OS another shot."}

Its program is not compatible with Windows which is what most people have. She also couldn't store her itunes music on her laptop.  Itunes is also not compatible with this computer.  So we had to return it. This laptop was not for us!\n\nHOWEVER! Let me tell you how AWESOME Amazon was at handling my refund & return. The customer service person was understanding and helpful. She refunded the money right away and then emailed me a return slip.  I took the package to UPS and they returned it for FREE!

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "I have the 11-inch Samsung Chromebook 3, which I love -- and have come to adapt to working almost entirely within ChromeOS and Google apps.  But I had been frustrated from time to time by the underpowered Samsung: often not enough power to play videos cleanly, and certainly not to Chromecast them; and even Google Docs were too much of a stretch for the old Chromebook -- typing was often frustratingly laggy.\n\nThis new Chromebook is a huge improvement.  The larger screen is very nice -- I really don't share the criticisms I've seen in other reviews about its lack of clarity.  Videos play cleanly (and are crisp in HD); Google docs and other apps are extremely responsive.  The transition from the Samsung to the HP is like the transition from a netbook to a Macbook.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "My netbook was on its last legs, so I was in the market for an inexpensive laptop.  I was definitely nervous about buying a Chromebook-- I was worried about not being able to install programs like iTunes, Photoshop, or Microsoft Office.\n\nAfter a lot of research, I settled on the HP Chromebook 14. Big caveat here that I went to a brick-and-mortar store to buy the version with 4 GB memory.  The version I bought also came with 24 months of free T-mobile internet (only 200 mb per month free).\n\nI have not been disappointed.  This thing is very fast and plays HD video great. The battery life is also superb... I don't even worry about plugging it in most of the time 'cause I think the battery easily lasts for six hours, maybe longer, doing basic web surfing.  I have had no problems with Netflix, Pandora, or watching ESPN, etc.  The free T-mobile internet wasn't much (200 mb per month) but was a nice inclusion, as it didn't require a credit card or contract or any personal info to activate, and I can now surf the web at the airport, coffee shop, etc. if the wi-fi isn't free.  You'll burn through it in no time if you try to watch video, but it's nice for checking your email or light web surfing on the go.  Also, you can purchase additional data from T-Mobile once you use up the monthly allotment.\n\nI wouldn't buy this if you absolutely need iTunes or Microsoft Office... I've been doing all right with Google Music and Google Docs.  You get a ton of free Google Drive storage space to stash all your documents.  It's also got a card slot if you really feel the need to carry a ton of files around with you.  I bought a 64 GB card but I haven't really been using it for anything, to be honest.\n\nMy only complaint so far: When this Chromebook is plugged into several of the power outlets at my girlfriend's apartment, the touchpad stops working.  It'll work fine again once it's unplugged.  This has only happened so far at this one apartment.  If you search online, you'll see that some other people have been having similar issues.\n\nThat being said, I love this Chromebook."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "As of a couple days ago we've started having major issues. The HP screen will go blank after about 15-30 minutes of use. When I reboot it will tell me there is an OS error or it is missing. I've re-installed the OS system using the Chrome recovery tool 3 times now. The problem still persist. I'm suspecting a hardware issue??? Can there be an OS update that's causing a conflict with the HP??? I don't know since all that stuff is done behind the scene. I think a Chromebook should last longer than a couple years of use.\n\nHas anyone else had similar experiences?\n\nThis is our 3rd Chrome OS device. Last year we purchased 2 Samsung Chrome OS devices for our daughters. I was drawn in by the concept of an OS that you didn't have to update or worry about virus software and making sure everything was up to date. We also have a mac and a HP laptop running windows 7. So I'm well familiar with the different operating systems and there strengths and weaknesses. I particularly have issues with windows OS. My wife and daughter were always calling me at work with problems or programs asking for permission to update. I'm not an IT wizzard and know enough to be dangerous...lol Anyway I found it frustrating for all of us. I can say thanks to the Chrome OS ALL of those issues have gone away! No calls on having problems booting up, no phone calls on programs asking permission to update. No phone calls on system warnings about viruses and other stuff.\n\nI think a good way to approach the Chrome OS is looking at it as a tool. Windows OS is a tool that I use at work. I have applications that I need to do my job. My mac is another tool that I use for recording music in my basement studio and it works great for that.  Chrome OS is a tool for doing pretty much everything you'd do online. Email, banking, social media, Netflixs, Google also has been busy with the help of developers in creating offline apps if you need to do simple photos edits or listen to MP3's type a document. This is where my wife and kids do 100% of their stuff so Chrome is perfect for them. Chrome is perfect for me typing this review in Amazon and I use it exclusively for everything I do outside of my music stuff.\n\nOkay enough about Chrome OS and onto the Chromebook 14. Moving to a 14\" screen is nice compared to the Samsung 11.6\" screen. I found the screen to be clear and easy to view. In Chrome style it boots super fast, under 10 seconds and unlike windows even after a years usage it's still just as fast. Compared to my other daughters laptop that takes close to 2 minutes now to boot. My mac has a SSD and boots in about 20 seconds consistently. I love the Chromebooks size. It's small and lightweight at 4 pounds compared to the other windows HP laptop we own. The battery life is really good again compared to the HP laptop running windows. I'd say it's easily double the battery life. It's been an enjoyable experience so far.\n\nThere are a couple things to be aware of before you invest in a the Chrome operating system. Be aware that you can not connect directly to a printer via a usb cable. This isn't an issue for us because we have a wifi printer connected to our home network and can access the printer via google cloud printing. Works great and I haven't had any issues with this setup. The other issue may be input devices. I personally like using a track ball instead of the touch pad. So this is a drawback currently to Chrome OS. I'm hoping as the Chrome OS gains margins that MFG's will start supporting the OS with some of these input devices. It's not a deal breaker for me just a minor inconvenience. Other then that I've been very please to date with the Chromebook 14.\n\nIf any major issues come up I'll update my review. To date I've been please with this product. Fast and easy to use, no updates just boot it up and go. Can't ask for anything better then that. Oh, and you'll never see the blue screen of death like in other operating systems... :)"}

I've found that I cat get 10-12 hours of battery life by using this strictly in \"Dock\" mode. I connect an external (and larger, better looking) display, then close the lid on the Chromebook. The result is that the Chromebook itself uses a lot less battery power to simply send the signal to the external display than it would if it ALSO had to power the backlight for its internal display.\n\nThe result is a machine that gives me all-day power for $300. Really, really worth the cash since I'm a web developer and all I really need is a browser and an SSH connection to my dev machine (available via a Chrome extension, w/SSH key support)."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "Second negative comment on this product:  It DOES NOT SUPPORT DIRECT PRINTING!!!!  How on earth could somebody create a laptop like computer that CANNOT PRINT!!!  To be fair, when I bought this machine, I had no intention of printing from it.  Rather when I need to do those kind of tasks, I do those on a Windows based PC.  But I had recommended this laptop to somebody, NOT REALIZING that they would need to print from it.  I had lauded only the features I had needed, and didn't even investigate something that ANYBODY in their right mind, would design into a laptop-like computer!  I just assumed it was there.  It's not.  Now Google has a \"work-a-round\" in that you can do \"cloud printing\".  That's assuming that you can make THAT work, because the person who is having this problem with their HP Chromebook is NOT able to get it to work, and so far NONE of the suggestions they have found offer a solution.  The ONLY way I have found to print from a HP Chromebook is to print to a PDF file.  At least they build that ability in.  Then I email the PDF file to a Windows based computer, and then print it.  I tested that, and it worked beautifully.  Considering that the HP Chromebook has an abundance of USB ports on it, surely they could supply at least a basic driver that would work with (hey, you specify which printers).\n\nOriginal review follows this additional update:\nI tried pairing the HP Chrome-book using it's blue tooth technology with a Bose blue tooth speaker.  First, I tested the Bose speaker using my iPod with a blue tooth transmitter on it.  The sound quality was quite good. The disappointment came when I tried using the blue tooth from the HP Chrome book. The music stored on the Chrome book plays, but at the beginning of each song, there is stuttering, and after a few seconds, it's like the systems finally catch up, and then mostly, it plays okay, but there are hiccups every so often. When I tried the Hangout function, placing a visual/audio call over the internet, the picture is about 1 to 3 seconds before the voice, which is very disconcerting. Yet, when I turn off the blue tooth on the Chrome book, the sound reverts back to the computers speakers, and then there is absolutely no delay. Conclusion for me is that the HP Chrome book has an issue with blue tooth, and it's simply not useable for conversations, and disappointing with music. Distance between the devices made no noticeable difference. It sounded about the same whether it was 3' or 15'. Because the Blue tooth does NOT work PROPERLY with the HP Chrome Book, I had to reduce my star rating from 5 to 4.  It's not a game changer, but it is disappointing that HP apparently did not test this feature properly.  I know my Blue Tooth speaker system is good, because it plays perfectly with an iPod using Blue tooth.  (ADDENDUM:  The Chrome Book and the Bose speaker work PERFECTLY WITH A CABLE.  HP might as not have bothered putting Blue Tooth on this Chrome Book.  It is flawed.)\n\nOriginal Review:\nI ended up not ordering this from Amazon because Amazon did not directly stock it, and therefore I was worried at the terms and conditions of some of the third party vendors selling through Amazon, which give the distinct impression that if you don't buy the second year of support, that they are not responsible from the moment they ship it, if it gets damaged.  Therefore I bought it from a vendor I like and trust to cover a product if it gets damaged in shipment.\n\nThat said, this is the best laptop (like) computer I have ever purchased, and I will NEVER, EVER buy a Windows based laptop again.  Period.  Now I can \"get away\" with this decision because I only use a laptop for web access and email, and nothing more.  I don't have the need for Windows compliant software.  Obviously, your needs may be different.\n\nBest thing I've experienced with this Chrome-book is the absolute SPEED!  I lift the lid, and the system is READY to go in 2 seconds, or less!  I do NOT have to worry and wait while that clunker Windows operating system takes up to 2-3 minutes to load.  I do NOT have to wait for Anti-virus software to verify it's up to date, and if it's not, wait possibly 10-15 minutes for it to update.  I so NOT have to wait to see Windows patches lining up for about 20 to 40 MINUTES of downloading, installing, re-booting.  All that stuff made me loath even turning on a Windows based laptop (and the one I WAS using had a fast hard drive in it, and had 4 GB of memory in it, along with the second fastest Intel CPU.\n\nAll the applications on the Chrome-book run flawlessly.  No problems and the \"learning curve\" is very quick.\n\nI very highly recommend this device!!!!\n\n(a couple of minor points - (1) the USB 3 slots are quite stiff - you may have to push harder than you feel comfortable to get say, a memory stick, in there.  That said, I had no problem inserting a 32Gb mini-stick in there with all my music on it.  The file manager came up immediately, and I was able to use the folders I set up originally in Windows to get to my music.  Once you start playing a song in the folder, the system automatically continues playing other songs in the same folder.  (2) I like using a mouse, but I can see that using the touch pad is definitely smoother, and faster.  I'll probably use both for a while, and see how that shakes out.  The speed of the touch pad is far quicker than the mouse.  (3) Gmail is just like on a Windows based machine.  It works pretty well, once you get it set up the way you like it.  My only reservation was that on my Windows based system, I was using Microsoft Outlook, which can be set up to run with several email boxes (accounts), and automatically downloads all the boxes on a regular basis.  With Gmail,. you can only have one email account.  (4) The screen size - I went with the 14\" because I had experienced the Samsung Chrome book which is 11\" and I didn't like the small screen because my vision isn't that good.  However, even with 14\" screen, I was straining to read web pages.  The solution is to set the display at 125% and that boosts the print of most web pages to be read easily.)"}

By far my best computer purchase: I just feel so free with the Chrome operating system - it's speedy, light, and totally cloud-based (though there's 16 GB available to store things locally). I really like how integrated it is with Google Drive. When I want to save something, I can easily choose to save it into Drive, picking the folder, etc. without having access to Drive take up a ton of local hard disk space, which happens when I set my PC and Mac up to have direct Drive access.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "Do not buy this model; get the one with 4 Gb RAM and 4G capability for only $50 more. Although Chrome OS runs very efficiently and fast, having 4 Gb of RAM is definitely worth the additional $50 investment, which also includes 2 years of T-Mobile 4G service.\n\nI often have more than 20 tabs open on the Chrome browser, so the additional memory contributes to the overall smooth and fluid experience in using Chrome OS. As there is no memory expansion slot, You CANNOT add more RAM to the HP Chromebook, whether you buy the 2 Gb or the 4 Gb version. The RAM is soldered onto the circuit board.\n\nThe suggested retail price of this enhanced model (HP 14-q070nr 14-Inch Chromebook (T-Mobile)) is $349, although many sellers may ask you to pay more than that. If you are not in a hurry, you can choose the one sold directly by Amazon and save money.\n\nI can guarantee that once you get used to using Chrome OS, you will not go back to Windows, or even Apple OS X!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "Although I bought My chromebook 14 in the UK, it is not available on amazon UK yet, I had to buy it direct from HP. Like the T-mobile version here, mine comes with a built in HSPA+ radio that gives me superfast mobile internet in the area of London where I live, on par with wifi speeds pretty much. This is the first product I reviewed that got a 5-star rating although perhaps 4.75 stars would have been more accurate. The tiny flaws that it does have are balanced out by the stupendously low price, basically this is a machine you can easily compare to a macbook or a windows ultrabook that costs 4 times as much an it will still hold its own. Obviously this is a Chrome OS device so one has to do their research if they can live with a cloud-based OS and there is a very small learning curve when switching, but honestly Chrome OS is so easy to learn, almost anyone should be able to do it. I also wrote a detailed and critical review looking at every little aspect of the device, meant for chromies who are already sold on the concept but need comparisons with other chromebooks available on the market. For my money, this particular model is the best chromebook you can get out there, factoring in things like price, battery life, 4g connectivity and screen size. Without further ado here are my initial impressions:\n\nInitial Impressions about the HP chromebook 14 UK 3G version and comparison to the Samsung series 3\n\nFeel and Quality\n\nThis is definitely a laptop, it feels very different from the samsung, the weight is substantial, it is much bigger and the fan is constantly on and very much audible. I suppose I will just have to get used to the noise, but that is definitely a step back from the Samsung. Some reviewers noted they can only hear the fan when they put their ears next to the keyboard, definitely not the case with me, I hear it all the time when Im in a quiet room. When I take it to the kitchen, where there is a lot of ambient noise from the fridge, it gets cancelled out and I cant hear a thing. Most people probably won't even notice the fan unless they use it at night in their bedrooms.\nKeyboard\nThe keyboard has a different feel to it than the samsung, it has textured keys and they keys have slightly more travel. Annoyingly, the keyboard is narrower than on the samsung despite the bigger size of the machine itself, so you get narrower enter, backspace and shift keys. The keyboard otherwise feels good and it is quite silent to type on, but not as much as on the samsung, perhaps that will change with time. The keys are not as rounded as on the samsung and I must say I prefer the typing experience on the samsung so far, but maybe Ill get used to it in a few days. There is more key travel on the HP, that is definitely in its favour.\nTrackpad\nThe trackpad is the same width but slightly taller. I feel no difference in practical use, however the HP has a slightly loose trackpad that rattles every time I tap to click, which is annoying, so I find myself preferring to actually click the trackpad. Thankfully the trackpad requires less pressure to click than on the samsung and the noise is more satisfying. The loose trackpad feels cheap, Im not sure if this is an issue with my machine in particular or if it is more widespread.\nScreen\nThe 14 screen makes a huge difference in comparison to the Samsung, I don't have to put on my glasses and I don't have to zoom in or squint to see text properly. The bigger screen is the main reason I bought this machine and overall Im satisfied. I did not find the lower PPI to be an issue, you tend to sit a bit further away anyways. The lack of an anti-glare coating is preferable in my case, text appears to be clearer and more crisp. The screen does reflect when switched off, I see no reflections when it is switched on, I keep it at about 80 percent brightness. Reflections from the blazing sun is not an issue we have to grapple with here in the UK. Maximum brightness appears to be about 10 percent higher than on the samsung, it is definitely noticeable and a welcome change. On the other hand contrast ratios are worse and colours are more washed out than on the samsung. Next to each other, the same background photo shows truer colours on the samsung, the setting sun is more orangey. The HP seems to struggle with contrast, for instance a light skinned person on a white background looks quite bad. Also, I find that I need to tilt the screen quite a bit back to get decent contrast ratios when writing and reading text on a white background, then when I watch videos I have to tilt the screen a bit forward to get better colour reproduction. It seems that constantly adjusting the screen is just something that comes with TN panels. But like I said, overall this is a pretty good screen for the price.\nMaterials and Build quality\nThis is where the HP truly shines compared to the samsung. This is a beautiful machine, well made, sturdy, quality materials, and the heft seems to add to the quality feel. The plastics used are much thicker than on the samsung, there is no creak when you pick it up. Mine is the snow white colour which is just amazingly gorgeous, Im truly in love with the look and feel of this. This all comes at a price though, the bottom half of the machine is twice as thick as the samsung, the height difference is noticeable when you are typing on the table. As for weight, this is no macbook air, I definitely won't be carrying this around as much. I plan to keep this for home use and take the samsung with me when Im out and about.\n\nPerformance\nI did not get the opportunity to test this extensively, so these are just initial impressions. My Samsung has increased scrolling performance markedly on the beta channel and when I go to google plus or the notoriously heavy Verge I see no difference between the two machines in normal scrolling. The HP seems to drop frames just as much as the samsung. Where I see a real difference is in loading times, pages load in about half the time on the HP and the waiting time to be able to scroll without jerkiness or checkerboarding is also about half of what you get on the samsung. Same goes for switching between tabs. Where the HP 14 really leaves the samsung in the dust is watching HD videos, there is just no comparison. The Samsung can just about handle HD streaming in netflix, but when it comes to youtube or other flash-based streaming sites, it struggles to play videos smoothly, there are missed frames, jumping and jerkiness. Also, I found that with the samsung switching between resolutions or going full window and back is problematic and really taxes the cpu. No such problems here, the HP plays everything beautifully, HD videos are crisp and fluid, they look beautiful on the large, glossy screen. Perhaps the only drawback of the glossy screen is when you watch dark scenes, you can see your own reflection a bit, but not a huge issue overall. The speakers are loud and clear, they are noticeably more powerful than the one on the samsung. Of course there is zero base, but they are still fine speakers for a laptop. Overall, if you like to watch videos and movies on your chromebook, the HP leaves the samsung in the dust, image quality, fluidity, responsiveness and speaker sound are all superior, but that is to be expected from a bigger machine.\n\nConnectivity\nWifi performance is fine, same as the samsung, picks up signals easily. This model comes with mobile internet included. In the UK, as in the US it is an HSPA+ wireless radio. In the US this is marketed as 4G, in the UK this is considered 3G or 3.5G according to some marketing materials. It is faster than normal 3G, but it won't be up to LTE speeds. The network provider is Fogg Mobile, a Swedish telecom company who have effectively outsourced the service to Three. I already have a mobile phone contract with Three and mobile internet speeds in my area are relatively fast (Wapping in East London), actually they are usually better than what I get from my BT wired broadband over wifi. Fogg mobile gives you 250 MB data per month free for 2 years, which is only enough to use in an emergency when nothing else is available. I will generally stick to wifi and tethering, but it is a good option to have and the sim is swappable, so you can easily get an unlimited mobile data SIM card from Three for around 15 per month which should give you constant internet coverage without having to use wifi or tethering. The only problem I have with Three is that they don't always have their own masts, so when you head to central london you have to make do with the very low bandwidth that they manage to rent from other providers and at peak times that is nonexistent in places like the city. Still, you can insert a sim from any provider if they have better service in your area.\nI tested HSPA+ vs BT broadband speed in Wapping at 5.30 PM with no one else connected to the wifi network. Streaming speeds were 6537 kbps on threes mobile network, almost twice of what is minimally recommended for HD video streaming. ON BT wifi I got 9837 kbps, which is around 50 percent higher but in real world use both connection speeds are fine.\n\nBattery Life\nI had no chance to test this yet, at the moment I am at 90 percent charge and the machine estimates 7.5 hours of charge left, which seems to fall in line with what most people get. Id say 8 hours is a reasonable expectation from this machine, but this will go down steeply if you stream HD videos. As for heat, the bottom of the machine is completely cool to the touch and it seems you don't get the annoying spinning up of the fans that you get from windows laptops and macbooks when you tax the CPU. The Haswell microarchitecture really shines here.\n\nConclusion\nOverall I am happy with my purchase, the HP Chromebook 14 is a significant step up from the Samsung series 3. What you gain in screen size, performance, quality and looks you lose in portability and weight, so you have to examine your usage scenarios to see if this is the right machine for you. My feeling is that for the time being this is the Macbook Pro of budget chromebooks. It is heavier and more expensive than the Acer C720 or or the Samsung, but it will serve you better as a desktop replacement and it is more suitable as a workspace. Built in mobile internet is also a huge plus in my eyes as unlimited data plans are becoming more common in the UK, so you could conceivably use this machine without ever needing to connect to wifi, therefore saving yourself a bunch on a wired broadband subscription. I think that the HP14 offers real value for money, particularly in the UK where laptops are significantly more expensive than in the US even if you factor in the 20% VAT. To give you an idea about the value proposition, the 3G model costs 279 whilst the Wifi only model is priced at 250 at the online UK HP store. To find a windows laptop that has comparable specs and build quality, you would have to pay at least twice as much, with apple you will have to pay 3-4 times as much. When it comes to chromebooks, the ACER C720 and the Samsung both cost 180 at PC World if you factor in the 20 cashback offer, but both have only 2 GB of ram. For the added quality and screen size, I think 70 is a reasonable price to pay if portability and weight isn't paramount. It is also worth keeping an eye on special voucher codes, I managed to buy this model at a 10 percent discount, so I paid only 251 for it, there might be similar offers in the future."}

If it didn't work out, well, it didn't cost much and I don't mind having a spare machine.\n\nWell, it is just a bit better than the other machine.  The screen's the same resolution but a bit brighter and crisper and a bit less limited in its viewing angles.  The battery life is distinctly better.  The fan noise is still there (this is not a silent machine) but a bit quieter.  Keyboard etc. are comparable.  The one thing that's *very* different is the amazing speed with which it comes up.  Open the lid and boom, everything's there.  It's a startling contrast to any Windows/Linux/Mac laptop I've ever used.  Basically the only time I've turned on the other computer since the Chromebook arrived was to get some data off it.  The cheaper machine is winning, hands down.  That's about one third the price of what it effectively replaces, and that in turn was 30% cheaper than direct alternatives.\n\nThe only downsides have to do with ChromeOS.  It works for what it does, and extra apps help, but there are gaps.  As a developer who works from home, the lack of a decent ssh client is a bit of a problem.  The absolutely laughable state of the VPN support - as far as I know nobody has ever gotten it working with any VPN server that wasn't specially configured to accommodate it - is likely to affect more than just developers.  Almost everyone else I know has flipped their Chromebook into developer mode and installed some other operating system, but I'm sticking with it because I have other machines I use for work.  If anybody's planning to use ChromeOS as a *primary* desktop environment, I'd recommend against it.  As a browsing/email machine it's awesome, but don't expect it to excel at much else."}

I'm a coder/application developer in a graduate research program so I have a linux server that I work off of most of the weekdays either from the office or via secure shell (in the chrome store) and I can remote desktop to my old windows and mac machines. I love the chrome app, it's just like terminal but doesn't have all the glitz-y add-ons that macs can get - so much better than powershell, sorry windoze. I was a bit skeptical of the Chromebook, but I have to say - I'm really impressed and I really love having everything (personal) in the cloud. I obviously work from multiple machines frequently and it was always messy to keep track of where which file went depending on which server I was working at or which home machine I grabbed because my husband was using the other one. Now I just throw everything in my 100 GB Google drive and I can access it from anywhere plus it's automatically at my fingertips when I open up my Chromebook. Do I miss word and other proprietary software? A little, but really are the freeware versions all that bad? Or are we absurdly loyal to brand names that continue to fail us?

The new HP Chromebook line comes in pastel colors that they seemed perfect for a childs bedroom. However when you take this beast for a spin, you may become inclined to paint the walls to match.\n\nThis isn't my first Chromebook. I own a slate grey Acer C710 with a 11 inch screen. It was hard on these old eyes of mine and I kept pumping-up the screen size to adjust. This Chromebooks 14 inch display is just right. HP is known for its build quality and the HP Chromebook 14 doesnt disappoint: excellent quality keyboard, speakers and an array of side port options such as two USB 3.0 and one USB 2.0 an HDMI port and an SD card slot for additional memory - Google take note! I love the Chrome environment. It does more than I ever use. At work I use Windoze computers and all day long I trouble-shoot Internet connection problems, password issues and viruses. Always Windoze, always windoze machines. Chrome is a pleasure to have because there are none of the burden of the Microsoft OS to worry about.\n\nThere is no Ethernet option so its Wifi only, and the display pales compared to others I have seen. There are some trade-offs to a lower price, but I dropped one Star because of this.\n\nYes, I bought the coral peach. Because Im secure in my masculinity. Wanna make something out of it??!"}

The blue color is more of a teal (according to my wife) but kind of grew on me after awhile.  It includes a small portion of free Internet data each month via t-mobile if you need it.  The display is not an IPS display like on an iPad or the Chromebook 11, but is still quite nice.  While the 14 inch size may be too big for some, it is great for adults whose eyes may be going.  And this thing lasts 9 hours of time without a break on a single charge.\n\nMy only complaints were that the colors are a bit much, the keyboard was a bit too widely spaced for my fingers, and ultimately I wanted something a bit smaller.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "HP's Chromebook 14 is our third Chromebook because, after one year with&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Samsung-Chromebook/dp/B009LL9VDG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Samsung Chromebook</a>&nbsp;I came to realize that not only a Chromebook does almost everything a laptop or a PC or a tablet would do for me but it does it cheaper, usually faster and better, almost always worry-free and very much in style. We've ordered a nice HP Chromebook 11 since and now, because someone in our household wanted a one that was 'bigger', we went for the '14'.\n\nWHY A CHROMEBOOK?\n\nThere's so much to say here but let me make a quick summary. And never forget that we are talking about an 'under 300' device here because, yes, anything that costs 3-4-5 times as much should do better most of the time.\n\n Our Chromebooks are our most used computers excluding work hours and by 'computer' I mean PCs, laptops and tablets.\n Malware, spyware, adware-free. Since nothing is really 'installed' on the Chromebook, I can't see how one would ever be infected. I am now using my Chromebook to open suspicious emails or click on dubious URLs that I don't dare touch from a laptop.\n Extremely safe OS. I don't know if this is common knowledge but Google is constantly challenging hackers to crack their OS. As far as I know, Chromium wasn't cracked yet.\n Easy to share among any number of users without any concerns of compromising privacy. If you have a Google account, you simply sign in and you are going to be within your own, personal environment.\n Constantly updated and upgraded. Google updates Chromium every few weeks and I found my Chromebook actually getting better all the time rather than slowly fall into obsolescence. HP's Chromebook will not replace Samsung's, it will be used by another family member who really, really wanted one after watching my happy relationship with our first one.\n Nearly maintenance free. Whenever I don't use a tablet or even a laptop for a while, they tend to get very busy for a while once I turn them back on. Tablets, especially, are almost impossible to use until all those dozens of updates/upgrades process. Not the case for Chromebooks. Whatever upgrades may take place don't hit my Chromebook. Whenever I call up an app, I get it in its latest version.\n The attached keyboard helps a lot. Yes, you can pair a keyboard and even a mouse to a tablet but the Chromebook's keyboard is always there, it negates the need of a stand or even some protecting case.\n Chromium is streamlined and efficiently focused where it matters, on the everyday uses most of us need a 'computer' most of the time.\n Chromium being such a streamlined OS, browsing and running apps on a Chromebook is in fact faster than off a PC/laptop/tablet of equivalent specs.\n Relatively low prince, 11.6\" display and light weight seem to be just about right for something that typically you'd be using to browse the Web while watching TV or take to and from school.\n\nWHY NOT A CHROMEBOOK?\n\nYes, Chromebooks can't do everything. Google's productivity suites notwithstanding, they are mainly and they are best at media consumption rather than production. Nobody should buy a Chromebook and expect to be able to edit video or perform some heavy word processing or do some hard-core gaming. There are other machines and devices for such tasks. My experience is that a Chromebook can't do 'everything'. Tablets are more portable, PCs and laptops are more powerful but, to me, my Chromebook is the most fun to use and it's likely to stay this way. I am not going to call it my 'second' or 'third' or 'first' computer but, objectively, it's the one most use outside business hours if what we measure is 'hours'.\n\nHP's CHROMEBOOK 14 vs. Chromebook 11\n\nHaving owned two other Chromebooks already, from the start, it was a very familiar feeling. HP's 14 is not 'exactly like' Samsung's and this big HP is quite different from HP's Chromebook 11 but it's easily recognizable as a Chromebook.\n\nHere are some changes:\n\n DISPLAY: HP 11's colors are sharper and brighter and you can view the screen from almost any angle left/right or up/down. HP 14's is not as bright and the larger size doesn't come with better resolution.\n KEYBOARD. It's a draw. I like both keyboards as they have a good layout and nice travel. As a touch typist I am comfortable with both.\n DESIGN: HP 11's is more stylish design but they are both Okay as far as I can tell. HP 11 is nicer though.\n PORTS: This is where the HP 14 wins big time. It comes with USB 3.0 ports vs. HP 11's USB 2.0 and full HDMI.\n POWER: It's not too obvious but yes, the HP 14 is sometimes faster refreshing screens. Videos play equally smoothly on both.\n SIZE AND WEIGHT: HP 14 is a lot heavier so if you travel and size and weight matters then HP 11 is the right choice. If your Chromebook is mostly homebound and most of your computing and media playing takes place in a room shielded from direct or indirect sunlight then the HP 14 gives you the bigger display advantage.\n\nOverall I like HPs larger Chromebook. It has better ports options than the HP 11, it's faster and you get a bigger screen on a body that's not as light and pretty.\n\nRATING\n\nI am not going to compare a 300 dollar HP Chromebook with the Pixel or some top of the line laptop. I noticed that many 'pro' reviewers are complaining because Chromebooks and this particular one are not 'high end' and aren't as nice as the Pixel and such. Well... did anyone check the prices? So, yes, let me make a 'duh' statement: this Chromebook is not as good as devices that sell for 3 times or 4 times as much so anyone who doesn't mind paying more should pay more and get one of those. Even though... look at some reasons above for why one my prefer a Chromebook to a laptop or a tablet, regardless of price.\n\nHP's 14 is a four-star to me because it's at least as good and in some way better than my now one year old, often used and much trusted Samsung but I personally prefer the HP 11. As far as performance, they both appear to be up to the task and they both played Netflix movies flawlessly over Wi-Fi and cast them to the big TV through Chromecast.\n\nChromebooks are not for everyone and they are not a universal computing device but, if used for what they are meant to be used, they are as good and as revolutionary as tablets."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "I finally received the Amazon version of this HP Chromebook 14. It does have 2Gb of RAM vs. the 4Gb in the Walmart-sold version. It also has no sim card slot.\n\nMy initial feelings are very positive. The size and weight feel just about perfect. Not too light/cheap feeling, but nicely weighted and portable. The keyboard is excellent. I'm \"upgrading\" from a Sony Vaio laptop and the keyboard feels very similar with just a bit of texture on the keys. Performance seems to be more than adequate, although I haven't tried to stress test it in any way yet. The Intel processor runs cool. I've only heard the fans spin up once for a minute or two, otherwise they run slowly and quietly. Battery life has been excellent. I have had to adjust to using the trackpad , but it seems to work fine. There are some settings you can change to customize it or there are plenty of USB slots if you'd rather use a mouse. Also of note, the laptop has Bluetooth built in.\n\nThe screen seems to be the weakest feature. The positives are the size and the wide range of brightness settings. The screen can get very bright, but you can all set it very low and even completely off. The HDMI port allows for several display configurations. You can mirror the display, extend the desktop, and set the external monitor to be your primary display. On the not so nice side is the resolution. 1366 x 768 on a 14\" screen is usable, but not ideal. A 1440 x 900 screen would have made me give it that fifth star.\n\nMy main gripe with the Chromebook, and from what I'm reading it maybe a Chrome OS issue, is the color temperature of the screen. The screen is clearly skewed too far in the \"cool blue\" color spectrum. I did some searching online and have found other people, using other Chromebooks, complaining about this as well. From what I can tell there is currently no fix or adjustments available. If you are into photography, like I am, be warned that the screen does not accurately reproduce colors like an Apple or Sony display.\n\nOverall I'm happy with the purchase. It makes a great \"around the house\" laptop or would be great for a high school or college student whose studies don't require special software (engineering, art majors, etc.)."}

It's plenty bright and sharp. It's much better than the Samsung 11\" screen. Granted, this HP 14\" screen is not as tack sharp as some high resolution screens I've had in $2,500+ notebooks in the past, but then this system is not $2,500, or even $1,000. Due to some online comments I had read, I was concerned about the screen before I bought it, but I am VERY happy with it!\n\nMy only knock on the system was that, initially, it did not appear to support a wireless mouse. When I first booted it, neither of my two Logitech M325 mice would work. On my second boot, however, the system's Chrome OS did an automatic \"update\", and the wireless mouse started to work fine! And it's been working flawlessly ever since! Woohoo!\n\nI must say, dollar for dollar, this is the best computer I've ever had. When I think of the $2,500+ I paid for notebooks in the past, I want to cry.\n\nMore, unlike the smaller Chromebooks, like my 11\" Samsung (which by the way is great and is being used by my daughter for school), this HP 14\" baby can actually serve as a desktop replacement.\n\nI'd give it 6 stars if it was an option.\n\nUPDATE: Microsoft is now so afraid of the Chromebook that it has hired the two old fat guys from the show \"Pawn Stars\" (who know diddly about computers) to trash the Chromebook in an ad!

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FGOTA6K", "review": "This machine is exactly what I wanted for a travel machine. Buyer beware the firmware of this machine, as mentioned in other reviews, is the Chrome Operating System using the Chrome browser. You cannot install executables or apps from outside the Google eco-system just like iPads and iTunes are married with the Apple app store. You cannot later install Windows, or any other OS, or executables outside of the Google eco-system.\n\nI cannot get the DishNetwork's DISHANYWHERE.COM sling activeX plugin (extension its called in Chrome) so that's a minor setback. The plugin only exists for the Windows or Mac operating systems, not the Chrome OS. Slingbox has a Facebook app that is supposed to work in the Chrome OS that I haven't finished futzing with to say whether it works or not. The way I made it work is use Chrome remote desktop on a PC in the Chrome browser that's already been set up to work with DISHANYWHERE (Before you try a remote desktop to it). Make sure your audio is set to simple stereo using the control panel or there will be no audio sent to the Chromebook remote desktop. Surround = zero sound.) Establish the remote desktop on the Chromebook to the PC running Chrome and remote desktop. Choppy, but better than no access to the DVR (live or recorded) content.\n\nIf your machine auto-updates (as they all are firmware set to do) and will suddenly not let you logon ever, CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+R, induces a \"wipeout\" back to firmware Chrome OS as installed at HP. The automatic updating after that worked for me. You will lose EVERYTHING that you put in the machine with this.\n\nAudio on the HDMI port can only be heard if your load (HDTV) has audio output. A 720p or 1080p HDMI monitor with NO AUDIO decoding capability means you have no audio at any time. Period.\n\nThe Chromebook is fast, clean, simple, beautiful display, and configurable within the Google ecosystem (thats a lot for a travel machine)."}

So I youtubed it and saw where many people have this issue and they have to unplug the battery and replug it back in.  This involves taking the chromebook apart. Luckily I have someone that can do that but many don't.\nThat would seem to work for a few months but then it would do it again.  After doing this about 4 times over a years time, I just accepted the fact that I have to do a hard reset when that happens and I lose whatever I am working on.\nNow my latest frustation is the sd slot. I take a lot of photos and I upload them using the slot.  Now it will not recognize the sd card being inserted. I have yet to research that but it is annoying.  I have to dig up my camera cord.\nYou might wonder why I gave it a 3 instead of a lower rating, with all these issues.  I use my chromebook daily.  I use it for both personal and business. I love it, when it is working.  As much as I have had issues with it, I would take a chance on another one, but the price would have to coe down. I can't buy a new one every 2 to 3 years.\nMaybe I got a bad chromebook.\n\nUpdate - December 2017 my Chromebook died.  The screen kept going blank. It was not a loose cord, or a fixable repair.  I sent it to a computer repair tech and they tried several different things before declaring it unfixable.  So 3 year is about the life you get from a Chromebook.  I also work on 14 inch HP Chromebooks through my agency.  My work computer does not get as much use as my personal one because I was using my personal one for both, but after I sent mine away and was waiting, I started using my work chromebook daily, and after awhile, it started doing the same thing. I had to get a new one for work.\nThese would be amazing computers if they worked out the flaws I have described in this review. A search will show these are common problems.  It is a shame.  I am debating whether I am going to get a new one for my personal use."}
