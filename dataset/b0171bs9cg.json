Haven't had a ton of time to spend with the game streaming,but it does indeed work.  The sound is far superior to most other tablets I've seen thanks to the well thought out speaker architecture.\n\nI'd give it 5 stars if it came with a charger.  :-)"}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0171BS9CG", "review": "This product almost got 5 stars and even as I type this I'm hesitant giving it 4. For reference I'm moving from an aging iPad 3 to this device. I am NOT a fan of Apple at all so switching operating systems was easy.\n\n4 stars - So why not 5? I had an issue in the beginning with the device. I powered it up, connected it, setup all of my services and was using it for a period of 4 hours. Suddenly the rotation function on the tablet broke. After uninstall apps and rebooting it a few times I decided to wipe and and prepare to ship the tablet back for a replacement. After the wipe I noticed that the orientation was working again so I settled in and configured the device one more time (Google makes this easy if you allow them the keys to the kingdom, it knew how I had it configured and re-installed all of my apps quickly). Since that re-image the device has been running rock solid.\n\nGaming - This is the primary reason I bought this device. For the record I do not care for Android gaming at all. I wanted this for the PC Streaming function. It works flawlessly. I played Fallout 4  using an XBox controller and a usb adapter for about 4 hours so far. The screen is clear and sharp enough to enjoy for extended periods. The latency is dependent on your network connection but my experience has been solid every time. I have connected from multiple points upwards of 30 miles from my house so far with NO problems. The only thing I found is the game must support controllers and it's best to play local games. Any time I tried to play online games the lag was challenging. I have NBA Jam for Android on the device but haven't launched it. If anything significant comes up I'll post an edit to this review.\n\nAndroid - This part gets 5 stars! It is a very basic OS with minimal bloatware and the only additional stuff is the PC streaming and NVIDIA game hub software. If you don't want those then don't purchase this device. Mine came with 5.1.1 but according to their website it will be getting Marshmallow.\n\nHardware - I think it feels solid. Some may complain about plastic or cheap feeling but it feels sturdy to me. The only complaint I have is that when sitting in landscape the volume buttons aren't as responsive as I'd like.\n\nAll around it's been a great device, it's snappy for social media and streaming videos. The browser functions quickly and app switching is seamless. If it wasn't for the weird rotation issue in the beginning I'd list this device as a SOLID 5 star.\n\nCons - Of course there are some cons. But in my opinion with this price all of these are beyond acceptable.\n1. Device did not come with a charger. It wasn't a big deal for me but some may be caught by surprise.\n2. Limited to 16 GB....I have a 64 GB card on order so I can test running games on it but I believe the expandable memory will cover off the limited built in storage space.\n3. No LTE - Total luxury but I wanted it, and they don't sell it...\n4. Battery life - I found that it will get me just about through the day. Today for example I've barely used it and the battery is already down to 91% after 4 hours of some light mostly idle use. Nvidia says that the battery is good for about 10 hours of use, my guess is that it's close...maybe 9?\n\nConclusion\nI've personally been waiting for the Shield version 2.0 since the first one was released. At this price though I happily bought Shield Tablet 1.5. My experience has been good enough that I'm considering buying more for my kids and wife. For the price point and the quality you are getting this thing can't be beat."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0171BS9CG", "review": "I've been casually hunting for a replacement for my old Kindle Fire HD for a little while now, keeping an eye on the various options from manufacturers like Samsung, Lenovo, and Google.  With most of the smaller tablets sacrificing features like resolution or performance to keep prices down, I was excited when Nvidia announced a re-release of their Shield Tablet for only $199 while keeping the same specifications as the initial release.  It's been a few days in with the tablet since ordering it from Amazon and so far i'm extremely impressed.\n\nCompared to other tablets in it's size and price range it performs amazingly well.  it's refreshing to see a tablet like this come in with a high res 1920x1200 screen, especially compared to Samsung or Amazon's recent 7 or 8 inch offerings with lower resolutions.  I'm mostly using this tablet for watching movies, reading comic books, and web browsing and i'm enjoying the slightly extra size over a 7 inch tablet.  Even without using the Nvidia streaming technology that comes with the tablet it functions wonderfully as just a standard Android tablet.  I love the stock Android UI as a frequent buyer of Google's Nexus phones, and with NVidia's promise of updating the tablet to Marshmallow before the end of the year it was another plus for me.  All the other features are just icing on the cake, as i'm taking advantage of the microSD card slot for extra media storage, the front facing speakers sound great for media playback, and i've already ordered a mini HDMI cable so I can plug in to a TV when necessary.\n\nI do have a few quirks though; initially when first setting up the tablet I had frequent apps lock up or long pauses and lag.  These have subsided since then, so I'm not sure the reason.  Also, while I have plenty of Micro USB cables and chargers from other old devices, it does suck to not have one included and sold separately instead.\n\nDespite the early performance hiccups, the tablet has lived up to expectations. I don't think there's many options out there that can compete with the Shield Tablet on either price, performance, or features.  As long as Nvidia continues to support it, I think it's a great device for anyone looking for something around this size."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0171BS9CG", "review": "Don't even think of getting another tablet if you are staying in this size/form factor! It's so buttery smooth. I've never felt Android quite this snappy on any other tablet (and I've owned the Nexus 7 2012, Nexus 7 2013 and even the Nexus 9). The device has a nice heft to it and the materials feel of a very high quality. Even if you exclude all of the Nvidia's gaming features, this would make for an excellent everyday, all around tablet.\n\nBut if you do take advantage of the Nvidia stuff, you'll be in gaming bliss. I haven't signed up for Nvidia's service but have been able to stream many games from my Steam library without a hitch (obviously, the controller is sold separately). Even graphically demanding games like Batman Arkham knight run nice and steady so long as your network is strong (like from a dual band wireless AC router). Didn't think I'd be big into gaming on my tablet device, but I'm sold.\n\nThe only con to this tablet is that they don't give you a single accessory in the box. Nothing. Just the tablet and some warranty materials. You will need to provide your own micro USB charger (the standard for current Android devices). I didn't let this affect my review because because I have like 100 laying around the house and I was aware of the lack of charger going into this purchase."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0171BS9CG", "review": "About 2 to 3 months ago, as I began to realize that (most likely) the Kindle Fire HDX 7 was not going to receive any more updates, I reevaluated my needs for a tablet.  It eventually dawned on me that the main reason I'd originally gravitated towards a Kindle Fire HDX was because, despite being steeped in the Amazon subsystem, it was one of the most powerful devices for the price at the time.\n\nHowever, it further dawned on me that the only content I *needed* to be able to utilize a tablet for, where Amazon is concerned, are videos and music; and those can be accessed on any Android tablet.  So I begun to look for a suitable replacement.  At the time, I considered several tablets - the Galaxy Tab S, Galaxy Tab S2, Kindle Fire HD8, and so on.  I eventually settled on, and ordered, a Galaxy Tab S, but despite being a very nice tablet, Samsung has had a reputation for barely supporting their tablets for the requisite 18 months.\n\nHaving considered the Nvidia Shield Tablet in the past, I'd been seriously interested in it, but not at the price point of $299 at the time; so imagine my surprise when the same tablet (sans stylus and charging cables) was rereleased as the Shield Tablet K1 just 3 days ago.  I returned my Galaxy Tab S and ordered the Shield Tablet K1.\n\nPut simply, I believe it is by FAR the best tablet for under $200.\n\nDisplay:  While not *quite* as nice as the one on the Galaxy Tab S, it's nowhere NEAR bad.  Accurate color representation, very bright.\nSize:  It's a bit thicker than some tablets might be - 9.3mm as opposed to the 6mm or so that a Samsung Galaxy Tab S is - but not at all unpleasant to hold.\nBuild quality:  I believe this is, aside from using last year's specs, this is where the bulk of the money was saved.  The build quality is not quite as nice as, say, the Galaxy Tab S or a Sony Xperia tablet, but it's put together well and perfectly serviceable.\nFeatures:  Aside from wireless charging, pretty much anything anyone could need - mini-HDMI, micro-USB, 3.5mm jack, microSD slot, and so on, not to mention BT, wireless connectivity, etc.\nSound:  Maybe not the best out there, but in my opinion close to it.  Definitely better than the Kindle Fire HD8, Galaxy Tab S, etc.\n\nThis brings us to graphics.  I've owned several tablets in the last few years - Nexus 7 (2013), Kindle Fire HDX 7\", Kindle Fire HD 8, Samsung Galaxy Tab S, etc.  *NONE* of them have operated as smoothly or as fast as the Shield K1.  The CPU may not be the absolute fastest out there (quad-core 2.2GHz Cortex A15), but the 192-core (ONE HUNDRED NINETY TWO) Kepler GPU is better than ANYTHING out there in any similarly priced Android tablets, and it definitely shows in normal operation.  Having used many iDevices in the past (iPad, iPad Mini, iPhone, etc.) I'd somewhat resigned myself to experiencing little 'hitches' in performance and transitions in the Android devices I've owned - things I never experienced in the iDevices I've used.  Well, the Shield K1 has changed my opinion - I have yet to have it stumble on anything, whether graphics-intensive games, basic games, movies, music, etc.\n\nSimply put, in my opinion, given the decent CPU, the PHENOMENAL GPU, and the mix of features (BTW - Marshmallow is confirmed for this device), it is THE best sub-$200 Android tablet out there, bar none.  Unless slim form factor is a huge deal for you or you're a die-hard iFan, buy this tablet if want a good Android tablet.  You will not be disappointed."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0171BS9CG", "review": "Honestly I feel I wasted my money on this tablet. They've ceased to really support it. At 1st it was great lasting a good 6 to 8 hours with heavy gaming. Then after the 7.0 update it barely lasts 4 hours. Even with the settings on mid level, putting it on airplane mode. When the community made a comment about it the brand simply ignored the issues after they told everyone to reformat their tablet. Running it on power saver mode doesn't allow for much use so it just collecting dust at this point. I can't even run regular facebook on it as it lags considerably. My cheap acer iconia tab 8 lasts longer and performs better and it;'s on kitkat 4.4.2 and not nearly as powerful with it's Quad-Core 1.30GHz and 2 gigs of ram.. The controller is expensive and clunky and the nub stylus isn't anything to write home about. I also think it's a bit bulky for a tablet it's size I understand it's to ventelate the powerful x1 processor but if it dies out at just an hour or so what's the point?\n\nWhen it was good it was a decent virtual table top /video gaming  device and work horse. I carried it around to play some pretty cool old school games like KOTOR, Baluders gate, titan quest and some recent stuff as well  like shadow run I was able  use it as an impromptu desktop as it does have an hdmi out and the bt allowed me to hook up a keyboard and mouse."}

I assume battery or some such.  I did note heat build-up.  In any event I was not going to pay the going rate for a replacement and ordered an Amazon Fire 10 as a reader.  Again the complaint is the device failed after 18 months (6 months out of warranty)"}

Besides being pissed off for them giving me a factor refurbished unit, the unit came with the HDMI slot bent and broken and they fraught with me for a few months trying to get another replacement. So finally they did and it was another refurbished unit and though the HDMI slot was fine this time around, this unit must have had hardware issues. The battery life was worse then my original.\n\nThe unit last only a day and every night had to be charged. Gaming and or watching a movie was challenging. Also, even with all the updates nvidia provided, the system was so laggy, that I finally gave in, and thought about getting this newer version, but after all this, I decided to get a Samsung s2 and although the battery life is better, it still drain fast but I can play all my games and the system runs smoothly.\n\nThen for my birthday, I was given an iPad mini 4 and I can play just about all my games, that battery must have been made by God. I use that thing everyday, play tons of games, even batter heavy ones like fallout shelter, Skype, read books, etc....and I about fall over each time because that unit lasts me 5 days with once having to charge it, and sometimes when I don't play allot but mostly read, it has lasted on me with 1 charge one whole complete week.\n\nI know others will have a better experience with this unit then I did, and I'm happy for them, but this was not the case for me, and I would have considered getting a new one, but my experience with their support turned me off to their products.  Good luck all."}

I like the attractive options such as SD expansion, etc. After doing my homework, the nvidia shield came highly recommended. My wants were primarily for Netflix/video watching and reading Kindle/ePubs. The shield was touted as a gaming tablet, which is hard to believe, for I cant say the tablet ever came off the rails. It was never on the tracks! This disappointment is one of the worst software/hardware experiences Ive ever endured! The tablet feels heavy, although is smaller in size. The battery performance is awful! I can watch a maybe 1-2 hours of videos and thats all she wrote! I have to always carry another spare battery. The absolute worst part is the clunkiness of the Android OS. Non- responsive, delayed performance is the de riguer of this device. Ive reinstalled, deleted... repeatedly. Gone on tons of posts to try increase speed by deleting apps, etc. Nothing really worked. So its time to put this dog to rest. It was only after scrolling my Amazon orders that I saw I had only purchased it a year ago! The device feels like its m five years old. And even for 200, you deserve much better!"}

It worked fine about 8 months, decent performance with too small of a battery but that's what I expected.\n\nAbout a month ago the charging port started to get a little iffy.  I bought new cables hoping mine were just old.  No joy.  Over the last month it's slowly gotten worse, and I'm now unable to charge the tablet at all.  I have not had any \"accidents\" with the device to warrant this issue.  If I had tripped on the cord, dropped the device or something similar, it would be understandable.\n\nAnyway I called a number of local phone/tablet repair shops who unanimously stated that they either wouldn't work on this type of tablet, or would charge $150+ to replace the charging port, and that i would be better off buying a new tablet.  \"Better yet, why don't you buy one of our used ones starting at only $50...\"  Right...\n\nAnyway, a decent tablet while it lasted, but I expected 2 years of life out of this thing, not 8 months.  $200 for 8 months is not acceptable even for a low end tablet."}

Then after my case was escalated, they told me it was a software issue.... I know this is NOT true because in the process of troubleshooting we re-installed android, so it lost all the android updates, and it still had the problem.\n\nIf it is software then they have not bothered to fix it in years. Personally, I believe they have defective back lights that cannot deliver stable power on the low brightness setting. Changing color, tegra color, and dynamic brightness settings never helped.

I contacted Nvidia and there were unhelpful, not offering any repair services to devices that are out of warranty. When I brought it to local shops they would not work on it, as it requires the entire motherboard to be removed and several connections on the MB to be soldered to replace it. I would not buy it again or any other Nvidia mobile device."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0171BS9CG", "review": "This tablet is the best tablet for gaming as it states. Every single game I've played was buttery smooth and no lag or problems. I tested some things like benchmarks and this tablet excelled. One thing I will warn you is that there are too many defected tablets. Otherwise this is an amazing tablet especially for it's price. Though it's only $218 after taxes doesn't mean it's bad. Just because it's not over $400+ like Apple's iPad's doesn't mean it's bad. Apple's iPad are more for productivity and not necessarily for gaming doesn't mean it's bad. I encourage you to buy one of these tablets because of it's tremendous value. But there are a couple things that aren't good doesn't mean it sucks. For instance, the battery life isn't necessarily good and the buttons aren't as good as expected. But everything here is top notch quality especially the gaming aspect all because of the Nvidia Tegra K1 chip. Everythong else is good about this tablet and the screen is very good even though they should make a 1440P variant. The screen can be fine tuned to your liking. This is all possible because of the Nvidia Prism backlighting. This is a great buy and you should buy one."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0171BS9CG", "review": "I am delighted with my purchase. I had a first gen iPad mini which was showing its age. It was crashing on websites. I thought of another ipad but trying out the latest mini in the Apple Store I still found it struggled with many websites and crashed. After a bit of research I found this which was very powerful on paper and cheaper than the iPad. After a month of use I have no regrets other than not buying it sooner.\n\nOK I have one  negative first, the the ipad  body feels more premium with its metal. But in other respects this is better:\n\n1 it has more power and memory. Everything loads faster than my piteous iPad and it has yet to crash.\n\n 2. Battery life is fine. It goes all day on normal use and 3-4 of hard use with games putting the processor/graphics at full stretch.\n\n3. Sound is pretty good with dual front speakers that are much better than the iPad, but  but don't expect Bose standalone speaker quality.  The quality of bass is poor.\n\n4. Build quality is great and it feels solid. OK it isn't metal but the rubberised speakers make it nice to hold and it feels solid.\n\n 5 Expandable storage means heaps of space for a trivial cost compared to buying the higher cost apple.\n\n6 I bought the stylus too. Nvidia supply their own handwriting recognition keyboard. using this is awesome! It is coping well with my worst scrawl. I  can use OneNote and Word well with this: combining it with the drawing ability is what OneNote was made for."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0171BS9CG", "review": "I consider myself to be pretty \"techy\". I love technology and I love the fact that android is open source. It opens up the door for all sorts of great peripherals and cool software. I have found over the years that the android tablet market is a bit lackluster unless you are looking at a nexus product. I own a nexus 5x phone and can't stand phones from other manufacturers that use custom overlays on top of android that only seems to either make the software clunky or delay future updates by months. It is because of this that I used an nexus phone and an iPad for years. I decided to take a risk and ditch my ipad for the k1. This tablet is about as close to stock as any 3rd party manufacturer I have seen. I have really been enjoying it. I purchased 2 covers, the direct stylus, the gamepad, a mini usb to usb, a mini hdmi to hdmi, and a mouse and keyboard to go with it. It is about as close as you can get to replacing a laptop unless you are talking about the Microsoft surface with those peripherals. Just take a look at the pics to see some of the things that I can do with it. I am in school for engineering and I honestly think that my homework assignments get graded easier than other because the TAs appreciate the fact that my work is so organized. I paid for the membership to use the squid app that came with the shield and I have found that while using a stylus for note taking and homework takes some getting used to, the stylus works about as well as any other one out there in my experience. There are also a ton of options to customize the software to better suit your style when using the stylus. The only thing that really hurts the productivity is the screen size. I feel like something like the surface would be a lot better at this if you can shell out the extra money for it, but we are talking about a 200 dollar tablet here and I feel like the value is phenomenal. You can also multitask with 2 apps, but again the screen size kind of makes this less than ideal. As far as gaming goes, it does it better than any other android tablet out there and there are a few cool games that run natively, but the game experience inst what I would call great. A lot of games suffer from framerate issues that just make them feel like a mess to play. Borderlands the prequel was a mess for months and they finally made it a little better, but the framerate honestly spends a lot of time in the low 20s on the lowest settings. I just don't want anyone to get there hopes to high for the gaming side of things. Try and see it as just an extra to a great android tablet and you shouldn't be too disappointed. I would recommend to get a ravpower external charger like the one showed in the pics if you plan on using it for note taking. The battery life isn't terrible, but inst fantastic. I find that I chew through about 150 percent of the battery in a day including recharges. Also the software isn't completely bug free. I find that it just randomly reboots out of nowhere about once every 2 weeks. This is just a side effect of having a product that is so open for customization and honestly probably isn't that bad when you compare to other android tablets out there. If the pros above outweigh the cons then I recommend you buy. Overall I thing the tablet is great. I hope this review helps some people and I apologize in advance, I am terrible at responding to comments if any of you decide to ask questions."}

While they were all great tablets this tablet has exceeded my expectations in every way.  I literally bought this to read ebooks and comics, but have found myself doing everything with this tablet,  The screen resolution is great,  I love watching vides, reading books and comics is really cool, I'm very old school on the fact that I like the magic of reading a book in paperback or hard cover but this is not a bad alternative.  I bought an additional micro sd card of 128gb in Geek for less than $15 bucks, so that was awesome, the one thing I haven't done so far is play games I reallly want to trow out the shield streaming service but I haven't bought a controller yet.  The battery life on this thing is amazing I've literallly gone to almost three days without charging and thats using it for comics, books and video's and still lasted more than two days.  The front sepakers are to me the best speakers I've found on a tablet.  To conclude this is the tablet to beat, and believe putting this at test against my wifes ipaid air I'd still pick this tablet and that's not talking about the gaming options this has, putting that together with evertyhing else.  I'd say this is the best tablet I've ever had and the funny thing is this tablets was relaeased on july 29, 2014 and still almost three years later is better or as superb and the tablets that are launching this year, not say way better than a lot that is on currently on the market.  Any how hopefully this review helps who ever is still on the edge to decide to get one.  I love this tablet."}

I've had older iPads in the past. I'm a big fan of apple products. As I am android. Yes I do like apple better but there's so many great things I'd love to see combined in the 2. So to have the best of both worlds, I am looking for a new tablet. I had one that was a no name android KitKat tablet but it was a piece of junk sadly. Who knew spending $100+ would be junk, right? I'm considering the fire hd 10. I'm a big fan on Amazon and their products and I like the big screen on it. Then, I ran across this and how much better gaming wise it's suppose to be.\nI will most likely use this to store pictures and use the app Lumyia to go Second Life with.\nOther than that, that's it. Of course I'm sure I'll find other uses for it, but those are the 2 main reasons of buying a new tablet.\nI'd love to have a tablet with a USB port and the option to have more storage added to it.\nEverything else I do on the computer though. So for now those would be my only uses for it.\nSo what's your thoughts on it?\nWould this be worth it for those things do you think?\nObviously, a bigger screen would be nice but better graphics vs bigger, I'd rather have the better graphics.\nI'll keep up with the comments here to see if anyone has replied.

Hearthstone lacked in performance a bit and was the main purpose of purchasing this tablet but from what I understand that is more on Blizzards side than the tablets.\n\nThe biggest flaw came in when I cracked the screen.  This is my fault of course, but the company would not in any way repair it even when I was willing to pay for it.  I looked around for screen replacements to do it myself and the only ones I found were on ebay starting at 80 bucks.\n\nEven if you get a screen replacement, there is a lengthy repair process where you have to carefully disconnect multiple pieces of the board and memorize where all the screws go.\n\nIf you ever ever damage the screen you are pretty much out of a tablet where as a more well known brand probably has an easier to replace screen and replacement parts more readily available.  I was using a case and a screen protector but it still very easily cracked.  To me, the ability to maintain your tablet is a factor which is why this has to remain 3 stars.  Once the tablets damaged, you are out of luck and my research on its screens indicates that it cracks all too easily."}

I use it mostly for drawing and watching some little video but, still I wouldn't recommend it. MOST OF THE TIME I REGRET BUYING IT. For a device intended for gaming it crashes, freezes and lags a lot. Making the gaming experience bad. After a year using it I feel like I payed $200 for a cardboard box with a tablet inside of it. Adding insult to injury now it cost like $400 and it ain't worth it. Let's no forget some problems with battery consumption and charging. It damage permanently my external 128gb micro pny sd card.\nThis version also doesn't brings the integrated pencil like the OLDER version. You have to buy it separately witch cost like $32.7. Then you ask yourself why do I need a the \"nvidia stylus pencil\"? To draw lines with more precision on the screen on NVIDIA Dabbler a cool drawing app that comes installed by default and crashes many times. but that's the only reason to buy this nvidia directStylus pen\". The app itself is made to take full advantage of its Tegra K1 quad-core at 2.2 GHz witch is very powerful compared to present day (new) android tablets under the $220.00. Currently on amazon the price tag is reaching $350.00 >>>USED or refurbished my opinion is insanely ridiculous. With less money you can find on amazon a new a tablet.\nThe little GOOD THINGS besides the tegra processor inside is the appearance that it is nice and clean once in your hand it fells good, the screen is good quality too hd720 videos looks good an games too. Gaming times of course is short. lets say if you are playing Minecraft PE, hundreds, Alto, hill climb, stuff like that. You would play for like three and a half hours and using low screen brightness. I really wanted to like this product and I think I'm still trying to. Another good thing is that you can record the screen gaming with built in recording settings you don't need to download one of those annoying advertising apps.\n\nUltimately, Now It seems to me that there will be no more nvidia shield tablets. AMD and Intel started dating earlier this month I doubt that nvidia will ever make other tablet not to forget last year nvidia gtx 970 settlement in witch the have to pa back 30 dollar to each costumer they sold this card (to in the US only) everyone else in the world is FITA according to google search. In case you don't know about it this brands. AMD and Nvidia have some of the best video graphics card on the market. But if stop and think for a while, You can find AMD in PS4, Xbox one and even Apple products. Intel make integrated graphics but their main focus is computer processors ( atom, celeron, pentium, intel core i3, i5, i7, xeon, 3m,etc.) The way I see it you shouldn't pay as more than 180 if it is new somehow and $50 if used."}

It's a blast but this tablet creates a lot of un necessary  headaches that could turn people off from a very fun hobby. Want to switch apps mid stream? Hope you like your stream going offline and all your viewers leaving.. not very ideal is it.\n\nBattery life is plain awful. From the very first charge it didn't last long at all. I would say a normal gaming session it would be at low battery within the first 2-3 hours and then it takes around 3-4 hours for a full charge, 6-8 if you're still playing the game..\n\nNow for the real reason I would not recommend this device to ANYONE.\n\nIts created its own lag. My speedtest is at 9 ping, 15 download and 6 upload. Yet once I start to play any game I immediately get massive lag spikes. When I play that same game on my phone, I have perfect ping. HOW DOES A GAMING TABLET NOT HANDLE GAMES WHILE A PHONE DOES. It baffles my mind how something like this can happen.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the graphics are gorgeous. but I don't want to look at graphics of a game I can't play properly because of lag and can't play long periods of time because the battery isn't strong enough.\n\nSave your money.

I chose this tablet over the Samsung tab and the apple tab. Boy was I wrong.\n\nDont get me wrong it has good features, like the game-stream, I am able to play few games from steam. I love the feature to add a SD card and my apps and whatnot installs on that. I like the fact, that it replaces my phone for most part for the entertainment, it has great sound and its a great sized tablet.\n\nWhat is AWFUL about this tablet,\n1. It does not come with a charger... which is pretty stupid. You need to buy a Fast charging charger or else your normal phone chargers will drain the battery instead of charging it.\n\n2. This tablet has a really bad flaw. . . It force closes out of apps. It force closes out of Google Play store, Gallery, I have counted 5 separate apps from the playstore that simply force close. It doesnt matter if you clear the cache, RAM, uninstall and reinstall, disable/ reenable the apps. I thought it was my tablet being faulty, I looked online and apparently this issue of the Nvidia K1 tablet force closing apps has been an issue since 2015!  A Lot of people have this issue and it cant be fixed and few people don't have it. I don't know if you ever had a device that did not allow you to use the Normal functions because it keeps force closing or crashing but its Extremely annoying. Plus on top of that, this known problem has not been patched or updated.\n\n3. For this being a android OS based tablet, a lot of apps that works on my phone does not work on this tablet. And all of the apps in question are games. Just want to point out that if you are getting this because you have a game in mind you would like to play or want to replace your phone with something that will play games.... This might not be it.  kingdom hearts, zombies ate my friends, spys vs robbers for starters will not work. There are few others I tried to play but it starts then force closes.\n\nThis isn't anything major but I purchased the controller, and there are a lot of games which doesn't work. If this was the thing, I wouldnt have purchased it. It is a really solid and great controller by the way.\n\nThis tablet I choose because I thought it was better than anything else out there and I am wrong. Its not. It should be avoided. I use this tablet every day, and for the games that work cool, but everything else, it force closes apps, and most importantly it force closes Important apps.

To be effective as a portable device, that implies it must have good to, at worse, decent battery life. This device's battery does not fall into either of those categories.\nI did not buy this on Amazon, but at my local computer shop. I returned it after a week putting it through its paces.\nALL the \"expert\" reviews boast about it being a good gaming device and this may very well be so with its SoC. That didn't matter to me, as I'm not a gamer. But I thought I'd get it anyway, because if it was good enough for gaming, it'd be way better for \"ordinary\" day-to-day Android tablet tasks, which for me is media consumption. Ha! I would get anywhere from 1 to 3.5 minutes per 1% battery usage doing the most minimal tasks!\nAnd, out of the box, I implemented all the power-saving recommendations. They didn't help at all. Maybe I got a bad device. Maybe, as its 2016 manufacturing date (as per the packaging), I might have gotten a device with a battery that had run its course sitting on the shelf too long.

Something very portable but with a reasonably sized screen so I started researching tablets.  My choices were the Nook Samsung Tab / Apple IPad Mini / Amazon Fire and then I stumbled on the Nvidia Shield K1.  The Shield K1 supports drawing and note taking (which I do sometimes) and was made for gaming with an HDMI out (to play on a TV screen).  It also allows you to stream games or hook up a joystick. It has graphics hardware to handle game graphics and a powerful CPU while being very portable.  I can download the NOOK app reader and if I get tired of reading play a game, watch a movie or draw.\n\nSo I took the plunge.  I have had it for 3 days and I take it with me everywhere.  I can read books and I have been playing games such as Mortal Combat X and Need For Speed and it has been great!  It is such great value for money.  The battery with intense gaming lasts for about 6 hours (but I need to do more research on this).  Graphics and game play are great.  It feels good in the hands and makes for a good ebook reader\n\nYou can check youtube or search google for more in-depth reviews on game play and using a stylus to draw.\n\nNOTE: This does not come with a power supply or stylus.

I have only owned iPads before this and anything negative about this device is due to it running android itself. There are some apps that cause it to get a little skippy with the animations. Streaming 1080p video is an issue sometimes but I think I can solve it by tweaking my wifi network or using ethernet. What it does well is games. And if your willing to spend more than $300 in all so you can get the Nvidia controller and several cables and peripherals, the experience is improved. That is probably a negative on it. But this will be my main game console emulation machine for the next 4-5 years so for that it looks like it will be worth it in the end. I can't get my mame collection on an iPad so for that alone its worth it to have something so portable. I also like that it can do everything on the TV with it for the times I want to play a movie or a game on it. Lastly, this device also works quite well as a computer by hooking it up to a tv and a mouse and keyboard. The support for the mouse and a curser is something you don't get on an iPad. So this thing could really replace a computer for those who don't need anything demanding but still need to play games. There would be compromises but its still would be a lot of bang for the buck. One star is deducted because Nvidia is not upgrading the hardware and this may be the last tablet from them that we see, which is a real shame."}

Needless to say I carried it everywhere and it worked great. Then I got the recall notice from NVIDIA so I filled it and got my replacement device thereby bricking my original. Within a year (if not less) the battery started dying on the replacement device but was unable to call them until a month or two after the expiration date of the manufacturer's warranty.\n\nUnlike other manufacturers that actually help repair or even at least advice repair options for ONE issue on an otherwise decent device, the only answer I got from NVIDIA was oh you're out of warranty. I further escalated it through talking to managers and I get the same response. Not one advice on any repair options. So basically you're telling me that once my device is out of warranty, thats it? No repair options. No nothing, despite the fact that the very part that failed was the part they claimed to have replaced.\n\nThis left a very bad taste in my mouth in terms of supporting the companys products any further. As a tech professional I find this very off-putting and utterly just irresponsible.\n\nIf you want to get this product, Id say get it at your own risk but know that if it breaks a day after your warranty expires, get ready to get left in the dark.\n\nOn that note, my 3 year-old Google Nexus tablet still works!

I installed 2-3 apps and began to play a simple game, with very basic graphics.  Never had an issue on my tablet that was 6 years old.  It ran so incredibly slow.  I went online and figured out you have to disable most of the NVIDIA features that makes this a \"great tablet\" on paper.  So I do that, and yes, it goes a little faster... at first.  Then everything force closes after a few minutes.  The tablet runs really slow, all apps, and keeps force closing apps.  Maybe I got a defective one, but I don't understand the positive reviews on this one.\n\nI'm returning this tablet now and looking into another option."}

I've been extremely careful with the tablet, but the screen is thin and a hairline crack has spread across the tablet.  The tablet was never dropped nor abused. It lasted about 5-6 months.  My best guess is that it was a stress crack caused by a temperature swing, but it's just unfortunate that NVIDIA doesn't offer any support or repair."}

Right out of the box and powered it on, once you get passed the language and email set up, it went straight to updating to Android 7.0 (Nougat).  Fast response and crisp, clear playback of videos.  The sound quality is surprisingly good given tablets aren't designed to handle stellar speaker tech.  Gaming-wise, I'll likely never push the K1 to it's limits, but video streaming and internet surfing are a breeze.  I now see why after nearly 2 years on the market, this tablet is still around.\n\n**UPDATE**\nI've had this for over a month now and still very satisfied with my tablet; no buyer's remorse here.

I use it as a tablet around the house, haven't even tried out the gaming features of it, so I don't have anything to say about it.\n\nCons:\n1.  Screen isn't terribly bright.  The colors are good, but it does lack brightness compared to more expensive devices.  This might be a factor in really bright areas like outdoors, but indoors it's not a problem.\n2.  It's only USB 2.0.  If you're trying to transfer across the wire, yea not great.\n3.  It drains the battery faster than you can charge it when you're watching/streaming video.  This was the biggest disappointment.\n4.  It's only 802.11n, not 802.11ac, but still plenty fast for streaming HD video.\n\nPros:\n1. 1920x1200 is a fantastic resolution to have.  When used to view pictures or watch video, that 1920x1200 means full HD movies without loss of resolution.\n2.  SD car slot.

I decided it was time to upgrade so that I could mainly continue with Dungeon Hunter V which I had initially started on the Kindle . It's not a new game , not an old game either . You can't get it from Amazon apps anymore , it has stopped working on my Kindle since it never updates , and it takes some decent power to play smoothly so a cheapo tablet wouldn't do as a replacement . The Shield Tablet seemed like the only tablet for gaming in it's price range . Nvidia updates their products regularly , this is running Android 7 after all updates . I can't remember when my Kindle updated last , probably several years ago .\n\nI do miss the larger HDX screen but the Shield screen is perfectly acceptable . Hopefully Nvidia offers a larger one next time around .\n\nAll my games run smooth including Dungeon Hunter .

I use my Surface Pro charger to charge it with no problems. It is slimmer than the 8 and fits nicely in the back or cargo pocket. No problem with chrome.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0171BS9CG", "review": "I'm not a gamer and only use a tablet occasionally. Mostly I depend on smart phone and light-weight notebook. Tablet used for a movie on a flight or sometimes an e-book. The price was an attractive factor to me in making a choice. My experience started badly and only got worse. I first received the tablet and downloaded a couple of movies. In the airport lobby I got ready for the flight by trying to pair my bluetooth headphones. The Nvidia pulled up 14 available bluetooth devices all identified by alphanumeric code. I was unable to figure out which was mine so used a RCA jack connector on the flight. Subsequently I discovered if there are only one or two devices available the Nvidia will identify by name, but if there are many devices available it reverts to those cryptic codes. Once paired the paired device name will appear. Like some other reviewers I've also found poor wi-fi performance compared to other devices in areas where signal is weak. This current tablet is a version of a previous shield tablet that had more features and a higher price. There is no manual or instructions so searching online for guidance can be misleading unless one is careful to ignore instructions for Nvidia shield tablet and only pay attention to \"nvidia shield K1\". Even the online help is confused about this as I spent 25 minutes on a support chat trying to activate \"daydream\" on my unit after providing build and software number. Agent had me doing resets and swapping out sdhc cards with no success. I finally gave up and placed a phone call. Luckily got a help agent who advised me the \"daydream\" function was deleted from the K1 model. Help is earnest and polite - sometimes a bit difficult to understand because of thick accent - and ranges from well-informed to poorly informed. Still I have the impression they are striving to be responsive and I get followup emails to ask if problems are resolved.  The tablet does run nougat which is an advantage for running two apps side by side. Had been using a Nexus 7 and thought about sending this one back but decided to keep it for the greater memory and sdhc slot. One of the most significant flaws is the power switch. It's only slightly raised above the side of the tablet. Hard to turn on and off. Sometimes one has to use a fingernail to depress the switch below the surrounding case to get the tablet to come on. Because it takes a while to boot up one can't always tell if the switch has been pressed far enough. Very slow to load any app or link. Touch screen seems to work sometimes, but not others.

Would be very nice at hotels and traveling with or without wifi. I used a Sandisk Ultra 128gb as a hardrive but it worked well as just a sd card as well. I would suggest to not use the free month of the shield now stuff unless you have a controller with the tablet as well. I put the tablet into a rugged case by Poetic as soon as it came out of the box so I have no clue about fingerprints or screen glare. The four speakers are nice not much base but loud enough to hear. I have larger hands and this is still very comfortable to hold in any orientation. I ordered the pwr+ 3.5 charger with the tablet and from 15% to full is less then 2 hours, I have gotten 10 hours of fairly constant use with the setting for power to be on battery instead of performance and keep the background stuff off as much as i can.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0171BS9CG", "review": "This product is a great value for the price, but has just a few design flaws. Overall the performance and sound are great, battery life is acceptable but not mind-blowing. Games run great (though I've only run Android games, and not yet used the Shield stream or controller). Expandable storage is one of its best features as I was able to get it up to a total of 150gb for like $20 bucks. There is no bloatware on the device other than some shield apps, which I don't hate. Does not heat up when running games. Screen color is good, though don't expect the quality that you have on your flagship modern cell phone. Its also pretty dope that it has an HDMI-out to use with a TV or monitor. Runs Android Nougat like a champ.\n\nCouple weird things:\nThe speaker grilles are a soft rubber and collect debris\nThe buttons have an extremely low profile and are somewhat clumsy to use by feel\nNo home button - maybe I'm just too used to one.\nOccasionally while charging, it omits a heinous ultra-high frequency squeal\nNo charger - this was no issue for me as I have a ton micro-USB cords anyway, and actually preferred not having to ultimately pay for another in the tablet price.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's a great supplement for traveling and flying, and to take the burden off my phone's battery. Would have rated a 5 weren't it just for the little shortcomings above."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0171BS9CG", "review": "I soooo wanted to give the Shield 5 stars.  For a $200 tablet it's pretty solid.  My only beef thus far with this device and one I have seen others complain about on threads is that for as much praise as their processor and ram get, I find this thing is SO SO sluggish when you first bring it out of standby.  Honestly sometimes I wait 2+ minutes until it \"catches up\" with itself and starts functioning as normal.  At most I might have 4-5 apps running in the background because I only use this for watching movies on planes, surfing the web, keeping up with emails and some basic news/sports apps.  I don't game at all, even flash games so I don't have anything big taking up ram.  But I've had this for 6mo now and it hasn't changed.  Sometimes if I close all apps before I close my case it helps, but normally it's just sluggish.  Might just be a few of us with this issue.\n\nBut that said, this thing is $200!  How you can you go wrong when everything else works fine.  Screen is decent. Not as good as a Samsung but do you really care?  Plenty of memory space with the SD card slot if you're a gamer.  Even with the sluggishness upon opening I just can't justify paying nearly $200 more for a Samsung that really can't do anything that much better as a tablet.  This isn't a phone that fits in your pocket so why pay a premium for what you don't need.\n\nUpdated review (Feb 2018). I've now had the Shield for about 1.5 years and clearly that is the shelf life for the battery. It was already a far inferior battery to the iPad mini which I could get about 8hrs of video viewing. The nvidia even at its newest never got much closer than about 5.5hrs. Now I'm lucky to get 3.5hrs on a single charge and literally all I use it for it movies while I travel. Case in point today I finished a video workout that was 43min and the battery drained nearly 44%. So just know the shelf life for this isn't great. But again for 200 I'm pretty happy to have gotten a good 12mo with it."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0171BS9CG", "review": "I wanted a tablet to use as an iPod for playing MP3's. With a 128gb micro SD, this tablet performs well.  It replaces an Amazon Fire that I only had for a couple months because the Fire is just too slow to be useful in that application.  The Shield costs more but has a dramatically faster processor and much clearer screen.  Of course it's fine for general purposes, checking weather, watching videos, reading The New Yorker and surfing. Highly recommended."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0171BS9CG", "review": "After doing a lot of research on my next tablet, I finally decided on the NVIDIA Shield K1. After using Amazon's trade in program to sell my Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.5, I wanted a tablet with front-facing speakers that was powerful. I narrowed down my choices to two. I knew the Shield had Android 6 Marshmallow. I found an article confirming Android 7 Nougat would be coming in the future which helped my decision. Two weeks later the update arrived. I was impressed. The other tablet I was considering has Android 6 available but the brand doesn't have the reputation for providing timely updates, and would likely not receive Android 7.\n\nThe Shield, since receiving Nougat, has an improved battery life while in standby that's noticably better and while using the tablet for games is demanding, it feels improved, too. I bought the NVIDIA stylus and have been impressed with the features, actually using the GPU to realistically emulate an active stylus including different pressure levels. There's no port for the stylus on the K1 so be careful if you misplace things easily.\n\nThis tablet serves so many different levels of usage. Whether you're a hardcore gamer, light gamer, or a medium level gamer like me, you're covered. There are so many ways to customize your particular needs, such as using two cores instead of four, it's insane! Don't let the fact the internals have been out a while. Even by 2017 standards this tablet is future proof. NVIDIA was right to cancel a replacement because this is not outdated at all.\n\nIt does get a little warm using intensive games but not alarmingly so. The power button is recessed and feels too stiff but you'll get used to to it like anything else. There's a faint audio \"click\" coming randomly from the awesome front-facing speakers but I'm confident NVIDIA will correct this with an update. It wasn't enough to give less than 5 stars. It is that good. I think you'll love it."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0171BS9CG", "review": "I'm somewhat disappointed in this NVidia  tablet. The specs indicate it should be quite fast with a superb display, yet my 2.5 year old ASUS Zenpad Z580, at about 60% of the price, visually outperforms it. Seems to be more responsive as well as brighter colors, and lighter in weight and thinner too.  The Zenpad wasn't great quality, though, and we've had repeated problems with the display and failure to charge adequately, so a replacement was deemed necessary before it quit.  The NVidia sometimes hesitates for seconds when a soft or hard button is pressed, and the screen lacks the dazzle that its resolution would imply. The Android is also really bare bones, without even an app to display the photo gallery, but that's easily remedied with Playstore downloads.  And probably preferable to the ton of bloatware that Samsung loads onto their tablets and phones.\n\nThe NVidia Shield certainly is sturdy. Plus, it promptly updated itself to Android Nuggat (Android version 7), which is much appreciated.\n\nUPDATE: We continued to be disappointed in the touch responsiveness and overall performance. Also had issue with the Android software using the Profile for multiple users. Kept reverting to the \"owner' profile while my wife was using it under her own personal profile. Gave up and returned the Shield to Amazon for a refund (Thanks, Amazon!). Order a Samsung Tab S instead."}

Last night(2/9/16)I tried to install update. After update it started constantly rebooting. It won't stay on long enough to even get into settings, much less uninstall update. It kept rebooting until it drained all the power and now won't recharge. It's a 200 dollar paperweight.\nUpdate 2/14. Amazon quickly and easily replaced the tablet. Got it today, powered up, went through startup and updates and encountered the exact same problem. I never even got past the home screen this time. Seriously Not Recommended."}

My one complaint is that it's screen IMO, is prone to breaking. I bought 2 last year, one for myself and one for my son. Logic would dictate that my sons' cracked first, unfortunately that's not the case. 2 months after getting it, I opened up my bag pulled out my shield and it had a crack. The bag I used was padded and has kept my laptop safe for years. The tablet itself had a case of its own and a tempered glass screen protector.  Despite this, even with a cracked screen, I'm considering buying another one. The only thing that I worry about is that NVIDIA will come out with it's kick ass replacement 20 minutes after I place my order. This tablet is consistently rated as one of the best on the market. I find it hard to believe that NVIDIA will let it die."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0171BS9CG", "review": "I bought this as a mobile device for a remote controller for a drone.  I have been using an iPad Mini 2 as the screen for the controller, but I was looking for something that would be brighter in strong sunlight.  The fanboys on the drone forums all said this was the brightest and best.  Since it is in fact the least expensive I got one (it is $70 cheaper than a new iPad Mini 2), but the screen is not visibly better in bright sunlight than the iPad Mini 2.  It is okay, just not better.  Indoors the screen is very nice.  Second, it takes much longer to do a cold boot (e.g., from a turned off state) than the iPad.  Third, (this is a problem with Android, not NVIDIA) the apps I wanted to run only were available for iOS.  Bottom line, if you want an Android tablet, this is okay, and probably the best bang for your buck.  Better, however, to figure out what apps you want to run then choose between iOS and Android."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0171BS9CG", "review": "This is now the second try I gave the Shield K1. The first time was about a year ago, right as Marshmallow was being rolled out. Marshmallow was going to save the day and do away with the need for the user to decide where apps are stored (internal or microsd)... When Marshmallow 6.0 arrived, sure enough it was buggy to say the least. Android system would constantly stop responding, spawning an error message. The tablet was also laggy and slow to respond to clicks. Where was all this firecracker power nvidia boasted about in the specs?? I returned it. Now, early 2017 I was looking for a fast tablet once again. I gave the K1 a try again, since Marshmallow is now better and more stable, at least on my phone (Nexus 6P) and my phone is now running Nougat without any issues. Since Nougat has been promised by Nvidia to come to the Shield, who knows when, they keep delaying... So I try the Shield K1 again and sure enough, it's the same buggy hot mess it was last year. The OS itself is still buggy on it (not Google's fault, but Nvidia) the play store just refuses to download apps just about every hour, needing a tablet restart to resolve. The wake up is buggy too, it is slow, lags and plain frustrates me when I need to use the tablet. Games like Hitman and Space Marshalls 2 LAG on this device. Are you kidding me?? These 2 games run fine on my Kindle HD 8 which is a tablet people laugh at when you mention games. The joke's on Nvidia however, since at least in my case, the Kindle HD 8 outperforms the Shield any day. The shield might have killer specs and showoff processors, but the buggy operating system Nvidia put on it renders it useless to me."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0171BS9CG", "review": "I absolutely love this thing. I was considering a bigger tablet (like the Galaxy Tab 10.1) but after read reviews, I pulled the trigger on this tablet instead.\n\nAnd I've very glad I did.\n\nIt's the fastest tablet I've ever used, and just as a standalone device it works wonderfully. I ran into a few hiccups with connecting to the 5ghz wireless signal from my router, but it turned out it wasn't a problem with the tablet, but my router settings. Once I adjusted it, it worked without issue (no dropping wireless).\n\nFor the performance you get, the battery life is also very impressive. For just Gmail/Facebook/Twitter use, I can use this for days without charging (have to charge it nightly if I'm gaming on it).\n\nWhere the device really shines is when you pair it with the Nvidia Shield Controller. It's a perfect integration, and if you use a third party mount, it makes it feel like a modern, powerful Gameboy. GeForce Stream works OK for simple Steam and Battle. Net games (I can watch DOTA 2 matches on the tablet, but could never play it with this control scheme). I have also successfully played Overwatch and Hearthstone using this setup, but will admit sitting at my desktop would be preferable.\n\nThe GeForce Now optimized games are amazing, however. I've been playing Just Cause 2 (for free*) and it never lags, never skips, and looks beautiful. I can't believe you can get this much gaming out of a tablet, especially for $200.\n\n*Through the GeForce monthly service ($8 a month, first month is free)."}

I've used 3rd part software to calibrate the gyro, but that didn't help. The only thing that \"fixes\" it is to power it off/on. But then as soon as I put it in hibernate and then turn it back on again, it won't rotate.\n- The volume button is backward and nearly even with the frame. Very difficult to use.\n\nSo, while it does SOME things better, it still needs some work before it's an overall better buy."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0171BS9CG", "review": "I have waited a long time to write this review, since I wanted to have a lot of experience with it before doing so. I was very impressed with the specs of the tablet and the fact that it was a dedicated gaming tablet was a definite point in its favor. I assumed that a gaming tablet would have a lot of power and battery life. Well, not so much. I don't play the typical teenage war/shooting simulation games, and I do not need a controller. The game I play all the time is Township by PlayRix. This is apparently very intensely graphic game with a lot going on. I actually burned up the battery on my iPhone playing the game before buying this tablet. The graphics are great; the battery life is not. It is not unusual for it to suddenly power down during the game because the battery has run out.\n\nAnother issue is that it is not unusual for the tablet to download and install an update to something on the tablet right in the middle of play, which then causes the tablet to restart itself. That is rather annoying, to say the least.\n\nThe price is great and performance isn't bad, but it doesn't compare to an iPad. Just as on my Asus (also Nvidia Tegra) tablet, I see a lot of pop-up boxes informing me that a program isn't responding and do I want to Wait, Report, or Close. I feel that something is wrong with a processor that can't handle making utilities or programs work.\n\nIt also takes too long to boot up or wake up."}

Its a gaming tablet, so Id expect speed and performance. And at first, that was the case. But as time went on, it slowed more and more. This was particularly evident when Id turn if off Airplane mode. The tablet would essentially freeze while it was thinking. During this time, which could be several minutes, it was nearly impossible to open a program...especially if there were App updates.\nGranted it wasn't like waiting for an old dial-up modem to connect, but it was slow.\n\nThis week, I decided to start over. I restored the tablet back to the factory setting, erasing everything. (UGH!!) I only reloaded a few essential programs Id need for vacation next weekKindle, Dropbox & OneDrive, Facebook, etc. I was hopeful, but today, its already slowed down significantly.\n\nIve owned other tablets in the past, including a Dell and a Nexus. Ive never had this kind of performance issues. They were all 7 and Id decided to go bigger. Now, I wish I hadnt. Or that Id gone with the Galaxy Tab, which was my first choice.\n\nIll take this one on vacation with us...cause I don't have the time to get a new one and get it set up before we leave, but after we return, Im breaking up with Nvidia Shield.\n\nBased on all the glowing reviews here, I seem to the be the only one whos dissatisfied.

I like the ability to play games and run games from my pc.  battery life is not good and it gets warm, but it's a lot beefier than my past tablets.\n**Update to Review after several months of use.\nI still love the tablet, but have come across a couple items that may be of interest.\n1. If your playing a game remotely off your PC (Fallout 4) and using the K1 to view this on another device you may need a special cable.  You will also need Nvidia set up on your pc and it must be a flawless install.  I have finally been able to play Fallout 4 on the tablet and project on to a tv, or monitor however it does drop WIFI signal quite a bit.  Some days are better than others and I have found no setting issues that would cause this.  You will need to turn on your WOL (wake on Lan) feature for this to work well.\n2. Once done playing Fallout 4 when I shut down to desktop, 80% of the time it locks my PC to a black screen.  The bummer about this is i travel.  I have been able to use this at another location on my pc and it works pretty good.  However, it does suck if I am out of town and my pc locks.  Not much I can do when on the road.\nWhen it works and the stars are alligned, it's great.  when it's Picky, it's just Picky."}

I guess I should have read that in the description, but who makes a tablet and doesn't include the charger? And why is it $30? I don't need foreign adapter capability. I'd rather just pay $10-$15 for a normal American adapter. Now I own the adapter, and it does work well. I still feel like it should be included.\n\nThe device can get pretty hot. It is powerful, but it doesn't regulate as well as I would like. I even overheated once--but it did recover after it wouldn't turn on for a while (presumably a safety feature). I recommend playing games in power-saving mode unless they won't run that way, or if you are playing briefly. The processor is so powerful, most games will run the same or just barely slower."}

Over the course of this past year I have seen the uses of this item increase and the ease of being able to even stream my comp games across the country on hotel internet has been amazing! I only run a gtx 660, i7 860 2.8 ghz, 8gb ram and being able to stream from Colorado to Florida and Colorado to San Fran on the hotel internet of Crowne Plaza and Double Tree has made it to where I don't need to bring a laptop to game. Ex of games I am able to stream are Batman Arkham City, The Witcher 2, Vermintide, Jackbox party pack and Bastion just to name a few. Like any gaming device battery life is not great I can 2 hours of streaming games or 6-8 watching movies and shows which is good for long car rides and plane rides.\n\nNot only is this a gaming tablet, it can do anything a normal ipad/tablet can do especially if one uses google hangouts, discord or skype. So like for facetime and messaging one could use hangouts for all that especially if you are an android user. It does lack a little storage space (16gb), however, I purchased a 32gb memory card which is plenty for myself. The memory card bundle is a steal so get that because when flying one cannot stream so being able to download shows from Netflix/Plex makes travel so easy to catch up on shows.\n\nDid I mention you could play emulators on this!\n\nI can't say enough good things.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0171BS9CG", "review": "This is a hit from Nvidia. This tablet fulfills the needs of someone who wants to extend their desktop PC elsewhere with a controller like the steam link devices. However, it also is a tablet that allows you to run normal tablet activities such as browsing and anything else that runs on android. The major flaw that I wish they would build into the next generation of these is that it's still bound by bluetooth mice and keyboards. Not all of them work either, so you have to research the ones that do. This is a major hindrance in a device that can easily replace a small web browsing laptop and more for someone that has a custom built desktop PC and doesn't need or want a laptop.\n\nAdditionally, I don't know if Nvidia knows how much these have spread and caught on in the drone market. These are one of the few tablets that have the processing power to handle communications with products from DJI drones. They also rarely have communications and compatibility issues. When they do it stems more from issues with the drone and android instead of the drone and the tablet. Finding another tablet with this much horsepower that has a GPS module built in (that allows full compatibility with drones) would cost far more in another brand. Most brands require you buy a cellular network connected tablet which will come at a premium.  It's a shame that the \"ultimate\" android tablet for drone streaming was designed for something else and the manufacturer seems unaware of the market potential it has there."}

I am definitely happy.\n\nOut of the box:\nAfter I did my basic hookup to my Wifi, I had a bit of a scare.  The windows started jiggling, the screen didn't respond well to touch and it took me a while to just turn it off.  However, once rebooted that problem vanished, it downloaded a huge update and it's been sweet ever since.\n\nPros:\nNearly everything... decent price, vivid screen, Full HD, loud speakers.\nActually, the Full HD is a bit larger than bare bones 1080, it's 1920x1200!\nMini-HDMI with HDCP 1.4 output for TV, it's a gaming system after all.\n\nCons:\nI wish there was more internal storage, it's only 16GB (minus OS overhead), down from my ZenPad S 8's 64GB.\nI'm still searching for its File Manager, my old ZenPad had a nice one.\nMinor issues, the screen shows fingerprints more than my prior tablet and it comes without charger and cable but by now everyone has plenty of spares.\n\nEDIT:  Well, make that 2 Shield K1 tablets so far this month, I gifted a friend with my first one.  To clarify about the 16GB internal memory, I'm told that's not such a big issue with the newer Android versions (this is 6.0) and newer apps, the internal and external memory should be better blended together.  Still, I would have paid a little more for bigger internal memory.\n\nEDIT Feb 11, 2017:  Android 7.0 was announced in the past week and it just downloaded OTA to my Shield.  Smooth transition.  Now the latest and the greatest!"}

My experience with graphics intensive apps, games, and web videos is that they run FAST and SMOOTH on this tablet.\n\nI bought one for our 4 year old toddler because he was getting impatient when apps were taking a long time to load on another brand tablet designed for kids.  Now he can explore the math and reading games so fast without excessive switching and loading delays, it keeps his interest much better than the previous tablet.\n\nThe sound is excellent for a tablet, much better sound than any of my iPads. It has a nice clear musical dynamic range and a nice stereo effect.  Since this tablet also has 1080p high resolution, it's perfect for watching movies.\n\nThis tablet becomes kid-proof indestructible when combined with a Poetic Turtle Skin case and Sparin Screen Protector.\n\nSetting up a kid's sandbox is easier than I originally imagined, even without using any 3rd party parent control apps.  All I had to do was to create a new kid profile and make it a restricted profile.  Then I go into the settings, users, and I can select which apps our toddler is allowed to use.  The restricted profile prevents other changes to the tablet configuration.\n\nI was able to get Amazon Prime Video onto the tablet by downloading the Amazon Underground app and installing it from this alternative app store (Amazon has an article on the simple steps to do this).  Now we can access all the kids shows as part of our subscription to Amazon Prime and Amazon FreeTime Unlimited.\n\nI was wondering what Nvidia is going to do for the next version of this tablet.

I wanted a smaller tablet to use for movies, news, and my aviation apps.\n\nPerformance-wise, the K1 lives up to the reviews. It's fast, nearly no hiccups, buttery smooth from app-to-app, and the dual front facing speakers are certainly well above average.\n\nSo why the two star review? Wifi. It's horrendous. Worse than horrendous. It's 1997 dial up terrible. Even worse, it comes to a screeching halt when you hold the tablet near the wifi antenna corner (lower side where power/vol buttons are). Can anyone say iPhone 4?\nI assumed I had a lemon and sent it for an exchange. Same deal. A quick Google search proved this was indeed an Achilles heel for this device.\n\nEven when I was in the same room, 12 feet away, the wifi was mediocre compared to my phone, via the Speedtest app. Sadly, the 5Ghz was SLOWER than the 2.4Ghz. I tried watching Netflix standing right next to the router (150MB Verizon Fios), and it lived in buffer hell with no hope of escape.\n\nIf you want a device that will forever live in Airplane mode, you can't beat this. If you actually intend on connecting to the outside world, save yourself the trouble. Fork over some extra cash and get a tablet that works. I ended up with a barely used Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 for $50 more than the K1.  It's like an enlarged Galaxy S7 - runs great, works great."}

Its important that I state I purchased this product for non gaming use. I use it for my business mostly with some very mild entertainment uses. The tablet works as stated to my enjoyment! Very Very powerful ! Like I said I haven't tried very taxing games but I don't think it would struggle. A not of mention is the screen size. Make sure you realize it is only an 8\" tablet. Also I would like to mention the 2 main issues that people have with the tablet. First is the updates and how they \"break\" everything. I have went through 3 updates since having mine and it has worked flawlessly. Second is the battery life. With my general business use my battery last almost a full week on charge. Heavy use like watching movies and what not maybe a few days. Not an issue for me and should not be the reason you shy away from this tablet.\n\nFor the price I don't think you can get any better.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0171BS9CG", "review": "This thing is amazing. You simply won't find a more powerful tablet at this price range. Runs everything I can throw at it with no hangups during play. Borderlands, GTA, a myriad of touch based music games, all run flawlessly. Can be made even greater with a Shield controller or, as I prefer, a corded USB controller with a USB OTG attachment (works better with emulators).\n\nPhysically it feels sturdy. The power and volume buttons take some getting used to though. It is with these buttons that you get a slight sense of cheap construction but it's negligible unless you're super finicky.\n\nMy only gripe with this is the lack of an included charger. The one you charge your phone with will suffice but if you use one of those while playing anything on the device you actually lose power just at a slower rate. I highly recommend you get a powerful charger if you want to be able to charge and play simultaneously. I took away half a star for this.\n\nAt full charge the thing can go for about 4 to 4.75 hours. Your mileage may vary depending on the apps or games you use but I feel it's a bit short. Couple that with the lack of a dedicated high speed charger and it can be vexing. Minus half a star for that.\n\nBut at this price point and the amount of raw power the Tegra K1 chip provides its power flaws can be overlooked if you properly accesorize it with an appropriate charger."}

This tablet rolls thru games, apps, casting to televisions, streaming HiFi media, etc. Without a hitch.its expandable media works just great. I purchased a Samsung 128 GB micro SD card and haven't looked back. I purchased a third party case and remote and the K1 gave me no issues, period. The geforce now is new to me, however I have had no issues streaming games, I don't experience lag or frame rate issues. My wife and I have the same tablets, same setups as far as SD cards covers etc. We love this tablet and both highly recommend it."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0171BS9CG", "review": "So this tablet as just an android tablet is pretty awesome and a very good buy for the price. But I purchased this tablet for it's gaming capabilities. First off I will say that geforce gaming streaming and the available games are good and worth the 7.99 a month. The graphics are great and I have no problems playing with the graphics maxed out on my home wifi. The only major downside for me and why I gave 3 stars is that so far I have had horrible luck with 3rd party gaming controllers. I have a moga pro and a matricom bluetooth control. The moga won't work at all and the matricom only works when it feels like it, maybe 50 percent of the time. Now this could very well be the fault of the controllers. However the fact that I can't find an nvidia gaming controller anywhere as it is out of stock everywhere I have looked puts the blame on nvidia. Nvidia really needs to do a better job at supporting their tablet and I am at the point now of almost returning the tablet for the lack of a reliable controller.\n\nI really love this tablet and it's gaming capabilities. But my kids and I are beyond frustrated with having to fuss with the controllers we currently have that work just some of the time. If anyone has any suggestions on a reliable controller or if nvidia finally decides to have their controller available so I can buy it then that would be great."}

I have had it for about five months now, bought it for $199.\nPerformance wise , it's the smoothest Tablet I have had.\nWhile investigating this one before buying I did come across that the old nvidia shield had excessive heat issues. Now with this one , I did notice them but only when you run too many high memory apps at a time.\nMake sure to not use more than 50% memory/disk space and good performance is all but assured.\nHappy with purchase."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0171BS9CG", "review": "After using a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 7.0, this tablet is incredible.\n\nPros:\nEXTREMELY fast performance. It seems to be just as fast in most apps as my friend's iPad, and I always load in first in multiplayer games (Asphalt 8), so this is a very fast tablet.\n\nDisplay is great. It's sharp, but very dim at night and bright during the day.\n\nFront-facing speakers sound good because they are front-facing, not because they deliver great audio. For most games and movies it's good, but don't expect to listen to music unless you're just pumping out some jams to dance to or share.\n\nBattery life is good if you use the \"Optimized\" performance setting. I didn't notice much difference in performance from that and the \"Max Performance\" settings.\n\nAndroid 6.0 is pretty much stock. There's a few apps that are pre-installed, the rest seems clean. While Nvidia's launcher (awkwardly named Launcher3) is OK, I'm using Asus's Zen launcher as it looks a bit nicer and lets me hide apps.\n\nCONS:\n\nBattery charge time is awful. Yesterday I ran the battery to empty, plugged it in and the tablet said \"6 hours till fully charged\". And it seemed pretty accurate. While the battery life is good, it takes a while to charge.\n\nSide buttons have no \"click\" to them, and tactile feel is terrible. Overall Nvidia needs to get better button mechanisms as there buttons are very mushy when pressing them.\n\nRubber covers the front-facing speakers. While it feels nice when touching, I'm worried that over time the rubber could show signs of wear and even tear. I would have preferred plastic/metal speaker grills.\n\nNo power brick included... guess Nvidia figures we all have them anyways.\n\nOverall for $200 this is an amazing tablet, and if you want a blazing fast tablet with good battery life and near-stock Android 6.0, this is it."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0171BS9CG", "review": "I bought this to replace my Nexus 7 (2012) which finally gave up the ghost with a hardware problem. I'm not a big gamer, but decided to go with this tablet for the price, name, and the fact it has a strong graphics core (while is obviously great for games), also speeds up general web surfing too, thus making this tablet very snappy with pretty much anything you throw at. Battery life is great if you're not gaming, but with any device such as  laptops, tablets, even apple products, battery life will suffer when gaming because for the simple fact games use up CPU horsepower which require power!\n\nThe tablet has an amazing screen and is just the right size for portability, 10\" tablets are just too big IMHO and can be difficult to hold, this will be a lot easier to travel with. It's a little heavier then I would like, but not overbearing, but that might be because I was use to my 7\" Nexus 7, while this screen is a 8\".\n\nI have to admit I didn't fully read through the description and was a bit surprised that it doesn't come with a charger or even charging cable. It uses a USB to micro-USB port cable which most people will probably have kicking around if you have a smart phone or older tablet. Even so, for an extra $10 Nvidia should have thrown something in for newbies getting this as their first product.\n\nAs a gaming tablet is a bit light with on-board memory being at 16G, now a days even 32G is light...thankfully there is a microSD port for memory expansion and buying extra memory is cheap enough.\n\nOverall happy to have bought this and looking forward to many years of use out of it!"}

This tablet IS fast and packs a lot of useful features but the one thing that really frustrates me and is very annoying is when you first wake the tablet. It is sooooo sloooooow in opening and sometimes take a min to give you the login screen and even when you login the screen will blackout causing repeated presses of the mushy power button. This is particularly noticeable after a long period of down-time like after a charging period or say over night.\n\nI suspect this is a result of the K1 chip not being compatible with the \"Doze\" feature in Marshmellow 6.0. With that said, I still like this tablet only because of the intended use, gaming but sometimes I really want to throw this at the wall because of the slow wake-up/boot-up times when you first open the tablet.  The battery use is decent where I've managed an average of 3 to 4 hours onscreen time before needing to charge, however I am a power user so this may vary for some users."}

The specs look underwhelming on paper, and who wants to get tied into another monthly subscription?  I mean that's where its supposed to shine right, the gaming/game streaming?\n\nWell, I guess I want to be on another subscription...  This went from a casual interest to coming very close to bumping my N7 LTE out of my daily carry ranking.  The slightly larger screen doesn't show up when I'm trying to find a corner of my pack to shove it into, but it definitely registers on my eyes after long use.  It also feels nicer in use and has better buttons than the N7.\n\nI've also been exploring Nvidia's game library to an extent that my early concerns about productivity have taken a back seat.  It really adds something, even to just go through and play a few of their free with membership games.\n\nI took it on a business trip to Yakima thinking it'd be a great way to keep up with email and such, and wound up streaming Crysis 3 for hours, from my desktop PC in Longview.  Using Hotel WiFi of all things.  It's the most usage I've gotten out of my desktop PC's Nvidia graphics card since I bought it.\n\nI'd highly recommend getting the bundle that has the controller in it; you may not think you'll use it for gaming, but you never know."}

When i got this about three days ago the first thing i did is connect it to my WiFi and and then updated the system to marshmallow 6.1 It will automatically do this if you just leave it sit and connected to your WiFi. It has also been stated there has been WiFi issues with this tablet. My solution for that is to go into settings and turn off WiFi sleep, Although i have not had any problems at all. If you plan on using a HDMI cable make sure in the volume in settings that the slider for media set to at least center or you may not hear any audio. The battery life is about average for a tablet this size. If you plan on doing some long game play i would suggest plugging the tablet in to a charger and keep the battery up. It will get a little warm but that is normal and will not hurt anything. All in all I'm happy with this tablet it runs games and apps good.

This is my third tablet. I still have a Nexus 7 (2013), Samsung TabPro 8.4 and now this. When it works fine, it is on par or better than the TabPro. Here are some of the problems I've been having...\n1) Has trouble coming out of sleep.\n2) Becomes unresposive at times (seems to not be able to multitask very well)\n3) SD card wasn't recognized at one point, and after a few reboots, it finally came back\n\nI haven't seen any WiFi problems with it, but this was a big knock on my TabPro until I got an app that helped it connect to WiFi more stably.\n\nWhat I've noticed is that it works great for about two days, and then the sleep trouble happens. It clears out if I reboot the tablet, but my other tablets didn't need this reboot every couple of days. I upped the performance to max thinking it might help, but no dice. I also downgraded the app needs of one of my mail apps to see if that will help. Still checking on that.\n\nOn the pluses, the battery life is good. The screen is very nice, but the auto brightness controls seems to brown some of the white colors. It has a great speaker setup for a tablet. HDMI out, but I haven't tried that yet.\n\nEDIT: 1/2/2017\nI've gotten the sleep issues to be a bit less of a problem. I turned off all optimization. No app optimization and the tablet is set to running at max. It still stalls a little bit, but getting closer to my other tablets. I haven't had to reboot it as often as before either, but still doing it way more often than expected. I would up my review by a half star if I could, but I don't feel it's worth four full stars\n\nEDIT: 4/1/2017\nThis first Android 7 update appeared to somewhat fix the sleeping issues, and seems to have stablized the SD problem. Unfortunately, they did another update (Shield 5.1?) that put the sleep problem right back to what it was. I'm seriously thinking about getting rid of this thing and finding something else. It's frustrating to see how well my old Nexus 7 and Samsung  tablets are zippy and responsive.\n\nEDIT: 7/5/2017\nI can finally recommend this tablet to people. The update that came out a few weeks ago finally resolved much of the big items.\n1) Coming out of sleep is not longer a problem\n2) Unresponsiveness has gone away.\n3) SD problems appear to be gone now\n\nOnly complaints I would have now are that the WIFI isn't as strong as I would like, and battery usage took a little bit of a hit with the latest update. For this reason, I updated my rating to a 4 of 5. If I could, I'd give it a 4.5."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0171BS9CG", "review": "I've been using this tablet for months and I still absolutely love it. It runs my apps quickly and has not experienced any slow down in performance over time. I did eventually fill the space it had but it's using the extra space from the large sdcard I added seamlessly (I opted for not being able to remove it so it could put that extra space to best use). The only hiccup I've had is my very old version of winamp on the PC I got for free that I still use seems to have a bit of trouble transferring playlists to the extra memory, but that's it. All other apps seem to be using it fine. I do a lot of gaming and it's run all of my gaming apps very well without crashes or lag (unless it was the games fault, but so far never the tablet!) I charge it overnight and if I just use it for the calendar, checking some e-mails, and maybe an hour of gaming it holds it's charge all on it's own. On the days I've managed to get hours of gaming in I have charged it while playing off a USB to power outlet converter and it will still recover it's charge even while I'm using it. If I plug it into a USB port on the computer it will still just barely slowly lose it's charge as I play and after a few hours will eventually make me stop playing so it can recover. I've also plugged it into an external battery pack while playing and had no trouble with that either. I've used the wireless from our home wireless, two different cell phone hotspots, and different store wireless and they all connected fine and worked well for the most part. It has been disconnecting from the wireless just for 30 seconds or so once about every 20 minutes and then reconnecting itself, but it's very difficult for me to say with certainty whether that is due to the tablet itself or the wireless stability. If you're just web browsing or checking e-mail you wouldn't notice anyway, I only notice when in the middle of an online game that pauses while it reconnects. Sound has been acceptable, it works perfect for most beeps and boops in games and such and I can hear it just fine at it's lowest setting when in quiet environments and I don't think I've ever turned it all the way up even in loud environments. While I typically turn music off in most games, I do occasionally just listen to music, and the sound quality is adequate for a tablet. Volume is fine, I can hear all the different high and low tones, but of course being a tablet it doesn't exactly rattle the windows with bass, but neither do I expect it to. Touch sensitivity has been perfect for me, I don't ever feel like it's not registering what I'm doing and it never has trouble keeping up with my swiping around on the screen's keyboard. Screen brightness is great, I turn it all the way down in bed at night and can see it fine. I put it somewhere in the middle when I'm sitting around the house or inside buildings, work, etc. And when I'm standing outside in full sunlight or sitting in the car on a sunny day I can usually still see the screen after turning the brightness all the way up, perhaps with a bit of a tilt of the screen also as needed. Overall, I'm very happy with this tablet!"}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0171BS9CG", "review": "Shortly after receiving my new Shield K1, I was very excited to set up and use Gamestream. Sadly, this product does not include a cable or charger, which shouldn't have been problematic...except, it was. Only one of my five micro USB cables is able to supply enough amperage to charge the tablet fully overnight; the others barely hold the battery percentage in place.\nBattery life: 2-5 hours, depending on use. Running native games such as Half Life 2 suck the battery dry far quicker than I'd like, and even at a light load, my HTC10 was able to outlast this thing. A tablet browsing the web with low brightness should NOT be beat by a mobile handset!\n\nThe main reason I have given the device 1 star, is due to the EXTREME Wi-Fi issues. While the Android OS reports 4-5 bars in both of my testing environments, attempting to use Gamestream or GeForce Now results in frequent disconnects, high latency spikes, and reports of poor bandwidth and packetloss in-game. To make matters worse, there are forum threads on XDA and NVidia's community sections dating back to 2014 with these issues, with NVidia promising that this is a 'high priority issue'...sorry, clearly it is not. With download speeds of 25-50% of what my other devices can pull on the same networks, the huge packet loss (reloading Chrome tabs almost every page load), and the ridiculous issues with the key feature (game streaming), this is a waste of money."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0171BS9CG", "review": "I still consider this the best \"smaller\" Tablet you can buy right now even though the specs have not been updated in two years.  I have been waiting on Google to release a follow up to their Nexus 7 but they are really dragging their feet.  I needed something to replace a 2012 Nexus 7 that is basically dead.  Samsung tablets are nice but they are way too expensive and they are very unfriendly to people who like to customize (ie. root) their devices.  Then there are the cheap Chinese brands I know nothing about so I avoided those even though the Huawei Mediapad M3 looks like a decent device.  nVidia doesn't care what you do with your device so rooting and customizing is as easy as it is on Nexus devices.  As a nice bonus the Shield tablet has a really nice optional controller you can buy (if you can find one at a decent price.  A large brick and mortar store with a yellow sign still carries them).  The tablet seems to run smooth and fast.  I really have no complaints with the tablet so far.\n\nIt is very unfortunate that nVidia has seemingly cancelled their plans for any future devices due to their involvement with Nintendo's new Switch console.  I say it is unfortunate because the Switch, while similar in form, will be nothing like an Android tablet.  It is a proprietary, closed Nintendo console so it really isn't a device I would consider as a replacement to an Android tablet.  I think tablets are a very small niche market now days and few companies offer what I am looking for in a device.  nVidia and Google seem to be the only two.  nVidia seems to be done and who knows what Google's plans are.  As far as tablets they may be finished as well.\n\nNow, to my complaints.  I actually bought three of these tablets recently and a fourth back when they launched originally.  My launch tablet had a screen defect (there was a bright pressure spot on the screen you could see on a light colored background) so I returned it and bought a Nexus 7 and didn't own another Shield tablet until recently.  Fast forward to Black Friday... I purchased three of them, one for me and two for my kids.  One of the three was defective.  The sound didn't work at all through the speakers nor the headphone jack.  I know issues can happen and replacing it was easy enough through Amazon.  However, the replacement tablet has a very small screen defect in it that is exactly like my original launch tablet two years ago.  It has a bright pressure spot that you can see on a lighter background.  Now, this tablet is for my young son (5 years old) to use and he will never notice the defect (to be fair it is very minor and I am sure a lot of adults wouldn't notice it but I do) and the tablet will end up getting beat up anyway so I am not going to bother replacing it a second time.  I just don't like that 50% of the nVidia Shield tablets I have purchased have been defective in some way.  That is not good quality control in my opinion.  I'd take a half star if I could for the inconvenience of having to seal with an exchange even though it is very, very easy and costs nothing to send back the defect.\n\nAnyway, overall I really like this tablet.  The one I am using is perfect and seems to be doing everything I want it to do very well.  I wouldn't hesitate to purchase one even though it hasn't been upgraded in two years.  There just isn't anything significantly better out there right now in a similar price and size."}

It is also exceptional for playing my MOBA games on for android.

My son owns the asus zenpad s 8. Two of those 3 I mentioned are awesome tablets. The lenovo lags behind. Enter the nvidia shield tablet k1. I've had my eye on this since it was released. I still think this tablet is the best bang for the buck.\n\nThe asus is really good too for value. It costs $100 more but u get a ton of ram,  double what you get with the shield.\n\nMy son thinks the shield runs the games better than his asus. I might agree with that. But it's not a huge difference to me. The aspect ratio is different making the gaming experience very different.\n\nI believe the shield is a solid tablet with the hardware to last a while. These days technology advances so quickly things are outdated after you buy them. But I'm sure I will be keeping this around for a while.\n\nThe shield has decent front facing speakers. That's a very nice feature. It feels solid in my hand but light enough to hold and read for a long time. I don't find the screen that big for an 8 inch screen. The screen is sharp and movies look pretty good on it.\n\nWhy if I own a pixel c would I want this tablet? Good question. I wanted something good but a little smaller. The pixels is great but it's kinda big to hold for a long time. The shield also seems a little better for selection of games. Oddly, there was a game the pixel wouldn't support that the shield would.. Runs smoothly too.\n\nI am very pleased with the shield tablet. It's a good buy if you are not looking for a big tablet. I personally would get this over any samsung any day.\n\nHope this helps. I'll modify as I go."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0171BS9CG", "review": "I bought this tablet to replace an aging, slow-as-molasses-in-January Acer whose memory became an unmanageable bottleneck even after a thorough root-n-ROM treatment.  So far, it's been a perfect replacement, with good ergonomics, a decent screen, adequate performance under the hood and actually OK stereo speakers.\n\nPositives:\n\n* It runs cool! Compared to my phone and the old tablet this is replacing, it's unflappable even when playing games.  It hasn't gotten more than \"perceptibly warmer than ambient\" so far while browsing Google Earth in 3D mode.\n\n* Ergonomics are good.  The rubberized speaker grilles make a good resting point for fingers when holding it in landscape mode, which is probably where a tablet like this will spend most of its time.  It's light enough that holding it by the thin bezels in portrait mode isn't too taxing on my hand muscles.\n\n* It already had Marshmallow when I booted it up.  No OTA necessary except for a recently (as of November 2016) security patch.\n\n* It has bloatware, but not much of it.  A game and a handful of Nvidia apps are uninstallable but it's not totally loaded down with crud.  With the optional stylus, some apps like the note taker and drawing app seem to be genuinely useful.\n\n* Battery life has been promising so far.  My use case involves two or three 15-30 minute sessions a day, plus a few hours of streaming video and radio here and there.  So far, I'm getting 1.5 to 2.0 complete days out of the battery, which is not too shabby considering I have not yet disabled any apps or shut down any syncing.  (It's a far cry from my old Acer's 2-5 DAY battery life with this same usage pattern, but it was a much bigger tablet with a much bigger battery.)\n\n* Processing appears to be adequate for now.  No real lag that I can see, no major hiccups even when loading the full Facebook page in Opera browser.  I can't imagine it will be this smooth for long, as apps are constantly finding new ways to tax older processors.  But for now, and for most games, it seems more than adequate.\n\nNegatives:\n\n* Occasional issues with touch sensitivity have cropped up.  Sometimes when opening the (aftermarket) cover, the tablet comes on and an app has been running in the background; it appears the tablet cover is causing a touch response at random at some point.  And occasionally it just fails to register a touch at all when tapping app icons or links in the browser.  For whatever reason, this does not seem to happen when using the on screen nav buttons or the pull down notification shade.\n\n* Streaming radio/music quits if the screen goes off for more than a minute or two.  I dunno if this an Android issue or the way Nvidia optimized the system, but if I put on AccuRadio or Amazon Music and try streaming, it'll play until the screen is cut off, then 2-5 minutes more, then nothing.  As soon as the screen is powered back on, it resumes immediately.  I wish there was a way around this as my phone does not suffer this issue.\n\n* Screen quality isn't quite as good as I was hoping for.  Considering its selling point as a game machine, I was hoping for a crisper, clearer display.  I basically cannot tell any real difference between 720p and 1080p streams on YouTube, and only a bare difference between 480p and 720p.  Whereas on my phone with it's much smaller screen, it's a much more obvious difference.  (The phone also handles 1440p videos, which is yet another noticeable step better.)  On the plus side, there does not appear to be any real issue with white balance or any of the issues with oversaturation one finds on AMOLED type screens.  The colors seem just right all around.\n\n* Accessing the SD card is quite difficult.  The SD card needs to be pushed a wee bit further in than is easy to do with fat fingers It's quite recessed behind the little plastic door that hides the opening.  Of course, most folks will set it and forget it, but if you swap cards regularly and have larger hands it may be an issue.  I use the edge of an dime to pop the card out of the slot.  When I first tried to clamp the little cover back in place, it would not sit flush.  For several days, I'd assumed I'd broken it because it sprung out slightly on one end and looked wrong.  But it turns out it wasn't broke, it just need a really firm press to latch it back into place completely.\n\nSome other things that are neither positive nor negative:  Button placement.  The power button is quite close to the upper right side edge and I've hit it accidentally a few times while picking the device up.  Having a case helps, but isn't a total solution.  Power and volume don't really have a lot of tactile feedback, either.  The cameras.  Not bad, but not great.  Tablets rarely seem to have good cameras, though, so it's not a huge deal.  The OEM camera app has several features built in like a few special effects and HDR processing, but they are nothing special.  Updates.  No telling if this will get any more OS updates, or even any more security updates.  It's been on the market for a while and there seems to be little indication that Nvidia will ever move it up to Nougat or newer.  But Marshmallow is not a bad version of Android (my lone complaint is the wifi indicator no longer has graphics indicating data is being transferred) and will serve the device well through its expected life expectancy.\n\nIn conclusion, it's not a perfect device, but what is?  For the price, it's a great balance between affordability and performance, especially if you're a gamer.  I'm not, so some of the GPU tech is no doubt wasted on me, but for streaming video and reading books it's a pretty viable option if you're in the market for an 8\" tablet.\n\nUpdate: I bought the tablet in November 2016, and now it's nearly one year later.  It's still chugging along quite nicely.  The tablet has received several security updates since purchasing AND has gotten a much appreciated OS update to Android 7.  It's unknown how much further this thing will go before Nvidia drops all support, but thus far (minor upgrade bugs aside) it's been a pretty positive experience with the Nvidia people as far as getting upgrades and being able to give feedback to issues that have cropped up."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0171BS9CG", "review": "Nice tablet and great value. I have had both a 7\" and 10\" Nexus. I found the 7\" too small and the 10\" a tad too large. I decided to try this 8\" tablet. I think a 9\" tab may be the sweet spot, but this one is really close to ideal. The Nvidia looks and works well. The only minor issue is the touch screen. I think it's a bit too sensitive such that I often get unintentional touch actuations. My only negative in performance is that it takes some number of seconds (10 - 20) to really become responsive after waking up. If I patiently give it those seconds before doing much on the screen it becomes very responsive. I equipped it with a 64GB microSD card and let the OS mount it as extended memory. This works like a charm. You really can't beat the value for an 8\" high performance tablet."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0171BS9CG", "review": "I had a ipad mini retina display (ipad mini 2) and had cracked the screen. i didn't bother to fix it so I decided to by a new tablet. I was looking for something that was not that expensive and had more than decent specs. Nvidia shield tablet has one of the best processors out there for gaming and so i decided to give it a try. I haven't experience any lag as what you would expect from an android tablet. the downside of the tablet it is the screen resolution coming from a retina display to the shied you notice a big difference but for the money is what you can expect. Hopefully they decide to make another version with amoled display with 2k resolution. If they do that it would be a killing tablet."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0171BS9CG", "review": "I researched a lot when looking for a tablet that would be powerful, small, and not break the bank. This tablet delievers. It's been on the market for a while so if there was a knock on it I would say it's time for an update. However, if you look at other tablets on the market in the same price point this tablet still shines over the others. I won't get into the specs of the tablet, you can look them up easily on the page descriptions. This review is more about practical everyday use.\n\nDesign:\nI really like the design of this tablet. It is a clean design with some thougth put into everyday use. The 9inch display is perfect for portability and yet provides plenty of usable space to make for a well rounded tablet for gaming, productivity, and entertainment. It's great having front facing speakers when you have a device that is made for gaming and entertainment, plus the have a rubber coating over the speaker grills that make for a better grib and feel. There are people that have complained about the buttons not being defined enough and hard to press, that hasn't been my experience and they do help prevent the accidental press when using. Really the only complaint that I would have is it is not a very light or thin tablet. Again I think that speaks to the age of the device a new version should fix that but overall I'm impressed.\n\nScreen:\nThis is a very nice screen when it comes to clarity and color. Again 9inches hits a sweet spot for me allowing for multifunction and overall a good experience. My only comment here is I do wish the brightness was a little better. Compared to other displays it lakes at times. However, again looking at comparable devices in this price point and this device is still ahead of them all. Also, this isn't really screen related but the fact that the tablet has a mini HDMI that is seperate from the usb port is awesome for gaming. You can use a mini HDMI to standard HDMI and plug the table into a TV and have a huge display. Awesome for gaming, I even use it when I'm working. Because its seperate it allows you to keep the device charged while it's plugged into the TV which jsut makes sense.\n\nPerformance:\nWhile this is an older chipset it holds it's own with gaming and entertainment. I've been impressed on the gaming side thanks to the K1 processor it runs games super smooth and provides an overall great experience. There are times that the device will lag a bit when multitasking but still handles any app or game that I have tried to play on the device. The shield software that comes with this device makes it awesome for gaming. I don't think I have come across another tablet that has the ability to play the titles that this does. It beats anything out there including Apple. Again I use this tablet for more than just gaming and have had no problems with any app that I've used. When I'm working I connect this to a keyboard and mouse and it really turns this device into something special. Downside right now for productivity is the fact that there is not multi-window support so multitasking is limited. Hopefully that will be addressed in future software updates. Samsung can do it so hopefully Android and Nvidia will get on board too.\n\nBattery Life:\nOne of the areas that I think NVIDIA did to to cut cost and is a bit of a disappointment is the battery. It's not large and when you are talking about a device that is designed with gaming in mind it leaves me wanting more. Depending on the game I can drain the battery within a couple of hours (usually with heavy gaming around 3-4hrs). Now, when I'm not doing heavy gaming the battery and software performs well. On average I can go a full day on a single charge with watching some Youtube, emailing, light gaming, web browsing. I still feel however that I have to keep an eye on it so that my battery lasts the day.\n\nStorage:\nAnother compromise when it comes to this device is storage. 12gigs of internal storage is the bare minumum when it comes to usable internal storage. When talking about a gaming device that isn't enough. NVIDIA has gotten creative with allowing you to format an SD card to expand the memory however it is a bit buggy. The times that I used it I found unreliable. The card would sometimes not show it was inserted so the apps that were running on the sd card were not available and the tablet seem to lag and freeze more frequently in this mode. Now different memory cards I think could improve this performance but I just don't trust it enough to use consistently. Also, when you use the memory card in this method you can't remove and use like a regular memory card. For me that was the deal breaker. I like to be able to transfer movie files to the card using the card reader rather than usb connection (faster). Can't do that when it's set up as part of the internal memory.\n\nOverall:\nAgain for the price what you get in this small package is great. I look forward to the next version of this. NVIDIA gets how to make a solid tablet that is a great value. I would highly recommend this tablet."}

Sometimes the main lock screen won't respond for several minutes, sometimes it rotates the screen out of no where, going a direction it is in no way facing - sometimes it even locks itself in the wrong direction and an app or restart is all that can fix it. It's good enough that when it's happy, it will play games, videos, etc and honestly quite well.. But I really don't know what bogs my tablet down. Same symptoms after basic resets, and a factory reset, for the record.\n\nStill a pretty good deal for the price, and I use it every day so it's not like it's a failure altogether, just not a very smooth experience."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0171BS9CG", "review": "I have two Nvidia Shield K1 tablets. With them, I also purchased the 128gb Sandisk Extreme microSD card and the 128gb Samsung Select Pro microSD card to use with these two tablets. After using the \"format as internal\" option on the tablet to be able to store my apps on to these microSD cards, both of my tablet start going into an endless cycle of reboots if I turn them on after they had been powered off.  All I have are just 5gbs of apps from the google play store. Now once I take out the Sandisk and the Samsung microSD cards, both the tablets restart on their own and then return to  perfect working order.  The latest update, which is the \"Shield Tablet Software Version 1.5\" was suppose to fix the cycle of reboots with  microSD cards but it did NOT a thing. Neither did a hard reset (three times) . I do have a 64gb Samsung Evo+ microSD card and that works perfectly. I just need more space.\n\nLong story short, Nvidia needs to update a software fix for this cycle of reboots. Using a 128gb microSD card should be as simple as plug and play. As for these 2 tablets, I really wanted to keep them but will be returning them back to Amazon."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0171BS9CG", "review": "I really want to like the Shield. The screen is very clear and the speakers are above average from the other tablets I have used in the past. Unfortunately there are 3 major issues that have turned my experience with this tablet more often than not a practice in patience.\n\nThe first issue is a two part issue with charging the Shield. The device always claims to be charging even when not plugged in. I had this part start after about 2 days of use. By itself this would be fairly minor if annoying, but the tablet also has had several instances where even when plugged in it just does not charge. Because of this whenever I want to charge it I have to check the battery percentage, plug it in, wait a few minutes, and then make sure that the percentage has actually gone up.\n\nThe second  issue in with the wireless connection. For me the Wifi on this thing either works perfectly or not at all. I have never had a device before that completely lost signal for minutes at a time without moving at all.\n\nThe third issue is some strange issues with the touchscreen. Maybe ever other day or so the touchscreen will act as if a random part of the screen  is being held. It mostly shows up under heavy touchscreen use, but did happen once when it was sitting on my desk untouched. The only fix that I have found so far is to restart the Tablet. Between this and the Wifi issues, my tablet has mostly turned into portable movie player."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0171BS9CG", "review": "This is a great tablet at a fantastic price. It's so powerful, I haven't been able to find a single app that actually slows it down - although some can cause it to run a bit hot. The screen is pretty nice; I haven't noticed any problems with it. Build quality is good; the design is elegant, understated and comfy in the hands, unlike some flashy \"gaming tablets\" by manufacturers who shall not be named here. ;)\nThe lack of physical Back/Home/Tasks buttons is an occasional minus, but not a showstopper. In particular, if you're doing a lot of intense gaming, physical buttons for Back/Home/Tasks could actually be problematic if pressed accidentally, so the fact that the Shield doesn't have them could even be considered a plus. The interface for bringing up those buttons is standard and fairly smooth.\nBundled apps are kind of meh - in particular, the drawing app is an exercise in frustration - but who buys a tablet for the bundled apps anyway? Especially with this device, choosing and customizing your own suite of apps and peripherals is half the fun.\nSpeaking of peripherals, I did experience quite a bit of difficulty trying to pair a Sony Dual Shock 4 controller to the tablet over Bluetooth. However, a $4 OTG adapter was all it took to solve that problem (you can reuse your charging cable as a controller cable), and now I'm happily gaming on the go. Your mileage may vary if you really need a wireless controller though - or if you want to charge the tablet while playing with the controller.\nIn conclusion, I can't imagine a better tablet being sold at this price anytime within the next year or so. There are a few rough spots, but not enough to even warrant knocking off half a star in my opinion. If you're looking for a slick, pre-packaged, super-convenient experience and don't mind paying a lot more, then maybe you might want to look elsewhere. But for me, it's perfect."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0171BS9CG", "review": "Okay............I bought this tablet for one purpose mainly and that is to have FPV with my drones.  That said I have loaded my appware and software needed to run diagnostics; keep track of flights; maintenance; and records.  The Shield is pleasantly thin for my needs and the screen very vivid and ample sized.  It is a 8\" diagonal screen and not a side to side 8\" screen for those like me who want to know prior to buying.  The system is very quick as far as the processor is concerned and I utilize a Sony cell phone charging connector as my source to charge and it works fine.  I also ordered a rubberized Poetic cover which is yet to arrive but I am sure it will fit the bill for me.  Now to the bad.  I am not a gamer which this tablet was intended so I cannot comment on gaming folks, sorry.  What I do dislike and why it received only 4 stars is two things for me........1) A fairly weak WiFi signal pickup ability.  To those wondering what I am referring to.  My back deck is where I will start some drone missions which is about 45 feet direct line through my house from the office where the router is located.  And from that I get a broken signal!  Now mind you everything else I have had whether cell phone or tablet has had no issue what so ever picking up at that distance.  So to remedy this I had a signal booster by Netgear I placed in my kitchen to catch the WiFi signal to send another 10-15 feet or so to my back deck which is off the kitchen.  Now I get a signal.  To me that is a very weak signal the Shield can receive for sure.  And this was a \"con\" from all the reviews I read but I figured I could work around this anomaly and have so far.  Now to dislike 2) The power button is almost impossible to find easily with feel and is not pronounced enough by my like to easily manipulate for a on/off execution.  Not sure why they made it so small and almost non-existent but they did.  The volume up/down is literally right below it which I had rather it be spaced a bit more or on the other side of the tablet.  So the skivvy is this...............for my use that is, it works and has great graphics and a screen that is very vivid.  The system is very quick and responsive unlike my Verizon Elippsis tablet which can be a bit sluggish or time lapse.  Oh, I forgot to mention.....better buy a SD card for this tablet as well.  Only 16GB memory installed and quite honestly I cannot think why they did not have it at 32GB at least.  But it will handle a 64GB micro SD card which I have purchased that should give me ample storage capability since I do not plan to load it up but with only necessities for my drone program.  If the tablet had much better WiFi pickup and addressed the button issues then this tablet for my need would be a perfect 5.0!  Enjoy and well worth the $199 on average this tablet brings in.  I included some screen shots but apologize for they were taken with a cell phone.  Did not have the time to take out the Canon Rebel to shoot great pics!"}

So I picked it up. First couple of days no problem. Then the auto rotate function wouldn't work. Did some research and downloaded an app to calibrate the gps on it. That seemed to work. For a while. Within a few days the auto rotate issue was back. Doing research on this issue I found out that this is a known problem with this tablet.\n\nI also found the tab very laggy and buggy. Screen would freeze. Often when I hit the power button to wake the tab up nothing would happen. Had to hit the button numerous times or reboot to get it to come on. Not cool on a tab that was only a few days old. I ended up returning it. Too many hassles and issues for a tab that wasn't even a week old.\n\nI ended up getting the Asus zenpad S 8.0  Like night and day. That tab is smooth as silk with no issues, no lag, nothing. I love it. There must be a reason that Google had Asus make the Nexus 7 for them. I really really wanted the Shield to work out but it didn't."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0171BS9CG", "review": "I purchased the Shield K1 after a month of reading about various tablets, comparing specs, and watching several reviews. I have owned Samsung tablets, iPads, and Kindle tablets. I am a bit of a techie and research nut. When researching a new tablet I was looking for something that was fast and had above average graphics running either Android or iOS.  It had to be new enough to be able to upgrade to the latest version of either OS and big enough to use for reading on the Kindle App for my graduate class textbooks. I was prepared to spend about $350-400 on a tablet, but wouldn't pay the top end of that range if something in a lower price range checked all the boxes. Well, the Shield K1 definitely checked all the boxes. I have had this tablet for more than a week now and just finished my first paper after reading a popular Jim Collins book on the device. It was exactly what I needed for that purpose (my primary need) and also does well with general Internet surfing. It is fast and responsive and the 8\" size is perfect for reading articles online or streaming videos. Reviewers have said that the display isn't as sharp as they'd like, but it isn't that far behind anything else I have used, as videos/pictures still look sharp. Again, that wasn't a priority for me when looking for a tablet. I also like the built in speakers for watching video. I'm not going to tell you this is the best tablet you can buy, because it is not. But, it is exactly what I needed and is definitely worthy of five stars by any comparison."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0171BS9CG", "review": "***Updated 12/24/16***\nThis is my 5th Android tablet.  In the past I've owned Archos, Samsung, ASUS, and the Kindle Fire tablets.  I've also used an iPad 2 for work extensively.  I've been using the Fire for the past 18 months, but finally grew tired of not having access to Google apps and the Play store.  I debated switching to the Apple iPad Mini 4, but just couldn't get myself to spend $400 on a tablet.  This review is after nearly 3 months of ownership.\n\nFirst, there are a couple of misleading items on the Amazon product page for this tablet.  It comes with Android 6.0.1 installed.  The product page still says Android 5.  Some prior reviewers had battery issues with the Android 6 upgrade.  I have NOT seen battery drain issues on mine.\n\nSecond, the tablet does not come with the cover/stand that allows you to prop it up on a table.  This is shown in one of the pictures.\n\nPros:\n1.  This tablet is FAST!  By far, this is the most responsive/snappy tablet I've used.  Switching between apps, touch screen response, app performance, etc.  It's all good.\n2.  It's lighter and thinner than I expected.  While still thicker than the iPad, it's thinner than the Kindle Fire that I was using.\n3.  Gaming performance is unmatched.  I don't plan to game much on the tablet.  But given this tablet was designed for gaming, I loaded up a few games to try.  There are actually real FPS games available and they actually work well on the tablet.\n4.  Wifi works great.  Some prior reviewers reported issues.  I've had nearly full bars on mine.\n5.  The HDMI to TV works really well, but only certain apps support it.  Don't plan to use any app through the HDMI.\n\nCons:\n1.  There's something flaky about the browser rendering engine.  Maybe it's an Android 6 issue.  But when I go to news.google.com, none of the articles display in Chrome.  I installed the Opera browser and had the same issue.  Then I installed the Firefox browser and it worked.  I noticed the Firefox browser was displaying the 'full desktop version' of that web site.  So I went back to Chrome and clicked the 'request desktop site' option and the page displayed fine.  All I can conclude is the Android HTML rendering engine is flaky, or maybe it's an issue specific to Nvida.\n2. Battery life is not as good as other tablets I've owned.  I can watch a full length movie through the HDMI port to my TV and it'll only consume about 25% of the battery life.  But I can leave it sitting on my night stand overnight while not in use, and it'll still consume 25%.  Maybe I need to adjust the settings in Android to improve the sleep battery life.\n3. The screen flakes-out at times.  I've had to restart the tablet several times.  It just becomes unresponsive or really laggy at times. If it wasn't for this, I'd rate this a 5 star tablet.  But this is frustrating.\n\nWhat I haven't tried:\n1. I have not tried using the HDMI connector to a TV.\n2. I haven't used a game controller when playing games."}

I can play games for maybe 1 hr before battery is dead, you can have it plugged in and charging and it will loose life as your charging it even if your using software that is not heavy on power , it ghost clicks when your finger are no where near touching it. It grabs touched objects and moves them way off from where you are touching it, it locks up sometime for no reason , it has major issues with wi fi , the sides are already showing bulging and coming apart along with all the rubber finger grippy things on the side , the power button is extremely hard to get to work or push , the sound button sometime goes loud or off when pushing it correctly , it will do the opposite. It does play top end games nicely so far for me but the heat it creates after 10 minutes or less is unbearable, it has issues finding and keeping the controller running I have to reset it all the time. I now use it only as a small app player when i am in the bathroom doing my business and to use as a calendar event reminder when i am on the road. I bought this thinking that i could stream my desk comp pc games to it but never could get that to work at all. over all i can not recommend this for gaming at all. i have ipads and a nook i use and both of them run far better at all things then this brick. i love NVidia video cards and GeForce exp and never had issues with any of those other then some driver issues and would recommend anything from that category but this thing they call a tablet is full of issues and should never have been allowed for sale to the public till it was working. Anyways that's my rant, i know the trolls will flame me for this but it is what it is. I would have payed 1k or more for a working tablet that could play top end games and stream without any issues but till then i am stuck with this thing. thinking about just buy a surface pro 4 but don't really want something that large to carry around.\n Sorry for the wall of text\n Thank you for your time hope it helps if your considering buying one."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0171BS9CG", "review": "I initially purchased the Shield as a low budget laptop replacement. It performs virtually flawlessly and is one of the best (if not the best) price for value in the tablet market today.\n\nProcessing Power (5/5) - For note taking, uploading/downloading, word processing, web search the Shield performs just as well as any Mac or Windows PC. Android runs flawlessly with the Tegra K1 running the device. Android apps load instantly and games play extremely smoothly (Asphalt 8 and Google Earth run with virtually zero lag). NVIDIA has had some experience in pushing performance to the limit, and in this tablet it shows.\n\nHardware (4/5) - The NVIDIA Shield K1 does not come with a charger or stylus. This was to keep the price at $200. Its up to you wether you think this was a good idea, but since the NVIDIA Stylus alone goes for around $40 and everyone has a mini usb charger at this point I like the buget route they went. One of my favorite hardware features are not only one but TWO FRONT FACING SPEAKERS. The tablet can play almost as loud as a portable bluetooth speaker and sounds exceptional. For gaming and video watching these features really add to the experience. The only piece of hardware I felt didn't live up to the quality of the rest of the build was the camera. I don't personally take pictures with my tablet so this wasn't a big deal to me, but to some people it is. The camera is not bad but can look slightly grainy and tinted in certain light levels.\n\nWorth (5/5) - This tablet is easily worth more than $200. You won't be able to find one close to the quality for the price. I have gotten a lot of use out of mine and it runs smoothly. With new software updates consistently being introduced the tablet only gets better."}

It can power off on you when you least expect it, and that is extremely annoying.\n\nDownloading updates takes forever. First, you have to update the app in the google play store. This usually doesn't take very long. However, you have to open the app and download the update again. Then you have to \"extract resources.\" This part takes forever, much longer than on my iPad 2.\n\nThe touchscreen is unreliable. Sometimes it is very sensitive, but sometimes it is extremely unresponsive. I click on a button and it doesn't respond at all.\n\nThe battery life is very short. I have to plug it into the charger while playing a game.\n\nApps crash much more than on my previous tablet, an iPad 2 with iOS 7.

Performance is amazing, battery life is good, it's sturdy, and NVIDIA has been quick with the updates.  It would have merited a 5-star review if it weren't for one problem.  The WiFi is completely useless.  When all your other devices have full signal strength, the Shield will have almost none.  Leave it sitting right next to an AP with a continuous ping running, and it'll work for a few minutes, then stop for a few minutes, then work for a few minutes, then stop for a few minutes, etc.  I kept the tablet initially thinking that it would probably be fixed with a software update (it was running Marshmallow, which was brand new at the time).  Unfortunately, many updates have since come and gone, with no improvement.  Hours of research and experimenting have accomplished nothing.  At this point, I'm ready to toss it and buy something else.  My recommendation is to avoid this.  A tablet without WiFi is worthless."}

It is being marketed as a gaming tablet but I'm not a gamer so can't speak to that.  I do know it is amazing, speedy, great optics, and all around fabulous tablet."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0171BS9CG", "review": "I love, LOVE this tablet. Been using Tegras for some time now, previously owned a Tegra 3 and Tegra 4 tablet. This thing is an animal and can run anything you throw at it. I emulate a ton, and it's been great even for emulating PSP and Dreamcast titles, very powerful. Also great form factor for reading, 16:10 gives you a bit more side room when reading in portrait mode, unlike the usual 16:9 form factors. Fine for video as well.\n\nI could sing praises of this thing all day.\n\n============================\n\nOriginal review was in August 2016. This is an update from January 2017:\n\nI had to RMA my original Shield K1 for a screen defect. There was some minor light bleed in one corner initially, but so minor it was ignorable. Well, it got worse, until the light bleed was in all four corners and the left side of the screen shimmered when pressed. Went defective, doh.\n\nFortunately, Nvidia support was fantastic every step of the way. I contacted them via their online chat, sent a picture of the issue, they immediately approved RMA and emailed me a printable shipping label next day to send it RMA, at no cost to me for shipping or return shipping. All told, I was without my tablet for about 10 days, but the refurb I received has no defects to speak of. Screen looks great and so far no issues.\n\nStill leaving the review at 5 stars since the tablet does everything I need exceptionally well, and Nvidia went above and beyond in quickly making the problem right. But I feel it's fair to append this to the review so people are aware these could potentially have issues."}

WoT Blitz runs on max settings at a buttery smooth 60fps.\nHolds a charge nicely\nSound is good\nHDMI out if you need it\nVery attractive price\n\nCons:\nCamera is lackluster. 5 MP front and back. My 1+1 has a 13 MP. This just feels so lacking.\nPretty slow. especially after not opening it for a while. Cleaner app is a must for freeing the small amount of RAM.\nNo notification light\nNo gallery by default\nScreen is TOO responsive. I find any cables that accidentally bump the screen will act like a touch, which gets very annoying.\nA bit buggy. Whether it's the system or the OS, I don't know. Constantly getting \"Play services have stopped\" or the photos I take just disappearing because it doesn't know where to send them?\n\nPersonal quips:\nThe power button is way too high up, making it uncomfortable to reach. And I have big hands\n\nTo be completely honest I do regret buying this. It's pretty unnecessary for what I need, as it was a replacement my old MacBookPro that died. I didn't expect much from it, but where I did expect something (Camera, notification light, speed) it's a let down. Guess I've been spoiled by the 1 + series"}

I broke the screen on my tablet (my fault) and reached out to Nvidia. The tablet is still under warranty, so I'm waiting to hear if they'll consider repairing it. I'm happy to pay for the repair or replacement part. I'm unhappy that they don't actually offer a repair service directly or through a partner. I guess the trade-off for a good price is buying a product that is essentially disposable. If I could do it over, I'd pay more for something repairable. **\n\nThis is my second tablet.

I'm impressed with the build quality, and choice of materials used in making this tablet - it doesn't feel cheap and plastic-y like my previous Acer Iconia 8 did. The color and resolution of the screen is hard to beat, but the short-ish battery life does leave a little bit to be desired. For my purposes, however, it is more than sufficient and being able to stream games from my PC anywhere on the go is a huge plus as well. The only reason this doesn't get five stars is because of the battery life, but that's pretty much to be expected with such a high performance device."}

I can do all of my normal Droid functions as well.  Another positive for the K1 is that it does not have a ton of bloatware on it, so no useless apps I don't care for taking up space, mem or cpu cycles.\n\nThe only issue I have seen is that some times it does get a little laggy/sluggish with multiple apps open, but I either close a few apps or restart the device and it solves those issues, but to be clear I never have those issues when im gaming, its usually when I am switching between several apps at once.\n\nI don't think you can find a comparable tablet/device in this price range that can compete on a features or functionality level."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0171BS9CG", "review": "I've had this tablet for about a month now and I'm quite pleased with it. I use it for reading pdfs; web browsing; and playing games like pokemon tcgo, hearthstone and other tablet designed games. I got this tablet because I wanted something that was similar to my phone (oneplus2) but with a larger screen. My only complaints are the battery life, charging, and the aftermarket case I got for it. I often find that the charge percentage will drop while I'm charging the tablet if I'm using it for anything other than browsing the web. For example if I'm watching netflix with the tablet plugged in the charge level will slowlh drop. And I have verified that the charger and cable I'm using are pushing 2.1 amps. I would prefer this tablet used USB-C instead of micro usb. As for the feel of the tablet it may be worth it to get the nvidia brand case. I use a 3rd party case and I often find myself taking it out of the case. The device itself is the perfect weight and shape and feels great using it without the case. Having the case is convenient when I want to prop the tablet up and offers a fair amout of protection. The reason I'm suggesting getting the nvidia case for this tablet is because it appears to snap on and off fairly easily as opposed to the  3rd party case which the tablet doesn't snap in and out of as easily."}

This tablet features many ways to customize it for your gaming needs, or just for general day to day use. Battery life on this tablet isn't the greatest, but I'm not complaining. The front facing speakers are clear and crisp, providing some of the best sounds you could ever get out of a tablet.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0171BS9CG", "review": "Two months after buying it my conclusion is: Worth every penny!\n\nThings I love in the hardware:\n-The HDMI out port\n-Front facing speakers which are hard to obturate because you also have left and right \"sound exits\", they are not specially loud but is enough for personal use\n-Screen is absolutely beautiful (1920 x 1200) is just the right resolution for this screen, vibrant colors, great contrast and incredible brightness levels (you can actually use this thing at completely darkness because the lowest brightness level is incredible low) from almost screen off to \"you can use this thing on a sunny day on the beach\" level\n-Rear/Front cameras, are actually pretty good! 5MP HDR is enough for most common situations (considering this is a tablet and not a phone), for skype calls and scanning documents is actually pretty nice.\n\nThings I hate in the hardware:\n-Power and Volume buttons, some times you have to make sure you are pressing the power button or press it twice, you don't feel like every time you press the button it will respond, Volume buttons are a little better but not that much. I think the could do a better job on these. If you buy the nvidia cover or any other magnetic cover, the power button issue may disappear as the magnetic cover will power on or off the screen, but you wil have to live with the volume button.\n\nThings I love in the software;\n-So many options in settings, things like 4K output in the HDMI, game/app optimization (yes, individually optimized)\n-It is 95% android stock software, the nvidia apps really add value to the product. Also the 2 android updates that I have experienced (6.0 and 6.0.1) were delivered almost immediately by nvidia\n-The console mode is a really great functionality.\n-The clock/alarm built in app is awesome (not kidding)\n\nThere are other good ideas that I don't really use but are good to have, like:\n-Dabbler application, it is pre loaded with some amazing drawings, unfortunately I am not a Pro drawer but some people will find that app useful.\n-Squid is pre-loaded with the tablet, it is basically an app to take notes using the stylus, you can indicate the tablet the input method so there is no issues if any other part of your hand touches the screen (take that ipad pro!), the same functionality is present for Dabbler.\n\nThings I hate in the software:\n-Nothing at all, everything is at the right place\n\nThings to consider before buy it:\n\n-BUY A MORE THAN GOOD MICRO SD CARD, UHS-3 AT LEAST, if you are planning on downloading a lot of stuff or planning on install a lot of games in the SD, get a good one otherwise you might find issues.\n\n-If you want it for gaming: controller is a must have, you can use other controllers (like DS4 or xbox 360 via OTG cable) but you will get the best experience in all nvidia controller supported apps with the nvidia controller, more later.\n\n-If you want it for consume content: mini HDMI to HDMI cable is a must have (the one from Amazon basics is very good), eventually you will feel the need to use the HDMI port\n\n-If you want it for productivity: Get the nvidia stylus, the only con is that there is no place to store it inside the tablet or the case, but the stylus will enrich almost any productivity task like taking notes, drawing things (like diagrams or pro drawings).\n\n-If you want it for all of the above, consider at least 100 extra dollars to invest, basically controller, hdmi cable and UHS-3 sd card, I don't see the official cover worth its 40 USD, at the end you might end purchasing it or any other un-official cover, but I think the cover is up to you, since it does not deliver any major functionality than cover the front screen and hold the tablet in a good angle. Nvidia Stylus is also expensive, you might find other cheaper options, but don't expect them to work exactly the same.\n\nThings that you might be wondering right now:\n-Battery life? No worries, worst case scenario you will need to charge it overnight in a daily basis, if you use the tablet for heavy gaming or hardcore video streaming in a daily basis.\n-Nvidia PC GameStream? Works smoothly as long as you have a 5ghz router and an nvidia supported graphics card (Desktop GTX600 or higher, Notebook GTX 660M, 670MX, 675MX, 680M, 700M or higher).\n-Nvidia GeForce Now? What the hell is this? Cloud gaming basically, you have a liittle spot in a nvidia server to run games in the cloud (yes you don't need a gaming class pc), first 3 months are free by purchasing nvidia shield then with 7.99 per month, you can play free games like Saints Row 4, Grid Auto Sport and other Paid games like The witcher 3. As long as you have a reliable internet connection (at least 12MB downstream, 5MB upstream) and preferably the nvidia controller, you are good to go. It is a good option if you don't have a gaming pc or you don't want to pay the maintenance cost of having one (replacements, electricity, etc).\n\nConclusion: This tablet is awesome for almost anyone, summarizing:\nIf this is your first tablet and you are scared of paying a lot of money for something you don't know how much you will use, get the Nvidia K1.\nIf you don't have a a smart tv, get the Nvidia K1 and the hdmi cable.\nIf you don't have a gaming PC but are planning on getting one but you wanna try how it is before, get the Nvidia K1 and try the geforce now.\nIf you have kids who wanna play games or watch movies and don't want to invest a lot of money in other options, get the Nvidia K1.\nIf you are most of the times \"on the go\" and don't have some much time to play in the commodity of your couch/chair watching your tv/monitor, definitely this is for you!\n\nEven if you have a PS4 you can use the remote play APK (I got it from xda forum, just google it) and it works!!!\n\nFor me this is a very honest product, you pay for what you want.\nIf you are a gaming guy this thing will fulfill almost all of your needs, no matter if you don't have a gaming pc, if you actually have it, if you have a PS4 (sorry xbox owners!) or if you don't, you get this, you'll game, that's it, more honest impossible."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0171BS9CG", "review": "It is like they don't want you to use GeForce Now.  You will find no indication of how to sign up on line, and no indication will appear until you update Nvidia Hub on Google Play.  Don't do the OTA update or you will brick your tablet.  The only way to find out that info is to call their Indian tech support.  They will put you on hold.  Once you update, your Nvidia controller won't work.  You will find no indication of why it doesn't work, until after much research, you will realize that the controller needs to be charged first, unlike the tablet.  The buttons you are supposed to press are ambiguous at best according to the directions, and they provide no tactile feedback that they are actually being pressed.  Then, if you are lucky enough to find the GeForce Now signup, you will be asked for your credit card info, and told that you are being charged for the first three \"free\" months.  Please, Nvidia, get someone who understands english to rework this mess of an onboarding process.  THIS is why you are losing."}

I've owned the Nexus 9 which had the same processor, but it wasn't optimized the same as the Shield K1 is. I did have a problem with using an micro SD card as internal storage - it caused the tablet to act very sluggish and apps would lock up/force close. Once I formatted the card to be used as external storage, all my issues were gone."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0171BS9CG", "review": "I've owned a few Android tablets.  Notably an ASUS Transformer and a Dell Venue 8.  I delayed replacing the Venue even though its Intel based system caused lots of application incompatibility.  I was waiting for the follow-on to the Shield K1 but finally the Venue failed (memory problem) so I felt \"forced\" to get the K1.  What a mistake it was...to have waited that long!  I could have had a 8 inch tablet with great compatibility and performance for all those months that I dealt with the old tablet.  Amazon shipped the tablet quickly, the update to Android 6 was immediately available for download and installation, and the K1 is not loaded with bloatware.\n\nPros:  Quick, lag free performance\n  Every app I've tried works properly\n  Runs current version of Android\n  Screen is clear and detailed-1920 x 1200 resolution on an 8\" display\n  HDMI output works great with my TV\n  Bluetooth functions well\n  Excellent value\n\nSo-so:  No power supply included, just a USB cable (pretty cheap)\n  Wi-fi range is only fair\n  Sound is \"OK\" through built-in speakers but for serious listening use something external\n  Battery life is OK but I believe other, lower powered, tablets offer better battery life.\n  Tablet appearance is pretty basic--lacks \"curb appeal\" of IPad or other more expensive tablets\n\nCons: Power switch doesn't have a positive action\n  Needs optional controller (which I don't have) for a real Android game playing experience"}

HOWEVER, they are always updating and fixing everything faster than other tablets I have had. before this I had a Samsung Galaxy, which I gave to my kids once I realized how much I seriously love this tablet. Its rugged, the front speakers are awesome. I love the features and the customizability of this tablet. its unique but simple to get into it and make it your own, It runs things great, streaming shows looks amazing on it, and the screen I am happy to say has never had a protector on it and still looks like the day I bought it!!! I love the feel of it in my hands, not too light that it feels cheap and not too heavy that you cant read on without hand cramps. I will be looking into more of NVIDIA's products because I am so impressed on how they keep up with their tech and support their products consistently. The price is what is the icing on the cake. This is a very decent price for  what I would say is far better than the more expensive alternatives!!!"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0171BS9CG", "review": "The tablet for games is pretty powerful. I haven't had any issues with it running any game really well and some are enhanced specifically for the shield which are great but few. Really nice touch sensitivity and lots of things you can tweak out if you dig, including changing the power setting for when you're not gaming to extend battery life which is OK, not great but not horrible.\n\nIt's not as sharp as the Samsung Galaxy Tablet (slightly lower resolution and less ppi) but still a nice screen and people who have a hard time reading tiny text on a high res screen will actually appreciate it.\n\nI've had no problem with the memory card which is a 128gb card. The problem you may have is that not all SD cards are equal by any stretch of the imagination. If you want it to work, get a good card designed with fast transfer rates and it should work fine. I've tried cheaper SDs and they always fail and give issues.\n\nMy only complaint is a common one. The WiFi isn't great. In fact it sucks. It constantly looses connections which if you're watching videos on youtube, netflix, etc., this is a royal pain. It's gotten better with some of the updates, but it still exists unfortunately. Usually restarting it helps a lot and I've heard a few people who never had the problem. I'm not one of them unfortunately. If it weren't for this, I would give it 5 stars and if it were my only tablet and I'm not playing games a lot. I would get something else. I personally use it for games and testing games I make using the unreal engine which is Super easy to use with this tablet and works really well with it.\n\nAll in all, a good gaming tablet with very little clutter and lots of options in the settings but really bad at consistent wifi connections. Sometimes it works mostly it stutters. If they ever fix it, I'll give it 5 stars."}

I like the snappy response time with some of the apps and the weight is just about right (just slightly heavier than expected). I like the NVIDIA GO store options and software titles that it offers, as well as,many of the games that are specifically configured for this tablet.\n\nI honestly bought this for mostly games, but I actually do some productivity, studying, and reading on it and so far it has fared well with the apps and things that I needed. I am still getting use to the workflow and design for my personal style, but the tablet itself works well.\n\nPros:\n - good sound\n - good speed\n - expandable memory to 128GB (I maxed it out)\n - screen size is great for what I need\n - good/great sound quality\n - very small textured edges allow you to control the grip when holding in landscape orientation\n - versatile connectivity to TV, Shield, Controller, PC, etc.\n\nCons:\n - some of the hefty updates take up storage so you will need to save large apps and files to added media\n - the weight may be a concern for some (I appreciate it because I can \"feel\" it in my hands and not worry about it slipping away unnoticed)\n\nOverall, a great tablet for the price and the options it provides"}

It's not the cards, it's the tablet.  Nvidia has promised an update apparently, but that was months ago and nothing has happened.\n\nIf you are okay with only 16 GB of storage, this tablet is okay.

The first was for me, and I returned it to get the ASUS transformer ASUS TF701T-B1-GR 10.1-Inch Tablet because it is all aluminum, 10\" 2460 x 1920 display which with the dock haws a 15 hour battery life. I had purchased this during a promotion and got the game controller free. I really thought at that price... I should keep it, but I really did not need a third tablet, so it went back. Then we got our son a toy he has been wanting for years now for his graduation present DJI Phantom 3 Standard Quadcopter Drone with 2.7K HD Video Camera and he needed a tablet to monitor and record the flight. There was not another tablet that I considered. He is going into AI programming at the top school on the planet and is going to need a powerful tablet... for more than monitoring his drone ;)\n\nWith the most powerful hardware and a very respectable display at the same price as your average, or even budget 8\", this is a no-brainer...except for discrete groups of people...so, who are they?\n\nMy parents, now in their 80s would not like this tablet.\nIt only has a 5 mp camera. If you use your tablet a lot for photos or videos, this might not be the best to choose.\n\nIt is pretty plain vanilla in terms of styling, so if you treat it as a fashion accessory, same thing.\n\nHOWEVER if you are looking for performance, this can not be beat in a tablet at the current time (though there are hybrid machines like the zenbook which might be better for some).\n\nNvidia knows their audience. This tablet comes with nothing except a quick start guide. It is actually kind of funny that in that little booklet they tell you to use the oem charger. (Might want to edit that Nvidia). My son actually read the manual :O and asked where the charger was. It is that usb cord everyone has lying around.\n\nThe one other thing which bugged me about this tablet is how very google they are, so if you are not a fan, might want to look at another tablet. Nvidia hasn't bothered with much of as skin or added software (though the lack of bloatware is pretty nice).\n\nYou could call it a blank slate.\neasily customizable.\n\nThe one other not so great thing is that it only comes in 16g. Yes there is a card slot, and you can add up to 128g, but more apps run in ram not on sd cards, so I suspect a bunch of people will be stripping apps off and putting them back on etc.\nIf/when Nvidia comes out with a shield with 64g or a 128 ssd it will be a game changer.\nUntil then it is a very solid choice.\nand better still, Amazon has them back in stock. It was tricky getting these for a while and there were some unscrupulous marketplace sellers charging up to double retail for them. (Just in case these sell out again, which could happen; retail is $199)."}

It can literally run any game a high powered gaming pc can at a beautiful 1080p with 60fps. The GeForce now streaming service, while still in it's infancy, runs flawless. It does everything a regular tablet can do all while being this beast of a gaming machine. It's very affordable and if you want the best of the best you have come to the end game of your quest.  This is the ultimate device for the hardcore gamer. You need this machine."}

Second one they shipped me, the Bluetooth doesn't work at all and proceeds to ruin the regular speakers even after you turn off Bluetooth. These K1's are refurbished returns of the first model that was recalled for fire hazard batteries in my opinion. Great idea and concept and what not. Completely worthless if I can't use it and all of the functions it offers. RMA was a f*****g nightmare! Hopefully the next generation is better."}

I've owned it for about 6 months now, and I upgraded from a Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 (first Gen). Granted, that was an old piece of hardware, but this thing is lightning fast by comparison. I'm sure there are faster tablets on the market at this point, but for $200, you can't beat this. It comes with nothing but the tablet itself. You get no wall charger block, no cables, no cover. Nothing. So be sure to order all the accessories you don't already own (most people have the USB cable and wall charger at this point anyways). I haven't used all the features, as my desktop computer doesn't have a new enough video card to do the game streaming functionality. I do own one Nvidia Shield Controller for this, and it is great. I run emulators for everything from Gameboy and Atari to N64 and PSOne on this tablet, and with the controller and the Mini HDMI output, you've got yourself a very portable gaming system. If you're looking to run emulators (like I do) and play old games, as well as some of the new ones, this is the tablet to get."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0171BS9CG", "review": "Arrived today. This was a low cost alternate to an 8\" Samsung S2 at 2X+ the K1's price. Unboxed and updated the tablet, which took awhile as the update moved it from 5 to 6 plus bits and pieces. When all that 2as done, it was to let Play Store install the apps I use on my Nexus 6 phone and had used on my Nexus 7 before it took a dump.\n\nWhen that was all done, it was time to tinker. I am NOT a game player, but a reader and a browser user and shopper and so on. So I disabled, or tried to, the installed apps that dealt with games and such. Of course, I dropped in a 128 GB SDX card from SanDisk (also from Amazon) to the device, under Android 6.x acts as though the 128 was added to the onboard stuff.\n\nThe 8\" format makes it possible to read my magazines on screen, and still be able to actually read them (with glasses!--I am 74, BTW<G>) and to read sites without having to make them larger (as is required on a 7\" device) but without the heavier weight and clumsey size (IMHO) of the 10\" -- I have a 10\" Samsung Note, first edition, I seldom use. Just like my wife's original Motorola 10\".\n\nThis thing is usable. And fast and the touch screen is so smooth and nice (compared to the low end Kindles I otherwise use and to even my Nexus 6 phone!).\n\nWhile I seldom use a tablet or phone to play music, mostly because I can't hear it well, even at full volume ,unless I use headphones (I'm deaf in my right ear). But right now I'm listing to an old Merle Haggard album on the K1 8\" away from me with the volume down a touch using Media Monkey.and a WD UnP server/NAS, And I can hear it even with the TV blaring in my usable ear..\n\nThe stylus was too $$ on AMazon or even at nvidia ($10 shipping? Geez!) B&H Camera had it for list price with free shipping.\n\nWill revise later if I need to. But I am a happy buyer at this point.\n\nThis is a first impression,"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0171BS9CG", "review": "I would like to start by saying that I bought this used from Amazon. That being said I was surprised to find what I got was a 1st gen shield. How do I know!? Well my device came with a stylus (in its stylus holder located on the tablet) and a charger. Both of which don't come with the new k1. I did some research and the only difference between the k1 and the 1st gen shield is the battery.  The first gen tablet used a 5200mAh battery which is believed to be the root of the over heating issues found on the 1st gen.  The k1has a 5100mAh battery, so I opened my delivered device to find a 5100mAh battery. So I feel I got a k1 with accessories for less than the normal used price. Maybe I got lucky, maybe this was recalled device I don't know but I'm happy with it. Now is it a good tablet? After ota updates to marshmallow...? Kinda. It's not bad but I would recommend you do your research on how and why to root this device and install a custom rom to get every last bit of awesome out of this tablet.

It did fairly well but did got lagged once which I thought was supposed to be non existence. I purchase this and galaxy tab s2 and have to say that Samsung is better in every single way. But of course its also cost $100 more than the shield k1. I suggest either put out extra $100 for Samsung or save up more for it. Its totally worth it.\nPros)\n1)Tablet is more elongated. Picture an iPhone 6s+ but in 8 inch. Shield is more rectangular compared to tab s2 where its more squarish. 2) pretty smooth and speedy browsing online. 3) speakers are OK I guess.

DEFEATS PURPOSE OF ME BUYUNG THIS TABLET SO I WOULDNT LAG!!!\n1) power and volume button is poorly design and hard to use. 2) SD card slot is horrible. Hard to insert and sometimes won't pop out. 3) if your purchasing this for gaming like I did it gets very uncomfortably hot to hold after 1-2 hrs use. 4) heavier and bulkier than what imagined. 5) battery drains fast and that's without updating it yet. 6) screen is a big disappointment.

I upgraded to this tablet after being incessantly annoyed by a hardware/firmware defect in my Nexus 7 2013 which caused it to randomly reboot, and I am so happy that this was the tablet I chose.\n\nWhat I LOVE about this tablet:\n+ very fast and snippy interface and performance. It feels like a flagship device at a third of the price\n+ the price - this is truly value for the money at 199 USD. Nothing has ever come close except for Google's Nexus 7 line\n+ mostly stock Android experience except for five or six preloaded applications\n+ very good build quality. Feels very solid. It's a bit heavier than the Nexus 7 and your arms WILL get tired if you're holding it with only one hand so I would suggest that you buy a good stand for it if you're going to use it to watch stuff. Playing games on it (with the support of two hands) should be no problem however\n+ has microSD slot and microHDMI port. awesome.\n\nWhat I LIKE about this tablet:\n+ the NVIDIA Shield Hub application is actually useful in discovering Tegra games and new/popular android games in general. Interfaces well with Google Play store. You can disable it (although you can't uninstall it) if you're really not into gaming\n+ the volume of the sound is way above the Nexus 7. The quality of the sound is mediocre but you can always hook it up to a pair of earphones or bluetooth speakers if you're after sound quality. I do like the fact that it's loud enough to watch tv shows on it without having to resort to external earphones or speakers (I'm really not very particular about sound quality, just the volume)\n+ there's an option in the settings menu where you can choose if you want the tablet to be in battery saving mode, optimized mode (which is the default) or in maximum performance mode\n+ the screen is sharp, bright, and just the right size: not too small, and not overwhelmingly large. The resolution is also very good (even though it's not the best in the market).\n\nWhat I HATE about this tablet:\n- the camera application is SO basic it could pass for a white girl ordering pumpkin spice latte in starbucks during autumn. It's not a deal breaker though - you're buying the tablet for gaming, not for selfies, plus you can always download better camera apps in the play store and just disable the default one it comes with\n- the tablet arrived with lollipop pre-installed, then it downloaded a 600mb update to android marshmallow (this is the good part). The bad part is that after the update was done, it installed the game Fallout Shelter as a system application (meaning you can't uninstall it) which is EXTREMELY crass of NVIDIA to do. Do what I did - write an angry feedback then disable that game if you don't care for it\n\nWho this tablet is for:\n* People who like gaming on the Android platform\n* People who like watching stuff on their tablets while lazing around in bed\n\nWho this tablet isn't for:\n* People who like taking pictures with their tablets (uggh)\n* People who hate value for their money\n* People who REALLY REALLY hate Fallout Shelter\nConclusion:\nUnless Google or Nvidia or some other OEM makes a better gaming tablet at this price point (sub 300 USD) this year, this is the best gaming tablet you can buy."}

One of the primary apps I intended to use with this hardly worked at all. My phone running on Marshmallow runs the app perfectly. I discovered the Moonlight app, which allows me to do game streaming with my existing devices, so the primary function of this is easily reproduced by a free app. The device is actually pretty heavy for its size, also. I *love* my Shield Android TV. I have 2 of them I like them so much. I think the primary tick against this device is the poor battery life. I'm a gadget lover, so it had to be pretty bad for me to return it. The news that Google is about to allow Android apps on Chromebooks had a lot to do with my return.

Playing games like Half-life 2 and Portal with the Shield controller is great, especially when connected to a tv with an hdmi cable. It's practically a console/set top box that doubles as a tablet.\n\nI did think it was strange that it didn't come with a micro usb cable, and if you use an iPhone and don't have a micro usb cable, be sure to pick one up, maybe with a wall charger adapter so you can charge this.\n\nAs for the title of this review, do yourself a favor and look up Android M SD Card Adoption because out of the box the first thing my tablet did was update itself to Android M. With Android M you can't just move apps to the SD card like you can with other versions of Android, but you can \"adopt\" a card by using it as internal storage. There is a process to this and some cards work better than others. In addition to that the card must be formatted, and it's best to format it as NTFS before letting the tablet format it as internal according to a lot of websites.\n\nAnyway extending your storage like this with a 64GB or 128GB card is a good idea if you plan on playing the heavier apps because some games are very large like Doom 3 BFG Edition which takes up about 4GB which is about a third of the usable internal formatted storage available and they can easily fill up your tablet if you don't use sd card adoption."}

Even putting it on airplane mode and only turning on wifi gives just over 5 hours of use. This is light use - twitter, web browsing, email. Screen on 50% with adaptive lighting. No location. They claim 10 hours, but that is not even close.\nNumber 2 is customer service. And I mean number 2, so you can enjoy that humor. After waiting 25 minutes on chat (although they said it would be 6 minutes), the chat person ignored me for another 10. He said he was assisting other customers. When discussing the battery drain, he didn't read what I wrote. He suggested things that had already been done. And provided no hope of solution. This is being returned to BestBuy.\nI had upgraded to the latest SW patch, fully charged the tablet, and let it cycle for 3 drains (below 20% before recharging)."}

Apps and games run very smooth. Price is also excellent for such a tablet.\nThe 16GB internal flash memory looks small at the beginning, but the OS footprint is less than 2GB - still lots of memory space left free. Furthermore, with the recent Android 6.0.1 update, it will be possible to use MicroSD card as an extension for installing apps and games up to 128GB. So you would better buy a fast SD card when you extend the memory.\nI particularly found the stereo speakers very nice, delivering crisp sound - both for music and game play.\nThe only thing which I miss, 3.5mm stereo headphone jack does not support android inline-control buttons (play/pause, volume up, volume down). I tried both with my Bose and Sony headphones - no success..."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0171BS9CG", "review": "Love it except for one thing: This is one of the first products to use Direct Wifi. The shield and roku both use it for controllers. Both have the crazy feature of NOT BEING ABLE TO TURN IT OFF on it's own. It auto changes to the channel of the wifi you connect to, so if your router is set to auto-channel, it may cause it go into a crazy channel switching frenzy. With some older routers, it will overwhelm them and cause them to lock up or drop some other devices. You can spot this with any wifi analyzer when the shield K1 is on. The only way to turn it off is to turn off WiFi altogether. I have to manually turn my wifi off when I don't want other devices (for me, phones, tablets, consoles and pcs) impacted by the tablet's direct wifi.\n\nWill not impact 5 GHz (direct wifi will not operate at this band because it could impact air travel)"}

It seems to be the weakness of this tablet, if you're not close enough from your modem/router, it can lose the signal.

As soon as it became available ordered mine directly from NVIDIA and received within 3 days. By the time I received mine it was sold out again. Grab it if you can find one, you won't regret it. For $199 it's a great bargain.\n\nSamsung S2 is much wider and hard to fit in pocket and hand. My Shield K1 is a tight squeeze but still can slide in jeans front pockets.\n\nUsing the bluetooth on I'm able to connect to internet through my windows cellphone seamlessly without even having to activate hotspot feature on the phone.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0171BS9CG", "review": "I needed a replacement for my Nexus 7 Tablet which is on its last legs, and the NVIDIA SHIELD K1 Tablet was a great choice for me. Priced about the same as the N7 was 2 years ago, the SHIELD K1 offers much greater performance and a slightly larger screen. In the box, all you get is the tablet. A charger and USB cable are not included. This might be an issue to some, but it wasn't to me. I have a drawer full of chargers and cables. On its first boot, an update to the latest Android 6.01 was available, and I updated it. It was quick and painless. I was very pleased to see that the stock Android software included on the SHIELD K1 is very vanilla, and has very little bloat other than some NVIDIA programs. The tablet has a very nice 1920x1280 8\" screen. It's bright, clear, and the colors are accurate. Performance is excellent especially if you're a \"gamer\". My Antutu 6 Benchmark Score is 92,000+. This is achieved with the Shield's 192-core NVIDIA Kepler GPU and 2.2 GHz quad-core CPU. Battery life is slightly above average. I'm getting around 6 hours of usage. I was a little concerned about having only 16GB of internal storage, but you can add a MicroSD Card up to 128GB. You can also migrate the SD Card's storage with your internal storage, allowing you to install most all your apps on it. I recommend getting the fastest card you can afford since external storage will never be as fast as internal storage. Sound quality on this tablet is loud and above average. It is much better than the Nexus 7. All in all, the NVIDIA SHIELD K1 Tablet has surpassed all my expectations. It's fast, well built, and works well. Priced at $200, it's in my opinion the best Android tablet you can currently get for the price.  I've attached a picture of the SHIELD K1 next to my Nexus 7 to show how they compare size wise."}

The battery life is fairly good (for its specs) without underclocking, if you underclocking it (which can be done in settings) it will get really good battery life.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0171BS9CG", "review": "This tablet has some great reviews and some of the comments are warranted. But overall this is a poorly built tablet. I purchased mine in mid March and just 6 weeks later I find the screen has a large crack. I have owned many tablets in the past 5 years and treat my electronics with the care they deserve, and have never had a damaged screen on any device. This tablet was no exception in the care I've given it, yet it suddenly the screen is damaged, huge disappointment to say the least. And just a few weeks past the point of return with Amazon. If the crack had anything to do with mistreatment of the tablet I'd own that and not complain, but it was simply poorly design or defective.\n\nAside from the crack the power button is way beyond frustrating. It's not just mushy as some have described, but I end up having to hit it 2 or 3 times often to get the device to turn on or off. Requires way too much attention to use. No excuse for this low quality and attention to design detail. The bezels on the screen are larger than I think necessary. It is a decent screen but the tablet could be smaller given screen dimensions.\n\nOn the plus side? The processor is decent, giving it good performance. It is a pretty pure Google Android experience and it running the latest code with semi-regular updates. Would I buy it again? Nope. If it were $150, maybe, $100 yeah for sure. But at $200 there are better options out there given my experience with this one."}

There are definitely some positives about it, namely the price, expandable storage, and near stock experience if that is something you like. But after that, it becomes harder and harder to look beyond its incredibly frustrating flaws. I bought this to replace my 2013 Nexus 7 which was performing fine up until Android Marshmellow.\n\nOn first impression, its performance was snappy and I liked that the stock Android experience was similar to my Nexus. I was excited to try some gaming with the 192 core GPU to see how it would handle it. I booted up Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic and enjoyed seeing no visible stutters or lag. Upon inserting my 128GB microSD card in, I immediately ran into issues where the tablet wouldn't recognize the formatted adoptable storage. I tried installing apps to the microSD card but after an hour or so, they would just become corrupt when the tablet would try reformatting the microSD again and again. To this day I haven't been able to get the adoptable storage to work with the tablet and I've tried numerous microSD cards. Disappointing.\n\nBuild performance didn't really impress me much. It's a matte plastic body that does a decent job of minimizing fingerprints, although anytime you have grease or sweat it will show on the back. The screen is decent but not overly vibrant or bright. It's a far cry from a SuperAMOLED screen that's for sure. Holding it in the hand feels fine, but is nothing to write home about. The build quality is pretty low compared to any Samsung or Sony tablet, but then again, it is nearly half the cost so that is to be expected.\n\nThe one major thing that kills this tablet though is the reliability of WiFi reception. This thing drops WiFi all the damn time. Makes streaming videos horrible and just slows up other apps that depend on having a stable connection. Even standing no more than 3ft from my new router yielded the same unreliable results. Any time I tried to connect to my Chromecast, it would buffer forever while trying to load the video, while my phone WiFi has no problems at all. Seriously, this thing sucks at WiFi.\n\nThe positives just don't do enough to offset an unreliable piece of hardware, no matter how cheap one can be acquired. After only a few months I am now on the hunt for a new Android tablet which is disappointing."}

The NVIDA customer support person told me that after a year, the tablet was pretty much junk if not sent back in the 12 month warranty period, and they would not repair or replace.\nHistory: I purchased this tablet through Amazon, as well as a $30 custom waterproof, shock resistant, hard case and took excellent care of this tablet. I will say that the tablet only worked for a few months, and went bad sometime in 2017. The issue is the tablet just died one day, and never took a charge again.  So I'm assuming the charge port or the battery are failing. Either way, it's very disappointing that I can't get NVIDIA to help repair or replace. And because of this, I will never purchase an NVIDA product again. I would also strongly recommended that you do  not either.. Anyone that has one working over a year, consider yourself lucky, and I hope you do  not have to deal with NVDIA customer support.\nPS> I have other android tablets, and ipads, for a longer period of time, and have never had any issue with them to date.\nGood Luck!"}

The specs were through the roof and the price was amazingly low. Then, around mid July it started losing charge even when plugged in........then it started charging slowly.........then never getting over 43%  and then rapidly losing charge when used. We tried all suggestions from Nvidia and those offered in forums online........... this thing went from excellent to brick in a few weeks (if that). There are no replacement batteries (from maker or 3rd party) and Nvidia does not do repair work on the model anymore. The warranty was for one year........that is expired. Oh well. If you can buy a new one? it is worth a shot, but folks are reporting this issue much sooner after purchase these days. Evidently, any new units have been sitting around w degrading batteries as well. If you own one and have this issue? We feel your pain."}

Needs refresh to handle 802.11ac wireless as well as H.265 offload.  Bluetooth 4.2/5 support w/ aptx HD and/or LDAC would also be very helpful.  would buy another if they would release a new version."}

Theres something seriously wrong with the model of touch screen they use, it cant register taps or dragging very well if at all.\n\nI just picked it up this morning after leaving it on the charger overnight only to have it go dead anyway because the piece of trash decided it wasn't going to charge its battery for some reason.\n\nSeriously, AVOID BUYING THIS if you value your money"}

Don't even bother with the cameras. But it worked as it was advertised. It worked decently for gaming and watching videos for a while.\n\nBut then it changed. The thing gets so incredibly bogged down at times. It won't respond to touch or power buttons or anything. It all just freezes up for no apparent reason! I don't have a ton of apps installed, nothing changing the original launcher or anything. And I've never downloaded anything anywhere else but the play store. So I've always been so confused at why it acted so strangely.\n\nThen it got worse. Whenever I turned the tablet on, I had to let it sit for five or so minutes so it could figure itself out. If I immediately tried to use it after it turned on, the whole system would freeze up! Incredibly annoying.\n\nBut finally today the whole thing gave up. I was trying to watch some YouTube videos and it acted like I wasn't connected to Wi-Fi even though I was. So I restarted the tablet. After it turned back on it was completely frozen up. Then, of course, the screen went out. Yes, seriously, the screen no longer works. It looks like it broke or has cracks in it, but its not broken at all. I have no idea what caused this but I am extremely disappointed."}
