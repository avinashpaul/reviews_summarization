{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I've been using this unique machine for about five hours now (update below). Before I review it, I want to give some context: I regularly use the Nexus 10 for mobile computing with a keyboard - arguably the best screen you can buy on a tablet.  I also have the first Nexus 7.  I have tried to present on my Nexus 10 and it crashed the projector.  So I have been using my Asus 1201n running Win8.1 to handle all MS programs.\n\nEnter the Asus T100.  I didn't buy it for the tablet option, though that is useful.  I bought it for a few reasons - 10 hrs of Microsoft usage without plugging in.  Good touchscreen.  Light - very important - it must fit in my small shoulder bag with my Nexus 10 and a book without strain. Fast processor - at least four times faster than the Atom dual core in my Asus 1201n, which really was cutting edge in Sept. 2010 (still pretty solid).\n\nMy initial verdict.\nScreen - you won't be upset.  Any rendering problems are Microsoft's and not due to the pixel count. If the pixel count was higher on this size screen MS rendering would make everything really small (Android is much better with this 10\" form). Asus's reading mode turns the screen a yellow hue, but may help the eyes. Touch functionality is exceptional - though reviewers say it only has 5 pt touch, not 10 (which used to be standard - not sure why this has been reduced - though I never use 10 fingers on the screen at once). Track pad is also quite good, though I'm not a clicker - I like to double tap - which this does well.\n\nCharging - slow\n\nKeyboard - cramped compared to my 12 inch netbook.  Cramped compared to my Bluetooth Motorola android keyboard (which is superb). But in five hours I feel like I'm already about 50% adapted to the key layout.  Way better than typing on the screen.  Definitely takes some getting used to.\n\nProcessor and performance - Snappy.  This is not an i5 chip, for sure.  But you won't wait for anything to load when launching apps. This is my fastest machine - it feels like a work horse to me, but I don't do video editing and I don't play pc games.  I do regularly use ppt, vlc, youtube ripper, lots of chrome.  Let's say I'm an aggressive word processor, browser, ppt user.  This is ideal for me, though I could enjoy a 12 inch screen.  The biggest issue that makes the screen feel cramped is simply the small Win8 text rendering - which can be adjusted.\n\nMy advice - I'd buy this over a Chromebook .  I'd buy this over the high priced but attractive looking Yoga and any other Win8 running Mac Book Air competitor (definitely buy it over a surface - you'd have to be crazy to pull the trigger on a surface pro over this baby). The 2gb of ram is much speedier on this machine than the 4gb ram in my Asus 1201n (that I upgraded).  I haven't had a ram issue yet and I'm running lots of programs and apps simultaneously.\n\nFor what it is worth, I agree with most everything said in this review: [...]\n\nEnjoy!\n\nUpdate after a few days of use:\n\nThe battery is exceptional. On a typical day I use the computer about 7 hours and I regularly have 30% left by the time I close the lid (brightness is set to auto adjust).  It also accepts a charge from my external battery pushing my mobile work time up to double the reported 10 hrs.\n\nI'm adjusting to the keyboard, but like many reviewers have noted, the right shift key is small and I often miss it.  Please note: the two feet of the hinge, which touch the table when the screen is up, can scratch a wood finish very easily.  I produced three scratches at home before I figured out what the sound was. Like one reviewer as well, my keyboard had a slight warp that made it wobble.  I've bent it back into shape.  Some parts of the construction seem needlessly cheap, like the warped keyboard and the glossy and sometimes flimsy back of the tablet.  Less like the Nexus 10 back and more like the lid to my old Asus 1201n.  You don't notice the flex until you pick up the screen in tablet mode.\n\nOverall, I continue to be impressed with the performance and functionality of the T100.  Win 8.1 is great on this machine. It is everything I wanted in Android that Google or MS won't allow - split screen, great multitasking, great MS Office experience. It has an awesome Baytrail chip with an exceptional balance between power and battery life. Rumor is, too, that once the first Android Baytrails are launched the T100 will be able to dual boot Android and Win 8.1.\n\nUpdate after one month of use:\n\nMy concerns about the keyboard are gone.  I'm fully adjusted to the size and placement of keys and I can type as comfortably on this machine as I can on a full sized keyboard.  I did notice the reduction in size for about two weeks, then it faded from consciousness and my typing seemed normal.\nThis is my daily driver - I have no need of any other computer or tablet with this machine.  I did load up a few indie games - particularly FEZ.  The  tablet keyboard combo seems to be ideal for this type of game.  You have about 10hrs of battery, so the only problem you will have playing relatively simple games on here is that they'll be difficult to put down.  My initial concerns about build quality diminish the more I use the device.  In my opinion this is the top of the pack for tablet and \"air laptop\" usage."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "Last years set of windows 8 tablets were a great start to getting windows 8 into the ultra mobile arena. The Atom processors in them kept them thing, cool, and energy efficient all while allowing us to run a full windows operating system halfway decently. They weren't perfect, with limitations like usb 2.0, 2gb of ram, poor graphics, and a sometimes lackluster desktop performance. Intel sets to out do itself with the newer Baytrail chipset giving better processing and video performance as well as compatibility with newer technologies. With windows 8.1 a while slew of new tablets are being released with newer processors and other updated specs, the Asus T100 is one of the first.\n\nDesign:  If you have used a transformer pad, you will be in a familiar territory. The T100 has a glossy back with the usual Asus logo coming out of the center. It is comfortable and has a decent enough grip  to it. The front compared to some other tablets has a decent bezel but nothing to bad, it helps when holding it so you don't accidentally touch the screen. On the right you have the micro usb (for peripherals and charging), micro hdmi, micro sd, and headphone jack. Top has power, and left includes a volume and windows start button strangely (the front windows button doesn't do anything). One bad thing is I am putting an sd card in to stay, and it kind of sticks out a little on he side which could eject it easily or have more of a chance of damaging it.\n\nOn the bottom you have the port connection the the keyboard. This snaps and locks in to the keyboard to kep it steady and from disconnecting. Overall the feel of the tablet on the keyboard is pretty good, it feels for the most part like a laptop (as well as looks like one albeit a tiny one). The provided keybaord looks good, it has a polished metal look and some good weight to it (which helps with the weight of the tablet).The size is fairly is tiny, which is expected and because of this kind of hard to type on, I wouldn't try a very huge typing session.  The only thing That I really don't like is the mouse pad, it works for pointing but the clicking goes far to deep and is just hard to use overall.\n\nDisplay: The display looks pretty nice, it has good angles, good color and just really for the price doesn't disappoint in the slightest.\n\nBattery life: I haven't had any trouble with it so far but I haven't actually paid enough attention to give an accurate say on it. It looks like I could get the advertised 11 hours, some reviews have claimed they got up to 12 hours even. I will try and update once I get a better read on it.\n\nSoftware: Windows 8.1 seems to have some decent additions to what windows 8 already offered. As I have said in other reviews windows 8 I think it is the most dynamic mobile operating system right now. I have used many android tablets, as well as Ipads and while they are all great in their own right windows 8 just takes the cake. Apple has the most apps (especially tablet apps) , Google is a good mix of openness and a large amount of tablets apps. Windows 8 doesn't have a ton of table optimized applications, but the ability to have a full windows desktop applications is just awesome. It runs a smooth touch interface tablet when I need it for that, but if I really want to do business I can do it with this and run real windows programs such as photoshop, flash, steam etc.\n\nPerformance: Bay trail performance greatly meets my expectations. Almost all of the performance woes I had with clover trail are gone. The desktop lag I had is now pretty much gone, applications and windows open pretty much immediately. I had issues with websites like hulu before and now it runs without any issues. The metro touch interface is as smooth as ever, dual apps work like a charm as well. I've also tested the gaming ability, with some older and newer games just to test out the video capabilities.\n\nThe first game I tried was Elder Scolls V: Skyrim , I know right , is this thing ever going to start? Well after a lengthy load session I got in and at lowest settings I got a 10-15fps really not the worst performance ever though not really playable. From there I tried some more realistic titles\nBastion - For some reason stuck at 20fps, probably a glitch between the hardware and software.\nLeague of legends - At low settings a very playable 40fps which is just great!\nHalf-life 2 - At medium settings I got around 40fps\nFar cry 2 - low settings 20 fps\nTorchlight - high settings 40-50 fps\nRollercoaster tycoon 3 - high settings 40+ fps\nTony Hawk HD - 15 fps\nLegend of Grimrock - 40-50 fps medium settings\nFlatout 2 - 40-50 fps\n\nI figure that should give a pretty good idea of what to expect as far as older games, it really doesn't do bad at all considering it is a 10 inch tablet ultra thing tablet, with 11 hours of battery and no fans.\n\nOverall my conclusion is a real giant thumbs up to this new generation of windows tablets. It did everything it's predecessor did but better. Asus itself gives a really great deal here including the keyboard that works well for what it is. The only thing I wish this tablet had is  dual digitizer pen input which if you have ever used it on these makes things a lot easier sometimes. Spending extra on a Surface Pro tablet might have some performance advantages but you lose a lot of mobility and battery as well. Looking at the other platforms I really encourage you to give windows 8 a go, it really has a lot of advantages to possibly consider switching over to this newer tablet market.\n\nYou can check out my videos of the T100 at [...]"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "Asus was the manufacturer of the best motherboards available 25 years ago. They know hardware well. My Linux based EEE PC 1000 was my device of choice for years, before the days of tablets, because it was so portable. The T100TA is about the same size, weighs a fourth as much, has respectable processor power, and mine has been running on battery for about 7 hours now and seems to have a quarter tank left. Like the EEE, this device put good electronics in an ok package.\n\nIt would make my fingers hurt to do any serious, all day, writing on this keyboard. The right shift key is tiny. I wish they made the comma and period keys smaller instead. That was plain dumb. The touchpad is not what you get with a Thinkpad or a Mac; but it's far superior to sacrificing half the screen and using a touch input. The screen is perfectly fine, not as crisp as my son's Nexux 7, also made by Asus, but it looks sharp and crisp next to my two year old Thinkpad. The sound is good. Importantly, it can charge up with my micro usb cables from my Samsung devices and my son's tablet. The dock/keyboard is pretty much an external keyboard with a usb3 port. The upside of that is it doesn't get hot. In the real world, this internet counts.\n\nI have been using Window 8 since it came out and 8.1 still feels awkward to me. Using my Thinkpad, I keep touching the non-touchscreen after only having this for a day. Use a touchscreen and you won't want to go back. I'm loving Bing News. To look at my information choices in a landscape format is comfortable on my eyes. Ebooks work well on this in that format as well. The recipe app can be used on a kitchen counter better than a tablet because it holds itself in place and it's way better than a big notebook which hogs the counter.\n\nInternet Explorer let a website popup a commercial which blared at me while my wife was sleeping and I couldn't turn it off before she woke up. I killed the popup box but the audio kept going until I exited Explorer. I installed Firefox and made it my default browser because it has plugins to protect me from those shenanigans.\n\nAre you a Kindle books user? This is the best device I have ever used for Kindle books. This counts a few tablets, including a couple Kindles. The reason is simple: Like a book, a tablet gets hard to hold after a while for those of us who have a hard time putting down a book. This sits on your lap, on a chair or in bed, and doesn't get hot or hurt your wrists holding it. The spacebar turns the page and seeing pages side by side feels right to me.\n\nIf this were an expensive device, I would give it three stars. If the software was more user friendly, I would give it five. Some reviews have noted that Amazon's vendor is charging more than retail for it. I would wait for it to come to $399. I just ordered a 64 GB SDXC card and should have done so when I ordered this. It should be good enough to hold enough data for me to get done the things I want. If you want a perfect compact touchscreen convertable computer, look elsewhere and dig deeper into your pockets. I think I'm going to be happy with this, especially after getting more used to the software."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "The ASUS Transformer Book T100 delivers a ton of value in a mostly compelling package. The beauty of today's computing devices is that consumers are no longer forced to buy one-size-fits-all, and instead, have the choice to buy what best fits their needs. I've used the ASUS T100 (64GB) over the past couple of days, and while I wouldn't consider it powerful/comfortable enough as primary computing device, I think it makes great sense as a secondary machine, especially with the advances in cloud storage.\n\nFrom my perspective, the ASUS T100 is basically a tablet with the ability to become a mini-notebook. Whether you will love or hate it strongly depends on what your intended application and expectations are. I plan to use the ASUS T100 for both work and recreation, with note-taking, email, web browsing, presenting, and video playback being the most common tasks, and from my initial impression, it does these jobs quite well. While I found the keyboard a bit too cramped for my liking (smaller-than-normal keys + tighter spacing + my big hands = not very happy), and wasn't too keen on the touch/clickpad (doesn't always respond to the first touch, two-finger scrolling can be a bit jerky, loud and hollow-sounding click), it wasn't a deal-breaker considering the price point. The keyboard dock is really usable, and I appreciated having it when I was typing longer emails and editing office documents.\n\nThe ASUS T100 features a Intel Atom Z3740 Quad-Core processor which is exceptionally power efficient and much better performing than previous Atoms, though it is still slow compared to traditional notebook/ultrabook processors. For example, the year-old \"low-end\" Pentium 2117U, rated at 17W TDP, is more than twice as fast as the Atom Z3470 in single-threaded workloads though it can also draw ~4X more power. The Z3740 is pretty even with the Pentium in multi-threaded workloads, through the slower single-threaded performance will be more evident with slower app/program launches, etc.\n\nAt the end of the day, I like the ASUS T100. ASUS has developed many 2-in-1 transforming solutions in the past and its expertise shows in the T100 ~ while made of the plastic, the overall build quality and precision is good for the price. I more or less agree with the specifications such as as the CPU and 64GB of eMMC, though I think 2GB of RAM is too stingy, especially since it cannot be upgraded later. Overall, I think the ASUS Transformer Book T100 is a much needed breath of fresh air and I'm excited about the future possibilities.\n\nNotes:\n1) Compared to the ARM versions of Microsoft's Surface RT and upcoming Surface 2 (non-pro), the ASUS T100 offers an exceptional value proposition by bundling Office 2013 and being compatible with regular Windows software.\n2) For my own computing needs, I found the combination of a portable machine with good battery life, paired with a powerful desktop to be ideal. The \"good-enough\" performance of the ASUS T100 along with great battery life and ability to fall back to full-blown Windows makes it well suited for this role.\n3) Web Browsing and Document editing on Microsoft platforms is generally a great experience. Internet Explorer on both Modern and Desktop modes is fully functional and delivers a rich web experience with Flash, Javascript, HTML5, etc. Office 2013 allows for native viewing and editing of documents which is something iOS and Android sometimes have difficulty with.\n4) Office 2013 Home and Student is pre-installed and includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and One Note. A serial number for activation is in the box.\n5) The charging cable is Micro USB but is very short by laptop standards. It attaches to the tablet side instead of the keyboard dock. The USB port on the keyboard dock is on the LEFT side.\n6) The Windows 8.1 UI feels very fluid though App/Program launches can be sluggish.\n7) Free space on the 64GB version is ~ 37GB. Windows 8 has a built-in recovery mechanism which allows you to re-install/repair Windows or remove all user files.\n8) The T100 supports Microsoft's Connected Standby feature which means it only sips power in the suspend state so you don't need to turn it on/off frequently. Modern Apps such as email are refreshed periodically even in suspend so the live tiles are \"fresh\" when you resume the system. Resume from suspend is nearly instantaneous. It should be noted that desktop apps are suspended during Connected Standby so they are not refreshed.\n9) Boot times are quick ~ the system can boot to the start screen in <10 seconds.\n10) A full-sized USB port on the tablet would have been highly appreciated...Hopefully a future version will have multiple USB ports!\n11) Slightly Annoying: The Windows button on the front/bottom of the tablet doesn't do anything! The only way to get back to the Start screen from the desktop is either to hit the Start Button or use the charms.\n12) Battery life is really quite good. I haven't run it down from 100% to zero but 8 hours of light use is very doable."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "The best version of the T100\nWhen the T100 first came out, it was fantastic on every level: A tablet that perfomed like any android tablet in but could run many of ye old windows apps, yet you could use it (as I did) as a netbook but with the added benefit of being able to charge it on a smartphone power bank, which was instrumental in extending battery life in a  full day.\nSince then asus has come out with several other t100 products that all had downsides: the chi seemed like it was good and had a 1080p screen and aluminum construction, but it still used the same bay trail hardware and puny 2gb ram and in addition had a bluetooth keyboard, and why would you want the hassle of charging up the keyboard when the tablet was right there?. the t200 - the bigger brother of the t100 with an 11 inch screen could sport 4gb of ram, but (fart sounds) could not be charged via microusb, although my dad is satisfied with it.\nthen the t100ha came out at its $300 price point, and I felt like asus may have finally gone back to the design philosophy of the original t100, with 4gb of ram, the new cherry trail cpu, and a non wireless keyboard... unfortunately the bean counters at asus somehow decided that a resolution of 768p (1368x768) was too tall of a order and reduced the new screen size to (1280x800) 720p: which doesn't sound much like a problem unless you use windowed programs that require just slightly more screen estate. The newer t100s also lack a full size usb port, although that can be mitigated with an otg cable.\nAlso, somewhere along the line windows tablets stopped shipping with a free permanent office 2013 license, and instead began shipping with 1 year of office 365, and from my understanding currently its just a office mobile which doesn't allow editing offline now. Windows 10 also has a problem with user freedom, and while it may be more optimized, it also likes to aggressively update your computer and make you restart even when you're working on something.\nSo the 2013/2014 t100s were the best t100, relatively underpowered hardware and inferior battery life compared to the new offerings aside, it came with full office that you could use forever, sufficient screen estate, a directly attaching keyboard, and an operating system that semi-respected user freedom, and a full sized usb port, and I am glad I snagged a brand new copy of this dinosaur at the sweet, sweet discount price of $110 - I dare you to find a better windows tablet at this price.\nThat is not to say this t100 doesn't have its share of problems: its the most netbook like of all t100s with only 1 front facing camera, the micro sd card reader has compatibility problems with some cards although it was a problem with sandisk that has since been resolved with newer microsd cards and the touchpad can be wonky (my copy came with the touchpad slightly protruding from the keyboard - functional but clearly something happened during storage), and of course its bulkier than the newer models.\nIf you're in the market for a cheap windows tablet and find one new at a price similar to what I paid, I suggest you grab it, and if any ASUS people are reading this, please return to this design philosophy with the next generation of t100. I understand that you can't provide a full size usb port anymore, and the t100ha seems to get most things right but is a screen solution higher than 720p so much to ask?"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "This device deserves an honorable mention. I bought this laptop nearly two years ago and it's still running strong, though I replaced it with a larger screen ultrabook for the workspace and power. I originally bought this laptop because I wanted to test the new hybrid form factor and I needed something for my return to college that was portable, had windows, and could do basic Word processing, browsing, and research for papers. This laptop did all that just fine without a hiccup. I still use this device regularly and the performance is as good or better than the day I bought it.\n  The Good: First I would highly encourage you to immediately upgrade to Windows 10. It just seemed to fix the issues I was having with touch screen accuracy and most of all the trackpad improved by significantly. So the hardware is as to be as expected with a device of this price. The screen is okay with good color and gets bright enough for most use. It is glossy, so if there's a light source behind you then the screen might wash out a bit (one of the reasons taking notes in class with it could be straining). It plays HD video just fine and has a good aspect ratio to do so. The keyboard is way better than I could have possibly imagined. It's a bit cramped but I have large hands and navigate on it just fine. It is island style keys but the keys have good response and are never mushy or soft along with a light satisfying click at the bottom that's far from being obnoxious. I've typed hundreds of pages worth of papers without much struggle. The keyboard is not backlit and the dock does not have extra battery capacity or a hard drive in it. Aesthetically I think it looks quite good. I put a carbon fiber vinyl on mine so I wouldn't have to bare the fingerprints the plastic displays. It's thin and simple.\n  The Bad: As is the cross Asus must bare the build quality may be questionable. The first unit I had the headphone jack didn't work and there was noticeable light bleed on the edges of the screen. The unit I swapped it out with is flawless. The glossy plastic attracts 'everything', wrap it. The speakers are pretty weak and don't sound particularly good. And finally my last gripe is with the charging time. If you don't use the supplied power brick it could very well take longer than an entire night to charge. Make no mistake the battery life is good enough for all day but you will be charging this thing overnight.\n  Conclusion: For the money I think you'd be hard pressed to find a better device in this form factor. My unit has held up well over the last 2 years and performance has kept up as well. It got me through an entire semester without any issues. It was easily capable of linking up to a bigger display to get real work done, along with a mouse and keyboard it acted like a desktop no sweat. I ultimately found myself never using the tablet portion as a tablet. It's pretty much strictly a laptop. That said it works great as a laptop for those on a budget."}

I rarely use the attached keyboard as I prefer to use the pop-up keyboard on screen.

The dock is difficult to reconnect, and feels very flimsy and breakable, and it doesn't move back nearly far enough, which forces you to either be far away from it (requiring you to increase the icon and font sizes) or to suffer from neck strain\nThere is almost no incline if you push it back, the screen almost never can go beyond the vertical position\n\nThe touch screen is fairly responsive but coming from using a smart phone every day, you quickly notice that if you don't click something perfectly on an android, it'll zoom in and you'll have to click one something in the zoomed in boxthis laptop doesn't do that. This laptop suffers even more, because it your touch click isn't perfectly on something,  which happens often, it just won't respond to your click at all\n\nI wouldn't play games on it, even the 'mobile' games for Windows tablets are sluggish at times, and Red Alert (1998) is sluggish when it wants to be.\n\nThe keyboard is sufficient, except it feels like a very cramped keyboard and the shift key is oddly small, but this seems to be the case with most small laptops\n\nThe good part about the laptop is the size, with a slick, but not slippery design. it's relatively fast (even if at times windows itself is slow), the screen quality itself is nice, and videos look nice on it, but if you have some super high end laptop, screen or computer, you probably won't be interested in this.\nThis laptop does support micro USB, I believe mini hdmi, and USB 3.0 with micro SD expandable storage, and an ordinary, basic quality front facing camera.\nEven loving android, I'd choose this over any high end android tablet any day, simply because you cannot get the freedom from a mobile platform that you can on Windows when it comes to installing programs or customization.\n\nI'd say this is a good laptop, but if I had to make the decision again, I'd probably want to try other laptops in this price range first"}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "So, after having used this little guy for round about a year, I think I've come to a conclusion on this netbook: It would be much better without a touch screen, and a keyboard that doesn't come off.\n\nBut first, the good things:\n* The battery life is excellent.\n* The keyboard is excellently made and gives good feedback while typing.\n\nAnd the not-so-good.\n* The trackpad is nearly unresponsive, the Smart Gesture technology works 3 out of 5 times.\n* The touchscreen is not nearly as crisp as it needs to be to run a desktop-version of Windows.\n* The wireless adapter is.. confused. It crashes randomly, especially when moving from AP to AP on the same network.\n* There are no USB-A ports on the actual tablet, just one measly port on the dock.\n* The screen is too big to comfortably read or type on (on-screen typing).\n* Under Windows 8.1, it will randomly freeze and shut down. This problem is solved in Windows 10.\n* The \"Home\" button on the tablet can get stuck inside the case (not seated properly).\n* When docked, the device is screen heavy (not a surprise) and will tip over, or slide off a slightly inclined plane (rubber feet don't have enough weight on them).\n* Rubber spacers separating dock from tablet tear off easily.\n* From the factory, this device comes with a 64bit-processor and runs a 32bit version of Windows. I really don't know why. It also isn't quite powerful enough to do things very.. quickly. It constantly struggles.\n* If you are thinking \"Aha! But Linux will remedy the Windows problems!\", you are sadly mistaken. The project that was patching together support for this thing failed, because ASUS used a very creative hardware configuration of new/mobile hardware that the debian-kernel doesn't even know how to talk to. They eventually fixed the booting by using ArchLinux with some Ubuntu injections and a custom GNOME install.. But it still crashes on suspend, the wireless-adapter crashes every so often and there is no driver available for the sound device. Oh, and no brightness control. It's borderline unusable.\n\nWhat I am trying to say is this: If you are looking for a Chromebook to check emails and take notes with, get a chromebook. If you want a tablet for reading, drawing and typing, get a Surface. If you are looking for a Netbook, buy a Netbook. This is a well-meant attempt to make one device do all those things and it just doesn't quite work out. ASUS knows how to make Netbooks, and they prove that with the build quality of all the parts that aren't touchscreen related."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "Purchasing the ASUS T100 was a bit of gamble on my part, or at least I thought so at first. I already owned a 20\" Sony VAIO all-in-one with Windows 8 (named my PHATASSTABLET), an ASUS i7 laptop with Windows 7, and a 7\" Kindle HDX. As far as I'm concerned Windows 8 is pure crap, to put it as nicely as possible; any moron who thinks that a full size computer should be operated with the same mentality (apps?) and user interface as a smart phone should never be allowed to develop computer software or operating systems. That said, the usefulness of a touch interface for smaller screens can't be denied, even though it's not nearly as useful with a large screen like the Sony. But I was looking for a lightweight machine with long battery life to use for writing, so I decided to give this little convertible a try.\n\nI consider this little puppy almost perfect as a mobile writing platform, even though I have XXL hands and the keyboard dimensions can be frustrating at times. Without the keyboard I prefer it to my Kindle as a tablet for web browsing and casual video viewing. Now that I've upgraded to WIndows 10, I'm even more pleased with the baby ASUS. The Word included as part of the Office 13 package that came with the system was the deciding factor when I was considering whether to buy this or a Kindle HDX 9 with a keyboard case. I've also used the Excel for expense tracking and similar simple spreadsheets, and paired with a TEKNET Bluetooth Mouse (model BM306, purchased from Amazon) this is a surprisingly versatile mini-laptop, making it much more useful than the Kindle for everything except reading books.  After upgrading to WIndows 10, and even with several large Word documents, I still have 34 GB of the nominal 64 GB SSD capacity available.\n\nAs you might guess, I would have been happier with Windows 7 and without the touchscreen, but I'm still pleased with the ASUS T100."}

Although I can still press it, it can be difficult to access at times and shows the build quality of this tablet. If you are in the market for a new tablet now, I think you can find more bang for your buck."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "l bought this tablet after lugging my eight-pound Toshiba to class left a bruise my collarbone, and I'm so glad I got it. I was lucky enough to find a \"used\" model still in the original packaging for $200 dollars, and it works perfectly for my purposes. I've had it for about six months now, and I have very few complaints to offer. I wouldn't get it to replace my actual computer, but it's fast enough to suit my on-the-go needs and works great for note-taking.\n\nThe Good:\nIt's just a tiny computer! Tablet-sized, but I didn't have to give up any of the perks of running a full Windows OS.\nComes with Microsoft Office (adapted for small screens)\nFast enough for web surfing, word processing, and streaming video without a hitch\nClear picture\nSuper light-weight. I throw it in my purse all the time and hardly even notice it's there.\nPortable. There's nothing better than having a functioning full computer smaller than some hardback books.\n\nThe Bad:\nIt's a tiny computer. Which, awesome as it is, has it's own annoyances. Mainly, everything is, well...TINY. It's your desktop hit with a shrink ray, which makes it great when you have to carry it places but really irritating when you're trying to open miniscule program shortcuts and hit isty \"x\" buttons in page corners. Which brings me to:\n\nThe touch pad. It sucks. In fact, it sucks so badly it's quite nearly unusable. It's horribly inaccurate and half the time I try to click something it somehow sends me back to the tiles screen. Which wouldn't be so bad, but:\n\nThe touch screen isn't that great either. It moves smoothly when I scroll with it and feels great, but it isn't as precise as I would like. I'm sure if I used a stylus it would help, but I don't want to have to pick one up every time I need to go back a line in my notes or close a window. It's sort of difficult to close/open programs or get to an exact spot in a line of text just using my fingers.\n\nThe Rest:\nThe keyboard is small (obviously), but it's responsive and I had no trouble adapting to it after a few hours of use.\nIt's sort of top heavy. Before I got my case, it liked to tip over at the slightest provocation when I moved my hands off of it. The case I bought for it corrects the problem.  (I would highly recommend the case, by the way. It's made especially for the Asus Transformer Book by a company called Poetic: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00H5DD7EQ?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00)\nThe version of Word included takes a bit of getting used to and doesn't have some of the features of standard Word (like the side-by-side page view, which I love), but it's optimized for smaller screens and makes it much easier to use on this little thing.\n\nOverall, it's a great thing to have if you're a student or frequently have to do business on the go."}

This little device (at the bargain prices it sells at) is a very functional item.  I travel with it and use full office to do my work.  I spend time on VPN often and countless hours in Excel and Outlook.  It hand,was all like a champ.  The only time I ha e seen performance issues is streaming video.  This aging Atom processor just can't quite make Netflix smooth.\n\nOnly real issue is the aspect ratio.  Great as a notebook.  Horrid for tablet.  Portrait mode is unusuable.\n\nThe keyboard is very easy to use even though it is a bit small.  Bright screen and the touch screen is very responsive.\n\nSo why replace it?  I love it so much I want the full Windows 2 in 1 experience.  I am upgrading took a Surface Pro 3.  For the money this device is a superstar though.  I am going to replace my kids Chromebook with it.\n\nIf you are looking for a budget travel companion this is a great choice."}

Had some small problems when I first booted it up, resolved by following the instructions (charge it first) and basic online troubleshooting (install all the updates).\n\nLightweight, portable, feels durable, pops off the keyboard base easily, but when you have it attached it is firmly connected (this is good).\n\nIt has had all the processing power I've needed for my uses (internet browsing, Microsoft Office, Steam games).\n\nSteam games that ran on here just fine: Don't Starve, Half-Life 2, Portal.\n\nMake sure you use the wall-outlet charger that comes with the tablet - it has a higher amperage rating (2A I think) so it charges much faster than if you use a standard phone charger (found this out the hard way).

As it is I think the best thing I can do with it is throw it out the window so I can keep my sanity.\n1) When I got it new it ate the battery. I would go dead overnight while it was \"asleep\". Finally called ASUS and they walked me through a reset procedure that finally fixed that. Great!  Well...not so great...\n\n2) Still had some issues so did the bios update. Went smooth, a nice easy proceedure actually.  Thought, \"now all is well!\"  It wasn't.\n\n3) Wireless/internet:  This is its down fall. It constantly screws up internet. It will either log on and then lose its internet connection or it will log onto the local network but won't connect to the internet....maybe...or maybe it will connect once but then lose it...or not.  I have spent hours going through all the recommended procedures to fix this but nothing works.\n\nA tablet that won't connect to the internet is about worthless. No email. No downloading books. No web surfing to find info. I hate this POS and it ends up sitting on a shelf gathering dust. I am still using my old WinXP Asus netbook because it WORKS!\n\nIt appears from what I have learned in hours of research that these tablets are a crap shoot.

The only big problem I have with it in those regards is that I really hate micro/mini plug-in sockets. If they had to make this thing 1/8-inch thicker or 1/2-inch wider to put in real-sized USB & HDMI plugins, I wouldn't have even noticed. But what I do notice is the obvious delicate nature of how soon something will snap as soon as it's bumped hard enough (or try to shove such tiny plugs in upside down).\n\nGoing on to the keyboard now, it could use some simple changes as well...\nWhile it does have a real USB input, a second one would be incredibly beneficial. Furthermore, while I do like how easy it is to attach and pull off, it should be able to open up farther than 90 degrees. The 90-degree limit makes this thing terribly cumbersome to use. Nice try, but the bonus keyboard (which is the reason why I bought this) is almost a complete fail for that design flaw alone.\n\nBut again, it's obviously not designed to be a computer; it's a tablet, so I want to be fair here. AS A TABLET, THIS THING IS WONDERFUL.\n\n-john, Snohomish, Washington"}

Team that up with an elderly person who gets frustrated computers in the first place and the unit doesn't get used as much as it should. Display looks great and although it has a plastic case, it seems to handle normal usage well. No scratches or cracks in 8 months of use. It is now waiting to go in for repairs as it will not power on, although it does not seem to be a switch issue. On occasion, you can see a very faint light emitted from the screen. The service rep on Asus chat was very helpful. The customer service part of their website leaves something to be desired. I ran into dead links and a form that wouldn't send.

I repeatedly asked to speak with a manager, and I was stonewalled from speaking to anyone with any authority.

What's worse, is that they're noticeably sluggish compared to a slightly higher-priced device.  They're also a bit heavier than you'd expect for something this small.\n\nStill - they do fit into a nice price bracket for what you're getting, and ASUS has generally put out good quality products in my experience.

(http://www.transformerforums.com/forum/asus-transformer-book-t100-help/39718-transformer-book-t100-cannot-connect-wifi.html) I wish I had. I loved it at first. It fit in my carry-on bag when I traveled, and I could type messages on the keyboard instead of the screen. It was also nice to disconnect the tablet from the keyboard and use it to read books or play games. Unfortunately, after about six months of using the tablet, the keyboard started communicating intermittently with the tablet and soon stopped working altogether. I contacted ASUS service and was asked to send it to them for repairs ($25 to ship). When the computer was returned, the keyboard worked again, but the now I couldn't connect to the Internet. I attempted, and was finally able to connect by using an external USB WiFi, but the only USB port is in the keyboard and was only useful if I kept the tablet connected to the keyboard. I contacted ASUS service again and sent the tablet back. (ASUS did pay the shipping this time.) When I got it back, the WiFi card would still not work, and my external USB one is now experiencing intermittent connection problems. When I contacted technical support, I was given a list of things to check and complete. I followed all of the instructions to no avail. My tablet is now beyond the date I can get it replaced, so I will have to send it back for repairs yet again. I hope ASUS can repair it this time, but am not going to hold my breath. If they do get it repaired 100% this next time, I will write back and give them giant kudos in this review."}

The update barrage that hammers this devices kills it even when controlled, just turn off updates and save yourself a massive headache or possible return. Updates will brick this device, always keep it fully charged or plugged in if you choose to run the gauntlet of updates.\n\nI fully charged the device, setup an account, logged in, Changed settings to allow updates to be downloaded but not installed until I say so. I started the updates and all was well for a day then it hit. I restarted after a set of updates and got only a black screen. Explorer refused to start or engage even when activated via task manager. Another restart and I got to the desktop but it was running very, very slow. Task manager reflected additional updates being installed and CPU usage at 80%. I restarted a few more times to allow the updates to install until I realized it was stuck in a loop, installing update 1 of 2.. over and over again. I tried system restore.. guess what Bitlocker is engaged, went to the web address provided to get my unlock key and an hour later I still have nothing in my email and nothing in my spam. I gave up tried to uninstall via control panel.. with each restart Windows 8.1 tries to install the same two stupid updates. I get to control panel and explorer crashes and dumps me into the tile screen. I tried to boot in safemode and guess what.. bitlocker has me locked out and still no code from MS. I tried requesting another code and still nothing! I'm ready to return this heap of crap and request a full refund. As a last ditch effort I tried disabling bitlocker so I can access the computer i forked out my own hard earned $ for.. and 30 minutes later it's still decrypting with the CPU at 80% for updates and the other 20% left for decrypting. Even while plugged in running at 100% CPU like this it isn't charging as fast as it's burning electricity. I'm afraid the battery will die before it's done.\n\nIt's a great idea for a low cost device that's a good combo of laptop/netbook and tablet. It's just a pity MS and Windows 8.1 with it's updates arrives on scene to ruin what might otherwise be a good product. I've had and used the Android versions of the Transformers and never had an issue. Stick Windows on one and it's a never ending nightmare of crashing and updates that break things."}

Look online, you will find HUNDREDS of posts related to this.  It's not a one-time problem, or a matter of the battery or adapter going bad.  I'm not sure what causes it- I suspect it might have something to do with the Windows update process (though HOW, I'm not sure, as I'm not particularly technologically savvy) as I notice problems occurring more often while the computer is in the process of installing Windows updates...\n\nWhatever is causing it, the result is that sometimes the computer will charge \"perfectly\" (from say 15% charge to fully charged in about 6 hours or so?  A little long but at least it charges!), while other times I have had it plugged in for more than 48 hours before I was able to get a full charge.  Sometimes the battery doesn't charge at all even when it's plugged in.  I have wasted hours of my life trying to troubleshoot this problem (even taken the computer apart to check connections) and I've admitted defeat.  I simply leave it plugged in whenever I'm not using it unless the battery is at over 80%.  Because the computer charges so slowly this means it's pretty-much constantly plugged in.  Not so useful for traveling!!\n\nI don't know where they did the trials on battery life but I've never gotten more than about 8 hours out of it.  Which is great!  But it's not 11 or 12, as some reviews seem to suggest!\n\nAlso, the screen is INCREDIBLY fragile.  I have always treated the computer very gently but less than a month after using it I took it out of my bag to find a crack across the whole screen.  Then the other day the screen actually cracked (in a different location) JUST FROM OPENING THE LID!  Very poor construction.\n\nLuckily, the computer still functions as a laptop but it's practically useless as a tablet.  Also, a other reviewers have mentioned the hinge only allows the screen to go back about 5 degrees more than vertical, which isn't the end of the world but it's still an inconvenience.\n\nAlso, sometimes the computer just completely refuses to turn on, even though the indicator light (glowing white) shows that the battery is fully charged.  Through lots of frustrated pressing of the \"on\" button and/or scouring forums and trying suggestions offered there I have so far managed to find the appropriate number and duration of key and button pressing to magically unlock the computer and turn it on, but it seems to require a different passcode each time.\n\nOn the plus side, it IS very pretty.  But I'd just as soon have my old school Asus 1015 PE that I initially hated but actually ended up being a great little computer, which made me think I should buy another Asus.  But I've now purchased two Asus computers in less than a year and both have been total sh*t so next time I buy a new computer I'm switching brands.  Anyone have recommendations?"}

If I could, I'd give this product, and Asus as a company, Zero Stars.\n\nWhile the Transformer Book could be a really awesome product (I did like it when it worked), it suffers from a battery failure issue where it will not charge, or takes days to charge, or won't turn on after a charge, or all of the above.  I know all tech is at risk for problems, and I understand a faulty unit will turn up now and then.  So, I sent it in for repair.  It came back with the same problem (a little worse, actually).  I wrote back to tech support, who said I could send it in again.  (Because, you know, they did such a great job the first time.)  After posting this review, I was contacted by a customer loyalty rep, and spent about 2 weeks, give or take, trying to get Asus to stand by their product and give me either a replacement or a refund.  They refused.  Ultimately, Amazon.com stepped up and handled the matter to my satisfaction.  It took Amazon all of about 5 minutes to solve a problem Asus hadn't solved in well over a month--whatever you buy, buy it from Amazon!  They're awesome!\n\nI'm writing this update from my 8 year old Dell, the one my Transformer Book was meant to replace.  It's had issues.  It's been repaired by Dell twice (years apart).  They aren't by far my favorite company in the world, but they're better than Asus, and my Dell products at least work--which is more than I can say about Asus on either score.  We also own some Acer and Lenovo products, which (so far) haven't had any significant issues.  I haven't dealt with Acer or Lenovo for tech support yet, so I can't speak to the quality of their customer care.\n\nWhat I can tell you is that my experience with Asus has been horrible.  Please be sure to read the other reviews, particularly the single star reviews, so you can see for yourself that this is not an isolated incident.  I heartily suggest you try another company, and that you buy through Amazon, who has the most amazing customer support I've ever seen.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\n\nWord of advice:  Don't buy the ASUS Transformer Book.\n\nWhen it works, it's really awesome.  The touch screen is nice, the color is good, it detaches and reattaches easily, and for a while I loved it.\n\nThen it started taking a ridiculously long time to charge (sometimes a full 24 hours), and when I tried booting after charging it, it gave me a black screen.  I did some digging online and found that a BIOS update often solved these issues, so I tried to flash the BIOS, but I got an error message saying that the current BIOS could not recognize the new BIOS ROM type.  I contacted tech support.  After going back and forth with them a few times, they decided it was probably a bad BIOS chip, and said to send it in.  So I did.\n\nThey were reasonably prompt in their repair, replacing the battery and reinstalling Windows (yay, thanks).  If they replaced the BIOS chip, they didn't note that on their return slip, but I figured they'd diagnosed it and fixed it, so I plugged it in and let it charge.  After letting it take a full day to charge the new battery (should that have been my first clue?), I started setting the system up all over again.  When I ran out of battery power yesterday afternoon, I plugged it in.  It's still charging.  Wondering how far it had left to go, I pushed the power button, and promptly got a black screen, which is why I'd sent it in to begin with.  After trying twice to get it to boot, it said it's only up to 20% battery power.  20% after nearly a 24 hour charge, with a brand new battery!\n\nI've contacted technical support again (11/22/14), but am still waiting for a reply.  I think it's time to request a refund.  :(\n\nUPDATE 11/30/14: After a 48 hour charge while turned off, the battery level actually DROPPED to 10%. Tech support just got back to me, and said I should send it back in. They won't offer a refund, but say they'll repair it as long as it's in warranty. Big deal, since the last repair left me with the same exact problem. I've requested that they escalate the issue and replace the unit, which I have to assume is defective if they can't manage to fix the thing with a brand new battery and a newly installed OS.  Seriously, stay away from ASUS.  I've downgraded this review from 2 stars to 1 star.  I might feel differently if they could actually give me a product that works.  Right now, I basically own a pretty, $350 brick.  Thanks, ASUS.\n\nUPDATE 12/3/14: On 12/1, a comment was left on this review by an Asus Customer Loyalty rep asking that I email him so he could help me with this issue, which I promptly did.  Two days later, I'm still waiting to hear back.  In the meantime, having previously asked to have this matter elevated within tech support, today I did get an email from another Tech Support Team Member (doesn't sound too elevated to me), who sent another RMA form and said I could send it in for repair again, and if they couldn't repair it, they'd send me a \"recertified\" unit--in other words, if my faulty Transformer Book can't be fixed, they'll send me someone else's faulty Transformer Book.  I've told them I will wait to send it in again until I've heard back from Customer Loyalty.  I will update this review further as the situation progresses.\n\nUPDATE 12/6/14: After leaving a comment here on the 3rd requesting a follow up, I did hear back promptly from the Asus Customer Loyalty rep, who asked me to send the original RMA so he could look into it. He's been looking into it for 3 days now, apparently, and I've not heard back yet. He tried to assure me that mine must be an isolated incident, but since I'd already researched the problem online prior to contacting tech support in the first place, I know that's not the case. At this moment, I'm updating this review on my 8 year old Dell XPS M1710, which, while it's had its issues over the years, still runs.  Sadly, it runs a lot better than the new Asus at this point.  The longer this issue drags on, the more I think I should have reinvested in a Dell product.  I can think of a lot of reasons not to choose Dell, but in the long run, despite their many issues, I still have working Dell products.  Dell even honored its extended warranty with a full refund when they couldn't repair a nearly 4 year old machine I owned because they'd stopped making that particular motherboard.  A full refund!  My thanks to them was to use that refund to buy a brand new, top of the line Dell desktop.  It's a shame I can't say the same for Asus at this point.  Asus tech support failed to repair the unit when it was sent back to them, said they won't do a refund, and before sending it back yet again, I'm now giving Customer Loyalty a chance to intervene and make things right.  Meanwhile, time ticks, the days and weeks go by while the warranty runs down, and the new, \"repaired\" Transformer Book sits in a box on my table, because it's unusable.  But hey, at least my 8 year old Dell laptop works.\n\nUPDATE 12/10/14:  It's been a week since I last heard from Customer Loyalty. The Transformer Book is still sitting in a box on my table.  I'll keep you posted on any further progress, or lack of progress.  Right now, I'm beginning to wish I could rate this at zero stars."}

Asus's customer service is deplorable. They have not only sent back the computer without even touching it (because we didn't respond to ONE email they sent that was in our junk mail. Couldn't try to email again, or maybe call?), but EVERY SINGLE TIME we get it back, the keyboard DOES NOT WORK. This time around they supposedly sent us a different tablet that was refurbished, and guess what? The keyboard doesn't work! I honestly believed Asus lied and it's the same laptop with some plastic covering on it. I don't understand, given that we have sent it back an exorbitant amount of times, why they can't just send us a new one and start over? They said that next time our 1-year warranty will probably be up so we won't be able to send it back. My husband hasn't been able to use it since I got it for him. I'm disgusted by Asus; both with their customer service and their terribly cheap laptop. Essentially, we a $300+ brick. This was an attempt to try a new company besides Apple, but I will NEVER purchase anything from Asus again."}

It ran Office effortlessly, it was light and nimble, and aside from enduring the learning curve, Windows 8 seemed like it was being unduly criticized.  I was in love.\n\nThen out of nowhere it failed.  I tried to turn it on and wouldn't boot up.  After chatting with ASUS customer service, they determined that it would need to be sent in for a warranty repair.  These things happen and I sent it in.  ASUS paid for the shipping both ways and within 10 days, I had my tablet back.  It had been reset, so I had to go through the trouble of re-installing everything.  Then after a couple days, the WiFi failed.  The wireless adapter simply wouldn't start or connect to any wireless network.  I called ASUS and they walked me through several steps to fix this.  Nothing worked.  They said I would have to send it back again.  2 weeks later, I got it back.  Other than being reset, nothing has changed.  The WiFi still won't work.  I've upgraded the driver firmware.  When that didn't work, I rolled it back.  I reset the T100 and tried it all over again.  Still nothing.  I am about to send it back again.  I'm beyond frustrated.\n\nIt's really a shame.  When working, this was a great device.  Unfortunately, it's been months since it worked.\n\n***update*** After getting it back again.  the wi-fi is failing again.  I almost feel lucky it worked flawlessly for a couple months.  Now it won't connect to the internet and it says there are no network adapters detected.  Hopefully the newer versions of the ASUS have addressed these issues.  they are widely reported.

It  runs Windows 8.1, has the new bayside intel atom chip, 2GB of ram, a 64GB SSD hard drive, a micro SD card slot, and comes pre-installed with Microsoft office. I was also impressed with the connectivity--it has a micro USB and micro HDMI connections which is rather rare at this price point. I bought mine through AMAZON for about $340. It is also available for less with a 32GB SSD (instead of the 64GB SSD I got) although doubling your storage space is definitely worth the $40 upgrade. Another alternative is that the keyboard dock is available it 2 forms: 1) with a 500GB hard disk drive, or 2) without any hard disk drive. I decided to go with the larger 64GB SSD and forgo any additional memory in the keyboard dock. I reasoned that the 64GB SSD would give me enough space to run all the programs/apps I needed. I also bought a 64GB micro SD card for extra storage space. This results in 128GB of storage for use in either the tablet or laptop configuration. If necessary I can also expand the memory by using the micro USB port to access an external flash drive or portable hard disk drive."}

Also, the sound is excellent. No need for external speakers because this little tablet can get very loud.\n\nThere are however a few problems which aren't great but i have learned to live with. First of all, the charging cable this computer comes with is way too short. I quickly replaced it because it made it almost impossible to use this computer more than 2 feet from an outlet. Also, the top of the laptop is weighted much more than the bottom. Sometimes when the laptop is in your lap or on a couch cushion it can fall over because it is so top-heavy. The touchscreen is challenging to use because at the default resolution everything is so small. I have thin fingers yet sometimes i have problems selecting the correct item, so what i usually do when i want to watch a movie is connect the keyboard, select the movie, hit play, then remove the keyboard and watch it on just the tablet.\n\nOverall, i am very satisfied with this laptop's performance."}

I've worked in IT, telecom and video conferencing for over 15 years, bought dozens of their motherboards, adapters, hard drive docks, etc..., and this thing is the worst piece of tech I've ever bought near this price point, by this or any other manufacturer.\n\nThe keyboard dock should a little chime when it's connected, and then another chime when it's disconnected. Fair enough, but the dock will connect/disconnect on its own, even when it's standing completely still. I sent the unit back to Asus for a RMA, and they *SAID* they replaced a wire, but it's actually worse than it was before. One of my coworkers watched the device, after the RMA, while it was resting closed on a motionless table, connect/disconnect/connect/disconnect/connect/disconnect over a 10 second period while none of us were touching it. What's the point of having a repair facility if you don't actually REPAIR anything?\n\nOn top of that, when the dock actually is working, the touchpad is horrible. I've turned off the gestures and gone through every step that has been offered to remedy the problem, and the unit STILL shoots the mouse cursor over to the bottom right while typing, immediately switching between the Metro UI and the Windows UI environments, and botching whatever I was trying to type.\n\nThe main reason I bought this unit was the USB port in the dock which would - theoretically - allow me to use this device for logging into various RS.232 serial ports on equipment in data racks, and save some weight in my tool bag. However, due to the lousy dock, the system will lose connectivity to the USB port and thus ruins any telnet/TFTP/SSH.etc..., session I was running, so I still have to lug my older, 8 pound HP i7 laptop because at least the stupid USB works!"}

About once a week, I need to remove and re-seat the tablet to the keyboard to get it to work again.  It also will lock up for no apparent reason; only a shut-down and restart will make things right.  I have not lost data, but it's still an annoyance.  I keep the operating system and other software updated faithfully, and do not abuse it.\n\nI have given it two stars not just because of the re-seating and lock-up issues. I also did so because ASUS has configured this tablet in a way where ONLY the ASUS-supplied charger will work. I have tried other chargers with the same or slightly more amperage and none will work. The same is true when using a >2A car charger.  It seems it is not the cable but the charger itself. If you do not use their charger, you are stuck.  The replacements are woefully overpriced.  For those wondering: if you key \"Asus T100 charger\" into the Amazon search, it returns results for many chargers.  I own one of the ones listed, not bought at Amazon.  It charges other devices just fine. My T100? No.\n\nThis is - to me - unacceptable, and strikes me as the sort of stunt one would expect Apple would pull.

I wanted a tablet for a while, but I wasn't going to settle for something that had Android or iOS due to the limitations that those operating systems have with regard to functionality and versatility.  Since purchasing the item, I have found many instances where I'm glad we made this purchase.  For instance, the easy ones: installing Java, Flash, and Silver Light.  You never have a fear that of coming across a video format or web site that you are not going to be able to view, because you can install any plugin that you want, because you have a full Windows PC.  We have even needed to install Citrix software for my wife for doing some of her work on it - no problems whatsoever.\n\n The tablet comes pre-installed with Microsoft Office 2013, which again, is great.  It runs quick and there isn't really any lag to speak of.  I even installed Visual Studio on it just to see if it could handle it, and surprisingly it could open up my solutions and compile my code with ease.  I like to use this more like a tablet, using Windows Store for apps.  The Windows Store is actually pretty good.  There is almost everything there that I have on my Android Phone, but even if I can't find it - who cares?  For instance, Spotify.  I can install the whole desktop version on here and play whatever I want for free.  My wife uses it more like a laptop.  She loves it for doing her email, lessons online that she could never do on an iOS or Android tablet due to required plugins.\n\nThis is an awesome deal and recommend it to anyone.  Also, it's great for when you're on trip because the battery seemingly lasts forever.  I love this thing, and am very pleased with it.  I can't wait to upgrade it to the new Windows 10!  Yes, you can do that."}

I brought this back in July and I haven't had any problems I use it daily. I had the Samsung galaxy note 10.1 2014 it's a great tablet as well but having full windows is so much better for me. This tablet is really fast, battery life is really good, the keyboard is really nice. Watching movies on netflix looks great and the sound is amazing! Some cons I have is the tack pad is really weird to use it's backwards than most standard labtops, though it doesn't bug me that much I just touch the screen. Gaming is pretty weak though I don't play a lot of games I did play GTA San Andreas it was pretty slow with all the graphics cut down. But most of the games play pretty good. Overall this is a wonderful bundle Great price full windows you can't really beat the deal"}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "When I received the Asus T100 I absolutely loved it.  I found it to be a very responsive notebook and enjoyed the functionality of it in tablet form more than I thought I would.  Unfortunately after about 2 months of use the tablet started showing signs of problems.  I would go to use it and it would be prompting me for a Bitlocker Encryption key which I had to get from another device and was a complete annoyance.  This happened every so often and when I finally had a chance to dig into this issue it turned out it was due to a hardware error on the mainboard.  Specifically the Intel Trusted Execution Engine was showing as slammed and that it could not start.  I contacted Asus and was issued an RMA and sent the notebook in. Service was quick and I had my notebook back in about 1 week total.  Unfortunately what they sent back was an even less usable notebook.  The technician that worked on my notebook stated they replaced the mainboard and the display.  I found this odd as I had no issues with the display but whatever.  I got on the repaired notebook and to my dismay could not get a stable wireless connection.  It would show it was connected but I could basically not get any data transfer.\n\nI started troubleshooting and discovered the wireless card was slammed in device manager.  I ran a repair on Windows 8.. no joy.  I downloaded the driver from Asus on my home laptop and transferred it via USB to install.. no joy.  I tried a full rebuild of Windows 8.. no joy and at that point the wireless wouldn't even show up in Windows under the network settings.  Device manager showed the device could not start.  Aggravated I called Asus back to complain and was issued a new RMA.  Notebook went back out to California and returned once again quickly.  I read the technician note and was dismayed to see it state they refreshed software.  I got on to the notebook and once again.. wireless non-functional.  The notebook would connect to my home wifi but trying to connect to a Microsoft account to setup Windows 8 would fail with a timeout error.  Trying to go to basically any webpage would fail.  Every once in a while it would connect to a page but usually not load all the elements on the page.  Google.com for example after 5 minutes had not loaded the daily Google doodle.\n\nThoroughly disgusted I got on a chat with an Asus tech and asked if there was any way to just get my money back.  Unfortunately there is not.  He issued me an overnight RMA shipping label and I sent the notebook back out that day.  That was 9/12.  They received it on 9/15 due to the weekend and as of today 9/26 they still have it.  To compound my frustration I got an email from a customer care agent today stating they had looked into the case and at this point the tech notes that they have found no problems. The agent has asked them to further test the wireless.  Unfortunately I didn't buy the replacement plan through Amazon so I can't return this P.O.S.\n\nI'll end this by stating I have been doing computer support professionally for 15 years now.  I have never dealt with a worse warranty repair system than this.  For one thing it is almost impossible to find a phone number to just call them if you live in the United States.  I have sent the notebook in with extremely detailed notes of what troubleshooting I did and what errors I can find or replicate.  On the notebook after an RMA repair is a folder that has log files that the tech runs.  I'd like to think that after sending in a notebook with faulty wifi they would perform more than a ping test on the wireless adapter.  But unfortunately that's the extent of their testing.\n\nSo for the tl;dr crowd:  Buy this at your own peril.  I have a friend with one that works fine.  In 4 months owning the device, mine has been wrapped up in RMA hell for almost 2 solid months.  At this point I have zero confidence it will be fixed when I receive it back, whenever that may be.  Absolutely the worst tech purchase I've ever made."}

I was cheap enough where if I lost it I wouldn't cry over it, and it worked great! The battery was wonderful compared to the Macbook Air I was using and performance was good for what I needed it to do. Then the trouble started. I dropped it, which cracked the screen and therefore I replaced it, (the repairablilty of this is excellent.) Then the LCD started to fade out, got a new one of those, then today while in my bag it broke again, this time with ghost touches. and this time when I took it apart, the power button fell of.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "For the price you can't beat this tablet. I don't know diddly about electronics so I had a few tech savvy friends do my research for me and they came through big. The value here is amazing, and I have always been a fan of Asus hardware. What I don't like? Keyboard functionality wore down rather quick and had to send this in for repairs, not a fan of the material on the back of the tablet as it is fingerprint magnet material and I wasn't impressed with the lack of storage considering the full OS system and the works from Microsoft Office installed. Other than that I have been thrilled with this little guy, even though I get joked for using it as a laptop (I'm a big guy), but its portability is paramount to its value. The price is unbeatable, and the only other option I would recommend is a Surface for this price range, which does not come loaded with MO. If you're on the fence about this purchase, don't be, well worth the $$$."}

This is a great little PC/Tablet, however I found it to have one serious problem.  The WIFI reception on the T100A is very poor.  At first I thought I had a problem with my router.  I contacted my cable provider and they did everything they could to help, but still very poor WIFI connection. Even considered buying a WIFI extender.  All other devices on my WIFI were working great, Toshiba PC's, Ipad, Iphone and printers, it was only the ASUS that was having a problem.  It worked great if I was 30 ft  in a direct line of site from my router, but if at 30 ft I would move behind a wall the reception dropped significantly.  Browsing was slow and Skype was almost impossible with the WIFI drop outs.\n\nI downloaded WIFI analysis app for my Ipad and was convinced it was the ASUS that was the problem.  Using the App to ping devices connected to my WIFI I found the Ipad at .2 - .6 ms, my laptop at 2- 17 ms, but the ASUS was extremely erratic ranging from 27 ms to as high as 408 ms and jumping all over the place with each ping.  All of the ping test were done with all of the devices in the same location, 4 ft from router.\n\nI purchased the ASUS to use around the house and found the WIFI so poor it was not acceptable.\n\nI am returning the ASUS now."}

My only gripe is that the right hand shift key is a little small and I miss it sometimes, but I will most likely get used to it as I use this more.\nI love the fact that I can also use this as just a tablet.  The camera is great for Skype and the battery life is 11 hours!  This is great for a student as videos run smoothly, it is speedy for normal everyday tasks like web surfing, email, writing papers, etc. The biggest bonus though is the free Microsoft Office.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I'm a month into traveling around the world with this computer.  I originally purchased it because it is light and can separate from the keyboard to become a tablet.  After month of carrying it in my backpack, it's so light I can barely tell it's there.  I use the USB 3.0 port on the keyboard a lot to transfer photos so I don't use it as a tablet very much but it's a nice feature.\n\nThe one problem, though, is with the USB charging.  Either something is wrong with my charger or it doesn't get enough charge from USB.  Even worse, mine charges erratically. I have had it charging while it was off for the past 2 hours or so and it only increased 1 percent. That's pretty ridiculous.  Sometimes I'll turn it off and I'll leave it charging overnight and it will fully charge.  Other times, it will only charge 5 percent.  The worst though, is when I leave it on (but closed) to charge it, it will actually drain the battery quickly.  How is that even possible?\n\nI was going to give it 4 stars because of the light weight and USB 3 port but that USB charging issue is really annoying.  I've had a few days where it was \"charging\" the night before but when I turned it on the morning, it was at 15%, making it unusable for the day."}

The problems that I have with the laptop could just be that I am not very knowledgeable in computers. However, you do get an email with this laptop, and they send you tips for the computer, so that is very helpful. I bought this because I went back to school to get my Masters online, and I hate how when you delete a sentence, the curser just keeps moving backward deleting everything. I am sure there is a way to disable this, so I can't really blame this on the laptop. So, in conclusion, if you're in need of a laptop ASAP and have a cap on what you're willing to spend, then yes, consider this. Or, if you're a person who likes a more mobile laptop that is small enough to detach and stick in your purse, then again, this laptop is for you. As mentioned above, this laptop does have A LOT of helpful tips, so the things that annoy me about this laptop could possibly be just my stupidity."}

I bought this computer in hopes that I would learn more about Windows 8.1 and tablets and all I've learned is that I don't like either.  It's hard for me to write a review since I should be writing about the computer purchased, not about how crappy Windows 8.1 is.\n\nIf you are a typer (as in you like to use a keyboard), the compact size of this board might drive you to drink.  I knew this when I purchased it but living with the reality of a tiny keyboard is really irking me.  I'm already looking forward to 3-4 years in the future so that I can trade this puppy in for a another notebook, which I truly loved.  The weight and size isn't that much different in comparison to the value I hold in wanting to actually use my computer.  And I agree with previous reviewers that noted how small the \"shift\" key is -- for such a necessary key, it seems to be ill-placed or just too small.\n\nI also don't like the connection between the tablet and keyboard.  It's very stiff and doesn't always work (as in the keyboard isn't functional)."}

It took me about 3 days to adjust to the smaller keyboard. That is my biggest complaint. In my opinion, Windows 8.1 is great FOR THIS PRODUCT. While Windows 8 does not belong on a desktop, I do not think there is a better operating system for a touchscreen laptop. It allows for an almost seamless transition between laptop and tablet modes. This device is not the best tablet or laptop available, but I believe it is the best hybrid available, and it is certainly the best available for under $400. One last note: the battery is every bit as awesome as advertised. While I am not a power user, I have used this as a tablet for two days, mostly in flight mode, on a single charge. In this time, I used nearly every app on the device. I have not yet had to charge this twice in a day using Netflix, Chrome, Word, and a handful of other apps primarily. In short, I recommend this device to nearly anyone, especially students. I am a high school senior and I plan to use this throughout college."}

It's small, so it's very easy to bring along wherever I go, and it has a microHDMI port for connecting a larger screen if I find myself needing more real-estate. The one issue with that is the placement of the microHDMI port does not allow for me to plug in the charger while I use the microHDMI port with an adapter. If you use an actual HDMI-to-microHDMI cable, however, it would work fine. I don't bother because the battery life is so great, that I can easily get a full day's use out of the tablet, and still have plenty of juice left before plugging it in at night.\n\nPros:\nSize - easily transportable\nPerformance - no issues running games from the App Store\nWindows 8.1 - Don't get me wrong, I miss Windows 7, but Windows 8.1 does make sense on this particular platform.\nBattery life - I can use the tablet for a solid 8-10 hours before I need to start looking for a charger\nEase of use - This thing is just so simple. It should perform very well for anyone in the target audience.\n\nCons:\nSize - sometimes it feels a little TOO small, particularly when working with things like large spreadsheets of family trees or web browsing with 150 tabs open in one window, but that's something you should know getting into it.\nWindows 8.1 - Like I said, I do miss Windows 7 in many cases. It's no ME or Vista, but it's also no XP or 7.\nTrackpad - it feels slightly cheap when you click it. It hasn't cause any problems, however, so no big deal.\nPlacement of microHDMI port.

I previously had a huge laptop that I couldn't hog to class all the time so I was seeking something that was small, portable, and efficient. This little bundle of awesomeness fits the bill! The keyboard is pretty small but it's not that hard to get used to. I'd say the mouse pad is not that sensitive but I'm too lazy to adjust the settings for it. There are a lot of fun apps on here, the annoying ones you can just delete. I'm still getting used to this kind of device but I'm really enjoying how user friendly and fancy it is. Make sure you charge it when you first get it and set your preferences for updates through the settings option. Also, my mom has problems being able to read the screen but that's just a resolution thing. I think it's fine but you can definitely adjust to your liking.\n\nThis is definitely worth the price and I'd recommend this to any college student who's wondering what kind of device to go with for the school year. This is a treasure and literally just sells itself.\n\nOne thing I want to mention though is that I use Skype all the time so if you want to use Skype with this you should buy an external mic or some earphones with a built in mic.\n\n**UPDATE 8/24/14**\nAfter updating this, it restarted itself. In the middle of restarting itself and finishing up with the update installation the screen went black and it literally wouldn't turn on. It was plugged into the charger and fully charged when I was updating it so I didn't understand what was going on. I went on a support website that told me to HOLD THE POWER BUTTON FOR 10 TO 20 SECONDS. If your ASUS won't turn on, do this.

I'm not sure why you would spend 2-3x the amount on a Surface that runs an RT instead of a full version of Windows and doesn't include a keyboard! Of course it has a small hard drive and processor but that's because all the guts are in the tablet part so it's a SSD. If you want the higher specs get a touchscreen that doesn't detach... It also has a MicroSD slot so you can expand your storage space easily... With that said, the model with the 500GB hard drive in the dock wasn't available when I got this laptop in December. I strongly suggest getting that model! I had 1 dead pixel on arrival but other than that no problems out of the box. I'll admit after a couple months it began to periodically have trouble coming out of \"sleep\" but it's never been a major issue. It's just a heavy sleeper! :-)\n\nPS: Most of you would factor this in before you make a purchase but maybe some of you wont. While my drive is 64GB only 49.1GB are available when you pull it out of the box."}

But before I had a chance to do so in the exact same week the screen cracked and touch response no longer works.  Honestly folks, I did not drop it or step on it.  I even  have tablet style case on it to protect it because I have read some reviews that it was cheaply constructed.

Regardless, this device has caused me so many headaches in such a short amount of time that I felt it was worth adding to the discussion.\n\nI bought the ASUS Transformer for my wife to use to study for and take her professional board exams. The one program she needed didn't require much computing power and we figured we could use the computer for web browsing after she had taken her exam. After 7 years of using only a Mac in our home, we were brutally welcomed back to the world of the PC by experiencing the following:\n\n-Random Blue Screens of Death, shutting down the computer in the middle of any number of tasks (happened while using Word, Firefox, IE, and waking up from sleep)\n-Contacting ASUS customer service\n-Flashing the newest BIOS\n-When problems persisted, reinstalling Windows (twice)\n-When problems persisted, sending the computer to ASUS for repair (customer service said it was a hardware issue but the work order showed that they just reinstalled Windows again)\n-Still getting the random Blue Screen of Death, so we continue to live in fear of actually doing anything important on the device\n\nSo, needless to say, my wife has not been able to use this device for her studies and has been stuck using our old computer that runs painfully slow but at least doesn't crash.\n\nI'm glad so many people are enjoying the ASUS Transformer, but buyer beware. In this case I certainly got what I paid for and will be returning this heavily fingerprinted paperweight. Hopefully I can get some kind of certification for all the troubleshooting I got to do right out of the box."}

We also loaded Corel's PDF utility and it handles merging and manipulating files, even large ones, with ease.

It is also much thinner than the MS Surface.\n(+) Long battery life.\n(+) The keyboard allows you to use MS Office programs more comfortably than an on-screen keyboard, though it is not a laptop replacement.\n\nCons:\n(-) It takes a half a second to open up programs when you execute them, so it still performs like a next generation netbook. The MS Surface Tablet is much more seamless but you have to pay up for that.\n(-) You can see where the money was saved in the materials of construction and lower performing processor.\n\nAll in all, you can not beat it for the money.

I turn it off when I charge it and it takes but a few hours.\n\nMake sure that what you want to do with this is not computationally or graphically heavy (especially graphically). This machine is great for light computing and managing my home network/cloud. It is not intended to replace my desktop or laptop or anything else, but to simply aid in managing all of my data. Sure it can run HD videos but it is not a powerhouse. An older game like broforce runs smoothly but a medium demanding game like magicka set on the lowest settings still runs at less than 6fps (which is excpected).\n\nThe best thing about this is its battery life. I use it to read white papers (on adobe reader app) at school and I usually have the screen on pretty much all day and the battery will last a solid work day (8 hrs) with 1/3+ battery to spare.\n\nI did a lot of internet searching before I bought this tablet and I even stopped in at best buy to test it out a few times.

I did have trouble with the many updates to 8.2 so I did a default to factory install and started over.  I then had it install five or six installs at a time.  The first go around it could never finish (even overnight).  And yes, I did what the guy said earlier.  Turn off auto dates immediately.  First thing but I did all at once which do not do.  Tablets aren't meant to do so much at once.  The book itself runs extremely cool.  The keyboard is perfect and the touch screen works great with Windows 8.2.  Not much bloatware installed.  I also turned over the live tiles as they are necessary is just \"eye candy\" which I don't do.  It isn't a gamer tablet.  Perhaps little card game here and there.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I've owned this for about 8 months, and it has held up well.  It's incredibly portable, and though I thought I'd use it as a tablet more before buying, I've detached the keyboard maybe twice in those 8 months.  So, I really use this as a very portable netbook.  But I also use it as my work desktop (not my power machine or HTPC; work only).  I plug into a large monitor when at my desk, and unplug the HDMI and power cable when I'm on the go.  It works very well, and things seem to have held up nicely.  Overall, I'm very pleased; it's just as powerful as my previous full-size (17\") work laptop, and eons more portable.\n\nA few minor cons: 1) I see the blue screen of death maybe once a month.  I'm not sure why, and I've tried to investigate using the error message generated, to no avail.  I just reboot and things are usually fine for another month.  So far, no big deal.\n2) Battery life started out wonderful--at least 8 hours of continuous use on a single charge.  Now, it's more like 5-6, and it drops off very, very quickly (and jumps to lower percentages, which is especially frustrating).  It's not a dealbreaker right now, since my Kindle and phone actually use the same mini (or micro, can't remember) USB port.  Easy enough to carry around one cable for all of them.  3) Bluetooth trouble: I was never able to get my Bluetooth mouse to stay consistently connected.  It wasn't the mouse's fault (I've tried several); seems like the T100's innards (technical term) shut off and reset whenever it sleeps, and it has caused havoc with my BT devices.  I just switched to a wireless USB mouse; it's not as convenient, but it works.\n\nI'd probably buy this again, unless I run into any massive failures in the next few months.  The battery is probably going to eventually go out, and I guess it becomes disposable at that point, but it has held up very well over the 8 months of daily use I've put it through so far.  Worth the $300 I paid on Black Friday."}

Its weight is reasonably light and not bad to carry, noticeably lighter than similar products from the same manufacturer from just two years ago. The screen is bright and vivid and pleasant to look at and touch. The screen's behavior is responsive and feels much more alive and zippy than  better, more expensive tablets from other manufacturers running the same software, so I'm guessing Asus did a really great job of optimizing the touch screen driver.\n\nThe keyboard, being small and thin, isn't wonderful but it's better than I expected it to be given its constraints. I wouldn't want to use it for my constant, everyday typing, and if I had to use this as my main computer I'd get a bluetooth keyboard that's larger and feels better to use, but the device's keyboard is plenty good for on-the-go, relatively smaller amounts of typing.\n\nI tend to leave the trackpad disabled and just use the touch screen, but it works fine if you want it.\n\nI wish it had a camera on the back, instead of just a video conferencing camera. That's my only real complaint aside from that Windows 8 isn't perfect, and is the reason I'm giving it four stars instead of five."}

Guess I got this old version a couple of weeks ago but then again it was 300 bucks total from another online dealer  (no 10% Calif sales tax added on like with Amazon.)\n\nI never owned a cell phone and bought a Dell Venue 8 Android tablet mainly for travel. Loved the tablet feel itself but didn't like Android and the whole apps thing. It seems like it takes 4 steps to do anything and  I never mastered the swiping thing. I didn't like the tablet view of websites or the screen keyboard. Worst of all there was no Flash allowed on jelly bean. I tend to listen to a lot of archived FM shows and they all use Flash. I couldn't get it side loaded and the browsers that supposedly (Puffin, Firefox) had it didn't work that well if at all. In short I was wishing for a Windows system.\n\nI considered getting a Dell Pro but it didn't have a HDMI port which I wanted to connect to my TV. For a little more this also came with a key board. Got this and boned up on Windows 8.1, since I'm an XP user. I really like this tablet which I'm using more as a netbook I'm not using the app side at all. I installed Classic Shell to make it a little more familiar. I'm considering selling my Dell venue on Craigslist. Who needs apps?"}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "The more I use this device, the less I like it.  It is under-powered and over-designed -- but the real problem is that it just doesn't feel finished.  I don't know if it's the Asus operating system or Windows 8, but it can be extremely difficult to get this thing to perform basic functions.  At times the on-screen keyboard pops on for no reason -- even if the integrated keyboard is plugged in.  The touch-screen functions just don't seem to work -- or they have unpredictable and unwanted results.  I made the mistake of going on an extended business trip with this as my only laptop, and I've ended up having to rely on my Samsung phone for most of my online interactions.\n\nWhen I first starting using the Transformer a month ago, I thought that the quirks in the operating system were things I would figure out as part of the normal learning curve.  After a month of daily use, I am no closer to smooth operation.  The operating system(s) aren't intuitive, logical or well integrated."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "First, let me say, I love my ASUS, it's a very valuable proposition, I've had it since Mid-April before my trip to SE Asia for 5 weeks.\n\nPros:\n1- Great battery life, with normal use, you can probably use for a week before you need to charge. That being said, I don't use it as my main machine.\n2- Lightweight, you can bring in a backpack and barely know it's there, it also gives you a confident feel that it's not flimsy.\n3- Flash drive is so quick to start and turn off! It's a huge difference, I'm glad I got the small capacity with a flash drive.\n4- Touch screen is very responsive, and Windows 8.1 is acceptable to use as an OS. I'm not the biggest 8.1 fan, I inmediately go to the desktop mode.\nCons:\n1- Ridiculously, this laptop only charges fully with the ASUS charger, from what I read, it's something about the data cables in the USB been disabled for it to charge at 2.1A, this is a big deal, and such a shame that it totally makes this laptop less mobile. Especially, when traveling, this seems to be such an inconvenience! You can't charge with a car adaptor, or with a tablet adaptor. The best you get is a trickle charge that never charges the device to a 100%, it just maintain charge.\n2- Flimsy keyboard.\n3- USB input hard to plug in, Maybe the location of the plug or don't know, but this method looks better on paper, obviously it's handy cos you can use any plug, but it's sometimes problematic.\n4- I wish that the screen would be foldable, but 90% of the time, I use as a laptop, the tablet function is not that big of deal."}

I did what the other reviewers said and turned the updates to 'I choose when to download them' as well. The only problems I had were: 1) I wasn't able to connect to the internet during set up, and I was worried at first but I could later on in the desktop page. 2) There was no instruction manual for how to work Windows 8.1, so I was clueless and had to watch some tutorials online. For someone who just wants to turn on a computer and go it would be difficult but if you enjoy learning new technology it won't take long and I like Windows 8 a lot now. 3) I expected this based on the reviews and it is minor, but wish the keyboard was a little heavier to balance out the tablet part better.\nBut so far so good!

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "There are thousands of reviews for this, so mine will most likely get buried. Many reviews discuss the glitches and problems with this ASUS, but honestly, I've had it for over a month now and I absolutely love it.\n\nGENERAL: I bought this for college - having a full version of Microsoft Student is really awesome. The price is really great for a transformer. Having it be a solid state drive, AKA, a tablet, means that breaking it or having a screw or hinge become loose is impossible. That means it will last longer than a year and a half. There is no fan to overheat, which is awesome.\n\nBATTERY: Depending on what you do on the tablet, the battery life varies. But generally it lasts and entire day of constant use, or several days of inconsistent use. The battery life is perfectly fine.\n\nMEMORY: The memory, despite being small, is actually just fine. No, you probably can't run Skyrim, but if you're buying something like this, I can't imagine you're looking for a gaming computer. I can run Adobe Photoshop, Terraria, Battleblock Theater, and other similar programs and games with the system doing just fine. I was actually surprised. I've had laptops in the past that couldn't even handle those programs.\n\nHARD DRIVE: After setting up the tablet and installing Student 2013, there is about 25 Gigs left in the hard drive, which seems small, but is perfectly fine for someone like me. Don't go downloading gigs of porn or music and you'll be fine - or do, doesn't matter to me.\n\nSIZE: It is very lightweight, and I carry it in my bookbag with no problem. The screen is actually a decent size for being practically a tablet.\n\nKEYBOARD: The dock that comes with it is actually really great. The way the tablet clicks into the dock is very sturdy and it doesn't seem like it will wear out very quickly. It's strong, and the hinge doesn't move far back enough that if it DOES break, you won't need to find a way to support the screen to be able to see it well. So often I've had laptop hinges break and you end up trying to hold the monitor up just so you can see the dang thing.\n\nReviews have claimed keys not working and other similar problems but my keyboard works perfectly fine. No issues whatsoever. If I don't click the laptop into the dock fully, sometimes the track pad won't work, but then I realize that it's not connected completely. The dock comes with a USB on the left that is really convenient.\n\nPROS\nSurprisingly good memory, ability to run games\nLightweight\nWon't break very easily\nFull version of Student 2013\nComes with dock\nGreat for a college student, casual gamer, or just someone who needs a simple PC\nGreat price for something that works so well\nSolid State drive means it will last long\n\nCONS\nTrack pad can sometimes be annoying, but this is a minor issue\nGlitch here and there, but nothing that a restart won't fix\nSpeakers are on the back of the tablet, and this can be a nuisance when trying to hear something well, but it does have a very powerful speaker for a tablet, so it evens out in the end"}

You may need to zoom in.\n\nNow that I'm used to win 8, I'll be looking into getting the new Surface Pro 3 for more serious computing work... for the power and the larger screen.\n\nI've highly recommended this to friends who are looking to do general computing.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I migrated to this laptop from a first generation Lenovo S10 netbook that bit the dust after six years.  I travel 260+ days a year, and needed something small with a long battery life and full Windows compatibility for airport duty.  As a Netbook, I'd give this thing five stars.  Keyboard is about as useable as my last netbook, and the form factor is identical in terms of length and width, but far thinner and with a much longer battery life.  It runs full Windows 8, so program compatibility has yet to be an issue for me.  It has enough oomph to run Photoshop CS4, which is probably the most demanding application I use on a regular basis.  The screen resolution is the same as my work laptop, a Lenovo Thinkpad, so I don't have scaling issues when I design something for a work audience.  All pros.\n\nI also bought this because I was intrigued by the idea of having it as a tablet.  I've never had one before, but I wasn't thrilled with the idea of carting yet another thing around the airport.  I already travel with a personal phone, a work phone, a MiFi device, a work computer, and a laptop.  The idea of consolidating tablet and laptop into one device was very promising to me.  As a tablet, I'd give this thing three stars.  It does 80% of what I'd want a tablet to do, but I have become frustrated with several aspects of it.  You can't fault the limited apps of Windows 8 over Android to Asus, so I wouldn't rate it poorly because of that, even though it is frustrating.  I had to use the thing as a field expedient camera the other day, and the lack of a front facing camera made it difficult and unwieldy.  No GPS, so in order to use it for directions, I had to chain it to my phone.  My Bluetooth Motorola S305 headset did not play nice with the Wifi, so I had to enable Bluetooth Collaboration in the driver settings, as well switch my MiFi to a higher bandwidth to use them both at the same time.  The Virtual Keyboard often obfuscates the field I am typing in, and either does not resize the screen or dock itself to the bottom, or I haven't yet figured out how to do that.  Sometimes the physical keyboard becomes unresponsive, and I have to detatch and reset it to restore function.  I had perhaps unrealistic expectations that as a tablet, this would be about as useful as my phone, just with a different screen.  That is not to be the case.\n\nIn the end, I think this is an excellent product for the money.  It is an exceptional netbook - 5 stars.  It is an adequate tablet - 3 stars.  As an exercise in compromise, it's a four star hybrid that will do most of what you want while reducing your physical load a little bit.  So it gets a four star composite rating from me.\n\n**\n\nAs a final note, Windows 8 has not always played nice with this thing.  Despite following every bit of caution I could find on The Internet, the first Windows 8 updates I tried to install left the device hung on the 'Failed to Install Updates' screen.  Furthermore, the F8 / Shift + F8 commands The Internet recommended did not get me to the BIOS or advanced start-up options necessary to get into safe mode.  Ended up being the F1 key.  I was able to do a system restore, then manually install the updates in smaller batches.  That seemed to do the trick.  On another occassion, the thing hung on shutdown and would not restart, no matter how many times I hit the power button, or it's charge status.  Fortunately, The Internet told me to hold the volume down and power buttons for ten seconds, and that seemed to do the trick.\n\nI'm about two weeks into ownership and daily use at this point, and the teething pains have lessened considerably."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I bought an Asus Eee PC901 five years ago, mainly for travel and it's been indispensible. This is really the successor to the late lamented netbook. But things have moved on. The screen is great - bright, clear with good viewing angles. The colour balance does need adjusting - reduce the green and red a bit and tweak the gamma using the control panel tool. The keyboard is acceptable - reasonable feel and easy enough to type on, but probably on the small side for most hands. And at last you can see the point of Windows 8 - on this type of touchscreen device the interface actually works, unlike on a normal PC. Still I installed Classic Shell for when I'm using the desktop mode. Performance is good - it feels responsive, though the SSD isn't that quick. Battery life also seems OK though I've not used it for extensive periods unplugged.\nBut it's not all perfect. There's only one USB3 port in the dock - having two would allow a card reader and hard disk to be plugged in to back up photos when travelling. So I'll need to look at getting a hub. And the USB port on the tablet is only micro-USB2. Also the keyboard part is underused - there are other versions with a harddisk in there, but apart from the USB3 port there's a large metal plate to give it some weight and stop it tipping over (search to see photos of it dismantled). Adding redundant weight to a portable device is perverse - a useful counterweight would have been an extra battery. In the end this is a low cost device so it would be churlish to complain about these minor issues with an otherwise excellent bit of kit."}

The keypad connection seems to be a little intermittent, in that it stops sometimes, but a little pressing down or jiggling seems to fix it.  After reading several reviews, and watching a few youtude demos, I decided to get the 64Gig version and then pick up my own USB 3 hard drive.  however after reading about most of the external USB 3 hard disks available, I found that they were powered from the USB port of the PC they were attached to.  I was not at all sure that this would work, since the USB port of this Transformer is located on the keyboard, which dose not have its own power source. What I ended up doing was buying a larger, and more expensive self powered USB 3 external hard drive.\n  As I am typing this review, I find it very difficult, because the cursor keeps getting misplaced by my accidentally hitting the ENTER key instead of the right SHIFT key.  I am used to typing often with my right hand only and this keyboard is not designed for that.\n  Also, I am old and I have difficulty seeing the tiny type on this small screen.\nThe bottom line is, that I wish I had just purchased a lap top, with a bigger screen, keyboard, and internal hard drive and DVD burner.  I bought this as a way to get the added security of Windows 8.1 at a low price.  It does that, but\ni had questions about the hard drive if it would get trashed, if the key board were accidentally unplugged from it`s power source, the screen/pad.  As USB thumb drives need to be \"ejected\" prior to being unplugged, wouldn`t the same be true of a USB hard drive?  I could not find a readily available answer.\n  I have used the 64 GIG pad once by itself and it worked well.\n  This ASUS TRANSFORMER is my first dealing with Windows 8.1, and as with serveral other reviewers, I have had and am having trouble with updates.  I have so far had to reset my MSN/Windows 8.1 password 3 times.  This requires internet access from a different PC because one can not get past the LOGIN screen on this one.  I suspect that some of the problem might be that it tried to install an update and the battery discharged during the update.  I thought that I had done as suggested by another reviewer, and set them to only update when I asked, but guess I did not understand that one should apparently always leave this device plugged into a charger when not in use. I read that update problems are not limited to this machine, and would suggest to MicroSoft that their update programs always inform the end user to plug their\nPC into a good power source prior to starting an update.  With tablet devices often left on, because they use very limited battery power when the screen is off,  Microsoft, should always check the power source of the device, and not start an update unless the device is being charged (plugged into the AC power).\n  The Transformer had reported that it had installed several updates, but kept failing the more recent ones. I did a maintenance troubleshooting program from the control panel, and now it says that none have been installed, but several are ready?  We`ll see what happens.  I suspect that much of the problem is my lack of recent Windows programs exteriance, but so far I am not enjoying my windows 8.1 experience."}

Asus, being a real Windows computer gives me a chance to have both- my portable toy AND a working computer.  Everyone seems to want to buy a keyboard or cover for their tablets anyway, this has a nice sturdy detachable built in.  Plus, this offer has a kicker of coming with Student Office.

The only three concerns I have with this computer are: (1) the charger and the charger port are similar to the cellphone chargers and with that it mind, I've seen many cell phones over the years lose their capability of charging because the port becomes too easily damaged. Also, the charger cord is just WAY TO SHORT. The extension should be at least 7 feet long. However, the battery amazingly stays charged for days with what I do, so no harm no foul. (2) not enough hard drive space. However, for what I do--study, write, study, write, write, write . . . it's perfect. (3) The mouse pad and left and right mouse buttons seem to be too difficult to use. At times the pad is not sensitive enough, while the buttons take to much of a tap to get them to respond. It might just be me, but I'm afraid that I might break them. Either way, once you get used to the amount of pressure needed to get them to respond the mouse pad and buttons do fine."}

We bought it as an additional unit for our Elementary/Middle School kids to use for school work, online learning etc. The price can't be beat, it's a full functioning Windows unit, with touch screen/tablet use as well, fully loaded with the Office Suite. I looked at a variety of options: Chromebook, Surface tablet, Macbook Air, inexpensive Windows laptops and this was the best option I found.\n\nThe keyboard is smaller and kind of plasticky; it's fine for the kids bcs they have smaller hands, I don't use it that often but when I do it I it takes a little bit to get used to the smaller size (if you remember the netbooks of yore, it's similar). I don't think it's going to break from overuse. If you mistreat your electronics, they will break .\n\nThe best part of it is the full MS Office suite and that it is full Windows 8.1 (not RT or 8, which you see on a lot of the other 2-in-1 devices and Tablets). It's Windows, so their App store isn't the best, but has most of the things we wanted to add to it, and what it didn't have you can access via the Web. I wouldn't buy a Windows Tablet over an Apple or Android version, but I view this primarily as a computer.\n\nBattery life is good, but you do need to remember to charge it. It charges pretty quickly.\n\nGreat additional little computer if you need something inexpensive, full functioning, etc."}

After looking about at all that ASUS, MS and DELL had to offer for some time, I finally decided to get a tablet. After reading the reviews, I decided that this is what I wanted.\n\nPros: Battery Life, 64 GB SSD, Quad CPU, Keyboard, Resolution.\nCons: Keyboard will need to be sent back due to the shift key causing a disconnect. Mouse still works though. Have to hit the transform button to dis/reconnect to get the letters back.\nEDIT: Keyboard started working about 2 weeks after I bought it. Maybe an update fixed it, I don't really know.\n\nAdded a 128GB USB3 thumbdrive to the purchase so I don't have to fill up the onboard SSD. And the microSD added another 32 that I flip flop with my camera for editing my photo gallery. Very easy to do.\n\nAfter reading some reviews, I decided to rather happen sooner than later, I updated everything I could. OS, Office, ASUSfw, Apps,  Security, Important... doesn't matter, EVERYTHING. The scared factor of running without security is too great. And then there is the problem with \"What if there is an issue with this thing and I accidentally update date it 16 months from now?\".  No issues other than me trying to do too many at 1 time. (all of them) It would get some and bomb, get some more and bomb. When I settled down and just told it to get Security updates, that went fine. Then moved on to the next and that also went fine. Then over to ASUS to update the Firmware, did fine. Then all the apps. 18 out of 21 on the 1st pass, then got the 3 stragglers on the next.\n\nSo far I have used this at work and home and on the road. No trouble connecting to any WiFi no matter what security is there. Have streamed video from my desktop and have hooked up the mini HDMI and streamed to my TV. I have also paired this with bluetooth to both my laptop and my car for streaming music from the thumb drive. So far I have yet to find any faults with this system.\n\nIf anything happens, or I feel the need to update further, I will be editing this. But as for now, I am extremely happy with this purchase.\n\nUPDATE: 2 1/2 months later and still working great. I still run all the Windows updates. Have not seen any newer ASUS updates since that 1st batch. Seeing that the newer models are coming out, I am not sure if reading this is viable anymore, but I will continue to update when I feel it is worth noting.\n\nUPDATE #2: Keyboard no longer has any trouble. Not sure what happened, it just started working."}

I purchased it to have a small, compact machine I could use for business and pleasure instead of a bulky laptop. I had to return two of these units. Both for the same reason, Internet Explorer. A message would pop up that I may need this program to run properly. Even though I indicated I didn't want it, it would automatically download and want to charge me a fee for the service. I tried to remove the program and IE was removed too, leaving me a blank screen. I returned the transformer, was sent a new one and the same thing happened again. I tried one more time, and never touched IE, but downloaded \"google chrome\" and now the machine works fine. My only disappointment is certain apps can't be downloaded with window 8. I opened the Kindle app, and found, while I can read my books, I cannot view any of the movies I have saved on my Kindle Fire, which I thought I would be able to do. So, after 3 trys, I finally am satisfied with the transformer. More than satisfied with Amazons customer service. They were great, knowledgable and patient.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I bought mine in June, 2014 and it worked fine in all departments. I had just about read all the reviews and was glad to have found none of the problems listed. My guess is that ASUS is correcting a lot of these problems as they continue to put this popular device on the market. I have bought motherboards and other electronic parts from ASUS and I am very satisfied with their response and care of their customers.\n\nMany people are calling the built cheap because it is plastic, but this is a solidly built device that should withstand a lot of usage.\n\nOne thing that I find negative is the design of the power button which is a bad design. It is hard to use because it is flushed with the top left edge of the tablet and sometimes one has to fidget with it until one makes a proper turn on push. I suspect that this is the cause of the problem for many of the folks who say that they have turned the table off and then are not able to turn it back on. Also, it feels awkward to use a full fledged OS for working on such a small tablet when such a sized screen is more adoptable to a tablet version of the OS. So for me who blazes through the Windows OS, I find it somewhat constraining. Of course, this might be different for other folks.\n\nOther than this, it is a bargain that should be scooped up because sooner or later it will disappear. For the exceptional value in hardware and price it gets my 5-star rating."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "As others have pointed out - the two small metal bar \"legs\" on back of the keyboard hinge that contact your desk will definitely leave permanent indentations and scuffs/scratches - I'm amazed how many are on mine after just a few hours use. Do yourself a favor and put something between it and your desk!\n\nI already knew to expect the traditional Asus \"rubber-flex\" keyboard - that is, it bends and flexes way too much under even light typing but otherwise this is a pretty decent tablet. No iPad Air or fast Android tablet performance can be had with this and I do find the response time a bit sluggish for me but certainly not a deal killer as just a web browser or to punch out a quick document.\nComing from Windows 7 - and absolutely staying there after experiencing Windows 8.1 - I appreciate the touch features and interface but it's a real Microsoft miss in my opinion and fails to be intuitive or to get out of the way and let me work. I hate the default screen but my kids far prefer it to a boring Windows 7 desktop.\n\nBottom line - for the price and considering the software included, if you want to try Windows 8 but don't want to commit on your daily machines, this is a great way to take it for a spin and get acclimated to it. Great for sitting on the couch at night and browsing or light work. The price is right too - you can't buy full Office and Windows 8 alone for much less if any.\n\nUPDATE - 28 June 2014 ***********************************************\nAfter a week or so of use I find myself reaching for this cool little tablet/keyboard a lot instead of the various other laptops, tablets. I use an iPad Air mostly and a Samsung 2014 Edition Galaxy Note along with Mac Book Air and Pro. I use a custom built desktop for work during the day. But this tablet is becoming my favorite to read, browse and work on documents at night and to take home from the office. Again it's nothing extraordinary but I really am enjoying using it. It's been a lot of fun getting Windows 8.1 working the way I like it on the Asus and after tuning it all up a bit, I can really use this easily.\n\nAs for Windows 8.1 I also like it now. It's nowhere near as bad as people (like me) have been insisting and you quickly get to like just reaching up to touch your selection on-screen instead of hitting the mouse for every input. But only with a touch screen device - I can't see much point using Windows 8.1 with a traditional display using just a mouse. Definitely add a quick Sandisk 32 or 64 GB MicroSD card to this - much of the system 64 GB is used for Asus stuff and Office, Windows usual endless updates.\nThe USB port works perfectly with our Logitech G602 and other mice as well as USB 2/s storage external drives.\nSo for the excellent low price you can't really go wrong with this - I am pretty picky about the equipment I use and getting effective, consistent performance enjoyably from especially the electronics we buy. This isn't the best tablet but it's totally honest and doesn't pretend to be anything else. It has all most people will want especially as a secondary machine or for a young student and factually you can do a surprising amount of work with it. It no longer feels too slow or sluggish - even using the increasingly bloated, intrusive Chrome for web stuff. It's a perfect machine on which to learn/try Windows 8.1 and it has me thinking seriously about adding a Surface Pro 3 or touchscreen laptop etc to our office soon.\n\nThe only big con - charging takes forever so yes, get a higher output charger but even that didn't make a huge difference for me.\n\nNice work Asus - this one is a winner, outstanding price too."}

I was a little disappointed by the quality of the tablet itself. There are sharp plastic edges around the tablet and the plastic creaks. I expected better from ASUS. My TF700 has a smooth metallic feel to it. The price is comparable to what you get. I have owned several windows tablets and this one is light, thin and fast...finally. It is a nice bonus that the keyboard is included but it doesn't have an extra battery like my TF700. The battery lasts 10 hours and the screen is bright and clear. I don't like the micro USB charger connector as it is difficult to plug into the side of the tablet. The keyboard is smaller than a regular keyboard but it is still usable. I don't like the touch pad, so I use an external mouse. I had trouble using a blue tooth mouse because it caused the wi-fi card to lose connection to my access point and it was difficult to get it back to normal. It required disabling the wi-fi card and then re-enabling it."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I bought this to handle files from my computer done with the Win7  OS.  I'm a bit shaky in using  Win 8.1 that is installed on the Transformer, but I'm Learning.  I think it will turn out to be a good OS eventually. In spite of this, the T100 performs beautifully. I've had it now for about 3 weeks and am gradually setting it up for my needs, apps, etc... I now know how to handle the favorites and pin them...etc. The trackpad is responsive, quick and precise. When docked, the user must make sure the tablet part is well inserted in the center contact pin. The resolution is that of an IPad 2. It isn't the retina quality, but it is most satisfying. Gee, it's a steal at the price (64 Gb and Home and Student version of Office 2013)! Amazon delivered right on the dot! So I love my T100 and I think you will too if you get one. Too bad there isn't a good rear camera on the tablet. One great improvement however, would be to have a mini usb port instead of a micro usb port on the tablet. Also, I find the insertion of the charging unit a bit unwieldy, but that doesn't bring down my 5 stars. Battery life is great also.  Yep! great combination!  Like anything electronic, my only wish is that it will be durable."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "Under product description, the claim is that student word comes pre-installed but you still have to activate it and download. This will take up additional storage space. Arguably significant since the device comes with about 14gb free storage out of about 28gb available. In addition, all the updates you need when you first turn on the tablet on takes up a whole of space too.\n\nI purchased the 32gb with the dock so all I really need is a micro SD card. Depending on how much storage you'd like, maybe go with the 64gb model and a mirco SD card.\n\nI also don't like that I need to buy a micro SD card. And yes, cloud is a wonderful alternative and it's convenient, but not my thing. Plus, that's why I purchased this with the extra storage in the keyboard dock. Because I though I'd be able to more conveniently transfer, even automatically transfer (when appropriate), data from the tablet to the dock. For some odd reason, in order to transfer data I need the micro SD card. In other words, I cannot directly transfer data from the tablet to the dock. And, that's annoying.\n\nOn a positive note, the t100 is a very capable device. It can run a split screen without any hesitation and have several tabs open without freezing up. In my opinion, the resolution is decent and the sound is good. Battery life is good too. I bought this for school and it should do well. Won't be doing any heavy editing but tasks like researching, typing, etc.\n\nA lot of reviews hate on the plastic, but I don't mind it. Doesn't feel cheap. Does feel a bit heavy though. The keyboard is a bit small so will take some getting used to, depending on the size of your hands."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "This is the perfect tablet if you're a Windows fan and want to be able to use all Windows Apps. This runs a with lightning fast Quad-Core Intel Atom processor, which allows for full Windows (32-bit), not Windows RT. So you can use the apps in the Windows store but when you need to, you can switch to the desktop and use all of your standard windows programs without issue.\n\nThe 64 GB solid-state drive has about 35 GB free to use for storage and there is a MicroSD slot for additional data storage. The tablet also has a Micro USB 2.0 slot (you charge through this also) and an mini-HDMI slot. Also has standard headphone jack.\n\nIt also comes with a full version of Office (Word, Powerpoint, Excel and OneNote).\n\nAs a tablet, it works great. The touch screen is nicely responsive. It's light (lighter than an iPad 4) and feels comfortable in hand. For apps, the Windows store has a lot of apps that run in the \"Metro\" style start screen. Surf the web, check your mail, look in on Facebook, read a book. It's all there.\n\nThe tablet itself also has a Micro USB 2.0 slot (you charge through this also) and an mini-HDMI slot. Also has standard headphone jack.\n\nAs a mini notebook, the keyboard it comes with works nicely. The touch pad is a bit finicky, but you get used to it. The KB dock also has a USB 3.0 slot, so you can connect a wireless mouse or USB Storage. And as I said, it's full Windows 8.1 so it runs any Windows program, not just RT Metro Apps.\n\nThe battery life is excellent. I've gone 24 hours with normal use and it has still had some life left. I haven't run it through a harsh test like continuous video, but I can see the battery lasting through a few videos on a long plane ride.\n\nSpeaking of video, it is very crisp and clear. The resolution is great and I've watched a few sample videos without any complaints.\n\nOf course I also have to mention audio. The sound it pretty nice. The speakers are on the back but the sound is fine. Very clear. No complaints.\n\nSo if you don't want to shell out big $$$ for an iPad, this is a perfect alternative especially when you consider that it has a keyboard dock, USB expansion AND is full Windows WITH MS Office included.\n\nYou really can't go wrong with it!"}

Windows 8 does not have the same games you may be used to on Android or Apple devices, but they do have some free games that are good. Also most paid games allow a free trial to decide if you want it.\nI like that my son has his own account on here and that he can do a picture password instead of words since he is only 5 and sometimes he stays up and plays while I sleep.

It goes into sleep without warning and requires a reboot to get it to work again. There are times when the operating system has a lot of lag (probably a Windows problem, not an ASUS problem). Also, the charger gets really hot. Like too hot to even touch.  Makes me kind of nervous to charge it.  Also, when researching, I noticed a lot of reviewers commenting on it being a fingerprint magnet.  I thought that was kind of overkill, but once I got mine I realized they weren't being overly critical.  It's not just kind of bad, it's really bad.  If everything else on the computer was perfect, I still might have considered returning it just for that because it was almost impossible to keep the screen clean.

Even with a full battery charge, web browsing was sluggish and would mostly hang when the tablet operated on battery power.  This was regardless of the browser I used (IE, Chrome, FF).  Once I plugged the power cord back in, web surfing speed was restored immediately.  I checked all power saving settings to see if this was simply by design to save battery power.  A call to Asus confirmed this \"feature\" was actually a bug.  I found Asus customer service and tech support to be very good.  They offered free shipment to their facility to troubleshoot the issue and fix (hopefully).  Since the unit was less than a week old, I opted to simply return the device to Amazon for a full refund (a process that was very simple to navigate).\n\nOther than that I have no complaints.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I found myself in a bit of a predicament when both my laptop and netbook died, when I landed on this T100 rather randomly. I went to Walmart to buy a computer, of course the two I wanted were not in stock, but I wanted a computer that day. I'm also on a tight budget. After literally looking at my options and doing product research in store for almost two hours I went with transformer T100. I was however skeptical because I read some unfavorable reviews on here, as well as many good ones..  Personally as far as setup went it wasn't bad (if you have a long micro USB cord use it)  leave it plugged in for at least 8 hours as this takes awhile to charge anyways. After hours of tedious updates (because as I read on here not to auto update) I had a full functioning computer. (minus an optical drive) I already have a live account because I have a Windows Phone so literally entering my email address did a lot for me.  Two days later I'm still learning my full version of Windows 8.1 but both the OS and the T100 have really impressed me. The screen looks great it runs very quickly, my only complaint is the connector on the base seems to be a bit cheap. Use care and always grab it at the base when using the keyboard. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants a quality tablet with a proper OS, anyone considering Surface or anyone considering a laptop. Add a few peripherals such as a USB external hard drive or DVD burner and an SD card and I believe you should be happy with the T100. I look very forward to enjoying this arguably better than the expensive Surface transformer T100 for some time to come."}

Now onto the review this review is not here to cover hardware but instead I am focusing on software from artist perspective coming from the iPad.\n\nI wanted to give this a shot and make sure it could do what I needed before leaving my review of it. I decided on the transformer for a few reasons, I was one of the first iPad gen 1 owners while I love the iPad it really aggravated me that after a little over 4 years and $100s  spent even though the iPad was perfectly fine 90% of my applications I relied on daily stopped working.\n\nWhy you might ask ? Because apple stopped supporting it. they updated the operating system for the newer devices like the iPad 2 leaving behind the IPad 1 and eventually all the apps updated to the newer operating system which caused everything I had to be left behind and eventually slowing down or crashing or just all together not working. Uninstalling the application to try and fix the issue resulted in a error message saying \"application can not be installed it requires OS \"insert #here\"\n\nI used the iPad for a lot of art applications as well as word processing and some light gaming & email. I have a friend who works for Microsoft and he has been onto me for a while to try out a windows tablet and after testing the water with Android and realizing it is just not the platform for a artist more of a setting for hackers & a social media enthusiast I decided to jump in and with his advice give the Transformer a try.\n\nComing over from the iPad it took about a week of just messing around with it to really get used to it, the hardest part was tracking down applications and software that did what I needed. When I say applications and software please understand I mean just that applications and software.\n\nThis is a tablet yes but the keyboard is not just a dock, because this is a full on PC which means you have the windows 8 app store as well as a full on Desktop PC so my first attempt was trying out all the apps for editing Photography/ Painting in the Windows 8 app store.\n\nWindows 8 apps are not as refined as iPad apps as far as art or editing goes. not as accurate or detailed But I did find a few worth keeping and Fresh Paint in the windows store is a keeper it is a pretty detailed application minus layers you can do a lot with this one and for a free application with so many options I can not knock it. Autodesk Sketchbook pro  is also a good one, more for drawing sketching and building rather than painting it is a great option to add to your tool set.\n\nYou do have the standard photo editing with filters, but one thing that annoyed me the most the way they are implemented with a full filter as in there is no spot filtering meaning if you filter a image the entire image gets filtered with no other options. I feel pretty safe in saying this is a standard because I spent a entire week's evenings going from app to app.\n\nBut on the good side and the saving grace is the desktop. I am able to run a full suite of PhotoShop and tracked down my favorite paint software ArtRage the full PC suites as well as Xara Photography software all on the Transformer and run them with no issues what so ever.\n\nWhich makes me more thrilled and happy than I would have been just running mobile applications alone. the options are here on windows 8 which can be overwhelming at first because you just don't know where to start. But in my case running full suites allows me a lot more options than I would have ever had on Apple and to top it all off the Transformer came with a license for a full version of Microsoft Office 2013 so my word processing ? A complete non issue !\n\nWith Microsoft Office which includes OneNote I have put it to use, my wife and myself now have the OneNote apps on our Android phones I also added the Office app on my devices.  With me upgrading all 3 of our PC'S to Windows 8 which all sync to our One drive cloud service. We are connected,  my wife can leave me a note to pick up something before I come home or a reminder about a dr appointment.  Which automatically syncs to all devices so I can't miss it.\n\nI write out a document in office on the transformer or pc send it to my one drive and when I get home or or to the Office I can pick it back up print it or finish it.\n\nOnedrive is actually pretty reasonable in price compared to the rest like dropbox. $25 dollars for one year I grabbed up 50 GB of storage.  Which is way more than enough for my family,  the interesting thing is I transferred about 35 GB of data from dropbox to onedrive and in onedrive it only consumed 15 GB I am assuming that either Microsoft compacts the data or dropbox boats it. Either way I am happy with it."}

Thankfully, I am able to dedicate overnight charging to this thing for 8 hours of work the next day while using a desktop at the house.\n\nI should note that it took me several overnight charges for the battery to sort itself out when I first received the PC, I was worried I had received a dud but after a couple of 8+ hour charges without fully battery charge it has been working perfectly ever since."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I could go on and on about how much I love this tablet / laptop! I actually purchased this after spending 3 months trying to convince myself that the $550 dollars I had spent on a Samsung Galaxy Note was worth it. In the end, I just couldn't do it. Android is great for my phone, and If all I wanted to do on a 10 inch+ device was consume media content and play games, then the Note would've been a great device (actually probably overkill), but I need more from something I can't carry in my pocket.\n\nSo my search began, my criteria:\n- Full Windows\n- Office Included\n- Dockable Keyboard\n- Fast load times\n- Able to handle complex Excel Spreadsheets\n- Quality display for consuming media\n- USB Port\n- Long Battery Life\n- All of the above for under $600\n\nThis was the only product I found that met all my criteria. After reading through several product reviews all over the web, I was still skeptical. Several folks had complained about keyboard / mouse issues, others about charging. Then I found others that said if you just follow the initial set-up procedure, are patient with letting it charge fully the first time, and you download all the updates then you'll be quite happy.\n\nI decided to take a chance, and ordered one. Once I had a chance to un-box it, I did as others (and the instructions) recommended and let it charge fully.\n\n40 or so days later, I have no complaints whatsoever! This product is fantastic, and well worth the price, especially when you start comparing it to the other options you have under $600. I will admit that Windows 8 is has taken some getting used to, but it's been no more of a learning curve than learning Android for the first time, and I'm starting to appreciate some of the new features. When I'm docked in the keyboard, I find myself still using Windows just like I do on my Windows 7 Laptop at work, but when undocked, the tile format of Windows 8 works great.\n\nThe device itself is fast, lightweight, and does exactly what I need it to do. It's nice having a full USB port, although I wish it were on the tablet itself. I love the keyboard! The display is fantastic, and personally I see no real difference between the display of this and the display I had with my Note. To be fair, I'm not a guy who has to have the sharpest, latest, most amazing TV when I'm watching something. As long it's clear and not lagging, I'm happy. This device is great for me with no complaints on the video watching end, and I've had several running at once.\n\nPerformance wise, this device does exactly what I need it to. I work in Excel often, with complex spreadsheets with lookup formulas, and statistical add-ins. This device handles them without issue.\n\nHands down, this is one of the best purchases I've ever made."}

There are plenty of complaints, but at this time I can't add to them. I purchased the 65GB and have enjoyed every second of working on it. I got it for the portability and because it included Microsoft Office. The keyboard is small, but I've seen smaller. It's easy to get used to and I'm finding that typing on it now is not problem. I love the touchscreen too. I'm even surprised by how much I like Windows 8. It's perfect for what I need, and it was extremely affordable. If things change, I will revise the review.\n\nADD: Two years later and I'm still using it.

This isn't my main computer, but I really love it and am glad I bought it."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I purchased this computer in order to replace two PCs I currently use: a desktop at work and a laptop at home. Both are old machines running Windows Xp and Office 2000. The idea was to leave the keyboard dock at work connected with a large monitor, standard keyboard, mouse, and LAN cable. I would commute from home to work with just the tablet, which would be my sole computer at home. In this way, I would upgrade both the hardware and software of two PCs and would avoid the synchronization problems between them.\nSo I bought a USB hub with a LAN Network Adapter, a Micro HDMI to HDMI cable, and a 64 Gb microSD memory card. On the work side everything works fine: I have a much faster computer running Office 2013 on a large 1920x1080 monitor and continue using my existing keyboard and mouse. On the home side the situation is more complicated. The tablet screen is great and the virtual keyboard works fine. However, I have a hard time learning to use Office with a finger instead of a mouse. With older software the situations becomes even more difficult. The solution I found is to use a Micro USB to USB OTG adapter and a small mouse. The tablet then behaves just as if it was connected to the dock and all programs, old and new, become usable. However, the tablet must then be used on a table.\nThe only hardware problem I had is that the screen autorotation suddenly stopped working. Windows reports that the sensor was disconnected because of a problem. This is not a big deal to me because the automatic screen rotation is more of a distraction than an advantage: when needed, the screen can be rotated pressing a key combination. Anyway, this problem is the reason for a 4 star rating."}

I have large hands and the really small right shift key was missed most of the time. The keyboard flex was disconcerting. Bottom line, too many typing mistakes and a real detraction from usability.\n\nI found the charging performance really bad to the point of being unacceptable. Even when plugged in with the Asus adapter and cable the battery drains if you have the device turned on. The only way I found to reliably charge it up was to turn it completely off and even then it takes forever (8 hours?).

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I purchased the T100 because of ASUS' reputation for solid computer hardware. My goals were to come up-to-speed on the Windows 8.1 operating environment (which is VERY different from Win XP and 7) and to determine whether I would find a tablet handy in addition to my laptop and smartphone.  The T100 accomplished both goals, and there is a place for tablets in addition to the other two devices.\n\nI purchased the version with a 64GB solid-state disk drive - not a mechanical drive.  I definitely don't recommend purchasing a smaller drive (the 32Gb version) because you'll want the available space for apps and data.  The absence of a mechanical drive makes the tablet lighter, quieter, and it produces less heat.\n\nI added a 64Gb SANDisk (also purchased from Amazon) in the microSD slot to increase data storage capacity.  It's a cheap way to double your storage space.\n\nThe dockable keyboard is a useful bonus.  Many tablets require you to buy it separately.  It is adequate for the task.  I find the keyboard useful for occasions where I need to type substantial amounts of information, and for running apps that aren't well designed for touch-screen use.  (There are more of those than I expected.)\n\nThe display screen is clear and bright, adjustable to your personal preference.  I recommend also buying a screen protector if you use it in touch-screen mode most of the time, as I do.  Note that if you purchase a screen protector, you'll need to take extra care when docking and undocking the keyboard.  The first time I did this, the keyboard bent and scratched the protector.  There isn't a lot of extra room in the docking connectors.\n\nThe operating speed is as fast as I could want.  ASUS' higher-powered CPU is definitely is a plus.\n\nMy version came with Microsoft Office 2013 Student included, another nice bonus from ASUS.  Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote.  If you're accustomed to using Microsoft Outlook, as I am, it's not in the package.  I recommend using Microsoft Mail instead on your tablet.  It's better designed for touch-screen use anyhow.\n\nAs with all new PC purchases, you'll spend a lot of time initially downloading patches and fixes to Windows and Office, plus downloading and installing apps from the Microsoft Store or other sites.\n\nThe T100 came with a solid internal Wi-Fi dual band adapter.  I had no problem connecting to either Wi-Fi band in my home, and it seems to have a good range (better than an HP laptop I own).\n\nBattery life is as-advertised ... about 8-9 hours of continual use and longer if it is sleeping.  It recharges quickly with the included power adapter.\n\nASUS provides a separate update checker for its own products.  It alerted me to a new firmware version, which installed without problems (always a little scary if the update fails in-progress).\n\nThe only issue I've found (and others have documented) is that the power-on button is sometimes unpredictable.  That is, sometimes the tablet turns on almost immediately when you depress it, and sometimes it takes maybe 5-10 seconds.  This is apparently a BIOS issue, according to what I've read.  So long as you know that sometimes you have to keep the power button depressed for longer than usual (until you see the camera LED), however, it has always booted-up for me.\n\nThe tablet has a user-facing camera, but not dual cameras (one on the back side) - which is a disadvantage if you want to use your tablet to take photos or videos.  I hope ASUS fixes this in a future version.  But the included camera is fine for Skype sessions and such.\n\nOverall, I think this is a wonderful tablet for the money and I'm happy I bought it."}

I followed the instructions, plugged it into the charger and waited. When I finally booted the system, I configured the PC. Everything looked great, but the keypad would not work. I tried connecting and disconnecting, booting and rebooting--nothing. Eventually, I looked on line, read the entire owner's manual, and then made the biggest mistake, I called ASUS customer service.\n\nI was not on hold long. When I explained my problem to the tech, she told me to plug in the keyboard and let it charge. Huh? There is no outlet to charge the keyboard, there was no \"power cord\" to charge the keyboard, and as far as anyone can tell, there is no battery in the keyboard. I waited on hold for a bit, she came back and changed the question I had asked, said that different models to the Transformer book had different specs, so mine, because it was built in 2013, did not have a charger for the keypad. When it became clear that she did not know what she was talking about, I asked to talk to a supervisor. She refused to let me, told me I could return the product to Amazon or send it to the company. If I sent it, a brand new computer, for repair, I could expect to wait 5 days to several weeks for the computer to be returned. Wow! I was not happy and ended the phone conversation.\n\nI called back, wanting to talk to a supervisor. This time I got R. on the phone. He told me no supervisors were available since everyone of them was in a meeting. Convenient... By that point, I was understandably upset, and my ire increased when he told me \"You were told you could return the product. I do not know why you are upset?\" Really? Eventually he stopped talking to me, left the line open so I could hear all of the background conversation--obviously outsourced outside of the US--and then he ended the call, sending me to a phone survey about the experience.\n\nI am returning the product to Amazon, less my $11 for return shipping and my 13$ screen protector fees for two reasons. Why would I want a product that comes defective and why would I want to deal with a company that has such poor customer service and does not care one bit about customer satisfaction. If you do not mind dealing with people who do not care about the product, the company, or the customer, order the product. Otherwise, find a better bargain for your dollars."}

(I want everything on the tablet itself!)\n\nWhy have an ipad or other non-Windows tablet when you can have it all on this wonderful device, which is a tablet or laptop at will - the keyboard pops on and off in a second. Its 10-inch screen is larger than an ipad or kindle 8.9, though a similar weight (1.2 lbs). Although it has a touchpad, I rarely use it - touching the screen takes the place of moving and clicking the mouse. (To right-click, hold the touch longer.) If there are several selections close together, your finger may seem too large to select the one you want, but as long as your touch is centered on the selection it will work. (Or use a capacitive-touch stylus.)\n\nI use this wonderful wifi tablet for email, shopping, googling, and even real work when away from my desktop. For folks who don't like Windows 8.1, all you do when you see the colorful screen full of tiles (icons) is tap the Desktop tile. When on the desktop or elsewhere, to change settings or shut down, swipe inwards from the right edge of the screen (Charms) and touch Power. If you ever get \"stuck\" within Windows 8.1 screens, press alt/F4 to exit.\n\nThe 10-inch screen is great for reading PDF ebooks, such as those found on google books, internet archive, and reading sites such as oliphantfiction dot com. The best PDF reader when using it as a tablet is probably SumatraPDF. Touch or make a slight swipe to the right to page forward; make a slight swipe to the left to page backward; touch with two fingers to swap it in or out of reading mode. Also if you enlarge the page with a finger/thumb gesture, the larger page size will be retained when you page forward, which some PDF readers don't do. (You can still read kindle ebooks using Kindle for PC.)\n\nAdded 5-30-2014:\nThis device supports Widi - meaning you can wirelessly beam a video onto your HDTV. If the HDTV has Widi built in, you don't need anything else. If not, make sure your HDTV has a free HDMI port, then buy something like the Actiontec Screenbeam Pro (see my review). See note 6-30-2014 below - Widi not working on second one.\n\nAlmost forgot to mention a battery life issue: Battery life should be about 11 hours. If the battery seems to be draining quickly, even when not in use, the Bios may need updating. The first part is easy - go to the Asus T100TA downloads and download Bios 304 or later, and the utility Winflash (windows bios flash utility). There is nothing to \"run\" in the traditional way. Updating the Bios takes many precise steps. If you phone Asus for support they will walk you through it. (There are several steps where you need to hold down a key for minutes at a time - don't release until told to.) If you are totally non-technical, you can mail in the T100TA to be upgraded. (This may have been bad luck - I just bought a second one, and the battery life is great.)\n\nAdded 6-30-2014:\nI bought a second one (for another family member) but cannot get Widi working on it. (Not to be confused with wifi, which works fine!) Note, it does have a micro-HDMI connection, so it will still connect to your HDMI TV, as long as you have a free HDMI port and the necessary HDMI-to-micro-HDMI cable."}

I did get into a \"loop\" of rebooting situation after 3 days of using but it was not a hardware problem it was something to do with the ASUS live-update and that resolved when I updated the BIOS and drivers manually instead of using the live-update. overall, this would be perfect for you if you are more familiar with or prefer the windows system over other OS and want the touchscreen at a relatively low price."}

I roll around with this thing as a little laptop so it weighs 2.4 pounds because it fits in my back pack easy and it protects the computer, but I get it off its base in seconds and now you got a great tablet. It works great with a stylus pen, I have big fingers and this made the thing even easier to use. The key board is easy to type on and the track pad is average, but having the touch screen makes the touch pad a non factor. It is not the fastest laptop, but is faster then most arm based tablets. The battery lasts forever really 8 hours video watching is possible. I bought this to be a little road warrior that could handle the hard life of a skateboarder and person who rides a bike a lot as transportation. The long battery life and the light weight strong build makes this perfect for just about anyone looking to travel.

One key for me was that it operates as a Laptop and a Tablet. It uses Windows 8.1 so my wife can seemlessly work from her laptop or the T100 and all the software acts the same with no hiccups. Add in the free Asus MySyncFolder cloud service and it doesn't matter what she uses to conduct her business. Remove the keyboard and now she has her tablet to lay comfortably on the couch reading her books from her Kindle account. In Tablet mode it looks, feels and acts like the Surface, honestly I don't know if that's a good thing. But remember I was originally looking at buying the surface. Sure the Microsoft app store is still growing but I have yet to search for an app my wife uses on her android phone that wasn't there. WiFi works great.

I use the T100 to use OneNote, Word, PowerPoint, Evernote  and a program called Logos.  That last program is a powerful Bible study program that is fairly taxing on the hard drive and ram (10 gig download with a retirement of two gigs of ram minimum) .  I also use it to watch Netflix and streaming Spotify to a Bluetooth speaker.  I can say it handles all these quite well. When I read the reviews of this little computer I noticed a recurring theme of problems with automatic updates when setting it up.  I followed the suggestions that I will repeat here for your convenience: 1) do not even think of powering this up for the first time without letting it charge a full eight hours, the charging light will change colors when it is ready 2) once it is fully charged go and shut off the auto Window updates 3) next shut off sleep for the screen and hard drive you can find these in power options 4) with the computer plugged in upgrade the Asus bios through the Asus updater that is on the tablet to the most recent update 5) update the computer through the Windows Updater one update at a time. This should get you where you need to be.  I would suggest that you purchase a 64 gig micro sd card and format it in the FAT32 format for extra storage.  On top of this I would suggest downloading AVG's free virus software (Google it).  I use this with a USB powered screen as an extra monitor with no problems once the proper drivers were downloaded.  This is probably the best value in tech I have ever purchased.  If you follow these guidelines I feel you will also like it.  P.S.  Make sure when you reconnect the screen to the keyboard it snaps in securely and makes a little recognition sound, otherwise it will seem attached and not be."}

ASUS support is a joke.  By 8 weeks, it totally \"forgot\" the keyboard was attached.  And since I never took it apart, its hard to fathom why it was having this issue.  ASUS first told me to go to some site and download a new BIOS tho they warned me that once I did that, I would never be able to get back to the original BIOS.  My last contact with them, when I pretty much told them the unit was junk and that I wanted my money back, they said they don't take merchandise back and that I would have to go to yet another site to download a shipping label then send the thing in for service.  Yeah right.  If all you want is a tablet, its great.  If you actually, gasp, wanted to use the keyboard, forget it.  HUGE ripoff.  And even for a tablet, you can get others just as good or better for less than this piece of junk cost.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "Nobody can doubt, a 10.1\" tablet with Windows 8.1 (not RT), and an included keyboard dock for $350?!?  The only reason I took caution with the purchase is because I couldn't believe the deal I was getting.\n\nFirst of all, there are a few CONS:\n - Build quality really isn't there.  Now, I saw this in person at Best Buy, so I knew what to expect.  It's light and plasticky, but I didn't expect anything different from anything in this price range.\n - The trackpad is small and takes some getting used to.\n - DON'T EXPECT to expand your 64 GB storage with a high-speed SDXC card.\nEven when I plugged in a 90MBps read/80MBps write card (Samsung PRO card), the storage wouldn't exceed 24MBps read/write.  Just under 200Mbps.  That's a LOT slower than USB2.0, which realistically should top out at about 380Mbps or 47.5MBps. I don't know what kind of bus is powering this card slot, but it's NOT USB 2.\n - It doesn't have a terribly speedy SSD (150MBps read/50MBps write), but it's comparable to most low-end laptops, and more than adequate for most things.\n - RAM is not upgradeable.  That being said, the 2GB of RAM works well with most everything you'd do on it.  I put it thru a stress test, and Photoshop would crash if you tried doing anything fancy at all.  But multitasking on nearly anything else shouldn't be a problem.  Windows 8.1 was pretty well designed to be efficient with memory requirements.\n - BEWARE SCRATCHING THE BACK!  I would highly recommend a skin to protect the back of the tablet.  Skinomi has a great carbon-fiber skin that looks like it could be OEM on the Asus!  And they give you a free screen protector!  Don't bother protecting the base of the keyboard, it's got sturdy rubber feet.\n\nThat being said, this little tablet has a lot going for it:\n\n - Cold startup time is incredibly fast!\n - Don't let the Intel Atom specs fool you, this overclocking little 1.33GHz processor ratchets up the speed when you want it too.  Enough to play games like Bioshock, Starcraft 2, and Civilization 5, albeit at low settings.\n - Speakers are nice and clear.  Not terribly loud, but I've never had a setting in which the \"adequate\" volume wasn't enough.\n - Keyboard dock is really pretty decent.  It's the smallest thing that I've ever felt comfortable typing on.\n - Gorilla Glass is a comforting thing to have, especially since I dislike the way screen protectors make your screen feel.\n - Onscreen keyboard is responsive and decent for quick typing...as long as you don't mind the keyboard taking up half of the screen (this is more a Windows 8.1 flaw than an ASUS flaw).\n - A host of ports, HDMI, MicroUSB, USB3.0 on the dock, and a headphone jack are wonderful to have.  Nice to know that Asus hasn't tried to use proprietary connectors.\n\nAll in all, I have to say this:\nThis tablet is SURPRISINGLY more than adequate!  Asus did a great job with deciding what was important, as well as what they should forego to keep the price down."}

(tip: if you have a large print out, select print to one page - not multiple pages! - If single page does not show as an option  Click file / options / advanced * Scroll down to \"printing\" and un-check insert long printouts on multiple pages)\n\n*If you use onedrive (formerly skydrive) you can access all of your files during class as well (your papers, assignments, presentations, etc.) using your schools wi-fi. I highly recommend this as I use my laptop to create my papers/assignments and can work on them at anytime without worrying about having access to my work when I go straight to class with my ASUS, from my office.\n\nThree: During class type your notes right into the pages you have printed to, or downloaded into one note.\nYou can access your text and even search to specific sections/words/phrases using ctrl f far faster then thumbing through your text book\n\nFour: the best part - no more lugging heavy (expensive) printed text books and huge binders with tons of paper.\nJust make sure your tablet has a full charge and you are ready to go!\n\nAs a final note - I have saved so much on the purchase of text books, paper, pens, folders and the like that my ASUS paid for itself with the savings. For classes I knew I didn't need to keep my text book, I rented, saving hundreds of dollars without even counting my savings on \"school supplies!\".\n\nIn my opinion this is a must for any college student and has made my graduate career a breeze!"}

I have also owned a couple of asus tablets in the past (android). I can say this windows tablet is well built and the keyboard and hinge are a perfect fit and geniusly constructed. No one does detachables/transformers like asus.\n\nI saw a lot of negative reviews but I bought it anyway. I have to say I have not encountered any of the problems others are describing. All it took is an hour to make sure I installed all the updates before tablet could go to sleep.\n\nMachine is snappy, this is the first time intel has gotten its atom right.\n\nTablet is plastic but you would not know it. Asus has learned from the mistakes of the past. Previous tablets allowed air between touch screen and glass. This one does not. Previous tablets had flimsy physical buttons that broke easily. This one has great sturdy buttons that are smooth and easy to work with.\n\nA lot of people did not like the keyboard for a variety of reasons. I am used to 10 inch keyboards. The only thing you need to know is that the trackpad sleeps so if you have not used it for 10 seconds or longer, the first click is a wake up touch which does nothing except get trackpad ready for use.\n\nThe USB 3 port on the keyboard is a heaven sent. It makes you feel you are missing nothing from a $1000 desktop or ultrabook.\n\nTablet with keyboard are still so light, you would have no problem using machine in your lap - couch potato heaven. Machine runs cool too, so no worries for future generations. Granted I have not played a graphics heavy game to see if it stays cool under more extreme conditions.\n\nOut of the box, 64 GB actually means 32-33 GB instead. This is not an asus specific problem. This is an industry wide problem. It is high time we are given 64 GB when we pay for 64 GB. Surely there is a way to put in enough storage in addition to OS requirements. But still as it stands, paying $350 for 10 inch tablet with keyboard and office is not a bad deal. It used to be for the same amount you got yourself a crappy low end laptop that froze so often and was too heavy and ran too hot and died in 2-3 hours unless you are near a power outlet.\n\nI am surprised with battery life. A lot of people said that it loses 5% per hour while in sleep mode. Not in my experience. I left it unplugged overnight and it only lost 6%.\n\nI am overall pleased with my purchase. Granted I have had it for two days only so far and I will update this review if something comes up. But so far so good."}

Even apps that were from the same distributors as what can be found on the iPad worked very differently in Windows 8.1.  After using both the ASUS and my wife's iPad on several occasions I simply could not be won over to the ASUS.  Battery life was not what was advertised and had several issues with onscreen keyboard.

I can play Civilization 5 on it (Crashes due to lack of RAM, but runs very well prior to that point), I use it for on-site IT work and network mapping, it's very light, and has a surprising amount of power for such a small device. The dock makes the unit a bit fat and is awkward to use sometimes due to the lack of full size keyboard and the maximum 120 degree tilt of the screen. It is definitely very awkard to use in bed with it propped up on my knees due to this limitation.\n\nOne major issue I have with this device is that the wireless will require \"Reparing\" every single time it is woken from sleep. By repairing, I mean it will not be able to talk to the network and needs to either be set into air plane mode then back to normal, or (in Windows) right clicking the wireless icon and hitting Repair. It resets the gateway or something and all is well, until it goes back to sleep and then we do this all over. It's frustrating.\n\nBattery life is great, comes with Office H+S for free, and best of all, runs full Windows 8.1, meaning you can install software on it that is available through any source instead of just the Windows store. For $400, it's pretty good. For any more than $400, the issues with wireless and limitations with the dock would drive me to another product in the growing market for convertible tablets."}

I spend most of my time in a Linux shell.  I wanted something light and portable enough to take with me everywhere to access my other machines/servers and do some lightweight, emergency-type work.  It is not my main machine.  For this, it is absolutely fantastic, although I would upgrade in a second if this ever comes out with a 12-13\" screen and full-size keyboard.  The processor, memory, disk, etc., are adequate for the tasks I expect to perform on it.\n\nHOWEVER, it has major power problems.  The buttons, in general, including the touch/track pad are the cheapest I've ever seen.  Holding the power button to get it to turn on/off is literally a pain.  90% of the time, it will just not power off.  It takes 10 seconds before the tiny charging light blinks, but most of the time it reboots and powers right back up.  Yes, that's right.  I have a product I can't even turn off.  Well, the battery life is great, so I should not worry.  But, I am experiencing totally weird things regarding power.  I have all the latest Windows updates and the latest BIOS 304.  Apparently, this computer has had a LOT of power problems.  My first day was fine, and I was impressed by the battery life, excepted for being frustrated by the problem of not being able to turn it off.  My second day, after being fully charged, I took it to my kid's sports practice, opened it up, and it was off.  I powered it back on, and it showed 0% battery.  It had shut off due to draining the battery.  This is after being in sleep for maybe 1 hour.  Ridiculous.  No matter what I did -- power off, etc., it always came back up at 0%.  When I got home, I plugged it into the USB charger, and checked it a little while later, expecting it to take many hours to charge, and it was fully charged after 1.5 hours which is impossible.\n\nThis thing has power problems.  BIG TIME.  As I type this, it is currently running fine, but I am really leery to keep it.  Any more glitches, and it's going back.  Great little tablet/laptop, but completely failed execution on anything that has to do with the power/battery, and from the forums/reviews/BIOS updates, Asus still doesn't have it fixed."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "The tablet sees my strong wireless signal but failed to connect to my wireless network.  I spent 6 hours researching, updating the Broadcom wireless drivers, change various settings and resetting the tablet to factory settings 3 times so far to try different combinations of drivers and network settings and it still did not connect to my wireless network.\n\nI am a techie, set up my own network and have 1 desktop running Ubuntu/Windows, 2 laptops running Windows 7, 1 laptop running XP, 2 iPads, 1 Galaxy Tab tablet, 1 Galaxy s3 and 1 s4 phone, 1 Airave VoIP, all on the same network peacefully and everything works, but not the T100.\n\nThe folks on the Transformer Forum were exceptional in their effort to research and help each other to solve similar problems with wifi connection (or the lack of it and its stability).  When you see 175 posts just on this forum alone on this topic since February 2014, you know that this is a persistent problem.\n\nThe ASUS Support web site provided the updates for BIOS and various drivers for the same issues.  However, there are no release notes as noted by members of the Transformer Forum so it's hard to tell which problems are being solved by which driver.  ASUS has a automatic update facility but it only works if you are connected to the Internet and since the T100 does not have an Ethernet port and wireless connection does not work, you are out of luck.\n\nI tried to contact ASUS online chat but they are not available due to the weekend schedule.  Will give it one more try by calling ASUS Monday night but if the call does not resolve the wifi connection issue, I have no choice but returning it to Amazon.  I would definitely appreciate a call from ASUS Support who could help me to resolve the wireless connection problem.\n\n*** June 4th Update ***\n\nASUS Tech did not call me back so I decided to completely wipe the machine and reload everything from scratch, twice, and it now works like a charm.  I suspect that Windows 8 and the ASUS T100 together is potentially still a hit-or-miss kind of installation given the feedback of others.\n\nThe laptop has been working very well since I reloaded Windows 8 from scratch.  Below are a few observations and tips:\n\n1.  Make sure that the screen docks into the keyboard in one smooth and firm motion (holding top of the screen with one hand and the dock hinge with the other hand and push them against each other), otherwise not all of the contacts are made and you need to enter the password using the screen instead of the keyboard.\n\n2.  Some users already mentioned this, the keyboard is not the most stable and is prone to sliding around on hard surfaces (desk, table, airplane tray) since it rests on 2 very tiny raised plastic ridges (part of the docking hinge).  I am planning to get 2 small rubber bump-stops and stick them next the plastic ridges to stop the machine from sliding around.  ASUS could improve this simple design next time by doing the same.\n\n3.  The screen does not open wide enough as a typical laptop would.  This is a compromise to prevent the screen, being heavier than the keyboard, to tip the whole thing over.  You could raise the table or lower your chair for better viewing angle or simply visit a local computer store to see if you could live with it.\n\n4. The machine is fast even with Windows 8, file save and retrieval is pleasantly fast (I ordered a 64 GB micro SD card to save files).  I would also recommend ordering a 16 GB USB drive (the partition will not back itself onto a 16 GB micro SD card) to back up the Windows 8 restore partition for safe keeping.  Once backed up, you can remove the partition to free up space on the 64 GB main memory.\n\n5.  For those of us who don't have (or don't want to buy) an external DVD drive to install software which come on CD-ROM, you could set up the T100 to be part of your home network (which has another computer with the CD-ROM drive available) and access the drive from your T100 to install your software.  I installed Quicken this way and it saved me money and a trip to the store to buy an external drive.\n\n6.  Given the installation glitches I had, I have not updated the BIOS until I am done with what I need to do right now.  Hopefully the update will lengthen battery life.\n\nI am \"upgrading\" my feedback to 4 stars.  Best balance of portability and functionality, reasonable price point and hopefully durability."}

I do!\n\nI am so pleased with this purchase, that I not only want give you my feedback on it, but provide a series of insights that will help you to get the most of your T-100.\n\nWHAT IS IT AND IS IT FOR YOU?\n\nThe Asus T-100 is more of a tablet with attachable keyboard, than a laptop with a detachable screen. I think those who have this perspective are mostly likely to be happy with their purchase. However, in terms of functionality, it combines the power and versatility of both a laptop and a tablet. It is one of the very new generation of tablets that take advantage of Intel's new Quad-core Bay Trail Atom processor. You get the full blown Window 8.1 experience instead of the underpowered and lightweight Windows RT, plus a keyboard that is well-integrated with the tablet.\n\nJust how powerful is the Bay Trail inside the T-100? It's been benchmarked at 6,279 MIPS, which is not far under the i5 processor. Yet, it runs cool (no vent or fan needed) and runs long, up to 11-hour battery life.\n\nAlso, in spectacular fashion, it fulfills a promise that was made in 2012, when Intel promised that Ultrabooks would provide us with lighter, faster, cooler-running notebooks with longer battery life. Looking back with 20/20 hindsight, they failed. I know because I have two a highly-related Samsung and HP Ultrabooks. Both are are better from traditional notebook computer. But they still cough, sputter, and boil their way through the day only offering minor improvements over conventional laptops. Yes, I've written positive reviews of the Ultrabooks I own. But in the big picture, the more I've used them, the more they seem to be better than average notebooks, but not game-changers.\n\nChromebooks and iPads, which I also own, are useful and fun. But the bulk of the serious business still gets done on my Windows-based computers.\n\nNow, into Day 11 of ownership, I'm feeling that the T-100 finally delivers on what Ultrabooks were supposed to have delivered two years ago, when Intel first promised, but failed to deliver lighter, faster, cooler-running notebooks with longer battery life.\n\nThe T-100 is an easy to carry-around portable with the power to get serious work done without worrying with enough juice for a day at Starbucks or flying from L.A. to NY.\n\nHERE'S WHAT I LIKE about the version with 64 gb (no 500 gb hard drive) which I believe is the best version to get:\n\n You get full blown Windows 8.1. So now you can run most if not all the desktop programs you've been running on your Window 7 and XP computers. Thus far, every app I'm tried works fine on the T-100.\n\n Fast. I have two laptops running an i5. My T-100 seems to perform as well as my two i5 ultrabooks. Further boosting performance is the 64gb of blisteringly fast Solid State storage. I strongly recommend getting the 64gb version instead instead of the one that includes the 500gb hard drive, which will dramatically slow down your performance.\n\n Boots up fast as fast as my iPad Air. It goes from \"off\" to login screen in about 7 seconds. After I enter my long password, I'm at the Metro screen instantly with no lag. Once there, it's really operating at optimum speed, until conventional computers whose hard drives are stuttering booting up background processes 5 minutes after you pressed the \"on\" button.\n\n Small and lightweight with no fan or vents. The tablet with the keyboard attached feels no heavier than my Chromebook. Best of all the new architecture of Intel's low-power, but fast Bay Trail microprocessor allows the T-100 to run with no noisy fan or van. Now you truly perch a real Windows 8.1 machine on your lap, couch or  bed -- while actually getting real work done.\n\n Windows 8.1. Yes, I was a skeptic, but I after a couple of days of adjustment, I truly see the genius of the Metro interface. It's just like the icons you see on your iPhone or Android, only better. With the flexibility to re-size and change the colors of the tiles, you have much better sense of visual hierarchy.\n\n Touchpad works fine.\n\n With table attached to keyboard, it opens and shuts just like a laptop. Some people have commented the angle of movement of the screen is not big enough. I think it's fine.\n\n Media Player is far better than native Video app on iPad Air. 8.1's media player allows you precisely move to specific time in a time in a long video your watching. This is not possible in the Video in the iPad Air.\n\n Comes with Windows Office.\n\nTHINGS I DON'T LIKE\n\n It takes too long to charge. But have a possible solution that works for me (later in this review).\n\n No hard disk means there is no indicator that tells you the T-100 is processing something. So there are times when you're wondering if it's frozen or \"thinking.\" This doesn't happen often, but it is slightly disconcerting.\n\n Asus Cloud Storage Nag pop-up. I'll explain to you how I silenced it in my Tips section below.\n\n Cheap plastic netbook look. The Asus T-100 is substance over style for sure.  But I also have solution for that.\n\n Not all that many great apps in the Microsoft App Store. While I got the T-100 in order to run my business-related applications, it would be nice to install some of the great apps that I have on iPad and Android phone. But there's really a great lack in this area that I hope Microsoft eventually overcomes.\n\nTIPS TO HELP YOU GET THE MOST OUT OF YOUR ASUS T-100\n\n1) How I addressed the slow-charge problem. First, let me give you the following disclaimer: I am not recommending the following as a solution for anyone to blindly follow in order to shorten the ridiculous amount of time it takes to fully recharge the ASUS T-100. I have no idea whether it can impact the longevity of the product. Proceed at your own risk. Given that, the ASUS T-100 comes with 2.0 AMP charger. I looked for a \"fast charger\" and found one from a reputable company that makes a 2.4 AMP charger. Now, rather than having to leave it plugged in overnight, my T-100 is fully recharged in 2 or 4 hours.\n\n2) Add a 64gb (or 128gb) Class 10 UHS 1 Micro SD. This is the one I got:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Sony-64GB-microSDXC-Class-10-UHS-1-Memory-Card/dp/B00E1XI94Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Sony 64GB microSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card</a>&nbsp;and you'll double your storage. Move your big data files (such as movies) and you'll have a decent amount left for your apps.\n\n3) Don't fight Windows 8.1. Surrender to it and you'll develop a full appreciation of Metro by using the touchscreen. I think you'll come to like it more than the Windows 7 interface as long as you recognize that is for today's users who are getting more and more accustomed to tapping icons on their phones. I really prefer this over Windows 7 now. It far more more efficient than the old START button.\n\n4) Get rid of the Asus Cloud Storage Nag. I did this by signing up. But because I didn't want to get dinged a year from now for having to pay for a Terabyte storage a year from now, I'm identified the icon in the System Tray and disabled it by right clicking and closing it.\n\n5) Get a case for both the Tablet (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/VSTN-Asus-Transformer-Book-T100-ultra-thin-Smart-Cover-Case-For-Asus-Transformer-Book-T100-Black-II/dp/B00HFT5252/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">VSTN Asus Transformer Book T100 ultra-thin Smart Cover Case (For Asus Transformer Book T100, Black II)</a>) along and the for the keyboard and the table attached together (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/IVSO-ASUS-Transformer-Pad-Infinity-T100-10-1-inch-Leather-Keyboard-Portfolio-Stand-Cover-Case-Black/dp/B00GSMJDUC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">IVSO ASUS Transformer Pad Infinity T100 10.1-inch Leather Keyboard Portfolio Stand Cover Case (Black)</a>). These thick cases that go directly against the grain of the \"thin, light and beautiful\" trend that has been in place since the first iPhones came out. But I really think they increase the visual appeal of the T-100.\n\nOverall, the ASUS T-100 has surprised me in a good way. I initially thought it would be under-powered and was dreading Windows 8.1 I was, thankfully, wrong on both accounts.\n\nI thought I was getting something more like the netbooks of two years ago. Instead, I see this as being a revolutionary product which provides versatility and power on the go for Windows users and quite possibly give Apple a run for their money.\n\nUPDATE 5/29/2014 FIXING A BOTTLENECK\n\nWow...in just the few weeks since I purchased the T-100, there have been a boatload buyers with reviews across the spectrum between love and hate.\n\nFor anyone interested, I discovered an Achilles Heel that this laptop has which is very solvable. In spite of the it's Bay Trail microprocessor and Solid State Drive, I still experienced frustrating periods during which the T-100 seems to hang. But what I discover is that the hanging is not due to processing. Rather, it's due to the weak Wifi radio that's built into it.\n\nHow do I know that? Simple, I found the T-100 running slow. I happened to walk closer to Wifi transmitter and instantly, it was racing like a Ferrari. With this evidence, in mind, I did some research and wound up buying the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Medialink-Wireless-N-USB-Adapter-300-Mbps-802-11n-2-4-ghz-Compatible-with-Windows-8-Windows-7-Windows-Vista-Windows-XP/dp/B00A3VFIM6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Medialink Wireless-N USB Adapter (300 Mbps) - 802.11n, 2.4 ghz - Compatible with Windows 8 / Windows 7 / Windows Vista / Windows XP</a>.\n\nIt was easy to set up. After activating, I found that it made a huge difference removed the bottlenecks that would occur on any process that was Internet related."}

On performance, the 3 Win8 tablet are on par, and all are good as they have Office bundled.  I tried the T100 as I was attracted by the keyboard.  However, it turns out to be too small for serious typing.  As such, I will use a full size keyboard when at home and hook it up to my 24 inches monitor.  While I am on the go, I will not bring it with me as well, so I will say the keyboard is right now quite useless to me.  What's more, it makes my purchase a stupid decision as it is the keyboard that prompted me to buy.  Its weight also makes me reluctant to have it on the go.  Right now, I am using the Toshiba for most of the time.  Have it on the go and hook it up to a wireless keyboard and monitor when at home.\n\nI will recommend this product to those who REALLY need the keyboard and have small hands.\n\nFor those who need light weight Win8 tablet, go for the Miix2.\n\nFor people like me, who need a portable tablet for occasional Office work, while wanted to avoid hassle of syncing the data when at home, I will strongly recommend the Toshiba Encore, or probably the Acer one (I have not tried it though )."}

Maybe it's just my IP, but all other devices in the house work well on the network. Maybe it's the version of Windows 8 that came pre-installed, because non-browsing actions also have a hitch in its giddy-up. Also, clicking the tablet into the keyboard is a bit cumbersome.

Absolutely fantastic service and response by Amazon (they get 10 stars).\n\nI needed a new tablet and a new mobile PC, so I went with this hybrid - the Asus T100.  I had been indecisive in my choice for a while now, as I was considering the Asus T300 (which has a 13\" screen).  I love the real estate of big screens.  When the price for the T100 dropped to $350, I scooped one up.  With Office 2013 and Win 8.1 installed (e.g., earlier versions had 8.0 and required user upgrading), I could not pass up this absolutely terrific deal.  I am also now glad I went with the much lighter T100 (less than 2 pounds with keyboard), as the 13\" screen would be too heavy for how I use this device (but maybe not for others).\n\nUnlike many here, I had NO problems setting up the device.  I readily admit that this may be due my later purchase (April 2014) than others posting comments here.  Necessary BIOS upgrades (version 227) and Win 8.1 were already installed on the device.  However, I did need to install quite a few Windows updates over the course of a couple of hours.  The first thing I did was charge the device, as clearly instructed by Asus.  I cannot emphasize enough how important this was to my successful experience with the T100.  It is easy to see why others have had problems with their T100, when not fully charging the device first (which took about 5 hours for me).  I would also strongly recommend reading the review by \"Curry\" (it was very helpful to me).\n\nThe only negative I have experienced is not with the device itself, , but with the selection of app's available through the Windows Store ... it leaves quite a bit to be desired (much disappointment).  This is my only complaint with Windows 8.1.  However, I would distinguish that the Asus T100 hardware is terrific (so far).  Besides being pretty powerful (especially for a 10\" tablet), the screen is very pretty and clean."}

This is perfect for that. Very light with a good battery life (10 hrs). The best thing is it runs full windows so I can use any applications I need. And it handles most common workloads pretty well - such as running Office, Lync, Office documents and webpages in parallel. The keyboard is a little small but you get used to it pretty quick. This is the only device i take on the road and it hasn't let me down. I use onedrive to sync documents across multiple machines so I always have my up to date fileswindow ready on this device."}

I could go on and on saying the same thing with different words, but I will leave you with some tips to make sure your experience is as great as mine.\n\n1. Do your research.  There are \"best practice\" ways to set this up that will make everything easier. (this is so critical)\n2. Fully Charge the product before beginning the updates or using it.\n3. Get a microSD card.  64gb Class 10 microSD card is well worth the money.  Also, get the 64gb SSD version of tablet.\n4. Again, do plenty of research, and do all of the research before you get this product in your hands.\n\nI hope that I haven't scared anyone away from buying this product, because you have to tweak it to get it functioning at a high level.  This product could easily sell for double, based on what you get.  A full version of Windows 8.1, 10-12 solid hours of battery life ( easily use for a full day), Microsoft Office, Keyboard with USB 3.0, expandable microSD slot, 720p screen.\n\nThis could be the best purchase I have ever made.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "This is basically just a tablet with a real-ish keyboard, so if that's what you want, the Asus is perfect. Even for such use, there are a couple of big critques:\n1) Power: first the plug is incredibly short, making it very difficult to use while charging, and also, while you're using it, it not only doesn't increase in charge, but also decreases (although slightly slower). This means that if you're totally out of juice, it's a brick until you let it charge for several hours--yeah, it also charges incredibly slowly. While the battery life is long, it makes consistent use pretty difficult\n\n2) Updates: They take forever, and if you walk away to let them finish, the computer turns off, ending the update. This is pretty inconvenient and annoying.\n\n3) Docking: You have to dock it perfectly correctly, or the keyboard won't engage, and there is no way to tell if it's docked other than whether or not the keyboard works.\n\nOtherwise, it's a fine travel laptop, not great for heavy business or school use, but works for those surfing the internet with some need to do word processing or real e-mail."}

As a tablet OS Windows 8 is great. I've only had  it a few days but the battery life seems OK.\nCons: Not a very rugged plastic frame that is glass smooth, makes you a slightly nervous about handling it (dropping it), but that goes away when it is plugged into the keyboard. Windows 8 is not very backwardly compatible & kinda sucks for desktop apps, I may have to switch to W7 if I want to use some of my expensive older software (would cost a lot more to upgrade software then to downgrade windows). I don't think the touchscreen has an oleophobic coating, it gets a lot of fingerprints on it, but you only really notice that when it is off."}

I charged the unit for 11 hours, though it didn't reach 100%. The next day I started it anyway, the power was about 95%. I selected not to automatically perform Windows update during initial setup. Tested every apps displayed, installed a couple of new apps from the Store, tested. Tested Mail, Desktop, internet connection. Installed iTunes and Chrome, tested. Activated MS Office and tested all modules. Then manually selected updates to perform. While doing this, the battery was being drained even when connected and charging. I had to power it off once in a while (Charging was so slow!) and come back. The power didn't reach 100% either the second day. I let it charged overnight the second night. The third day the power reached 100%. After a few days charging seems getting 'normal'. I was able to create a recovery copy on a 8 GB USB drive. I registered the unit today. I am keeping this one.

I've had this unit for going on a month now and I'm still learning to get along with Windows 8.1.  Finding how to do things is not very intuitive for a geezer used to Vista but I'm adjusting.  I don;t find the smaller keyboard to be much of an issue.  I use this unit for surfing, email, personal financials and other misc stuff.  Although the hard drive size is small by today's standards and would probably be sufficient for me for sometime to come  I'm using a USB thumb drive and Micro SD for data storage.  It got a virus shortly after I received the unit but a good spyware program took care of that.  It works reasonably well as a keyboard computer and as a tablet.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "Let preface this by stating I am OCD when it comes to my electronics. I notice EVERYTHING.\n\nSo let's start with ...\n\nTHE BAD:\n\nIt's no surprise that at this price-point, there would be some minor defects. I ended up returning one (maybe two ... not gonna lie) before I was satisfied. The first one had a \"pimple\" formed in the plastic casing of the tablet, which is fine ... it's cosmetic. But then I attached the dock and the trackpad was doing all sorts of crazy things that I could not fix, regardless of the settings, so I sent it back. I was not sure about a windows tablet anyway ... I am really an Apple person. A few weeks later, Amazon offered it $30 cheaper! This enticed me to try it again. It arrived with no blemish on the casing and no trackpad issues. HOWEVER, there is a noticeable light bleed that appears near the right bracket where the docking station connects. I believe this to be a design flaw, but it's not really that annoying, unless it's going to distract you while watching a movie in the dark with the black bars on top and bottom. I confirmed this by viewing another unit, which exhibited the exact same screen irregularity. Other negatives include:\n- I'm having difficulty getting the micro SD card reader to read my class 10 card and it seems this is a shared experience. It only likes certain card manufacturers so do your research.\n- It's a fingerprint MAGNET, so keep a microfiber cloth handy\n- Get a case, because the polished plastic casing on this scratches like no one's business\n- As reviews have stated, the screen is not the best (obviously, from what I said about the light bleed that comes standard with each), but I feel that it does the job JUST FINE. It's clear and pleasant to view. Could the contrast be better? Yes. Could it be brighter for better viewing in bright areas and less glare? Yes. Are you going to absolutely hate it? No ... it's no retina display, but it's much sharper than the display on the first iPad Mini or 1st gen iPad. You are not going to find a 10 inch tablet at this price-point. Would you rather a great processor with a good screen? Or a second-rate processor with a super 1080P screen at a higher price-point? Pick your battles, bargain shoppers.\n\nTHE GOOD:\n\n- This. Thing. Is. FAST! So smooth switching through menus and such a pleasure to navigate.\n- FULL WINDOWS 8.1!!! I love the versatility of being able to use the new interface, while also being able to go back to the windows we are all familiar with.\n- Microsoft Office!!! You get the full office programs that you need for school: MS Word, MS Excel, and MS PowerPoint. What a great value for someone getting this for their student or just the average user. And recently, I started using OneNote and it is a TOTAL JOY with this tablet. I hold it like a clipboard and write my notes during management meetings. Everyone asks me what I'm using. It's so effortless. I love it. It transfers through the cloud to my office computer so I can share the meeting notes with my staff. The tablet is excellent for this purpose.\n- Accurate touch response on what I understand is Gorilla Glass (so it's scratch resistant as well)\n- Dock - I don't know know why some reviewers state the dock is cheap and uncomfortable to use. I find that it feels solid, responsive, and easy to type (and I'm actually a typist). My hands are also above average size.\n- The screen is still considered HD - it's not 1080P, but it is 720P and even with the slightly annoying light bleed, none of the three units I \"tested\" (we'll go with that) had a single dead or stuck pixel. That's saying A LOT. I have seen MUCH MORE expensive tablets plagued with dead pixel issues and/or dust trapped under the screen. Props to ASUS for that!\n\nWhy buy this?\n\nYou're a student on a budget (perfect) -OR- you're a guy like me who wanted a cheaper 10\" tablet that was great for FULL ON, unrestricted web browsing (remember that Android and Apple don't do flash). That was my intention initially, but what I GOT was more than I anticipated. I use it for taking notes during meetings at work, for some light gaming, and I use the BING apps constantly to read news, etc. (check out the health app with the 3d human body - it's awesome).\n\nDespite some minor improvements that could be made, you cannot go wrong with this as an entry-level Windows tablet. It's a much more cost-effective alternative to the $500+ tablets out there that can't do half what this does."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I bought this back in November and specifically waited to write this review.\n\nPros: Perfect Size, Touch screen works well, MS Office included (Full Version, Full License), Accessories are now more available (many more choices), Battery Life is FANTASTIC, Windows 8.1 (actually I like it now!), Fully Functional PC!\n\nCons: Windows 8.1 (There was a learning Curve), Screen and Case are fingerprint magnets, top heavy when using keyboard (that's how I know it is durable). Small Memory Capability (easily remedied with External Hard Drive though).\n\nI was looking for a tablet to replace my ageing netbook that I used for traveling.  I used the netbook for movies, checking email, etc.  Nothing heavy.  I tried several time to use it for presentations of one sort or another but was limited by not having Office on it.  Since the company gave me a full size laptop (desktop replacement) I made do.\n\nThis piece of kit is a BEAST in my book.  I travel only with this unit now.  I have a fully functioning laptop with this tablet.  Admittedly, this is not to replace the large screen laptops or 24\" monitors that you see on most desks.  However, as an end user on most software, I love this little guy.\n\nI travel at least once a month where I am on a plane for at least 6 hours with a layover and then another 3 hour flight.  I use this for watching movies, reviewing emails, video conferencing with family, etc.  I don't plug this unit in until I arrive at the hotel.  I do some common sense kind of battery management (turn the screen brightness down a bit, it can be very bright!) but that is about it.\n\nThe biggest con I had originally was the very small memory capacity.  I went with the 64GB version and I have 64GB micto SD card inserted that stays in.  When I watch movies though, I had been using an external HD (USB 3.0) and letting the battery power it all while watching the movie from the EHD.  I can't kill the battery even after a hard day of use.\n\nPlug it in at night, voil it is ready to go the next morning.  It does take longer to charge than most other devices, however if you want the battery life, you have to compromise somewhere.  No fuel cell technology at this level yet.  Be sure and use the supplied AC charger and a high quality micro USB cable.  I say high quality only because there is a noticeable difference in charging time when I use a cheap aftermarket Micro USB cable and either the OEM one or one that was an OEM cable from another device.\n\nI use this out in my workshop to stream music when I am working on a project and I do not use external speakers.  The sound is good and it is loud.  It doesn't have the base that a system with a sub-woofer would have but it puts out some great mid-ranges and surprisingly good lows for the size the speakers are.\n\nThe apps that are available are catching up for Windows.  The major App providers have been doing so (Facebook, Netflix, Hulu, etc.)  The beauty of it all though is that this is a full function Windows PC.  So you use their Internet based apps over your choice of browser and it all works beautifully.  I deleted several apps for exactly that reason, and gained valuable memory real estate.\n\nThe reason it works so well is the processor.  Simply put, I can find no bottle neck other than the bandwidth of the particular public place I may be in while using this.  When I am at home with some awesome speeds, there is never a stutter or buffering issue.\n\nNow, take all of this as coming from a guy who does not own a single Apple product.  I am not in their ecosystem of iTunes or anything.  I am a middle aged husband and Dad of a teenager, who is somewhat geeky, enjoys a moderate amount of media content, but I don't even have a data plan on my second hand Android phone because I use WiFi wherever I go (That saves me $50 a month!)  Style is a factor that is far, far, far, far down the list from functionality and ease of use as well as portability.  If I am ever stylish it is an accident.  Khakis and Golf Shirts are my \"Business Casual.\"  I prefer jeans and a comfy buttondown (untucked), oh and Birkenstocks...with socks.  Yes I am that guy (only around the house though, the wife won't let me out of the house dressed like that).\n\nI digress...\n\nTo sum it all up, if you want the sleekest, most popular, most supported with novelty apps, loved by hipsters and emo's alike, this is probably not the device for you.\n\nIf you are a person who cares more about substance, function, ease of use, customization-ability, portability, durability, or you are a person who drives a mini-van without shame, this may work well for you!"}

Humidity or dryness on your fingers seems to affect glide pad responsiveness / sensitivity more than other pads I've used.  It could be better, but I don't find it quite as bad / annoying as other reviewers have mentioned.

After days of reading countless reviews and making my decision on what I wanted from a tablet/laptop, I pulled the trigger on the ASUS and it arrived in two days (love Amazon Prime)!\n\nAs stated in the instructions and in reviews, I plugged in my new toy and let it charge for 8+ hours before turning it on.  Check.\n\nAfter (somewhat) patiently waiting, it was time to turn on my lil bundle of new tech happiness...or so I thought.  I turned on the system and quickly made my way through the initial setup.  At first, I thought this was necessary to use the keyboard as it did not yet work.  Well, turns out this is not the case.  The problem is the tablet portion would not stay seated in the keyboard dock.  I had to reseat it about 10 times for it to actually work...for about ten seconds...and then that nice little sound would go off; the one indicating connection between the keyboard and tablet was lost (this sound would later haunt me in my dreams that night).  So I re-seated it, again...and again...and again.....aaaand again.  At first this was really frustrating and certain colorful adjectives were thrown, but then it became a game to see who could adjust the tablet portion the least before causing the disconnect.\n\nNext issue, I did not notice it initially on a light background, but as I switched back and forth between light and dark backgrounds, I noticed what looked like a star saying hello...but alas, it was not a star, rather a dead pixel.  At first I thought I could over look this, but much like a squirrel to a dog, it constantly caught my attention and I could not avoid looking at it (think about the principal in movie Uncle Buck and you'll know what I mean).\n\nFinally, the system seemed to run a bit on the slower side after two or three applications were opened.  I realize it only has 2 Gb of memory, but the app running were not that intensive and should not have caused that much stress to to the system.\n\nOK, one more thing (and this is no fault of the tablet, but worth mentioning).  If you are in the market for a tablet or PC that plays well with the \"cool kid apps\", you may want to reconsider using a Windows based tablet/PC.  Microsoft attempts to make carbon copies of a lot of today's popular apps, but fails miserably in execution.\n\nI hope this helps and I wish you well in your search for tablet/laptop utopia.  However, based on my experience, it is not found in this product...or my house.

Still hate that it won't open far enough when attached to keyboard, but generally liked it OK. Now, though, I have just been zapped by the charger. No signs of damage, but it just shocked me and left a painful, visible burn. Always hated the short cord, but have tried lots of other good chargers and premium dedicated charging cords, and all take even longer than the asus pair to charge. Not sure how to go about getting replacement charger, and pretty frightened that it could have shocked a child or started a fire - but really don't want to deal with returning the whole computer. Original review: Win8 not new to me, wanted more than just a single port, love tablets, and I'm also used to small keyboards, so I was ready to love this. Really can't though, because I hate that the dock hinge will not allow the screen to tilt back! Why?? Pretty much useless in your actual lap. Even on a desk or airplane tray, you gotta slouch down like Steven Van Zandt in Lilyhammer if you want a direct viewing angle. Driving me so crazy I'm really hoping somebody somehow modifies it and posts a DIY fix for this foolish limitation on the angle. It seems crazy to buy this then be considering a bluetooth keyboard case for laptop typing. Definitely need to find a better case or skin than the very slippery iPearl hard shell I got, as all that sliding around combined with the inability to tilt the screen back much past 90 degrees is annoying enough that it isn't replacing the devices I hoped it would (kindle fire hd that's easy to hold, and especially my win7 netbook that opens up almost flat for easy typing and viewing in your lap. Otherwise, it's a decent little machine that held up to intense work and play on it's first trip.

I guess i'll start by saying that the keyboard and mouse are better than I expected and don't feel cheap and neither does the tablet, overall the devices feels very sturdy and beefy, I was expecting it to be light as a feather, have no weight and feel cheap, couldn't have been further from the truth, this thing feels quality and to me that means alot.\n\nThe tablet snaps in the base really clean with a little pressure, which makes it more deep and secure. The tablet does not outweigh the keyboard it sits level and doesn't tip backwards like I thought it may, it's solid.\n\nWindows 8.1 itself is dreamy great and smooth install, just a few settings and it's running, no bloatware only 3 programs running after full install including features such as cloud storage. 37 GB storage left after full install. Games and applications can be installed to an additional MicroSD if you decide to buy one, I installed Steam to the MicroSD and a few games and they run fast and fluid off the MicroSD.\n\nI've only run a few games on the device so far, but what I have ran has run well such as Minecraft, Terraria and Guild Wars are all very playable and in the 20-30 fps zone with maxed graphics and resolution. I may amend this review later to include more game testing but since it runs what I wanted it's all i'm including in this review, needless to say it is adequate and will run some decent games and the games it runs look and are much better than android games obviously.\n\nThe main reason I bought this though was for the included Microsoft Office Home and Student which not only is pre-installed, but comes with the official seal of purchase serial sticker in the package, so you just enter the serial code and keep and you're good to go, very easy. It also comes with an official warranty serial sticker included inside the manual for proof of ownership which is great. Also the screen is bright and the sound is great, both better than expected.\n\nThis thing is worth the money, really nothing more to say. It doesn't feel cheap, it does everything a laptop does and has the convenience of also being a tablet....a Windows 8.1 tablet that is.... that you can detach and walk around the house while you do spreadsheets, watch a movie or continue a game while you do other things, that alone is worth the price of admission."}

Or get the Lenovo Miix2 11 if it ever comes out and gets better reviews than the HP Omni 10 and the Dell Venue 11 pro, both of which sport the much faster Atom Z3770 SOC, and full HD.\n\nThis unit has the Atom Z3740 which as a quad core with 2 MB of cache run circles around my two 11.6\" Windows tablets, one Lenovo Lynx, and an HP Envy X2 that came with the keyboard. My tablets were first gen Clover trail Atom Z2760 SOCs which are only dual core and only 1 MB of cache. It is my annual \"get the new and sell the old\" while it is still worth at least half what was paid. So I am replacing mine.  My wife likes her Lynx for now as I do my Envy X2. But I like to test and report on new tech toys for me now that I'm retired.\n\nRemember, change the power plans using Control Panel/Power Options/Power Plans and change them to no power saving at all and plugged in for update days, then remember to switch back after they are done.\n\nOne tip I think all need from reading the reviews is some of what I do with my tablets. Windows updates when first setup will take a long time. Some folks are talking about issues with the tablet dying in the middle of updates. And the advice to change the updates from auto may hurt some non techies. What I did was set up power plans that did not let the tablets sleep, shut down the drives, or turn the screen off.  It is simple just go to Control panel, then looking at it with large Icons click on Power options. The default is balanced or power saver. Just set up a custom one that does not allow any slowdown when using it for updates or long scans.  Here is a link to how to do that with screen shots.\n[...]\nThen just remember that Microsoft releases their updates on the second Tuesday of each month and next will update on May 13th. Just remember to switch your power plan back to balanced or however you prefer it for battery and plugged in for day to day use, then remember to switch to your never turn off power plan when plugged in just before long scans or updates. I have four custom power plans, you can make one or more if you need it.  But nothing irritates me more than forgetting to switch power plans and coming back to find it went to sleep and all has to be redone."}

I saw the bad reviews about updates causing problems when the t100 is not fully charged, and wanted to be patient.  Amazon delivered a day earlier than expected, so I had that going for me.\n\nDay 2:  After powering on and testing a few things out, I decided to apply updates, using ASUS updater utility.  Shortly afterwards, the computer notified me that it had \"encountered a problem and needed to reset\".  When it restarted, it went into the Aptio BIOS utility and would not leave, despite trying to exit many times.  Finally, it appeared that if I held the power button for 20 seconds or so, it finally did restart.  I applied a factory reset immediately.\nLater in the afternoon, I re-ran the ASUS updates successfully, then ran through the Windows 8.1 updates.  So far so good.  I activated MS Office successfully.\nDuring the course of the day, I noticed that the battery was draining, but wasn't too surprised... updates require downloads and computational power.  However, when left alone on the charger, it didn't seem to be charging.\n\nDay 3:  Charge down to 15 percent, even though on the charger all night.  Start it up and within 5 minutes, it shuts down unexpectedly and goes back to the BIOS utility.  After 30 minutes of frustration, finally I remember to hold the power button down for an inordinate amount of time.  The battery is now even lower, so I plug it in while working on it.  I looked online for info on battery charging and see that people have had problems with the included charger, so I pull out another to try it.  When I unplug the cable, everything goes dead because the battery is fully discharged.  After impatiently waiting 50 minutes, it finally can turn back on.  In the meantime, I had checked the ASUS charger by successfully partially charging my phone.  There don't seem to be any problems with the cord or charger.\n\nWithin 20 minutes, the thing turns off again due to an unexpected error.  Of course, the battery is now too depleted to restart.\n\nI want to like this thing.  It is small. It includes office. I can, in theory, be productive on it (compared to my iPad or Nook).  I've rooted nooks and phones.  When doing that, I expect some bumps in the road.  When buying and using the stock software, I expect it to just work.  So far, this thing is failing, and failing hard.  I can't imagine the average user dealing with this."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I highly recommend this computer. And I'll tell you all the reasons why. (If you're a MAN with big fingers, than MAYBE not for you, some men w/big fingers don't adjust to a small keyboard, that's just anatomy.) I love my Asus! I purchased my Asus in early Dec. of 2013. Now over 4 months later I can honestly say I am beyond impressed with it. (After being so happy with this I bought an Asus MeMOPad HD 7-Inch tablet for my 11 yr. old son's birthday because I knew the Asus product wasn't going to let him or myself down, and he loves his!) Is there a learning curve due to windows 8.1 and a small keyboard? Of course, but they are slight! If you don't have the patience to learn a new system and work with a small keyboard, then stay with a traditional heavy regular laptop. I was researching computers for about 3 months before my purchase and stumbled across this one day. I wasn't looking for a 2-in-1, but this Asus computer was rendered from a search query w/what i was looking for, so I dug deeper. I read reviews and learned from them, like understanding when I bought it to charge it for a solid 10 hours before touching it. (For the battery life you get in return, I would of waited longer!) I was expecting a small keyboard, and read after a week or two of use that you get used to it. And I did. It's SO light weight you can take it anywhere! And it does everything I need it to!  It has a full size USB, and I was even able to download the drivers to use my old HP printer. The computer has wireless printing, but my printer doesn't, so I just plug in and print. Some people complained about sound, but seriously? Would you expect stereo sound from a phone? I bought a small (can carry in my purse) wireless (can be connected w/wire too) Pyramid speaker, I run it through the Bluetooth, and viola, all the sound you need! The BIG selling point for me? Microsoft office home and student 2013 edition free! (Mine was downloadable, but FREE). I am a grown woman who is in her first year of school. I knew I would be in need of a computer and Microsoft office Word for my English class this semester and this computer has allowed me to do everything I need and more. Any issues I have run into have to do with IE, and are issues of IE's integration with windows 8.1. The technology is just ahead of the browsers. There are a few keys on the keyboard which can cause you to jump somewhere unexpectedly, but that's because they are \"window\" keys and such. Once you're used to the lay out, it's not a big deal, and if you're in word and hit something, just use the undo option, no big deal. Some people complained about the plastic glossy top. If it was any kind of metal, the machine would be heavier. I'll take the portability over looks thank you. Some people complained that it looked/felt cheap. Seriously? I have a light weight computer that does everything I need, I couldn't be happier! I'm a mom, a part time college student, and part time server, I'm not in fashion contest. And I still think the machine looks great as is. And yes it's a touch screen, you're gonna get smudges, A quick swipe w/a cleaning cloth takes care of that. Any screen no matter how fancy is going to leave behind oils from your fingers. If you're in the market for a full functional computer, with office, that is lightweight, has amazing battery life, and detaches to be a tablet to boot, than this is a great find! Yes don't forget it's a tablet too! The screen isn't loaded with mega pixels, it's not super Hi-resolution, but it still has a great look! And you can buy a micro HDMI cord and hook it to your TV if you want to! There's just so much you can do with this computer! I wanted a touch screen laptop, and wasn't even sure if I would find one that had what I was looking for on the tight budget I had to deal with, and this little 2-in1 came along and took everything I thought I had learned from my researching and blew it out of the water. Asus isn't offering a sub-par product at a sub-par price. They're offering a quality product that can do what many others can do, for a lot less in many cases. That's the way to make a name for yourself and create a strong, loyal, customer base, something way too companies have lost sight of,or in this day and age have never had. As I said, I already bought a 2nd Asus product for my son, and will definitely by from this brand when another product is needed in the future."}

Larger yes, but superior in every other way.\nCons:\n- I wasn't impressed with the speed - it was actually quite slow even when only running one program.\n- keyboard is really cramped, and I have very small hands, so sorry for you big fellas :) I wouldn't call this a laptop. It competes more with the iPad/Kindle Fire crowd.\n- Will often not come out of hibernation easily, when you press the power button, and that has nothing to do with the battery life. It just doesn't always respond to the power button. Had to fiddle with it for 2-3 minutes several times to get it to come back on.\n- Charges incredibly slowly\n- immediately began having issues with it saying my hard drive was full (notice this doesn't have a large hard drive in general). however, i had not put any files on it, other than a handful of pictures (50 or less) and few apps, like facebook.\n\nNote: when I complained to the seller, I was told to do a factory reset and I confess I just sent it back at that point. B/c really? it's brand new and I already have to do that. I let it run the first setup seamlessly, so there was no issue with me somehow intervening in or interrupting it's normal first time setup process. I think there's fundamental issue in the software.\n\nPros:\n- detachable keyboard designs is good. light weight, without feeling cheap. Screen is bright and colors are good.\n\nSummary: I'm not sure why you would buy this. If you want a real laptop, you can get something much faster, with a touchscreen, with more space for the same price through Dell. Yes it will be larger, but again - you're wanting a laptop, which I presume you want to type on comfortably and want a larger screen for reviewing things. IF you want a tablet, then again, superior products are available for less or about the same price. I have an ipad now through work, and it is also a superior experience to this in terms of the lightweight, keyboard and general tablet experience. I think this device suffers from being in between tablet and laptop, and not being particularly good at either."}

I called tech support, they told me if I did a factory reset they were 99.999999999% sure that it would fix my problem - I did what they instructed and it did NOT fix the problem. I sent it in to be serviced, paid over $200 for a new motherboard and hard drive disk. When I got it back, it was not fixed; it immediately shut off. I sent it back in AGAIN to be \"fixed\" and when I got it back it worked for about one month. Now it is doing the exact thing that they supposedly \"fixed\", which is spontaneously shutting off. So now I have to send it back in AGAIN for the THIRD time, and at this point, I have very little confidence that the problem will be fixed, as it was not fixed the previous two times it was sent in. I have never been so disappointed in a product. I will NEVER BUY AN ASUS AGAIN. For being a new company, you would think they would at least have better tech support/customer service since they are having to compete with Apple, Dell etc. They're product is sub-par and their tech support and computer technicians seem incompetent and uneducated about the product that they are selling. I usually never complain about products, I just won't give them my business anymore, but I paid almost $800 for this piece-of-crap laptop that has been the bain of my existence for the past 6 months. I had a lot of expensive architecture software that I lost and that I can't get back. SO-heed my words, if you want a quality product and you have expensive software that you'd like to keep, DON'T BUY AN ASUS, THEY ARE ABSOLUTE GARBAGE."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I loved this product and was a big fan of ASUS until I had to deal with support.  I paid $450, knowing the average price was less because I needed the Transformer before tax season. 82 days into tax season and on the fifth time that I docked the tablet to the keyboard the screen cracked from the left port and spider up to the right in front of my eyes.  Dealing with ASUS has been a very slow arduous process.  It took me four calls to get an RMA number as ASUS's system was down.  All four agents seem to be reading from a script and stated that I needed to return the product and would not listen to the facts of the case.  They all just stated that there could be a \"potential\" charge and I would have to call back when the system was up.  They would not let me speak with a supervisor and said that I had to return the product before they could elevate the case.  Well, I crossed my fingers and sent the product back on April 3, 2014. I enclosed a letter explaining what happened, provided proof that I purchased a protective case and assured them that the product was not mishandled given there was not one scratch or dent on any surface of the product.  After checking several times with support, I finally got an email on April 17, 2014 stating that there would be a $137 charge to fix and return the product.  Given that I did not drop the tablet, had it in a protective cover and knew that I did not cause the crack, I called back today and asked if I could now speak with a supervisor since I had followed the instruction to first return the product.  Support (Megan) was very pleasant and said not to worry that a case manager could handle the review.  She put me at ease, but when I requested to be transfer to the case manager; Megan said unfortunately she is not available. To complicate matters the email that I received stated that if I did not pay for the repairs by 4/21 (in 4 days) ASUS would return my product without repairs.  Megan stated that it would take 2-4 business days for the case manager to return my call and she would ensure that the product was not returned until a case manager looked at my product, but given that no one else had this problem she was not hopeful. Now I have a very bad feeling that no one will be looking into my case, the computers were never down, and I will have wasted $28 shipping the product back to ASUS.  So now, I am close to $500 out of pocket.  I did a search and found that others had the same issue and several reviews had pointed out the poor construction of the screen.  In retrospect, I should have taken it to a local shop for repairs as it would have been cheaper, but given I was sure that ASUS would honor the warranty given the facts, I wasted the money on the postage that would have paid 50% of the cost to repair it locally.  I am sorry to say that I own all ASUS products and given how my case has been handled, I am now faced with the harsh reality of buying a back up computer as I use them all for business.  If I encountered this problem with all my systems during tax season, I would be out more than just a computer-I would have lost my business.  Very disappointed with ASUS and I will be pressed to recommend them in the future."}

We ignored salesmen in two different computer retailers and ordered from Amazon, due to positive reviews. We kept the product for less than 30 days.

I have it set up on the desk with an Acer HDMI 24\" LED monitor and a Microsoft USB keyboard and mouse. Everything works flawlessly! It will likely stay in the desktop setup about 95% of the time so I have not had much chance to use it as just a tablet so far but what I have experienced I am liking."}

The screen is nice and bright, the keyboard, while small, is still comfortable to use. You also get good sound from the speakers. As a tablet it also works really well. The touchscreen is responsive and the weight is tolerable. The Baytrail processor is no Core i7 but it's quite snappy and has no problem handling everyday tasks. My only gripe is that there are such few apps in the windows store. All in all it does everything I want it to do and besides there's just no beating that price."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I'm not a technie, I just love gadgets. I had been looking for a faster laptop to replace my Vivienne Tam edition netbook. I decided on this because it does everything that I need it to. It is compact, it's faster than my old netbook, it has Windows 8.1 and the whole touch screen experience, plus it has a standard desktop view. It comes with a docking station instead of having to buy it separately, and you can detach it and have an outstanding capacitive touchscreen tablet. The battery life is great, it has a built in camera and an HDMI port so that you can view on a TV.\n\nI did find a couple of things that weren't to my liking. It only has a 64G hard drive. But it does have an expansion port to increase the capability. I bought a 128G micro SD card. Also, the card does not fit flush with the case. It sticks out just a little which creates a risk of the card unmounting and falling out. I found a case for it that extends over the card slot so that it doesn't get bumped. But I put a small piece of clear tape over the card as a precaution. And there is only one USB port. I bought a multi port hub to remedy that.\n\nThere are newer models of this unit that sell for a lot more. But I didn't want to spend that much without knowing how well it worked. I have had this since Dec 2013 and I am quite happy with my purchase."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "Some of my friends cracked some jokes with me when I noted that this new shiny precious, while nice, would perhaps be a little nicer if it was a bit bigger.  Saying I wish it had another inch or two (of screen size and width for the keyboard) led to the infamous \"That's what she said\" and snickers at same.  Ah, juvenile humor ;-)\n\nSeriously though, I bought this item sight unseen, something that I rarely do.  I had been coveting this item for a while, but had also been wishing a bit for an alternate product, a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Dell-Venue-11-Pro/dp/B00FFVYUQY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Dell Venue 11 Pro</a>&nbsp;tablet.  I really went back and forth a good bit before purchasing, and almost snagged the DV11P but didn't thanks to lack of local inventory and a lack of follow-through on a promised \"trade-in\" offer at a competing retailer.  I went to the local retailer specifically to look at the DV11P (and possibly trade-in an older Windows XP laptop that was supposed to yield some credit in trade) and without having one there to see I went back to the office determined that I would probably purchase the DV11P.  That was the plan at least, until I dug through the reviews (here at Amazon) more and found myself questioning just how much I wanted that item and whether I should instead consider this item more instead.\n\nThe more I read the reviews, the more I was convinced that while the DV11P would have been nice, it would also have been a bit of a gamble and on top of that it would have meant spending more to get the keyboard and/or dock to go with it if I wanted those items (and yes, I would have wanted them).  All told, I would probably have dropped 2x the cost of this item on a DV11P and the associated accessories compared to what I invested here.\n\nI should note, I do own a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Dell-Venue-8-Pro/dp/B00FFVYV4K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Dell Venue 8 Pro</a>, along with an&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/ASUS-VivoBook-X202E/dp/B00AEEC2BM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">ASUS VivoBook X202E</a>&nbsp;(and I have gotten one of those for wife 2.0 who enjoys using her's) and a host of other devices that I could use that also includes a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Sony-VAIO-Fit-Series-14-Inch-Core-i7-Touch-Laptop/dp/B00CFGVJDO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Sony VAIO Fit Series 14-Inch Core i7 Touch Laptop</a>&nbsp;which is running Windows 8.1 (now the updated version of same).  Given this range of devices, I'm still -- to borrow from the U2 song a bit -- not finding what I'm apparently looking for, a nice two-in-one tablet device that would have say the screen size of the VivoBook X202E mentioned above, while also being easily broken down into a separate keyboard and touchscreen tablet.  Really, if the VivoBook X202E was a convertible device, it would be just what I think I want, but then again it would likely leave me wishing that it was perhaps a bit skinnier and more compact so it would be easier to carry around :-/  D'oh, just can't seem to find my own happy place with these devices.\n\nAfter getting this device and getting a look at the keyboard, I can see why some of the others here have suggested the keyboard is a bit disappointing.  The smaller shift key on the right side of the keyboard is frustrating.  A little more width to the keyboard would have fixed that (I think).  It also would have resulted in - hopefully - slightly large keys all around.  It would have taken much there for me, but just a little more would have been nice.  What is here is usable, just not quite as much as I'd like (there's the opportunity for another 'that's what she said' comment to spring forth :-/ )\n\nThe screen itself is nice.  Again, perhaps a little under-sized for what I had expected and hoped for, but not bad.  It is nicer than the LCD display (non-IPS) that the X202E has.  That particular screen is one that is best seen directly (head-on).  Viewing from the side offends the eyes of some that are easily bothered by such things (not that I notice it that much, but I know a few individuals that are bothered by the side viewing angles when looking at that screen, so I do recognize it can be a problem).  That is not at all a problem with the beautiful IPS display that is included on this tablet.  The display on this item looks good from virtually any angle (except, obviously, from behind the display :-p )\n\nThe resolution is close to the same as I have on the DV8P, but in a larger screen that is easier to read and easier to touch the gadgets on when I'm trying to control things back in Windows 8.x's desktop mode.\n\nHaving the touchpad on the keyboard dock here gives a user full mouse control where desired and eliminates any concern about having to lug additional accessories around as I might (and do to some extent) when I'm carrying the DV8P around.  No need for a mouse, no need to carry around the stylus.  No need to carry around a keyboard (such as the Microsoft Wedge keyboard that I have to use with that device).\n\nI wish that this device had about 2x the storage capacity (128GB would be pretty nice, compared to the 64GB, with roughly 37GB of user space available) built-in, and I also wish it had a bit more memory included, though Windows 8 (or Windows 8.1) runs well enough in the included 2GB of built-in RAM.\n\nI would note that the build quality is good for this device, perhaps into the nice range, though there are a few things to mention.  First, when I moved the MicroSD card that I had been using with the DV8P over to this device I found that the MicroSD card sticks out a bit and easily nudged to the point that I have concerns I could lose the memory card by carrying this transformer book around and simply brushing up against the memory card as it sticks out on the side of tablet.\n\nSimilarly, I'm a bit disappointed/frustrated that the \"power button\" on the tablet is recessed more than I'd like making it a bit harder to press and use.  I expect that the power button should be easier to make use of (it is very easy to use on the DV8P and most other tablets that I have used).  It can be used on this tablet, but it is not something that I can just reach up/back and press lightly.  Instead it requires a bit more effort to insure that I'm hitting the button and making good contact with it.\n\nThe plastic/carbon fiber type case on the back of the tablet is a virtual magnet for oily finger prints (as is the IPS display on the tablet).  It has a bit of a slick feel to it and might leave you concerned that you'd let the tablet slip through your fingers more easily than you wish.\n\nThe keyboard sits sturdily enough when the tablet is snapped into place.  The tablet also snaps out easily enough.  When snapped into place, the tablet portion stands easily and offers enough ability to adjust the pitch to make it easy enough to view the screen while typing or using the touchpad.\n\nAll told, I like this device, but would note that I would admit to a bit of buyers remorse.  Really, if the screen and keyboard were just a little bigger, I would probably have called myself ecstatic with my purchase.  As is, I would say that I had some thoughts that I might wind up doing as a friend does and let this one go at a bit of a bargain price so I could instead invest in another alternative.  For now I'm gonna keep it and let the purchase grow on me a bit."}

I am quite computer software literate, but do not know much about technical aspects.  I think this tablet has areas which are less sensitive to touch than others.  Microsoft chose to put the x to close a program or window in the same area where one could get to the \"command bar\" that pops up when swiping from the right of the screen.  On the tablet, when I try to close the app (or program as it used to be called), the command bar pops up, instead of closing the window.  The popup keyboard is in the all the time. Since I am not a touch typist, I have to open and close the keyboard all the time to see what I am typing.  That is annoying.  Surely the OS can shrink the program or website to eliminate this overlap?  Also, a right click with a mouse on a mistyped word is NOT replaced by a tap on the word, because that brings up the keyboard.  For some reason re-sizing is not available for all websites as it is in my phone.  Whether these are Asus or Windows issues I do not know, but I am not going to hang around long enough to eventually see enough improvements to let me keep using an OS that is forever following and never quite leading or having its own strengths."}

Overall the unit feels study and when the screen is docked in the keyboard the attachment feels just as study as any laptop I have used. The only time I every thought that the transformer felt cheap is when I felt the roughness of the bottom of the screen where it docks, they could have smoothed out that area a little more.

This improved its performance massively.\nThere are quirks to this unit. The keys are so close together ( I don't have huge hands) that hitting the wrong one is very easy, and it can sometimes result in bad things, like setting changing that I don't know how to change back. So be careful : )\nOften, is something is malfunctioning a Re-start will get you back on track.\nI would buy this Transformer netbook again, but wish I knew that setting it up and getting it performing well would take quite a bit of tinkering. I'm docking it a star for this issue.\n\nI read almost every review here before purchasing the ASUS T100TA a couple of weeks ago, so was familiar with most of the issues buyer have been facing. This is my first \"hybrid\" or netbook-size laptop, so I'm still getting used to the smaller keyboard and text display, yet the more I become familiar with its \"feel\", the less of an issue I think it will be. Learning MS 8.1 is also a challenge, as I just retired by 2003 IBM T43 dinosaur which ran XP, but that is to be expected.  I found the set-up for this unit  pretty straight-forward. I'm no I.T. geek, but I can get around a computer decently enough, and I had no problem updating the BIOS, installing virus protection, and other updates. I did change MS updates to let me decide when or if to install them, which may be a very good thing for all users of this unit to do. Based on other reviews I recently got a Bluetooth mouse: HP X4000b Bluetooth Mouse (H3T51AA#ABC) for about $20 which has made navigating this little screen way, way easier. I bought ASUS \"used\" here on Amazon for $308, but it arrived looking nothing but new. Yes, the Right Shift key is small and takes so getting used to, but it's not as big a deal as many have made it out to be. $307 for a zippy little tablet/laptop? Ohhh yeah!  I'm diggin this sucker, and with more practice expect to love it even more."}

The ASUS Transformer Book was great for this. It came loaded with Microsoft Office software (including Word) and also Kindle, plus a bunch of other stuff. The screen detaches easily for me to use as an e-reader or tablet. I thought the smaller keyboard may be a problem, but it wasn't. However, if you have big hands/fingers, this could be a problem for you. People at my local library are jealous of my Transformer Book. A friend was able to plug in her thumb drive for me to get some files to edit for her. Worked great. Plus, found out that my husband can watch Netflix on our larger TV screen while I watch something else through Netflix on my Transformer. I also use it to surf the web. I like the freedom of sitting anywhere in the house or outside or the library, and not being tied down to a desk."}

Asus! This is my first time purchasing an Asus product and thus far I am extremely pleased. This tablet exceeds my expectations.\n\nI have no complaints since I bought the T100 32 gig model a little over a week now. All functions of this device work well from battery, to charging time, the precision and responsiveness of the touch screen, the touch pad, etc. Overall, the performance of this tablet is excellent, it's very speedy running apps as well as full size software programs although I have not installed any heavy duty resource consuming software programs either, but with Intel's newest Bay Trail quad core processor, I don't anticipate having any issues for every day computing tasks using typical software applications including Microsoft games like solitaire and mahong.\n\nI also have a 7inch android tablet that has an Nvidia Tegra 3 quad core processor which runs superbly fast, but I needed and wanted a larger screen windows 8 tablet with similar hardware specs of my android device. So quad core processor, at least 2 gig of ram, bluetooth, mini or micro hdmi port etc. And then, getting a docking keyboard along with a full size USB port is a definite plus along with MS office home and student as part of the package. This sealed the deal for me.\n\nI really enjoy using windows 8 on a tablet, whereas before when I used windows 8 on non-touch PC's I did not like the experience so much. Now that I am using the T100 tablet/laptop, I can appreciate the logic of the hybrid OS design that Microsoft created because I am essentially using a hybrid touch screen device thus unleashing the full capabilities of windows 8 and this has resulted in a positive end user experience for me. I have been using this tablet every day since I bought it! It's hard to put it down and now I am not even interested in using my older high end dell laptop with windows 7 or my high performing android tablet anymore.\n\nFor those of you who do not feel comfortable typing on the smaller T100 keyboard (and this will mostly be guys) I recommend using a full size Bluetooth keyboard. At least you could use a full size Bluetooth keyboard at home, although it may not be practical for travel. I paired one of my bluetooth keyboards to test the bluetooth feature on the tablet and it worked like a charm. I have not experienced any adverse hardware issues at this point, knock on wood.\n\nOverall the Asus Transformer T100 is a lovely gem of a tablet for the price!"}

Love that, unlike many other hybrids, the keyboard and dock are solid, so you can use it on your lap. A hybrid like Surface seems to mostly come with flexible keyboard covers, so you need to place them on a solid surface like a desk. Setup went well, battery life seems good. took a star off for two reasons. First, one time it seemed to not properly go to sleep, and the battery completely discharged from about 80% full to dead while the device was not in use, over the course of a couple days. It should have gone to sleep.  Second, the micro SD card wasn't working right for copying a large number of files to it - after a few minutes of copying files (slowly), it threw an error message and stopped. After I copied the files to the card, I was able to access them and update them from the slot, but for the actual copying to the card I had to use a USB adapter."}

It does charge very slowly, which can be annoying when you're low on battery, as it doesn't charge it quickly enough to keep the power on.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "Just before Christmas, I saw advertisements all over London for this laptop/tablet. I fell for the marketing campaign and despite not being able to find one in a store to actually look at, I ordered two of them from Amazon. One for me and one for my partner.  My bad for not immediately opening it up and using it, but I waited until Christmas day and then only had one week to play with it before embarking on several months of overseas travel. I've been using it as my primary computer/internet connection for three months now.  Admittedly, I seem to be a slow adapter to Windows8. I hate it and find it clumsy and illogical to use. Of course, that's not Asus' fault but what is Asus' fault is the fact that my screen spontaneously jumps from one window or program to another. I'll be in the middle of writing an email, for example, and 'poof' I'm dumped out of email and find myself staring at the desktop.  Thanks to the way windows 8 is set up, it takes several clicks to return to where I was in my email. Then, 'poof' it happens again. This is a regular feature of this computer. Jump and dump the user from where she wants to be to somewhere else which requires several clicks to recover from. As mentioned, this happens while in email, it happens when surfing the web and when moving between pdf and word documents.  Another problem is the on/off button. It's not responsive so you have to keep repressing it, holding it down and eventually it may work. Or, it will embed itself into its socket and refuse to pop back up so out come the tweezers to pull it out so the machine can be powered up or down.  Then, when powering down, the machine will turn on the camera. What??!! I didn't ever even use the camera so why is the little camera indicator light coming on only when the machine is turned off? It took me several days to realize that this was happening. The good news is that there is now an explanation for why the battery would drain overnight if not plugged in. The bad news is that it has continued to happen every time I shut down for 3 months. The fix is to wait until the machine has finished the rest of the shutdown process and then press that finicky on/off button again and hold it for 5-10 seconds until the camera light also shuts down. Then the battery is preserved. I will give the battery its due, when in use it does have a long life. I can use the machine for pretty much all day without having to plug it in which is good because, as others have noted, the recharging cord is so short that you have to work right next to an outlet in order to have the machine plugged in. That's a fairly minor annoyance since the battery life is pretty good. (Note, I found that the cord is the same as the one for my kindle paperwhite which is much longer so I use that one if I need to work on the computer while it is plugged in)  That said, I have noticed that when I am not plugged in, the screen will dim for no reason - touching it or typing does not prevent or reverse this dimness. It will brighten up again on its own when it is ready. Those are the most compelling problems I've encountered. Other reviewers have covered much more thoroughly the other pros and cons of this machine. In fairness, I will note that my partner's machine seems not to suffer from the same afflictions that mine does (it is also used much less frequently) but my father bought himself one of these too - after seeing ours at Christmas. He returned his within a week because it had the same on/off button problem that mine has. He bought something else and is very happy with it. I'm going to replace mine as soon as I get the chance. Other reviewers have noted that this is a decent machine for travel, sound quality and light use but is not recommended to be used as your primary computer. I'd have to agree - in my opinion, it is too frustrating for frequent use. It's a pity though because I really did want to love it but I think I'm going to try an apple instead."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "Okay i have had this product for a few months and there are a few things I would have liked to have known before purchasing it, but all together this is a great laptop for recreation and as a second computer to be taken to school or work.\n\nOne thing about this computer is the trick of powering it on. About two days after i received it, it would not come on no matter what i did. I looked online and eventually found that it suffers from an issue called something like deep sleep mode and requires that you hold the power button for fifteen seconds, let go, and then hold it again until the asus screen pops up. Now that i know the trick, there are no problems.\n\nAnother thing is the outrageously, and sometimes comically, short charging cable. It can not be larger than three feet, which may sound like plenty but can be quite a problem when you have to rearrange all of the people sitting at the table with you so that you can be close enough to the outlet to plug in. I have moved more giant tables, and rearranged whole groups of friends and laboratory partners just to be able to charge it. The good thing is the battery life is incredible so if you charge it the night before you likely won't need a charger. I have used it on a full charge heavily throughout a day starting at 8 in the morning and still had 30% of battery life left at six at night. Having said that, I don't know if there are extensions out there but if so, get one!\n\nAnother thing, which is to be expected with such a small device, is the small size of the keyboard. you get used to it, but it is different and requires practice. I also have large hands.\n\nThis is not a computer that really can be used comfortably on your lap as it often feels top heavy and threatens to fall backwards. There is no issue in the slightest if you leave it on a desk or convert to tablet mode. Im not saying It can not be done, as i often do use it on my lap, but it feels unnerving, and you kind of have to keep your palms on it at all times to keep it from falling backwards like a scuba diver.\n\nAll together this is a great little device, and i highly recommend for students who will be carrying in backpack as it is remarkably light and small and fits perfectly in a backpack (or purse i would think)."}

I have been on it for 3 or so hours now and it has been running perfect. I had to go thru the same thing when I first picked Windows 8, 2 years ago.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "This is my first tablet/laptop, so I have no previous experience with the product line, much less other brands.  I have always relied on desktop PC's in a home office atmosphere, and still prefer that scenario.  I considered myself above average when it came to understanding and working with PC's that were running Microsoft Windows operating systems; that is until Windows 8 came along.  I decided it was past time to upgrade everything in my home to Windows 8.1, which includes purchasing a new desktop.  Before investing in new desktop equipment for my office, I wanted to first purchase a notebook/tablet/laptop that was running Windows 8.1.  It seemed like a great way to learn Windows 8.1.\n\nBefore buying this ASUS Transformer Book T100TA, I had been doing off/on research on laptops and tablets over the past couple of months.  Besides Amazon reviews on various brands, I have been reading a lot of other reviews on internet websites like CNET and PC Magazine.  When it came time for my decision, I went with the notebook that gave me the best value for the price.  And no other notebook came close in price or value when you took into consideration the addition of a detachable keyboard, a Windows 8.1 operating system, the 64 GB storage drive, 2013 Microsoft Office Home & Student software, and the number of connectability options.  I always came back to this model of ASUS during my research, so I just finally pulled the trigger and bought it.\n\nI have had it now for a week, and I am enjoying it.  Even though you can turn this into a tablet, I still find myself setting in my recliner with it in my lap and using the attachable keyboard.  Personally, I am having no issues with a small keyboard, weight, screen illumination, etc., etc..  And the quality of the tablet and the keyboard seem to be above average and on par with other tablets, laptops, etc..  So again, not an issue for me.  I am not fond of using the touch pad, but then I never liked using it on any of the laptops I carried around with me at work either.  Even though the touch pad works fine on this notebook, I prefer using the on-screen keyboard, the attachable keyboard, or, the touch screen.  I just don't really need the touch pad.  But like I said earlier, this is my first notebook/laptop.  The biggest issue so far for me with this notebook is Windows 8.1.  After a week of playing around with it, today I ordered the book \"Windows 8.1 For Dummies\" from Amazon.  I do not have the patience or time to learn something through trial and error, so just buy the damn book!\n\nI had no issues downloading the Windows updates or the ASUS updates, and there are quite a few.  First, I would recommend charging this for eight hours before using it.  And even though the battery may be fully charged, I would still keep it plugged into the charging dock while you are downloading the initial updates from Windows and ASUS.\n\nI would highly recommend this ASUS T100TA Notebook to anybody who is looking for the \"best value\" in a tablet/notebook that can offer performance along with the capability for a wider range of usages\n\nREVIEW UPDATE 7/22/2015 - REDUCING STARS\n\nI have enjoyed this tablet a lot over the past year, BUT I am now having problems with the communication between the keyboard and the tablet.  I get a driver error message and it makes the keyboard unusable.  I have to disconnect the tablet from the keyboard to get it to work again, but the error message about the unrecognized driver always comes back again.  This just started in the past week.  I very seldom have taken the tablet off of the keyboard, so I do not believe it is due to overuse or misuse by disconnecting the two of them constantly.  This looks like either a cheap keyboard issue, or, the USB driver is already failing.  This is not good for a tablet that is only 15 months old.  I did contact their tech support and they responded after a couple of days by sending me a web link to download the file with all of the drivers for this notebook myself.  But I do not want to replace all of the drivers, just the one that is bad.  Anyway, for this reason I am knocking this tablet down to 3-Stars just on quality."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I bought this at Best Buy considerably cheaper, so my first piece of advice would be to check there before ordering through Amazon (I would not have paid nor is it worth more than the $349 I paid for it).\n\nI decided to try out the idea of a transformer after my less than 2 year old laptop broke- one of the screen clips broke completely off and I was given a $200+ quote to get it fixed, so I figured I might as well get a new computer and didn't want to have to deal with that again. The idea of the transformer took care of that, so I decided to branch out and give it a shot.\n\n- GENERAL: I spend a lot of time uploading/editing photos, and this computer just isn't practical for that. With only the 2GB memory, just adding 40 pictures temporarily to my downloads folder between editing and transferring to my flash drive slows the computer down to the point that I can't even edit the pictures (I use online editing software, so that's not what's slowing it down).\n\n- GENERAL: I'm someone who keeps everything stored on a flash drive, and I've also never been a fan of the laptop mouse, so I always have a traditional USB mouse plugged in. With this computer, I can't have the mouse and flash drive plugged in at the same time since there is only 1 USB port, which makes editing photos and saving anything to the flash drive that much harder.\n\n- GENERAL: I really don't see the point in having a touch screen when it's being used in the form of a laptop (with the keyboard connected). Probably my favorite feature is the ability to go back and forth between tablet/laptop form, and the touch screen does respond well. However, it is almost too big to be used as a tablet in my opinion. It is heavy and hard to hold with one hand.\n\n- GENERAL: Because of the small size of the computer itself, I find it hard to type on the keyboard. Some of the keys are in different places than what I'm used to, and it's hard to type using the \"home row\" keys if that's what you're used to. It can be done, but not without looking at the keyboard while you type or doing a lot of deleting.\n\n- CON: I'm sure this can be switched out with another cord, but the USB charger cord it comes with is WAY too short. My outlet and the arm of my couch is only an end table's distance apart and the cord barely reaches.\n\n- PRO: Battery life does seem to last about 8 hours.\n\n- PRO: This thing has AMAZING sound quality and speakers!\n\nI decided to return it to Best Buy after a little more than a week, for a few reasons. 1) It just wasn't practical for what I need a computer for. 2) I was having a LOT of issues getting it to turn on and off- pushing the power button and nothing would happen. It took several tries to get it to turn on. That was frustrating enough for me not to want to deal with it- that's not what I paid $350 for.\n\nOverall, based on the reviews (which is part of the reason I chose to buy this computer to begin with) and the guys at Best Buy backing them up (they were surprised to see it getting returned, but agreed that the powering on/off issue was probably a defect), I would still recommend this computer if it is not your ONLY/MAIN computer. I can see it being nice for travel and it is very convenient to have around in terms of how portable it is. It was also a good music source. I just don't think it's very practical for everyday use, even for people like me who use their laptop for simple things like surfing the web and Facebook."}

I've had my Asus T100 tablet for about 2 weeks now and I am so happy with it. I'm glad I did a lot of research prior to making a purchase because I got the right product. The product is compact but still feels like and works like a computer that I can get real work done on. I already have an Ipad, but I have office work to do using Microsoft Office and the Ipad doesn't do the job. I was able to load my Microsoft Office 2010 package as well as a couple of other software packages. The choice to type or touch the screen works well and the T100 is small enough for me to turn it sideways to read documents without removing the keyboard if I don't want to.\n\nThe only thing I'm disappointed about is that my USB modem doesn't work when plugged into the USB on this tablet. From my internet research, I've found that this is the case with other tablets too, not just the Asus T100. I already have a Cradlepoint Personal Hotspot that I purchased on Amazon.com that works with my USB modem so I will have to carry the hotspot at all times.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "After over a month of attempting a resolution with ASUS - started prior to the posting of this review - ASUS still places the cause of the issue on 2nd displays.  However, they acknowledge that it will work in 2nd display which is true.  However, all this demonstrates is that the display/monitor/HDMI port has the clear capability to display to a 2nd screen in full 16:9 display.  Their explanation is that it is not an issue with the T100 but the 2nd displays (many of them) which do not have the ability to adjust the display size to the output of the T100.  The flaw in this is that all 2nd displays actually display what is being transmitted to them via the HDMI connection based upon the SOURCE of the device that is sending the data/format to the 2nd display.  This is an automatic for 2nd displays regardless of what type of device is connected to the 2nd display including laptops, streaming devices (such as the Roku devices), set-top cable boxes, DVRs - anything connected via HDMI will, the 2nd display will automatically detect and display the content in the format it is being transmitted via the HDMI connection.  Duplicate display settings in the T100 should have no impact in this auto-detection and display on any device unless the T100 is only transmitting in 4:3 display size.  Since they are using a generic PnP display driver from 2006 prior to even Windows 7 much less Windows 8.1.  Their promotional videos show the T100 tablet displaying both on the tablet and 2nd display (a large flat-screen TV) perfectly in 2nd display.  For some strange reason ASUS will not all their employees to provide a contact phone number to anyone above the first level of tech/customer support or their US corporate offices.  Clearly they are not interested in resolving this although it is a simple fix.\n\nAVOID if you will ever be using this to display to a 2nd display.\n\nOverall it is a great tablet for the price.  However, if you hope to connect it to a 2nd display such as a TV or monitor it will NOT display in 16:9 size (fill the full screen of the 2nd display) but only displays what is on your table screen about 2/3 of the size on the 2nd display.  The only way to see it full size on the 2nd screen is to choose the option of 2nd display only (shows on the 2nd display but not on the table at the same time).  This means that you can't use the touch feature, but have to connect the keyboard and use the mouse.  Plus you have to look at the 2nd display to click on things.  I find this useless as it is most common if you are giving a presentation your back is to the 2nd display and you can't see it to move your mouse around and click on things.  Also, why purchase a \"tablet\" instead of a touch screen notebook if you have to use the keyboard and can't use the touch feature on this tablet.\n\nThis is a known issue by ASUS but they don't point this out in any of their marketing of this unit nor do they have a fix for it and sounds like (at the time of this writing) that they plan on releasing a fix.\n\nSo if you will be using the HDMI port to display to a 2nd display avoid this item and look at other brands where the 2nd display option actually work correctly."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I had begun work on writing a series of novels at my desktop computer this winter. In the spring/summer/fall, I go camping almost every weekend but wanted to continue writing. Sitting at a computer connected to the internet causes so many distractions. I knew writing while camping would really help me concentrate. The problem I had was I needed something portable to write on that didn't require power. My laptop doesn't last more than a few hours, and the only way to charge a device would be to run my car while it's charging. I started researching tablets and found this one had amazing reviews and included a full keyboard, Windows 8, and MS Office. The article I read stated the battery would last 11 hours. It lasts far longer than that with continuous use.\n\nI bought it at a store, as it was on sale for $379. When I got it home, it turned on right away. The battery was low, but there was enough for it to turn on. I charged it up. I know you aren't supposed to do it that way, but I'm an impatient rule breaker. I was surprised at how nice it felt. It doesn't feel cheap or fragile at all, and the keyboard is very nice. I saw some reviews that said people had issues with the track pad, but I don't. I can type very fast on the keyboard. My first weekend with this device, I wrote 20,000 words. I will mention that I am a woman with small, feminine hands and I find this keyboard to fit my hands well, although sometimes I fat finger the shift/enter/arrow key area. If you have large hands, you will still be able to type, but maybe not as fast as me.\n\nThe battery life is just unbelievable. It lasted the whole weekend with heavy use without plugging it in. I am confident that I'll be able to take this camping with me and not have to worry about it dying.\n\nWhen I use this device, I feel like I'm in a movie with futuristic technology. I would definitely recommend it to anyone over any other device. It really has everything you need. If you want a small laptop for everyday things like browsing the internet, chatting, netflix on the go, etc, then this is for you. If you want an inexpensive computer for your kids, this is it. The quality you are getting over a full sized laptop of a similar price is much better. If you're looking for a tablet with the best battery life, this is the one."}

I then updated BIOS and did manual Windows update (which a reviewer suggested) and all went well for a short while.  I had the laptop for less than a week and I was liking it so far until I noticed two problems with it:\n\n(1) The Windows button on the tablet that is supposed to take you back to the Start screen just suddenly stopped working.  When I pressed it, it didn't do anything.  It worked previously.  (2)  The screen keyboard keeps popping up even though the docking station/keyboard was properly attached to the tablet.\n\nI contacted Asus tech support and they determined that I have to send it in for repairs.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "Well I must say I'm impressed with the amount of features I've got for relatively little money. I've bought it for working on travel missions abroad, and some multimedia use when travelling, so it conforms to these simple tasks 100%. I'm on the move very often and have been always torn between my 13.3 Acer lappy and 9.8 HP Touchpad - which one to bring with me - but now this device makes the choice redundant since it is those two rolled into one:)\n\nPros:\n- surprisingly light in combo form, tablet in itself is among the thinnest and lightest I've had;\n- great screen, so far the best screen I've been working with on a laptop/tablet;\n- keyboard/tablet mode is super, especially when you have to switch between travel and desktop work;\n- very nice audio for a tablet/laptop, although I've been spoiled by Beats audio on my other - apparently very old - tablet (HP Touchpad);\n- actually workable keyboard (I have small hands so I got used to it quickly);\n- Win8 and Office 13 included in price;\n- storage expansion slot makes it really versatile.\n\nCons:\n- the screen size is not something you want to use for the entire working day in office, productivity is very limited (and maybe not even intended in this form factor, to be fair) - I've tried it out of interest and mobility factor, but BYOD (bring your own device) application is ruled out for this device;\n- I believe myself to be fairly advanced with driver and firmware, but still cannot iron out all of the quirks, especially hibernation and wake up from sleep;\n- performance is initially surprisingly good at first glance, but the laptop chokes immediately when RAM-intensive tasks kick in, e.g. news posts with over 100 comments, stutters so much that this makes it unusable;\n- Win8 experience:( well can't get used to it no matter what.\n\nAll in all, once you understand the limitations of this device, you'll be happy with the amount of features it offers for the price. For me, the cons are far outweighed by pros of using it as a travel companion, where it performs admirably."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I feel bad rating this guy 2 stars, because I love ASUS, and it is a good piece of hardware. But the negatives are just too large, and the positives too small. Overall, I bought this device because I wanted both a laptop and a tablet, and I had neither. What I didn't realize is that, while this device is both a tablet and a laptop, it's not particularly great at being either.\n\nIN GENERAL\n\nPros\n1. Overall great design. It's ASUS, and they're used to making these great tablet/laptop computers\n\n2. Pretty nice Screen. Believe it or not I actually kinda like this screen more than my Nexus 10's screen. I know it's of less quality, but the pixel density makes more sense for watching HD video and stuff. Also, backgrounds look good on this thing as opposed to having to find the ridiculously absurd 2556x1600 picture size for the Nexus 10.\n\nCons\n1. Build quality is lacking. The volume buttons creak, and feel like they might come off or something. The lid doesn't feel like it fully closes with the help of gravity. The trackpad is god awful, and almost so annoying that I'd rather not use it at all (and I'm not generally a trackpad hater).\n\nWHEN USING AS A TABLET\n\nPROS\n1. Access to desktop mode in windows. This is actually really cool. I can't tell you how cool it is to actually run Ableton Live, or Photoshop, or a FULL version of Microsoft office, unadulterated and fully functional ON A TABLET. Obviously, it's not going to be the most powerful machine ever, but it's nice to have access to that kind of stuff while on the go with only a tablet.\n\n2. Great touch navigation in desktop mode. I was also really surprised to see find out just how well navigating desktop mode with touch works. I have no trouble opening and closing tabs in chrome, navigating through the file browser, or browsing web pages. Touch input seems to really have advanced in desktop mode, when compared to Windows 7, and I definitely give Microsoft Kudos for this.\n\nCONS\n1. The apps, man. The apps. The app store for Windows 8 is measly at best. I can't even begin to explain how bad it is, compared to android (which is what I'm used to for touch interfaces). When you find an app for a service that you need, it's usually not made by the developer of that service (i.e. youtube is \"touche for youtube\", and soundcloud is \"Clouder!\"). When it is made by the developer, it seems that they either have to submit entirely to Microsofts idea that every app can be squeezed into a 'modern' UI or work really hard to develop against the grain. I can't even explain how unnatural it feels to browse Amazon by scrolling through tiles horizontally, for example. Why Microsoft? Why can't you just let Amazon design their app the way they did for the other touch operating systems?\n\n2. Really piss poor UI. Just, in general, getting used to using Windows 8, especially in \"modern\" mode, is a troubling experience. I've experienced annoyance after annoyance. I can't stress this enough. I REALLY don't like it. Overall, the tablet side of things is so annoying, that I pretty much just never use it in tablet mode, even if I'm using it without the keyboard dock. I'd rather use desktop mode while using it as a tablet than use tablet mode, which is just a poor experience. Nuff said.\n\nWHEN USING AS A LAPTOP\n\nPROS\n\n1. Full Windows 8.1. This can absolutely not be understated for me. Having access to chrome, Adobe products, and all other windows desktop apps is necessary if you're going to get a windows tablet/laptop hybrid. You do NOT want to be stuck with just windows RT apps. If this was a Windows RT hybrid, I would not have been able to read any of my digital textbooks on this machine, as the touch version of the Kindle app doesn't even work with textbooks. Seriously, don't consider a windows RT computer. Just don't.\n\nCONS\n1. The keyboard is tiny. Like.. Really tiny. I knew it wasn't full sized, but I didn't realize that it would be THAT small. I have owned a netbook in the past made by Asus, and the keys, while small, were still easy and comfortable to type on. On this device however, I find myself making \"the claw\", because not only is the keyboard more narrow, but it's less deep as well. Meaning you don't really have to reach at all to reach the top row of keys. This makes it really difficult to take notes quickly, or type up papers, etc. BIG con for me.\n\n2. The speed, while much better than previous intel atom processors, is still not really that great. Yes, you're not going to have to wait like 15 seconds for chrome to open a new tab, but it's common to have to wait 2-3 seconds for text to catch up to what you just typed. It's also common to have apps take up to 10 seconds or so to start up. It's weird though, because it's not all the time, and sometimes it seems to be pretty responsive, but other times it's pretty annoyingly slow. I think overall this has more to do with windows that it does the machine itself.\n\n3. Bare minimum screen size. While the screen real estate (the amount that you can see on the scree) is pretty great, the size of the screen (the physical size that is) is pretty small and will definitely take some time getting used to. Having 1368x768 pixels in just 10.1 inches causes everything in desktop mode to be really tiny, and I find myself crouching in to get as close to the screen as possible most times. Granted, I have great vision, and I'd definitely prefer to be able to see many tiny words on a screen, than very few large words, but it's still fatiguing to use this in desktop mode for too long, and I've found that it definitely keeps from being as productive as I would like to be on it.\n\nAll in All, I've decided to return it and go with a more powerful and slightly larger hp detachable for $100 more. I'd still like to have it be able to convert into a tablet, just in case a good version of windows 8 does come out (there are rumors), I just don't want to put up with the negatives of having a tiny screen in laptop mode since the update is still in the air."}

In hindsight (always 20/20) I should have just returned it to amazon.  3 weeks later I had a computer that should be fully functional.\n\nUnfortunately, half the keys on the keyboard would not work. They had broken my keyboard.  Again, I had to engage customer service.  I was asked to mail it back.  Sensing my aggravation, Asus offered to mail me a keyboard. This is where things get ugly.  They mailed me internal hardware for the computer. They expected me to take the computer apart and replace this hardware. I was shocked.  Calls to the customer service resulted in an escalation to a manager. Devoui was his name. I was informed that replacing the internal hardware myself would void the warranty!

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I love my transformer. This was my first user experience with Windows 8, especially in a \"tablet\" format. It took a little getting used to the touch screen and the ease of navigating like I was used to with a mouse on a desktop or regular laptop. However, after I learned to \"sweep in\" a touch menu from the screen edges, it really became easy to move around. Removing or returning the screen from/to the keyboard is a piece of cake and when coupled, the lock mechanism is really sturdy. This computer is so small, thin and light compared to my \"fat\" laptop that I can tuck the unit behind my back into my belt and be hands free while walking around. I even got it with Office 2013 for times when I want to use that function. This is a full function Windows 8 laptop which can be almost instantly converted to a tablet--just push the lock button to remove the screen. I use the transformer mostly for times when it's inconvenient or not possible to use a full sized desktop or laptop, like when taking a trip. Then, it's just very convenient for web browsing, checking e-mail, and playing some games, but I can also do real work if necessary (nothing CPU or memory intensive mind you). The battery life is great, too. The only downside I can see is when the battery dies in the future. The only way to get to the battery is to disassemble the case, etc. and disconnect several wires in the process. Not too hard, as I've already watched a YouTube video on how to do it, but kind of a pain compared to swapping batteries in a normal laptop."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "The T100T 64 GB is an amazing product.  It is easily one of the most affordable, flexible and productive tools I ever purchased.  I wanted a Windows device I could use in several scenarios; 1).  Like a desktop with the T100 connected to external monitor, keyboard and mouse, 2).  As a lightweight laptop for office, home and elsewhere, and 3). As a tablet when I wanted the lightest carry weight possible.  The T100 performs each role superbly, so much so in fact that for many people it might be the only PC they need. I'll elaborate on the usage cases.\n\n1). Desktop Mode - To perform this role well the T100 must be able to easily automatically use the native resolution of the external monitor instead of the T100's own monitor which is 1366x768.  And it needs to connect to all of one's peripherals.  The T100 functions in this mode perfectly.  You will need a Micro-HDMI to HDMI/DVI cable that matches your external monitor's inputs.  You should also have a 4 port (or more) USB 3.0 hub for your keyboard, mouse, backup drive, flash drives etc.  Once you have these when you arrive at your office you plug the USB 3.0 hub into the T100's USB 3.0 port, the Micro-HDMI cable and Micro-USB charging cable and your done.  Using the T100's F8 button you can select which monitor to deliver the image.  If you want the best resolution of your external monitor choose \"external monitor\" only.\n\n2.  Laptop Mode - With keyboard attached the T100 offers a wide range of tilt levels and the mechanical stability of the device is solid.  When connected the two piece unit feels solid like a single unit and one can easily carry the device holding the keyboard only.  What is equally impressive is how smooth and precise the touchpad is.  It supports two finger gestures and is a delight to use. The touchpad greatly exceeds my expectations.  Of course, battery life is great and one can use this all day long.  For laptop mode I recommend getting one of the leather or leather-like cases that protects the unit.\n\n3). Tablet Mode - This is as simple as it gets.  The T100 continues to perform superbly, the IPS display delivers rich color and the resolution is just about right to use most desktop applications.  The speed and responsiveness of the unit is great.  My one complaint is that the smooth material on the tablet is a fingerprint magnet.  Would have liked for the unit to have used the same texture as the bottom of the keyboard but for some reason Asus didn't do that.  In any case if you have a protective case this isn't an issue anyway.\n\nSetup Information:\nWhen the new system was first purchased I expected to begin setting up Windows and during the process the Asus Live Update package launched and began automatically downloading and installing Asus specific updates.  I'm OK with this but I just wasn't expecting it.  Asus could have done a better job describing how their update would work.  The update installs BIOS/UEFI updates and drivers and this requires the system to restart multiple times and some times the screen is dark for a while.  To many people this could appear that the machine is unresponsive or even broken, but have patience the updates are happening in the background.  Leave the device plugged-in and let it do all the restarts, it should work beautifully after that.\n\nSummary:\n\nWith MS Office included this package is incredibly useful and one of the most versatile Windows devices I've ever seen.  I've tested the T100 with MS Office, Skype (the Windows 7 version) and other applications and they all work well.  The built-in camera works fine with Skype in widescreen mode.  If you want to deliver a better video image while in desktop mode attach a Logitech camera and the outbound picture is stellar.  The Intel Bay Trail processor is powerful and can easily handle it.\n\nThe T100 is unique in its category.  I know of no device near its $399 retail price that performs so many roles so well and is light enough to take anywhere and can be used for most desktop, laptop and tablet tasks people perform every day.\n\nUseful Accessories:\n\n1.  Protective case\n2.  USB 3.0 Hub\n3.  64GB SDXC Card for extra on-board storage\n4.  A USB charging cord that is longer than the short one provided\n5.  External DVD drive\n\nRecommended Software:\n1.  EaseUS ToDo Home version ( free software) for backing up your system\n2.  Asus' Backtracker software for those that have the 64GB model and want to move the restore partition off the main storage"}

Really?\n\nSo after all the issues described below, I returned my netbook, everything was in the original packaging and all inserts.  I was very unpleasantly surprised that I got deducted $100 dlls from my purchase price for \"restocking\" fee.  Really?  That is 20% of the purchase price.  That is quite a high fee for a netbook that was not working correctly!.  I am very upset and will be very weary of purchasing any more electronics thru amazon.com\n\n*** ORIGINAL REVIEW ***\nReturned due to several issues\n\nFirst, let me say that I really wanted to love this netbook. Touchscreen, netbook, windows 8, what more could you ask?\n\nHowever, in the first month I kept having issues with the screen freezing or everything just crawling.  Another issue was the \"on\" button would not work sometimes. And most recently the charger gets very hot, so I cannot leave plugged in for enough time to charge it.\n\nI like that the battery lasts 11 hours, but it does require a long time to charge, no problem if you are consistent with using it during the day and leaving it plugged in all night.\n\nI do not think you can turn it on while charging though, but maybe that is this particular issue I was having with the \"on\" button. I looked on the internet and there is a way to \"reset\" the start by pressing two buttons at once, and the reset worked once but after that it did not work.\n\nAnyway, I really liked the size, battery life, touchscreen/netbook and windows 8 features, but I was hoping not to have so many little issues on the first month of usage. I returned as soon as the charger issue started as I did not want to wait longer and loose my return window."}

The Baytrail Quadcore processor can handle downloads and multiple screens with streaming content quite easily while maintaining adequate speed. The touchscreen is very responsive as is the keyboard dock. The added bonus of full Microsoft office assures my productivity needs are met and the $399 price point was perfect. I can live with the 768p screen because it is still HD (though not full HD) and is a LCD IPS screen which is amazing technology. all in all I really couldn't have found a better tablet for work or play anywhere else."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "This tablet is absolutely fantastic for the price. I've had it for 2 months now and haven't had any issues with it whatsoever. It comes with the keyboard dock which is a huge plus over other tablets since you usually have to buy it separately. It comes with Microsoft office which is awesome since I'm a student. The processor is pretty speedy, close to what you would get out of a similarly priced laptop. It is even good enough for me to play world of warcraft. There isn't enough storage to download it though so if you plan to have large files, a micro SD card or external hard drive is a good idea. It has an HDMI output so you can hook it up to a TV or computer monitor. There is also a USB port so you can do things like charge your phone off it. My only complaint is how short the charging cable is... about 3 feet long. The wall adapter it comes with is great though. It charges the tablet well, so make sure to use the one it comes with or it will take forever to charge. Battery life is great too. I'm good for 8 hours or so of light use before I have to recharge it. Overall this tablet is a great buy. Definitely worth it for the ~$350 or so it cost."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I want to make this perfectly clear off the bat: this is a fantastic product, especially for the price. I have a few issues with it, but the pros DEFINITELY outweigh the cons. I'm going to go through this review piece by piece, so you can scroll to the bottom if you just want pros and cons.\n\nAS A COMPUTER- I am absolutely thrilled that this little thing includes full windows 8.1 and has full Office 2013. When plugged into the dock, it functions basically just like one of the older netbooks that used to be so popular. The keyboard is solid, aluminum plated on both sides, but noticeably cramped. The screen/tablet section wiggles a little in its seat, which is worrying, but overall it is very solid. I got this as a basic \"satellite\" computer to take notes on, then go back and use my desktop for any heavy lifting, and for that, it is absolutely perfect. Office 2013 is really smooth and opens quickly(3-7 seconds, much faster than past editions of office), but as I said, the cramped keyboard will take some getting used to. While it is no nexus 7, I really cant gripe about resolution all that much, the screen is actually pretty nice. The touchpad is, like many netbooks, pretty aggravating to work with, but I am getting used to it, and it really isn't BAD, just much smaller than I'm used to. Running multiple tabs seems to work, but if I run more than 4-5 tabs while running say, a windows app in the background, it starts to get bogged down. Youtube videos are great, they play smoothly and just as well as on my gaming desktop. You won't get much gaming out of this little guy, but what can you expect out of such a low power processor? Bottom line on the PC side: I don't recommend this as a primary computer, but it will definitely go the extra mile as a sidekick for your primary PC.\n\nAS A TABLET: Despite all of the complaints about windows 8.1, this kind of computer is exactly what 8.1 is designed for. All those features which are incredibly annoying on a non-touch PC? Well now, they actually make sense, and are actually pretty nice. In regular desktop mode, working the tablet purely through touch is kind of infuriating, as the buttons are way too small to press with your finger, but if you stick to the infamous \"start screen\" when in tablet mode, this thing is a dream. apps scroll smoothly, touch is responsive and intuitive, I can read through kindle or watch movies through netflix, and while the windows app store is quite limited, I can generally find what I need without having to pay for it. BATTERY LIFE.... oh man, the battery life on this thing is heavenly. *remember to leave it charging overnight* and you will have a computer/tablet that will last you a solid ten hours of use. I can leave it charging overnight and not have to worry about carrying my charge cable, and that is pretty great. Speaking of the cable, the charger is a bit short, ~2 or 3 feet, but, like I said, you can just leave it charging overnight and you won't have a problem.\n\nPROBLEMS/IMPROVEMENTS: Don't get me wrong when I say that this thing is absolutely great, but it does have its downfalls. I have the 32gb version and the formatted hard drive space is only around ten gigs, which, quite frankly, is pretty pitiful. I'll get a 64gb microsd soon to solve that, but a 20 gig OS? really? I feel like they could have easily added at least one more USB, or even better, added one to the actual tablet.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: This little guy won't do much gaming, but it holds its own both as a tablet and as a netbook, and the included Office 2013 suite is hard to beat. The keyboard is cramped, but I have to admit it is pretty high quality. It charges slowly, so I recommend just leaving it overnight. While I don't recommend you have this as your only computer, it really is a killer deal, and does a heck of a job as a basic netbook with a few extra bells and whistles(like being a FREAKING TABLET)."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I had this product for all of 2 months.  It appears to be a great deal.  However, the tablet didn't sit very well within the keyboard so it always took some pushing.  Along with that, the on keyboard mouse was pretty useless as it was a bit unresponsive and often movements I tried to make were imprecise or changed screens on me without my intention.  I practically only used as a tablet but the onscreen keyboard takes up so much space it's hard to work effectively with it in excel, etc.\n\nWell, this morning I went to dock it into the keyboard base and as I pushed it in a tiny crack was induced in the screen right near where the left insert to the base is located.  Of course, shortly after, the crack now runs from top to bottom of the screen and the tablet is unusable.  I call Asus, naively expecting an apology and a path to get this thing fixed ASAP.  What I got, even after talking to a manager (Mikhael) was to be informed that my warranty has been invalidated due to physical damage and that my only course to fix was to send to them, at my cost, get repaired, at my cost, and sent back to me, at my cost.  It was like talking to robots.  I guess I'm just another jerk that cracks his screen for fun and tries to claim it's a warranty item.  Absolutely no concern for them about the image that this review would give the product or Asus or that I wouldn't ever buy another product from asus as long as I live.  There isn't even another phone number they could suggest to call.  Got same answer on online chat...\n\nIronically, I'm writing this on my ipad that I've had for 3yrs and never had the slightest issue with.  Anyway, this product is cheap, the customer care is even cheaper, and unless you have a lot of time to waste, I would stay away from Asus products by any name (Nexus, etc.).  They're not local, their a pain to deal with, they have robots working in customer service, they don't care at all, and their products are cheap in quality and design.  I hope they lose all their business."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I had some reluctance, partly because of the low price for a full Windows machine. Now I am convinced if MS took their Windows Surface RT and used Windows 8.1 they would sell like pancakes at $500.\nHad some problem getting rid of a trojan file while setting up Google Chrome. Even though some time was lost, I went ahead and hit function/F9 which put it back to the factory condition. Started over and got Photoscape, and Chrome loaded and working great, along with a free download of BitDefender anti-virus.\nSure, the T100 is a little plasticy but still feels solid and durable enough for everyday use. The image quality is very good. I watched part of a movie on it and the clarity was impressive. Even the sound is not bad for something this size that you will likely be holding close to you most of time it is in use.\nThose with big fingers may find the keyboard a bit of a challenge, but for it's portability some trade off is expected. I recommend a Bluetooth mouse since there are basically only 2 USB ports available, one on the keyboard and one on the tablet. The HP 4000x works very well with it.\nBattery life is great! Office 2013 works great as well.\nThe connecting hinge is a very solid attachment. Get the mouse, a protective case, 2 adapter cables for the micro HDMI and USB ports on the tablet and you are all set. Make sure to get the 64gb version and remember it also takes micro SD cards for even more storage.\nSure, a rear camera and an additional battery for the keyboard would have been nice, but at this price I think Asus got the right stuff!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I originally purchased the ASUS Transformer Book T100TA-C1-GR with 10.1-Inch Detachable 2-in-1 Touchscreen & 64Gb of memory for my 9 year old daughter for Christmas. Amazon & the Microsoft Store sold it on or around Black Friday for $299. I never heard of the Asus T100 at that time but noticed it sold out quickly. I wait listed with Amazon & received it for $349 just before Christmas- a punctual delivery thanks to Amazon. I thought this would be a good computer for my daughter, whose school primarily uses Apple MacBook Pros & just started adding Microsoft Surface Pros. She prefers the version of Office with the Windows OS for most of her home/school work (after using both, I independently came to the same conclusion- it's a matter of taste I suppose). I mean what can you expect for that kind of money?\n\nAfter sharing this tablet/laptop for over 2 months, I found that my assumption was wrong. This is no toy. The Asus T100 is a great road warrior machine, with good battery life, Windows 8.1 OS, & a student version of Microsoft Office. This is much more suited for road work than a Chromebook because internet connections are uncertain in travel. There was a learning curve with 8.1, but it is short especially since it is configurable to boot to a more classic desktop (buried in settings on the Charm bar) & can quickly switch to metro if desired. I disagree with the critics/haters of WIN 8.1. It's all about choices & flexibility with the T100.\n\nMy old Asus road machine was the Asus 1000HE netbook. I liked the form factor for road work, but it lacked performance with the old sluggish Atom processor. The T100 uses a much quicker & more efficient quad core Atom. I believe it beats Celeron & behaves more like an i3. Not bad for a road machine rated for 11 hours of battery operation. However, the 1000HE does have some advantages over the T100. I can easily swap batteries, which is useful on long flights (e.g. NY to Hawaii with stops). I can replace/upgrade memory on the 1000HE mobo. I can replace the hard drive on the 1000HE. The T100 cannot do any of those things that the old 1000HE can! I suspect that the life of the T100 will be limited to those items that cannot be replaced- a disposable electronic. However, this is not exclusive to the T100. Competitors to the Asus T100 have the same limitations. I don't think these features should have been sacrificed just to keep it thin. I don't mind a road machine that is a little thicker if it is more capable & reliable. I also wish that it has a non glare screen like the 1000HE which is more desirable on a road warrior machine. I also would not throw the T100 around since the case is plastic. My 9 year old daughter has used it with no problems so far, but this machine is not designed for a gorilla or Neanderthal. At this price it is designed to be replaced, but it is a fraction of the cost of an Apple or MS Surface Pro. So far so good though.\n\nUseful accessories: I purchased a HooToo HT-UE01 3-Port USB 3.0 HUB with 10/100/1000 Gigabit Ethernet Converter for the T100 for $29, along with a Micro HDMI to HDMI Cable For Asus Eee Pad Transformer for $5, a Poetic SlimBook Case for ASUS Transformer Book T100 for $20, all from Amazon. All of those accessories work well with the T100. A 64 Gb micro SD memory card is less than $50 on Amazon & adds that much more to the existing 64 Gb for a total of 128 Gb, but it is slower than memory soldered on the mobo. I have retained my old netbook bag & mouse from the 1000HE, which fits the T100 perfectly & so did not have to purchase another. If you ever buy one of these, don't ever forget to update the BIOS- not difficult on the T100.\n\nMy daughter & I are very happy with the Asus T100. I wrote this review on my daughter's T100. I noticed that as of 22FEB2014, Amazon is selling the T100 for $75 above the Asus list price of $399. I presume they are in short supply. Update- as of 23FEB2014 AM, Amazon lowered the price to list ($399).\n2nd Update as of 23FEB2014 PM, Amazon raised the price to $475! Why? Probably supply & demand."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "This is an outstanding computer. I bought this little powerhouse, as a backup for my wifes laptop computer. She loves it. It does everything she likes to do on her laptop (surfing, e-mail, word processing etc.) and it is a lot more portable. She has had it now for about 3 months. As others have stated I too had problems when I first received this computer, especially during the initial set-up process. I was ready to take it back to the store for an exchange but decided to do some research on the internet about it first. I must say I am glad that I did that. I believe that ASUS was in such a hurry to get this new item out before Christmas that they lacked on the quality control. It was a gamble, but judging from the worldwide sales I guess it is paying off. I mean, what more could you ask for, this thing is a Laptop a Tablet and a Kindle. Once you update this computer correctly your problems will slowly go away. Here are some tips.\n\n1. Attach tablet to keyboard (listening for two faint clicks to make sure it is attached) and fully charge computer before any attempt to use it.\n2. Leave computer plugged in while going through the set-up process.\n3. During set-up when asked to go online skip that step and go back to it later.\n4. Once that process is done go in and set windows updates to check for updates but only install at your choosing.\n5. Now you can set up the computer to go online.  Find Asus Live Update Utility already installed on your computer and check for updates.\n6. You will probably see a list of updates that are needed, install the BIOS one first (the latest as of this review is 226) and then the others one at a time following any instructions that goes along with them.\n7. Go to PC settings and do a full recovery/ restore of Windows not refresh that only resets Windows while keeping your files intact. You want to put it back to factory settings. Think of it like tightening up a screw that came loose during transit.\n8. Go back to Asus Live Update to make sure the updates you installed are still okay. You will know if you keep clicking to check and nothing shows up. Bios is most important the rest you can put in later.\n9. Now go to Windows Update and install all updates one at a time.\n\nThese are just some of the things I did to get this computer running well. Hopefully it can help others. It may seem like a lot of work but, this computer is well worth it. Keep in mind that Asus is always sending down updates through the Live Update Utility to address problems and improve performance. Many of the concerns that customers have had previously with this computer have went away through Asus Updates and Windows Updates. If you can get this computer for anything less than $500.00 you have received a good deal. This is a fast computer with a lot of capabilities. It is just like any other computer the more you install on it the slower it gets. Realizing it has a small processor it is still very quick even after you add a few programs. Here are some other points or ideas.\n\n1. Microsoft Office is already installed; all you need to do is put in the accompanied code.\n2. Connects to any wireless printer using the same procedure as any windows computer.\n3. Can install a 64 GB Micro Scandisk Extreme plus SD card (the card does not stick out stays flush with the computer) for extra storage.\n4. It has a Long battery life and resent updates will improve recharging time.\n5. Display is good ( if you use reading glasses its even better)\n6. Use a computer skin or a leather / synthetic leather case to hide fingerprints on outer surface. The leather case will also act as padding.\n7. Use a stylus or screen cover to limit fingerprints on screen (my wife prefers the stylus).\n8. As mentioned earlier It can also be used like a Laptop, Tablet or a Kindle\n\nThere are a lot more things I could say about this computer but the bottom line, this is a keeper. Windows 8.1 is constantly improving as is this Asus Computer. Make sure you keep up with the updates. Research any problems online using reviews and YouTube before getting frustrated with this computer. There are a lot of tips out there about Windows 8.1 and this computer. You can spend $1000.00 on a new TV, $2000.00 on a new computer, $30,000.00 on a new car etc. and still have problems with them. Anytime something is mass produced there will be problems. Next year this computer will have more features and a bigger price tag. Why wait to pay for extra features that you probably will never use. Get it now at a low price."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "The 1st thing I noticed when I fired up the unit was that the CPU is a 1.33GHz CPU and Amazon has it listed as a 1.86GHz CPU in the specs. Not a real big deal, but I was expecting a faster CPU.\n\nThe touch screen was not very responsive and I had to press really hard to get the screen to respond. I had to run several driver and BIOS updates and that seemed to get the system to respond a little better. You would think that a new system would ship with the 10 or so updates I had to do already installed.\n\nAfter this was done the WiFi would either drop its connection when trying to connect at any speed higher than 65MB or it would lock up and I would have to hold the power button down until the unit would power down and boot it back up. The WiFi would be disabled when I would boot it back up and I would have to go in and turn the WiFi back on.\n\nThe Bluetooth would drop. I would have to constantly turn off the mouse and turn it back on to get it to reconnect.\n\nDid a system reset, updated and still had the same issues. Seeing that it takes a while to go through all this I decided to send it back and get a different product/brand that hopefully will come ready to go out of the box. A low price doesn't always mean its a good buy.\n\nThe touchpad was almost useless. The keyboard & speed was OK, but loading some adobe flash games online was really slow. The battery life, weight, and display were all good."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "After listening to the click of death in my previous laptop, I finally decided to take the plunge and pick up a T100.  I wanted one because #1 they are light and #2 they transform into a tablet.  I actually downgraded from a pretty heavy duty laptop as I wanted something that would be much easier to travel with.  This fit the bill perfectly.  I got the 64GB solid state drive version and at this price, it'd be hard to do any better, especially considering the fact that with a micro SD card, you can double the HD space for around $50.  I would also recommend picking up an external HD and a USB hub.  This is due to the fact that the base only has a single USB port.  I actually picked up a mouse as well.  After adding these things, I've got the perfect tablet for on the go and the perfect laptop for when I'm home working.  Total damage including laptop was around $480.  It'll be less if you have some of the things mentioned above, but I'd definitely recommend having them as they really increase the T100's attributes.\n\nI've hard that some people have issues with the keyboard, I haven't noticed anything wrong with the setup and I consider myself to have relatively large hands with something I call dumb finger syndrome.  A couple of my personal minor complaints are that the shift key is a bit small, it takes a minute to get used to hitting the right shift key as it's a bit out of place and smaller than a normal keyboard...obviously.  Also, the microphone in this thing is absolutely terrible.  Once again, not an issue as I just bought a pair of SkullCandy for like $20 which included a mic and this fixed the problem.  It didn't matter as I needed something for when I was in public anyways, but it should be noted that almost everybody has issues with the mic on this thing.  But at the price point, you can't have it all.  The mic with the SkullCandy actually makes Skype calls really crystal clear and much better than on my previous laptop.\n\nI've noticed that the WiFi is actually much more stable with whatever this thing has to connect to it.  I have no idea why, but my old laptop would constantly connect and disconnect and this one never does.  I was surprised at how much I like the Windows' windows (I have no idea what to call the tiles on the tablet).  They're really easy to use and make it so I can just glance at it and know if I have any emails, missed calls, FB posts, LinkedIn whatevers, etc.  I'm reminded of that commercial where the guy with the Windows phone is skydiving and quickly checks his phone for his updates.  It really is like that and I actually prefer the setup to the iPad.\n\nOverall, I've been able to run everything I need to, including Adobe PS and Premiere, as long as I save the files to my external hard drive.  I also tested it with Fallout 3, works reasonably well after twenty minutes of play, though I've hard that it can get bad towards the end of the game due to the scale of the Fallout world.  Not bad though, considering I'm playing on a $400 tablet.  Camera works well for Skype and charging really isn't an issue for me.  Office software is smooth as is YouTube video.  I actually don't even keep that much music or video on my computer anyways as I like to stream video with Amazon Prime and listen to music with Spotify.  Really isn't an issue unless I'm somewhere that doesn't have WiFi (aka poor people places).  I usually don't bring my tablet to those types of places anyways.  I'm actually quite surprised at the power of the ATOM (sp?) processor as it really seems to be better than the previous generations.\n\nYou don't really need to let it charge for 8 hours, you just have to keep it plugged in until it's fully charged the first time.  You can start it up right away as long as you keep it plugged in.  I'll post again if something goes horribly wrong with it, but so far so good.  I really couldn't be happier with this thing and it really seems like it was built to last."}

Even performance intensive applications like Photoshop and PC games like Team Fortress 2 ran smoothly. I have a netbook/tablet that could run traditional windows desktop apps, which is like a dream come true for me.

(All my other reviews on Amazon are regarding purchases I made on Amazon)\n\nI wasn't going to buy the low-end Microsoft tablets because they didn't run full Windows 8.1, as this one does, and didn't have full MS Office as this one does.  This is a great buy.  I have had none of the problems discussed in prior reviews and have had the tablet/laptop for 2 months.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I've been using mostly Mac for the last eight years, with some experiments with Linux.  I got this Transformer book for specific purposes, a super compact laptop that would do what I needed to do while traveling.  It's nice to be able to use it as a tablet for some functions, such as Kindle books, and sometimes it is easier to select an on screen item with the touch screen rather than using the trackpad.  On the other hand, I wanted an actual computer with a real physical keyboard, as I do quite a bit of writing.  This review is being written on it.\n\nAfter a month, and with one extended road trip, I'm quite pleased.  The screen is adequately sized, and very clear.  I've read criticisms of the Windows 8.1 OS, but I've found it very easy and intuitive, perhaps because it was designed with touch screen devices in mind.  I have individual criticisms of some apps, but that doesn't apply to the OS or the computer as a whole.  I've added a few programs that I wanted, but don't plan to go overboard with that.  Also put in a mini SD card for extra storage, just in case.  The version of Office that came with this is more than adequate for my needs, but I guess the installed software may not be the same from every Amazon seller, so check what you're getting.\n\nSome reviewers have noted issues with WiFi.  I can only say that there hasn't been any problem with any network I've wanted to get on.\n\nI can touch type at a reasonable speed.  Doing it on this tiny keyboard isn't as easy, and I hit the wrong key more often than I would normally, but it does get easier with practice.  That's a problem which is easily predictable in any case.\n\nThe worst issues I have in controlling it are with the trackpad.  I did read the manual to learn the \"gestures\", and I'm getting better at it.  Still, sometimes things just don't seem to work quite the way they're supposed to.  I get by, but sometimes I'm not as fast as with a more normal sized laptop.\n\nBuying this as my new travel PC has worked out very well, and the price was reasonable."}

I wasn't trying to break any speed records but the processing power seems fine for the light use I will do.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I have had this lap-let for a few weeks now, so I think I am comfortable writing a review.\n\nOverall, it is a nice unit. The tablet feels nice when holding it. The back is plastic and the build quality is certainly not as good as a surface, but the screen is nice, it is light, and you cannot beat the price. It's very nice having the micro-sd slot, but as others have said, the card sticks out a little - I have never accidentally ejected it or anything.\n\nI have no trouble with the micro usb and micro hdmi ports next to each other. I use a micro hdmi to hdmi cable and it fits nicely next to the micro hdmi cable I have connected. It would be a problem if I were using just an adapter rather than a cable, but a cable is $6, so it is nothing to complain about. I would prefer a charge and hdmi port in the kayboard also so it could work as more of a docking station.\n\nThe keyboard works nice. no backlight, but I am ok with it. It feels like a typical netbook keyboard. It is nice that it connects directly rather than via bluetooth. The touchpad on it is not great. it works, but it takes some getting used to. That and getting used to windows 8 at the same time is a challenge. The touchpad is fine for use while travelling, but if you intend to do any work with the tablet (which I do), get a bluetooth mouse. On the issue of the bluetooth mouse, I use a microsoft wedge touch mouse (by the way - awesome mouse), but I had to turn off a bluetooth option in the wifi adaptor properties on the tablet or the mouse did not work correctly. It took me awhile to figure that out.\n\nWith a full size monitor, keyboard, and bluetooth mouse, this tablet has completely replaced my desktop in my home office (and I am a software developer, so that is saying something), my previous android tablet, and my laptop. For less than $400, that is a bargain and the fact that it comes with office student installed (office without outlook, basically), you cannot beat the value. If it manages to last even just two years, it is a great deal."}

The disk drive space is fairly limited, but you can get micro-SD cards for extra storage if needed. I am not a big fan of cloud storage as I do not think it is very secure, but you can also use this or a network drive. We have a network drive and it also helps for disk space."}

And, so do I. This is such a great device that really gives you everything you could want in a convertible laptop/tablet and more. Can't recommend this enough. Only reason it's not a 5 star is due to the crappy mouse pad on the keyboard. Also, it needs more USB ports and a better front facing camera."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "First off, let me say that I have been checking out the MS Surface and the Dell Venue 11 Pro i5 prior to purchasing the Asus T100TA-C1.  The Surface is nice in the hand and has some great specifications, but was a lot higher than I wanted to pay for a tablet.  The Dell Venue 11 Pro i5 was also nice, but I could not get past the sound of the fan whirling off and on.  Both the Surface and Venue are nice models if you are looking for the higher processing power that the i5 chips would require, but the price and weight are significantly more than the Asus T100 series.\n\nI had purchased the Dell and used it for approximately a week before finally getting Dell to agree to let e return it (the Customer Service Department and the process handling purchase and returns was quite lengthy).  As far as the Surface, I had only played with ones in stores and one at work that belonged to a coworker.\n\nAdditionally, the Asus was purchased to replace my 3rd Gen iPad.\n\nOn to my review of the Asus:\nRight out of the box the Asus T100 has been fantastic.  The T100 is a perfect sized tablet, very comparable to my wife's iPad Air.  Setting up the Windows tile screen was fairly intuitive and the learning curve has been easy even though this was the first that I had used Windows 8.\n\nPhysical attributes of the Asus T100-C1:\nPROS:\n-Nice size and light weight.\n-Plastic shell, with a clear coat but does not feel cheap in the hand.\n-Touch screen is very nice and responsive. So far, all of my input gestures have been spot on.\n-Screen and display is very bright and colors look great.  Compared to my wife's iPad Air, the screen looks the same.\n  -Movie playback looks good using the Netflix App.\n-Button layout is good as the volume rocker is off to the side, the sleep/power button is on the top so as to not get bumped.\n-Micro SDXC slot!!!  I put a 64GB U1-speed micro SD-card in and have all of my iTunes library on the SD card versus the onboard memory.\n-USB 3.0!!!  I will soon load up all of my daughter's videos (which is extensive) and put them onto a small form-factor USB thumb drive for when we are travelling.\n-Keyboard is a pleasure to use, even though the size is obviously smaller than a standard laptop keyboard, I have had zero issues typing or navigating around the smaller space.  The docking of the table onto the keyboard is solid and clicks snuggly into a cupped partition on the backside of the keyboard. There is a release button at the front of the cupped dock partition that release the tablet and with a slight pull, it easily comes free (versus just falling away from the keyboard).\n\nCONS:\n-Keyboard: smaller than a standard laptop; more like a netbook.  I have had zero issues working on the smaller keyboard, but I wanted to highlight it for those that were expecting it to be comparable with your laptop-sized keyboard.\n-Plastic shell: The clear coat is a finger print magnet.  I purchased a protective skin from Amazon in order add a layer of protection from scrape and scratches anyway, so no finger print issues anymore.\n-Micro USB power connection:  The micro-USB power cord sticks straight out from the side of the tablet and looked liable to getting hit so I ordered a right-angle micro-USB to standard-USB cord from Amazon for $5.99 and now the cord barely sticks out before pointing down.\n-I wish the keyboard had an additional USB 3.0 port\n\nAsus/Windows Software:\nPROS:\n-Full Windows!!!\n-Full free version of Windows Office Home!!! I can now surf the web, watch Netflix, load iTunes, and work on actual Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents without having to use a couple of expensive purchase apps that I have on my iPad that don't always work correctly when received from my coworkers through DropBox.\n-Real Adobe\n-The Tile screen is easy to customize and use.\n-You can have 2 tasks up on the screen at the same time and adjust how much of the screen for each (music and internet, MS Word and FaceBook, whatever)\n-The swiping of tasks is great; just swipe from the left side of the screen or mouse pad, and you will scroll between tasks.\n-The tablet software is very interactive in that if you swipe from the right, a menu bar pops out from the right with options related to the task you are working on and general options; swipe from the bottom and a menu bar pops up with file options related to what you are currently doing.  Overall, very easy to be interactive with whatever you are working on.\n\nSoftware CONS:\nI haven't come across any yet, but my expectations are that of a tablet to fall somewhere between my high-end laptop and my iPad.\n\nOverall I am very pleased with my Asus purchase.  I have added the 64GB U1-speed micro SDXC card, a Bluetooth mouse, both tablet and keyboard skins (faux wood skins look surprisingly great), and the right angle micro-USB to standard-USB cord.  I have been using exclusively the Asus for about 10 days and have not used either my iPad nor my laptop during that time.  Unless something unexpected happens from here on out, a 6 year old is soon going to be inheriting an iPad 3rd Gen from her daddy.\n\nI hope this review helps in your purchasing decision.\n\nAsus/Window 8"}

I bought a 'good as new' unit from the Amazon warehouse for a slight discount.\nDisappointments:\n- the touch screen was very finicky - sometimes it recognized a touch and other times I had to resort to the equally demanding touch pad on the key board.\n- hovering over the screen was supposed to activate the display of menus or something. It never worked so I can't be more specific than that.\n- program loading seemed rather slow compared to my Android phone and desktop.\n- Windows versions of my favorite Android apps are not quite the same and had several operational problems.\n\nMaybe this 'good as new'  unit really has deeper problems than can be determined by an operational inspection. However, with this experience I'm not willing to try again. This is being returned and my search for a tablet that can sync with MS Office desktop continues."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "Update (5/16/2014):\nHave had enough issues with the T100 for it to lose another star down to 3.  There are 3 main problems:\n1) Random periodic BSOD.  They do not happen too often but started a few months ago.  About once every few weeks I get a BSOD, which is annoying, but not device ending as it is so infrequent.\n\n2) Random turnoff/slow wake up. About once every few days, I will open up the tablet and the screen will stay dark.  Sometimes after about 20-30 seconds it will wake up to the login screen (battery is practically fully charged usually when this happens, so not a low battery issue).  Sometimes it won't come up at all and I'll just have to hold the power button down for a bit to do a hard/cold boot.  Once again, not the end of the world, but a minor annoyance.\n\n3) The dock.  Still having issues where it is always disconnecting and reconnecting.  As a tablet a keyboard is not a big deal, but the problem is this is a hybrid notebook (Asus themselves classify it as a notebook).  It can sometimes take me a couple minutes of moving the screen angle around to get it to recognize the keyboard is docked so I can use it (this is without disconnecting the screen, just moving the angle of how far it is opened.  I RARELY use the T100 without the dock connected and leave it connected 99% of the time.  It is definitely secured in there).  When I am typing, the small vibrations/movements from my typing can sometimes disconnect the dock and I will hear the annoying beeping sound of connect/disconnect several times and be unable to type.  I will then have to mess with it again until it lets me type.\n\nThe 3rd problem has grown to such an annoying extent that I am updating the review and messaging Asus support.  Will update review again based on results of Asus support.\n\nOriginal Review (1/31/2014):\nI picked up the 64gb version of this Windows tablet/laptop during black Friday and have had a couple months of use to review it.  Bought it mainly for entertainment/internet/reading usage for a trip with plans to use for school as e reader.\n\nPros: Great battery life, gaming capable (long as not a top end game, seems to handle what I throw at it, but heats up a bit if play for an extended period), full version of windows and Microsoft office, screen quality is good enough for regular reading (using it for all my textbooks) and has a microsd expansion slot (on tablet) and full sized USB 3.0 port (on the dock's side).\n\nIn docked mode, do not have to worry about tablet heating up if you leave the dock sitting on cloth as you would with a regular laptop.  All the components are in the tablet/screen part.\n\nAlso the one good thing I like about the dock is it holds up the tablet well and is well balanced.  Whatever angle I set it at, it stays at and doesn't tip over or anything.  This works well when using it for reading and you do not want to hold it long.\n\nCons: Keyboard dock is sturdy and well built, but won't stay connected.  if move the 'laptop' around or touch the screen, will often lose its connection.  For many usages this is not too bad, but the full sized USB port is on the DOCK, not the laptop, so if you have any USB devices connected, it will lose it's connection as well when the dock loses its (not horrible in most cases, but potentially damaging depending on what you have connected).\n\nAlso the dock connector is not a standard usb connection of any type, which isn't essential, but does probably limit the chance at it receiving many 3rd party options for docks and long term product support.  (keyboard is a little small, though expected for tablet docking.  I wouldn't mind the option of buying a larger dock/keyboard though so I could use a full sized docked keyboard instead if I so wished)\n\nAnd last con, which hopefully changes over time, is that you cannot install other operating systems on it or really boot from USB at all.  My first experience with uefi, but seems to take extra work to get it to boot anything else at all.  When I first got it, first thing I wanted to do was to use clonezilla to make a backup image of the ssd, but I never could get clonezilla to boot.\n\nRating:  Really, at the price point and quality of the product, I would give it 5 stars if not for the Dock's connectivity issue.  I do not know if this is a manufacturer defect or product defect, but it is the only thing about this tablet that really bugs me.\n\nRecommend to others: I would definitely recommend this to others on a budget.  I think for tablets I definitely enjoy having a full windows OS on it and hard to beat at the price point.  If can afford a Surface Pro/Surface 2 Pro I would say go for that, otherwise this is a great second choice."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "the ACTUAL TITLE is WORST SUPPORT EVER\nI bought my Asus T100 64gb directly from Microsoft. I immediately had issues with the tablet's battery and charging, and I sent it in for repair. When I got my tablet back, not only was the original issue unsolved, but now the WiFi adapter malfunctioned as well. So I sent in the tablet YET AGAIN.\nAsus slowly fixed the computer. Then, they shipped it out to the WRONG ADDRESS. How they got the wrong address into their system is a mystery.\nAnyway, someone from the house in which the package had been shipped called me and told me he had received it. I then called Asus and explained the issue to them. The representative told me he created a new case and that the package would be picked up by UPS and sent back to me. He let me take the survey.\nA week later, I called in to Asus again because I still had not gotten a tracking number in an email like the first support rep said. I spoke to someone who told me that the computer had been sent to the Asus repair center again to make sure no one had tampered with it. He said it would be mailed to me shortly. Then, after asking me if I wanted to take a survey of the services I received, he hung up on me (WITHOUT letting me review his service).\nI called in again after another 5 days. The rep I spoke to told me he did not know where the computer was, and I should contact the people who originally received the package to see if they still had it. That is an extremely inappropriate response to give MORE THAN TWO WEEKS AFTER THE CASE WAS ORIGINALLY REPORTED, and after I had already been told it was being processed. This rep asked me to take the survey, then hung up on me without transferring, just like the previous person.\nI immediately called in again, as I was not satisfied with the result of the previous conversation. This time I requested to speak to a supervisor. The supervisor told me only one of my three calls had been logged. He also told me that the shipping address was still incorrect (The rep in the first call claimed to have corrected it) and that he also had no idea where the computer was. He told me he would give me updates and send me a tracking number once it became available.\nI called in again today, four days later, and spoke to another supervisor. I was told the computer's location had been identified as the house of the person who originally called me and told me they had gotten my computer. He said that the issue was now the highest priority and had been forwarded to the \"main support team.\" I was told the issue would be resolved ASAP. When I asked him how soon he reckoned the issue would be resolved, he said he had no clue. But he did say I would be shipped either the computer or a replacement computer within the next 30 days.\nIt has now been almost 37 days since I sent in my computer\n\nI called again today and was told a call tag to fed ex had been placed but there is no way to tell if or when the computer will ever be found. The least Asus can do at this point is offer a refurbished computer back to me. Every time I call their \"award-winning service\" I get a different answer. Asus,accept responsibility for your mistake and correct it!\n______I will update this review when I receive my computer or a response from Asus________\nAnyway, about the tablet - The tablet is nicely sized, snappy, but has some huge issues with the wifi adapter and the battery life."}

Windows 8 is notoriously bad and for $400 I wasn't expecting much processing power or great design.  However, the t100 blew me away.  The dock is amazing, the touch screen is great, and the ability to launch any app, including desktop apps, from the Metro interface is more useful than I could have possibly guessed.  This type of machine is what windows 8 should have focused on when it released.  I highly recommend this to any student or office worker who needs a decent travelling machine on a budget.  The included Microsoft office bundle cements my opinion.\n\nthere are some minor issues though that buyers should beware.\n-Windows 8 updates tend to break simple features on the device.\n-the track pad occasionally opens random programs if you are not used to it.\n-the volume button is known for getting stuck[though updating windows will fix it.]\n-if you don't update device drivers to be windows 8.1 compatible your machine will occasionally crash.\n\nOverall: the t100 a slightly chipped diamond among a whole lot of trash.

Unit works great as a daily replacement for both laptop and iPad. The price was also great for all that this unit includes: keyboard and Microsoft Office. The unit would have gotten 4 stars, but problems with the non-removable battery concerns me of its longevity. The unit will not power up while on the AC adapter, unless there is some charge on the battery. To make matters worse with a fully charged battery, the unit is unable to stay on standby for a day without fully depleting the battery. This resulted in many situations where I could not use the computer for several hours, which defeats the main purpose of a iPad replacement. I don't have the same problem with the iPad, which I can pickup and use several days later without constantly worrying about the battery. Check the battery using the Windows 8 battery diagnostics log, and found that the battery capacity has decreased from 31,000 mWh to 22,000 mWh. At this rate of battery deterioration, this unit may not work after 2 years of ownership. Other than the battery issue and low available usable drive space, this unit is great.

I have a desktop for my multi-tasker and this for portable ease. I write a lot but I didn't want an android (or kr-apple) tablet. I also didn't want to spend a lot. Samsung and Asus are musts for any platform device. Here Asus has given a fully-functuonal Windows 8 hybrid tablet (only other one is Microsoft surface pro which costs and arm and a leg and you have to buy the keyboard too). I was ecstatic about a SsD! Oh and Microsoft Office Student comes already in the price. I have had the device for three weeks and am pleased with the $400 spent. Buy the bigger memory, it is worth it, as you won't have anything left after Office is installed (I'm sitting at an extra 16gbs).\n\nAgain to warn everyone, this machine is awesome but it is not as desktop or a typical android tablet.

When I first received the product, I immediately hooked it up to a charger, and waited til it charged completely. Windows 8.1, though mostly disliked on desktops, is nice to have for a tablet, with faster boot times and easier search. Windows Store is very lacking, and I suggest OblyTile to make Desktop apps appear on the Start Screen. Now, onto the specifics.\nThe battery life on this is EXCELLENT, and lasts me at least 1 full day of heavy use, and can make it a second day with light use. Even with full brightness and constant internet browsing, it is a juggernaut, and always survives til night.\nThe screen, though only 1366x768, looks crisp, and works well. It is VERY fingerprint prone, so I highly suggest a screen protector.\nThe keyboard is absolutely amazing, and the size is not an issue at all for me. The detachability makes this the perfect hybrid, and it doesn't feel like just a tablet with a flimsy dock, but more like a small laptop. The touchpad is iffy, but gets the job done when you really need it over touchscreen (some scrolling in browser, highlighting).\nCONS:\nThis is no perfect machine. I have had more than a few minor issues with it.\nThe tablet has gotten stuck in boot loops, had volume key issues, headphone port issues, audio driver issues, Wi-Fi issues, HDMI port issues, microUSB port issues, Blue Screen of Death issues, among others.\nMost can be fixed by a simple reboot, but some (the Wi-Fi and microUSB specifically) required me to install a newer version of the BIOS. This machine now works perfectly, with only some minor things occurring that are fixed with a restart.\nI have disabled Windows 8 updates, as they are time-consuming, usually end up causing boot looping, and are way too frequent. Definitely suggest any users do the same.\n\nOverall, this is a great tablet, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a full Windows 8 experience in a small, portable form factor. This product, or at least the one I received, is definitely NOT for those who want absolutely no issues with their machine. It took some loving, swearing, and tinkering, but I have no regrets buying this machine. All my friends love using this, and it is DEFINITELY better than a Surface 2 (I have tried both, and it's no comparison)."}

I never have to worry about looking for a power outlet when I am at a caf or Airport.\n2. The hardware on this thing is just spectacular. Its just fast!\n3. Awesome browsing experience. If you like the good old Web, you would love this device.\n\nWhat I don't Like about the device:\n\n0. Its Running Windows! And lets face it...Windows is just not as polished and good as other mobile OS (IOS/Android) and also Desktop OS (OSX). When I am in the Desktop mode its just a clunky device. In Tablet mode its pretty good but the windows store hardly has any good apps. Most metro style apps have limitations. So I ended up installing the same app on Desktop mode (To get all the features) and also from the Windows Store (To get the touch UI).\n\n1. The Trackpad is not as good as other Asus products.\n2. The keyboard could be better. but its useable.\n3. Windows Store hardly has any \"Good\" apps.\n\nWho is this device for?\n\nIf you are familiar with Windows and want a computer that may fit the smallest bag you have then this device is for you. Its light weight, Its very portable and has long battery life.\n\nIf you are tired of viewing \"Mobile sites\" via your ipad/Android tablet then this is definitely a device for you. The latest IE is absolutely gorgeous and pages load amazingly fast and you can have FULL web experience (Even when ur in the tablet mode).\n\nThe Mail app that comes with Windows is great too and supports all Exchange, Gmail, Google Apps, Yahoo and you name it.\n\nWho is this device not for?\n\nIf you think this can replace your laptop (MacBook Air), then you are wrong. The Tiny keyboard, bad trackpad is definitely bad enough for you to not use it  for too long in one go (Unless you plan on getting RSI).\n\nStudents, I don't think you want to type your assignments with this keyboard.  You should get a MacBook Air or equivalent.\n\nConsider this as your secondary Computer, that is slightly better than your tablet (for browsing experience, Email and so on) but inferior compared to the real ultrabooks (e.g. Mac Air).\n\nBefore you buy this, compare your use case and see if a $199 Acer Chromebook suits you more."}

I need something more powerful than an Android Tablet or an iPad to complete homework assignments for college.  This comes with Microsoft Office and Windows 8.  The only problem I have is that the keyboard easily disconnects from the tablet and I have to push it in harder to reconnect it.  It seems to be a flaw in a very very very few of these.\n\nEDIT - Solution to dock problem\n\nFound a solution to the Keyboard dock not holding the tablet without disconnecting.  It actually involved a flat head screw driver and a hammer (It worked, but be careful).  On the tablet, where the dock hook attaches, I took a screw driver and hammer and lightly tapped the metal 'boxes' in this area.  It seemed to push them in a little bit and now it holds tighter on the keyboard."}

I have an iPad 3 and love the ease of use of a tablet. This unit is a computer, it functions like a laptop weather is used as a tablet or connected to the keyboard. It runs Windows 8, another whole rant, so it functions just like sitting in front of a PC. That is NOT what I want from a tablet."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I purchased this computer as an alternative to having a tablet and a laptop, and it mostly lives up to my expectations.\n\nIt is very light and the battery runs a long time - specs say 11 hrs, and I do get somewhere close to that. It is quite fast, and I like the fact that it runs full Windows applications. The added bonus is that it came with MS Office pre-installed - can't beat the value. Of course, this is not a Surface Pro 2 - it only has an (quad core) Atom processor and 2GB RAM, so I wouldn't try runing heavy-duty applications. Still it seems plenty responsive for web browsing, document editing, and other typical uses of the 90% of people. The screen is very responsive and smooth, and I haven't hit peformance bottlenecks with my types of usage. The SSD is only 64GB, but I am thinking of adding a large capacity SD card, should the space become an issue.\n\nIt helps that the computer comes with a keyboard - it is way better to type on that than on the screen keyboard. The trackpad also works well, better than many of the full-size laptops of the past years. The speakers are pretty loud, and I could listen to an audiobook in the car with just the laptop speakers, while driving. I haven't figured out how to connect it using BlueTooth (though there is also an audio cable option that works).\n\nSome Cons:\n-the screen is only 10.1\", which is kind of small. When my eyesight was sharper, I had been able to use small screens, but now I wish I had a larger-screen option. There is a microHDMI connector, and I was able to connect it to a large-screen TV for some karaoke and YouTube videos. I am sure I can attach it to a larger monitor, but can't carry one with me.\n-the charging is via micro-USB, and while the adapters are easy to find even if you forget your own, it takes a long time to fully recharge the battery, even with the charger which was shipped with the unit, (and not with a cellphone charger).\n-the full-size USB port is only on the keyboard base - I wish there was one on the tablet part, but this is not a major thing\n-the keyboard is small, smaller than the regular one, and takes a lot of adjustment. Without using it fulltime, I can't touchtype, tough when I stay with it for a while, I get better. Some keys had to be made smaller, like right Shift, and Enter. This is not the end of the world, but should be noted.\n-the keyboard dock requires moving a latch to disengage the tablet, but occasionally the connection appears loose, and it makes a \"da-ding\" sound to indicate that the keyboard is disconnected. It is usually followed by a \"di-dang\" sound almost immediately, to show that the connection is made again. Sometimes, I need to give the tabled a slight push towards the hinge to reconnect. This is a little annoying, but only happens when I keep it on my lap, and very infrequently at that.\n-the tablet is a fingerprint magnet, both the screen and the shiny back. The matte-finish keyboard is OK\n\nNot specifically related to this device, some notes on software:\nFor web browsing, the IE works better than Chrome (never thought I'd say that). The IE is designed for tablet browsing, and is easy to resize with pinching the screen. The Chrome not so much, even though I had enabled touchscreen extensions. The touch is very responsive, and I have gotten so used to it that I find myself reaching for the screen even on my other computers. Still, if you have to right-click, you should use the touchpad button (or an external mouse), as touching a button will typically do a left-click. Many apps are not designed for touch, and have very small (too fine for my thick fingers) touch zones. So having a keyboard with the touchpad is a plus, again.\n\nThe computer has an orientation sensor, which works well, perhaps too well - even with the keyboard attached, turning it switches the orientation - I wish it was easier to disable, especially when docked.\n\nAll in all, this is a very good computer. While it may not have as many games, it is more useful than my Android tablet (also Asus). it is a little heavier, but if you travel and only need to take one device with you, I would definitely recommend it.\n\nThe cramped keyboard and screen make it not quite suitable as a laptop replacement, but then at this price, this computer is not intended as one."}

It comes with windows 8.1 yes, however it is a 32-bit version even thought the OS says it is running on a 64-bit capable processor, Some things can run on the micro usb SD card, but not everything.  I would recommend you put things like big files or movies on it. It is still running a Windows operating system, so just like any other PC, you need to reboot this thing from time to time in order for it to operate better.  It is a tablet form factor, but it is not an App machine like you would find with an Apple Ipad or Android Tablet.  It runs Windows apps, and you know how many there are of those, however as a PC, it works very well.  I am very pleased with this purchase as sometimes I want to just use a PC in a tablet format and this thing delivers that experience for me. I found that once you start getting use to the touchscreen, you find less reason to keep the keyboard attached.  I am using the keyboard very sparingly now.  Sound on this tablet is a beast!  It is louder than my laptop and sound very good. If you know what your want this thing for and it is within the guidelines I just described, I would say go for it."}

Then how does Asus account for all the other Amazon reviewers on one of two T100 product pages, as of this date, noting malfunctioning Asus T100 computers?\n\nHere's Asus's self-serving version of reality, which it evidently would like to impose on actual reality:\n\n\"Initial post: Jan 21, 2014 9:37:51 AM PST\nASUS Support says:\n(MANUFACTURER)\nDear Valued Customer,\n\nThank you for choosing an ASUS product. All ASUS products undergo intensive quality control testing and inspection, this is an isolated case. I do understand your concern regarding the Corsair Flash drive not being recognized and the short battery life. It is recommended to charge the battery fully before usage. Please verify if the unit is running with the most current BIOS version 223. If you need further assistance, please email me at cl-rodel@asus.com and write down service# 3362010 on the subject line.\n\nRegards,\n\nRodel\nASUS Customer Loyalty\"\n\nThis CYA description, alleging \"an isolated case,\" from Asus through Mr. or Ms. Rodel at Asus Customer Loyalty (apparently a club for the lucky Asus buyers with functioning machines as opposed to the unlucky rest of us \"Valued Customers\"), ignores the numerous negative reviews detailing substantial problems with this computer, as published on an Amazon listing for one of the T100 models.\n\nI'm being told I'm the only one w/ a problem. Hello? The stats say otherwise. It's Asus that has the problem, and the official Asus response is offensive.\n\nAsus takes no meaningful responsibility and offers no brand-new replacement for its brand-new malfunctioning computer, which is simply one of many malfunctioning T100s Amazon reviewers have described.\n\nI didn't respond to the Asus email. I'd already wasted enough time with Asus tech support trying to address failures of my brand-new T100.\n\nA few days later the second of my two new Asus T100s malfunctioned - no doubt another Asus-described \"isolated\" case.\n\nSo I had two out of two malfunctioning Asus T100s. And a significant number of Amazon reviewers are reporting malfunctioning T100s.\n\nHow many \"isolated\" cases does it take for Asus to register it has a problem?\n\nAnd, since it's responding to Amazon negative reviews like mine, Asus is evidently aware that it has a problem. But is it dealing with the problem in a responsible way?\n\nSo not happening.\n\nFor me, this underscores the necessity for a Computer Buyer's Bill of Rights, as I proposed yesterday, in the update below.\n\nI'd like to add to the Computer Buyer's Bill of Rights that any and all replacement shipping as discussed below would be the computer company's responsibility, as would picking up the defective computer. Think UPS pickup, for example. Buyers with defective brand-new computers shouldn't have to carry to a mailing facility the faulty products that are the computer companies' responsibility.\n\nIf you buy a brand-new computer, you're not signing up to be a pickup and delivery person for the computer company. You're signing up to receive what you paid for: a brand-new functioning computer.\n\nJan. 23, 2014 update for my review of Jan. 16, 2014:\n\nI noted then (see below) that of the two T100s I'd bought, one was malfunctioning. A few days later, the second one did the same. When two out of two new Asus computers malfunction (and I'm not the only reviewer to have this experience), then it would seem that Asus has quality-control problems. That would be a far more important issue for prospective buyers than any individual reviewer's negative report.\n\nConsider the five- and four-star reviews (as I write this, they total 485) and then note, please, the fewer but still numerous one-star reviews like mine, at present totaling 81; if you add the 44 two-star reviews, the total of unhappy campers is 125, or, at present, more than 25% of buyers. The one- and two-star reviews, for the most part, aren't discussing the relative merits of this tablet/notebook computer; no, they're reporting that basically it doesn't work.\n\nMaybe the attractive pricing for this model is subsidized by Asus's possibly skimping on quality control. That would leave the people with malfunctioning T100s bearing the cost and time of Asus's possible skimping. And there's certainly some verifiable skimping: I was stunned by Asus's offer to repair my first malfunctioning new computer; I rejected the offer because I'd bought a new computer, not a fixer-upper. I wanted a replacement new computer that worked out of the box and was reliable -- what I paid for. Asus wouldn't go for that.\n\nMaybe if this model had been priced slightly higher, then Asus would've paid for necessary quality control and a higher percentage of computers sold would be reliable. Instead, it seems to me, the 25% of buyers with glitchy new T100s are paying for the 75% of buyers who are happy campers. I'm glad for the buyers with good experiences; I'm simply saying I shouldn't be paying for them in order to enable Asus to maintain a low price point. Getting a reliable new computer shouldn't be a matter of luck; it should be part of the contract between the manufacturer and the end purchaser.\n\nIt's time for a computer buyer's Bill of Rights so that companies like Asus can't palm off a bad manufacturing run of computers on unsuspecting buyers and then offer repairs instead of replacement brand-new functioning computers.\n\nI'd like to see Amazon, which has terrific customer service, and the computer companies that sell on the site enter into discussions about the companies' responsibility to buyers. Amazon is better positioned than the individual states' attorneys general and consumer bureaus to effect real change in the current setup, which overwhelmingly favors the computer companies.\n\nGiven the complexity of computers and the defects that over time reveal themselves - as opposed to a simple DOA computer - I'm suggesting a period of a month for the buyer to receive a refund and a period of ninety (90) days for the buyer to receive a replacement new machine. Forget this outrageous system of companies' repairing a new but defective computer instead of replacing it with a new one that works out of the box - which is what the buyer paid for, after all.\n\nWill there be abuse by buyers under such a Bill of Rights? No doubt, but it surely will be less rampant than the present system that provides computer companies with no incentive to have quality control.\n\nLet's try to get some balance here so that individuals, the end buyers, don't have time and money wasted by computer companies' failure to have meaningful quality control.\n\nAfter all, getting what you paid for in a computer shouldn't be a matter of luck.\n\nJanuary 16, 2014 review:\n\nAsk yourself: Do you feel lucky?\n\nBought two T100s from Amazon the end of October. One works, the other doesn't. Have spent a lot of time with Asus Tech Support.\n\nThe lemon T100 is still a lemon. Doesn't recognize a Corsair flash drive that its twin Asus and a third computer of mine both recognize. Doesn't hold a charge. Ten-hour battery life? Try an hour instead.\n\nAsus wants me to send it in to be fixed.\n\nFixed?\n\nI want Asus to pick up its defective product and send me the new, working computer I paid for and never received.\n\nAsus wants to patch over its quality-control problems by \"fixing\" the defective computer it sold. Asus's business model is that for my two-computer purchase I should have one new computer and one patched-up piece of garbage.\n\nSo if you're reading reviews to see if you should buy this -- or any other -- Asus computer, ask yourself: Can you beat the Asus odds? Are you going to be the exception to their predatory business model? Do you see any law protecting you from them? Do you feel lucky? Do ya?"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "This device is great, it does everything I expect it to do. I'm a college student, and purchased this device mainly for notes taking in class. I did NOT purchase it to replace a proper laptop/desktop, and did not expect any high performance out of this device. Yes it will run autocad, inventor, photoshop, but you are way better off with a proper computer(unless your computer is ancient).\n\nFrom my 2 weeks of using this device, I found that the main bottleneck of this tablet's performance is still the CPU. Yes the new atom Z3740 increased performance dramatically compared to the last version, but it is by no means FAST. I found it constantly turbo boosting to 1.8Ghz, and running at ~30-40% usage when playing a simple youtube video.\nI was amazed at the optimization of windows 8, initially I was very worried that the 2GB of RAM will simply not cut it, as I have 16GB in my desktop and 8GB in my laptop, and I'm constantly using up 4-5GB of the RAM when not doing much. But windows 8.1 amazed me, the RAM usage stayed at 0.9GB while idling, and I have never seen it above 1.7GB other than when I was installing new software or opening multiple applications. And even then the tablet does not feel \"laggy\", if there are any, it's from the CPU, which you will be finding is running at 100% usage. The RAM optimization is definitely better than windows 7, and miles ahead of XP and vista if anyone still uses those legacy OS...\nThe internal storage is small, but I have about 32GB ish left after I installed my software that I will be using on this machine, which is not much. It is not fast, it is not a SSD, it's the same storage device found inside your typical tablet and smartphone. The read speed is fairly normal compared to a 7200rpm HDD, the write speed is extremely low. But you probably won't be installing stuff all day on this tablet so I don't think that will be too big of an issue.  Looks like I will not be putting in a microSD, as the space left is more than enough to store my pdf, ppt, excel, and word documents, but you do have the choice of adding another 64GB.\nI got about 5 days on a single charge of mainly standby, with occasional screen on time, at the end of the 5th day, i was at 27% charge. When I tried to use it for real, I got nearly 16 hours of battery life for word processing, this was way better than what I hoped. For mixed usage, Asus's estimate is about right, I got about 10-11 hours, and for watching video file with an external HDD connected, I got about 6 hours. This definitely gets the same if not more battery life than my Asus Tf300 which runs android 4.2.1., and yet this one runs a full blown x86 system. Intel's new atom bay-trail CPU might not be a performer, but the power draw is just amazingly low.\nNever tried to play games on it, and is not planning to do so, as this is not supposed to be used as a computer replacement anyway, just a way more useful tablet/notebook than ipad or android tablets at a fraction of the cost. I paid $379+tax for my device, and I think the current amazon price by sellers are just too high.\n\nHaven't seen any quality issues with my unit, some earlier batches may have issues. But if yours is manufactured in the later half of Dec 2013, you should be good.\nI can see how keyboard could be an issue for people who have large hands, or fingers rather, my hand size is considered average in males, and I do not find it very hard to get used to typing on it. In fact I typed this review on this device.\nMy main complaints about this device is the very small right shift key..I keep hitting the up arrow when I want to hit the right shift key, for quotation marks, question marks etc.. they could've made the arrow key more compact and made the shift bigger.\nAlso the keyboard and touchpad makes a lot of noise compared to my laptop. The touchpad mouse keys are especially bad, I try to avoid using the keys unless I have to right click something...but you can always use your fingers. Won't reduce a star because of it, simply because of the price point, if this was a more premium device, it would be a different story. There is also no backlit for the keyboard, but I don't look at the keyboard when I'm typing anyway, plus at sub$400 what can you expect?\n\nIf you are an elderly person, or one with very bad eyesights, the fonts/icons/menus WILL BE SMALL. The DPI is pretty high on this tablet. So be aware of that before you purchase. It's not an issue if you use metro apps, but will be an issue if you want to work in desktop mode. I found the size to be fine for me, as I like smaller fonts/icons anyway to allow me to see more, when I showed it to my mother however, she claimed that it's \"tiny\" and it make her eyes hurt. The font sizes can be adjusted in the settings in windows 8 based on your preference, but even then she still says it's small for viewing in desktop mode."}

With the new Transformer it allows me the freedom to sit in front of the television or anywhere else and get up to speed on emails, facebook and any of the latest information I need without the baby interfering.  Don't think she realizes I'm on a computer when I just use the tablet.  Learning the new windows has been a challenge but that is just due to not taking the time to dig in and figure it out but I'm sure it will come.  My wife loves her transformer also and agrees with my rating.  Thanks"}

The people at LR go the extra mile to make sure you are satisfied. This tablet would be a 3-4 star tablet if not for Paul and the software fix. So thank you thank you LR Industries and if you have a chance to buy from them, do it, because the price is fair and they make sure you get the product you deserve.\n\nNow, as for the Tablet itself, great machine. Its large enough to type fairly comfortably, its just a little small so if you got big hands you may be getting most comfortable with the plenty large backspace button rather than the too small shift key. Its small enough I can easily take it anywhere, and it looks very professional especially in the not-leather cases you can buy that come with extra pockets. I use mine for Paper and I carry a pen on the case (kinda nice) to make the original ipad when the situation calls for a sticky note. The hardware is good for being so affordable, its plastic not metal but just don't drop it from very high. The processor is strong enough to carry out multiple tasks at one time and make downloading not too long. It's got all the advantages of Windows 8.1 including legacy programs like excel and word. Really just a solid product. combined with great service from the company that sold me the tablet and fixed my software in my time of need (farmer's tax season) and got me that excel program I paid for. Just really grateful, thanks again Paul. everyone else just gave me the run around yada yada... but they fixed me up good. Ok, so good product good service 5 star experience and a workable and fun tablet. cool"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I'm relatively new to tablets, having owned PCs and Macs for the past two decades.  Coming from a Galaxy Tab 2 7.0, I needed something portable for that could handle email and a few other light tasks.  In Europe, I used my tablet to send emails, view photos, and store things like travel brochures that I found online and saved to Pocket via the internet.  However, I quickly found the tablet's limitations much too constricting -- I couldn't save pdf ebooks and send them to my Kindle via email, for example.  Nor could I do even simple photo processing for posting on the internet.  I did some research on the Ipad, because pretty much everyone told me it was \"better,\" but the Ipad is much more proprietary and doesn't come with any usb ports!  Enter a Windows tablet -- a laptop and a tablet where I can store my files, edit all my photos, install and use Itunes, Amazon video player, Netflix, Mobi converters, PDF files, etc. etc. in a super portable device!\n\nIpads and tablets are great for people who aren't really comfortable with computers, just click an icon and up comes some abbreviated information.  This device, however is more geared towards a user who demands more \"computing\" capabilities, like word processing, etc.  I could imagine someone who just wants to check email, the weather or headlines  (like my Mom who owns and Ipad and loves it) could get overwhelmed by it.\n\nI've only had this three days and I followed all the tips I gleaned from these reviews.  I charged it the full 8 hours before turning it on.  I disabled Windows Update and installed the ASUS updates via the ASUS Live Update Program.  Then I checked \"manually choose Windows Updates\" and updated, excluding the two updates KBB2883200 & KBB2887595.  I registered Office.  I installed the program Classic Shell which helped me find all these damn things, since I don't know how to navigate Windows 8 yet. I calibrated my mouse (disable three finger gesture and edge gestures), calibrated the display and fonts, uninstalled reading mode.  The only problem I have found so far is that it seems to charge slowly, like really slowly.  In fact, the battery seems to discharge even when the screen is on full brightness.  So I changed it to one level below full brightness, and this seemed to help.\n\nThis computer has been awesome so far and I can't wait to try Virtualbox so I can install all my favorite Android apps, too."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "This unit is very satisfying.  I am a new user of the Windows 8 (8.1) O.S. and I had my reservations after so many happy years of using Windows XP, and more recently, Windows 7.  I am 68 years old and I, also, have never owned a smart phone or other touch screen device so the adaptation to the use of gestures instead of mouse and keyboard clicks is an ongoing process.  Time will tell whether I can fully adapt to mouseless computing (I admit to having purchased a blue-tooth mouse).  My one complaint is the (short) length of the USB connector which comes with the wall charger.  I have purchased a separate adapter, which comes with a permanent and longer cable, for use while at home.  I have also purchased a longer USB cable with the appropriate connectors for use with the charger provided with the unit.  I will carry those items with me in when traveling.  The unit, after an initial 24 hours charging, cycled on and permitted setup with no problems.  It functions flawlessly and appears to have good battery life under usual demands such as e-book reading, e-mail retrieval and web browsing.  I can highly recommend this device."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I'm a fairly demanding and longtime user of mobile computers.  I love the transformer concept of a sizeable lightweight pad with detachable keyboard.  Best of both worlds.  The Asus blend of size, weight and computing power, combined with superb design & engineering make this device a joy to use.  I seriously wish the RAM could be expanded beyond the puny 2GBs of hardwired memory.  Otherwise it's a great trade-off of size, weight, and function at today's level of affordable technology.  Battery life is fantastic if configured & used prudently.  Win 8 is another story.  I'd have much prefered the much leaner & meaner Win 7, but I guess this is the price we have to pay for a touchscreen capable machine.\n\nI would recommend this unit to all travellers except those needing the more heavy-duty graphics or number-crunching software on the road.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I ordered this as a replacement for a netbook I broke that I used mostly for surfing the net and for writing.  The fact that it came with a free copy of Microsoft Word was a factor in my deciding to buy it.  Frankly, if I could have got away with using an Android tablet, I would have since I am used to the OS, but the problem is, all the replacement Word programs for Android that I tried kept messing up the formatting of my already-existing documents.  So a Windows product was the only way to go.\nI chose this one over the Microsoft Surface because of the price.  I paid for this 2-in-1 with provided keyboard what I would have had to pay for the Surface by itself and then I would have had to buy the Type keyboard on top of that.\nI read a few horror stories about problems with Windows update on this product, so I turned it off immediately upon powering up the computer.  I've had it a week now and have had no problems.\nSo far, the Asus Transformer has worked perfectly for me, and I've found it to be a bit more versatile for my needs than an Android tablet.  It's nice and fast compared to the old netbook I was using, the keyboard is laid out well for my needs and I've found I like the combination of touch screen and keyboard.  Windows 8, about which I'd heard many complaints, isn't too difficult to get used to.  I would like a larger hard drive, but that's one of the things you sacrifice when you buy a 2-in-1.  I also would like to have another USB port, but again I knew what I was getting.\nAll things considered, I have no real complaints about this product and I would recommend it for anyone that needs a tablet with an attachable keyboard.\n\nJust an edit six months later to say that the Asus is still working fine.  About the only complaint I have is that the power button is a bit small and hard to push in far enough to power on the tablet.  Good product for the money."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "My first W8 tablet and I love it. I've had almost every iPad and contemplated getting an Android tablet because I needed something more powerful. I wanted something that I could use full office and work with while also having the functionality of a tablet. I also wanted something to play games when I wanted to and I'm a casual PC gamer. Windows RT is good if you really only want tablet functionality but it does lack a lot of apps, I wanted full windows but didn't want to compromise on battery life & weight and spend a lot of money. The Windows Store still has a long way to go with apps but I really love the interface/UI of Windows 8. It's much more intuitive with the live tiles and the flow of the Home screen compared to any Android or iOS tablet. Having full windows 8 functionality when you need it is great. The T100 comes with a full version of Office Home (Word, PowerPoint, Excel). It really is a workhorse when you need it to be, battery life is amazing, and it's a great size/weight. I love having the windows button on the side, prevents accidental home screen presses. You'll definitely have to get used to the keyboard but it feels solid and its awesome to have a full sized keyboard when you need to plus it makes having it on your lap a little easier than a regular tablet since it's very sturdy. I put a Brushed Metal Skinomi Tech Skin and screen protector on it and it really makes it look and feel like a high end device. Plus without it the glossy back attracts fingerprints too easily. I play Torchlight II, Natural Selection 2, Battlefield Bad Company II, DOTA, Deus Ex. Most run pretty well, sometimes you get memory notifications but it still powers through very well. The new intel processors are awesome. It'll last me a couple of years and by that time I'm sure they'll have even more powerful W8 devices. If you're a student or business professional this is perfect for you. If you need something with a bigger/smaller screen and/or more RAM & GPU/CPU power, then you may want to look at the new Sony W8 tab or Surface Pro II."}

Being that it's a touchscreen device I haven't spent much time using the trackpad however, so it can be considered negligible. The keyboard was surprisingly easy to type on as well, my hands didn't feel crowded & the keys were responsive. It also takes a long time to charge, i usually leave it overnight so I can't give an exact time frame, however, when it does charge the battery life is excellent.

It is not, although if I had never owned an i-pad It would be very impressive.  That being said, it is a super miniature windows 8.1 computer. Set up was a snap, It instantly found my wireless internet and was ready to use in about five minutes, but you do need to plug it in and charge it for 8 hours first.  I found the touch screen and keyboard very responsive and it comes with a wide variety of windows type applications and is compatible with Office 2013.  It is a speedy machine, no delay between selecting the app and having it open right up.  I have rather large hands and fingers but did not find that a problem...but I would not want to type a 20 page thesis on it.  It's my first experience with windows 8.1 and for the most part, I don't see what all the negativity about that is all about.  While it allows two windows open side by side, it's sort of difficult on such a small screen.  The removable screen is a nice feature.  But, when it is connected it does not fold out all the way flat, and there were times when I wished the screen would tilt back just a bit further than it does.  During my usage I found the battery lasted about 8 hours.  Another nice feature is the ability to completely erase the machine back to its original \"out of the box\" settings with just two clicks.  Overall, if you are looking for a miniature windows 8 computer you will probably love this little package.  And, if you don't, Amazon will take it back within 30 days (assuming you haven't scratched or banged it up)  and give you a no hassle refund, minus return shipping....Kudos to Amazon for that !"}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I bought the T100TA because of price point, other positive reviews, the detachable keyboard, and the fact that it is Windows-based. (I have never used Apple products). The first machine I bought had to be returned because the on/off button was positioned below the case and did not work properly. The second machine I had about 3 weeks, learning how to use it and adding apps. I liked the keyboard, although my fingers would often find keys they should not be using and then we'd have to go back and edit. However, there were a number of system updates that came through and seemed to screw things up - the tablet would get hung up and after calling the help desk, learned the \"trick\" of holding the power button down for 20 seconds, plug in the AC and then restart. That worked a number of times. However, the last time I had been using the web, and walked away for a time. Upon my return, I noticed the machine was off, although I did not turn it off. I thought it was doing an upgrade however, when I turned it back on, the screen kept blinking on and off. I turned it off again, then turned it back on. The start screen came up, but when I launched an app, all I got was the blue screen of death. All the apps were not working. I called the Asus tech support, who told me \"this was an unusual problem\" and we needed to refresh the machine, which meant going back to the factory model and loosing all apps I downloaded. So we try that, however, it asked for a \"recovery key\" which Tech Support said it should not be asking and they could not help me. The screen was dead to the touch, the keyboard was dead. I could access the web only. They suggested I return it to the store (Best Buy) and they would repair it for me. At this point, less than 30 days old, I said no way. This was a POS, the second machine I had, and I expected it to work - not have to be repaired less than 30 days old. The Geek Squad got the same results when I returned it. So it's back to shopping for a tablet - I bought the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 edition. Let's hope I have better luck. The Asus problem may have been rare, but it certainly soured my experience. Buyer beware!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I rarely ever leave reviews on products I purchase, but I felt compelled to write one for the Asus T100 because of how versatile, powerful, and fantastic this machine is at such a bargain price.  If it's any indication at all, Amazon has been sold out of this product several times already (still is currently) and was the number 1 top selling laptop on Amazon last I checked a few weeks back around Thanksgiving.  To provide a little background about how I use this machine, I am a college student who uses the T100 for note taking, entertainment, and general browsing.\n\nAs a college student, I was looking for a computer that was light and would last all day so I could take it with me on the go that won't die in the middle of class.  I was looking at the Asus T100, several Windows ultrabooks, and the Macbook air.  However, when I thought about what I would be using this computer for, I couldn't justify spending $700-800 more on an ultrabook or Macbook when the T100 could easily last me all day through class for a mere $350.  Furthermore, I have a gaming desktop I use for anything power-intensive.  Compared to my old laptop which would die in the middle of class lasting only 1 hour, this laptop lasts an incredibly long time and can easily hit the report number of hours.\n\nI also needed a machine that could help me with productivity, and the Asus T100 definitely met that criteria as well.  As many have noted already, this machine comes with Microsoft office pre-installed (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote), which is a fantastic value considering that it would cost an additional $100 or so to buy it separately, and the Mac OS version of this software is still not up to par.  Furthermore, I also considered how useful a touchscreen would be for productivity, and so far from using it I can say that having a touchscreen has been extremely useful.  Enlarging pages with pinch-zoom is a breeze, scrolling is quick and accurate, and switching between multiple windows is quick.\n\nFor the general user or student, this computer would easily fit their needs.  Don't be afraid of the atom processor or 2 gb of ram.  Atom processors have a bad name to them for being known for low-powered netbooks, but this new BayTrail atom is the perfect blend of energy efficiency, power, and speed.  I rarely ever run into any hiccups when I use the T100, and for what I use the computer for 2 gb or ram is sufficient even for full Windows 8.  In my opinion, the T100 is the nail in the coffin for Windows RT because the Surface 2 is more expensive, doesn't include a keyboard, and runs a dumbed-down version of Windows.  I expect to see many more of these sorts of tablet-laptop hybrids in the future because that is where Windows 8 really shines.  Asus has proven that you can indeed get the best of both worlds using the right hardware to support a machine that works well as a tablet and laptop, has the battery power of mobile devices, and can be used for both productivity and entertainment.\n\nThat being said, the Asus T100 may not be for everyone.  For those looking for premium devices that look and feel high quality, you may wish to look elsewhere.  That's not to say this computer is extremely cheap looking, but I can definitely feel some rough edges on the tablet, can see numerous fingerprints on the back, and can hear the cheap touchpad every time I click it.  For those looking to do intensive gaming, extensive video editing, and other power-hungry tasks, I am not so sure that the processor and ram can handle those sorts of tasks efficiently.  I know for a fact that older games such as portal and Team Fortress 2 can run smoothly (there are many performance tests videos on YouTube).  LIke others have said, the keyboard is indeed smaller than a full-sized one, but I have small hands and can type very easily on it.  Because of the screen size, using the touch screen to select certain icons on desktop menus can be difficult at times, and I often have to resort to using the touchpad for more pinpoint accuracy.  If you are looking for a tablet first and laptop second, I personally think other Android/iOS options make superior tablets.  The 16:9 ratio of this tablet can be odd in portrait mode, and the Windows store as of now pales in comparison to Android/iOS.\n\nOverall, this product can't be beat for how much you get of it for how little you pay.  I am absolutely satisfied with this purchase and look forward to perhaps a more premium version of the Asus T100 with better materials and QC in the future.  The reason that this product has so many 1-star ratings is because the Asus T100 did have its glitches when it first came out.  To ensure that your computer operates as it should, definitely charge the computer for the 8 hours before turning on, update to bios 220 asap, do manual windows updates, and download the latest drivers on Asus's website.  Also, transformer forums is a great place to look up any other issues you may encounter.  I don't fault Asus for these issues because of how new this technology is and the lower price point.  Hopefully  Asus will have learned from this experience and will release more refined products in the future.  After getting everything setup, however, I have been extremely pleased with this computer and have used it for everything from notes to Netflix."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "My Tablet came with the latest version of MS 8.1 OS and bios which I was grateful for. I had a mental block when looking for apps and was extremely limited (and frustrated) by the limited MS app store until days later it dawned on me that IT'S A WINDOWS MACHINE AND I CAN GET ALL MY APPS DIRECTLY FROM THE NET! So screw the MS app store. My old Android store limitations are gone.\n\nLove the versatility of being able to detach the tablet or use a keyboard and mouse if I want. I added a 64mb MicroSd card to hold a few movies and other programs and it's plenty. Speed is plenty fast for being a portable unit.\n\nThe only ding would be for the lack of a 2nd/3rd usb port for peripherals. Love the 3.0 usb speed and HDMI port so if that's the trade I can't complain and will simply get a tiny usb hub for the occasional use. I'll report back if I have any issues but as it stands it far exceeds my expectations for a sub $400 versatile 8.1 tablet. No regrets."}

The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is the plastic case - otherwise a great unit."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "After having this device for two weeks, I can say that this device is precisely what I needed.  I have a powerful desktop for gaming.  What I need out of a laptop is portability, flexability, and battery life, and this device does not disappoint.  For less than the price of a Surface 2, you get a full Windows 8.1 OS, not the stripped down Windows RT, on a device that is just a powerful, as well a well made physical keyboard with traditional laptop keys.  It gets every bit of the advertised 11 hours of battery life, and functions phenomenally as either a netbook or a tablet.\n\nNow for the bad, the processor is a low power netbook class processor (Intel Atom Baytrail), and as such, isn't going to win any performance awards.  The low memory means that performance might be strained on complex apps as well.  It is absolutely fine for web browsing, word processing, and casual gaming, but it won't handle large games or complex apps.\n\nYou may have to adjust your expectations to get the most out of this device.  While you can install large apps like Photoshop, it won't do complex things extremely well; it just doesn't have the processor power or memory for that.  And while some other things are installable and usable, they may take more patience to use due to the lower performance of the device, Civilization 5 for example.\n\nIn short, if you're looking for a device for web browsing, light productivity, or casual gaming and portability is a requirement, it's hard to go wrong with the T100.  For the price it's almost impossible to beat.\n\nPros:\n- Full Windows 8.1, so you can install your desktop apps (like Chrome) and games.\n- Includes Office, which is almost unheard of for full Windows tablets.\n- Includes the keyboard dock.\n- Great battery life.\n- Good performance for the price\n- Buttery smooth interface\n\nCons:\n- Low performance on large or complex applications.\n- USB port is only on keyboard dock.\n- Somewhat long charging time.\n- Touchpad occasionally glitchy, though this can be greatly diminished by disabling most of the gestures."}

I wanted a tablet/notebook, but I still needed Office (I write, and Word is still the go-to program, for better or worse). I've had Asus netbooks before, and the price made this hard to pass up.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "A tablet with Windows 8.1 is not for everyone. What sold me was having Microsoft Office 2013 pre-installed. It is like having two computers, a windows environment with full Windows 8.1 and a tablet with apps. If you need to use programs that run in the Windows environment but would like a portable tablet as well, this might be the device for you.\n\nI don't like the touchpad; it seems sensitive, but often won't react to a double tap. The touch screen works well, although in Windows desktop mode the icons and controls are too small to work with your fingers. I prefer to use a wireless mouse when I use it in Windows desktop mode. Fingers work well in tablet mode.\n\nThe value of having a Microsoft Windows tablet will likely improve as the number of apps increases."}

The android tablet (which I loved) could do about 80% of what I needed for work, however this comes with full windows and full office and does 100%. I do not carry my laptop around anymore and have since turned it over to my kids.\nI looked at the Dell Venue 11 Pro, the HP 2 x 1 and many others. This has everything I need and was much cheaper than the other options in its class, which in my opinion are way overpriced (thanks the the Ipad).\nI wasn't sure about liking the resolution, but it is perfect for this size, and the screen size makes it perfect for reading and as a tablet. Others greater than about 11\" are just way to big and uncomfortable.\nI would recommend this to anyone. Some have even used it as a desktop replacement, definitely a laptop replacement! Hold off for the 64 GB one if you can, but many people have the 32 GB version and are perfectly happy with that one too.\nThe only problem I had was the learning curve of windows 8 (I always used classicshell for the start menu, but didn't want to on this). The basic apps are available, but still missing some, however that can all be done via the desktop, which is surprisingly easy to use in tablet mode."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I've waited to get a Windows 8 computer until I found something worth the pain of re-learning windows and this is it.  When I heard the specs on this computer I was pretty excited - touchscreen, removable tablet, 11 hr battery life, 2 pounds, real keyboard included, and under $400.  I read some poor reviews about the touchpad and the thing falling over, but those reports are overblown or false.  In the end, I love this thing so much I plan on selling my MacBook Air original & iPad original - this replaces them both.\n\nPros:\n- Low cost ($300 with 64GB on Black Friday)\n- Very long battery life.\n- Runs real Windows 8 - not just the \"Metro\" apps from the app store\n- Thin & light - fits everywhere and easy to carry\n- Good keyboard (although some find it too small)\n- Excellent touch screen\n- Very easy (one button) to detach fully functional Windows 8 tablet\n- On an airplane you can use it all the time because it's under 2 lbs.  If they hassle you, you can just use the tablet until you reach cruising altitude.\n- Display very good.  It's not as high resolution as the new Surface but I don't ever see a problem.  The pixels would be too small for most adults' eyes to be usable at full resolution.\n\nCons:\n- No separate PgUp/PgDn, but Fn+up/Fn+Dn works.\n- micro USB power connector feels like it would be very bad if pulled the wrong way.  Apple magnetic connectors are nice!\n- Windows 8 is nice with the tablet, but it's still schizophrenic between Metro & Windows, and not as easy as an iPad (eg pinch Zoom isn't always available esp in regular Windows).\n- There aren't yet many dedicated cases.  People are trying all sorts of alternative cases without finding a perfect fit.\n\nThe touchpad isn't the world's best but it doesn't feel too cheap to me and more importantly, it works fine.  People are complaining about the feel & sound of clicking on the lower left/right but you don't need to do that at all - just tap anywhere to click.\n\nThe other concern I've seen is about the balance of the LCD vs keyboard and it falling over.  I don't understand this.  I've never had it fall over.  Now, I have seen a video about a guy who disassembles the keyboard and removes the metal plate there to reduce the weight by a huge amount.  That setup probably is top heavy.  The stock T100 never falls back.\n\nI've also seen on the TransformerForums.com concerns about power issues - not going to sleep, waking up when closed and draining the battery, etc.  I haven't seen those problems personally, but it seems that these may be related to a bad version of the BIOS which is user upgradeable.  If you are seeing problems, you should update.  If you aren't seeing problems then don't.\n\nThe only problem I've found is that I can't change the power buttons or lid to Hibernate instead of sleep.  It doesn't matter much with such long battery life, but it still uses .5%-2% per hour while sleeping, and the startup is so quick I prefer to Hibernate.  I eventually installed \"Start8\" which gives you the old start button back including Hibernate.\n\nI've read about WiFi disconnecting, and I've had some problems, but I think my problem is actually with my networks because I've seen it happen side-by-side with another Win7 laptop.\n\nI can't see why someone would want a Surface 2 for $450 which won't run real Windows desktop programs, or pay twice that for a Surface Pro 2 which won't do anything more than this.  This laptop rocks.  It's the device I grab when I want to quickly surf the web or check email.  It's also what I grab when I want to watch TV and do some real work.  I also like to use LogMeIn to remote to my desktop and do some real serious work.  It's a great laptop and you'll love it."}

This is product of the year for me. I am now looking to order more for parents and brother. The problem is due best selling status, as it is sold out/limited/low stock multiple times, low availability everywhere causing significant price hike.\n\nWhen I get the product, it can not be turned on. Simply leaving it charged for few hours and it now can power on. After that i am updating all drivers I can find, and it becomes much more responsive than initial condition. Later I also put bios update for remedy of power can't on issue which occasionally I had if I need to shutdown this machine. As a bonus, from benchmark, updating bios and graphic driver makes this device even faster and smoother trackpad.\n\nDecent speed FULL Windows 8.1+Free Office in a netbook works for me. I had Ipad and tried Android, but on productivity side nothing compares to this. I actually left my Ipad battery died because of this T100.\n\nThis is of course not for heavyweight usage, I had MSI GT70 for that, but I have tested that a lot of games playable at low quality. My usage leans on Office, PDF reading, Manga Reading (MangaZ), Mail (Windows Mail), browsing, and as remote control for another laptop, Anime/Movie player. KLite and media player classic works well without hiccup even for Full HD resolution+ FLAC. Even watching flash is not a problem with this thing.\n\nPro\n+ Cheap but very useful\n+ Proper multitasking and snappy\n+ Light and when you want to you can remove the dock to be even lighter\n+ Relatively large IPS at cheap level.

Update your BIOS if you had older version through Asus LiveUpdate, this will solve a lot of problem\n2. Disable or uninstall the Asus Reading Mode\n3. Disable gesture on trackpad, if you feel you had flimsy trackpad\nOn the Desktop, double click \"Asus Smart Gesture\" on the Taskbar notification (bottom right in desktop). Go to \"Edge Gesture\" and turn off them. Edge gesture is not needed as you can do the same with touchscreen, and in fact hinders you due to small touchpad.\n\n4. If you struggle on step 1-3 or not IT person or do not want to learn, get help from friend. I had fixed two supposed to be lemon version of this machines by doing 1-3 (plus leaving in charge for a day and windows reset).\n\n5.

Eventually the loose battery connection prevented the tablet from running even when plugged in using the charger. The tablet seemed dead as it would never power on (battery was actually okay but the connection to the motherboard was loose). I pushed the plug all the way into the socket and made sure it was seated properly.\n\nAll is well now, the tablet runs fine.

The bay trail tablet was very smooth and works well, but unfortunately the initial one that I got was a lemon.  I went to the MS store near my house and they replaced the tablet due to the issues I was having with it.  I think Asus has a great product and would have given it 5 stars if they (Asus) did the following.\n\nCons:\n\n1. Make the screen 10.6 or 11 inch and make the keyboard less cramped.\n2. QA is a huge issue, Asus needs to grow up and deal with the fact Microsoft has the Surface.  Asus is a excellent company that makes amazing products for the average consumer.  The lack in Quality Assurance is inexcusable, too many lemons are floating around and Asus needs to address this problem right away before they tarnish the Transformer product line.\n3. Microsoft needs to work harder with their partners, update pushes should be centralized.\n4. The feel could be better and if not metal at least hard rubberized back so the user doesn't feel like they are going to break it every time they use it.\n5.  The tablet should be rubberized so it can act as a built-in cover.\n\nPros:  Many....just a few listed below\n\n1.  Asus packaged office 2013 student edition...\n2.

For those who are still having issues, before you return it to the place of purchase, and if you have a Microsoft store near by, have them take a look at it.  Its worth it, considering 64gb bay trail tablet is hard to come by at this price point.  The reason I took it to the MS store instead of returning was because my 2nd option was a Dell Venue which would have ran me $700.00, which I was not ready to spend on a tablet."}

Problems with a Windows Update resulted in sending it back because my computer programming husband could not even get the computer to boot. Since then, we've had problems with an app corrupting (possibly not the computer's fault), the volume control sticking on (which makes swipe functions obsolete), the computer refusing to start because it has no charge (although it was remained in sleep mode ever since being plugged in). Even when it is working \"well\" the power button to wake it from sleep is unreliable, and programs crash frequently. Avoid this product."}

Of course, she's not waiting - already uses it to watch movies, browse the internet, etc. in the comfort and convenience of her own room.  Problem is:  it shuts off if its idle for a few minutes - and then takes forever to turn back on.  She showed me today how long it takes to turn back on, and it's WAAAAY too long. Was thinking to replace it, but she said she googled it and lots of other complaints about the same problem.

I can't believe this machine can do soooooo much and then read that people complain about what it can't do. Want a super game toy.. buy something else. Want to compare it to a full desktop or laptop.. buy something else. The screen not big enough or too much plastic.. seriously ?\n\nSo for you realistic adults (or adult minded), wanting to mostly duplicate a regular computer's capabilities with portability, then this is the most comprehensive tablet I've seen for this cost. Is there a learning curve ? Yes..gee. Is Win 8.1 some wildly different animal from Win 7 ? Not hardly. Are there some limitations ? Of course ! Is there a paper manual big as a book ? No. There is a huge free .pdf manual loaded to use.\n\nInvest the time to read reviews. Weed out the trolls or simpletons. Be smart and patient enough to read, take notes, and FOLLOW the useful reviews here BEFORE you boot the machine. I had zero problems because so many reviewers are wiser than me. Thanks to all for taking your time to educate. It's valuable.\n\nI've loaded one of my regular programs to clean the registry, etc. There are other maintenance programs already installed. Don't do any regular maintenance and this tablet will end up as so many computers...useless.\n\nI bought this tablet on 12/27/13, as listed (Win 8.1,MS Office, 64gb), then purchased a shock case, a few extra cables and a 64gb SD card for $ 516. (frt. inc.). Unbelievable. A week has gone by. I'm more impressed every day. If this tablet gives me at least two years of productivity it will be worth every dime."}

After a reboot  Office 2013 had successfully installed with no problems. Others mentioned problems with the build quality but I encountered no such issues. The screen is nice and it is fast, it carries the new Intel Z3740 chip and it is quad core plus it has Win 8 (free upgrade to 8.1 through the Windows store) or Win 8.1.  It is not a power house so don't expect it to perform like an Intel i7 processor. This is just for everyday use. I have not encountered any problems during setup. However I did not purchase it for myself and I haven't had any complaints from the user. So I'll highly recommend it based on my initial experience with it plus not getting any complaints about it from the user."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "Pros:\n\n-Comes with a keyboard. There aren't many (if any) that offer that standard.\n\n-Windows 8.1 is fantastically smooth. I literally opened all of the programs and apps I had (11) and it was still running smoothly.\n\n-Intel Atom Bay Trail Processor. Uses much less energy to do the same task than the Intel i series or even the previous generation Atoms. Look for Intel Z3000 series to make sure it has Bay Trail.\n\n-11 hour battery life. I can kill it in 8 if I use it constantly. But it usually lasts much longer if you have it set to go to sleep after being idle for 5 minutes.\n\n-64GB Solid State Drive. Makes for extremely fast startup, restart, shutdown, and wakeups. 15 seconds to home screen from cold start.\n\n-Comes with Microsoft Office 2013. Fantastic addition saving you from going out and buying a copy.\n\nCons:\n\n-Long charging time, about 6 hours from what I could tell. But that's acceptable when I only have to charge it once a day.\n\n-Flimsy Keyboard. The keyboard is very flexible and mine wasn't square meaning all 4 corners of the keyboard did not touch a flat surface.\n\n-Small Keyboard, Not to be unexpected, however the right shift key is smaller than the left. Making for a lot of mistakes.\n\n-Bad hinge design. Mine may have been defective, but it started to have connectivity issues after a month. It would disconnect from the tablet if it was open more than 90 degrees.\n\n-Plain design. A boring grey color covers the entire thing. Not objectively bad, but it was easily preventable. Probably grey to keep costs down.\n\n-Asus Smart Gesture is awful. Smart gesture allows the user to use various shortcut functions by using the edges of the touch pad but it is too easy to accidentally trigger. I uninstalled the software completely.\n\nOther Thoughts:\n\nOverall, I gave this a 4 out of 5 because it sets a new standard for what a tablet should be. I shouldn't have to settle for 5 hours of battery life. I shouldn't have to settle with slow start up times or buggy software. I shouldn't have to settle for a toy. I should have a device that is portable and still usable to get actual work done. This tablet absolutely delivers.\n\nGranted my situation is a little unique. I don't own a smart phone and have a very nice desktop. This tablet fills my mobile needs entirely.\n\nThe defective keyboard was very professionally handled by Asus and had it back to me in almost a week. I couldn't be happier with the service I got. But the keyboard is the reason I gave this a 4 instead of a 5\n\nGet a skin for it. Cases are very awkward when every side has some sort of connector or port on it. Skinomi makes a great skin and it will prevent the scratches that are bound to happen to a plastic bodied tablet.\n\nThe direct competitor to this tablet, in my opinion, is the Dell Venue Pro 8 or Dell Venue Pro 11. Look into those as well before you buy.\n\nThe price point for this tablet is $399.99. Don't pay more or you're getting ripped off."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I am extremely impressed with this little computer.  As a working man's machine, it exceeds my expectations.  Unlike a number of reviews I read, I am not disappointed by the weight/feel of this computer, nor do I have any real issues with Windows 8.1.  If you have lived around these things for awhile, then you remember everyone crying when we went from DOS to Windows 3.11, to Windows 95, XP, Windows 7 and so on...  yes, people cried about the demise of DOS!  If your ego will allow, get yourself a primer on Windows 8 and try to ignore the redundant stuff you already know.  Trust me... a quick read will lower the Win 8 frustration a great deal.\n\nIn terms of the feel, if the ASUS was any lighter, it would feel flimsy, if it was any heavier, it would not satisfy that ultra portable description.  I found myself walking around the house while I configured this computer with about the same effort as holding a technical manual.  As others have reported, a full day's use only drained the battery about 50%.  Although I have been very satisfied with ASUS motherboards in the past, it remains to be proven how this will standup in the real world of being tossed into cars or being thrown around inside one's baggage.\n\nSetting the computer up without reading a Windows 8 book was a bit of a learning experience.  I did read the comments and disabled Windows Automatic Updates initially, and installed ASUS Critical Updates (including the BIOS 220 flash) and then ran the Windows updates.  Consequently, I have seen none of the erratic power management problems others have reported.  I will admit, I only waited two hours while charging before I started configuring with the power cord plugged in... no problems.  I also got a full (100%) charge after just five hours out of the box.\n\nI am an old-school \"OG\" programmer who needs this machine to run a specific set of full Windows software, including some old stuff. This is proving to be not a problem in the least. This is a full-blown Windows 8.1 tablet PC with a somewhat beefy processor... this ain't your daddy's Atom CPU.  My expectations are as follows:\n\n1.  Use Microsoft .Net Framework applications, including .Net Framework 3.5.\n\n2.  Install and cleanly run legacy Microsoft Office products, including MS Access 2003 with the VB 6 editor.\n\n3.  Use Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connection to cleanly access my primary desktop computer while on the road.\n\n4.  Access and use Windows FTP.\n\n5.  Connect and use presentation projectors.\n\n6.  Smoothly use conferencing services (i.e. \"join.me,\" Go to Meeting, etc.)\n\nNo problem with the legacy .Net Framework 3.5.  I did enable it manually in Control Panel, but that is probably unnecessary if your app uses Clickonce deployment.  It should install and enable on its own I think.  The desktop app I loaded was a heavy database program that frankly ran smoother on the ASUS then it runs on most desktop computers I see at my client's sites.\n\nI also loaded MS Access 2003 with a very large database and it too installed and ran without a hitch.  The VB6/VBA editor works fine with most of the COM libraries available... yeah, I still have a bunch of old MS Access applications out there that I must continue to support.  I did note that the FoxPro ODBC object was not available in Windows 8 while installing this old Office software.\n\nMost of the Windows file tools are available and work fine, including Windows FTP that worked... well like Windows FTP. RDP connections worked fine, so if I need to make a code modification in the field, I can connect to my development computer and have access to everything in Visual Studio.  I expected the screen to be too small, but the RDP view proved to be very workable.\n\nSame comments when using join.me and LogMeIn remote sections.  If the screens were any smaller, it would be a problem but the 10.1 inch T100T screen is just large enough to work well.\n\nIf you are going to connect to other monitors or projectors, you will need to carry an array of connectors and converters, but that's nothing unusual.  I did not try a projector, but I don't see any real issues with connecting and using a projector for training or sales presentations.\n\nI will add that this computer runs very smooth and is fast out the box.  However, it remains to be proven to me that Microsoft has done anything that improves the performance degradation as the registry get's munched up over time.  What is speedy on day one may be a different story after regularly using the machine for a year.\n\nAll in all, for a working man/woman, the ASUS T100T meets and exceeds all of my requirements and then some more.  After spending a few hours reading a beginner's Windows 8 manual, I actually feel I am going to like this relatively new Windows OS.\n\nIf you are looking for a cutsy computer to play games, run single-function vendor specific apps and never need to interact with the normal business office environment, then get an Android or Apple product.  If you need a computer that works with the way most people still perform real business functions, this computer is for you, especially for the price.\n\nUpdate 1/18/2013:  I've been using this machine for about three or four weeks now, and this T100T is performing even better than expected.  Most of the bad comments I've read appear to stem from people who take the computer out of the box and turn it on without heeding any of the advice posted in these reviews.\n\nMainly, the BIOS update flash BEFORE you enable Windows Updates cannot be overstressed.  If you apply certain Windows Updates with the old BIOS, you WILL have power management problems (i.e. not turning on, fast battery discharge, slow charging, etc.).  If you are not tech savvy, pay your grandson/daughter to take the machine out of the box and check/install the BIOS flash.\n\nMy guess is that ASUS has a few shipping containers filled with partially or completely assembled T100T devices with the BIOS pre-flashed by the manufacturer somewhere offshore.  Thus, this could go on for a while, so check your BIOS version and be sure it is a version greater than 220 (use MSINFO32 in the Search charm) before you enable Windows Automatic Updates.\n\nAs a result of heeding the advice, I experienced zero problems from Day One.  If you are using Windows 8.1 and a Windows tablet for the first time, you do need to learn how Windows 8.1 works from a practical perspective... this probably accounts for most of the other low ratings.  I am not going to say Windows 8.1 is a better or worse OS, I am going to say it is different.  Read a basic tutorial book on Windows 8.1.  I am going to go out on a limb and say I actually like it!\n\nOn the other end are comments about features included in this computer.  I think that this product is purpose engineered, and that purpose is a computer designed for business road-warriors at a specific price-point.  Thus, the camera is there for video conferencing using conferencing applications like Go To Meeting or Skype, not for taking pictures of your vacation.  You want an Instamatic, use your phone camera... and if you want to take good pictures, well... get a REAL camera.\n\nThe processor and memory are optimized to run software applications commonly used in business.  The Bay Trail processor runs every application I loaded so far without a hitch, and it does this at very low power consumption.  Just as a test, I loaded a very resource intensive photo book editing application that ran well... not lighting fast, but more than adequate if I wanted to work on this book project away from my desktop computer.  No, I don't think the machine will efficiently run the most demanding 3D video game, but that is outside of the scope of the purpose design I think.\n\nLast week, I drove four hours to a client site listening to music on the T100T (plugged into the charger) and arrived at 8:00 AM with a full 100% charge.  I plugged into a projector at the client site, and trained my clients all day long using the T100T on battery power to demonstrate procedures using a number of custom and common Windows applications.  During a break, I remotely performed a client installation using Join.me, and finished at the site in the late afternoon with more than a 60% left in the batteries.  It suits my business proposes perfectly."}

When it arrived, I switched keyboards with my old one and then sold the 32gb tablet with the old keyboard for $300.00!\n\nI have found that adding the keyboard dock with the internal hard drive has a serious drain on the overall battery life of the tablet, but that was to be expected as SOMETHING has to power the hard drive. The 500 GB hard drive that comes with the dock is 5400 RPM. It's a spindle drive so that means quicker burn on your battery life.

What caught me off-guard was exactly how little this machine couldn't do. As a replacement for a standard laptop, this is feasible if you don't mind the somewhat clunky keyboard, and are not using anything more than word/excel. This is definitely not a workhorse setup, so if you have plans on doing real intensive computations, like video editing, this isn't what you want. For general media use, standard web browsing, and using office, the T100 does a great job. I recommend at least getting a screen protector, one that doesn't collect fingerprints.\nIn all, a great buy at the $400 mark. *Perfect for anyone looking for something between a tablet and an ultrabook.\n\nPros: Light(ish) weight, long battery life, clear and bright screen, keyboard with touchpad, easy web browsing, good for media consumption, good for phone/tablet style games.\n\nCons: Plastic shell feels a bit flexible sometimes, touchpad is a little cheap/clicks loudly, standard USB 3.0 on dock only (microUSB on tablet), regular screen attracts fingerprints( and so does the back side), not for graphically intensive games\n\n*Not a huge fan of the windows 8/8.1 setup, but that's what comes on this pre-installed. Not a real drawback in tablet mode, but it shares the same cumbersome mouse interface that desktops with windows 8/8.1 do - hover at the edge of the screen to get to specific menus, 'slide' actions are difficult or annoying, and shutting it down (not standbye/sleep) takes a good 3-4 menus. None of this relates to the T100, just windows 8/8.1 in general."}

I got the 64 GB version.  The keyboard took a little time to get used to because it is so small.  But once I got used it for while its works fine. Occasionally the touch pad seems finicky.  I find that I use the touch screen to select or navigate around so it is not an issue for me.  Keyboard seems fragile. I don't think it would survive a fall.  Battery lasts a long time.  Windows starts up quickly.  I got a 64GB microSD card for added storage.  Plenty of processing power for me.  I use it for work (email, Word, Excel) and watch on-line videos.  Windows 8 is easy to learn.  Lots of tutorials and on-line help.  Had a little scare...after an update Windows wouldn't start.  After googling the problem I found out others have had the same problem.  The solution is to hold down the start key for ~15 sec.  That worked. I haven't had the problem since.  Don't know if a following update  fixed it.  I also updated the bios firmware afterwards.  I chalk it up to Windows.  I would have given it a 5 if it weren't for that issue.  Again, not sure it is an ASUS issue.  I'm guessing it was a Microsoft problem.\n\nBottom line, if you want the flexibility Windows provides (file sharing, etc.) and don't mind the occasional Microsoft Windows hick-ups a Windows tablet is the way to go.  This is one of the least expensive you'll fine considering the processor speed and accompanying keyboard."}

Then when you turn it on, make sure it is plugged when you connect to the net because there are a massive amounts of W8.1 and Asus updates., can ASUS please fix that ambient light sensor. the first 4 minutes of automatic up and down with the brightness (at night) is very annoying.\nIf you get this Tab/NB make sure you have the \"ASUS live update program\"  I guess the MS store thought it was bloatware and removed it possibly. You definitely want the live update program to download install Asus updates and bios updates Mine did not have it and when I went to ASUS driver site I saw it was available for download instead of me trying to update the bios myself (just a note, I see that you cannot uninstall this program, could ASUS be recording what I do? Thanks Asus for finally having a program to handle your updates.\nYes the screen is not that bright for outside, forget watching any dark videos, but for browsing and reading I can read the screen (not direct sunlight). It;s a shame the Transformer 700 has I think like 600 nit brightness and this only has 300.\nTrackpad: I turned off all gestures and instead of tapping to left click you have to press down for the click and 4 out of 5 times, the cursor moves when I press down (it's actually easier to do the touchscreen instead of the trackpad, LOL. There is an Asus update to correct the trackpad oversensitivity problem.\nSuggestions for Asus. Since this is mostly used (for me) as a tablet, the charger connection should be on the keyboard not the screen part.. This way I won't have to be plugging in and out all the time with that tiny connector (less wear and tear on that tiny connector plugging in and out). Overall I am happy with this product. Considering I still have the 4 year old Asus single core atom netbook running XP (still going strong, LOL).  Now if hard drive space is a concern on your check out the portable apps website.  Overall I am happy with it and yes, this is my first W 8.1 version and I hate it (never had version 8, charm bar a waste, metro apps a waste, to get to something I have to go through so many taps/ windows, I also do not need to create an account for MS store (do a search on the web for bypassing creation of account, I just use a login name and password, I turned of all the widgets because I do not need to sync, see weather or email.  It is an atom processor after all and why tax it with useless programs. For my preference I also disabled, server, homegroup, workstation, indexing, prefetch, and the font prefetch.  Have fun with it, thanks Asus."}

It is the only device out there that fits the bill for what I needed, compact, easy to use, Windows 8.1 (instead of the dreaded featureless RT)- detachable for surfing the net on the couch.... all for a great price point! THAT however is where it all ends. I received this device as a Christmas gift for my wife, and tried it out for a few days to get it ready to give to her on Christmas. The device was very buggy, shutting off at random and then wouldn't restart unless you did some magical dance, stood on your head and who knows what else. So I boxed it up and sent it back, received a second one from Amazon- which worked great for Christmas day and the day after. Then it began behaving the same way. It does not stay on, it has trouble charging, and worse, there are times it literally will not turn on no matter what I do.\nASUS Customer support is simply non-existent. Nothing but a huge run-around in broken English. I experienced the same poor service with an ASUS laptop I purchased earlier this year and swore I would not do business with them ever again. I decided to give them one more chance, figuring how hard could it be to make a simple little convertible tablet? Apparently more difficult than I thought! I could be like other reviewers and \"say\" I work in IT so that would give me more credibility, but does that really matter? Do you work in IT or are you the average user? Chances are you are an average user- so let me save you the frustration, headache and disappointment.\n\nBottom line, save your money and buy a better made device from HP, DELL or IBM. That's what I'm going to have to do. It could be windows updates that are causing it, (although I think it is a defective power button), but I will no longer be purchasing any ASUS products. Not because they are defective but because they are poorly built and even more poorly supported. Too bad, because they used to be a good value."}

It holds a charge for a long time, but it doesn't charge very well if you are using it while it is charging. If I charge it overnight, I normally have no problem using it all day with no problem. The power cord is very short, but I bought an extension USB and that works pretty well to extend the cord.\n\nI love how light it is, as I am able to take it with me wherever I go. It is convenient that it comes with Microsoft Office and the Windows 8 interface is easy to navigate once you get the hang of it.\n\nOne thing that bothered me was the mousepad on the keyboard kept performing certain actions while I was trying to move the mouse around. I finally figured out that I could disable those functions and after that, I haven't had a problem. Another note about the mouse, when you click it, it is fairly loud, so not the best for quiet environments. But considering you can tap to click or you can just use the touchscreen to navigate, I haven't been to bothered by that.\n\nThe one USB port is on the keyboard, so you must be connected to the keyboard to use a jump drive. I find the keyboard easy to type on and I leave the keyboard connected most of the time, so it's not a problem.\n\nOverall, I think it's a good buy. I'm hoping that it will hold up well over time!"}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I am an Apple convert. Previously I used an iPad 3 with a Belkin keyboard to take notes at meetings, review documents and send quick emails in a work setting. The iPad was my second computing device - I had a laptop, but I needed something lighter and with longer battery life to lug around from meeting to meeting. The iPad fit my needs, except for the terrible file management choices that Apple made, which make routine tasks like adding (non-picture) attachments to an email reply almost impossible.\nEnter Asus T100. At least on paper, this has everything that I needed: small size, physical keyboard, long battery life, and an operating system that pays attention to productivity driven users.\nWhat I like about it:\n- battery life is as expected, when using the device\n- the core Windows experience is still there. Boring, but it gets out of the way for productivity tasks, unlike iOS7\n- touch screen laptops are the way of the future.\n\nWhat I dislike:\n- software integration isn't Asus / Microsoft's strong suit. You have to put up with random annoyances like the the volume overlay not disappearing off the screen once you're done with it, or the software keyboard appearing on screen even when the physical keyboard is connected.\n- I've also encountered more serious bugs, like the physical software going AWOL - turning itself off. To get it back - a machine reset was necessary.\n- the thing that's really disappointing is that in spite of the long battery life, the Asus / Microsoft combo hasn't quite mastered the standby. This thing would be dead in 24 hours, whether I use it or not. My iPad could last on standby for weeks.\n- the Windows 8 split personality. Two applications for OneNote, both fighting for control of my notes. In general, the metro style apps are a bit too design oriented, and sometimes that does get in the way of their functionality.\n- What good is being able to touch the screen, if I can't pinch to zoom? Most Windows programs support this, but on a 10 inch device, you really need this. Chrome (the web browser) does not support pinch to zoom, which basically makes it unusable. Pity, because IE (both versions) are not as good.\n- Asus bloatware. I keep ignoring their offers for backup and other useless stuff. I'd gladly pay a bit more to be left alone.\n- Physical design is mediocre. Buttons can't be controlled by feel only (I've pressed the Windows button numerous types when I was trying to operate volume), the trackpad doesn't have any feel to it, the keys are uncomfortable (after using the Belkin keyboard for the iPad, I know it's possible to make a decent small keyboard)\n\nIn the end, this does the job, but barely. I've had it 4 months, but I'm already looking for other alternatives."}

However, after going through all the set-up instructions, my keyboard did not work after my initial log-in to Microsoft.  The tablet worked great and I am getting used to Windows 8.1.  But if I wanted just a tablet I would have bought one.  I discussed this with ASUS support personnel once via their on-line chat where they went through several steps, refreshed my computer, etc.  (NOTE:  I am not a computer  person,  more like \"turn it on and type\".)  That did not work.  Called and talked to an actual person who tried many things, but still no go.  So, I was told to send my computer to ASUS (free shipping both ways) and they would look at it.  Got it back a week later, but they keyboard still would not work after my initial log-in to Microsoft.  This was frustrating because I knew the keyboard worked because I could always type the initial log-in.  So, after scrolling through Amazon, ASUS, and Microsoft, forums/reviews, I finally saw something about a filter.  By the grace of God, I remembered stumbling across this somewhere in the set-up stuff (I think where the Narrator part is) and I was able to turn off the keyboard filter.  Finally, after 2+ weeks, I was able to use the keyboard for my Office programs.  YEAH.\n\nAnother issue I have is that the instructions are so limited.  As I said, I am not computer savvy, and I need more detailed instructions in WRITTEN form in a booklet.  I did not see anything in any instructions I saw, that addressed the issues I was having.  It was such a simple thing (turn off the keyboard filter), but I ended up sending my computer to ASUS and almost returned it.  Also, the camera photos are not very sharp/clear.  Nevertheless, I love the portability and flexibility of this product.  I haven't used it much since I figured out the keyboard issue, but, if it continues working as it should, I think we'll have a lasting relationship."}

After having the asus transformer for just five days, this is now my go-to device for most of those tasks.  It is super fast, ultra portable and lightweight, and has great battery life -  I always charge it overnight, and I have not seen the battery run out yet.\n\nIt took a day or two for me to completely adjust to windows 8.1, but now that I got the hang of it, I like how customizable the start page is, and I like how easy it is to see all of your programs when you swipe up form start.  I also like how easy it is to switch from app to app, and how you can use a split screen to view two apps at once.  I really appreciate that Office home and student comes included and preinstalled.  I never imagined I would be able to write papers and create powerpoints on a tablet!  As a full-time teacher and part time graduate student, that made this product so much more valuable to me.  I purchased a microUSB to USB adapter and a microHDMI to VGA converter to increase the usability of the device.\n\nI picked up some tips from other reviewers that may have made my experience go so smoothly.  First, I charged my device for a full 8 hours before I did anything else (a true test of patience).  Then, I turned off the edge gestures on the touchpad settings as directed by other reviewers, and I changed the update settings from automatic to manual.  I have had no problems at all.  I am still getting used to the smaller keyboard, but I imagine I will continue to adjust with time.\n\nIt is really incredible how much you get for the price.

The action is fine (chicklet keys), though obviously a bit cramped. No number pad which is to be expected (impossible on this size).\n* Windows 8.1 - this can be a bone of contention. I know many don't like W8 but in the Windows tablet world it's your only choice. And really, it's pretty good. For basic service I actually have begun to like the Metro interface, which works wonderfully in a touch environment (though it fails quite a bit in a mouse-driven system). I like the apps and the way they display news, travel, food and other topics, making it a really nice way to get the basics done. Going beyond that may require using desktop, which isn't as easy in touch, but you've always got the keyboard.\n* FULL Version of Office 2013 Home and Student. This is a ridiculous value and would cost well over $100 bucks on it's own. Work, PowerPoint, Excel and OneNote and they all work fast and flawlessly.\n* Great battery life - I charge it far less than I thought I'd need to. It easily gets me though the day with no problem.\n* Bluetooth, webcam and MicroSD card slot - the obvious things one would want, but the card slot is too often missing from many devices.\n\nSpeed-wise, I'm extremely happy, though the 2GB of ram can let it down at times. In fact, that's my only complaint; were this a 4GB or 8GB machine (or were it expandable)  it'd be a five star unit.\n\nA great machine at a great price. Highly recommended."}

If you are torn between a laptop and a tablet, there are definitely some advantages to this device.\n- It is fast for tablet.\n- The touch screen is responsive.\n- The screen is of good quality.\n- You can use some PC programs, such as the included Microsoft Office, and even play the PC version of Minecraft.\n- It is lightweight and portable.\n\nWhat to consider if you are in the market for a laptop:\n- The screen size is only 10\". While this might be great for a road warrior, I find using a laptop with a screen this small somewhat awkward. You could also argue that a smaller screen uses less battery life and is better for travel.\n- For the price, you could have a laptop with a larger screen, a DVD drive, a larger hard drive, faster processor, and more RAM. In other words, you have chosen to sacrifice speed for portability.\n- The keyboard is surprisingly good, if slightly stiff, for a sub-standard sized keyboard.\n- The trackpad is terribly stiff, even after many hours of use. I only use it in laptop mode if I have a mouse plugged into it.\n\nWhat to consider if you are in the market for a tablet:\n- This looks less slick than other tablets of this size in this price range.\n- You are using a full version of Windows 8.x. At this time, the Windows app store is frustratingly small. If you plan to use this as a tablet, please take a look at the apps available for Windows. Hopefully the market place will grow by leaps and bounds, but right now there isn't much there. Obviously you will not be able to utilize apps available from Google Play.\n\nOverall, I am delighted with the speed of this device, especially considering the hardware it is sporting. I have not had any issues with speed. The Windows 8 learning curve is definitely high at first, but that is not the fault of this device and will be a problem with any full Windows bases touch screen device you purchase.\n\nThe packaging is lovely and reminds me of higher end products. The inclusion of a USB drive is a nice touch. The lousy mouse is terrible enough to be warrant 4 stars instead of 5."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "For the money, this tablet is an absolute beast.  It truly is a full windows laptop in a tablet form-factor.\n\nI've been using my 64GB model for over a month now.  Among the things it can do that an iPad of any flavor cannot:\n\n*  Print to my 5 year old deskjet, either wirelessly or via USB\n*  Play/Burn CD/DVD/BluRay (with an external drive)\n*  Run VMWare and/or Hyper-V\n*  Connect to my Wacom digitizing tablet\n*  Run full-blown Photoshop and Illustrator\n*  Run almost any legacy Windows application\n*  Play most Steam games\n*  Accept MicroSD without an additional ($$) adapter\n*  Recharge from any MicroUSB charger (though possibly slowly, depending on mA rating of charger)\n*  Connect multiple peripherals simultaneously via USB hub\n*  Connect USB thumb drive without additional adapter\n*  Connect second screen via micro-HDMI and have extended desktop.\n*  Will still be able to accept updates from 2+ years from now\n\nThis is off the top of my head.  Among the \"warts\" this device has:\n\n*  Plastic constuction (you'll likely want to get a case for it anyway -- all tablets are FAR TOO easy to break)\n*  Not a retina display.  Not even remotely close. (But let's face facts: a really pretty screen only goes so far when your other funcationality is severely limited.  For me and many others, this is a decent tradeoff.  This screen does not suck.  It's not not uber high-res like the iPad)\n*  The manufacturer is Asus, and they have historically HORRIBLE post-sale support.  (this really is the worst thing about this tablet and the one that gave me the most pause).\n\nHaving used Windows since the earliest days, I have been turned off by Windows 8 and the aggravating Metro UI.  With the release of Windows 8.1 and the ease of jumping between the deskop UI and Metro, this tablet does a great job straddling the funtionality of a true laptop and a tablet.  After a small amount of getting used to, I'm growing to like Windows 8.1.\n\nMany claim (correctly) that iOS has significantly more apps than any other tablet platform.  While this is true, how many apps does a person need?  1 million?  100,000?  The ability to install/run almost any legacy Windows app on this tablet is HUGE.\n\nWhile I'd still recommend an iPad to parents and anybody else to avoid getting tech-support phone calls, I'd eagerly recommend this to anyone reasonably computer savvy over the iPad.  Comparitively, the iPad is a beautiful, well-built, well-supported TOY that simply can't compare in terms of versatility and potential for productivity.  Pretty, trendy, and cool only go so far."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "Anyone who converts video or music generally will want to always have access to a \"real\" PC.  Also, a person who wants to backup music or video files to an external USB drive will more than likely want to have access to a PC.  This can serve in those capacities nicely, as well as convert to a large tablet to take to Starbucks or to just sit at home on the couch and browse the web.  The Windows 8.1 Metro style with its \"live tiles\" is easy to get used to and very nice looking.  I really have grown to like it, and have installed the Flipboard app, and several free games from the Windows store.  (The Kindle app is already installed and works very well.)  Plus there is a start button and desktop that looks very much like Windows 7 for the old school folks.  The Asus version I got comes with a license key for MS Office for Students and Home.  That's a nice plus if you need to work with Office documents, but I haven't installed it and probably won't.\n\nTo sum up:\n\nPros:\n\n-Lower price than most other large tablets\n-Operating system guaranteed to be updated for many years\n-Great battery life at ~12 hours\n-Included detachable keyboard\n-USB port for external drives, DVD burners or mice\n-Windows Metro, which includes very well designed apps for Bing news, health news, sports news, as well as a large collection of 3rd party apps such as Flipboard, Kindle, many popular games, etc.\n-Storage memory can be upgraded with a micro SD card, up to 64 gigabytes in size\nUses the standard micro USB cable for charging\nBluetooth connectivity for use with speakers, bluetooth mice, etc.\nFree cloud storage thru Microsoft\nFree cloud storage thru Asus\n\nCons:\n\n-Cannot play the latest/greatest PC games...for that you would need a desktop PC or a gamer notebook, either of which would cost a lot more than this device.\n-Battery cannot be removed by the user.\n-System memory cannot be upgraded any further than the included 2 gigabytes\n-Only 1 USB port, and that is on the keyboard\n-Camera is only 1.2 megapixels...obviously designed for Skyping but not for picture taking!\n\nExtended review:\n\nFor the most part, this device will serve my needs for a Windows PC, plus a large format tablet.  Most of us have been reading the dire warnings for the upcoming security issues for PCs using Windows XP.  Both of my PCs run XP because I never had a reason to upgrade to Vista or Windows 7.  I know my current PCs don't have the capability to run Windows 8, so I was concerned. This PC solved that problem for me, as well as answered my need for a larger tablet.  I had considered an Ipad Air, but didn't want to pay $600-700 for one with sufficient storage that I wouldn't feel cramped.  I also considered an Android, but I have some concerns about security on those devices, plus the cost of a good one is up there with the Ipads.  And, this one has the keyboard included!\n\nConcerning security on Android: I have several Android devices and I love them except for the fact that the version of Android (or derivative version of Android) that each of them operate on are probably never going to be updated any further.  That means that all the security features being written into Kitkat will not be made available to those who have these so-called \"legacy\" devices.  This has been discussed on several tech web sites and is a serious concern.  To me this is the biggest problem with the practice of leaving it up to the device manufacturers (or the phone service carriers) to decide when/if my phone or tablet will ever receive any upgrades!  When a device is new, it may receive incremental upgrades, but simply put, there is no guarantee that it will receive even that, let alone a major upgrade such as from Jellybean to KitKat.  I also have a Kindle Fire and I have not seen Amazon come out with any security related updates, and no announcement seems forthcoming.  (You can invest in a third party software, the discussion of which is out of the scope of my review due to varying opinions about the effectiveness of such products verses something written into the operating system itself.  Keep in mind that you can also use a third party software with this Windows 8 tablet, thus having even more protection.  The best solutions seem to involve setting up a VPN (google it), which can be problematic depending on the device.)  Anyway, back to my review.  :)\n\nThe OS on this PC will be updated by Microsoft for a number of years.  I want to emphasize the importance of this!  The Microsoft EOL schedule shows when support for each version of the Windows operating system will cease.  According to the EOL schedule, Win XP will not be supported after April, 8, 2014.  Considering that it was released well over a decade ago, I think that is more than fair.  The _Windows 8_ lifecycle is this: mainstream support will end January 9, 2018, but extended support will end January 10, 2023.  This means that for 4 more years, the whole operating system will receive updates, and for 9 years, there will be minimal support for updates.  Can you imagine a 4 year old Android or Iphone continuing to receive any OS updates at all?\n\nTalking more about the hardware:  Along with the included keyboard, other advantages to this device are the USB port on the keyboard that can accept a USB drive, mouse, etc. just like any other notebook PC. The speakers have good sound, the screen is bright and clear and has a great viewing angle.  Advanced core power-saving features provide extra long battery life, published number is approx. 11 hours.\n\nThere is a slot on the tablet part of the device that will accept up to a 64 gig microSD card.  And, because we are talking Windows, you can store ANYTHING on the SD memory card...where Android only allows you to store pictures, music and videos on the external storage unless you root the device, and Apple Ipads don't even have an external slot!\n\nHowever, all is not perfect:  The screen resolution is below that of a comparable Android or Ipad tablet, but it is still 1366 x 768...not bad, but not even close to retina.  You would have to test the device and see if this is a problem for you, for me it was not a problem, in fact I'm generally at least 14-16 inches from the screen and at that distance, the screens on all these newer devices generally look the same.\n\nAlso, the touchpad is extremely sensitive and must be disabled if typing on the included keyboard for extended amount of time.  If I leave it on while typing, my thumbs will contact it while I'm using the spacebar, and the cursor will end up getting moved to another spot on my document.  Very annoying if you are a touch typist!  Disabling the touchpad is easy, just hit the fn key plus the f9 key to toggle the touchpad on or off.  If you would prefer a mouse over the touchpad, you may install a wired mouse (or wireless mouse with USB dongle) in the USB port, or you can purchase a stand alone bluetooth mouse which will interface very nicely with the built-in bluetooth.  Going this route will leave the single USB port free for other uses.  I have an old Kensington bluetooth mouse that I have tested and it works fine for this.  Or, you can simply reach up and touch the screen instead of using a mouse at all.  The touchpad should have been made a little smaller so that there could be more room between it and the spacebar.  It would still be usable.\n\nThe Bottom Line: I made this purchase after a lot of thought about the pros and cons of Ipad verses Android verses Windows.  I needed a machine that could do everything...be a \"PC with keyboard\" as well as a portable \"tablet\".  In my opinion, this device, even at $100 more than what I paid would serve those needs better than any other device currently available.  This is because of the included keyboard, flexibility with external devices thru the USB port, and micro SD slot for added storage.  Throw in the promise of full updates to the OS for the next 4 years and we have a winner in the longevity, flexibility, and usability categories.\n\nBy the way, this whole review was typed on my T100...I can't imagine doing this on any tablet that didn't have a keyboard...\n\nEdit to add the following info from a comment to my review from D.M.Cook:\n\nThe Micro SD slot will recognize a 64GB card. It may even do 128GB. They're a little pricey at this point, so I've not tested. Also, you can use the Micro USB charging port as a USB port with an OTG cable. With that, you can then connect any peripheral you want to the tablet itself (or, heck, connect a USB hub and connect multiple peripherals.)\n\n(I changed my review to reflect the ability to use 64GB card, but put the rest of his comments down here for ease of readability.\n -V.Lockwood)"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "This Asus tablet comes with two components: the 10.1-inch tablet itself, and the dock. The dock has a keyboard, a USB 3.0 SuperSpeed port and a built-in battery, so it's quite heavy, in fact almost as heavy as the tablet itself at a little over 1.2 pounds.  So together the tablet and the dock, which make the whole thing look like a portable DVD or Blu-ray player, weigh about 2.5 pounds, heavier than the Toshiba Z full-featured laptop with 13-inch, higher-resolution screen.  The tablet's battery is rated for 6 hours, and the dock's battery for 5 hours, for a total of 11 hours.  I haven't used the dock that much because it actually feels heavier than the 1.2 pound spec says!  On the tablet, the battery life does feel solid, close to the 6 hours rated, with WiFi turned on.\n\nI like the tablet itself a lot!  The only complaint I have is it lacks a central front Windows button, like the one you find on the Surface, the Toshiba Encore, the Lenovo Miix 2, etc.  Here the Windows button is situated on one of the shorter sides, and unmarked, so it's super-difficult to locate it unless you truly memorize its exact location. The button on my review unit, received from Vine is also half-broken as it takes two very hard presses to work each time, not pleasant.  Luckily, Windows 8.1 includes the Start icon which brings you back to the Start Screen with one tap.\n\nOtherwise the tablet is pretty good.  It weighs a  little over 1.2 pounds.  It has the latest energy-efficient Intel processor, and it works really fast.  The screen is beautiful and touch points responsive to my taps and scrolls and holds.  I don't have any problem using the touch screen.  My review unit comes with 32GB of storage, about 8 of which is taken by the hidden recovery partition, but apparently it's easy to copy this recovery partition to a USB drive and reclaim the storage for regular use.  I put in a 64GB micro-sd card to store files, although nowadays I store most of my files including music and video files on Skydrive, Microsoft's cloud-based storage.  I like Windows 8.1 added user-friendliness and flexibility.  I use the Asus mostly in tablet mode, but it does come with a full version of Microsoft Office that runs in Desktop mode.  All you have to do is use the included activation card to activate it via WiFi."}

I hear a sound \"Da-dunk\" and all I did was prop my screen at a slightly different angle, I know I've now disconnected the keyboard. Dang!

You can add the shortcut to your Metro interface for a one-touch Hibernate!\n\n*~*~*~*\n\nThe T100 is a great little Windows 8 transformer laptop/tablet with a few flaws. It fills in the void for those who need a reliable keyboard laptop but yearn for a tablet.\n\nThe T100 is equipped with a new generation Intel Atom Quad Core Processor with 2 GB of DDR3 RAM and a 64GB SSD. The sum of this  configuration greatly aids the T100 to deal effectively and efficiently with Windows 8 and its intensive graphic and touch features. My T100 operates just as well on Win8 as my Retina iPad does on iOS7!\n\nThe T100 has a bright, clear 10.1\" 1366 x 768 HD IPS multi-touch display. The touch function coupled with the snappy hardware delivers. There is barely any lag.\n\nThe tablet docks into the keyboard which houses a full size USB 3.0 port. The tablet has a micro-USB port which is the charging port but can also be used as a regular micro-USB port. It is also equipped with a micro-HDMI port, a micro-SD card slot and a 3.5mm headphone jack.\n\nThe T100 is primarily constructed of plastic composite and glass. It weighs 2.46 lbs - 1.26 lbs for the tablet and 1.2 lbs for the keyboard. The keyboard does seem a little heavier than it should be, especially since it does not house any batteries. The top of the keyboard including the wrist-rest and touch-pad areas could be aluminium and might explain the weight. The back of the tablet is smooth plastic while the back of the keyboard is rubberized.\n\nThe keyboard is smaller and in proportion to the size of the laptop. The keys are a little smaller but just as functional as any regular laptop. The keys do not feel like an add-on peripheral, they feel more like a built-in laptop keyboard.\n\nThe primary issues I have had with the laptop:\n1. The laptop is charged through the micro-USB port. This would not have necessarily been an issue but for the fact that, unlike conventional laptops, the T100 needs to acquire some (~10%) charge before it starts and is usable.\n2. The battery has been of a little concern. Starting with a 100% charge, the behavior has been inconsistent. At times, it will hold its charge in standby for 4-5 days with very little decay. Other days, it will be discharge in standby mode within a day. I have been playing around with settings in Win8 as it seems that the batteries have the potential to hold a charge for a long duration.\n3. The dock connection is a little flimsy. Even after the tablet has clicked into place, closing it over the keyboard seems to press against the dock release button and causes it to slip out of the dock. 9 out of 10 times I will pull it out of my case and the tablet would have partially slipped out of the dock.\n4. Though this might be more an Win8 issue, the touchpad seems to, at times, have a mind of its own.\n\nBonus Features:\n1. Microsoft Office 2013 Home/Student included - this is a very valued bonus.\n2. Unlimited ASUS cloud storage for 1 year.\n\nA definite Recommend.\n\nPros:\n* Good convertible laptop/tablet\n* Bright, clear 10.1\" 1366 x 768 HD IPS multi-touch display\n* Great hardware: New generation Intel Atom Quad Core Processor with 2 GB of DDR3 RAM and a 64GB SSD\n* Valuable ports: MicroSD, Micro HDMI & Micro USB\n* Well built keyboard\n* USB 3.0 port on keyboard\n* Up to 11 hrs battery life\n* Microsoft Office 2013 Home/Student included\n\nCons:\n* Unlike conventional laptops, the T100 needs to acquire some (~10%) charge before it starts and is usable\n* Keyboard is not backlit\n* Dock is a little flimsy, the dock release button seems to get activated when the tablet is closed over the keyboard\n* The dock design adds bulk to the laptop and is un-elegant"}

Since this device comes with both hardware AND software, my rating is based on the total product and not just the hardware."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I've been using the ASUS T100TA for about a month now, both as a tablet and as a laptop. I'm pretty impressed with the device overall, although it's not perfect. My main gripes are the keyboard and the operating system. The positives are the battery life, the bright and sharp screen, light weight, and snappy CPU.\n\nRegarding the keyboard, it's very close to full-size in the horizontal axis, but is only about 75% full-size in the vertical access. So touch typing is a little bit slow. I'm writing this review on the keyboard and it's not going very well. The trackpad is pretty good, but I would not plan to make this my primary computer for editing or creating content.\n\nWindows 8 is better than I expected as a tablet operating system. But as a desktop OS, speaking as a longtime user of Windows since 3.1, it sucks. You have to work hard to get to the standard desktop, and you can't even launch programs from its Start menu. But fortunately software can change and hopefully Microsoft makes improvements: But for now, please consider this a tablet purchase which can serve occasionally as a standard laptop.\n\nRegarding the positives: Although like the other reviewers say, it takes a long time to charge, at least the battery life is excellent. I can use it off and on for days no problem, and for hours in one sitting if I could spare that kind of time. So if you notice battery charge getting low, you'll probably be able to make it to the end of the day and then with an overnight charge you'll be good to go for the next day or several days.\n\nSince the device is made mostly of plastic, it's very lightweight. This means it's much easier to use as a tablet for long periods of time than, say, my iPad 2 which is quite a bit heavier. Of course, this means you have to care for it since it's probably not going to withstand being dropped on a tile or concrete floor.\n\nThe screen is really nice. Resolution is great for tablet apps. I like that it's widescreen, and Windows 8's horizontal scrolling mode takes great advantage of the screen real estate when you use it in landscape mode. When you use it that way, the Start button on the left side of the bezel is in just the right position for your left index finger.\n\nThe CPU is an Intel Atom. Don't let that alarm you--it's a new-generation chip that's way better than older Atom processors. I never notice any lag when using it as a tablet. I admit I have not tried to multitask desktop apps but since it's multicore, it will probably do okay.\n\nI think free disk space is fine. After installing a handful of apps that I like to use, plus a few Windows utilities I need, I still have 31 GB free which is plenty. And if you need more, say for taking your movie collection on the go with you, you can always use the micro SD card slot.\n\nI noticed initially that the battery would drain while the unit was on standby--turn off the screen in the morning with a full charge, battery gone by evening. But a Windows software update somewhere along the way seems to have solved that problem, and now I get days of standby no problem.\n\nIf you're not aware, multiple in-depth reviews are available for this device online, just search Google for \"ASUS T100 review.\" That is probably the best way to get to know this laptop before buying it. Same goes for Windows 8: If you want to know more about it, search for reviews online."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "As a tablet this is a very powerful and functional device, as a small notebook it is as powerful as any laptop.  Windows 8.1 takes a little getting used to but is excellent for the size of this computer. The graphics are phenomenal and provide crystal clear rendering.  I was also surprised by the processing speed which rivals my expensive laptop.  It is light and provides me an extra tool at work where I don't have the greatest workspace footprint.  All in all this earned a 5 star rating because I simply could not find anything I didn't like about it."}

When i heard asus was coming out with a full version of windows 8 with a keyboard dock for only $379 i was skeptical and didn't know what to say. The new intel baytrail atom with a quad core processor is amazing on this laptop not only for gaming but a great mini netbook/tablet that is great for the price and great for school work, oh and did i forget to mention it comes pre-installed with Microsoft home and student 2013 for free!!!!! Anyone person looking for a great windows 8 tablet should definitely grab this one, compared to other tablets in its class its a steal, i welcome anyone to find a better deal or product than this. Most 10.1 inch windows 8 tablets i seen don't even come with the keybord dock for this price of $379 either you have to pay for it separately which varies from $80 to upwards of $150, one thing i don't like is the charging port wich is a regular usb charge and it takes a while to charge, but the good thing is that it lasts up to 11 hours on a single charge!!! Ive gotten between 9.5 to about 11 hours but all in all great product, keep up the great work Asus!!!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "***UPDATE  20 April 2015***\nI have been using this T100 for over a year now, and I am still satisfied with it.  There have been a few issues with it along the way, but they have all been resolved.  Most of the issues were with the BIOS, and ASUS has been good about releasing updates in a timely manner to correct the problems.  First, I had a problem with the battery dying extremely fast, I am talking about only 3 hours of battery and that is even with it in standby.  The battery would die so fast that every time I was finished with it, I would turn it off instead of going into sleep mode.  ASUS was aware of the issue though, and they released a BIOS update that has fixed it.  Now the battery will last for about 6 to 7 hours while using it, and up to 2 days with it in sleep.  It will also last longer with the keyboard disconnected.  The second issue I was having was that the WiFi would constantly come up saying that the connection was limited and the only way to get it to reconnect properly was to tell Windows to trouble shoot the connection.  Windows would then reset the adapter and it would connect like it should.  If I tried to just turn the WiFi adapter off manually, it would hang up or it would not turn back on until I rebooted.  This was fixed though with a BIOS update from ASUS along with a Driver update for the adapter.  Now I have no problems with my connection.  The third issue was with the home button.  Some times it would work and other times it would not.  This got really annoying, especially when using it as a tablet.  ASUS was on it again and put out a BIOS update that resolved this issue also.  The last issue I had was actually my fault and nothing to do with ASUS at all.  I was carrying the T100 in my case and had it slung over my shoulder, then I dropped something on the ground and went to pick it up and the case slid off my shoulder and hit the ground.  I took the T100 out of the case to inspect it and the shell had split open and the Power and Volume buttons had gotten broke.  I was able to fix it though for pretty cheap, just by searching eBay for the part.  I found a seller that from what I can tell, bought T100s just to take them apart and sell the parts individually.  They had the PCB for the power and volume buttons on sale for $15 so I purchased one.  It was easy to install, just had to carefully pop the tabs around the outside of the shell and pull the back off.  Then unscrew the PCB from the housing and remove the ribbon cable.  Installed the new PCB and plugged everything else back up, and put it back together.  It has been working great ever since.  I can understand all the issues that the T100 had in the beginning, since it was a new product on the market, there will always be issues that pop up that weren't found during the trial stage, no matter how long they test the product.  In the open market, all of the individual units are used in different aspects depending on the user, and that is impossible to simulate during the trial stages prior to the RTM (Release to Market) stage.  The one thing that makes these issues a minor annoyance is the manufactures timely correction of them.  ASUS was very quick at getting the updates out there to correct every issue that the users came across.  I have been extremely satisfied with this T100, and I carry it with me everyday.  I have suggested it to a few of my friends and coworkers, and the ones that have purchased one, have told me that they are extremely happy with it.  The new models of the T100 don't have all the issues that this model had, so if you purchase one, it will be good to go right out of the box.\n\nI picked up the new ASUS T100 Transformer Book a few weeks back (13 November 2013), it was kind of an early Christmas present from my wife.  It is basically a small (10.1 inch) netbook, with a detachable touch screen.  It runs a full version of Windows 8.1, not the limited RT version.  This means that you can install programs on it just like you would any other Windows computer, while still allowing you use the apps from the Windows Store.  With Windows 8.1 RT you are limited to installing only the apps that are found in the Windows Store.  The processor is a 64 bit CPU but the OS is 32 bit.  You are able to purchase an upgrade if you would like.  You can also upgrade up to the Professional edition of Windows, which I plan to do in the near future, if you need the extra benefits of Pro like Group Policies and using the Metro apps through a proxy.  The T100 is a pretty effective little machine for travel, at home usage, and for me to use at work to access the corporate server and email.  I wouldn't use it as my primary computer though, as it doesn't have enough Processing Power to run all of my networking and diagnostics software, or the graphics to run Skyrim or similar games.  It does however have enough power to make it the perfect little machine for using on the road and when I make service calls to a residence.  Since it comes with a free full version of Microsoft Office Home and Student, it is great for students in high school or college that need a light computer to type up papers and spreadsheets, and with Microsoft Office auto upload, it loads the documents to the Skydrive cloud so they can access them from any computer, if they leave theirs at home.\n\nIt runs on a Quad Core Intel Atom Z3740 Processor (1.33 GHz) and 2 GB of RAM.  There are two models, one with a 32 GB eMMC Solid State Drive, and the one I purchased with a 64 GB eMMC SSD.  I opted for the 64 GB version because after you set everything up, and install the free Microsoft Home and Student Office Package, you use up a lot of storage space leaving only about 23 GB free for your programs and files.  Due to the formula for establishing data storage space, and the difference in what manufactures use for storage computations (a GB is 1,024 MB or 1,073,741,824 bytes in Binary or Computer Language and is 1,000 MB or 1,000,000,000 bytes in decimal which is what manufactures use) so you automatically lose close to 10% of you drive space after formatting leaving just over 58 GB out of 64.  Then there is also a loss of space due to the partition creation for the restore partition, leaving you a total of 49.1 GB of actual useable storage.  So I opted to get the 64 GB for $50 USD more.  I also got a 64 GB UHC 1 Class 10 Micro SD card to use for my Skydrive and file storage, so that I can maximize the amount of space used for programs.  You can mount the SD card to an empty folder on the primary partition so that the computer uses it as if it was part of the drive, sort of like running a RAID 0 Extended but it isn't as fluid and without the hardware for the RAID.  This provided sufficient storage, though I could have probably just went with the SSD include with the T100.  It also comes with 1 year free of unlimited (though I have been told that it maxes out at 1Terabyte) online storage through ASUS WebStorage.  I have Skydrive, and a personal cloud network on my home server so I don't use it very often, but for someone that needs online storage it is a good deal.\n\nThe screen has a remarkable resolution, though it is not 1080p only 1366x768, but with the 10.1 IPS screen you cant really tell the difference in resolution unless you have super human vision.  I have watched a few HD movies on it while on the road, and the play back quality is crisp and clear.  The touch screen is extremely responsive and can recognize up to five different points at once allowing for multiple levels of gestures to be used.  At first I thought that with the size of the screen, when using the Desktop, that it would be hard to use the touch screen to navigate through Windows Explorer with my finger, but after a day or two I found it to be quite easy actually.  The screen is a magnet for fingerprints though, as is the back of it, but it cleans off really easily with a microfiber cloth.  With the detachable screen, it works great for a netbook, or a tablet.  The Windows 8 Metro apps are great for touchscreens.\n\nThe screen houses the Micro SD card slot, a Micro USB port for charging that can also be used for USB devices with an adapter, a Micro HDMI port for viewing on a larger monitor or TV, a 1.2 MP webcam, microphone, two speakers, and a light sensor.  The Micro USB and HDMI ports are pretty close, but you can plug the charger and the Micro HDMI cable in at the same time, but not with a Micro HDMI adapter.  The first hardware versions had a Windows button in the bottom center of the bezel, but in the recent versions it has been moved to the left side below the volume button.  The webcam is decent for doing Skype or any other video chat and the mic picks up really well with minimal background noise.  With the light sensor the camera will automatically adjust the white balance to get optimum video capture.  The light sensor also works for adjusting the screen brightness too.  The speakers are really good for integrated ones.  They use SonicMaster technology developed by ASUS to give really exceptional sound for such small speakers, making watching movies and listening to music a joy.\n\nThe keyboard attachment is a full QWERTY keyboard with Function and Windows keys.  It also house a USB 3.0 port, and a touch mouse with gesture functions and click buttons.  The keys are a little small to my liking and a bit close together.  At first it was a bit of a hassle to type on it especially since the right Shift is half the size of the left, but after a while using it I have gotten used to it and am pretty efficient with it now.  The keys are not back lit either so it may be hard for those that are not typists to use in the dark.  The keyboard includes all the standard keys that you would find on a full size Windows keyboard other than the numerical pad, so it is a decent compromise with the small tightly spaced keys.\n\nAfter testing this out for over a month now (Purchased on November 17th), and the battery life is exceptional.  On average, I can go for 2 days without putting it on the charge once I fully charge it.  It is a 31WHr battery that uses either 120v or 240v input at 2.1 Amps for charging.  It takes a while to fully charge though, due to the size of the battery and the charge rate, roughly around 8 hours.  You will have to use the charge block that comes with it or a comparable one that has around 2 Amp output, or it could take you a full day to completely charge it.  It uses a micro USB cable to charge, the one that comes with it is extremely short when comparing it to standard notebook charge cables.  I purchased a 6 Ft one to use with it to give me the extra length to be able to use the T100 while I was charging it.  To save on battery also I turn it completely off instead of putting it to sleep if I am not going to be using it for a few hours.  With the lightning fast start up of the T100, at roughly 8 seconds, it doesnt slow me down at all.\n\nFor connectivity, it has Wireless N Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Version 4.  There is no Ethernet port, but if you need one, you can always get a USB Ethernet adapter.  The Wireless N is really fast, up to 300 mbps, with the compatible router, and it can broadcast a Wi-Fi signal if you use USB to tether your phone to your computer and want to share your internet with others around you.  You will have to know how to use Command to allow the Hosted Network, but it aint real hard, just a few lines, then allowing others to connect through your connection, and you are done.  The Bluetooth is version 4 which is backward compatible with all other Bluetooth connections and with the new revisions, the Bluetooth will automatically shut off and turn on when need, if it is left on.  I use the Bluetooth to connect to my phone to import my pictures and videos, and it transfers fairly quickly.\n\nOverall I am extremely satisfied with the T100.  I have already recommended it to a few people, who have purchased one for themselves.  As with anything there are pros and cons, but for me the pros extremely outweigh the cons.  Others that I know that have the T100 have said the same.  So if you are looking for a tablet, but also need a computer and don't want to spend the cash on both, this would be a good choice for you."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I need to lead with the negative. With my T100 the Broadcom wireless drivers that Windows update suggested I update to through Windows update Borked the tablet. It took me awhile to figure out that they were the problem as there were a fair number of other updates. In the end it took 7 restores, one refresh and lots of sleuthing (about 8hrs in total) to determine that it was the update to the Broadcom wireless drivers that kept destroying the windows install. The touch screen would lose operability, I'd get BSoD on reboot and sometimes it would just lock-up completely. I was able to restore each time, but after I left the drivers alone with no update, it has been working PERFECTLY since then. So my suggestion is, do NOT attempt to update the Broadcom wireless drivers THROUGH WINDOWS UPDATE.\n\nI say that because today I ran in to another Broadcom driver issue. The wireless adapter comes defaulted to 20mhz/65mbps mode. I enabled 40mhz/150mbps mode. It would keep losing an effective network connection after 3-5 minutes. After checking, Asus has newer Broadcom drivers on their website. I downloaded it and had to manually select the driver (no install package for them). The installed driver has a signed date of October, the Asus website says that the drivers on their site I think are November signed, after manually updating Windows claims that the drivers are older and from September (despite what Asus website claims). HOWEVER, the wireless adapter now works in 40mhz/150mbps mode without dropping the connection every few minutes (requiring a restart). Weirdly the network status claims it is only connected at 24mbps (I've verified 150Mbps connection speeds as SMB transfers from my file server chug along between 6-8.5MB/sec, about 67Mbps on the high end, compared to 3-5.5MB/sec in 20Mhz/65Mbps mode).\n\nSo the wireless in the tablet is bonkers. I think I blame mostly Broadcom on this one, but Asus should have also done better validation of the hardware they were installing in these tablets. Mine is a fairly early one, Warehouse deal from around 11/25, so it is probably some of the earliest hardware. It could be Asus changed to a different revision of the same Broadcom wireless adapter, or maybe better quality control.\n\nEither way, BEWARE when you are setting it up for the first time.\n\nSo the negative out of the way. After getting the wireless issues fixed, it has been problem free and working GREAT. Yes, it is only a 768p screen, but the quality is rather good. Decent viewing angles, decent saturation, bright enough and I don't notice significant glare (I'd rate it roughly on par, glare wise, as my iPad 2, but overall better DPI, almost as good viewing angles, better contrast and maybe slightly better saturation).\n\nThe atom processor in the tablet is overall pretty snappy and I don't find any real issues with the eMMC in the tablet for speed. The card slot seems limited to around 20-25MB/sec only, sadly, but it may be worth getting a fast micro SD card for it anyway, as you have better small file transfer performance, even if you can't get all of the sequential speed goodness (I got a 32GB Sandisk Extreme to go with the tablet on sale from Amazon. It hits ~80MB/sec reads and 55MB/sec writes through my desktop's USB 3.0 reader, but only around 25MB/sec read and writes in the T100, but small file performance is pretty close between the my USB3.0 card reader and the internal T100 card slot).\n\nThe dock is pretty good. I have average sized hands for a man 6'1\", so bigger than average for most men. I don't have any real problems typing on it. Sure, it is small, its a 10.1\" tablet dock. I wouldn't want to write a 20 page paper on it, but I can manage at least 80% of my typing speed that I can on my 14\" laptop or desktop's full sized keyboard. The key travel is nice, it isn't a loud keyboard. The trackpad is nicer than I was lead to believe. No, it isn't great, yes it is small. I don't really have any issues with it losing track and it generally registers clicks (90+% of the time).\n\nOverall, for the price the T100 is awesome. Sadly stock of it seems low right now with few having it, especially the 64GB model. I can't help wondering what Asus could have done with another $100 on the price tag. z3770 processor, 900 or 1080p screen and 3/4GB of RAM? Maybe slightly better build quality and better/faster wireless?\n\nMaybe next year.\n\nAt any rate, the T100 is well worth its price."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "Like other reviewers I was impressed when I first opened my new T100 which I have owned for almost 2 months now.  It seems to be pretty solid hardware, the screen is nice and nothing bad can be said for value of a touch screen tablet including docking keyboard, Microsoft Windows 8.1 and Office Home and Student at a great price.\n\nMy use of this is primarily for work - I needed something ultra-portable to take notes while on jobs (I am an independent Tech Support consultant), so having MS Word to manage my notes via Dropbox is the ticket.  The keyboard is a bit cramped but I am getting used to it and I prefer it over the touch screen keyboard by far. The touchpad is the device's hardware weak point - nothing a wireless USB mouse doesnt handle easily.  I am not a fan of Windows 8 but am still getting used to it.\n\nHowever, I just sent it back to the repair center at ASUS. There seems to be a battery drain issue on mine.  It did take a full overnight charge out of the box before I could use it. I was excited to fire it up and start customizing Windows 8, apps, etc.  I like to use it for an hour or so, and then put it into sleep mode so I can pick it up a few hours later and continue.  I used the Windows 8 power settings to choose sleep (as opposed to the function keys on the keyboard) and the next time I went to wake it up and use it the device simply did not wake up.  I thought something was funny so I continued to test this pattern of use the next several days and was consistently disappointed.  It seems it didn't sleep at all but instead stayed on and drained the battery quickly while not in use.  Sometimes I can hear the camera taking pictures while closed with the keyboard which surely must drain the battery.\nSo then I just started turning it off. Unfortunately, the battery drains overnight even after fully charged and turned off.  Strangely, if I leave it plugged in and charging overnight (fully charged) and then unplug it and use it right away, the battery seems to drain normally.  I can use it a full 6 to 8 hours before it drains down to 20-30%.  Because of this I thought maybe I was doing something wrong to power it off or put it to sleep.  So I worked with ASUS support tech that reviewed it all with me and had me do a hard power reset.  Then I tried it again for the next several days. Problem remains. Still loses charge if I don't use it for a day despite being fully charged and powered off. This is very disappointing as now I have to wait 3 to 4 weeks for service to get it, service and it and send it back.  So, to be continued, I guess"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "Update:\n\nBattery problems are now solved. I have disabled the automatic installation and downloading of Windows Updates (only leaved notifications of new updates) and tinkered a bit with the Keyboard power options in Device Manager (disabled the \"allow this device to wake up computer\" in Properties for the HID Keyboard). Applications that continuously listen for notifications may also play a role (try uninstalling Facebook temporarily). While this is not something that non-IT people knows how to do, it fixed my problems and now the tablet drains only 15% over 3 days, which is great.\n\nMy rating is now 5 stars for this combo. It's really great !\n\nAfter buying a Dell Venue 8 Pro for myself, I also bought an Asus T100 for a close member of my family and I can use it any time I want. I know many people are cross-shopping these two tablets.\n\nBuild quality is significantly higher on the Dell Venue 8 Pro, but the Asus T100 feels very good too, especially for the price. The T100 screen glass feels like plastic instead of glass initially, the screen surface feels hard to glide figers on. But it becomes useable after some time, after some finger grease settles on it. I think it is missing some special coating specific to high-quality touch screens.\n\nThe screen viewing angles are nothing short of amazing. Crisp text and basically no color distortion at any angle. Very good screen, even if not extremely bright. It also enters a \"reading mode\" when you launch a PDF file or in other (not sure which) conditions. The screen colors get warmer in that mode.\n\nUnfortunately, the T100 has some significant shortcomings (besides its obvious advantages like a large screen and free keyboard dock): battery drains much faster at idle/sleep, even after flashing the latest 220 BIOS and the latest Windows and Asus updates as of 12/28/2013. This happens especially when docked to the keyboard. While the Dell Venue 8 Pro can stay in connected stand-by for like 5-7 days, the Asus T100 drains in 24 hours if docked or ~2 days if removed from dock. It also drains faster with usage. Don't get me wrong, the battery life with use is very good, it can be like 7-10 hours. But overall something is wrong with the T100 battery life at this time, hopefully it's fixable via some updates, but I am afraid it may have something to do with hardware too. It's not easy or cheap to implement connected stand-by with low battery usage. The charging time is quite slow too, making you keep the laptop with the charger connected most of the time.\n\nKeyboard on the T100 feels very good, keys are a tiny bit smaller than on the previous \"netbooks\" but insigificantly so. You get used to them and become productive in 1-2 days. Much better than a touch screen keyboard. Trackpad is as good as any notebook trackpad but only after you uninstall the Asus SmartGestures software and flash the 220 BIOS.\n\nThe Asus T100 docking mechanism is very good and stable, with one shortcoming of a too narrow maximum screen tilting angle. Sometimes you wish you could tilt the screen more.\n\nAll in all, if the T100 fixes its battery and stand-by problems it's a near perfect convertible tablet/laptop. But right now I cannot fully recommend it because it is not mobile enough due to the battery draining issues. Instead I would recommend the Venue 8 Pro with the official wireless keyboard case (unless you absolutely need a larger screen)."}

I carry some heavy legal books to and from class and the library, so I'm really happy that the Asus weighs so very little. It came with Microsoft Office already installed (Yay!) and much to my surprise I like the functionality of the tiled Windows home screen. I have also been very satisfied with the battery life, having no need to bring an adapter to class or the exam room. Like many of the other reviewers, I too find the keyboard to be on the small side. It took me some time to adjust to the smaller than usual shift key on the right. Now that I have adjusted I find myself having to readjust when I use a full-sized keyboard. So, there is really no design flaw with the keyboard, it's just a matter of what our fingers are used to. You can also save files directly to SkyDrive, which really frees up space on the hard drive and allows one to freely access files across many devices. In summary, the Asus has given me a lot of bang for my buck. I have been quite satisfied.\n\nWhat I generally use the laptop for:\n1) notetaking\n2) exams\n3) writing papers\n4) Netflix\n5) internet apps\n6) Kindle books"}

The ASUS Transformer Book is a fantastic idea as it works like laptop, but can be disconnected from the keyboard for a more portal device, if needed. I use it 95% of the time with the keyboard attached, but I love being able to disconnect it and lean back on the couch with it, or give it to my daughter while we're in the car so she can watch Netflix... very convenient.\n\nBattery life is excellent... I plug it in at night to charge and haven't run out of power anytime during the day yet.\n\nOnly complaint would be Windows... I've been using Windows since version 1.0, and although there's been a few versions that weren't very impressive, Windows 8 is the first time Microsoft came out with an OS that I actually don't like... 'loath' would probably a better description. With is a truly awful operating system. This is my first time using Windows 8 on a touchscreen, and although it's better suited here then on a desktop or non-touchscreen laptop, it's still an absolutely horrible OS. Here, basically you're using a tablet/laptop with an OS that's dumbed down to make it feel like a mobile phone. I would love to see Android installed instead, or better yet, Windows 7...\n\nThis is far from my first Asus product... all my desktop computers in my home are built on Asus motherboards and have been for years. I also use Asus monitors exclusively, so Asus quality is no surprise to me and the Transformer Book is exactly what I would expect from them.\n\nOverall, despite it's awful operating system, this is a great computer with a fantastic way of getting the best of both a laptop and a tablet. Highly recommended..."}

I would have hated to purchase a tablet to be honest because this transformer book has a desktop. It is like a tablet but it has Microsoft :D.\nIt is light and very portable. 11 hours of usage, that is amazing. Watched 4 movies and it can still go!\n\nThis is where the -1 star comes in.\nWell I'd say the only down side is the keyboard can get detached when you pick up the transformer, but if you put it in correctly, it shouldn't detach so easily. You don't need the keyboard because the screen has a keyboard, but its faster to type on a keyboard.\n\nUPDATE: It isn't worth the buy anymore.\n-Going from a 4 star to a 2 star.\n-They do have really good customer service, their products LACK.\n-Still with the Keyboard issue, maybe it is supposed to be like that?\n-Windows issue?

I have owned android tablets before so that is my comparison.  Windows 8 is amazing because it does neat tablet stuff while allowing me to do work using MS Office just like it was a notebook.  There are not as many apps yet, but the ones on Windows are amazing.  My favorite is the all in one shopping app. The PC/tablet/notebook hooked up to my wireless printer without even needing to be set up.  The device comes with over a terabyte of cloud storage for all of your photos and music so virtually nothing goes on the tablet aside from what you want to keep there.  You can access the information from any PC or phone also.  Internet is very smooth and fast using both Internet Explorer and Chrome. Syncing your contacts is a snap, just setup a Hotmail account and import your contacts from Gmail or wherever.. I installed MS Office 13 Professional and it runs just as fast as my desktop.  Battery life is amazing. I can't think of a complaint and I typed this with my on screen keyboard! Waiting for apps to be developed doesn't bother me when I can access everything on full websites just like a PC... because it is a PC... When you want a cozy tablet to read wherever, you have it.  If you need the power of a laptop PC, you have that too. I am considering a Windows phone when I upgrade next time... not sure, android does well on a phone, but Microsoft owns the PC and I think now the tablet, as far as I am concerned anyway.\n\nAdded 12/29/13\n\nAll set up now and it works flawlessly as a tablet and laptop.  Kudos to ASUS on design!  My only warning is that the laptop is top-heavy unlike previous generation laptops since all of the hardware is on top, so be careful not to let it tip!  I tried a wireless mouse on the tablet and it worked flawlessly.  I purchased a netbook sleeve to protect the device on trips since it is similar in size.  Also, I forgot to mention how cool it is that this device uses the same charger as my phone to charge, which means I can use my backup battery pack to charge it too just like my phone.  Amazing. Thanks ASUS, Microsoft, and Amazon!\n\nOne more thing too, it is so nice to have extremely long battery life and no moving parts.  The tablet does not heat up at all, unlike laptops of the past."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I bought this device simply because I needed a frugal, practical schoolwork machine that could also do internet things. I love that it comes with Microsoft office ready for download, and the keyboard (though somewhat cramped) is solid and part of the foundation of the computer, unlike the Microsoft Surface's keyboard, which is like a manila folder with buttons.\n\nThe transformer feels much more like a laptop. It's solid. It's a tablet at its core, but the whole hybrid concept is so well integrated that you forget that fact while you're using it. You won't be able to play games, do high definition stuff or any of that fancy stuff, but if you're really expecting that from a $400 tablet hybrid, lower your expectations a bit. This a plucky little tablet computer that does exactly what it sets out to do and nothing more.\n\nSome small little niggles include a small keyboard, a multi-touch pad that seems a bit unrefined, and a few bugs that were quickly fixed and mostly Microsoft's fault. If you happen to get one of these computers, do not allow Microsoft to update it automatically! They updated my network adapter without telling me and broke it.\n\nOutside of that, though, this is a plucky, enthusiastic little laptop that has no delusions of grandeur and will provide you with exactly what you need on a budget."}

Probably from being held and a button being pressed\n\nAll in all, this runs games, productivity software, and all with minimal lag. It's a wonderful companion and has replaced my laptop. Of course, I still have a desktop, and this will never replace that. The idea here is to have the most portable device to share movies the family, play a few simple games on the go or on break, and do work when the time comes.

This means I don't have a ton of extra cash sitting around to spend on frills like a metal case for my tablet, or an iPad that doesn't run MS Office. I'm graduating soon, so having something that can help me with taking notes now and typing documents later is a major boon to my productivity.\nComparing all of the available options, this is the best bang for the buck on paper:\nFull Windows 8.1\nMS Office Suite\nKeyboard attachment\nThe only two comparable Microsoft options are the Surface 2 RT, and the Surface Pro 2; the RT doesn't run a full version of Windows (which is helpful for plug-ins like Microsoft Silverlight for those of you who like to run programs with it) and the Pro 2 requires you to purchase Office and the keyboard for extra, making it nearly 3 times as expensive as this offering from Asus.\n\nThis has a beautiful screen, and I've run several games and movies during my few months with the device with no noticeable issues. The touch screen is responsive, and the 2 gb of RAM make doing most normal daily tasks a breeze. When surfing through pages with a ton of pictures (i.e. scrolling down through Groupon Goods), it may get bogged down; but that happens on an extremely rare circumstance. Most games are zippy enough, although I don't play high intensity games that might give this computer a problem. I was worried about the multi-tasking power of the processor which I had never heard of before, but as far as I can tell it works as well as I can hope for.\n\nBut: You get what you pay for. Mostly.\n\nI'm mostly satisfied with the machine. But there are some kinks in the actual operation that are irksome. I've had issues with the keyboard docking after installing drivers for a USB mouse; having to restart the computer because of unresponsive controls; the trackpad starts up after wiggling the cursor around for a few moments; and figuring out that it won't charge unless it has an A/C adapter that puts out at least 2.1 amps were each a separate minor heart attack. But I built my own desktop computer earlier this year, so I have no problem with finding answers from forums to the various problems I have had.\n\nHowever! I would not recommend this to the technologically insecure. If you have no desire to fix your own computer problems, pony up for the Surface 2 RT (or other comparable tablet/hybrid). If you're willing to give your brain a workout, and be happy with your decision to pay approximately half of what you might pay elsewhere, click the buy-now button.\n\nPros:\nCost (!)\nInclusion of keyboard and necessary software\nEasy transition to Windows 8\nSound is loud [for a tablet]\nPicture quality is great\n\nCons:\nBuggy\nMultiple issues with software/hardware integration\nBuild quality for the keyboard feels flimsy\nFinding a suitable case is a chore"}

Finally, after several attempts, the machine rebooted and I immediately restored the factory default settings, updated windows, and DISABLED all ASUS updates. I've never updated the BIOS, nor will I take such a risk.\n\nI have been using the machine for 5-6 hours on weekdays and even took it on a 2-week trip to Mexico. It has been working smoothly since that initial crash more than a month ago and I'm very pleased it. It's very light to carry around, the battery lasts more than 10 hours after a complete charge (which takes only 3-4 hours), the screen is clear and sharp, and it has free Office 2013. While it takes a few hours to work comfortably with Windows 8.1, I like it a lot since it seamlessly integrates the desktop with the tablet experience. This machine is a very good buy at less than $400.\n\nI give this 4 instead of 5 stars because a computer should not crash right out of the box. In my many years of buying computers, this was the first time that it happened and I was so frustrated that I almost returned it. ASUS needs to improve their quality control system."}

Long battery life, 2. Full version of Windows 8.1, 3. MS Office, 4. Low Price. and 5. Latest and Fast Intel Processor.\nI did follow these suggestions from one user.\n1. Plug in and charge for at least one hour before turning the device on. And keep it plugged throughout the initial set up.\n2. Update the Bios.  (I did not know how to do this so I skipped this part). (See update below.)\n3. On initial setup, select customize and turn off \"Update Windows Automatically\".

I can be fully charged in the morning and be at less than 50% at the end of the day with little to no use.  I checked some user forums and other users who experienced the same problem recommended updating the bios. However, I couldn't find any simple step-by-step instructions. I was able to figure this out from the forums as follows:\n1. Go to [...] Select \"Download Now\" for drivers, bios, etc.\n2. Select Model Manually. Select \"Notebook\" under Product. Select \"T100 Series\". (Do not select \"Eee\")\n3. Select \"T100TA\" and \"Windows 8.1 32bit\"\n4. Select \"Bios Utilities\" and download Windows BIOS Flash Utility onto your Asus T100. This will show up as \"WinFlash\" in your applications.  You will use this app to install the BIOS update.\n5. Go to BIOS and download \"BIOS 220\".  This is the latest version. This can be done on the Asus or a desktop PC.  It will be a zip file, so you'll need to unzip it before installation. If it is on your desktop, unzip it and then save it to a flash drive.\nIf it is on your Asus, you'll need to install a program to unzip the BIOS file.\n6. Open WinFlash and select the location where you saved the unzipped BIOS 220 file.\n7. Follow the on screen instructions to update the BIOS.\n\nAfter updating the BIOS, the battery drain improved significantly by only decreasing about 10% after 12 hours versus 50% before the BIOS update. Still not as good as an iPad, which may only decrease 3% to 4%, but a big improvement compared to before."}

After windows automatically upgraded the device would not reboot. The system would make it as far as the ASUS screen with the little circle of dots which would then freeze. After rebooting to the recovery menu (hit F9 as soon as the screen flashes when powered on) I tried several repair, restore and complete windows re-installs to no avail. I found the latest bios file on the ASUS support site and extracted the file to a thumbdrive. The Transformer recognized the thumbdrive immediately so I was able to use Advanced Options in recovery to update the bios. After updating the bios I did a complete system restore and even after installing all of the Windows 8.1 updates everything appears to be working normally.\n\nConclusion: I give ASUS 1 stars for launching a product with such a buggy bios. The product itself is great when it works with a nice compact size but keyboard big enough to be useful even to someone with big hands.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "This is an incredible value for the money and, over the month I have owned this, I have been very impressed. If Microsoft had produced this tablet when Windows 8 launched I'm sure it would have been much more successful.\n\nThe screen is not particularly high resolution but it is very clear, bright and has good color. I use my tablet for watch a lot of movies while traveling and it is great for that. The keyboard is excellent with good feel and travel on the keys and it is surprisingly comfortable to use considering the size. The trackpad is small but functional - although clicking seems to be limited to certain areas - it's not a highlight of the device. The way the tablet connects to the keyboard is excellent. It seems very sturdy and, when docked, it behaves just like a laptop. It is also easy to dock or undock.\n\nThe performance has exceeded my expectations and it seems quite snappy as long as you do not open too many applications at once. My Windows Experience Index score is 4.1 which is not bad considering the 2 GB of RAM and Atom processor.\n\nThere are three things I would change if I were designing this. I would offer a version with 128 GB of internal storage as 64 GB is not much once Windows has taken its share (which will only grow as updates get installed). The other strange thing to me is that there is a metal plate in the keyboard to provide the weight to keep the tablet from tipping backward when docked. Surely it would not have added too much to the cost to add a battery as the extra weight and extend the usage time of the system. At the moment I get 7 hours of continuous HD movie playback at full screen brightness, with speaker output and wireless etc. all turned on. I expect this can easily be extended to 8 hours with power optimizations but another battery in the keyboard, instead of dead weight, would have been useful. It should also have a GPS receiver built in.\n\nDespite these minor shortcomings I find that I can take this on trips and it is able to replace my laptop and its charger (for real work), an Android tablet (for watching movies on flights and listening to music while driving), and my TomTom (by using an external GPS receiver). When you want to travel light this device saves an awful lot of space and weight."}

It's pretty great in terms of the former and more than adequate of the latter and whilst it cannot match an ipad as a content consumption device or ios as a tablet OS, the flexibility and versatility offfered by a full Windows tablet PC is simply miles ahead of anything else on the market right now.\n\nBay Trail is very fast and even running a quite resource demanding, specialised software through remote desktop doesn't seem to be too much of an ask even whislt also multitasking with a number of other things, e.g mail, music, live tv app etc.\n\nBuild quality is fine and the keyboard, for me at least, very comfortable and ideal for some quick work whilst travelling.\n\nThe app selection in the Metro UI is OK and I have found pretty much a replacement for everything I use in my Android phone with a few exceptions of local and specialised apps. A HUGE plus point for me is the fully flash enabled browser as I watch a lot of sports on live streaming and after jelly bean most of these sites would not run properly on android - as obviously not on ios either from day one - without some finicky sideloading and even then it would not be 100% reliable.\n\nThe screen is not full HD but you can certainly live with this resolution.  Battery - WOW!!! 11-12 hours easily with moderate to heavy use and the T100 stays true to the advertised battery duration, something very rare nowadays.\n\nConnectivity - well, full is probably a simple way to describe it and although a couple more full USB ports in the dock would have been great, the fact that it has one with all the benefits that carries is another major plus of this great device.\n\nCons? it is a fingerprint magnet, both on the screen and the tablet's back but I consider this a completely minor detail considering everything else and nothing a few swipes with a cloth (I use the typical ones provided with sunglasses) won't fix, for a little while at least.\n\nFor me the major con was what happened to quite a few, as it seems, early adopters with the windows and/or asus updates crashing the T100. A lot of it apparently had to do with the update of Windows 8.0 to 8.1 and as soon as it started to roll out with 8.1 out of the box, like mine, the problems have been eradicated to a large extent if you judge by the reviews.\n\nHere in Greece I haven't read of one single complaint in the relevant forum and the device was only available from one retailer and all were shipped with 8.1.\n\nNetbooks were a great idea but so poorly implemented in most cases. This is such a great netbook, functional, portable and powerful that I would have been quite happy with my purchase even its tablet use was not of the same standard. But, it actually is making this a proper hybrid tablet/netbook.\n\nA brilliant device and a great buy at a trully honest price which becomes even more remarkable when you account for the free Office licence."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "Just what I EXPECTED! A nice hybrid laptop-tablet at a nice Price!\n\nThen like November I discover the ASUS Transformer Book T100TA-C1-GR 10.1-Inch Detachable 2-in-1 Touchscreen, It was interesting first at all by the price and things comes with in.\nAfter investigating and read a lot of reviews and reports I thought this really going to be the table I going to buy, and I did it!\nGet started!\nIsn't perfect. My came with four dead keyboard letters from the fabric (both alt's keys, '''' and key were suppose is it (I'm a Latino speaker) f9 and f3 both also dead). But fortunately aren't necessary keys.\nMy worst fear was that I read that the BIOS could get crash when I update the system. Fortunately didn't happened. (Two weeks and hopes it won't happened ever.)\n\nTHE GOOD:\nA nice combo convertible laptop-tablet with decent characteristics inside at a reasonable price. Brought it when the price was the lowest! 349 to low.\nComes with keyboard with in the price. Its not that amazing keyboard, but works and helps. Better than nothing!! Right now I'm writing this review with this transformer book keyboard.\nLattes Intel atom Quad core inside, let me play 1080p movies, some hi-res games, and other middle range multiple tasks easily with no notice.\nMostly OUT-IN Ports needed in daily life. Micro-sd, audio in-out jack, Micro USB-charger-port, Micro HDM. Crispy but only one 3.0 USB Port.\nOriginal full windows 8.1 (isn't pro but do the work) with full Office Home ed. 2013.\nKind of loud stereo speakers, not that high but lit higher considering its a tablet.\nA 10 hours average battery life. Gets awake with me all day.\nLight and very slim.\nRocker keys.\nBluetooth 4.0 and wireless N.\n\nThe Bad: fortunately are minor things.\n\nThis weird keys board. The size doesn't bother me, it is the location strangely keys positioned! (Weird short right shift key and FN KEY get me writing errors)  NO ESCUSES ASUS! I already have a 10'' laptop and it keyboard (standard) is quite good. Yes, I get used to, but the experience could be better, please. And why only one USB port? I have to make miracles with it. Other side came with four letter keys dead (already say it).\nSleepy touchpad.\n8 hours charging for get 10-11 hour of operating battery life. You must be start to think charge this thing when you are sleeping or you won't get full battery experience.\nThis short USB charger multiple use-cable. Is only like 2 feet I think. It won't let me charge far away from an outlet!\nFinger prints everywhere!!!\nOnly one camera. No rear.\nNo full HD resolution screen, decent quality. Sunlight reflector, but brilliant enough and good for price.\nSome reviews said Bios get crash! My DOESN'T (that is very good, thanks god).\nNot for massive storage. With all necessary programs still left only 25 GB. So is more recommended this version rather the 32 GB version. You must start thinking put all you massive data on some wireless external HD perhaps.\n\nLast words:\nAs already said it. Is not perfect, but for the price you get a good entry-level laptop with good adds. Some things have to be improve but in generally it really good comparing with other laptops convertibles equal range (this got better processor and cost less considering comes with keyboard). Hopefully I will do an update review next time and I hope things won't get a change. Hope this review help you people."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "This was just what I was looking for. Small, light and with a VERY long battery life. I could watch 4-5 hours of movies on the plane and still have plenty of battery left. The dock connection between tablet and keyboard is solid and I am not afraid that it will be damaged when you pick it up by either part. Keyboard should have been made with a little bit heavier plastic or aluminum. It's not bad but has a little bit of flex to it. It is a budget combo so it is not perfect. For the price it is very good. Some people complained about the size of the bezel around the screen, I find it helpful to hold the tablet without fear of falling out of my hands. Surface of the screen and the back of the tablet is a major fingerprint magnet. As one other reviewer said Asus needs to talk to the guys who made kindle and make theirs too. Hopefully ASUS will work on their sleep mode because it does use too much battery (about 5-10% per day) comparing to my Mack and Kindle. I did update computer and windows software. Not a huge drawback but something to improve on. Keyboard works well even with my large \"sausage\" fingers. I mean it's not a full size but beats trying to type on the screen or one of those fake keyboard.  I bought couple mini SD cards for extra storage. Comes wit about 35GB free space on the main drive after all updates. I just find it easier to keep my music and TV programs on an SD card. Software has some glitches but, Hey it's Windows, wouldn't expect any different. No issues with blue screens, no starts and such seems to work well for the last month or so. It is stupid that IE acts different and opens in a different screen when opened from the desktop screen and from the windows 8 \"app\" screen. That should be integrated and go to the same place. All in all it works well, has a almost full windows office minus outlook (too bad Microsoft is not making enough from office to include outlook with it ). I would have given it 4.5 stars for a few minor things but overall it is a good buy."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "Like so many others, I bought this device because it was reasonably priced when compared with Surface tablets sold directly from Microsoft or other vendors.  I also liked that it came with a keyboard already, which is a $150 savings.\n\nWhen it arrived, it looked just like it did in the pictures, which was comforting.  I didn't initially have any issues with the device when I first started to use it.  It turned on just fine; it moved in a snappy fashion; and the screen resolution was great for my needs.  However, after two days, I noticed several technical issues.  The device would randomly reboot.  Sometimes it wouldn't even turn on.  One of the keys on the keyboard became loose and nearly came off.  It seemed like the device and keyboard were hurriedly put together to get to the market.  I wasn't thrilled about this at all.\n\nNaturally, I returned it and purchased something else rather than giving another Transformer a try.  Time is of the essence, and I didn't want to run the risk of getting another defective unit because it's a Transformer problem rather than a one-off event.\n\nIf you're in the market for a reasonably priced tablet, I suppose you can consider this one.  However, if you have the extra money, I would spend more to get something with a little better quality."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I got the T100 to use as a (relatively) inexpensive, lightweight travel machine to take on motorcycle road trips, a job that used to be done by an old, faithful but now dead Aldi Akoya netbook. So the smallish keyboard that is sometimes a topic for complaint with the T100 is not a problem for me, since it's really just the same as what I was using before. It's also really not that fragile - some of the reviews I'd read had lead me to expect something that felt like a piece of cardboard. But honestly, it's fine. It's not as if it's a load bearing structure in your house or something...\n\nIt doesn't have to work that hard. Mail, the odd document, social media and download video clips off the GoPro. So why not an iPad or cheap Android tab? Simple - if you want to run specialized windows applications (in my case engine ECU flash and GPS mapping software) then you're really only left with one choice for a new touch device, and that's something that runs full Windows 8.1. The T100 handles all of this flawlessly. Apart from the Windows 8 learning curve, there's nothing I've yet found that I don't like about this one. Yes the 64GB internal storage that comes with it is a bit on the small side, but I didn't get the T100 to be my primary storage device. The 64GB MicroSD that I bought to go with it gives me plenty enough for a few days worth of GoPro clips, and there's always USB flash drives if even that runs out of space.\n\nBattery life is fantastic. It'll go all day with light to moderate usage. One thing to note though - if it's asleep in a bag and gets bumped around a bit (common on the excuses that pass for rural roads in Australia) it can open to the point it wakes itself up and sits there draining the battery. If you're going to put it away for a while and not look at it, hibernate it or shut it down. The 1 minute of your life you lose waiting for it to start back up is orders of magnitude less annoying than a dead battery, believe me.\n\nThe only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is, well, it's not a Surface Pro is it? And it would have been nice to have the USB in the side of the screen half rather than the keyboard half. But in terms of value for money and suitability for purpose it pretty much ticks all the boxes for me."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "Update 12/20/2013:\nThere is one thing that i have seen that might be useful to you - while the battery on this tablet is great, sometimes i saw widely varying standby times 6% drain in couple of hours and 20% drain overnight. I had left this tablet in standby mode for 24hrs and the battery had gone down JUST 2%. What i realized is instead of locking the tablet by clicking the lock/power button, it is better to choose the Sleep mode manually through the Charms bar.\n\n12/18/2013:\nA bit of background.. i have used ipad 4, nexus 7 1 and kindle fire, but none of them compelled me to buy any of them (though i bought a kindle fire),.. their usability remained very limited for my needs. i travel frequently and did not want to lug around a laptop AND a tablet. i own MBA, which is really awesome in its own right but no touch screen and a full laptop brings in its own limitations.\nI was really interested in the transformer line of Android tablets too, but Android as a tablet OS was not really worth it then (but much better than windows RT IMO) and mobile OS like iOS and Android are still good only for media consumption and networking, not so much other stuff..\n\nInitial reviews of T100 were very mixed, with a lot of complaints regarding Quality Control. While this is typically a really BIG concern and i stay away from such products, i decided to buy this (32GB version) thinking i would return in a few days if it misbehaves.\nCouple of weeks of intensive use later i must say i am as much impressed and wowed by this device as on Day 1.\nSome Key areas where Asus has really not compromised on\n1. Battery Life - This is HUGE.. this comfortably lasts 10 hrs of use which includes ~1 hr of video chatting, ~1 hr of streaming, 2-3 hrs of browsing and email, and watch couple of movies on speaker.\n2. Screen - On paper low resolution of 1368X768 with 220 nits of brighness (most of them offer north of 400) is a bummer. But in use, it is very good. Windows Modern UI and the desktop mode both are designed such that lower resolutions do not look bad. Brightness is more than enough for most use cases and the good part is it dims well so as not to hurt eyes while reading with lights off. If you measure the distance from screen to eyes, you tend to hold tablets nearly twice the distance you would hold your phone so the pixels per inch tend to matter much less.\n3. Intel Bay Trail: Bay Trail is really awesome. Big contributing factor to excellent battery life. Everything is really zippy. I could play Skyrim at low resolution without any trouble (~20-24 fps). All games in Windows Store run really well. Graphics and speed wise i am really impressed.\n4. Keyboard: Lot of people feel the included keyboard is really crammed. While thats true, it does add a whole lot of value to user experience. It lets you see the full screen when you want to type a lot (like this review). It acts as a stand and does not limit the tablet to 2-3 positions like the surface or ipad smart case. And it takes 1 day to get used to the slightly smaller layout, and it is nearly as fast as normal keyboards from then now... The touchpad is not as bad as it is made to look.. it works well 90% of the time the rest 10% it somehow vanishes and all you need to do is lift your finger and use the touchpad again. Increase the speed of the cursor movement in Settings and things will be much better given the small area of touchpad.\n5. Full Windows 8.1 with Office: Now this is the real icing on the cake. Run anything and everything you want in something this small. I ran some heavy VBA macros that i used at work and they completed roughly same time as my 2nd gen i-5 4gb office laptop.\n6. Weight: It is just 1.2 pounds. It feels lighter than ipad4.\n7. All ports like USB 3.0 and HDMI duly covered\n\nSome let downs:\n1. The whole thing is a fingerprint magnet. Both the screen and the glossy plastic back. I really wish they had kept the brushed metal look of the keyboard on it. The first thing you need to do is buy a screen protector and all concerns with fingerprints on screen goes away.\n2. Windows 8.1 does not let you install windows apps and MS office on micro SD card. i tried all methods mentioned for Windows 8 and they failed. I moved MS Office to micro SD card and it managed to open half the documents and threw an error for the other half.. so put it back on C:. with 64 gb version you should not have any problem at all but 32gb version is like 16gb on ipad or android.\n\nOverall, in the $300-$400 price range i could not find any better do it all machine. Smaller things are taken care off too. For example the eMMC memory of Asus is much faster than on Dell Venue 8 pro and other competitors, the webcam is pretty good and fast. Asus has not compromised in areas where it matters, rather it has really excelled to bring one of the devices of the year at such a low price point.\nIf they had charged up to $200 more for this, still lots would have sold, but at this price it is one crazy hellua steal.\nIf iPads give bragging rights, Nexus Tablets the novelty then this gives you the \"Do it all\" freedom without any glitter"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I have tested and reviewed many notebook computers for years and it is not easy to impress me with any notebook computers.  And I finally found the one that really made me impressed.\n\nI have been always longing for a notebook computer whose battery time lasted more than 10 hours for actual jobs.  I know that there are some notebooks claimed to last 10 hours, however, with an actual usage, I have not seen the one close to 10 hours.  iPad might the one with 10 hour battery time but I do not categorize it as a notebook.  What I mean by the notebook here is that the computer running Windows OS (or Mac OS) and using same type of software that I use on my other desktops and portable computers every day. The Asus Transformer Book T100 lasted more than 9 hours and I would consider the T100 as my definition of a notebook computer rather than a tablet because of an included keyboard dock.  I have used the T100 more as a notebook than a tablet and carried a keyboard dock always to use Microsoft Office.  Yes, the T100 came with a keyboard dock and the home and student version of Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, Powerpoint, and OneNote) was included.  This was a big plus in that other Windows 8 tablet's keyboard dock was usually optional (sold separately).\n\n In fact, I owned a Windows 8 tablet from Acer (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Acer-Iconia-W3-810-1600-8-1-Inch-32-GB-Tablet-Silver/dp/B00CM1BN5G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Acer Iconia W3-810-1600 8.1-Inch 32 GB Tablet (Silver)</a>) and without a keyboard dock or an external keyboard, my use of the tablet was significantly limited.  So I have been using the T100 as a long-last Windows 8 notebook computer and it surely beat my other notebooks in terms of the battery time.  And I stopped carrying an AC adapter for two reasons. The first reason was that it lasted almost 10 hours and I did not practically use 10 hours outside of home.  And the second reason was that the T100 was charged through the micro USB type port and I have many micro USB type chargers here and there.  I found out that the charging time was slow but I charged the T100 overnight anyways, so that did not matter much.\n\nI was originally not a big fan of any kind of Intel Atom CPUs.  I had notebook computers with Atom CPUs and the performances were awful.  However, the Baytrail Quad Core equipped in the T100 was the first Atom CPU that I got satisfied.  Any applications running on the T100 were smooth and I did not experience any lag that I used to have in other Atom CPU notebooks. And the graphics? I would not plan to do any 3D rendering on this machine and running full HD 1080p resolution (1920*1080) video files would be a great GPU performance test for me.  And the result was excellent.  The T100 can play any full HD video that I throwed at it fine and I have not seen any hiccups.  So the overall performace of the T100 was completely satisfied.\n\nThere were 2 things that I did not like about the T100.  The first one was that I was not able to push the screen back all the way.  Probably the maximum angle I could get was 120 degree.  It was becuase of the hinge that connects the tablet to the keyboard dock.  The second one was that the keys on the keyboard dock was tiny and the shape of the right shift key was not right for me.  However, after I used it for about a month, I slowly got used to the size of the keyboard.  Still felt awkward sometimes, though.\n\nFor the price and the battery time, I would darely say this is one of the best notebook computer (not just a tablet) on the market and I have already recommended the T100 to many of my friends.  I was really glad to find a Windows machince with Microsoft Office included in this price.  Some people would be very happy to use the T100 as a tablet, but I have been extremely satistied with the T100 as a notebook computer, too.  It also has an external memory card slot so that you can double its internal 64gb memory as your storage space less than $50.  The T100 is a very well-balanced notebook/tablet in terms of the battery time, the performance, and the price.  I finally found my dream notebook computer that I have been searching for a long time.  Simply the best."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I wanted to play with this tablet combo for a while before writing the review. The packaging on this tablet is nice and holds the unit in place well.\n\nWhen unpacking the tablet I liked how it felt not too heavy but not too light  as to forget its a tablet and throw it around.\n\nI did leave it on the charger for 8 hours before starting it up. Once charged there were no problems whatsoever. The initial start up was quick. As with any new electronic unit it does take a few minutes to go through the initial start up.\n\nWhat I really like is the break away key board. I do travel quite a bit and have to sit through many meetings. It is goo to have a tablet and then a tablet with a key board. This combination has all of the coolness of a tablet and the function of a net book.\n\nI really do not have any complaints about the transformer as it has a great size and functions well\n\nJan 13 2014\nSo I took this tablet on a trip with me to finish writing my book. I have to share I love the way this unit opperates. The battery life is really good. I was able to type on the beach for 6 hours and still had about half of the battery life left. What I really like is that it is a Microsoft product so there isn't some funky app trying to get the .doc or the excel file to open. I have 2 android phones (S4 and Note 2) and 2 tablets (Motorolla Xoom & Samsung Galaxy) and working from them trying to open up files has been a complaint especially if there needs to be modifications made. The apps in the google play store do not always work well with Microsoft products. I know some people dislike Microsoft but if that doesnt matter to you then keep going. I am still not much of a fan of Windows 8 and how goofy it is.\n\nNow I have 3 things I wish I would have noticed. 1. There is only one camera and that is one the screen. If you plan on taking pictures good luck. 2. The USB port is on the keyboard, I really wish it was on the tablet. The slot for the Micro sd card is not covered, I wish it was locked in better."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "Given the poor reviews, I figured this thing would be a complete PoS -- but I wanted a reader, didn't want to buy anything proprietary, and just couldn't resist the price. (I paid $379 for mine, though they were $299 for a bit the week before Black Friday.) So pleased to discover my expectations were ill-placed.\n\nI would say I spend about 10% of my time on it figuring out ways to circumvent Windows 8.1 and its many annoyances (although early on it was probably 40% of my time on it). The rest of the time is pure fun. I take it with me everywhere, using it mostly for email and calendar. But I've also edited meeting notes, Skyped, tethered it to my phone and checked email from my (parked) car, and most importantly, Cisco VPN'd to work and RDP'd to my desktop to work. (I'm a software developer and spend most of my time in Visual Studio.) It all worked like a dream.\n\nI almost never detach it from its keyboard but sometimes tablet mode comes in handy -- like when I was working on the water heater in my basement today and I wanted to be able to view the owner's manual PDF without being required to print it. Basically holding it and (gingerly) setting it down like I would a clipboard covered with paper.\n\nThe touch screen takes some getting used to. Zeroing in on small buttons in gmail/Chrome for example. (I'm too cheap to buy a stylus and just use my pinky.) The built-in mail client that comes with Windows 8.1 is cute, but it's not integrated with gmail to the extent that I would like so I rarely use it.\n\nI did spend a little time checking out some of the games that you can download like Solitaire (the true benchmark of any Windows version.) Showing my step dad and mom (each around 70 years old) that they can play solitaire on a tablet while lying in bed was cool. My step dad is like \"where do I get one??\"\n\nIt would have been better had the keyboard been Bluetooth-enabled, but that would have probably added to the price (and I can buy a Bluetooth keyboard if I really want one).\n\nI got the 64GB version, which has about 20GB free right now. I haven't installed that much, but I imagine a 32GB version would be largely useless.\n\nIt says it has Office on it though it keeps trying to get me to sign up for Office 365 and use Skydrive. Not really interested in that and haven't had time to find the paperwork so I can activate the built-in version of Office. I also set up the Asus webstorage so it would stop nagging me about it, but I don't use that either. It hasn't once offered to install new updates, so I assume that's going on in the background. I haven't checked.\n\nIt is perfectly silent, never gets very warm, there are no fans that I can detect.\n\nDon't expect it to be a full PC. Don't install a bunch of crap on it. It's got 2 GB of RAM. Everyone knows you can't do anything with that. Just use it for email, a reader, and maybe some light computing, and you won't be disappointed. Need more CPU? RDP somewhere.\n\nAnyway, could go on for quite some time. I really love it and highly recommend it."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "TLDR: Outstanding machine for the price.  A lot of the initial issues/complaints around battery life and responsiveness are addressed through updates, particularly BIOS 220.  If you don't know how or have never flashed your BIOS before, make sure you're comfortable with the process before attempting it on your own, or you may brick your machine.\n\n===================================================================================================\n\nI'll caveat this review by saying I picked this up at the Microsoft Store on a Black Friday sale for $299.  From that perspective, I find the value of this machine to be absolutely incredible.  So incredible I went back the next day and bought two more for other members of my family.\n\nWhere to start.  The screen on this, while certainly not a top of the line retina display, is pretty great.  Battery power is super impressive.  I've gone about 4 days between charges and light usage (streaming music, light web browsing).  It loses about 2-3% overnight in sleep mode, which comes out to about 1% every two hours on my sleep schedule (more on this later).\n\nPerformance is extremely snappy.  I was told to expect Bay Trail to perform about twice as well as Clover Trail and that's exactly my experience when comparing my experience on this device to my Acer Iconia W3.  The W3 was great for getting basic tasks done.  So is this.  But I can also do so much more and do so smoothly.  iTunes runs just fine.  I've installed photoshop which runs just fine.  I've used Windows Move Maker to edit movies and output in 1080p.  It handles all these tasks about as well as my late 2008 unibody macbook.\n\nI think they included keyboard is great.  The layout is a little small and takes some getting used to (especially the right shift key), but what can you expect from this form factor?  The OEM keyboard on the Iconia W3 was easier to type on but was actually about 2 inches longer than the tablet itself and about 1 inch longer than this T100 tablet.  The trackpad was sticky (again, more on that later), but has gotten better after installing some updates.  I rarely use the trackpad in any case because the touchscreen is so responsive.\n\nThe speakers on this thing are great. Compared to other tablets and mobile devices I've owned, they're probably the loudest I've heard, although not without distortion.  Hoooking this thing up to my HDTV via micro HDMI was snap.  Given it's computing abilities, it's the first tablet I could actually see using as a desktop replacement if I wanted to add a usb keyboard, mouse, and external monitor.  You won't be doing heavy duty tasks on this (although it handles gaming exceptionally well for an Atom machine-- check out some of the youtube videos).\n\nA few things I would recommend after picking up three of these things (of course, take this advice at your own risk, and if you don't know what you're doing find someone who does to help):\n1) Before powering up the first time, make sure it's plugged in.  Feel free to use it while it's plugged in, but DON'T UNPLUG IT FOR 8 HOURS.  I had one where I didn't do this and had some issues with the battery.  Coincidence?  Maybe.  But the other two worked fine and I kept them plugged in.\n2) UPDATE IT.  Open up Windows update and download all the updates.  At your own discretion, you could also check the drivers on your machine against the latest versions for the T100 on ASUS's website and perform those updates as well.\n3) Do a google search for the transformer book forum and find the sub forum for the T100.  Read through all of the configuration and update threads.\n4) Use Winflash to update the BIOS to the latest version.  Mine shipped with BIOS 214 and had some issues, particularly with standby battery drain and touchpad responsiveness.  After I flashed to BIOS 220, all those problems have gone away.  If you aren't familiar with the process of updating your BIOS, FIND SOMEONE WHO IS TO HELP YOU.  I can't stress that point enough.  If you don't know what you're doing you can brick (i.e. permanently destroy) your machine.\n\nAdditional Edit: Depending on where you purchased the T100, you may be available for 1 year of complimentary accidental damage protection from ASUS.  Google \"ASUS Accidental Damage\" for more details.  This might save some money for those folks looking at Squaretrade or other third party warranties.  Consider also the CC you use for the purchase as many cards offer extended warranty protection as well (for example the World Mastercard program doubles manufacturer's warranties on any products purchased fully with the card, which in this case, doubles the ASUS's complimentary ADP protection to two years)."}

The USB 3.0 port on the keyboard make this machine much more than tablet.  Windows 8.1 takes some getting use to, but I am really starting to like it.  The screen could be better, but this is a sub$400 machine.  I would go for the 64gb version, because 32gb is just not enough for the OS and software.  Oh and MS Office comes bundled free.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I like this device enough that it prompted me to write a review for my fellow shoppers to make an informed decision.\n\nI'm not going to go over the pros and cons as other reviewers are already posted, so have it at.  What I'm going to share is my frustrated experience, but yet rewarding in the end.\n\nSo I'm on my 3rd (yeah you heard me right, 3rd) tablet now and why you ask?\n\nWell, the trouble began when I bought the initial one.  It was the first edition of the production version which as firmware 212.  It has its own issues as widely reported on the internet.  I went then to Asus site and found a 214 version that promised to fix some issues.  I went and download the firmware and using Winflash to update; this is where the frustration comes.\n\nWithin winflash, I kept receiving the \"Cannot allocate buffer\" error upon flashing.  I later found out that there is another flashing utility within the BIOS itself called Easy Flash.  Well off I went to download the bios to the USB drive and load it up into Easy Flash within the bios.  Flash went fine, but the device never power on after that, it is now in the COMPLETE BRICKED state.  OK, so I went online searching and some others reported bricking with same approach.  I ended upFurther research, I read some guidelines on how to \"proper\" flash using Easy Flash utility.  One of them was using FAT32 USB stick.  Fine, with the 2nd unit (I exchanged in at the local store), I carefully formatted as suggested, and same result was a BRICK using Easy Flash.  OK so fast-forward to the 3rd one...this time I really evaluated my options and finally got it to flash using Winflash which in turns in calls Easy Flash.\n\nThe reason it worked because I skipped enabling Wifi and just signed in with local account.  Then I removed the SDCard (which I previously had it inserted while flashing using Easy Flash) this time around and went smooth to 220.\n\nAfter all of that, I now have a great tablet/netbook at hand which I used to replace my dead Nexus 7.\n\nSo lesson learned: Remove all the everything that is not needed to ensure and refresh to factory state before trying to flash."}

I am a person who uses the chromebook as a 2nd computer, but finds that the chromebook is so much swifter and handles a lot of basic daily tasks, including what has been traditionally Word, Excel, and Powerpoint tasks (now in Google Docs/Drive).  So it may be a 2nd computer, but I spend 90+% of my time on the chromebook.  But I diverge.  This little Transformer is a perfect \"first computer\" for someone like me who needs a Microsoft for occasional management of music collection, printing (cloud printing is through logging into Google account when you don't have an eprinter.

Anyway, with Office 2013 and full windows, the machine is perfect for someone who just wants to do the basic functions of Windows from time-to-time, but is also an excellent transitional device for those who realize that we are probably all (or most of us) are travelling into the cloud and having a slow (and slower everyday) local running device with endless updates and security problems.

And, for less than $350!\n\n***\nThis is the first Windows computer I've owned in more than 20 years.  Incidentally, this comes just one week after I bought my stepson a Toshiba Satellite notebook (and being greatly impressed with its performance, as well.)\n\nThere are a number of things that jumps out at you when working with this laptop hybrid:\n\n* Compact features. This is should be in the category of \"sub\" notebooks.  This is about the same size as my old, Contaq \"Contura Aero.\"  Measuring 7\" x 10.5\".  And, it weighs about 2 lbs.\n\nThe notebook-tablet is a hybrid but it's a fully-functioning Windows laptop that you can access by the detachable keyboard or by a 5-point touch screen.\n\n*** App's Store ***\n\nThe Windows App store has an impressive library of app's--more than triple from last year, although well behind the iTunes Store and the Google Play/ Android app stores.\n\n*** Spec's ***\n\n32GB SSD HDD\n3GB DDR2\nQuad-core \"Bay Trail\" processor @ 1.3Ghz\n10.1\" screen with 1366 x 768 resolution\nMicrosoft Office 2013 H&S\n10+ hours of charge.  (I've only re-charged it once in 3 weeks.)\nBluetooth 4.0\n\nOnly $399\n\n*** Performance ***\n\nMore than anything else, I'm wonderfully surprised at how well this laptop works.  It's always been opinion that a Windows PC's only makes sense from a budgetary standpoint.  But, this hybrid is extremely useful (and this is coming from a diehard Apple fanatic) for operations more than word processing.\n\nThe first thing you'll immediately notice is that the laptop powers on from push power to fully operational in 5 seconds.  5 seconds!  The SSD drive is incredibly fast, much faster than I anticipated.\n\nThis also translates to word processing app's to browsing the internet to playing games.\n\nThe keyboard is close-cropped but it wasn't so cramped like the Compaq I used to own that I find myself hitting the Shift Key when I wanted to hit the Comma key.\n\nWorking with art app's like Sketchbook Pro was what I was most interested in finding out.  It works flawlessly via a stylus and when a Wacom Bamboo tablet is attached, it also gives me options.\n\nNetflix and other necessary app's are another plus because with more than 10 hours of battery life, I can work or play without needing to have an ac outlet nearby.\n\nI'd also like to mention that this hybrid is connected to a power source by a micro usb to usb connection, so you have the option to plug into another computer to charge, an external battery or if you have a usb-ac adapter, you can plug it right into the wall.\n\n*** Price vs. Value ***\n\nThe retail price is $400.  I've seen it as low as $350.  But, you have the best of what's offer for a \"better\" laptop at $800.\n\n+ Super fast SSD drive\n+ 10-hour battery life\n+ Touchscreen or keyboard\n+ Windows 8.1 (and you can get rid of that gaudy Metro screen)\n+ Lightweight and compact.\n+ Hybrid computer gives you access to both traditional Windows app's and touchscreen app's simultaneously.\n+ For a budget price--it is a MUCH better option than a similar hybrid (from other manufacturers) and budget laptops.\n\nIf there's a downside, it may be for people who want a optical drive, it would have to be purchased separately.\n\nThis is an absolutely great laptop/tablet where you're not sacrificing performance, portability or versatility if you prefer one style of computer over the other."}

The system is delivered with 50GB usable, and after os and a couple of items I had installed, I was only left with 28 GB.\n Perform the ASUS bios updates immediately (resolved issues with sound card, portrait/landscape auto rotation).\n Using the Uninstall programs option native to windows, uninstall and reinstall all C++ redistribution packages from 2005 forward (only 2008 comes installed as delivered), 32 bit system.

Some have complained about the screen, but if you want to watch movies - you should get a Kindle. The screen is perfectly adequate. Charge time good and my wife even likes it ... can't get it away from her.  For 349 it far surpasses anything currently on the market."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I bought this for my daughter who is Autistic and after watching her frustration trying to use the huge laptop computer with loads of memory and programs, I decided she needs something smaller and easier to use. She has had it for a few weeks and I have not heard one complaint. She tells me it loads pages quickly and she loves the touch screen. It came with a blue tooth keyboard which seems to be pretty good quality for the money. I don't think you could go wrong if you don't need the larger screen with the complications of a laptop. This is just the right size for my 24 year old Autistic daughter. I made a good purchase here."}

I'm considering either buying more of these or surface pro3. Only downside is I,have not figured out how to bypass UEFI to install ANDROID for dual boot with Windows.\n\nDecember 2013\nI've had the Asus t100 for 5 days now and am loving it. I bought it for $379 at Wal-Mart and after,their $25 off,for opening a credit,card resulted in paying only $354 for 64gb ssd. the device compares favorably for,doing basic web page, email, video playback, and networking. I ran 1080p video on trench LCD and it looked fantastic. it is speedy with the quadcore and one cannot easily discern that it's not an i3 or i5 processor. Looked great on 27 inch LCD. tablet detached with ease and overall build quality is excellent considering the price. there's nothing out there that is this good!!!! it comes with office 2013 student which makes it all the more of a deal. I will eventually get android dual booting but that's not working just yet- word on the street is this will happen very,soon. I have yet to find major faults. So buy one!\n\nUPDATED 12/18/2013\nThe T100 comments made earlier stand. It's an outstanding device for the price with excellent build quality. The SD CARD write execution is a little longer than I expect. All networking connections working superb. Docking interface is extremely robust. It is true that the keyboard is more difficult to type on than regular size and finger fatigue would be a factor for any sustained typing. The more I use the device the more I appreciate the design. I am still looking forward to having dual-boot to Android capability and will provide an update when that has been completed."}

The only thing that I did not like was the fact that the third party company did not include an invoice and there was no phone number to call.  When I got the product the keyboard on the docking device would not work.  Fortunately, I contacted the company, ASUS, and they were most helpful.  I highly recommend the ASUS Transformer Book T100 but make sure that you do not get it from JustBest as there is no way to contact them directly."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I needed this product right away for my new job, and did not wait for Amazon to restock.  Instead, I picked mine up at my local WalMart.  Since it is again available, I will go ahead and post a review.  I read all the reviews for the Asus T100 before buying, and like most others, I felt it was a great value except for the annoying, shiny, fingerprint-magnet surfaces.  So I bought the Skinomi TechSkin for it.  I had absolutely no problem installing it and had it on, pretty close to perfect, in under 30 minutes.  I do have a lot of experience installing similar products though.  Right now, the screen looks kind of grainy, but that should clear up completely within a day or so.  The result is excellent.  The Asus T100 looks so much better, and NO fingerprints ANYWHERE.  I am very happy with both products.\n\nAlso, other reviews, and videos on YouTube, mentioned problems with the keyboard and trackpad.  I am happy to say that mine had none of those issues.  It might be unclear to people, as it was to me, that the bottom two corners of the trackpad are \"mouse\" buttons and depress slightly to click and select.\n\nWhile it does take a long time to charge fully (USB) it was usable right out of the box while plugged in.  i have used it heavily for several workdays now and have gone home each day with at least 30% charge left on it.\n\nI have very small hands, so typing on it is actually much easier for me than a standard sized keyboard.  I love it.  But I can see where it would be more difficult for someone like my husband.\n\nI have loaded it up with software, and as usual, have many things open at one time.  The Asus is keeping up with no noticeable lag in performance.\n\nThe screen resolution is noticeably less than some other products ONLY IF YOU PLACE THEM SIDE-BY-SIDE.  Alone, it just looks like a nice, crisp, clear display.\n\nI was so excited about this product because it ships with full Windows 8.1 (which I love so far) and Office Home and Student 2013.  I was particularly excited about OneNote as I've been using a knockoff but compatible app on my iPad.  I am very disappointed in Office 2013 and OneNote in particular, as they've adopted a very austere look, much like iPad's OS7.  I hate them both.  That's my only niggling gripe, and that is not Asus' fault, so I'm rating it 5 stars, and thanking my lucky ones I found this product."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "Edit: Well I either dropped it or someone stepped on it while it was in a laptop sleeve. The USB port is dented so I can't use it and there is a crack running all the way to the other side on the bezel. Another one running all the way up on the top left side. The bottom left corner is totally cracked. I can't believe this cracked so easy! My last phone I had that cracked on me was a flip phone from 2007! My iPad 2 has gotten dents but not cracks! I bought this from bestbuy so probably won't let me return it and Asia's warranty doesn't cover misuse. I will probably just return it if I can. But that probably isn't going to happen. I will update this if I am able to get a return or repair. (If I do return it and get my money back I will get a dell venue 11 pro or wait for 64-bit windows tablets.)\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW: I have been using this tablet for almost a week. I picked the 32gb model up at bestbuy for $299 with $25 windows store credit (still have the deal on website, go get it!). Out of 32gb there was about 12 gb free. Now there is about 5.5gb free so definetely get the 64gb model if you don't plan on using micro sd card. I have a 64gb sd card from my surface rt that i put in here, you can run apps from the sd card but it will be slower. Since windows 8 comes with free music streaming I havn't had a need to put my music on here.\nThe only issues I have had with this device is build quality and charging. I can forgive build quality because of price, the keyboard dock feels great but tablet is plastic and feels like it will flex with pressure. Ok I know alot of reviews have mentioned slow charging and complained about it not sleeping. This morning i woke it up with 8% left from 60% last night. This is the first time it has done this, another review mentioned using the shortcut on the keyboard (fn f1) to put it to sleep. So I plugged it in around 10:15 with 4% and it was about 50% at 12:00. Now it is 3:11 and I have taken it off the charger and it is on 93%, so IDK if you consider that slow but it is a little slower than my Ipad 2. Also if you are using this heavily and charging at the same time it actually drains in power. Make sure you use the adapter and cable that came with this or else it will charge even slower.\nWHEN YOU FIRST TURN IT ON GOTO PC SETTINGS AND DISABLE WINDOWS UPDATES! I have read so many reviews that they have updated it and it wouldn't turned on or failed. So i just disabled it and ignore the messages saying to download and install updates. If you must update then do a system image backup so you can restore if something goes wrong.\n\nOk now to the positives. I don't know why everyone complains about the keyboard. It is a little bit smaller than regular keyboard and the right shift key is smaller but I only use left shift so it doesn't bother me. I am typing the review on the keyboard right now and I am not typing slower than I do on my macbook pro. I havn't had many problems with the touchpads, it makes a nice click sound and it hasn't been gimmicky, if it does act up disable the gestures. I love the fact that is doesn't have a windows button on the front. On my surface rt I always hit it when holding it in portrait mode. I don't like the windows button on this. It makes a creaky sound every time I press it, the other buttons don't do that. I just use the start button on the keyboard or charms menu. I can't tell you how good battery life is but it has to be at least 7 hours.\nSOFTWARE\nI loved windows 8. The ability to have a laptop and tablet in one device amazed me. But I bought a surface rt when it just came out and never got to use desktop applications. Now with windows 8.1 and intel baytrail there is the asus t100 with FULL WINDOWS AND NO LIMITATIONS! It is wonderful! I can run all my desktop apps and metro apps. If you consider an android tablet over this don't! With bluestacks you can run all your android apps on it. I can have candy crush and Plants vs Zombies. It is a little slow on PvS but it runs fine on candy crush. So you have all your android apps on here, your desktop apps and metro apps. What more could you want? I considered an IPAD AIR BUT IT IS NOT WORTH THE PRICE! $599 for 32gb! I got this for half as much and it is a full computer not a toy. If you buy an Ipad over this there is something wrong with you, there is no reason to buy any android or Ipad tablet that costs more than this. In fact you can sync and charge an ipad using the asus t100 and have full itunes.\n\nWrapup\nFor the price this is the best tablet convertible ever! If you want android apps it runs them! Runs all your desktop programs and you can use it as a desktop with micro hdmi cable. If I ignore the price the only complaints would be build quality and no keyboard battery. If you want something like this then there is the dell venue 11 pro which is $499 tablet only plus $160 for keyboard dock, it wasn't worth paying $360 more for it for me. There is a i3 and i5 version for $800/$850 so get that if you wanted the power of surface pro. There should be more convertibles like this coming out next year with 64-bit windows so you could wait for them. I say go get one now! You won't regret it!"}

I remember the first time I saw the iPhone and said to myself 'this changes everything' and it did.\n\nI received the ASUS T100 64gb with Windows 8.1 yesterday and well honestly the first thing I thought was any iOS device is just plain boring next to the ASUS Transformer and Windows 8.1.  This computer (the 64gb version) and Windows 8.1 (amazing OS and very nice looking next to iOS 7) are just simply amazing.  I love this machine and would have paid $399 for it but I lucked out and got for $299 at BJ's online. That deal and the ASUS Transformer is no longer offered by BJ's at this time but I suppose it could come back though.\n\nThis computer changes everything with hybrid PC/Tablet that works flawlessly out of the box, has GREAT battery life, is light and yet is a true full PC.  Do not hesitate to buy this computer as you will love it.  Any problems that reviewers note here must have be fixed because I have not experienced any problems with the tablet or the keyboard."}

I do believe the pros out weigh the cons in this though.\n\nI was lucky enough to receive a machine that updated perfectly fine. Didn't go through any special process that anyone mentioned in the reviews. Just opened it and updated it once it was done charging for 8 hours. This thing is lightweight and convenient. Runs everything that I need it to run (so far). I do plan on updating with the gaming capability it has, but there are youtube reviews showing that now already. Battery life is remarkable for the most part. I have no qualms with the screen brightness (though I haven't tested it to the fullest extent). Keyboard is good. It may be small, but I adapted to it fairly quickly. Went through some typing test to get comfortable with it.\n\nNow for the bad. The micro-usb cable it comes with is short. Shorter than any standard smartphone micro-usb cable. I'm sure you can swap it though. The screen and back attract fingerprints like no tomorrow as well. Something I don't mind since I'm usually using the docking. Touchpad isn't the best. Someone mentioned that it goes into sleep mode (saves battery). The clicking of the touchpad is loud but I tap so whatever. Charge time maybe a bit long (I haven't charged it much so not 100% sure).\n\nThat's about it. I'll update it later on into my uses. I've had it for about 2 weeks now."}

But It will probably be easy to adapt to the keyboard in due time.\n\nThirdly, and this is my biggest complaint, the laptop does not expand further than 90 degrees. I'm not a big person, I'm about 5'2\" and this laptop just seemed like the screen was too low.

It is light weight and small so no problem to keep in a brief case without carrying a separerate bag for a full size laptop.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "Asus T100:\n\nWhat can I say about this piece of cutting edge technology...\n\nI've owned it long enough to have a good feel for it's strengths and weakness's.\n\nPRO'S:\nFor under $400 this is my primary work and school computer, it comes with MS Office Home and Student (full version), which is $140.\nThe hardware is good enough to play most modern games on Low to medium settings at default resolution.\nAmple 64GB Hard Drive; it's big enough for tons of games, windows store apps, Pictures, documents... And with Asus Web Storage and MS cloud storage, my HDD still has plenty of room, even without an extra memory card.\nBecause of advancements in software development, not having a DVD-R/W drive is not a problem. Video's from web services, Remote Desktop for viewing your home recordings remotely, and Virtual drives for accessing otherwise unavailable games, the limitations of such a compact platform can be mitigated.\nThe built in Bluetooth, WiFi, USB 3.0, crisp IPS 720+ HD display, USB charging instead of a proprietary charger, perfectly performing multi-touch on the display and 12+ hour battery life, rounds off this less than $400 bargain.\nAND, this beauty starts in an instant and only sips power while unplugged in sleep mode, meaning instant starts without having to power the thing off and only have around 8% less battery than when I fell asleep 7+ hours ago.\n\nCON'S:\nThe built in WiFi is actually a 2-in-1 chip, bluetooth and wifi. While using the bluetooth the internet WILL RANDOMLY STOP RECEIVING... which means that if you are connected to WiFi for more than 2 hours with your bluetooth headset in, watching an awesome movie... it will just randomly stop working. Super annoying.\nAlso, the bluetooth seems to share a bit of the processing bandwidth with the WiFi, which means a little slower internet connection. It's not a huge deal but can definitely detract from a 720p HD video experience because of slower communication rates.\nThe USB 2.0 charging cable is incredibly short compared to a normal laptop. The charge time is also very very slow. With the brightness all the way up the battery will actually discharge while plugged in, while using it. Thankfully even at 50% brightness it is amazingly clear, crisp and bright. On that note, it has built in USB 3.0, which has MUCH higher amperage tolerances, what in the world was ASUS thinking not giving us USB 3.0 charging capabilities, KNOWING it would be backwards with USB 2.0 chargers and devices....\nThe on-screen keyboard does NOT always show when I want it to... in fact the only time I can guarantee it showing up is when first logging into windows.\nATKOSD2.exe is an absolute waste of manpower, skills, MY computers resources and my own personal sanity. What a horrible idea to even install that software into the laptop. It isn't even turned on (ATKOSD2.exe is a file name which means Asus Tool Key On Screen Display). Out of all the problems that I've had with this laptop, that one was the worst. And if you tell that file to show on screen, it will show the darn overlay continuously, which oscillates between \"AC Connected\" and \"AC Disconnected\"...\nI deleted that file as soon as I realized it was crashing my video games, causing my keyboard to not function, and eat up all my computer resources.\nLast problem I had was with the single USB 3.0 jack in the keyboard dock. Sometimes it decides to recognize older USB 2.0 devices, and most of the time not. Once it recognizes the device, it usually works 100% of the time thereafter, with the exception of printers.\n\nOverall, this was an exceptional value. EVERYTHING has a negative, and this product is no exception. For the average student or Employee on the go, with the need to be connected, this product is absolutely unbeatable for the price.\n\nI recommend it to EVERYONE I meet."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "Over a period of several weeks I tried out the following.  (I will post this same review in Amazon under each device.)\n\n1. ASUS Transformer T100 hybrid tablet/notebook \n2. Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 Tablet\n3. Google Nexus 10 tablet\n\nI also looked at an iPad Air.  They are way overpriced.  And I still have a grudge against Apple for the 2012 hard drive recall they had on our 27\" iMac.  It was a total disaster.  We didn't lose any data but it took weeks and endless phone calls to get it running right again.\n\nAfter spending a day getting used to Windows 8, I thought the ASUS might be the one I was going to keep.  I actually only tried it for two days.  Early on day three I shut it down only to have it remain on the \"Shutting Down\" screen for an extended time period.  So I powered it off.  Apparently, my bad.  Subsequently it would not reboot into Windows, reset or repair even after talking with ASUS Tech Support.  They asked me to return it to them for repair.  I declined and returned it to Wally World.\n\nI liked the ASUS.  It was attractive but a fingerprint magnet both front and back. And it was more difficult to use than Android.  The two issues that bothered me most were the lack of a Swype app and the complications of dictation.  The best Swype-type app in the Windows Store is TouchPal.  It ain't that good.  First of all the virtual keyboard is large. Your finger has to cover a lot of real estate to enter characters.  Also, the word prediction accuracy sucks. Windows-supported dictation was not that accurate, so I had to go into Google to dictate.  This was not nearly as handy as being in a Google operating system to begin with.  I use Swype and dictation a lot.\n\nThe mentioned issues relate to Windows 8 not the physical unit.  I liked the ASUS unit enough that I discovered they make several similar models running Android.  After checking these out I found they were either running old versions of Android or cost a couple of hundred dollars more than the two Samsung models mentioned here.  So, that ended that.\n\nIt was hard to choose between the Nexus and the Galaxy,  Both are made by Samsung.  I waited several weeks to see if a new Nexus 10 was coming out but to no avail.\n\nAs far as looks go, the Galaxy is very thin and attractive.  In my opinion it is as nice looking as an iPad even though it has more plastic.  I had the white one so fingerprints were not that visible.  The Galaxy gets compliments for its narrow bezels.  However these are really a functional negative. They cause you to touch and activate stuff on the screen accidentally quite often.  Makes me suspect the iPad has the same problem.  There are a lot of complaints about the large area of sensitivity for the three built-in keys at the bottom of the Galaxy.  However I thought this was minor compared to the narrow side bezels.  (You can probably negate the side bezel problem by putting the unit in a folio case. It could give you more to hang onto.) The speakers are on the top of the sides and are easy to cover up when holding the unit.\n\nThough made by Samsung, because Google's name is on it the Nexus is first in line for Android updates. It has already downloaded the latest Android version, KitKat.  It will also be the first to get future updates since there is no manufacturer software OS overlay to wait for.  It is pure Android--no bloatware.  In terms of specs, the Nexus blows the other two units away.  The broad bezels may not be as attractive but they give you something to hang onto without accidental screen touches.  The Nexus' rubber-like coating on the back is better for grip and not a fingerprint magnet.  Less bling but more practical. The Nexus' speakers are on the on the front, the best place.\n\nEven though I did not keep the Galaxy and its specs are much less impressive than the Nexus, I found it perfectly satisfactory for my needs.  I do mainly Web browsing, Email, some text and spreadsheet documents and a few non-graphic intensive games. I bought all of these units from local big box stores.  The Nexus 10 was $400 and the two Samsung units were only about $30 less.\n\nAfter considerable researching of portable Bluetooth keyboards, I ordered and just received a Kensington KeyFolio Pro 2 Universal Case and Keyboard.  I bought this from Amazon and will review it when I have had it for awhile.  So far this looks like a terrific and attractive accessory  I will probably keep the Nexus in the protective case without the keyboard most of the time.  I will use the keyboard when I do a lot of data entry."}

There's a reason the price looks too good to be true.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "It is taking a while to get used to Windows 8. There are not as many apps and more of the apps that are free on Android cost money with Microsoft. Typing on the screen can be difficult sometimes if you are using it as a standalone tablet and some websites are not as responsive to a touch on the screen as they are using a mouse or touchpad. There have been a few times in trying to type something out real quick on Facebook that it was just easier to grab my phone and do it that way.\n\nIt works well as a small computer when the keyboard is attached and works best in this configuration. It is a nice tablet but not the best if you want to just use the tablet for typing or moving through websites. I was attempting to watch Amazon Prime Video through website (because there is no microsoft app) and I grabbed the tablet at the end of a show and instantly purchased the entire season for $80 even though it is free through Prime. I was refunded, but it would be nice to not have to worry about those things. I suppose that would be solved with an Amazon app, but at this point in time that is a part of the drawback in that there aren't as many apps.\n\nI think most of the time I will use it with the keyboard, but it is nice to remove the screen if I just want to watch a movie or read."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I've seen the mixed reviews on this device, so I thought I would throw in my experience, which has been only positive.  I have owned it (the 64GB version) a little over two weeks, and I got a great deal on it off of a Cyber Monday discounted price that Amazon was offering.\n\nAs others have mentioned, the first thing I did was to leave it alone for a couple of hours and let it charge.  After that, I fired it up and let it do the Windows update thing, and there were quite a few that were queued up to process.  I also recently updated the BIOS  from version 214 to version 220 with no issues.\n\nI bought this mainly to take with me when traveling....to watch movies on, surf the web, do email, view photos, etc. My main hesitation in buying it was the specs for the screen resolution.  I was a little nervous about it not being \"retina\" quality, but my fears were without merit....I think the image quality is excellent.  It is plenty snappy when browsing the web, powers on quickly, and the battery lasts me a good eight hours with normal use.\n\nIt's so thin even with the keyboard attached, I doubt if I will go to the tablet-only mode very often. But, it's nice to know I have that option.  I also like the fact that it has USB 3.0, albeit on the keyboard and not off of the screen section, and that it has micro HDMI out so that I can connect it to a television if I want to, which will come in handy when traveling with the kids and they want to watch a movie on the hotel television.\n\nHere are a few things I bought to go with it:\n\n1. A longer USB charging cable - The one that comes with it is way too short, and this one is five feet long.  Keep in mind that this cable is for charging ONLY, no data transfer, but that allows for a faster charging time.&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/PortaPow-Specialised-5ft-24AWG-Charge-Only-Micro-USB-Cable-for-Blackberry-Xperia-HTC-One-Google-Nexus-Other-Fast-Charging-Devices/dp/B0088HTYUE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">PortaPow Specialised 5ft 24AWG Charge Only Micro USB Cable for Blackberry, Xperia, HTC One, Google Nexus, Other Fast Charging Devices</a>\n\n2.  A case to keep it in - This case is probably more bulky than most people would prefer, but I like having the extra protection.&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/iGadgitz-Black-EVA-Travel-Hard-Case-Cover-Sleeve-for-Asus-Eee-Pad-TF201-Transformer-Prime-TF300-TF300t-TF700t-Infinity-Android-Tablet-with-Keyboard-TF101-Tablet-without-keyboard-Asus-Vivo-Tab-RT-TF600-TF600T-10-1-3G-LTE-Tablet-with-Keyboard/dp/B005HI4FPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">iGadgitz Black EVA Travel Hard Case Cover Sleeve for Asus Eee Pad TF201 Transformer Prime & TF300 TF300t + TF700t Infinity Android Tablet with Keyboard & TF101 Tablet (without keyboard) & Asus Vivo Tab RT TF600 TF600T 10.1\" 3G LTE Tablet (with Keyboard)</a>\n\n3.  A HDMI micro connector cable - This was to allow me to connect the Transformer to a television, as I mentioned above. You will, of course, still need a regular HDMI cable as well (I have many already on hand).&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Monoprice-6inch-34AWG-High-Speed-HDMI-Cable-With-Ethernet-HDMI-Micro-Connector-male-to-HDMI-Connector-female-Black/dp/B00507GV38/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Monoprice 6inch 34AWG High Speed HDMI Cable With Ethernet - HDMI Micro Connector male to HDMI Connector female - Black</a>\n\n4.  A small sling to carry it around in - I like to keep everything together for any tablet or laptop I have, and this little sling was just the right size.  Everything fits nicely, and it is very compact.  The Transformer even fits when it is in the iGadgitz case I mention above in item 2.&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/SOLO-Storm-Collection-Universal-10-Inch-Tablet-Sling-STM751-4/dp/B008Y8E25Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">SOLO Storm Collection Universal 10-Inch Tablet Sling (STM751-4)</a>\n\n5.  A Bluetooth mouse - I use this to keep the single 3.0 USB port freed up.  Actually, I had purchased this a couple of years ago, so I already had it on hand.  So far it has worked great with the Transformer.&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Connectland-CL-MOU23014-Bluetooth-Wireless-Optical-Mouse/dp/B003AVN6C0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Connectland CL-MOU23014 Bluetooth Wireless Optical Mouse</a>\n\nAll in all, I am very pleased with this purchase.  I had my Kindle Fire stolen (grrrr....), and I ended up getting this to replace it.  No, it does not have the variety of apps that you'll find for Android devices and certainly not the choice you get with an iPad.  But, for my purposes, it works great.  I love having the keyboard and a full version of Windows, and having MS Office Home and Student included makes it even more appealing.\n\nIf things change, I will update this review, but for now, I couldn't be more pleased with my purchase!"}

Having used android tablets and phones for years has made the switch interesting. I have been using this tablet everyday for the past two weeks and really enjoy it now. I agree with some reviews that the power button could be better. I haven't had any mechanical problems with it, it is a question of being able to feel the little thing and learning to hold it down to activate it. For the price this tablet Pc is hard to beat. The battery is slow to charge but goes for at least 10 hours. I let it charge for 30 minutes before I turned it on the first time and had no problems with the start up set up. Just leave it plugged in. Make sure you have a fast and stable  WiFi connection and it will be the usual windows update thing. I feel like the quality of most apps is better than Android although there aren't as many yet. To me the look and feel of the new interface is better than the android tablets I have used. This was a good purchase for the price.\nI guess I got a good deal also. Only paid $319."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "Here's the deal, if you want something light that runs windows 8.1 with office and a keyboard all in one... then look no further. This unit was not purchased at Amazon, but I just wanted to share my experience to help those that are interested in it.\n\nI was looking for a desktop laptop replacement that I could easily transport from work and home. This seemed too good to be true, but it has lived up to it's ability. Now I say ability, because you have to know what you are buying.\n\n1. CPU: It isn't going to be the fasted thing since it has a 1.83 processor, but it isn't going to be slow either. The quad-core processor isn't an issue. It actually works just fine. I run office, photoshop CC, Illustrator CC, Indesign CC with no real problems. They all work fine. I use this now as my primary device, no more bulky laptop.\n2. RAM: 2GB RAM is plenty for windows 8.1 using just office and the browsers. It does max out with multiple apps open and large applications like photoshop as well. I just make sure I close unused apps and programs when in my bulky ram eating programs. No big deal, for this price you get a lot, we are just spoiled with the \"we want it all now\" mentality we have grown into having. A 4GB version would make this thing amazing.\n3. Video: Video playback is great, youtube playback and micro hdmi out work just fine.\n4: Keyboard & touchpad: Not the greatest, but it has one. The fact that it is included with this price is amazing! I actually connect a usb keyboard and bluetooth mouse to this for my heavy work. All other browsing and fun is used in tablet mode. It does drop the bluetooth connection with the mouse after a period of time, but remains paired. FN F2 keys applied twice turns on and off airplane mode, which reconnects my mouse. No big, don't know if it is the mouse (HP x4000b *known for connection issues) or the tablet. Either way, it is quick to fix the connection and I don't have to go through many settings to get back to work. This also works for a dropped WIFI connection, which I don't have issues with dropping connections like I've seen others.\n5. Battery: It lasts a long time. I don't have defined hours, but I can use it all day at work just on battery and bring it home to play with and charge at night. Or... use it all day at work while plugged in and bring it home to play with on battery for the night. You won't be displeased with it.\n6. Overall performance: I am very happy with this product and do recommend it if you are looking for a light production tablet/laptop device. I am an IT/webdesigner and it works great for me. For those doing heavy RAM eating work like video editing... the 2GB won't be enough, heck I max it out just in Photoshop. I just watch what is open and it suits me fine. Daily, I run Photoshop, InDesign, Wamp, Office, Notepad ++ and even remote into other computers. It works for me, just know it won't be a top performer... it does the job that I need it to do.\n\nAs a side note, I did shop the Dell Venue Pro 11, Surface, Transformer Android version (forget T#, think is is T701 or something like that) and ultrabooks in the persuit of the \"biggest bang for the buck\". All others priced way too high for what I wanted to spend. This is what I chose and am very happy. I was skeptical and worried that it would be junk, but am glad I made the leap. Also, this may seem fanboyish and possibly fake for my hype... it's not ... all I can say haha. Good luck with your choice and hope this helps your decision.\n\nI actually just came here to look for cases haha."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I will say outright that I was surprised by how much I like this tablet.  I am a long-time iPad, Mac OS X, and Win 7 user.  This was my first exposure to Win 8.  While IMHO Windows 8 leaves a lot to be desired, this tablet definitely makes the best of it.  The construction has a solid enough feel for the price range.  The tablet feels sturdy and not too hefty (probably twice the weight of my iPad Air), but it handles well thanks to the curved back and large bezel.  The keyboard feels cheaper and has a cheaper tactile feel.  The touchpad is loud to click, but a tap works too, which saves the noise if you are in a quiet environment.  If you are in a meeting, that touchpad click could be disruptive (yes, it's that noticeable).  The responsiveness of the touch screen was very good, as is the accuracy.  I had no trouble touching article hyperlinks, on CNN for example, and the web site came up quickly.  The resolution and clarity of the screen are fine, comparable to an iPad 2; and I found the color to be very rich and clean (albeit I am not a graphics pro, so for the casual user at least, the color is fine).  The tablet separates from the keyboard base easily and without missing a beat, and connects back up just as easily.  The touch screen is quite a fingerprint magnet, as is the back of the tablet, so you will need to carry a small tablet cloth with you to keep it clean.  The hard drive is limited in size, but should be adequate if you will be using this computer for word processing, spreadsheets, email, etc.  Battery life while playing  a movie, browsing and doing some email and work processing was about 4.5 hours.  Not too bad.  The charger cord is a short USB cord with a separate wall unit.  You will need a longer USB cord if you want to have the tablet plugged in while using it.  The computer comes with Microsoft Office and a smattering of Asus applications.  If you are looking for an affordable, responsive, easy to use tablet computer that has Windows 8, this Asus has been very impressive."}

While you can see all the good things it gives you from other customer reviews, I will address a few issues.  I would regard the charger as defective, it can't charge the tablet while I am using it, and will take extremely long time to finish charging after.  I first tried to delete ASUS web storage and updated BIOS as other people suggested on various user forum, but it doesn't seems to help much.  I bought another micro-usb charger and there is no more charging problem.  Another imperfection is that the screen is an absolute fingerprint-magnet, which is not really a big deal to me.  The dock keyboard's key size is also a bit tiny and cramped, while the touchpad is slightly too large in my opinion.  Nevertheless, with such decent spec and international warranty, this machine is well worth the price and I still love it."}

Although initially leery, I came to enjoy the Windows 8.1 operating system. Not nearly as many apps as Apple or Android have, but with the full desktop and ability to pin Web pages to the Start view, that never bothered me.\n\nIt worked well for about a week and a half. One day it took a few presses of the power button to turn on, but I thought nothing of it. A couple of days later, I powered the unit off and plugged it in to charge overnight. The next day, it would not power on. Plugged, unplugged, docked, undocked--nothing worked. Eventually, the power button became stuck under the bezel. This leads me to believe that the hardware worksmanship is lacking, which surprised me because my Asus netbook from 2007 still boots up without a problem.\n\nAsus tech support asked for all details via an email form and then did nothing other than give me a phone number to call so I could go through all the rigamarole again. Frankly, it's easier to send the thing back, which is what I'm doing."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "Personally i really like this laptop.  But the reason I really like it is that I don't use it much.\n\nWhat i really wanted was a fully functional Win 8 transformer that i could use at work.  I wanted it to be responsive and not lag too much.  I also wanted to be able to type on it as needed.  Lastly I wanted it to run all day on a single charge.  It does meet all these criteria, however a few of the functions aren't that good:\n\n1) The mousepad is really bad.  I mean it's barely usable.  This isn't so awful because the screen is touch enabled but the screen also does not always register touches.\n\n2) The system lags sometimes.  It isn't terrible but it is bad enough to be annoying.  If you're used ta a very responsive Android device you're going to notice the lag.\n\n3) The app store is laughable...there are almost no Win 8 apps.\n\nOn the upside:\n\n1) It is a truly fully functional Win 8 device.  No limitations--anything you could install on a desktop you can install here too.\n\n2) The screen pops off easily and you have a tablet.\n\n3) The screen is nice, sharp, bright and clear\n\n4) It comes with MS Office which is obviously nice.\n\nOverall I'd say this is a good limited use device.  i don't think you'd want to buy this as your primary laptop because it can be awkward to use on a lap, or in bed, etc.  However, for people who want a Win 8 device for meetings at work it's great.  You'll be able to do things like install Skype, or GoToMeeting or anything at all that works on Win 8.  It also has a very long battery life so you don't have to worry about running out of juice.  The little tiny mousepad it comes with is very awkward to use and I find it very frustrating.  Also, the 'aim' on the touchscreen isn't great even after calibrating it twice.  Sometimes the screen just doesn't recognize that I touched it.\n\nSo a lot of ups and downs here.  I guess I'd emphasize once more that if you need a very portable full Win 8 machine this is a good choice even with the drawbacks.  If you don't particularly need Win 8 you may be better off with a higher end Android tablet or an iPad."}

I have been searching for a replacement for a 2010 netbook that I used as a casual \"on the couch\" handy computer.  I wanted a tablet but absolutely needed to have Office for work and other uses AND a keyboard.  As others have noted, the ASUS comes with Office Home/Student which is perfect for my needs.  I have a desktop for heavy duty work and the ASUS zenbook for travel.  (I am not a gamer.)\n\nGetting used to Windows 8.1 (because I am used to 7) is a challenge but will be worth the effort. The ASUS found my wireless printer immediately and was a breeze to connect to other devices in the house. I followed the suggestions of other users when it arrived:  I charged it fully for 8 hours.  I went thru the setup and put it on my wireless network. Next, I changed the settings so that windows would download updates automatically but not install them. I checked ASUS live updates (none were needed UPDATED--checked again the next day and installed a bios 220 upgrade without issues).  Then, I changed the settings so that the device would not go into sleep into mode (other users have had issues with the Windows updates not completely successfully or even \"bricking\" the device).  Finally, I ran all the Windows updates and kept my fingers crossed.  After about 15 minutes these were complete and the computer had restarted.  All is well.  I will change the settings back to automatically installing updates in a few days.\n\nThis device (or \"booklet\" as one reviewer termed it) is perfect for my needs (I can use as a Kindle reader and easily watch my Slingbox).  This tablet is gorgeous. I have an Android phone and was familiar with that OS.  I knew that an Android tablet would not work for me because I really needed Word and Excel.\n\nA few other reviewers found that the device worked fine at first then failed.  I will update this review in a few weeks in case of any issues.  All in all the perfect device at the perfect price.  (A quick note on tablet sleeves----the Ipad 4 sleeve (and there are many  to choose from) will NOT fit.  For $399 this was the ideal xmas present from my hubby!

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "My background: I am a graduate student. I don't like pirated software. I already had a laptop before buying the Asus t100. This older laptop of mine weighed nearly 4 kg and was a pain to carry to school. And I desperately needed a light weight computer like device through which I could create and read documents and presentations via Microsoft Office. And, I couldn't afford Microsoft Office to install in my Windows Vista laptop.\n\nAs the thanksgiving approached, I was in hunt for a tablet that fulfilled all these requirements. By some luck, I came across Asus t100 transformer notebook. I bought it in a lightning deal for $299 from Amazon.com. Here are the pros and cons from my point of view:\n\nPros:\n- It comes with a full Windows 8.1. Since this is a tablet, Windows 8.1 is really easy to use with the touchscreen.\n- It has a Microsoft Office 2013 student (Only thing the student version lacks is Microsoft Outlook which I don't use; so I don't care about it.)\n- 64 GB memory (The maximum memory the best of the Android tablets have is 32 GB).\n- The cost includes the keyboard.\n- It is very lightweight\n- It can be used both as a small computer and as a tablet.\n- The screen can be tilted when placed on the keyboard.\n- Presence of a USB 3.0 port which means that I can use optical mouse/ pen drive/ external hard disk etc\n- Micro-HDMI port is also available (But you need to buy a separate cable to use it)\n- You can take handwritten notes in the screen using the One Note application (You need to buy a separate stylus for it)\n- I love the reading mode - The screen becomes yellow (like an old, well read book - I am reminded of my well worn Harry Potter books), and that makes it much more comfortable to read.\n- Sound quality is pretty good and it produces quite a loud sound for its size.\n\nCons:\n- The screen might be a bit small (for people who like big screens)\n- The keyboard may be cramped for seasoned typists and people with big hands.\n- The touch pad is kind of small. (My suggestion is to buy a mouse)\n- The screen and the back of the tablet are fingerprint magnets (I bought a skinomi carbon fiber skin+screen guard to rectify this)\n\nI gave 5 stars for this product because this product exactly suits my needs. I am not a gamer (I don't play computer games); I am not a programmer; I am just an ordinary student. And this beauty has become my companion wherever I go. She is beautiful, talented, and understands and caters to my needs. Thank you, Asus for bringing out this beautiful product."}

Welcome to Windows Update, the tablet restarted and couldn't complete the installation and tried to uninstall the updates and as many of you unable to pass the windows boot screen. Tried to refresh and reset, nothing worked. Called ASUS and they told me there are no rescue disks for this device so in case you want to do a fresh install you cant. I am guessing doing a backup image when you start the tablet first can be helpful to restore it. ASUS help was useless advised me to send it to service or return it to the store. So I returned the tablet back its useless now.\nIf it had an option to restore to original windows I could have done that and disabled all updates.  I would buy it again because it is a good price for what you get, just making sure I have a proper backup image to restore it.\nIn case I get a new one, Ill update this review."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I originally wrote a much more generous review for this product.  In concept it was exactly what I was looking for and seemed to be the exact device for some specialized needs.\n\nThat all changed however ... shortly after opening the box.  BOTH times.\n\nLong story short it doesn't connect to the internet.  Read the other reviews around here.  It's obviously a MAJOR issue yet the company holds their hands over their ears while loudly projecting \"LA LA LA LA\".  At first I spent 45 minutes in a chat, deleting a driver, doing a factory reset, and downloading a new networking driver from the site.\n\nDay 2, we came to the conclusion that immediately after rebooting, it was back to the beginning with the device not connecting to the internet all over again.  Time for an RMA.\n\nI waited a WEEK for the RMA label I was told would be coming by U.S. Mail.  I finally called and had to pester the rep on the phone until he would e-mail the label so I could print it off.  That e-mail also NEVER arrived.  I ended up going to the FedEx store and spending nearly 45 minutes getting the defective unit shipped off using the FedEx store's rep to find this return authorization and printing off the label.\n\n10 days later I have the unit back and now it not only doesn't get online for the apps through the Start screen (just like before) but now not even IE on the desktop will browse!  NO internet connectivity AT ALL.\n\nBear in mind this is a house where at one time or another 4 different laptops, a destop computer, a wireless printer, three smart phones, and two e-readers have all connected to the router and surfed online flawlessly ... but NOT THIS ASUS!\n\nAnd just to be sure it wasn't only the network here, I took it to two airports and a local bread restaurant ... this device would not connect and browse on any of these WiFi connections.\n\nOn the last hour-plus phone call, the rep was actually taking me through the EXACT SAME ROUTINE as the very first chat.  This time I'm sure it was going to go better because ... ummm I don't know WHY.  It was absolutely brain-dead process rather than actual trouble shooting.  The rep didn't even know that Win 8 had a startup wizard which retrieved settings!  Not exactly helpful or knowledgeable assistance.  He refused to escalate the call, hung up after I held for his supervisor over 15 minutes.\n\nAll totaled, 3 chat sessions, 4 phone calls later and a trip to the FedEx store in a blizzard, (easily better than 4 hours of my time) wasted.  This unit is in a box and headed back to Amazon.\n\nSave yourself the frustration, pay more, get something that works.  Your time is too valuable to burn on this good idea which went horribly wrong somewhere in the implementation.\n\nThis experience with ASUS is not at all a motivator to make me consider another of their products.  I have NEVER had so much trouble right out of the box with any piece of hardware ... nor have I ever encountered a less competent staff \"supporting\" a product."}

I've called ASUS 3 times regarding the status of the RMA return and am having troubles getting an answer as to when the laptop will be returned. I even tried the ASUS online RMA inquiry form, but it can't find my RMA return. If you have this problem I would try to send it back to Amazon for a replacement vs. attempting to have ASUS fix it. You may also want to wait until they get the bugs worked out of Windows 8 on this laptop before you decide to buy it.\n\nUpdate (RMA broke!): Received the RMA laptop from ASUS on Dec 6th with the Windows OS completely re-installed. I asked them if they installed the Windows 8.1 Update that locked up the computer and he informed me they just re-installed the factory Windows OS configuration without the additional update. I asked him what I was supposed to do when the Windows update rolled out and locked up the computer again. He said it would not happen again. As a web developer I was skeptical. On Dec 10th the ASUS laptop performed the Windows update and again WILL NOT boot into the Windows OS; I only get the ASUS logo on the screen. I performed a \"system restore\" to reset the laptop back to the Dec 6th configuration and it is still locked up. This is either an issue with the ASUS T100 tablet itself or the Windows 8.1 OS.\n\nI am considering downloading a Windows 8.1 ISO and installing my own version of the Windows OS without the ASUS version of the Windows OS.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "PROS:  ASUS always makes good hardware which made my decision to purchase this product over others.  Love that this has Windows 8 (x86) not Windows 8 RT.  So this means I can install any other .exe (executable) file that would work with my desktop.  The docking keyboard is a nice feature complete with USB 3.0.  Windows 8 is a challenge to learn but once you hit the acceptance phase of Win8 your good to go.  Pretty \"zippy\" for an Intel Atom Quad processor.  Office 2013 comes preinstalled but is really hard to manage with touch, I recommend a mouse or the touchpad.  Battery life is impressive, I play games on this most of the day and use it for work and I haven't killed it yet during the day but ready for the charger when I get home.  Plays lot games, shocking I know, but do not expect BF4 or anything like that.  Got it play Plants Vs Zombies, Pain Killers, SimCity4 and a few other Steam games have worked but all graphic settings need to be on low.  Once you see the Windows Store you will be glad you got the x86 version of Windows and not RT.\n\nCONS:  Never seen Windows 8 blue screen of death (BSOD) till I got this.  Gotten it three or four times now for an IRQ conflict which is really baffling since there is hardly anything to this tablet.  The back of this bad boy get really hot when playing a game but is fairly cool when just browsing the web.  Still having a few connectivity issues, have to disconnect and reconnect numerous times.  Freezes a few times, put it to sleep and plug it in and that's all she wrote.  My biggest complaint about this is the keyboard.  No additional battery and the left and right click on the touchpad feels and sound very cheap and the touchpad flakes out for a second or two.\n\nOverall I love this thing.  I don't blame ASUS for any issues with this other the touchpad but Windows 8 is a challenge to learn.  Having x86 Windows on the go is great.  MicroSD card sticks out a bit and gets bumped outta its socket from time to time but it allows you to double your storage while on the go.  I got this and ditched my ASUS Transformer TF700 for this and I miss the simplicity of Android but this makes work easier; being able to transfer files from my work laptop, to home desktop to my T100 helps me out greatly.

Home run scored by ASUS/ Intel/ Microsoft with this device !!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "This is a great product but you need to be careful in setup in order to avoid crashing and blackouts.\n\nRecommend following steps to enjoy this wonderful device:\n\n1. Read as much of favorable and unfavorable reviews on Amazon before powering up.\n2. Fully charge before powering up.\n3. Do not do any windows update until you do #4\n4. Go to \"pc settings\" and  change windows update setting from auto install to \"download updates but let me choose whether to install them\". So much of crashing has been due to auto update installation coming off sleep mode or during booting(especially the large update right off the bat). Windows will let you know that there are updates to be installed. Now you are able to review and choose ones you want to install. More importantly, you are installing updates while the device is up and running (thereby reducing the risk of being locked out). I've had two instances of \"failed to install\" on updates during this manual installation but no crashing. When I retried to install on the next day, installation was successful in both cases. By the way, I have installed all updates so far.\n5. Asus has new BIOS update on their website - strongly recommend updating to BIOS 220\n6. Turn off three finger and edge gesture on touchpad.\n7. I use my Samsung galaxy note 2 charger with no problem. I think any Samsung or LG smartphone chargers would work. Its not any faster but has longer cord.\n8. Call Asus customer service with any issues. Generally they are helpful. If Asus recommend sending in for repair, try returning it to the retailer for exchange or refund first.\n9. Buy illumishield screen protector - your screen is no longer a fingerprint magnet.\n10. Get 64GB as 32GB is not enough.\n\nHope above helps. This is a fantastic device, doubly so at this price.\n\nUpdate:\nI've had this device for nearly three weeks with no problem whatsoever. In fact, with Windows and BIOS updates, its performance has improved. For example, the touchpad works better and battery consumption during sleep mode has gone down from 5% per hour to 1%.\n\nI have kept my windows update setting to manual installation and do not intend to allow auto installation until crashing issues are completely resolved. There is nothing to lose by taking this precaution and judging by many Windows update related crashes still being reported, this is a prudent action.\n\nUpdate 2:\nIts been nearly month and half and this devise has mostly replaced my desktop. I bought 22 inch Samsung HDTV to replace 17 inch monitor. Micro HDMI to HDMI cable connection allows me to watch Netflix while doing email, web surf, or word doc on TV screen. Simply amazing.\n\nFor the past week, I have changed windows update setting to auto installation with no issues - got tired of almost daily windows defender update.\n\nI still recommend new users to maintain manual windows update installation for the first three weeks. My daughter recently purchased Dell Venue 11 Pro (for bigger screen and slightly better spec) and got locked out after allowing automatic windows update installation. As is the case with T100, there is a large initial windows update on Dell Venue. The thing would not turn on no matter what we tried. She received a new one few days ago and needless to say, MANUAL INSTALLATION only."}

I now know why the ASUS Transformer T100TA was a top selling Black Friday device.  The tablet section is nicely constructed with an excellent screen.  The keyboard has the best tactile feeling and layout of the hybrids I sampled . Performance is also exceptional with fast boot times, instant on, and power to run multiple simultaneous applications side by side. The T100TA also includes Microsoft Office Home/Student  which competes the package and transforms this into a very capable solution for professionals and students that need functionality and portability for a fantastic price."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "This product has potential, but on the first day after delivery it crashed while doing some windows updates.  None of the standard repair/reset/restore options work, and even though I can get into the BIOS and Advanced Options Menu, there is nothing to be done, and the unit is effectively bricked.\n\nMany other users have also reported this problem, so beware, it does not seem to be easy to resolve.\n\nIn my case this was an international purchase from B&H, and because of the postage cost, there is nothing to be done and it goes straight into the dustbin.\n\nEdit : See the comments for some more feedback.\n\nI managed to refresh the OS on the tablet using a boot drive created on another Windows 8.1 computer.\n\nI still believe that Asus has some work to do on the BIOS of this product in order to improve the stability and to make it easier to refresh the OS when it gets corrupted by Windows Updates."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "This tablet is a great buy for the price, but you get what you pay for.\n\nPros-\n-it is cheap, small and light.\n-11h battery life\n-5point touch screen\n-Office 2013 Student preloaded and ready to activate (For free!)\n-2 in 1 tablet/netbook ability\n-MicroSD card slot\n\nCons-\n-Not the most powerful. Only 2 gigs of RAM (1gig used when Windows is idle) means you won't be running any intensive games, but it is enough to multitask.\n-it has a personality. It needs some time to think and process certain actions, but it is consistent so its easy to learn how best to interact with this 2 in 1.\n-USB3 is on the keyboard dock. not a bit deal, but it means you cant use a USB flash drive in Tablet mode.\n-it will probably crash on you when you first update Windows. All you have to do is do a Windows Repair if it crashes, no more problems after that. You can get to the repair mode by holding the Power and Volume Up for 5~10 seconds while the laptop is booting up.\n-finger print smudge prone.\n\nOver all I love my laptop/tablet/netbook/2 in 1 (whatever you want to call it). It is small and portable, great for things like note taking and keeping yourself entertained on long trips (like plane trips). The 11h battery life will give you between 7 and 11 hours of use. I was able to watch 3 hours worth of TV shows and play Solitaire for another 2 hours and still had 50% battery left. If you learn how your netbook behaves you can easily change a few habits to make the most out of your device."}

Ease of use.. thanks for Windows. Great specs. mini HDMI port and microUSB which also used for charging!!\nKeyboard can't used as a mainstream keyboard. You have to move your hands closer. Since it's small, you would do some typos at the begging. In facct, Keyboard could be better. But I didn't buy this for the keyboard, so it's okay."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I am deducting one star because I also experienced with my first unit what others mentioned: after the first round of windows updates the tablet no longer turned on. I am not sure the root cause of the problem  was indeed to be found in the windows updates, perhaps it was coincidence, but it did happen to me too.\nHolding my breath a bit I got another unit in replacement of the first and this is working flawlessly.\nFor me there is no comparison in what you can do with a Windows tablet and an Android or iOS based one. The latter 2 are essentially entertainment toys, and there is nothing wrong with that of course. With a Windows tablet you can also perform productivity work. Indeed I am traveling with this tablet and the included keyboard in all my business trips and so far I have not regretted ones not having taken my laptop instead.\n\nHaving said that, I also think this is without doubt the best value on the market. A very responsive Windows 8.1 tablet with inclusion of Office 2013 Home office and a detachable hardware keyboard which also works effectively as a stand and adds a full-size USB 3.0 port.\nThe new 4-core Atom processor works really a lot better than the previous iteration. This is practically lag-free and I never feel slowed down in whatever I have to accomplish on a portable device like this (of course music or video encoding is not what you are supposed to use this for).\nThe screen is very usable but not full-HD as some Android and all newer iOS tablets now offer. I have no complaints but if you see this in store displayed right next to an iPad Air the difference is noticeable. Again, this is consistent with its design. It is not as entertainment-oriented as an Apple tablet.\nSpeakers are rather good, again for the intended usage. Battery life is great, I believe I managed to use it for about 8h during my last trip.\nThe keyboard is quite comfortable, especially the keys. The track-pad buttons are, instead, way too hard and definitely unpleasant to use.\nPerhaps, in light of the first failure, the only doubts I still have concern its future reliability (hence the 4-star rating). In fact, this is the first table I bought with a 2-year replacement plan.\nI will update this review if the tablet stops performing smoothly as here described."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "On day 3 after delivery, the Book would not start windows after attempting to install windows updates.  After hours of very unpleasant telephone conversations with ASUS so called \"technical support service,\"  I have to ship this brand new Book to CA for repair.  Only if ASUS is unable to fix it, they may be so kind to replace the Book.  I bought this book as a gift and did not intend to give someone a \"repaired\" tablet or pay full price for a \"repaired\" tablet.  I'm not sure whether the issue is that the tablet is under-powered for windows 8 or whether it is purely a windows 8 issue.  Regardless, it was my first and last purchase of an ASUS product.  I would not recommend this tablet. It is cheaper than others for a reason."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "My Transformer Book arrived in mint condition and there hasn't been any problems so far.\n\nThe instruction booklet says you need to charge the laptop for 8 hours before using it for the first time in battery mode. Just plug it in and leave it plugged in while you setup the computer for the first time. The power cord is short so you'll have to sit very close to the power outlet. Buying a USB extension cable is a good idea.\n\nIt connected to my 5Ghz wireless network perfectly.\n\nIt's a little fingerprint prone, but still very sexy and sleek. The tablet screen locks very securely into the keyboard dock and it's easy to unlock it from the keyboard dock too.\n\nI'm a power user so I only bought this hybrid netbook for portability reasons. It will be great for traveling when I only need access to the internet and other light tasks. It comes with a Product Key for Office 2013 home/student version, so that's nice.\n\nThe battery doesn't charge very fast, but it does have a long battery life once it is charged. It took maybe about 6 hours to charge to 100% battery and it last about 6-11 hours on battery depending on whether you're playing an intensive game or just browsing the web.\n\nThe touchpad is average. It needs to be a little more sensitive. I went into the control panel and played with the mouse settings, but that only helped a tiny bit. However, I will be using this with a USB mouse most of the time, so its ok. Because the touchpad isn't great I ended up using the touchscreen to maneuver around and the keyboard for typing. It has a touchscreen keyboard as well. My USB mouse worked great.\nThe keyboard keys are perfectly responsive. It's a small keyboard though, so the larger your hands are the more cramped you are going to feel. However, I got used to it very quickly and stopped missing keys.\nThe touchscreen is really responsive and precise about knowing which small area of the screen you touched on a tiny menu.\n\nThis tablet has a full version of Windows 8.1 32-bit. So you can install any desktop program you want.\nThe only programs installed when you first boot are the typical windows stuff, Office 2013, and some Asus programs which are actually useful instead of bloatware. The only thing I uninstalled was Asus WebStorage. I don't need that.\n\nIt's very quick for a tablet PC, probably because of the SSD. Not recommended for heavy tasks, but still powerful at multi-tasking lots of lighter tasks. It's got an Intel Atom CPU with 4 cores. I was able to play games like Runescape and WoW on Low Detail without lag.\n\nThere's a microUSB port, a microHDMI port, microSD card slot, and an earphone jack on the side of the tablet screen. There is a full-sized USB3.0 port on the side of the keyboard dock. A microphone and webcam are built-in to the tablet. I've tested them using Skype and they work fine.\n\nJust browsing the web, the tablet barely gave off any heat whatsoever.\n\nYou do not want to work on this netbook for long hours. It's too small for lengthy work. You'd get a backache and an eyestrain. As a tablet, it's perfect for reading in bed for long hours.\n\nBuy an ethernet USB adapter if you want to plug an ethernet cord into it instead of using wifi.\n\nI'm surprised by the powerful speakers on such a small netbook. They're awesome for music and video.\n\nI'm very impressed by this tablet. Despite it's low price, it doesn't feel cheap at all. I'd actually recommend it over the much more expensive Microsoft Surface Pro 2. Asus has a winner on their hands and they're definitely going to give Microsoft some serious competition with this affordable, but high quality hybrid tablet."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "Here's why this is a better tablet/laptop than the other ones out there, in no particular order:\n1. Low price without sacrifice.\n2. Office is included, and it's not just a 60 day or one year license. It's forever.\n3. A keyboard is included free of charge. The Surface 2 keyboard will cost you $130 extra, plus you don't get the desktop version of windows with the standard Surface 2 which costs the same as the Asus Transformer Book T100.\n4. You get the desktop version of Windows. This means you can install applications from websites. You aren't restricted to apps from the Windows Store. This is a humongous selling point.\n5. 64GB hard drive space. Not 32. 64. Plus there's a Micro SD port. Grab a 64GB card from Amazon for $40 and double your storage. Micro SD cards are absolutely tiny and amazing technology.\n6. A USB 3.0 port on the left side of the keyboard. Plug in to use a wireless mouse.\n7. Detachable screen/tablet. It won't turn off when you detach it.\n8. Battery life is phenomenal. Charge all the way before powering on the first time. You can do it. Just go get a drink or something.\n9. Headphone jack. Yeah, all tablets have this. But just listing it as a feature. The speakers on this tablet are actually quite good too without much distortion at high volume levels.\n10. Mini HDMI port.\n11. It's not too small. The screen is a great size. And the keyboard... I am very tall and have large hands and fingers. I'm typing this review and making very few mistakes that require me to backspace. In fact, I typed point #11 without having to backspace once.\n12. No camera on the back reduces the price. You aren't going to be taking pictures with such a large tablet anyway since it makes you look a bit weird, so great thinking by Asus on only including a front camera for the occasional Skyping, something I really don't even do that much of.\n13. Asus is a solid brand with many years of experience. If you haven't heard of them, don't think of them as a weird brand. They are professionals. They specialize in the techiest of techy stuff. Ask that friend that helps fix your computer. He'll confirm.\n\nI may be forgetting other things. Any drawbacks are stomped on by all the things I mentioned above. They're all minor. Note that I am a verified Amazon purchaser and not someone from Asus trying to get the review score up. There's no need for that with this product anyway, as it's perfect.\n\nThis is my first tablet ever, and my first laptop in eight years. I'm highly satisfied."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "My T100TA-C1-GR came yesterday after 6pm. Having read the reviews both good and bad I knew I needed to let it fully charge. I unpacked the tablet, charger & cord plugged it in but did not turn it on. I meanwhile went to my other computer and went to the ASUS web site. I downloaded all the drivers on their site for this device and stored them on a micro sd card. Once that was done I popped the card into the charging device and didn't touch it again until I woke up in the morning. Then I held my breath and turned the thing on to find out what would happen. It booted up fine though like all initial Windows set ups for a new machine/install it took a bit. I answered all the questions and waited while Windows Update did its' thing. 19 updates later and two reboots later I checked to see if the apps I wanted to run worked the way I liked. Once I was satisfied that everything was working ok I entered the activation code for the Microsoft Home Office & Student 2013 software. I hooked up my Canon all in one printer without any issues. (The computer tablet thing spotted it on my network without any issues) I downloaded Chrome so I wouldn't have to use IE unless I wanted to. The only glitch I have encountered is that when I go to Zynga.com I can't play Farmville 2. I can play CoasterVille but not Farmville 2. I enjoy both games so I'll keep plugging at that issue & update this review if I manage to resolve it! So far (after only a few short hours of fiddling) I really like this little thing! I had an iPad for several years & it never lived up to what I wanted to do with it but then ever since my Dad introduced me to our first IBM PC XT back in 1988 with its 8 megabytes hard drive & 5 inch floppies my favorite thing to do with a PC has always been the word processor. I was never ever able to happily pound away at a word processor on my iPad and easily transfer the resulting files between devices. Pages just lacked too much to be useful & getting a file I was working on on and off the iPad was a nightmare. I love all the cloud storage this device comes with. If this thing conks out on me at a future point I'll definitely let you know but so far its great! I highly recommend to anyone who is comfortable working with Windows software.\n\nUPDATE: After doing some digging I've learned that Farmville 2 is hopeless with Windows 8.1. It is a Zynga issue not an issue unique to this device. I can play Coasterville without issue so I will wait for the Zynga fix for Farmville 2.\n\nI've managed to drain the battery completely without using it so I will make more of an effort to do the shut down process when I won't be using it for several hours.\n\nOverall I still like it.\n\nUpdate: It died completely on July 20, 2014 & no amount of fiddling has gotten it to power back on since. I found I didn't use this thing as much as I'd hoped to when I purchased it. At this point I'm checking to see if I can at least salvage the Microsoft Office but my hopes are not high for that. I've emailed ASUS and we'll see what they do but at this point I figure it's just money down the drain. I won't bother with another device like this. I like my desktop that I built myself and can maintain and update myself. This glitchy little tablet transformer thing was more nightmare than pleasure to use as time went on. I think I'll stick with Android for tablets or forgo tablets all together."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "This is a 10.1\" tablet with the capabiltities of a laptop, the battery life of an iPad and the price of a mid-level Android tablet. The screen is clear and sharp and has excellent viewing angles. The speakers are louder and clearer than any other tablet I looked at and have great stereo seperation and even a little bass, which is remarkable. It is perfect for watching movies! Battery life is superb at 10-11 hours.  It runs full Windows 8.1, the same OS as a real computer instead of a puffed up phone OS with dumbed down apps. Windows has more apps than iPad and Android combined and multiplied by 10. The latest quad-core Atom processor is quite snappy compared to any of the previous ones. It scores a 6.3 on the Windows Experience Index, just for comparison the old Atoms got a 2.3-3.3!  The tablet piece by itself is as light as the previous gen iPad. The 64 GB of memory is plenty for most and if not, you've got a micro SD slot that allows you to add another 64 GB for just $40-50. This tablet has USB 3.0 and HDMI out as well as an included keyboard that turns it into a tiny laptop. If that wasn't enough value for you, it comes with a FULL version of Microsoft Office Home & Student too, which is a $135 value all by itself. Hands down the best purchase I have made all year. NOTE: Amazon has raised the price on this, likely do to it's amazing popularity--- I bought this exact same model at Wal-Mart for $379 so shop around. This little device is an INCREDIBLE value for the money. You won't be disappointed but your iPad and Android using friends might when they see you running desktop PC level apps side-by-side with each other on a split screen. You can a Netflix movie while writing an email or posting on Facebook at the same time. Have them that with a $600 iPad. Create Word documents and edit Powerpoint presentations. Try that on a Nexus 7. Play Halo or any of the thousands of great PC games out there. Try that on a Kindle Fire. There is simply no tablet as capable, flexible and powerful as this for the money. It's no contest. The only downside to it at all is the build materials aren't exactly luxurious. It's nice enough, but the low price is evident in certain places. The trackpad is merely adequate and it's button is a bit more brittle than I'd like. I don't believe the screen is Gorilla Glass either, so take care with it. This is a good device, but if you hand it to your 9 year old kid there's a good chance it will wind up broken. Keep it in a well padded case and treat it gently and it will serve you well. Great value for under $450."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I have been looking for a windows tablet with a 10\" screen that I could afford. After seeing the reviews on this I decided to take the plunge and am very happy I did. For my usage it is just about perfect and I would change or add very little. The size and weight are perfect and the price is a steal. The screen is excellent - both videos and characters are sharp and clear. The touchpad is the first one I have ever used that works well, in fact, so well I seldom use my mouse. The touch screen as good as any of our other toys, including an LG G2 and several Fire HDs as well as a new 7\" HDX. The keyboard is excellent for my use - I am a lousy typist and use the 'hunt and peck' system. It is obviously smaller than a regular keyboard and might not be as good for an experienced typist. But, that said, this is a compact device and allowances must be made for that. The onscreen keyboard really great and large enough to use comfortably. Fit and finish are excellent although the back is a shiny fingerprint magnet as others have pointed out. It's not a big deal for me, however. I am coming from a 14\" Win 7 laptop (which has been resigned to the shelf) and it has taken me a couple of days to begin to find my way around the Win 8.1 - but the 8.1 is the 'cats meow' for me. I really like it. I had a problem signing in to my MS Live account the first day and ASUS Tech Support resolved my problem shortly. (MS tech support declined). The second day, Windows did a rather large update and after rebooting, I lost use of my touchpad. Again I contacted ASUS and they answered the phone and helped me resolve the problem - in English yet. So far, am very pleased with ASUS. With the 64GB native memory and an extra 32GB in the sd slot, I find I have plenty of memory even without the Skydrive and ASUSclouddrive .The frosting on the cake is the included free MS Office. Don't let the seemingly meager hardware specs fool you. This is a very snappy performer and does better than the Acer Aspire 14\" with a Pentium processor and 4GB memory. I have been fortunate in not having some of the problems others have reported, but this is going to be my 'all in one' device that I can use for everything that I want to do. Everyone that has seen it (including 2 iPad owners) have been very impressed - particularly when they find out the price. I could not be happier with this little jewel."}

I added a password to get into Quicken .One thing I do notice that opening accounts in Quicken is quite slow ,everything else moves along .I hate Win 8.1 I was debating installing Outlook 2007 from another computer  ,but decided to bite the bullet and bought Outlook 2013 which I now  also hate ,where is the address book still haven't found it ,will uninstall and go with Outlook 2007 .I debated using  Classic Shell which seems quite popular and get's your start button back ,but on checking further I think there could be a conflict with Windows updates .You can't win.\n12/3/13\n\nDisaster struck after my review ,again the computer wouldn't power up ,but after 20 mins did and started updating .Fast forward one day and again wouldn't power up ,called Asus (I have to say great tech support)after they walk me through a lot .nothing worked so they did a recovery for me .After recovery which took 40 mins ,it took out my Quicken and Microsoft Outlook 2007 applications & files,I also lost all my photos and quickly found out my touchpad and keyboard and mouse wouldn't work .Tech tried to bring back my drivers for keyboard and touchpad and now I had to use the touchscreen which was the only thing that worked .Folks this is a tiny screen and trying to touch places with my thick finger ,actually they're not that thick ,it's just the icons and letters are so small .One conclusion I came out with NEVER BUY TOUCHSCREEN on a 10\" computer ,it's painful .I packed up the computer and shipped it back ,so much time wasted ,3 applications removed and all my settings .This is a disaster and I had such high hopes for it .On top of that I hate windows 8.1 ,who doesn't ,and was considering installing Classic Shell ,glad I didn't I would have voided the warranty."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I got this three days ago and decided to test it out. My first impressions was that it was pretty small since this was my first 10.1 inch transformer book. I really like it since it fits what I bought it for. That's school work and small gaming. The gaming may be a bit of a stretch, but internet browser games or small games like Minecraft will work just fine. I'm sure flash player games work too. I don't mind the small keyboard, it's not that hard to get used to after you type on it for a bit. There's a game called typing of the dead. Hilarious typing game, but getting back on topic, the book takes less than a minute to get to the desktop and the touchscreen is very responsive. I have encountered some problems like the mouse tracking pad not working ( i think there's another name for this), and wifi hardware isn't working until you restart it (not too hard nor is it too long). They're not the biggest issues for me, but they're by far the only ones. In conclusion, this tablet really was worth the $417 I paid for it, even though I could've paid $300 w/o tax on Black Friday deals week. I love it, and I would recommend it to other people if you could get over the minor issues.\n\nHere are some things I noticed. (Sorry if I repeat myself.)\n1.no micro sd slot cover (in the pictures on amazon, it shows it closed with a cover, but i can't find one for mine)\n2.mousepad doesn't always work for some strange reason(use regular mouse instead)\n3. charges pretty slow but it has a 11 hour battery life, so it's normal\n4.touch screen is very responsive\n5.keyboard is okay after you get used to it, quite small though\n6.gaming wise, it's not bad\n7.nice finish on keyboard on the left and right of the mouse pad\n8.the clicks on the pad are quite loud\n9.haven't figured out how to use the \"number pad\" in the keyboard\n10.one usb port isn't really enough for me, so i recommend getting a 4 port hub from amazon preferably a usb 3.0 one\n11.can play 1080p videos without any problem\n12.sometimes the wifi doesn't work, but after restarting it, it starts working again\n13.a good laptop/tablet for casual usage\n14.need to get a mini hdmi- hdmi adapter or cable to use on other stuff like a monitor/projector\n15.good lock between the tablet and keyboard\n16.windows button on the side is kinda cool but pointless with the keyboard imo\n17.nice microsoft office 2013 included\n18.okay packaging\n19.there's a code on the bottom of the keyboard and that's the model number for asus webstorage\n20.the stickers on the left side of the pad seem to be croquette, just noticed it and bothers me a bit\n21.the typing isn't that hard once you get used to it ( coming from a mechanical keyboard user)\n22.i like to use the transformer book without the keyboard usually\n23.can't figure out how to use google chrome without the windows 8 google chrome version, doesn't bother me but preferred\n24. Windows 8.1 takes some  time to get used to. I personally like it since it's easier to open things.\n25.camera is okay... don't know if it can be used as a webcam yet since i haven't tried it out yet\n26.nice quad-core processor, uses very little power\n27.got some benchmarks from games\n2013-11-30 00:01:49 - javaw\nFrames: 17127 - Time: 600000ms - Avg: 28.545 - Min: 13 - Max: 41\n2013-11-29 17:07:18 - javaw\nFrames: 2670 - Time: 60000ms - Avg: 44.500 - Min: 18 - Max: 63\nI'll be sure to update that list of games once i start downloading other games"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I'm a mid 30s adult returning to college.  I have a gaming desktop but wanted something I could carry around and do school work on as well.  I bought the $250 Samsung Chromebook.  While I love the idea of the chromebook, it didn't fit all my needs.  I still prefer MS Word over Google Docs.  I could have used Libre Office in Dev mode or Office 365 for a monthly fee.  I didn't want either of those options.  I also wanted to play some of my lower end Steam Games which was impossible on the Chromebook. Any school software that requires an install also won't work, but I knew that beforehand.  Luckily, I didn't have any of those problems.\n\nI had some minor surgery this past week and decided to try out the T100 while confined to the bed. Turns out I really love it, and I have decided to use it as a replacement for my school laptop/tablet.  I'll try to point out some Pros and Cons below.  Let me start by saying that out of the box I did a full charge, which took several hours.  Initially I just installed Google Chrome and Google Drive along with uninstalling Asus's online storage backup software.  Perhaps something didn't play right, but I had plenty of problems with downloading any Windows Store apps after that.  They would hang in pending status.  I did research and tried several online suggestions. I finally reset the PC and decided not to uninstall the Asus bloatware.  Second go round everything was smooth.\n\nPros:\n*Free Dock - Some people complain about the quality or small size.  I tried to lightly bend the dock and it would not give.  I saw online videos of people who had docks with a slight give.  Mine did not at all.  Maybe I got lucky or I got a batch with better quality, no idea.  All I know is my dock is sturdy.  It took me less than 30 minutes to get used to typing on it.  I also have pretty small hands for a guy, so maybe that helped.  So far I haven't had any trackpad issues either.  It is hard to press it down, but then again I don't use that function.  I just use tap gestures and it works for me.\n\n*Windows 8.1 - I can install Steam and play Civ5, Torchlight 2, FTL, and several other simpler games without issues.  This is a nice bonus for a small machine that isn't meant to be a gaming beast. (On a side note, WS has several great games...Halo Spartan Assault, Game Dev Tycoon, 4 Elements II, Radiant Defense, Gunpowder and many more.)\n\n*MS Office - This is a big deal.  Originally only the RT devices came with office.  Now this 8.1 tablet/laptop has full Home/Student office.  Can't get much better than that, $140 software value.\n\n*Overall build quality - It's not a 5 star quality build, but is great for the price.  The back is sturdy, no bending or flexing on my device.  I know some had said their version had flex but mine does not.  It feels solid.\n\nCons:\n*Keyboard - Even though I listed the dock as a positive the actual keyboard is not as nice as my cheaper Chromebook.  The build quality was good for me, just typing wasn't as nice as the Chromebook chiclet keyboard.\n\n*Smudge city - This thing is a finger print magnet.  I wish the back would have been matte.\n\n*4-5hr charge time - The included cable is tiny.  You'll want to purchase at least a 5 foot cable and charger separate.  It's ridiculous they even include such a joke of a charging cable.  I wish this thing charged as fast as the Surface tablets 1.5-2 hr full charge, but sadly you'll have to do a full charge over night.\n\nConclusion:\nFor a student or someone wanting a tablet that can serve as a cheap functioning laptop, then I think this is a great choice.  I've had no stuttering in games or videos that I've played.  You get full MS Office.  I would encourage you to buy a better charger and a 64gb sim card.  Install your Steam client or any other windows software to the sim card.  Whatever you install off the Windows Store will use the SSD.  So don't waste SSD drive space on stuff you can put programs you can install on a sim card."}

Sometimes it works, then the next time you use it the connection simply never makes it.\n\nThe tablet is slow also and doing simple things will often lock it up.\n\nNo USB connection either, so you will need to get an adapter. It does not come with one.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nThis ASUS is simply not going to work. I wound up buying a new Dell Touchscreen with a bigger screen. It has two actual USB ports and a separate plug in for charging. Everything works great on it.\n\nAs for this ASUS cheapo, it's just sitting on the shelf for now, doing nothing."}

Even now I can't believe how can such a great tablet/computer with installed Windows 8 and the Microsoft suite (excel, powerpoint......) be so cheap. I thought there must be some catch in it but now that I am using it I know there is none. Finally a tablet that works like full featured computer, where I can write documents, prepare presentation and analyze my data the same way I would on my laptop! I love the design and color as well. Keyboard is beautiful, I have no problems typing and it feels very nice to touch. I wonder how can other companies (Microsoft, Apple, HP, Lenovo...) be offering similar or less quality products (with less features) for price 2 or 3 times as big!

The screen is smaller than my Nexus 10, and when I display a magazine page on the Asus, it is smaller than on my Nexus and harder to read.  It is not just the clarity of the text, the text size is also smaller.  For the price, it is a great laptop and I will get be getting rid of my Samsung laptop and use the Asus when I travel.  But I use my Nexus primarily to read e-books and magazines and the Asus does not do magazines well enough for me to think about replacing my Nexus with the Asus.  If Asus had just had a little more width to their screen so magazines displayed correctly, I would of given it 5 stars."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I would like to preface this review by stating I have never actually been able to use this product.  I have now order two of the Asus Transformer books with windows 8.1.  Both of them have been defective and unable to turn on.  I purchased this product because of the high reviews.  I am sure most of those who received this product and were actually able to turn it on are pleased.\n\nI was very excited when I received my first unit.  I carefully removed it from it's packaging and followed the very simple instructions on how to start the Transformer book up for the first time.  The instructions recommend waiting at least 8 hours before using in battery mode.  This was okay as I had it plugged in and wasn't going out any time soon, I just wanted to get the initial setup complete.  However, the only reaction from the device was an orange blinking light.  There was no response from the power button.  Turns out after calling Asus, the orange blinking light is a battery malfunction indicator and the product would have to be sent in for repairs.  I promptly returned it to amazon and had a replacement shipped.\n\nWithin two days the new Asus Transformer Book had arrived.  Once again I could hardly contain my excitement.  The device looks and feels great, and I couldn't wait to use it!!  Once again I followed the instructions which are very simple. (plug device into keyboard, plug power cord into adapter, plug power cord into tablet, plug into power outlet, turn on)  This time the light remained solid orange!!!  The device was successfully charging and in no time I would begin the initial setup.  I let it charge for a few minutes before attempting to turn it on.  As I pressed the power button I heard a small click.  The next thing I know the power button is recessed into the tablet, and doesn't pop back out and the orange charging light turns off.  The power button was stuck, and the Asus transformer book, much like the first unit I received, is now an expensive paper weight.\n\nI was devastated.  I called Asus, and was told the only thing they could do is have me send it to them for repairs, but I should expect to wait for 3 weeks or so.  I am beginning to grow impatient and do not want to wait that long.  I once again file with Amazon for replacement, only this time Amazon is out of stock.\n\nI still want the device!!!  I really do, the third time is supposed to be the charm.  I even purchased a nice case for it. However, I want it for the original price I paid for it at $350.00 for the 64 GB unit.  Now it is upwards of $400, and not shipped through Amazon.  I will try to contact Amazon to check if there is anything they can do.\n\nOverall I am extremely disappointed with my experience so far, but am willing to give it one more shot.  At $350, if this device can actually do what it says, then the Asus Transformer Book is an amazing deal.  However, I'm beginning to think that this is possibly a deal that is too good to be true..."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "UPDATE 2 - Someone suggested I update the bios from Asus. So I did, and the power button is much better now. Why it wasn't like this from the start, I don't know. But back too my original 4 stars. This thing is nice, but a tad quirky. But I'm connected to my TV via Miracast now, and it's pretty cool. Such is the way of new toys sometimes. Not all the kinks have been worked out.\n\n***UPDATE*** - Reduced rating to 2 stars because the power button is VERY problematic.  Can't get it to turn the PC on 90% of the time. May have to call Asus about a repair.  It's a simple concept: if you can't turn it on, then it's useless. In fact, as I type this, I realize I have to just give it 1 star.  Shame, as this had so much promise.\n\nBack to the original review.....\n\nAsus is really measuring up to be a great laptop. I've been a fan since the motherboard days, and am really starting to like them over Toshiba, as my go-to laptop brand. I have an&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/ASUS-A55VD-AH71/dp/B009M2XB6M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">ASUS A55VD-AH71</a>, and am quite impressed with it, because its got a lot of punch, and is one of the few economical laptops out there that still has a physical graphics card.  This Transformer Book can't hold a match to that, but for a budget tablet/laptop, it's pretty amazing. Unfortunately, it's got a lot of hiccups too.\n\nIs it a Tablet or a Laptop?\n\nBOTH! That's the coolest thing about this little guy -- it's a full-fledged touch-screen laptop, that detaches from the keyboard to transform into a tablet! Cool to say the least.  The footprint is basically 10.25\" x 6.75\" and about .75\" thick with the keyboard attached.  To detach and use in tablet mode, just push the lock button on the keyboard and remove the screen -- voila - instant tablet.  The screen reattaches quite easily and locks into place, so I can literally pick up the whole thing by the screen if I want, and the 2 parts stay securely attached.  The build feels rock solid; it doesn't feel like it'll break apart accidentally, and the 2 parts lock together and feel like one solid unit when attached. Very nice.\n\nWelcome to Windows 8 in it's Natural Habitat\n\nLike most people, I wasn't all that fond of Windows 8 when I first tried it.  It's not that the OS is bad or anything, it's just a big departure from the Windows we used to know.  Plus, Windows 8 was designed to be touched, so unless you're using it on a touchscreen laptop, then it's just cumbersome and awkward.  I ended up tweaking Win 8 on my main Asus laptop to run more like Win 7, and I'm much happier with it that way on that particular computer (non-touchscreen.)  But on this Transformer Book, Windows 8 is kinda dreamy.  I'm really falling in love with it within this context -- on a touchscreen device, where it was made to shine.  Windows 8 was meant to be swiped and touched, not clicked to death with a mouse or touch-pad.  Frankly, Microsoft shot themselves in the foot with that one -- a touchscreen device should have been mandatory for Windows 8, and that OS should NEVER be installed on a non-touchscreen device. It's just not meant to be used that way.  My opinion of Win 8 has improved 100-fold, now that I finally see it in action, the way it was meant to be used -- all touchy-feely.\n\nFingerprint Magnet\n\nCosmetically, this Transformer Book is very attractive; sleek, chic and modern. The downside though, is it attracts fingerprints like crazy. The high gloss lid is beautiful, so long as you never touch it. But the minute you lay fingers on it, it shows every smear and smudge, and quickly looks like crap.  The touchscreen is no better. I have a new Kindle HDX, and I don't know what Amazon did to that thing, but no matter how many times I poke and touch it, I'm hard pressed to find any fingerprints on the thing. I mean, I really have to try hard to make a single smudge or smear.  This Transformer, conversely, could pick up fingerprints from an imaginary friend. The screen on my friend's iPad always looks like that too, and I never want to touch it because of that. I turn into Howie Mandel in that moment, inspecting every smear and smudge, imagining these touchscreens to be breeding grounds for every virus and staph infection known to man.  Not a very attractive feature of this otherwise beautiful laptop. I'm constantly wiping this thing down, even after just a few minutes use; it's just that bad.\n\nThe Netbook Reinvented\n\nRemember those little netbooks that were virtually useless for anything but checking email? Well, that's what this reminds me of, only this time, it's actually useful.  This is a full-fledged Windows experience here, not a glorified email device.  So in that regard, you can do anything on this Transformer Book that you can do on a regular laptop.  Well, almost. It has no disk drive, so you're limited to downloadable software only. No one's gonna load Adobe's Production Suite onto this thing. But a cloud version of Photoshop might be interesting.\n\nCloud Based Software\n\nClearly that's the direction we're all headed.  Microsoft Office has already gone there, and the OS is soon to follow.  In the not too distant future, software piracy will become near obsolete, since everything will be based in the cloud; including our own documents. But the upside to that, is it should cut down on viruses, piracy and the dreaded system wipe and re-install that we've all had to suffer through on occasion.\n\nMicrosoft Office Included\n\nEverything except Publisher, from what I can tell.  Comes with a 1 user license product key in the box.\n\nUSB Recovery Disk?\n\nThis comes with a USB flash drive in the box. It's very nice and chic looking, but I can't get any of my computers to recognize or read it.  I'm assuming it's a recovery disk in case the computer ever crashes.\n\nDon't Be Fooled\n\nYour standard Android or Apple tablet is very easy to use.  Nary a software update or any real knowledge required.  This Transformer Book is great, since you get the best of both worlds -- tablet and laptop. But just don't become complacent, thinking you're using a run of the mill tablet. It's not. This is a full-fledged windows PC that can be used like a tablet.  But it's still Windows in all it's glory -- and with all it's security concerns too.  Be sure to install a good anti-virus or security suite, and keep it updated.  Don't fool yourself into believing you're using an innocent little tablet.  I like having the full throttle power of a Windows machine in tablet form, I just gotta remind myself to remember that it's a full Windows experience, and not just a glorified toy, like other tabs.\n\nThe Hiccup List:\n\nNice as this laptop is, there are some serious hiccups that make it feel more like a work in progress, than a fully realized idea. Here they are:\n\n> Wonky Power Button - Sometimes, I just can't get it to power this darn thing on! Or off! I just keep pressing and pressing, and nothing. Then suddenly, it works. I don't think it's broken or anything, just really finicky with how it likes to be pressed. Not a deal breaker, just a pain in the arse.\n\n> Near System Failure on Updates - as is always the case with Windows, there's a crap load of updates required right outta the gate. Asus even has a few of their own.  Problem is, once all the updates were done, it naturally wanted to reboot -- and it almost never turned back on! I almost thought I was gonna have to call tech support, because it looked like the thing had flat out died. It got stuck on a black screen for half an hour and wouldn't reboot. So I had to repeatedly futz with that wonky power button and forced about half a dozen reboots, which was a real pain, to say the least.  After several glitchy reboots and jittery screens, it did finally sputter back to life. Not sure what the issue was, but it seems to be working fine now.\n\n> Crappy Charging Port - it's got a micro USB charging port, and a nice compact charger. Only problem is, I really have to futz with it just to insert the charging cord.  It really doesn't go in very easily at all and is a real pain to work with. Huge design flaw IMO.\n\nBottom Line - this is a fantastic little laptop, hiccups and all. I mean, I wouldn't use this as my one and only computer. But as a portable solution, this is about as good as I imagined something like this could be. LOVE how it easily transforms from a laptop to a tablet. LOVE Windows 8 in this touchscreen environment.  And LOVE the combination of portability and power.  This is the future of tablets and laptops right here, and both Android and iOS have something to be seriously worried about.  The Goliath is back in the room, and it's called Microsoft.  And now with touchscreen laptops creeping into the market, they're in prime position to keep their grasp on the market.  As far as the hiccups, I'm sure Asus will fix them over time, but for now, it's not a totally problem free experience.  Overall, this is a solid little laptop, and minus the glitches, it works as good as my budget Toshiba Win 7 i3 laptop. This is ideal for a life on the go; be it travel, work or fun.  I'm very impressed with this little guy, and excited to see where this is all going.  Quite impressive, even with the few glitches."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "Initial review: 11/30/13. Owned for 2 weeks now. This is not my first Windows 8 experience. Windows is up to 8.1 at the time I received the product. It works quite well. I'm already familiar with Windows 8, so the learning curve is not as steep, but this is the first touch experience I've had with the OS. Windows and the processor work well together. No noticeable lag in routine actions like pulling up the tiles. Normal use is on par with other tablets (such as browsing, email and Google type searches). Google has an app finally and it's as smooth as the iOS version of Google Now.\n\nThe keyboard is what is expected of a convertible. A tad small, but that's the sacrifice you make to get a full keyboard on a tablet sized device. The touch pad and associated mouse keys leave something to be desired, even from a tablet type keyboard, but a little time learning how to use the touch screen will negate those problems. On a personal note, I don't really even like touch pads, so I would rather have a larger keyboard without the touch pad.\n\nI have not yet tried out the camera (on Skype or the like). I am a military/government employee. I have not tried my CAC card yet, but it works on my Windows 8 desktop, even in Chrome as of the time of this review. Update 1/1/14: CAC/PKI support is good in both IE and Chrome after a little fiddling.\n\nThe construction is sound, if not solid. The polished look is decent. I bought the Squaretrade warranty, so I'm not overly concerned with drops. Update 12/1/13: I've compared it to my Transformer Prime (the Android version of this tablet). This is a tad smaller than the Prime, but only when compared directly to it. On it's own it does not strike one as too big or small. The wife noted that this tablet is very light and loves that aspect.\n\nI have a wireless drive via my router, so my important documents are backed up there anyway (this setup existed before I bought the product, so no time was spent doing that). Update 12/1/13: I've tried out Skydrive. I'm as satisfied with Skydrive as Google Drive.\n\nThe power is supplied via a micro USB. I have not tried to charge it with a standard micro USB (like my Bluetooth headphone power cord), but I would not be surprised if it work, albeit slower. Update 12/1/13: Yep, charging is available through a micro USB adapter from my Bluetooth headset. Update 1/1/14: But it's slow. Like, 8 hours or more to charge using the micro USB from the Bluetooth headset. After a bit of research, 2 of the pins need to be shorted together to make a higher current, but data impaired micro USB. I recommend immediately labeling the wire with a piece of tape so that you know where the power cord is to the tablet. If you don't have the right cord, even when plugged in, you'll slowly drain the battery if the screen is on and apps are running.\n\nThe Bluetooth headset synced up with no issues, so I immediately had Bluetooth sound. I have not tried multiple Bluetooth accessories because I don't have a Bluetooth keyboard to spare.\n\nIn case you haven't used Windows 8: A complaint on Windows. Without a keyboard and in the default resolution (which is perfectly clear), the OK button in normal dialog boxes is a tad small and the text is a tad small. I'm sure I could adjust that if I dug log enough, but in touch mode, it would be nice if that was better thought out. I give the point to iPad and Android tablets for that part of user interface.\n\nOther than that Windows 8 on a tablet this size works smoothly and like it was designed for it (mostly). Tiles are the appropriate size and contain the appropriate amount of information. Mainstay programs (like Office, Internet Explorer/Chrome) work fine. Windows 8 is backward compatible on programs, so if you really wanted to (after finding a CD/DVD drive that works with it), you could load you old programs. I use Office 2013, so I didn't need to. Activeclient should not be needed, if you care. I have not installed third party virus protection yet. I have no good measure of the security features either. I suppose I'll watch the news and forums and see if Windows 8 is easily compromised. As the operating system market share becomes more even, I expect Windows based viruses to decline. I would expect that Android based ones should start to pick up. I can't necessarily vouch for iOS because I haven't tried programming anything intended for iOS.\n\nUpdate 12/1/13: I forgot to mention earlier, but since this is a full Windows OS, it does not hit the websites as a mobile device. That means that you don't need Hulu Plus to watch the free stuff. Also, the tablet does not come preloaded with Java, so you need that if you have online classes or the like. If you access work stuff via Citrix, you need to download the Citrix app from the store.\n\nThings I look forward to: A case that works well with the convertible nature of this product. Trying to use a USB item directly with the product (as opposed to through the keyboard). Trying to develop a Windows 8 program/tile."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "Rather than regurgitate other glowing reviews, I'll simply say that for the money, the 64GB version is the best Tablet/Netbook hybrid on the market with full Windows and MS Office installed. The keyboard attachment is rock solid and stays put, allowing it to be used, bounced...and possibly abused on your lap (others use some flimsy keyboard / kickstand combo..Surface..cough...ahem). Honestly, it's just silly how much you get for this price.\n\nInstall \"StartIsBack\" for a few bucks and it even feels like a Windows 7 device (come on Microsoft, did you REALLY think your world domination scheme code named Tiles would work??). Oh, and yeah, it's not all rainbows and unicorns, the mouse trackpad left/right button clicks are terrible feeling and loud enough to wake zombies.  Right shift addicts will feel gimped by the tiny shift key.  But hey, real people use real mouses (mice?) and left shift anyhow =P.\n\nThe maddeningly frustrating thing since getting this is it only charges fast with the included charger.  For those who lose the charger or think they can just use any uber aftermarket charger, most will trickle charge (and I mean TRICKLE) the device.  The included charger spits out 5V 2.1A, thus, logically, any similar 2.1A charger should work.  Right...\n\nTo understand why this is NOT the case, one apparently needs a PHD in Dumb (charger only) vs Data (sync and charger) Micro B USB 2.0 cables.  USB 2.0 standards include 4 pins, 2 for power and 2 for data transfer. If the data pins are \"shorted\", your device knows it's connected to a charger only and will pull the max power it can.  If the data pins are not shorted in the charger and/or cable, how much power your device draws will depend on how \"smart\" it is.  If it's a bit challenged in the IQ department, your device will probably thinks it's always connected to a usb port for data transfer/sync and self limit it's power draw to 500mA (0.5A).  The T100TA apparently is in this \"dumber\" category and 500mAh will be like trying to charge a Nissan Leaf with a regular wall charger and patiently waiting like 6 months or something.\n\nMy guess is the included T100TA wall charger is shorting the data pins, whereas many aftermarket chargers and MOST cables keep all 4 pins open. I thus provide THREE solutions for your charging woes:\n\n1) Get a 5V 2.1A wall charger that shorts the 2 data pins (I can't find) or is \"smart\":\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Innergie-mMini-AC15-Power-Adapter/dp/B005JZP3IU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Innergie mMini AC15 Power Adapter</a>\n\n2) Get a USB adapter that shorts the 2 data pins to make any charger and cable (car, wall, etc) \"dumb\".\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/PortaPow-Fast-Charge-Blackberry-Charging/dp/B00GC4AJOU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">PortaPow Fast Charge Blackberry Charging</a>\n\n3) Get a cable that shorts the 2 data pins to make any charger (car, wall, etc) \"dumb\".:\nPortaPow Specialised Cord\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/B0088HTYUE/dp/B0088HTYUE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">B0088HTYUE</a>"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "This is a great product at an even better price, with a few things slightly holding it back.  The battery life and performance is fantastic for any laptop, but truly amazing for such an inexpensive one.  It functions well as a tablet also, but is a little awkward in portrait mode given the widescreen aspect ratio.  Windows 8.1 is a remarkable operating system that functions well in both the multi-touch and laptop modes.  Also, it's easy to choose this over the Surface RT as it offers full Windows 8.1.  This means you can run full desktop applications and gives you access to desktop services such as Steam, iTunes, and Spotify (without paying for the premium verison).  This is a huge advantage over the iPad or Android tablets as well.  Plus, unlike other tablets, Windows devices run the full desktop version of the web including flash video and animations.  It even has the full version of MS Office (Home and Student)!\n\nMy only criticisms would be the \"just okay\" build quality and cramped keyboard.  I also wish the performance was a bit better for desktop apps and games, but it's acceptable given the low price. Finally, the tablet apps available in the Windows store are lackluster, but that should improve with time.  With a few refinements in the future, I think this will be a near perfect all-purpose device that is awfully close right now!"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I used to buy iPad only, but after Windows 8.1 I changed my mind. I have many iPads at home for my 7-year-old for the learning and entertainment purposes. However, I wish I could buy a notebook, both for my son and myself for productivity and project purposes, that can last the whole day without charging in between. And I've looked around the market for 2 years, today I finally found it at a very reasonable price point. I bought ASUS VivoTab one month ago and tested all sorts of functionality. It has been doing good, but not excellent. My son installed Minectaft Computer Version and it was running so slow that he couldn't even play it at all in the most desktop environment of Java Runtime/Virtual Machine.\n\nOne month later now it comes to the market this little cute ASUS Transformer Book t100. To make sure its computing power, I went to Best Buy yesterday first to install Minecraft with Java and it runs perfectly smoothly, which means you can count on this tiny \"Netbook\" to do heavy-duty gaming or graphical design. At this price, you buy the fastest tablet in the marketplace, which sounds like a steal.\n\nAnd also, the full function keyboard can make you productivity suite run perfectly on the most portable machine. I've tried to buy a bluetooth keyboard and a bluetooth Mouse for my past ASUS VivoTab Smart ME400C, but it's very awkward and the bluetooth connection often lost from time to time. So, I decided next time I would like a tablet with the Original-But-Not-Bluetooth-Connection Keyboard.\n\nAnd this is it - ASUS T100, which is a fast computer even faster than my wife's working computer Thinkpad, with a free office pre-installed. Also I did a deep research and found 1080p is not good for Wireless Display function. 1366x768 resolution makes Wireless Display function work perfectly since 1080p Miracast Wi-Fi connection often drops due to several times larger real-time network data transfer than in the 1366x768 mode.\n\nTry to think, when you get in your office, your monitor, full-sized keyboard and mouse will be wirelessly connected to this fancy little cutie automatically; When you walk in a presentation room, you can use the big TV screen mounted on the wall in the mirroring mode as a second screen, wirelessly or via and HML-to-HDMI cable. When you go back home, your kid can unplug the keyboard to play Windows-Specific tablet games or just leave the original keyboard plugged to play tons of Legacy Online Java-based Learning Games.\n\nAt this price, basically you got a so-far-the-fastest tablet, a free original keyboard, a free Office, sounds too good to be true. Actually, in terms of Wireless Display function, I got a better notebook on ASUS t100 even than my 14\" HP notebook with an I3 core, because my I3 HP hotebook processor can't support Wireless Display function at all.\n\nAfter I placed this order, I went to eBay buying a Samsung Pro 64GB micro SDXC for just a measly $21, then I got 128GB tablet+keyboard+Office in total so that I can download any youtube kids learning stuff as my son wants. For iPad Air at 128GB with a keyboard, you have to pay more than $1000, but it's still a toy, not as open as in the Windows Legacy platform. But this ASUS t100 can get my Word, Excel and Powerpoint jobs done on the go with my Verizon LG G2 phone's hotspot function anywhere anytime.\n\nWithout Microsoft's distressed support, ASUS can't release a good product like this, because Microsoft is spending $400 million promotion to sell 16 million tablets like this over this holiday season. Compared to iPad Air, you only pay 1/3 price but can strike a good balance between home entertainment and work productivity.\n\nBy the way, don't think the highest screen resolution is boon for customers all the times: I bought iPad 3 and it stutters once for every 5 minutes or so lasting almost an entire year and then Apple upgraded iOS three times I feel better, but after Apple forced me to upgrade to iOS 7, my iPad 3 stutters again now. I dug into the stuttering reason, I found it's the GPU/CPU A6X computing power issue, because iPad 3 uses 2048x1536 resolution, but its GPU is too slow to support, it can only run games at less than 30fps at ~17fps, making the stuttering issue happen all the time from day one. And Apple's Lemon Design has damaged Apple's reputation a bit and Apple has dumped iPad 3 like S***, making it the shortest-lived product in Apple's history.\n\nThe only downside is the touch pad works not good enough. Because notebook at this small form factor, ASUS has combined two touchpad keys into one piece: this makes touchpad work stickily. You can try to lift your thumb higher to not touch he touchpad when you use your index finger to move the cursor around. Or you just plugin a USB mouse to solve this issue forever.\n\nAlso, the full-sized USB port is very useful since past microUSB port can't read normal USB portable hard drive because tablet microUSB has no power output to power up a normal mechanical drive. Now, I'm waiting Intel-powered next generation phone so that Microsoft can combine Windows, RT and Phone three together into one product. By then, I guess within a few years, your phone will have a computing power simply as powerful as a desktop so that you can carry your pocket super computer anywhere anytime with a 24/7 wireless connection.\n\nTo cut the price tag down, ASUS did cut a lot of functions: compared to past version Vivotab Smart, it lacks rear camera and many sensors like NFC Gyro... All in all, this will become ASUS's next Nexus 7 blockbuster, consolidating its No. 3 position in the tablet world in the global market."}

I had a good out-of-the-box experience. Performance is faster than I expected. Battery life is great. Good solid keyboard and a real hinge to I can use it as a laptop. Very light - especially off the keyboard and light enough to read a book in bed. The quality of the speakers is surprisingly good. Instant-on really works. And this is a real PC so all my Windows apps work fine. Amazon Prime movies play and look great (which is not the case with my Android tablet).\nOnly real downsides are I would have bought one with a larger SSD if it was available and it would be nice to have an LTE version as an option to be always connected.

Touch screen is nice for touch and feel and responsiveness. Has a microSD and mini HDMI port unlike most tablets.\n\nCons are that some keys are hard to hit because they are in an awkward position, like the upshift key. Always end up hitting the caps lock instead. Keyboard is quite usable however it is small enough to feel like my wrists will be sore after about fifteen minutes of typing due to the angles. Ok for short docs but I wouldn't want to do a 20 page paper on this without using an external keyboard.\n\nAlso its a Microsoft machine so they want you to sign in to your Microsoft account to use just about any app on the T100. Drives me nuts. No I don't want to sign in just to see a calendar, thank you very much, and I don't want to store my Word documents on the 'cloud' or anywhere other than my own device, which fortunately, is still an option.\n\nContrary to what I previously thought, MS Office is included, which has Word, Excel and Powerpoint. The Microsoft Key is in the box. Good thing I didn't throw that out. This takes the T100 out of the realm of 'toy' and into the area of 'usable light weight low power cost saving work machine'.

It comes with the keyboard dock and a full license for Microsoft Office Home and Student edition (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and One Note). Those two items alone would add several hundred dollars to the cost of other tablets.\n\nThe system has adequate power thanks to a quad core Intel Atom processor. It's not going to be anywhere nearly as powerful as some of the i7 based Ultrabooks out there, but it certainly can keep up with just about any productivity app run on the device. I found it can run tablet games exceptionally well and is capable of running older PC games like Portal and Half Life 2. Newer games will struggle a bit.\n\nI am not crazy about the keyboard. The keys are chiclet style and are slightly smaller than the full size keys one might find on some laptops. I also don't like the smaller shift key on the right side of the keyboard.\n\nThat said Windows 8 is a better computer operating system than a tablet operating system. I've found computing tasks to run exceptionally well on here, but things I use a tablet for (like content consumption) don't function as well as an iPad or Android tablet might. Of course Androids and iPads don't do productivity applications as well as this tablet does.\n\nMy last gripe is with the 16:9 screen.  It is fine for doing work in its landscape orientation attached to the keyboard but I've found it to be too tall and narrow when placed in portrait orientation.\n\nBut for those in the market for a Windows tablet that runs real Windows software, this is probably the best one out there at the moment."}

It is VERY difficult to use left and right click without moving the mouse at the same time.  I have written to ASUS about the touch pad and the reply was - that is the design.  The touch pad design makes this machine far more difficult to use in keyboard mode than any other of the many laptops I have experienced.  If ASUS would fix the dumb design of the touch pad, this 2 in 1 would indeed be a great machine.  I reduced my rating from 4 to 3 stars.  It would be 5 stars with a good touch pad.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGreat 10\" machine, fantastic at the Amazon price - mine was $349.  I don't understand why some of the reviewers have negative comments about Window' s 8/8.1 - this reviews the PC not Windows.  I have been using this PC for a few days.  It has completely replaced a 10\" NoteBook, an iPad 1 and a Kindle Keyboard.  This PC does all those functions really well.\n\nI won't repeat the comments many others have made.  I am really happy with this purchase.  Two features need improvement.  The right shift key is difficult for me - I am a hunt and peck typist, and I frequently mistakenly hit the Enter key.  The touch pad is hard to use for me.  The mouse moves when the click area is touched.  It is really hard to position the mouse on a small target and keep it there while I click.  Using a Logitech mouse works very well.  I disabled most of the Asus Smart Gesture options.  The touch screen works very well, much better than the iPad 1 I was using.  I prefer a stylus over my fingers.  Having almost every action available as a touch or as a click is really flexible.\n\nBottom line - a wonderful, small, portable, multi-purpose device.  And the fact that it runs Windows 8.1, making it totally compatible with my desktop is just plain terrific.\n After struggling with an iPad and a Windows desktop for almost 2 years, this PC allows me to forget the frustrations of trying to use an Apple tablet with a Windows PC.

I'm upgrading from an old 10inch Dell Inspiron netbook, and wanted something lightweight to take with me on my daily train ride.  I originally had my eye on an Acer Iconia 10inch tablet, but was having trouble finding one as they seem to have disappeared from the market.  I am really impressed with this Asus.  As far as I'm concerned, I haven't found anything better for the price, and it comes woth Office, the \"full\" windows 8.1, not RT....64gb memory, plus complimentary cloud storage on Skydrive AND with Asus.

When you register your tablet with their site, you'll understand what I mean.  I hope I never need their technical service!  The included charging adapter got exceptionally hot when charging the tablet, and I wasn't using the tablet while it was charging.

It shows they are actively involved in trying to take care of their customers. And I think the ASUS rep is right - the hotel I was in when my T100 died had spotty wireless connections, and the download simply got hung up on update 8 of 13. After resetting connections on 3-4 different wireless channels all through the hotel without being able to re-engage the updates, I tried to shutdown and reboot, and that's when the trouble all started. I was speaking with an IT technician at my office today and he also said Windows updates don't use download manager software that is available for more robust downloads.\n\nBack in the 1980's I used to download files all the time from BBS's, and the most popular download protocol was very good at handling disconnections and picking up with the download where it left off. The result was no corrupt files. Microsoft, can you please get a clue and implement this 1980's technology in your Windows Update system???\n\nUPDATE: As noted below, I hadn't tried allowing any Windows updates before I wrote my original review. I stupidly decided to trust Microsoft and allow the 13 pending \"critical updates\" to install, and they've killed this lovely new piece of hardware. It cannot boot up, cannot reach a diagnosis or repair screen, cannot access the recovery flash drive I created, etc. I've been scouring the reviews here and the ASUS T100 forum and nothing is working to recover it. As you read around you'll see this is happening to many people.\n\nIt's tempting to just blame this on the incompetence and arrogance of Microsoft, and leave my review at 5 stars. But I'm a quality engineer for an electronics manufacturer, and you know what? The software supplier is a supplier just like any hardware component, and ASUS and other laptop/tablet manufacturers ought to be reading Microsoft the riot act many times over for how they've mistreated their end customers. Is it really so impossible to develop a software update system that automatically defaults back to the prior settings whenever it can't boot up afterwards? OS updates should be bulletproof, and this sort of thing has been going on for years (as my desktop, stuck at pre-2012 updates due to similar issues, can attest.)\n\nI'll see about getting this thing exchanged and then AVOID any updates for as long as I can (like, hopefully forever). Be warned that you run a real risk of \"bricking\" your system if you do allow any updates at this point. If Microsoft wants to keep competitive with Google/Android and Apple/iOS, they really need to rethink their update strategy.\n\n************\n\nI bought this as a gift for my wife, who hates computers but needs something for email and web browsing while traveling. So I'm secretly configuring it for her as I await Christmas... and yeah, having a little fun with it along the way.\n\nWe once had a netbook about the same size that was terrible. With 8 GB of memory, the first time we turned it on, it tried to do a Windows update but failed for lack of memory. And it was slow as molasses. No, slower. Not usable. So I approached this purchase with some trepidation - would a newfangled tablet/notebook with a weaker-than-desktop processor really work? Is Windows 8.1 an improvement or would it make things worse?\n\nI'm happy to say that, well, I'm happy. Let's break it down:\n1. System startup is very fast - a few seconds. By contrast when I turn on my Win 7 desktop, I then leave and do something else for a while.\n2. The Windows 8 Start screen takes a little getting used to (for us Win 7 users), but I'm getting the hang of it and getting up to speed with how to manage and customize it. The \"win7\" style desktop is still available and used for many things. This could have made Windows 8 appear to be a mismanaged kludging of 2 very different things, but they actually work pretty well together and transfer between the Win8 screen and the Desktop screen is seamless.\n3. I am a little concerned that Win 8 is engaging in a lot more behind-the-scenes data transfer from the internet. I live in the boondocks with a Verizon hotspot for a wireless connection, which means I pay through the nose for anything over 4 GB/month of data transfer, and I'm concerned I may have trouble with that with this unit, at least until I research and turn some things off. But for most users that won't matter, and it doesn't appear to affect system performance.\n4. Speaking of which, performance has been fine. Not instant response, but not sluggish either. I'm very happy with the Bay Trail processor performance thus far.\n5. TIP: If you create a system Recovery disk for Windows 8.1 on a flash drive or micro-SD card, you have the option of freeing up 8 GB of space in the T100's eMMC drive. That's well worth it so I highly advise doing so.\n6. Graphics are very good - no complaints there either. Resolution is not terribly high, but Windows 8.1 still doesn't scale well so a 1080P or higher resolution would be unusable anyway. You can view movies at 720P on this screen, and I doubt you could spot much difference on a 10\" screen with a 1080P movie anyway. Plus, you can output to 1080P with Miracast or an HDMI cable. I did this to my 60\" TV with no problem by extending (not cloning) the computer's screen and setting the 2nd screen to 1920X1080. Very handy to display something from the tablet to the big screen in full glory.\n7. Sound is amazingly good/loud. OK, it's not a surround sound system, but I was frantically dialing down the volume the first night I turned this thing on, before it woke up my family when I tried some music.\n8. Keyboard is fine - better than I expected. The right shift that many complain about is small, but we'll learn to live with it. I'm a normal size guy and if I don't have issues, I think 95% of folks will be OK.\n9. The touchpad wins a unanimous review prize for being the big stinker on this unit. It could be better. It should be better. It looks like the rest of the unit was designed by Ph. D's, but they farmed out the touchpad design work to their grade-school aged kids. TIP: Load up ASUS Smart Gestures and disable most or all of them. This will prevent inadvertent contact with the tablet from doing obnoxious things. You use the screen as a touchscreen, not the touchpad! At any rate, I'm planning to get a bluetooth mouse for this thing.\n10. Like others, I wish the keyboard/dock housed a battery to help weight it down and provide extra life, but the battery is already very, very good, and the dock is decently heavy. I just hope they didn't add dead weight to it when they could have done a battery instead. As far as the single USB 3.0 port, adding another would be nice, but you can just buy USB dongles that have 4 or 6 ports on them and plug one in to your single USB port if you need that sort of thing.\n11. Wifi coverage has been good. I've been able to maintain a connection to my hotspot sneaking around the house at night better than with other wireless devices.\n12. Windows will ask you to set up a Microsoft account during initial use, but if you google the topic you'll find you can keep it as a strictly local account if you want, for privacy or whatever. Still, it gives access to the Windows Store, which has a growing array of apps. I expect that in a year or two no one will be complaining about a major difference between Windows 8 and Android app diversity.\n\nI've been waiting on an upcoming road trip to do some system updates and free app downloads (due to my transfer cap noted above), so I can't comment on issues people are having with any updates. I really hope they don't screw anything up, because so far I've been very happy with it. I've been able to get a variety of Win 7 software working on the tablet. I ran into a problem with MKV files and movies ripped from DVD's not playing (the IFO/VOB formatted stuff), but installing a codec pack and Win 7 Classic Media Player fixed all that just fine. So I really have nothing to complain about at this point. Besides that touchpad. (And other reviewers are right, it's a fingerprint/smudge magnet. You can't have everything.)"}

What I would say is to make sure you charge it fully before using it and then do all of the updates so you can have the best experience with this device.  I wanted this so I could check email, play some games (particularly touch enabled ones), and do some shopping on Amazon (or other sites) and it has performed beyond what I expected.  The battery life is excellent (11 - 12 hours on a charge) so no complaints there easy.  I will agree with all of the other reviews that this is a fingerprint magnet but I use a microfiber cloth and that takes care of the fingerprints with ease.  All and all, this is much more than I could have expected for the price.  Consider that they include the keyboard dock and Microsoft Office (Home and Student) and there just isn't anything else out there that can compete for the price.  I have large hands so the keyboard is small for me but usable (thinking of getting a bluethooth keyboard which would resolve that issue for me).  I would buy this again without hesitation!"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I haven't used a PC in ages. I had forgotten how much work there is to getting it to a point where you feel it is optimized to your needs. During the initial set up I didn't find windows to be too intuitive, it left my fingers scrambling just to find some menus. But after fifteen or so minutes -- I fell in love with Windows 8 (W8). Not because W8 is a looker, the tiles are kind of annoying. But because it offers a great amount of freedom, something that you truly have to work for on a Mac. W8 runs smoothly and the Asus Transformer didn't stutter as I kept tabbing up the windows, trying to cause it slow down. It finally gave way once Photoshop was opened and I started to play around with it. But normal to even moderately advanced workloads were handled without an issue.\n\nEnough about W8, let's talk about the build quality. Floored! No other way to put it. Asus' tablet doesn't feel cheap. It's not exactly high grade but you do get a wonderful feeling of stability. Snapping the tablet onto the keyboard requires just the right amount of pressure and the button releases smoothly. The keyboard is OK. If your hands are big you may have an issue; my husband grew frustrated, he's also 6'5' and has paws for hands, but I found it easy to use. The spacing is a bit tight and the trackpad ... well, there is room for improvement there, at times it just didn't work, but it was more hit than miss. As a tablet, it is more than serviceable, the screen is not the brightest, but it does offer great clarity and color. And my swipes and taps registered on their first attempts.\n\nNow, for what I really love about this tablet - OFFICE! It comes with a license, you can get to work right away on it. Just use the Office Card License that's in the box and you're good to go. I had no issues pairing up my printer with my tablet, I transferred over a few files and printed without any issues. I also wrote this review using this Transformer! The Transformer reminds me of those netbooks that were all the rage a few years back, I have two. I really liked them. They allowed me to get work done and still not be weighed down. This truly takes the netbook to another level, it's just easier; lighter and more fun to use. That has to do with the tech involved. Apps have become a necessity. Microsoft's store is lacking in that department. But there are some that are truly useful, you may find some that are just fun to have around.\n\nAsus' Transformer is a near excellent piece of hardware and a true bargain. It is a full windows device, laptop/tablet. And when was the last time you could say you actually got more than what you paid for out of a piece of tech."}

I tried all the small computers and tablets out at Staples and Asus out did them all but the price was way to high $599.99. I'm so glad I waited I love this 2-1 set up but the new key broad is not so great but you get use to it, if not you can always use a different one with it. In the last year I bought four different tablets that had great reviews and I returned them with in three days. I love watching movies on Asus from Netflix it works great better then my home HP desktop. So far I have had know problems like some have stated on here but I'm glad they posted about them just incase it could still happen to me. I'm getting use to Win 8.1 each day trying to fine all the settings to adjust things to my liking. Like most things you buy new you are told in the manual to not turn it on until you have fully charged it which is know big deal. The battery life is unreal!! I used it most of the day adjust setting, checking e-mail, web search and watched to movies and still had 84% left. Over all this is a great buy at $379.00 thinking I should get one for my son for Christmas. I didn't go into all the details about the CPU and all the great things about this because everyone else did. I do plan on calling Asus and asking them if I can use a longer charging cord because the one that comes with it is way to short and you can't put it on a table or desk and reach your surge protector so I put it on the floor to charge."}

My tablet does not recognize it at all.

Essentially, it stopped booting into anything other than a BSOD spiral after a few days.  My daughter has a Microsoft Surface and it had similar (though, unlike me, not device-fatal) problems.\n\nDo yourself a favor if you buy a tablet PC with Win 8: don't do automatic Windows Updates or firmware updates.  The problem seems to be that these updates often are applied when the device is in sleep mode and that creates a bloody mess.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "Hard to rate the hardware since my experience is so intertwined with Windows 8.1.  My experience has been filled with both satisfaction and frustration.  Starting from the beginning - I opened the package and the first instruction is to charge the tablet for 8 hours before even thinking about using it on battery power.  OK - if that is what it takes.  Then during set-up, it wanted to connect via WIFI to my router.  Since I have my router locked down with a MAC filter, I needed to find the tablet's MAC address before connecting to WIFI.  So I skipped the activation step.  The next question is how to find the IP address?  It was not on the tablet or on the box.  After doing a Google search using another computer, I finally figured the secret handshake I needed to perform in Windows 8.1 to get that information (type cmd in START, then type ipconfig /all in the cmd box).  It would have been quite helpful had that basic information been more readily accessible.  The next issue was getting a Microsoft account set up so I can access Skydrive.  I kept getting an error message saying it could not set up the account.  I spent about an hour trying to figure this out, including resetting the operating system several times thinking that there must have been something I missed in the original setup.  At my wits end, I decided to detach the keyboard from the tablet and try it again.  It worked!!  (Why????!  Note to Asus - fix this.)\n\nSo, now I am reasonably set up and am loading some other core programs that will allow me do web development, such as setting up the IIS server (consulted Dr. Google to figure this out) and loading PHP, MySQL and Dreamweaver.  The other main task I need to accomplish is to see how the tablet can and will interface with a VGA device.  Since the tablet has only a micro HDMI port, and a USB port on the keypad, I need to find a converter.  If I get that all to work, the tablet will meet my core needs - which is why I chose a Windows machine. <- Since I wrote this, it took me HOURS to get mysql, php, and Dreamweaver set up on the IIS server (note: IIS server is a Windows feature that you need to access from the Programs menu in the Control Panel).  While I am not sure exactly how I ultimately got it all to work, I think it had something to do with running the various programs \"as Administrator\" (right click the program in the START menu to see this option).\n\nSome reflections on use.  The screen is small and type is tiny.  The keyboard is cramped and the trackpad seems to have a mind of its own, but overall it is not unusable. I also wish the computer had more ports.  But the computer is soooo portable, and it is fully functional.  In sum, I am pleased with the computer, especially as I think I can probably get used to the operating system.  If you are new to Windows 8.1, like me, plan on hours utter frustration until you get to learn it.  Hard to understand why Microsoft went this route.  There are many instances where you want to strangle the engineers who designed this and did not give you a more straight forward and intuitive way of accomplishing a given task."}

Maybe the new BIOS would have changed things, maybe not, but my return window was calling and my faith in Asus dwindling.\n\nBetween all the mixed reviews (flag #2) and frustrated stories in the forums (flag #3), what finally put the nail in the coffin was hearing my family say \"hey, we haven't seen you around for a few days, is everything OK?\" - this is a surefire sign you have been struggling too much with your tablet.\n\nThe T100 has the right ingredients but the wrong execution. The battery life, speed, and SDD are stellar in this thing, and I hope future generations can learn from the T100. From the wobbly base (by design) finicky dock (by design), and subpar Touchpad, there are both hardware and software issues that need work.\n\nUntil next time Asus, until next time...."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I had to do 5 stars. There is honestly nothing wrong with it, the price is amazing, the quality is better than the price I paid for, no issues, battery does easily the 8+ hours (as advertised), it comes with full Windows 8.1 with Office 2013 Student and a keyboard dock w/ 3.0 usb ability. The dock + program/os alone cost well over $400! This tablet is a steal! Though it is more than a tablet. The screen has beautiful colors, the response is super fast, and the Baytrail cpu has the ability to play games, such as Half life 2 at high settings around 30fps. Wow. Just everything about this Tablet is remaking what we know a Netbook is and making it something everyone should own... but  people with large hands will hate the dock. It is great, buy it. Recommend you getting the 64gb model with a 64gb microsd.\nI BOUGHT 3! Kept the first one, gave the other two away to family for Christmas!\n\nALSO! The Windows logo was finally taken off the tablet. Mine came in with NO BROKEN KEYBOARD! And no Windows logo. So happy I got the second revision from Amazon."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "UPDATE: I sent back the first device due to the keyboard issue. The one that amazon replaced it with is working great. They also got rid of the phantom start button on the front of the tablet, which I think is an improvement. Don't forget to let it go through the initial 8 hour charge... it's definitely worth the wait for the improved all around performance.  Customer service won me over on this item.\n\nThe good:\nTablet-pc running full windows 8.1 for only $379\n\nThe bad:\nThe keyboard that comes with the package feels...cheap. I didn't think much of it at first, the layout works, the touchpad works, the usb works. Shortly after using it I noticed that the touchpad was raised. Sure it pops right back down making that tape/glue like sound that I'm assuming it's held on with, but lo-and-behold after about 5 minutes the left corner has popped right back out!  I contacted amazon after debating if this issue, mainly cosmetic, was worth the hassle of a return. The only way to get the keyboard replaced is to send back the whole unit. So that is what I'm doing. I'll hopefully update with good news once the transaction is complete. (From my research this doesn't seem like a normal issue, the keyboard was probably assembled on a Friday)\n\nMy advice is to make sure the touchpad is set in the keyboard before you start making it your own! File backup and transfer really isn't that fun, I don't care what Nick Burns says.\n\nFinal decision: 4 stars for portability, battery life, and full windows."}

Spent almost 4 hours trying to get the Touchpad to work, including 2 hours spent with two different ASUS tech support reps (who also could not get the Touchpad to work).  Sending it back to Amazon (thank goodness Amazon makes it so easy to return and replace defective merchandise!).  Will try one more time....\n\n11/28/2013 Update:  A replacement ASUS T100TA promptly arrived 2 days after I returned the defective unit (thank you, Amazon).  After spending a couple of hours setting this tablet computer up for my son (most of it spent in the tedious, intrusive and time-consuming creation of Microsoft accounts, as demanded by the unit's configuration programming...), the little tablet, keyboard and touchpad all appear to be functioning normally.  The keyboard keys have minimal travel, but they do provide reasonable tactile feedback.  The touchpad (which did not work on the first unit that I received) is somewhat slow and inaccurate, but it's functional enough for my 9 year-old son.\n\nBecause both hardware and software appear to be working properly on this replacement unit, I have upgraded my original \"1 star\" review to \"3 stars,\" at this time.  If the tablet remains functional, stable and reliable, then I will circle back and further update and upgrade my review."}

I turned it off last night with the battery at half charge; this morning it wouldn't turn on.  Customer service recommended holding down the power button for 30 seconds.  Sometimes this works and sometimes it doesn't.  Today it didn't and I decided to exchange it for a new one. We'll see what the new one does.  For how cheap this thing is, a faulty power button isn't a make or break thing, just annoying.  But if it refuses to turn on at all, then I don't want it.\nThe battery life is good.  The speed is good.  There are annoying Windows 8 things--I keep accidentally making it full screen and sometimes shutting it down.  Chrome crashes sometimes but saves your tabs.  Nothing is annoying enough to make me want to spend $150 more on something else.  It is very light and portable.  The keyboard seems to fail to work sometimes but I don't find it too too cramped... the shift button is in an awkward spot and it's frustrating that there is no up or down arrow keys.\nI will update this review when I learn whether the new one is better or worse.\nUpdate 4/9/14.\nThe new product does not have the power button issues of the last one. I also run google chrome from the windows desktop as the app tends to crash. More weird annoyances: the cushions to prevent the screen from slamming into the keyboard have fallen off--I've only had this thing since November, so that just seems like shoddy workmanship; however, it's the keyboard, not the device itself, so no big deal. The Skydrive/Onedrive makes it so storage is not a problem, either. Overall, I'm happy. And my back is happy that I carry this on it instead of my 5.5 lb laptop."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I got this primarily to test the performance of the Bay Trail processor and thus far I have been pleasantly surprised.  Gone are the old days of frustratingly slow Atom processors.  This device is the perfect evolution of the netbook.\n\nBuild - Not bad at all for the price.  I believe it is the lightest Win8 10inch tablet and is about the same as my GF's Ipad2.  I like the slight visual texture on the back but hate the glossy.  I have seen so many Asus tablets that are lovely and not glossy, so I am disappointed that it was glossy.  Not really a big deal since I ended up putting a skin on mine.  The plastic around the bevel of the screen is a little soft and got a tiny ding when I bumped the edge against the box that the T100 came in.  Then again, the box was sharp enough to draw blood so maybe the plastic will be fine.  A tiny bit of flex, but there is only so much you can do with plastic of this caliber.  For the price, it is fantastic.\n\nScreen - Good screen with great viewing angles.  Plenty of brightness for me.  Colors seem a touch off (a little too yellow), so I am still trying to figure out if that is normal or not and see if I can adjust it.  Resolution might seem low, but it is great for a 10 inch screen, particularly if you spend a lot of time in desktop mode like I do.  I can't imagine how tiny 1080p would render text.  Using Win8 apps, you can notice the slightly lower resolution if holding close, but it is no different than something like the Ipad2.  Touch has been nice and responsive.\n\nKeyboard - The keyboard is definitely cramped and I am still getting used to it, but is fine for emails and short documents.  It is a little disappointing that they made the keys so short when I have seen Asus put much larger keys on similarly sized docks.  Not sure why they changed them.  Would definitely have been nice for a battery and an extra usb port in the dock, but for a free throw in, it is fantastic.  The trackpad isn't super responsive, but it is far more usable than some have said.  For anything that I really need some precision for, I will be using a mouse anyways (or just touch the screen).\n\nPerformance - Pleasantly surprised by the performance.  The Metro UI screen scrolls smoothly and Win8 apps open quickly and run well so far.  For the desktop and more traditional programs, I haven't run into any issues.  Programs are definitely slow to install, and some, like Inkscape take a little longer to open than on my i5 desktop, but so far work without a problem.  I don't plan to do a lot of rendering or editing on this device, so performance is more than good enough.  I'd wager it would be good enough for 90% of regular users.  1080P video played without a hitch as has any video site that I have tried.  I was thinking originally that I would go with an i3 or i5 based tablet, but this has done well enough that I don't think that will be necessary now.  An important thing to note is that the battery life on this thing is stellar!  Easily over the 10 hour mark with mixed straight use at mid brightness.  Standby is great too.  When I use this as a consumption device in tablet mode, I go a couple days of use between charges.  So nice to have full windows functionality in a device so nice to hold and use.\n\nThe only real thing I wish this had was a pressure sensitive pen, but I understand that that would have increased weight, thickness and price.  For the money, I can't be mad.  I got a capacitive pen and it works pretty well, just lacking that bit of precision that comes with an active digitizer.  OK for now, for as much as I would like to take handwritten notes or make amazing art on this device, I just don't do either enough to really stress about it.\n\nAll in all, super pleased with this device and am amazed at the value.  To do better, you would be looking at something like the Dell Venue Pro 11, which has slightly better specs, the pen I'd love, but starts at $500 without keyboard.  I am surprised not more people are talking about this device in the mainstream.  Netbooks were so crappy, yet millions of people used them as their primary or secondary devices.  This bad boy is the perfect evolution.  Better screen, touch, much, much, much better performance, way better battery life and weight, multiple form factors, and at about the same price of the nicer netbooks.  Stunning value.  Highly recommended."}

(2 gigs more ram and double the 64 to128 and I'd be happy to pay $100 more which is still extra profit).\nCharge time is slow. It is absolutely awful with a non-stock charger though (even the same brick and a longer cord which shouldn't make a difference). I would be happy if I could just purchase a longer cable with the same charge speed.\n\nOverall, great value for the price. Would definately buy again.\n\nThis thing even runs World of Warcraft (albeit with minimum settings) comfortably at 30 fps off of a UHS-1 microSD card. Even Orgrimmar and instances were smooth (although Orgrimmar had to load for a bit first until the decent FPS returned). Granted I optimized the graphic processing for speed. \"Fair\" settings garnered a playable 20fps. *I apologize for the shameless WoW nod but I figured it is a solid way to benchmark the machine and is almost ubiquitous."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I received the ASUS Tablet Pad last Friday (11/15/13) and spent the better part of 3 days trying to set it up and learning how to use it. Let me open my remarks with saying that with my long experience with the many releases of Windows (from 3.1 to 7) nothing comes even close to how bad this is. It is almost unusable. I pity the people who get it and are less experienced than I am. I think the ASUS hardware is excellent (although heavier than I expected), in my opinion all the problems are caused by the OS. The lack of the START button is unforgiveable. There is a 3rd party addition which can be downloaded (called Classic Shell) which helps. Also there is another downloadable help called \"God Mode\" this allows tuning the system's myriad parameters. The poorly implemented separate \"metro\" interface (for the apps that mimic Android or Apple online apps) and the \"aero\" interface (like the current Win 7 interface) make it very confusing.\n\nAll this I could have lived with, however in 2 days it crashed 3 times and in each case I was forced to recover to the original setup, thereby losing everything I had done. Mind you the crashes were not caused by doing anything very fancy, they just happened. The last one occurred after I set everything up to my liking and was about to take a full backup. I started the backup program and it advised me that there is an update to it and suggested I download it before running it. When it crashed during the download this was the final straw. I packed up the beast and returned it to Amazon. I must say they were very nice about it and I promptly received a full refund. One more thing: two programs that loaded and ran perfectly in Win 7 could not be loaded here and yes, they were important programs for me.\n\nI must say there were features I liked, like the preloaded Netflix and the ease of connecting to printers on the network and to other computers (XP and Win 7 both) and the \"free\" Office 2013 included. I liked the hardware too."}

I miss the Windows button on the front bezel and never use that one under the volume buttons.  And the keyboard leaves much to be desired.  I have had MANY Android tablets, but for the money nothing comes close to this in power and features.\n\nOne thing I have to say though is that my keyboard wobbles on the desktop when I type.  It is clearly not flat when it is full open.  So i spent the $12 to ship it back to Asus for repair or replacement.  However their response was that while it did wobble, they checked this on 5 other keyboards and they all did it.  So it is \"working as designed\".  While it is safe to say it is working as built, I seriously doubt it was designed to not sit flat.  I just got it back in the mail and it certainly is no different than when I sent it.  So I guess I'm going to take a file to the back right \"foot\" to get it level."}

The screen resolution is fine even though it is not full HD. I had no problems setting it up as I have been a user of Windows 8. If you are new to Windows 8 then you will have to go online and lookup instructions on how to use the operating software as there is no instruction manual included other than a two page startup guide. Be sure to fully charge the unit prior to use as stated in the startup guide and on the blogs and you should have no problems getting started. Right away there were some updates that had started including some Windows 8.1 updates but all went well. What was really nice is Windows 8 automatically syncs your apps and settings if you already have a PC running Windows 8 so that made it very painless. Response time is pretty quick and running apps is fast. Clip on the keyboard and you have a Notebook PC. This is a real buy as I got it on Amazon for $349."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I bought the 32gb version from bestbuy.  At first the T100 was awesome for a couple hours.  Then it began to shutdown every time that I didn't use it for a few minutes and I would have to turn it back on and wait for it to start back up again.  The speakers are loud however I was playing around with the alarm and would leave it ring after about 30 seconds the speakers would give out and a muffled crackle sound would be projected. Then there is the reading mode that changes the screen to a yellow tint whenever you go into email or the reader however mine is now stuck in that form. Not sure if I accidently switched it to always be on that.  Then a couple times half of the screen would turn gray and stay that way.  But I believe that was happening because of an app and not the T100.  I would occasionally get a solid blue screen that would not go away unless I restarted the T100. Also the automatic brightness adjuster can get a little out of control with how often it changes the brightness.  On that note the camera is not the best, but for the price of this machine you cant expect everything.  However when this device is working it works extremely well.  I believe I may have just received a dud.  All the other reviews on this device seem stellar.  Im going to return and it hold for a little while until other bay trail tablets are out."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "In a word, wow!\nI have been hunting for a laptop/tablet combo for some time and was interested in the MS Surface but hated the keyboard and thought the price difference between the base model running the powered down windows and the full windows version was a ridiculous leap (and did I mention that I hated the keyboard?).\nLeading up to this purchase, I have gone through laptops in the past, most recently an Acer netbook (which finally crapped out on me thus leading to this purchase), and an iPad mini with Bluetooth keyboard. The netbook was slow and the iPad was less functional than I wanted for a work station so the death of the netbook led me to renew my search, and finally I landed on this.\nThis is everything I wanted in an affordable package and from a long standing leader in PC hardware (an industry leader on motherboards for a long time). The end result - pure magic.\nI also have to give some major props to MS for the new Win 8, it might be kind of ugly looking at first glance with its simply blocky looks, but it is super fast booting and with a little getting used to is (I am finding) vastly superior to iOS in terms of balance between features and simplicity. The ASUS Transformer includes the full Win 8.1, not the scaled down simplified version which only includes the blocky app screen but no desktop. This translates into instant transfer back and forth between two screens, a full desktop screen and a tablet app screen, which translates into BRILLIANT! I have mostly at this point been using the desktop but the app screen is great for alerting you to your schedule (which once you log in to outlook it automatically syncs with your contacts and schedule) and the arrival of emails. Put this together with a tight and super functional hardware thanks to ASUS and the result is pure gold that doesn't break the bank.\nHere's a sum of the features that make this book the best bang for your buck:\n1. I'm no tech geek but I respect the hardware specs in this and easily eclipses iPads (8 gig HD still being standard, or pay the 'apple tax' to double that for 100$ - this has 64 gigs, about half you get to use thanks to Windows, but also have USB connections, one 3.0 on keyboard and one mini on the tablet, and a micro-SD slot, so memory is not critical like iPads), the screen is clear with brilliant coloration\n2. Functionality of an integrated keyboard/touchpad cannot be overrated - this is lightyears beyond what I was able to achieve with my iPad setup and disconnecting from the keyboard is easy just the touch of a button (it also secures into the base very well and there is no wiggle - a very well designed package)\n3. Software - full Win 8.1 plus free MS Office (compare to the Surface and the price difference is shocking) and this thing handles the full Windows without breaking a sweat (you also get access to a 1000gb ASUS virtual memory internet drive if you think the 64gb HD is too small)\n4. Design is simple but very functional, after a little getting used to all the buttons and whatnot are easily accessible and they also got rid of a lot of the extraneous buttons that have come to plague most PC-books\n\nUltimately the looks of the Transformer don't make it stand out in a crowd, but put all the features together and this thing is the best deal on the market - I couldn't be more pleased with it!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I bought the T100 about a week and a half ago and I'm in love with it. It has shortcomings, but it makes up for those with aplomb.  I'm going to go over a few points that I think will be helpful (and I already wrote for ars).\n\nBugginess\nTo start out with I think Asus released buggy software at the start. Online you'll see a few different revisions being sold and I purposefully bought what I believed to be a later model and have had zero issues with keyboards, black screens when charging etc... My trackpad also seems to work well though some gestures don't get picked up great. I ended up disabling all their trackpad software. I definitely don't fault the reviewers for this, but I wanted to let people know that this is not the norm.\n\nSoftware & Windows\nThe reviews rightly pointed out the the lack of apps for RT, but the big stuff I use is on the Windows store. More importantly you have access to all your normal apps. This was a big thing for me. I had the original Surface and I loved 8.1 but sometimes I needed an app, like something for FTP or a good code editor, or a good image editor and it wasn't there. With a full version of windows I get the RT apps which work great then I can run a full version of Photoshop, Sublime Text & WinSCP when I need.  In addition you can install Steam and actually play games.\n\nReally the ability to run regular Windows apps is what sold me on this. Beyond the free copy of Office you get, you can run basically anything on this. Unlike iOS or Android I'm not limited in my options or limited to a touch screen. If I need to do work, I can do it and then with a swipe bring back ars while hulu is snapped to the side of my screen. Windows 8 just really shines on this machine. You'll get Microsoft's vision if you use this for a few minutes.\n\nHardware\nThe Atom CPU and Windows 8 keep everything incredibly smooth. As the reviews have mentioned you can bog it down if you do a bunch on your desktop but I was playing games while it streamed a movie from its sd card to my xbox 360. It really packs a punch hardware wise. You won't play the latest titles, even at the lowest res, but if you're like me and travel a bit for work anything can be great. I'm actually looking forward to my next flight as I know I can now play Civ 5 on lower settings.\n\nThe display isn't great, but it also isn't bad. The colors look nice, and viewing angles are fine. Higher res might be nice but on a 10\" I'm not bothered.\n\nThe sound is surprisingly good. No, I'm actually blown away by how good the speakers on this machine are. It's just weird. They're loud, clear and actually seem to have a fairly good range. I mean they're not going to compete with your desktop speakers at all but for a tablet they're amazing.\n\nThe battery life is fantastic. Seriously all day battery with my usage. I was sick the other day and played FTL for about 2 hours, watched some hulu, a movie, then realized I could use Play To with my 360 and watched another movie by streaming it to my tv through my xbox 360 while browsing the web and ended up with about 50% battery after maybe 5 or 6 hours. I did find that it clocks itself down to about 600mhz when you get under 10% and you'll start to see some performance issues then. Really the only issue here is it charges with micro usb so charge times can take a bit.\n\nMaterials & Design\nOk, so now the bad. The keyboard is fine in my opinion. I really love typing on it actually, but it is a little cramped. My biggest peeve though is the right shift key is super small. The trackpad is fine. I'd like it if it were bigger, if it worked better and if they basically transplanted a macbook pro's trackpad, but as far as windows computers go this is fine.\n\nThe biggest issue is definitely the materials they used. The only word to describe the back of the tablet is cheap. The materials in general aren't great which was the hardest part of moving from a Surface.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nI wish the screen had a glass panel, I wish it was made of aluminum, I wish the keyboard was laid out differently, I wish the trackpad was better, I wish the windows key was hidden away somewhere other then next to the volume button. It would be neat if there were options for keyboard bases with additional storage. I'd love a kickstand on the tablet portion. There are a lot of faults, but the important thing about this is it's amazing.\n\nBasically I'd love if Microsoft had made this. If they'd just put an Atom inside the Surface 2 it would have blown everyone's minds. This isn't bad though. Sure if you take it to a coffee shop, people will probably drop money into your laptop bags as they walk past with their iPads and MacBook's. Android users will probably scoff at you for using Windows. But in the end you'll have a great computer that can really do anything except possibly look amazing.\n\nIn closing, I love my T100."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I bought this for my birthday from Walmart a week ago (immediate gratification). Actually, this is the second one, as I returned the first for the current because it appeared to be faulty (premature determination). The reason I returned the first one is because I couldn't get it to turn on after the first time. The second unit had the same issue, but I figured out I could hold the power button down for about 10 seconds (hard restart) and it would turn on.\n\nThis was unacceptable. I updated the BIOS from the Asus site and the issue was fixed. I've been going 6 days now with no problems.\n\nI bought this to replace an older Archos 101 that gave up the ghost. While researching a replacement, I had pretty much decided on a Google Nexus 10 2013, but there only rumors about whether it even existed. Then, I came across a review about the Asus T100ta.\n\n I had looked at the Surface Pro, but it cost a lot more than I was willing to spend. This is actually what I was looking for and I didn't even know it. Full Win 8.1 (as opposed to Android), keyboard, 64GB storage, microSD slot, USB 3.0...wow. And just $379. Oh, did I forget to mention Office 2013 Home and Student?\n\nYes, it takes a while to initially charge it (mine took about 5 hours). Yes, I had to manually update the BIOS before it worked properly. Yes, the keyboard is a bit cramped. A few shortcomings, but I love it. Battery life (after it's fully charged) is like forever (well, around 10 hours). You can run any Windows program. I can even VPN into my work computer. You can really type. Screen resolution is very good (not excellent). I'm not a fan of Win8. In fact, this is my first exposure to it. However, on a touchscreen, I'm comfortable with it, after reading the tips.\n\nI am very happy I made this purchase as opposed to another Android slate. If you're of the fence about buying one, go ahead and pull the trigger.\n\nUpdate 11/28/13: No more fingerprints! I bought the Skinomi TechSkin - Asus Transformer Book T100 here on Amazon. It is lazer cut to fit the T100. It is a skin that mimics carbon fiber and sticks to the back of the tablet portion. It has cutouts for all the buttons, ports, speakers, and even the Asus logo. The fit is very good, but I did need to trim around a few of the ports with a utility knife (I'd recommend an X-acto knife though). This very minor surgery may not have been necessary had I been a little more careful with the application of it. I started from the middle to ensure the Asus logo was properly aligned. If you do it this way, you may want another person to help you by holding up the side you're not working on and working one side at a time.\n\nThis skin makes the transformer look a lot more upscale. It doesn't collect fingerprints and improves the grip a bit."}

I did wait for the model because of the new quad core CPU. it was worth the wait. Amazon delivered it to me in 24 hrs. So, how is this tablet? It is good. Let me detail:\n\nPro:\n- It's light, even with the keyboard.\n- The battery is slow to charge, but only on first time use\n- The screen is good, crisp and clear\n- The touch interface is very smooth and quick. The Quad Core CPU shines here. There is no lag\n- The keyboard is quite good for the size\n- The dock system is excellent and works as good as it should\n- The battery does last as it says\n- 8.1 full version is great.\n- MS office Home and business is great and free\n- The Price\n\nCons:\n\n- The bezel and screen is a finger print magnet\n- The touch-pad buttons on the keyboard seem fragile\n- I hate micro USB charging, because the connectors are never stable, (but standards make charging and chargers easier to get)\n\nAfter 10 days of playing with it:\n\n- Still good as it gets\n- Windows 8 Store problem encountered. Took a few days to fix it (not related to hardware)\n- New problem is seen during docking live. Gives a windows error (blue screen) gathers data for MS and boots back.\n- Apps are great. New Skype app corrects the earlier problems. Works very well.\n\nThat said, this also must be said. These small devices really requires Apps. The full version desktop screen is really very small. Apps gives you the ability to have perfect design for tablets and takes the windows restriction away. In a short while, the desktop will be redundant. Maybe that's always what MS wanted, move everyone to an RT-Like environment."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "This tablet is terrific!  It's quick, the battery lasts a long time, and it's a proper laptop replacement.  Sure, if you're already invested into iOS or Android, go ahead and stick with those.  But, if you're a long-time PC user like me (and an IT professional for the last 15+ years), this is the way to go.  I have a Sandy Bridge i7-2600K desktop and an Ivy Bridge i5-3317U Ultrabook - so I know what power is - but this tablet does not disappoint.  It handles Netflix and 1080p videos just fine.  Sure, it won't run Photoshop or AutoCAD (well, it might but I didn't try), but it'll run StarCraft 2 on low settings at 30-40fps.  Some might complain about the modest screen resolution compared to the Nexus 10 or the iPad retina display, but have you ever tried running Windows at 1080p on a 10-11\" screen?  I have (on the Surface Pro), and Windows doesn't scale too well so text is either tiny or awkward.  Plus, iOS and Android (excluding Samsung's multi-view) do not let you run apps side by side.  With Windows 8 you can snap two Metro apps or run as many side by side as you want on the classic desktop.\n\nThe tablet by itself is light and solid, the keyboard is fairly comfortable (and doesn't need to be charged), the multi-touch gestures on the trackpad work reasonably well, and the USB port is super convenient.  Unless you're looking for a tablet with an Intel Core processor, a digitizer, or TPM support, I highly recommend this tablet."}

This is the one to throw in your sling bag to carry with you! Having the included Office is a real bonus as well. Biggest advantages to me are: Keyboard, USB 3.0 port (on keyboard), light weight and thin profile.\nMy only complaint is one which I did not see in any reviews I red before purchasing this, the micro SD slot leaves the card protruding enough to make me nervous about it popping out. This slot should be recessed deeper to prevent that from happening."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "A great value.  I have been waiting for a Windows tablet that isn't huge in foot print (think 13 inches, no one wants to carry that) but still gives a full experience and it has been delivered.  It is important to remember what this will provide.  If you are expecting a $1500 windows computer experience you will be disappointed.\n\nThe good:\nthis is solidly built, the dock and hinge feel sturdy to my hands.  The keys have a nice report and feel nice under finger. The screen is good not the best, but for 350 what did you expect?  The touch screen is very responsive and works great for up to 5 points of contact as advertised.  The machine has a good amount of pep.  These Atom processors are getting pretty serviceable, heck I can play Left for dead 2 on it without any issue at all. The Intel video graphics have come a long way since I last bought a PC with Intel graphics inside. Battery life really is 11 hours or more.\n\nThe Bad:\nMy first unit got swapped by my local retailer because of a defect (it stopped booting to windows 2 days after purchase and the bios stopped seeing the hard drive as a viable boot option), but the second has been running strong for a few days now.  The second unit had some performance issues and an inspection to the throttling of the CPU for power management reveled it simply wouldn't go faster than .750 GHZ.  Having had a unit that performed much better, I elected to factory restore like another reviewer suggested.  This has worked and the CPU will now hit 1.88 ghz (depending on usage) as it should.  My suggestion give it test drive for a few hours before you fully configure it to your liking, if it isn't surprisingly snappy for an Atom then you should format it. (For the techno phobes its not too hard to do. Swipe from the right, hit the search icon (magnifying glass), type remove, and 3 or 4 down you should see \"remove everything and re-install windows\". From there follow the prompts.)\n\nDislike:\nThe touch pad.  Asus really could have done a lot better here.  It's functional sure, but its mushy feel and lack of distinct left right buttons leave me with a bad taste in my mouth.  Sensitivity there is fine, but I prefer my Logitech travel mouse by a long shot. unlike on my Lenovo work laptop where the travel mouses propensity for hand cramps has me preferring Lenovo's touch pad. With its 11 hour battery life I didn't expect to use it plugged in so much, but I find I'm always looking for power plugs because it takes 6-8 hours to charge it to full.  Maybe I'll break this habit and get over the mental block that 30% power still means I have hours to go, but given the short life of all my other electronics at 30% this will be hard to do.\n\nWould I buy it again? Absolutely!\nI even recommend you do too, just accept that you will want a cheap travel mouse for when you are creating content and that you will use the touchscreen for everything else."}

The screen, while it's only 1366x768 looks sharper than more than a few Android tablet screens I've seen at 1280x800. The ability to go to full 1080p over HDMI is great (for both productivity and watching HD content over Netflix,) and the ability to use it both as a tablet and a Windows desktop has made it a useful benchtop Arduino development machine. Also, battery life is superb.\n\nThere are quirks. You have to disable some of the gestures that the touchpad supports, because they tend to get in the way (especially given how small the touchpad is.) Using it as conventional laptop touchpad requires firm taps of the integrated switches to get them to register. Also, the micro USB charger takes an absolute age to charge the battery, and the power button requires quite a firm press to get it to register.\n\nAlso, there are a number of Windows updates that will break the machine. Don't accept the default of \"install updates when they come out.\" Set it up so that it notifies you of updates to be installed, and you have to manually approve/disapprove of them. Don't install the updated WiFi driver, and don't install the big rollup updates.

The keyboard is made heavier deliberately to balance the tablet.  Detach the keyboard, an it's half the weight.\n- Relatively powerful.  I have a browser open and work in MS Office comfortably with no lag.  Even basic photo editors are snappy.\n- Multitasking is excellent.  I really believe Windows 8 was made for such a device.  Run metro in tablet mode, run desktop when working with the keyboard.  Split screen is a marvelous feature and all works perfectly with a quad-core processor.\n- Dual band WiFi.  I live in an apartment building and can simultaneously see about 20 separate SSIDs.  Dual band to the rescue.\n- IPS panel - viewing angles on the monitor are excellent.  I'm wondering why a $1,000 laptop would have a TN panel and a $300 tablet would have an IPS?  You'll enjoy it.  Also, the first unit I tried from BestBuy was a B1 model - I returned it due to networking issues.  This one is C1 and it seems to me that the unit is better color calibrated than a B1.  Just my opinion.\n\nCons:\n- Keyboard is just meh.  I don't mind it, but my hands are small. Someone with bigger hands would feel constricted.\n- Trackpad is ok, but the trackpad buttons are just bad.  You need to click close to the button separator to get a reliable click.\n- Only 1366x768 resolution.  Not a deal-breaker, but my son's Lenovo Miix 2 (yep, he snagged one of pre-release ones from Amazon) has a full HD screen with not much of a noticeable hit to the performance. EDIT: Miix 2 doesn't have full HD. Still low res compared to other tablets on the market, most notably Nexus 7 2013.  I'll take full Windows at lower resolution over Android with higher resolution.\n\nOther thoughts:\n- I had a weird issue that my router (ASUS N66U) would not work normally with this tablet ONLY.  I needed to restore router to its factory settings to get the full speed.  After re-inputting all of my custom settings in the router it still works fine.  Just a quirk.\n- To those who ask \"But can it run Crysis?\" the answer is YES! My son and I did it for giggles.  60 FPS at medium settings.  Can also run Mass Effect 2, Fallout 3 and Civ 5 at respectable quality settings."}

By the second day of trying to get this machine to work, I sounded like an abused spouse justifying its poor behavior - \"I can fix it if I try harder\", \"once it's installed everything it won't break down again\", \"I shouldn't have pushed it so hard by installing that program\", \"hardly any computers nowadays work well right out of the box\", \"when it does work it's a lot of fun\", etc. I've finally come to my senses and stopped with the excuses.\n\nNow, some of the things it failed to do correctly:\n1) start up (at least 3 times, it tried to install \"updates\" - for what, I don't know - shouldn't it have gotten everything on the first round of updates? Again, it had been 4 days of use! - and it knocked itself out. At those points, it took up to 20 attempts of restarting to get it going, and all the while it was offering to fix the problem through deleting all added files & programs. I can't imagine having to upload my documents over and over on a daily or weekly basis.)\n2) shut down (sometimes it ignored all attempts to turn it off, including the brute-force hitting of the power button.)\n3) read externally-linked devices (it completely failed to recognize my Kindle when I hooked them together by USB. I went out and bought a new cord from the Microsoft store - \"maybe it just needs a USB 3 adaptor instead of my old USB 2\" - and that got me to the point where it would recognize the Kindle for ~2 minutes, then conk out.)\n4) recognize touch-screen commands (sometimes it liked the hand, and sometimes it liked the stylus, but sometimes it didn't like anything.)\n5) recognize keyboard commands (again, sometimes the mouse and pointer keys were acceptable, and other times they were not.)\n\nThis is the first truly negative review I have written for Amazon, as far as I recall, and it has nothing to do with Amazon's end of the deal. This particular computer is simply not functional. I desperately needed a new laptop, as I am going on a business trip in less than 2 weeks, and my current computer is old and cannot handle wireless anymore. Now, because of the time crunch, I have ordered a Dell to be express-shipped from Best Buy, so that I can have it for a day or two before the trip and get everything onto it.\n\nI made the mistake of pooh-poohing the negative reviews, because the price was so attractive and because I gave too much weight to the positive reviews. Now I have to look at it this way: if I can't turn on the computer, what good is the free Office suite that it came with, which I can't access? How it is saving money to get something that doesn't do the job?"}

It was fast, responsive, light weight, the battery was amazing, etc.  I did have an issue where the computer wouldn't respond when being 'awoken' from sleep mode when plugged in, and at the advice of Asus, I updated the BIOS.  After the BIOS update (which gave no error) the computer shut down, and wouldn't turn back on at all.  I attempted every key press, every combination of buttons on the device and on the keyboard, but it was bricked.  The back light for the screen wouldn't even come on, and the only semblance of it working was the white LED that came on when I plugged it into power.  The retailer that I purchased it from is now sold out, so I sent it back for a refund."}

I know a lot of people say how terrible the Windows apps are, but I knew I wanted a Windows-based system, since I already had access to the Apple store apps through my phone. I use mine more for school/work anyway, and there are plenty of useful apps/fun games.\n\nI love that this computer can easily be turned into a tablet, yet it has the full Windows operating system. It has a USB 3.0 port in the (amazingly well-crafted) keyboard for hooking up a wireless mouse, external hard drive, etc. Typing can be a bit slow at first, but it's easy to get used to the smaller keyboard. The reason I went with this vs other Windows tablets/pcs is because of the price and the components. No other similar tablet/pc compares for the price."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "This laptop/tablet combo is good, but it could be a lot better with just a few tweaks.\n\nThe Software:\nThere were a few instances where the drivers that Asus was downloading were interfering with the Microsoft drivers and caused the system to crash pretty bad. I was able to get it back up and running after doing a full restore.\nThe system at first would not take my Microsoft account.\nMusic will not play in the background on desktop apps, but will on Modern/Metro apps, but that's not Asus's fault, it's how Microsoft designed the operating system for the tablet.\nOther than that, I really love the metro interface and how well the laptop holds up.\nThere is almost no lag on any of the programs that I have launched. I am impressed with how well this laptop can handle what I throw at it.\nHaving Office with this laptop is a very nice feature, and it has a big price tag on its own.\n\nThe hardware:\nThe speakers are the best I've seen on a tablet to date. I was impressed as it did better than all the laptops I've ever owned. This is something that Asus really has down very well.\nThe screen is nice and is very responsive to the touch.\nThe power had issues at the beginning, but after a system restore I was able to get the correct drivers for it.\nThe charging is slow, but it's about the same speed as I've seen for Android tablets. I didn't expect it to go that fast with a Micro USB port.\nThe keyboard dock is good, and the tablet will fit in every time. It gives a Windows sound when it's connected. Has a USB 3.0 port.\nThe keyboard isn't lit up and I wish there was an option for a backlit keyboard, as I would buy one.\nThe keyboard is also a little cramped, but it was what I expected with the size of the screen.\nAlso wish the keyboard had a battery like previous Asus Transformers.\nBattery life is about nine hours for me, but I'm a heavy user. I recommend charging it while you sleep.\n\nI just needed something small that can run Windows. This fit the bill for me as it has Office included. I would buy again."}

This can become everyone's  first small device that is your PRIMARY device (your phone, desktop replacement, etc., will sync to this as your SECONDARY devices....seriously). The T100TA is the beginning of the end of the portable device being the \"compromise\", and the beginning of the end of bigger/better/faster/more, unless you really, really want to pay a lot more for a small screen upgrade and a barely noticeable processor or hard drive upgrade (cloud, anyone?). Honestly, there isn't much wiggle room up from this in terms of noticeable impact on user productivity. Completely blows away all competition within $300 of its price. C'mon. Pre-installed Office, Win 8.1, BAY TRAIL processor? You're basically buying yourself a Windows Surface for half the price, and sacrificing very little- okay, the 768 screen is a downgrade from a 1080i screen, but do you really watch your Friday night movies on your 10 inch portable device?I've been told it benchmarks the same as a 2011 MacBook Air, and I don't doubt it does. the beginning of the masses' conversion to the next stage in personal computing.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I've now had this laptop for about 6 weeks.  After some initial issues (detailed below), it has stabilized and become a favorite.  I've now owned an ipad, a Galaxy Note (Android), and this Tablet (Windows 8).  I have to say this is my favorite device so far.  There is a learning curve, though.\n\nNow that I've owned it a while, here are some of the pros and cons:\n\nTHE GOOD\n\n-Lightweight\n-Good battery life\n-Decent build quality (for the price)\n-Great screen for surfing, watching videos, etc.\n-Easy to type on (once you get used to it)\n-Processor is surprisingly fast and 2GB memory is plenty, believe it or not\n-MS Office included and works great\n-Run Win 8 apps like a tablet or run \"real\" Windows programs like a laptop\n\nTHE BAD\n\n-The trackpad is pretty bad -- I use a mouse when I'm at a desk\n-The screen is a little wobbly where it hinges to the keyboard\n-It is VERY easy to popout the micro SD card -- you'll lose it if you're not careful\n-Every now and then it powers all the way down when sitting unattended (instead of going to sleep)\n-The Windows 8 app store is really limited.  A lot of the standards are there (Netflix, Dropbox, etc.) but a lot are missing (Pandora and YouTube, although you can run these with some limitations in a browser).\n\nSOME TIPS\n\n-Create a recovery \"disk\" using an 8GB thumb drive. This will free up much-needed space on your primary drive. Just type \"recovery\" from the Start screen and you'll be guided through it.\n-Get a micro SD card for additional storage.  I have 64GB which I use for movies and other large files.\n-UPDATE YOUR BIOS.  Before I did this I had all kinds of errors. I've updated the BIOS twice and it made a huge difference.\n\nFINAL COMMENTS\n\nThis device has a few quirks but I really love it, especially for the price.  It is GREAT on a plane where tray table space is really limited and battery life matters.  I like it enough that I bought a second one for my business partner.\n\nI recommend this device especially if you want/need to run Legacy Windows programs.\n\n------------------\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW\n\nThis is a good tablet for the price.  As others have stated, Asus seems to have some quality control issues though.  On my unit, the headphone jack was dead on arrival, so I couldn't use the tablet with headphones.  I also have bluetooth issues; sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  I often have to re-pair devices to get them to work.\n\nI returned the unit.  I'll try another and will update this review if I have better luck.  It's a severe bummer that I have to reinstall all my software, configure everything, etc.  That took the better part of a day the first time around.\n\nSome other observations:  The screen is good but not great.  As others describe it's not as bright as its competitors.  Perfectly usable though and videos, etc. work great.  I used the HDMI jack to play games on my TV and it worked well.\n\nTrackpad is meh but usable.  Yes, the buttons sound and feel cheap.  I find it works better to just click on the main part of the trackpad.\n\nI like the keyboard quite a bit.  My hands are small and I have no trouble typing fast on this keyboard.  Some of the keys are in different locations (arrows, etc.) so that takes some retraining.\n\nWindows 8 has a learning curve but it's not as bad as many people say.  Now that I've gotten used to it I like it better than my iPad.  It's a lot more powerful and you can more easily navigate between apps.  For me the ability to run legacy Windows software was a requirement so I find the Win 8 split personality perfectly acceptable.\n\nI would have given this 4 stars if it weren't for the broken headset jack and the bluetooth issue.  If my next unit is better I will upgrade my review.\n\n------------------\n\nUPDATE 11/20/2013:  Amazon replaced my originally-broken tablet with one that appears to be working fine.  I'm upgrading from 2 stars to 3 stars since everything seems OK so far.  I like this tablet more now that I've had a few days with it.  If the quality holds I'll update this review again.\n\nOne interesting experience: I was dreading having to reconfigure the replacement tablet. However, an amazing amount of configuration happened automatically because Windows 8 remembered a lot from my first tablet.  So, most of the apps I had previously downloaded were already on the desktop the first time I fired it up.  Thanks Microsoft, that's a nice touch.\n\nBy the way, both of my setup experiences worked fine.  No need to do complicated installs like some reviewers experienced.  I basically plugged it in, followed the on-screen instructions, and things pretty much just worked.\n\n------------------\n\nUPDATE 12/03/2013:  My replacement had a different set of issues related to powering up and down.  Interestingly, none of these occurred with the first tablet.  In any case, I believe these are now fixed (see below) but here are the details of the issues:\n\n* Sometimes after putting the tablet into sleep mode it wouldn't wake up.  It would require a hard boot (holding down the power button for 10-20 seconds to shut the thing off, then another 10-20 seconds to power it back on).  Sometimes it would take several tries to bring it back to life.  This was happening several times a day.\n\n* Twice when fully powered off, I picked up the tablet after a few hours to find it had powered itself back up.  When this happened, the battery would be well depleted.  This happened once right before a flight, so I had only 50% left for my cross-country flight.  (Fortunately there was still enough power to get from Orlando to Los Angeles...this thing has great battery life.)\n\n* When plugging or unplugging the tablet, it would often lock up and require a hard boot.  This happened about 50% of the time when plugging/unplugging.\n\nGOOD NEWS:  Yesterday I installed a BIOS update (version 220 dated 12/02/2013).  Since doing this, all 3 of these issues have disappeared.  I won't declare victory yet, but if it goes a few days without the issues, I'll be a happy camper.\n\nBy the way, I REALLY like this tablet.  The more I use it, the more I like it.  The power issues were certainly annoying so I hope they are now fixed.  I'll come back in a few days with a further update.\n\nOne other thing:  my tablet does not have the Windows logo sticker that many others have commented on.  It appears Asus removed this so people wouldn't assume it was a button and get confused."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "While I did have to return the first T100 I received because of a defect in the Broadcom wifi radio, Amazon's return policy through UPS made me \"happy, happy,\" and the replacement unit I received in less than 48 hours is working perfectly (so far).  With the \"bang for the buck\" that this unit offers, including the convertible feature, 10.1 inch HD display, 64 gig solid state drive (with option to add a micro-SD card for added storage), the full blown Win 8.1 *and* Microsoft Office Home/Student edition, I have to say that whatever compromises ASUS made to get to this price point must have been the right ones.  No wonder it's a best seller.\n\n11/29: It has been a couple weeks and the *same* issue came up (failure of the Broadcom wifi radio.  A reboot did not bring it back.  I looked up how to \"refresh\" and proceeded to do a second reboot and pressed the F9 key during the reboot.  The \"failed\" Broadcom came back to life.  I don't know whether pressing F9 during the second reboot attempt did the trick, or whether there is some other factor involved.  But at least for now, I am keeping this T100.  If I experience this failure again, I will try the same solution (pressing F9 during reboot).  Other than this issue, performance of this unit has been flawless, and if a periodic reboot with an F9 press is all I need to do, that'll be fine.  I wonder if anyone else has experienced this issue? (I am keeping the 5 star review - if it hadn't resurrected, this would have gone down to a 1 star.  I am going to ask a \"question\" about this."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "This tablet is exactly what I was looking for and more.  I could not be happier with the product, even with it's few glitches (more on that later).  I haven't needed to restore the factory default settings yet, even after several weeks of use, and that's saying a lot because when I first get a new device I load it down as much as possible to see what I can and can't use it for.\n\nSo far the only thing this tablet cannot do is run Unity3D, a game engine I use.  I can connect to any of my live web/gaming servers and manage them as though I was sitting at my desk.  I can play any game in the Windows 8 App Store, and even run games from my childhood via DosBox.  I can manage SQL servers, send my girlfriend text messages, answer work e-mails, and control my XBox 360, all done seamlessly from this device.\n\nCons:\nSometimes the system just doesn't want to turn on.  I never need it enough for this to bother me much, and usually holding the power button down for 15 seconds or so will bring it back to life.  I am convinced that this is not the fault of the device, but is a WIndows 8 problem, since this only happens when there is an update to install.\n\nThat's my only complaint.\n\nPros: I could go on and on about what this tablet can do.  A full windows operating system on a 10\" (perfect size if you ask me) tablet that comes with Remote Desktop Connection pre-installed?  Games are easier to find, install, and remove than ever before.  All my previous software works (with the exception of Unity3D), and I've even gone so far as to install a standalone server on this tablet and it works just fine.  I can browse Netflix via my XBox with a few swipes of my fingers, and then when I play Halo 4 automatically connect to my stats page via Smart Glass.  A few swipes later and I've ordered formula for my daughter via the Amazon app, and then I'm playing Halo Spartan Assault and earning XBox achievements.  And when the Xbox One comes out, I'll even be able to control my cable television with Smart Glass.\n\nIf you're a gamer, a quick search on Amazon and $15 will get you a usb receiver that allows you to connect a wireless Xbox Controller to this tablet for gaming.  If you have a non-wireless controller, you can simply plug the controller into the usb port on the side of the keyboard, visit the Microsoft downloads site for their Controller drivers, and then you're playing games on a mini-console.\n\nIf you're a power Windows user, Remote Desktop Conn. allows you to connect to any server just as easily as with previous versions... actually, I think the new setup is actually sleeker, it just takes a tiny bit of effort to get things pinned to your start menu the way you want.  Full access to a command prompt, the ability to run standalone servers for testing, and even the power to run Adobe Photoshop (version CS6, I've experienced 0 problems other than fonts can get hard to read on the screen).  But, where this tablet really shines is that for a few bucks you can get a cable that allows you to plug this device into any screen with an HDMI port.  I've used this setup multiple times to convert my tablet into a drawing pad by hooking it up to my 23\" monitor at my desk.  The graphics driver will output fullscreen to a 1080p screen as well, but you will need to use only the larger screen, since the built in screen is only capable of 1366x768... otherwise you have black borders.  Also useful for gamers, this means that paired with the Xbox Controller, you have a mini-console that is also capable of playing on your tv.\n\nMisc:\nThe first thing I did with my tablet was to learn everything I could about Windows 8.  It is unlike any operating system before it, and I'm not arrogant enough to think that I'll be able to figure out everything on my own, even with 20+ years experience with computers.\n\nNext, I turned off some gestures for the touchpad.  I'm not sure what Asus was thinking here, but the touchpad works terrible when set to factory defaults.  You can find the software responsible for this weird behavior in your taskbar (go to desktop [ Windows Key + D] and in the lower right of the screen there will be icons... find the one for your touchpad and open it.. there will be three tabs, each giving you customization over how certain gestures will work).  After this fix, my touchpad operated like a normal Win 7 laptop, and I was much less frustrated.\n\nI'll end this here.  In summary, this tablet is a power house for the price, and although I don't use the keyboard nearly as often as I though I would, it is priceless when you do need it, and that USB port opens up a world of possibilities.  Aside from the few booting problems, which I am convinced are a result of the OS, not the tablet itself, this tablet is batting 1.000 in my book.  Windows 8.1 has it's bugs, but none of them make the OS anywhere near \"useless\", and I've already decided since using this tablet that my desktop machine will be upgraded to Windows 8 and a touch-screen in the near future.\n\nWindows 8 is quite different from 7, and chances are you're going to have to do some google searches to figure some things out, but I'm not sure why so many people are giving this tablet bad reviews simply because they don't understand how to use Windows 8.  This tablet was awesome when I first turned it on, and now that I have everything customized for me, it's just incredible.  For instance, the default setting for a swipe from the left is to go back to the previous program.  As a multi-tasker that didn't work for me... and a google search later my device now brings up a taskbar when I swipe in from the left."}

The Vivotab Smart is a well made package with a slow processor and technical issues (wifi; battery drain, and others) that Asus never resolved. The new T100 seems to have a lot more power, is more stable, but I would have to describe its physical construction as junk. This starts with the tablet, which has a hollow, very plastic feel to it. It has more flex, rough edges, and just a cheap feel - almost like a toy. The keyboard is worse. Mine came warped like others have reported. I had to bend it so that the front edge lay flat. The back is supported on 2 rubber tabs when the tablet is raised. The result is that the entire keyboard flexes when you type and the keys have a hollow feel, again, almost like a toy. Also, the width of the keyboard is the same as the previous one, but the keys are not as tall. i.e. the keys are narrow rectangles rather than square. It therefore feels much more cramped than the previous keyboard. Other disappointments are the screen, which is much less bright than the previous version, lack of rear camera, and lower res front camera. I returned mine, and will continue to live with the older Vivotab Smart's faults."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "So, I have been waiting for this to come out and in a nutshell, this is not the best tablet and not the best notebook, but overall has a lot of versatility that really makes up for any shortcomings.\n\nTo provide perspective, I have used iPad, Android and Windows 8  (first generation Atoms and Surface) so I feel like I can provide good feedback.\n\nOverall, as a tablet, the size works well. Many of the first generations were so wide they were a little awkward. This size feels right on. it is easy to hold and not very heavy. One minor complaint is that the speakers are on the back and I feel like the sound might get a little muffled when I hold it. Minor complaint, though.\n\nWhen docked, it is very usable, though the keyboard is cramped. I can certainly get some work done, but I am not breaking any typing speed records with this thing. The trackpad is ok. I heard some complaints about this and at the suggestion of another person, I disabled most of the smart gestures (Asus application) and it seems to work well enough. It is a little small, but does the job. Warning...the button presses are obnoxious...very loud. I think someone accurately described it as sounding like that bubble think in the Trouble board game. It has bluetooth though so if I need to do anything significant I use a wireless mouse.\n\nOffice is an added bonus. I am in graduate school and I was trying to use Open Office, but I cant stand it. This might work for others, but everyone else I my school group is using Office and I use that at work so the learning curve and minor conversion issues were driving me crazy. The fact that Office was included is awesome.\n\nPerformance with Bay Trail is also good...better than I expected. The other Atom processors were tolerable I guess, but barely so. This processor is noticeable faster and seems more than adequate for email, browsing, watching video and productivity tasks.\n\nScreen...I saw some say brightness wasn't that good, but I find that it is plenty good enough for indoor use.\n\nBattery life is great. Close to my iPad...for what you get, that really is awesome. And it has to be, because charging takes A LONG TIME. and I mean it. To be honest, I am thinking it would take days unless this thing is turned off. I am not sure why that is. In order to make sure that this has a full charge it is like I have to shut it down and give it at least 4 hours. Would have rather seen another option that microUSB for that. I can certainly work around it, but it is a little annoying.\n\nWindows 8.1...I don't share the same Windows 8 hate that everyone has. There was a little bit of a learning curve, but I appreciate what Microsoft is trying to do. I think that Windows 8.1 is a good improvement over Windows 8.\n\nI paid 329.00 for this and I think it is a great deal. As mentioned, I do not think it is really a leader in any single area. With the dock and Office, though, this is a fantastic value.\n\nUPDATE...I was using a USB extension cable because the included USB cable is very short. I removed this from the setup and charged just with the included cables and it seems to charge faster, though still slow."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I have been using tablets for 10 years, first Windows XP Tablet edition, more recently Android. I am also a heavy user ofWindows laptops and desktops, and my primary personal computer is a Windows 8 core i7 laptop, so I am used to a responsive computer. I have to say the Asus T100TA is a joy to use as a tablet, and not bad as a netbook. It is responsive, with an excellent screen, and great build quality (I have no idea how anybody could complain about it at this price point). The keyboard has good feel, with only he touchpad feeling cheap. I find myself touching the screen rather than using the pad even when docked.\n\nTalking about the value again, the T100TA comes with full Windows 8.1, not Windows RT, so it can run traditional Windows programs. It won't run processor intensive programs very fast, but it will run them. I loaded Ligthroom just for fun, and it ran fine.  Transfer speeds of images from my thumb drive were excellent, so the USB port is a good implementation of the 3.0 standard.\n\nThis next coment s not specific to the Asus. I have not been a big fan of the Metro UI on a laptop, but on a tablet it is really slick. There are so many features that become usable when you touch the screen. Using the touchpad on the Asus was the same as on my laptop; too many false edge swipes.\n\nIn summary, a 5 star tablet, and a 4 star netbook. I thoroughly recommend it."}

I love the USB 3.0 on the keyboard and was able to plug my printer and my flash drive into it. The battery life seems good and I was able to work and print all day without plugging it in for a recharge.\n\nCons: The tablet has a very slick texture on the back and gets finger print easily. It needs a different texture on the back so it won't slip out of the hands. As a tablet it is still lacking many apps that are on my Galaxy Note 10.1 for me to completely switch tablets.  The App store seems cheesey and Windows 8.1 still doesn't seem as polished as other tablets. I found myself wanting to go back to my Galaxy Note 10.1 and wishing Galaxy Note had the full version of Microsoft Office with the Access database program running on it."}

If a Galaxy Note phone is in my pocket, can I sit down? How do the keys on a T100 feel?\nI have been intrigued by the Asus T100 for weeks. I read reviews and comments. I made an Amazon Wish List around it. I watched it go out of stock. Finally I saw one in a big store.\nI found the on-off button from the readings, and my wife pressed it for a while. The screen said C Drive was being repaired. It's hard being a store demo. The Metro came up.\nI put my hands on the keys, at last, and they weren't happy. My fingers were closer together, a tiny but noticeable amount, like not being able to stand up straight.\nThe comments warned about the track pad. I've never used one without buttons. My wife figured out to firmly double tap it. When I did that the cursor jumped.\nShe opened Mail, and we didn't know how to close it. We are ignorant of Windows 8 and 8.1. Instead of swipes we were trying taps on the touch screen. She figured out using the Windows key.\nI opened the Desktop and Explorer, but then couldn't double tap either the trackpad or the screen to close it. I bumped the cursor around.\nI separated the tablet from the dock and put them back together, and lost function of the cursor and key input. My wife pushed the parts together firmly and function was restored.\nShe tried to cure me of my infatuation, by showing me a Kindle tablet, an Android tablet, and a Logitech keyboard for iPad.\nI still think about the T100, but the feeling lingers in my fingers."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I was expecting to write a 5 star review for this tablet. It completely failed to meet my expectations. I bought this device because most of the tablets on the market such as the ipads and androids have limited functionality. Windows 8 pro on a tablet for only 400$? Sounded like a bargain to me. Asus is ripping us off. Other than the fact that the device is made of cheap material (I didn't really mind that), there are more serious issues with this device.\n\n Let's start with the keyboard dock. The keyboard dock seems very fragile. It feels like something that will easily break within a couple months. I didn't really mind its cramped size (I have small hands so I was able to type pretty fast on it). I also didn't have much trouble with the touch pad. Yes, it does lag from time to time but it's really not too big of an issue, especially once you play with the settings. The biggest issue I found with the dock is that it easily disconnects from the tablet. Unless the dock is on a hard surface, it will NOT connect to the tablet. You will have to push the tablet very hard into the dock and you might just break it while doing that. If you're thinking of using this tablet on desktop mode without the dock, forget about it. If you're just going to use the tablet version of windows on this device, you might as well get the surface rt.\n\nOther than the keyboard dock, I just hate the feel of the screen. It feels hard and sticky. Typing on the onscreen keyboard isn't pleasant. Which is why a good keyboard dock is essential. Even the screen on my original kindle fire feels better. Basically, this device fails as a tablet and as a laptop.\n\nOnly thing I really liked about this device was windows 8 pro, the sound, and the battery. The battery really does last all day. Despite my issues with the keyboard dock and the screen, I was willing to keep the device. So, what happened?\n\nWell, I was using it this morning and it just froze up. I had to turn it off. Ever since then, it has not been able to reboot.\nIt freezes at the ''Preparing automatic repair screen.'' If it wasn't for this I'd have at least rated this 3 stars. But what good is a dead tablet? I will be requesting a return as soon as possible. I'll be much more careful in my next purchase.\n\nI've had a lot of laughs reading one star reviews. I never thought it would happen to me.\n\nUpdate: I think I've figured out the problem. I was blaming Asus but this is really Microsoft's fault. What's crashing these computers is windows 8 updates. I bought a new laptop and it froze while updating. I turned it off and it got stuck at the loading screen trying to update, just like the Asus. Fortunately since it was a laptop I was able to get to the recovery screen and refresh the operating system. Since then I've permanently disabled all windows updates and haven't had any issues. I'm sure the same would work on the asus BEFORE windows updates crash it. Despite this however, I still think this is a 2-3 star device at best and wouldn't buy it again even if the price dropped to $250 because of the issues I listed above. I would give it another star but I think its current average (3.6 out of 5) is way too generous."}

WHY WOULD YOU BUY A SURFACE 2?? first of all the surface 2 has windows RT, NOT full version of windows 8.1, GET READY FOR RESTRICTIONS AND INCOMPATABILITY with the surface!! plus, you have to buy the keyboard seperately with the surface...so not only do you spend 100-150 more for the surface alone, then you have to purchase the keyboard at an extra 100-125 dollars!! your into the surface RT at about 600 dollars at that point, and your going to be very dissapointed with it!!\n\nOK, Phew...now lets talk about the NEW ASUS Transformer Book T100TA.\n\nI did a lot of research on this baby, and in the end it was a simple, easy decision to make on purchasing it. here are the Pro's of this little Gem:\n\nFull version windows 8.1, very solid!\nFull version office 2013 with license included!\nQuad core baytrail atom processer x86 compatabilty for legacy software and hardware etc...\nIncluded docking station and keyboard at no extra cost!\nUSB and Micro USB connections, along with micro sd slot, and HDMI ports\nDid i mention full version of windows 8.1, NOT RT!?\n\nFolks, i cant stress this enough...DONT BUY AN RT MACHINE! you will be so disappointed! right now the Vivo Tab RT 32gb is the same price as the T100 32 GB...and its a year older, and again, its an RT Machine!! hate hate hate RT!!! don't do it to yourselves!! get full version of windows and office...\n\nNow a few little cons, there aren't many:\n\nok, the screen isn't as crisp and sharp as you may want it, but it does have a respectable 1368 x 768 Resolution, definitely acceptable for this low cost of a machine.\nThe trackpad could use some improvements on touch sensitivity, sometimes i find myself sliding across it 2-3 times to move the mouse, but only sometimes...\nI cant think of anything else i don't like about the machine...\n\nAll in all, this little hybrid/tablet/laptop at the price, is unbeatable by anything out there comparable. you will NOT be disappointed in what you get with the price you pay for this...again im giving you one more warning, do not spend 250 dollars more on the surface 2, just to be totally and utterly DISAPPOINTED! go out and get you an Asus Transformer T100TA, THE BEST TABLET/NOTEBOOK/HYBRID ON THE MARKET TODAY!"}

My research suggested that  the ASUS T100 was bang-for-the-buck top of the class, and after spending the cash, I can report, the T100 is a winner. The fact is from Amazon Prime, for $379+$3.99 next day delivery, I got a Intel powered, Windows 8.1, tablet-laptop convertible, with 64GB storage, touch IPS display, that integrates with the Windows world I've been building since 1986.  OK, so the T100 is NOT a roaring beast, but from its position, hands reach from my recliner that sits in front of big screen TV, it is a useful power tool: for browsing, shopping, communicating, and viewing streaming video.  As for the roaring PC beast, it sits in another room, ready for use when I need to do some real work. Importantly T100 brings no surprises,,, it is a Windows 8.1 tablet with keyboard dock that works good, does all the stuff I expect from a computer in 2013, and has a friendly form factor.

The hardware is everything I expected and I wonder if some of the QA concerns posted earlier were on a particular early shipment.  The reason I think that is that some of the early reviews talked about the non-functioning Windows icon at the bottom of the display; my T100 does not even have the windows icon. I have also found the hardware to be very solid feeling and well built; the track pad does have a slight delay sometimes; however, it isn't something that I haven't already gotten used to.  The new ATOM Bay Trail processor runs extremely well.  This is my first experience with Windows 8 and that has taken some getting used to; but once I got familiar with how it works I really like a lot of the functionality (ASUS did pin a detailed users manual to the task bar of the traditional desktop; and it covers a lot about Windows 8...Thank you ASUS).  I think that the ASUS T100 is one of the best values out there and I do not hesitate recommending it."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "If you're just looking for a tablet for playing games, web browsing, social media and music and videos, there are better options than this available.  If you are looking for a notebook for running mainstream business apps, such as MS Office, there are also better options than this.  However, if you're looking for something that lets you do both, and at a very attractive price point, this is a great device for you.\n\nFirst, you get full Windows 8.1 (32-bit), instead of Windows RT.  This means you can run many legacy x86 Windows desktop applications.  Also, you get  full-featured Internet Explorer 11, which helps make up for the lack of Modern UI apps currently available in the Windows Store.  You can install Java, Shockwave, and other plugins. Built-in Adobe Flash allows you to watch video from services like Amazon Instant Video, YouTube and Vudu, which don't currently have apps available for them.  There are apps for some popular services, such as Facebook, Twitter, Netflix and Kindle.  Also, since this is true Windows 8.1, driver support for devices such as printers won't be a problem.\n\nAlso, with the quad-core Bay Trail Atom Z3740 processor, 2GB of memory and solid state storage (I strongly recommend the 64GB version), performance is much improved over past netbook-sized PCs.  MS Office 2013 apps open quickly (Home and Student, with full-featured Excel, Word, PowerPoint and OneNote, is included).  3D games from the Windows Store, like Hydro Thunder, play great on the T100.  Xbox 360 controller support is also a plus.  Connectivity on the tablet is decent, with micro USB, micro HDMI, and MicroSD slots, as well as a 3.5mm stereo headphone/speaker jack.  Finally, battery life on the T100 is great.  It's advertised at 11 hours.  I haven't checked the life on mine, but it has lasted noticeably longer than the ASUS TF700 Android tablet that it replaced.\n\nThe included keyboard/touchpad dock adds to the value of the tablet, since this is an extra cost on other tablets, although it has taken some getting used to.  The dock adds a full-sized USB 3.0 port, which gives you a lot of device connectivity options, including high-speed USB to Gigabit Ethernet adapters, and external hard drives, with USB 3.0's fast data transfer rate.  The keys on the keyboard are small, so those with large hands may have some frustration using it, and the touchpad leaves something to be desired.  You can connect a Bluetooth or USB keyboard or mouse (or both, with a USB hub).\n\nAt this price point, it's not surprising that ASUS had to make some compromises in the T100.  The case is plastic, rather than metal cases other tablets, such as the Apple iPad or Microsoft Surface 2, use.  This does make it feel somewhat cheaper than a metal cased tablet, at least to me.  The tablet and keyboard dock both do feel sturdy, however.\n\nAlso, the resolution on the 10.1\" display is only 1366x768, while other tablets have 1920x1080 and higher resolutions.  It's definitely not the equal of the Super IPS+ 1920x1200 display in my Transformer Pad Infinity, or the 2048x1536 resolution of the iPad's Retina display.  However, it's good enough for me, given the versatility of the T100.\n\nThe T100 isn't the best at any single thing it does, but when you combine everything you get, especially for the price, it's the best value in a Windows tablet/small notebook right now, in my opinion, and is worth looking at if you want one device for business apps, multimedia content, web browsing, social media and tablet gaming.  If the Windows Store continues to improve in its selection of quality apps, this will become an even better value."}

It may not have full HD resolution, but I guarantee you won't notice the difference.  The display is super vivid and sharp.  The keyboard is a little smaller, but that is to be expected with a tablet.  I think the other reviewers are comparing this to a full size laptop.  This is not a laptop  but has all the features of a laptop in a very compact, portable size.  It weighs about 2 pounds with the keyboard/cover.  I especially enjoy the large 10.1 display, and ease of use.  I use a stylus pen that I purchased for $10 to swipe and tap.  It keeps the screen free of finger prints.  I never got used to using a touch pad, not even with a laptop, so I connected a mouse using Bluetooth.  Now I have all the functionality of a desktop in a tablet.  My primary reason for purchasing this tablet is to take my work with me.  I am now able to access all my Excel files through SkyDrive, so a large hard drive is no longer an issue.  The 32 GB hard drive on this tablet is more than sufficient.  Now lets talk price.  With all its features, I only paid $340.  Dells Venue comparable tablet with a keyboard is over $700.  Microsoft Surface 2 Pro is over $1000 with a keyboard.  The Microsoft Surface 2 RT is not a full functional Windows product, so theres no comparison.  The Surface 2 has many limitations, including Office.  You cannot run macros with Windows RT.  The Asus Transformer Book has the full version of Windows 8.1, so you can run applications like Java.  It is the perfect tablet for access to the Internet, Netflix, email, music and games.  You get full functionality of Office, and you can even set this device up with Google Chromecast.  Just install the Chrome browser.  Buy the TV adapter for $35 and you can wirelessly connect this tablet to your HDTV.  I know I must sound like a salesperson for Asus or Google, but I can assure you I am not.  I am just so impressed with this product, that I cannot say enough about it.  The bottom line:  The features are right.  The feel of this product is right.  And most importantly, the price is right."}

My connection was still up, so I closed it, reconnected, and after several more minutes of seeming inaction I was informed that I was 'Good to Go'.  However, the process did NOT create either shortcuts on the standard window or a charms on the metro window for Word, Excel, or Powerpoint.

A lot of it is bloatware but you can free up around 10GB of bloatware that comes on it..Another downfall of it is the screen brightness. It can be fixed with a patch made later on in the near future to allow the screen to become a little bright because I'm sure the technology for it to become brighter is definitely there. It's quick to boot. Even though it's built like a laptop first and tablet second, it's functions as a tablet beautifully. The reading mode that Asus was so kind to include allows for late night reading as was as reading for extended periods of times.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "First of all, let me preface this review by stating that I have been waiting for an affordable Windows tablet for what seeems like forever. Therefore, when I heard about the Asus Transformer T100, it's safe to say that I was pretty excited. In fact, I nearly became obsessive about the device, eagerly waiting for the moment when I could get my hands on one.\nThat moment arrived two days ago.\nWhile this might not be the greatest laptop-tablet combination in the world, for what I need it for, it's damned near perfect. I've installed several word processing programs on it, and I've discovered that I have small enough fingers to where I can get some decent typing speed under me when I'm using the device. The issues that others have with the trackpad really haven't cropped up with me. Sure, they might show their ugly little heads down the line, but for now, they are keeping a low profile.\nThe sound quality is impressive for the size and the price, and the wireless connectivity is perfect. The screen resolution works just fine for me, and so far, every program that I've installed has worked flawlessly.\nSo, in the end, I'd have to say that the Asus Transformer T100 is pretty much everything that I'd hoped it would be."}

I installed desktop apps like google chrome and a video editor on it, runs smooth. My wireless mouse and keyboard works fine on the included USB port. Microsoft office comes free with the product. Micro hdmi allows me to connect to tv, works without a lag.\n\nI am super happy with my tablet, so glad that i bought this one."}

Wife IPad 2 user gave my mini to her after using this heavily for week.\n\nPros.  Great battery life.  Full windows productivity, keyboard at this price, and does all my consumer entertainment easily with one product.  Excited for next gen products.  USB 3 (with keyboard attached only) Micro storage slot.  Surprising sound with this form factor and price.  Keyboard useable.  WiFi use and LTE tethering without issue.  Not gaming format but plays a lot of older games without issue.\n\nNeg.  Keyboard not great, track pad poor but for this price still more on the plus side.  Charge time slow and through micro USB only.  Lack of programs in comparison to Android and IPad, but things will be changing there after this.  Windows battery monitoring still sucks for users versus competitors.  Light on main storage go 64, wish had more.  Windows button weird spot.  Micro SD card sticks out too far.  Awkward positioning with keyboard but nit picking here.  Front camera only.  Glossy plastic finger print magnet.\n\nNot 5 stars for many but for now hits sweet spot for tech and use for me.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "This has got to be one of the best tech values besides the Nexus 5 and Nokia 520. Fro $350-400, you get a FULL FEATURED 10 inch Windows 8 tablet that comes with a keyboard dock! Tablet one second, netbook the other! Its a fantastic device that gets 5 stars for its superb value alone!\n\n+ Great screen! People online may gripe on the 720p display, but you'll never notice using it\n+ Battery life: Took it off the charger 7am this morning, and been using it straight since browsing the internet, viewing several Youtube videos both on Flash and Metrotube app, reading PDFs with Bluetooth and Webcam on. Now at 4pm, and still have 40% on the tank! Definetly liberating from netbooks where under clocking underpowered devices was a necessity to get that battery life. About as good as my iPad.\n+The Speakers! As an iPad owner, I'm impressed. Very clear and very loud. definitely betrays their size. I've never had reason to crank it up past 50% so far.\n+ FULL WINDOWS 8.1! This can't be said enough. I think almost everyone who has bought a Netbook did so to get a full Windows experience in a relatively portable format, where I do not feel afraid to use the device on a subway, and doesn't require me to bring a charger.\n+ This things a BEAST for its size. Wana watch a flash Youtube video while browsing the net on the same screen? No problem! Wana do some photo editing while watching said video? No sweat! Everything is buttery smooth on Bay Trail. Hell, it seems faster than my Core2Duo 2009 White Macbook that I've been using as my primary computer (very happily especially with Mavericks) for 4 years now.\n+ FREE DOCK!!!!\n+ MicroSD card slot: Format it so NTFS, and you have an additional 32-64GB Hard Drive, so space no longer becomes a big issue.\n\nHowever.......\n\n- The Dock: I REALLY want to like this thing. Truly. But its pretty terrible. The keyboard has the same configuration and size as my 1000HE, which I've been using regularly until recently (broken fan). But its for some reason a pain in the ___ to type on. I think its because the keys are recessed in to the case too far, and the boarders around the keyboard are too high. Makes it very awkward to type on. Keys are also a bit stiff, but I personally don't mind that too much. Also, like others are reporting, there's still Q/A issues with these: Bought it from BestBuy yesterday (32GB) so its a brand new batch. The space bar is already squeaking after just a days use. Now very difficult to type on. Gonna send it in for return.\n\nThe Touchpad is also pretty bad. However, there's a way to make it pretty decent:\n\n1- realize that Asus put some stupid power saving feature to turn off the touchpad after 10 seconds or so. When you wana use it, just tap on it and use it. Small 6/10 second thing, but it makes it much more bearable.\n\n2- On the Desktop, double click \"Asus Smart Gesture\" on the bottom right where the Dock is (where you see your Battery indicator). Go to \"Edge Gesture\" and TURN THAT SHAITE OFF!!! Whoever thought that was a good idea in the first place should be fired! This thing already has the ability to do gestures with the touch screen. What's the point in adding all these unusable gestures to such a small touchpad? Leave it alone! The only gesture it needs is 2 finger scrolling. The rest is pointless.\n\n3- After that, go to Mouse Settings on the Control Panel and crank up both touch sensitivity and scrolling speed.\n\nSo in conclusion, if you want a FULL 10 inch Windows Tablet that has a dock to use as a stand, case, and occasional keyboard, then get the Asus T100 without hesitation. Its perfect.\n\nIf, like me, you are looking to get one as a netbook replacement, then wait a bit longer. Either until Asus fixes their Q/A issues, for competitor models that WILL be coming, or ditch the Tablet part and wait for the eventual touch screen Bay Trail netbooks.\n\nIn my 1 day use, the tablet part adds to the Netbook experience. Complementing it with the fast processing and amazing battery life, this machine should be the Ultimate Computational Device.\n\nHowever, it isn't right now. My thumb is tired from hitting this squeaky space bar, so signing off!\n\nEdit: Just got back from Bestbuy to exchange the keyboard, and the overall response is much better. Think the keyboard was defective all around. If it holds up after the next few weeks, I'll bump it up to 4 stars. Still, be wary of the quality control issues on this product, and make sure you buy it from somewhere that has a very flexible return policy.\n\nEdit 2: Well, it's been a month and so far, so good! The new dock has shown no wear and is now holding up well. after about a month, it's staring to replace my iPad as a tablet. Not entirely, but it's getting there. 4:3 aspect ratio is still ideal for tablet browsing, and Windows store is sorely lacking apps...but considering that I never intended this little thing to replace my MacBook OR iPad, I gotta say Tablet internet Explorer has grown on me! And I haven't really touched my MacBook since getting this, as I am able to do all my editing fine with the T100.\n\nAnother thing to be wary of: The plastics in the tablet are cheap. No joke. I put it in my book bag with the dock snug in a relatively safe compartment. Never banged it, or dropped it, etc. took it out, and found a very small crack on the side of the tablet. It's very small and everything works perfect, but considering the amount of drops and damage I've done with my old Asus Netbook, it's a bit disappointing it's that brittle. When in use, get a case for the whole thing. AmazonBasics has a cheap $9 case for 10 inch tablets that fits well and gives good enough protection."}

Third gripe was performance.... somewhat sluggish.\n\nHave kept my original Surface Pro and replaced the t100 with a Dell Venue 8 64 Gig. There is no comparison between the Dell Venue 8 and Asus t100... the Dell has a MUCH better screen; much snappier performance, and charges in less than 3 hours.\n\nSo, the t100 looks like a bargain, but it is not.\n\nDon"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I preordered the Asus Transformer T100TA just an hour after it went up here on Amazon.  I've been following this specific tablet since it was announced and was excited to try it out.  This is the first tablet I've owned but I'll try and give a comprehensive review based on my experiences with it.\n\nFirst off, I'll go over the problems I've had with it.  If I had reviewed this tablet a couple days ago I probably would have given it 2 or 3 stars due to two problems that were occurring.  The first has to do with the volume rocker.  When I pressed down on the volume rocker, it would act as though I were holding it down and reduce the volume down to 0 unless I pressed up on the rocker.  It was a strange issue and I figured I had received a defective unit.  I opened up a case with Asus, just in case there was a simple fix, and low and behold, I was informed to download the latest audio drivers from Asus, and this completely fixed the problem.  The second issue is with sleep mode.  It seems like when the dock is attached and I close the unit like a netbook, it doesn't go into sleep mode and I'll come back half a day later and a huge chunk of the battery life will be gone.  I haven't bothered looking for any windows settings to change this, one might exist.  Now I just use the keyboard hotkey (fn+f2) to put it to sleep before closing it and this seems to work fine.\n\nBuild quality of the unit is what you'd expect for the price.  I'm not crazy about the glossy plastic back, but at least the pattern is good looking.  The buttons on the tablet portion have a good click to them and I haven't seen any issues with them other than the software issue I described above.  I feel like the dock has a higher build quality as far as materials go than the tablet itself.  Its plastic, but a mat plastic rather than glossy with a brushed metal texture on the inside that I really appreciate.  The connection from the dock to the tablet is solid, the only beef I have with it is it's a little wobbly (I can rock it forward and back a little bit without actually rotating the pivot point of the connection).  The biggest disappointment like many have said is the track pad.  Basically it sucks and I only use it when necessary.  That being said, I hate track pads anyways so even if it was fantastic I probably would be using it anyways.\n\nThe keyboard on the doc is pretty small, and honestly feels a little awkward.  That being said, if I ignore the awkwardness I end up typing just as fast/efficiently as with a full sized keyboard (I type around 80 wpm on the tablet and my desktop keyboard, which I feel is a pretty average speed).  The keys on the keyboard themselves feel really nice, and overall I love the dock keyboard.\n\nThe camera/mic are a standard affair imo.  They remind me of the average laptop front facing webcam/speaker.  Not very high quality image/audio, but good enough to video chat.  Just make sure to wear headphones if your chatting if you don't want to get hardcore echoing on the mic.\n\nI was really impressed by the speakers on this thing.  I've never put them above 40% as that seems to be good enough to fill up the surrounding area even when I'm sharing audio with someone else.  Definitely better than any laptop speakers I've had the pleasure of using.\n\nAs far as computing power goes, you probably won't be playing any newer 3d games on this thing.  I do a little bit of game development as a hobby in my spare time and even some of the simple games I make run pretty slow on this guy.  That said, 2d games seem to run smoothly on it and I was even able to get Portal 1 to work at a playable frame rate.  I'm mostly using this guy for some media consumption and some light programming on the go though, so it's perfect for my uses.  All the Apps on it run really smoothly and the only hangups I've had are with the metro internet explorer app freezing, which I'm hoping is software issue rather than a hardware one and will be fixed (it feels weird using IE after so many years, but honestly IE 9 is pretty slick in metro and even has a little bit of WebGL support, so they seem to be trying to catch up).\n\nOverall I'm very satisfied with this product, and if you want a budget windows 8 tablet, I would recommend this guy 100%."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "Pros\n\n1. Price. When compared to other tablets, none comes close to this one which is full window, 10.1in screen size(bigger screen=better for full window experience imo), and keyboard dock\n2. Office included.\n3. Battery life is indeed better than your average laptop/tablet. Able to stay on 7+ continuous usage.\n4. Everything's responsive. Expected entry-performance, and that's exactly what I got. Able to do most flash-heavy websites I enjoy such as hulu, amazon prime videos, Daily Show/Colbert report, etc, which are not available on android/apple tablets(officially anyway).\n5. Tablet and keyboard docks and perform fine. Easy to snap on/off, and keyboard feels clicky just like real keyboard.\n6. Tablet DOES support micro USB to full USB file transfer, as long as you use an adopter. It's not just for charging.\n7. Not having a capacity touchbutton for window is a good thing for me, since holding it vertically in tablet mode prevents me from hitting the window button by accident.\n8. Loud speaker, and sound still comes from around the tablet. So ff tablet is set down face-up, sound still comes the bottom of the tablet(I think).\n9. Harddrive and RAM/memory has been no issue for me. Out of the box, it has about 35/49gb of  flasdrive space available, and uses .7/1.9gb of ram/memory. If you get 16gb model, you'll have 15gb of free flashdrive storage(from what I read)\n\nCons\n\n1. Random nonresponsive after charging. When I plug the charger before going to bed, it becomes nonresponsive with black screen and I'm forced to hold the powerbutton for 10~ seconds to shut it down, and reboot. Not sure if there will be updates to fis this\n2. Slow charging. Since it only uses microUSB to charge, don't expect the battery percentage to rise during usage/charging(but won't go down either). It'll charge in sleep-mode however.\n3. Not powerful enough to play most 3D games. I tested Lead4Dead 2 and it was barely playable at lowest resolution(15-20~ FPS). This is expected however. Good enough to play touchscreen games from Window stores though.\n4. Touchpad is small, but still very usable.\n5. Small touchpad and small keyboard, but fully expected. It's what you would normally get from a 10.5in tablet.\n6. Only 1 full USB port, which is only from keyboard dock. If tablet has full Window support, tablet itself really should have its own full USB imo.\n7. Poor standby battery consumption. I only few things installed(Chrome, printer, etc), and it still drains battery at 2-5% per hour. Any tablet/laptop shouldn't drain more than 1% per hour during sleep mode imo(even if syncs are on). BUT since this is full window, malwares/spyware/virus/etc could be the culpit. Be careful what you install from your browser.\n8. Window 8. Touchscreen can't mimic what touchpad/mouse can do, such as pointer-hovering and selecting texts. Still this is MS problem, not the tablet/Asus.\n9. No active digitizer screen(whatever it means, since I'm a casual consumer), making this no good for college notetaking or drawing. You can still use a stylus with rubber ends, but it's really not responsive\n\nSome advices\n1. TURN OFF ALL GESTURES ON YOUR TOUCHPAD. Since it's really small, it'll easily trigger most gestures. Main troublemaker is the up-down gesture, which will make the touchpad feel unresponsive when it actually isn't.\n2. I suggest turning off auto-brightness sensor. Sensor is located near the front-cam. Since this is mainly a tablet and a secondary tablet, your thumb could cover the sensor in vertical tablet mode, which could dim the bridgeness when you don't want to. It's easy to change the brightness manually by swiping from the right side, setting, screen.\n\nOverall it performs what I expected from the price point. Although browsing experience lags here and there, it still performs fine in the end. I guess its main selling point is the included keyboard dock, which could cost $50-100 on its own IF it were available for other tablets in the market(or you can just use non-dockable 3rd party keyboard). And for any full window tablets(non-RT), I believe that docking keyboard is the only way to enjoy them."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I've owned the device for about a week now and have been fortunate to not experience the other issues I've read about with some other customer reviews.  I was initially worried about this when ordering the tablet, but I figured, as with most things, the most vocal are the ones with negative experiences so wanted to share my positive.\n\nAs a device, this tablet is outstanding!  It's everything I wanted with Android and iOS tablets but could never have.  I think for non-technical or average tech people, those devices offer a simple interface with just as much as needed to do what you need.  The T100 offers this and with the Metro interface, offers a simplified approach to apps and media consumption as well.  The difference here is that underneath, there is a full fledged and powerful OS that can accommodate most moderate or power user needs as well.\n\nUp front, I bought this device primarily to play games on.  For those in the same situation, you have to realize what you are getting with the price.  While this does play games like Crysis or Skyrim, it won't play these as well if compared to something like a powerful PC rig.  However, when compared to the other devices, I can play games like Half-Life 2, TorchLight as well as other AAA quality titles as well as those offered in the Microsoft App store.  The T100 handles these well and offers the ability to play games with the right tools when needed.  Being able to plug in a 360 controller, use the touchscreen or play with a keyboard/mouse is perfect for most games and doesn't force you to comply to just using the touchscreen for non-touch centric games.\n\nAs for the device itself, I have gotten an average of 8 - 11 hours depending on the activities done.  Gaming takes away battery life, but 8 hours is more than sufficient on the go.  The keyboard has been perfect for me as a user that doesn't have Andre the Giant fingers.  The only minor shortcoming is the touchpad which does incur a slight wake up delay, but is there when you need it as well.\n\nIn a nutshell, I love this device.  Out of all the different tablets I've owned, this has by far exceeded my expectations.  It does everything I need for productivity.  Everything I need for entertainment/gaming and does it all in a world of silence (no fans).\n\nI think Windows 8 coupled with the power of Bay Trail could be the best evolutionary combo and future iterations of devices should only get better.  I love this thing!"}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I really want to love this convertible.  In terms of speed and performance with regards to gaming and video, this convertible has met all of my expectations.  I'd just mirror the positive reviews from others.\n\nI got past the Microsoft Office installation issues - I wouldn't worry about the concerns other reviewers have had.  The workaround is pretty minor.  By stopping the print spooler and setting it to manual, Office installed great the first time.\n\nThe one concern I have, I believe matches other reviewers comments about their tablet not waking up.  I've occasionally had this problem, and I believe I've narrowed it down to the tablet not waking up from sleep when connected to power.  If disconnected, I can leave the laptop on sleep mode all day without issue - the screen will immediately light up ready to work within a second.\n\nUnfortunately - if I left my laptop charging during the day, when I return - I'll only get a black screen.  I can get the laptop to power cycle by holding the power button for over 20 seconds, but this is frustrating.  I'm also concerned that eventually - the laptop may refuse to power back up.  I hope Asus or someone else comes up with a fix quick - because otherwise I'm considering a return.\n\nIf this were settled - I'd have no problem rating this 5 stars.  It may not be perfect, but it exceeds expectations for price point.  But the uncertainty about whether the laptop will power back on, and what data might be lost - makes this a potentially fatal flaw.  I've already tried refreshing the laptop to no avail."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "This review contains my impressions after a few weeks of the product's use and what options might be considered.\nThis is a solid product that offers good tablet experience. The screen is adequate and responsive. The computer itself is really fast. Boot times are fast as well as shutdowns. I am not a big gamer but I played some market place games and they run fine. Most likely, games that are designed for desktop would have some delay. However, the tablet runs all applications including office without any problems. Video, including HD, runs very smoothly on the device as well. Battery life of the device is as promised or may be even better. I was able to run the device for whole day, about 14 hours total on and off use, without charging and still had 20% left. I watched a few HD movies, browsed the Internet on and off, spend a few hours on my homework, and played a few games. This is exactly what I need out of any tablet.\n\nOf course, what makes it all happen is Windows 8.1, and it is a very good improvement over version 8. I like the changes they made and SkyDrive integration is very welcomed. On the other note, I do like reading mode application provided by Asus. I did uninstall all other Asus apps.\n\nHowever, there are few things that I don't like about this machine. Windows button is strangely positioned on the side by the volume rocker. There is usual windows logo on the bottom of the device but it does not do anything. I might have gotten a defective device but that is how it functions. I am still planning to look into it. Enabling hard drive encryption made the computer to stop working and I had to reinstall everything. I need to ask Microsoft about that.\n\nThere are options of what you can buy instead of this device. You can go for Surface 2 or upcoming Nokia 2520. Surface has a nice screen but I don't like Win RT and Surface is slower, much slower. I was able to play with T100 and Surface 2 at a store and there was noticeable difference to how faster T100 is. Nokia 2520 has faster processor than Surface but it is yet to be seen. However still a mobile processor with Win RT. Of course, money is the issue. Surface 2 is $450 with 32GB of HD and no keyboard. It would cost close to $600 or even more to get similar configuration to T100, and all it would provide is higher screen resolution, but still slower performance. On the other hand, Nokia 2520 will offer LTE connectivity and that might be important, but any laptop/tablet can connect to the internet without extra fees by sharing phone connection. Nokia 2520 will have a really nice screen, but at supposedly $500 it will only offer 32 GB of HD and no keyboard. That is why it will cost around $600-$650 to get similar configuration to what T100 offers for $400. All it will provide is LTE connectivity, much nicer screen, nice design and perhaps similar performance, but still Win RT. Next in line is Dell Venue 11. It looks very promising and might be a really good choice. The price was just lowered to $500 for the base configuration that will offer 64 GB of HD and faster processor than T100. In addition it will include full HD screen.  However, it appears that the device is promised to have 8-10 hours of battery life and, with my previous Dell experience, we are looking at about 7.5 hours. However, I might be wrong. This tablet looks like a good choice at slightly higher price where you are looking to spend about $150-$200 to get similar configuration to T100 but better specs. The is one problem that stopped me from Dell Venue 11 is the size. I find 11\" form factor a bit uncomfortable and Dell weights 1.6 lbs vs. 1.2 for Asus. Dell Venue 8 looks good too but 8\" is kind of small for my needs, but a really good option for a tablet. I am sure many more are coming and may prove to be even better choices but T100 is a good tablet with good options at an attractive price point.\n\nIt is important to note that T100 is the lightest as the tablet out of presented choices, except for Venue 8."}

I cannot believe anyone would criticize this thing.  I guess its a mindset thing like \"apps\" are all the rage.  Who cares about apps when you can run real programs and visit real websites the way it should be.\n\nHands down one of the best purchases I have ever made.\n\nThis is my first review ever I had to do it.  Its that good.  Thank you ASUS!"}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "Pros: It has a full Windows 8 system so I can use all my legacy programs and things like Adobe work great. I am using this to basically replace my laptop. The tablet works like a dream and the keyboard is a god-send. There's no lag even when I run upto 5 apps at once. The snap feature is So Awesome. The reboot time is maybe 30 seconds. I am using the tablet as a netbook and I can get all my work done and have fun all at once. It's light and portable. The battery life is great. It is such a great tablet for productivity and for fun! I love it!\n\nCons: There are two reasons I didn't give it the full 5 stars - the keyboard mousepad is not the best. it is unresponsive at times and is super loud when it does work. The other reason is that the battery drains considerably on sleep mode. It's ridiculous. I can watch hours of netflix and be on facebook and work on papers and google things and it takes maybe 5% battery away. I leave it on sleep mode for a few hours and nearly 20-30% battery is gone! Not sure why this is. Also, battery recharge takes a long time, but if you sleep a few hours every night and don't mind plugging in the charger, you should be fine.\n\nAnother issue with the Asus T100 is that the tablet is a fingerprint magnet. And I have looked for covers that might work well in this instance and haven't yet found one that would let me do everything I need with my tablet without being awkward.\n\nOverall, great price for a great product. I am satisfied and would definitely recommend this product to others!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "This is a great machine.  For a PC user who simply refuses to buy into the Apple mind-think-cult, this tablet has everything I like about the iPad without the PC incompatibility issues and lack of obvious features that the Apple design gods refuse to incorporate into the iPad (microSD slot, USB port (mini port on the tablet and std size port on the keyboard), standard USB charger (separate micro USB port), detachable keyboard, etc.).  This tablet has a newly designed Atom quad-core processor that makes it run very fast but very cool and energy efficient.  I can confirm a 10+ hour run time on a full charge running streaming video over a wi-fi connection.  The touch screen is highly responsive, so much so that I've fumbled a few times and inadvertently brushed the screen lightly and caused it to react as if I deliberately touched it.  The keyboard and tablet integrate so well, mechanically and electronically, that you wouldn't know this is a tablet plus keyboard when they're connected.  The keyboard is small and cramped, as you can imagine, but works very well given its size constraint -- solid touch and construction. But the keyboard comes in really handy for both keeping the tablet screen standing up for hands-free viewing as well as banging out text on the keyboard when it's more convenient than using the touchscreen.  The touchpad works very well, it also has built-in left/right mouse buttons that also work well.  Windows 8 is a completely different experience from previous versions.  It is all about touchscreen tablets/computers and works well for that.  You will have to get used to finding things on the computer in a new way and this will annoy many.  But the positive tradeoff is an iPad-like experience.  Apps install and update seamlessly.  The tablet alone is very light, and the screen is both bright and very sharp.  The battery charges quickly - 2 Amp charger.  And one other thing, this tablet and keyboard will cost you hundreds of dollars less than competing products with similar features.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "The idea of having a Windows 8 convertible with 10+ hours of battery life with Office 2013 included for $400 seemed like a bad infomercial promise, but it turned out to be true for my purposes.  I was looking for a second computer that could do fairly basic Windows stuff and multimedia while also being very compact and having a long battery life.\n\nI had previously purchased an Atom-based Asus netbook that was atrociously slow and only lasted a few hours, plus the fan was annoyingly loud.\n\nHere are my findings:\n\nGOOD:\n- The T100 is as fast as you need a second computer to be.  MS Office runs smoothly, all videos play well and it's never slowed down terribly so far.  I haven't run any processor-intensive stuff yet like Photoshop or Crisis, but that's not why I purchased it.\n- The screen is rather nice.  It's an IPS WXGA screen, which pales in comparison to some 1080p phones, but for a 10.2\" netbook, it works well.  Text is readable and videos look great.  The brightness isn't spectacular and the reflectivity is high, but it's very crisp and the viewing angles are excellent.\n- There are no fans.  It runs cool.  It runs silent.\n- The speakers are better than my 17\" laptop.  Not great in the bass department, but they're loud.  I just wish they were facing forward instead of backward.\n- It's super light and compact.  I'm able to read holding just the screen and the whole package, including the keyboard, fits nicely into the Kensington tablet sling I just purchased.\n- The construction is solid.  Yes, the lid and screen are smudge-prone, but it's all solid state and thoughtfully arranged...for a $400 piece of hardware.\n\nBAD:\n- The WiFi is a bit wonky.  When I wake my computer, sometimes the WiFi won't work but when I just turn the laptop's WiFi antenna off and on, everything goes back to normal.\n- The charger is as slow as people are reporting.  Sometimes it charges fairly slowly, other times, not at all.  Still working that out.\n- The trackpad is annoying and unpredictable.  Once I turned off the tap-to-click feature, it was much more manageable except the trackpad clicks are conspicuously loud.  Remedied by a bluetooth mouse.\n\nOTHER THOUGHTS:\n- I appreciate the microSD slot.  I put in a 64GB chip and it works great.\n- Some have complained about the single-antenna WiFi, but it hasn't bothered me at all.  Streaming music and video is not a problem.\n- The tablet doesn't fit in immediately so you kind of have to wiggle it in so it will fit flush with the keyboard.\n- Windows 8.1 presents a learning curve.  It's also not the greatest OS for a tablet computer.  But once you get used to the quirks, it's not a dealbreaker.\n- The keyboard is small but totally usable.  With its weird layout and lack of backlighting, it's not great in the dark, but otherwise, it's fine.\n\nIN SUM:\nFor me, this computer does everything I expect it to do.  It's tiny, relatively fast and the battery life is tops.  That said, there are many idiosyncrasies that you must contend with.  WiFi, keyboard and charging require some fiddling, but maybe those things will be ironed out in future updates.\n\nAll in all, it's a great piece of hardware.  If you're looking for something that has the portability of a tablet but the functionality of a laptop for $400, it's an amazing deal that can't be beat.  For the price, there are better laptops and there are better tablets, but as a low-priced combo, it's a grand slam."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I have had many computers, laptops, and tablets. I bought this because I wanted the versatility of using this as a tablet or laptop. Because it runs the full Windows 8.1 operating system, I was particularly attracted to this unit. I have not been disappointed! The keyboard works very well and is very convenient. It has one USB port which is all I really need to use to plug in a portable drive, etc. I also bought a Bluetooth mouse which I like to use, although it isn't necessary to get one since the touchpad works fine. I just find it a little more convenient to use sometimes. Everything has worked well and I am very happy with it so far. I have had it for about one week. The only thing I would mention is that you must be careful to either use the touchpad or a mouse to hit the shutdown selection because if you tap the screen to choose the shutdown option it is very easy to think that you have shutdown the tablet when you actually have only put it to sleep, because the two options are right next to each other and when you touch your finger to the screen it is easy to hit the wrong option by mistake, whereas if you use the mouse pointer you will normally be more accurate. Also, if you don't leave the charging cord plugged into the tablet when it is only sleeping the battery will drain to zero. I also have found that even though I shutdown the tablet properly, sometimes it will not boot up when I press the power button and this was a little disconcerting at first. I had to hold down the power button until the little light next to the button shut off temporarily and then press the power button again. Then it will boot up. This usually happens when I have left the tablet charging overnight. When it hasn't been charging overnight, then it will usually boot up right after pressing the power button, (if it had been shutdown properly). This has been my only concern with the unit but I am really very happy with everything so far. It is really nice to be able to use applications on this tablet that also run on Windows 7, Windows Vista, and Windows XP. I have a Windows RT tablet and cannot use these applications on it. Considering the price and the versatility, I think that this is a very good deal."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I purchased this from a sale at MicroCenter last week and I had to return it after a few days of use.  Initially, there were a few things that bugged me, but for the price, I was willing to put up with.  Eventually, the system started crashing and I decided I should return it (instead of restoring the image) because I didn't want to have this happen again after the return period was up.\n\nThe issues I had with this machine are:\n\n1. The keyboard dock.  I'm OK with the fact that its a cheap keyboard and trackpad, but fitting the tablet into the dock was difficult.  It does not just slide in.  I felt like I had to \"jam\" it in to get the keyboard/trackpad to work.\n\n2. The microusb port.  The port to charge the device was awkward.  Several times, I had trouble fitting the charger into the port.  I had to turn on some lights and carefully align the cable into the port because it didn't seem to fit right (unlike my phone where it just slips in).\n\n3. When I closed the lid, apparently it didn't put it in sleep mode every time and it ran down my battery.\n\n4. Finally, after recharging the device, it would freeze while trying to start and doing a system repair did not fix it.\n\nI decided to get my money back and try a different brand.  I like that it had a full windows on it and office, but I may try a Surface 2.  I'd rather have a working machine with RT than a non-working full version of Windows."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "Ive had this computer for a week, and Ive been using it every day during that time as my desktop.  I didn't buy it as a desktop replacement, but rather as a portable desktop substitute for when I spend weeks or even months at another residence across the country.  However, using it as a full-time desktop during the past week has given me ample opportunity to enjoy its many attributes and get it setup for my next cross-country trek.\n\nI have had none of the problems reported by a few others.  From the moment I booted up the computer after its initial charge, it has worked perfectly.  Software updates and activations went smoothly.  Ive not had issues with screen flashes, reboots, or blue screens of death.  The wireless adapter works great, allowing me to communicate smoothly with other computers and peripherals on my home network.  I have no complaints about the build quality or the QA process involved in making this computer.  I do, however, have a few design complaints, though none of them would keep me from buying this device again.\n\nI knew the small keyboard would involve some compromises and a learning curve, and that has certainly proved correct.  The keyboard is a bit smaller than a fully size modelwhich I knew before buying it, thanks to the reviews of others--and it takes some getting used to.  I was willing to make that compromise in order to get a 10, highly portable Windows desktop, and after using it for a while, Im satisfied with that choice.  The more I use the keyboard, the easier it gets, so I think this issue will eventually work itself out.  Id take a small keyboard over no keyboard any day.\n\nThe short power cord is absurd.  It is so short that I cant even plug in the computer from a floor outlet while the computer is sitting on a tablenot unless I set the computer on the very edge of the table, making it unusable while charging.  Even then, the cord barely reaches the plug.  What was Asus thinking?  I solved the problem by buying a 6 charge cable to replace the one that came with the plug, and that works fine.  (If you go that route, be sure to buy a charge cable, not a data cable.)  The computer is extremely slow to charge, if you use it while charging.  Better to charge over night while you sleep.\n\nI also wish ASUS had included one more full size USB port on the keyboard.  For those of us who use a wireless mouse instead of the track pad, the only existing USB port is taken up by the mouse transmitter, leaving no open ports for something like a flash drive, which I use to carry around all my files from my desktop.  The micro USB port on the tablet can be used with an adapter (purchased separately), but that port is not available if you are charging while working.  So, the next solution is to buy a small USB hub, which I did.  Carrying around a hub would probably not be necessary if ASUS had simply included just one more full USB port on the other side of the keyboard dock.\n\nNow, on to the things I like a lot and why I chose this computer. . . .\n\nI have owned a number of Android and Apple devices, and while I enjoy them, I find them to be limited to entertainment and leisure activities.  When I travel for long periods of time I also need the ability to be productive.  For me, that means a portable Windows environment--something that I sorely lacked and which this little gem thankfully now provides.\n\nI have been able to set up this computer just like my desktop, with all the Windows-based programs that I routinely use, so that when I travel its just like having my desktop with me.  That means I run Word, Excel, Visio Pro, and Adobe Reader with regularity for personal productivity.  I also maintain my own website and use light photo editing and watermarking software.  I have not experienced any speed or performance problems while using those programs, and I often have several programs running at the same time.  Im not a resource-demanding gamer, and I don't use the computer for activities related to outside employment.  If I did either of those, I likely would have opted for a more robust machinepossibly the upcoming Dell Venue 11 Pro, which will cost significantly more for the same basic configuration, but will probably be faster and have options for a larger hard drive and more memory.  For my purposes, this computer will only see daily use when I travel, and thats usually only a few times a year.\n\nIm finding Windows 8.1 easier to use than the various Apple and Android devices I have, and Ive enjoyed customizing the Start menu to include all the programs I use for productivity, as well as some for travel and entertainment. The Start screen allows me to organize my programs in a way that makes them easy to find, and I like the instant start menu notifications included with many of the apps.\n\nIn terms of apps, there appears to be nothing of significance that I can do on my Apple or Android devices that I cant do on this computer, but, then, Im not a big apps person either.  I spent quite a bit of time in the Windows store, looking for apps, and I found everything I needed that didn't already come loaded by Asus.  I have read that others find the app selection for Windows devices poor, but I found it more than sufficient for my varied travel, entertainment, and personal productivity needs.\n\nBesides wanting a full Windows desktop replacement, I chose this particular machine for four reasons:  1) its light weight and small size make it highly portable, even with a keyboard attached; 2) it has better battery life than most other options, making it more convenient for travel; 3) the detachable tablet provides the option of ditching the keyboard for even more portability; and 4) all other contendersboth available now and soon to be releaseddo, or will, cost significantly more for the same capabilities.  For my purposes, the significant extra cost just didn't make sense.  This computer does what I need, so why pay more?\n\nWhen I was looking at this computer, I was a little worried about the small hard drive, but that issue was easily resolved by the purchase of a 128GB flash drive and a 64GB micro SD card.  I have seen comments that the micro SD card sticks out when inserted, but mine is flush with the outside edge of the tablet, making it no problem to leave in all the time.  I also purchased a small, lightweight USB hub and a micro-to-full-USB converter to allow me maximum versatility in communicating with other devices.  I created a car charger from a flexible, coiled micro-to-full USB charge cable and a dual car charger that meets the electrical specs for this computer (allowing me to charge this computer and my phone at the same time).  Add to that a really cute case, screen protector, mesh-tipped stylus, ultra-portable wireless mouse and pad, and a flexible USB data cable, and Im ready to hit the road and stay gone as long as I want without getting behind on anything."}

It does take a little getting use to with the new windows on it but I'm starting to really like it.  I love that it came with a keyboard and Microsoft office, two big items on my list of must haves. Out of the box it looked impressive.  I was a little disappointed there wasn't an instruction manual or even a quick start guide but there is one under apps and online it just took me a while to find it.\nThe screen detaches from the keypad really easily but is really sturdy when it is attached.  The keypad is small and takes some getting use to for typing a lot but again, I'm getting use to it.\nMy only complaint is the camera.  It takes pretty horrible pictures and there isn't a back lens so if you are trying to take  a picture you have to hold it at a weird angle.  I didn't get this for a camera  though so I didn't knock off any stars for that.  The screen quality is great!  Images and pictures online are really clear and vibrant.\nOh and the battery really does last all day.  It takes a while to charge so we just leave it charging overnight.  By morning we are at 100%, use it constantly between the four of us and it makes it until evening before needing charged again."}

Unlike the netbooks of old, the t100 never feels underpowered.  I glides effortlessly through all normal computing tasks.  The Intel bay trail cpu seems to be what Microsoft needed at the start...  It feels right at home as a tablet, and just as happy docked to the keyboard.  Having both options is where windows 8 comes alive.\n\nPros- The Price is beautiful.  I don't think you will find a better value out there.  The device itself feels solid.  It has enough weight to give confidence, while light enough to hold with one hand.  The Keys on the dock have a good feel and travel.  The hinge and connector feel very secure, with no play.  I have never worried about it.  When docked I forget it splits into two pieces.  The screen looks great and the touch works flawlessly.  Battery life is as advertised.  Tablet level life with an x86 platform.  Awesome.  Hook up the micro hdmi out to a monitor and plug a mouse in and you have a workstation.  While Subjective I think Asus designs nice looking devices, and the t100 looks good.  Oh and again... PRICE!\n\nCons- The glossy plastic on the back of the screen makes for a fingerprint magnet.  It looks nice and feels good in the hand, but be prepared to wipe it down constantly...I mean constantly.  The rocky start I mentioned was involving the keyboard dock.  I though I had a bad one at first.  The keyboard worked for a few minutes and just stopped.  This was during the first charging cycle.  After it was fully charged the keyboard came back to life.  I read that this happened to others.  Asus should include this info with the device because I almost shipped it back.  Seems to work just fine now though.  The touchpad is a little finicky.  Mostly when you have the gestures turned on.  Because it is so small just moving the cursor around the screen, you will use gestures.  Like swipe from right and cycle apps, or pull up the charms bar, when you're just moving the cursor.  2 finger scroll works for the most part but not all the time.  Pinch to zoom on the touchpad is also hit and miss.  It works though.  Would be nice to have a second usb on the dock, but I knew this going in.\n\nSo the t100 isn't perfect...So What!  It is a $400 ultra portable laptop... and tablet.  It is easily powerful enough to be the only computer most people need.  It has the battery power to last all day, No moving parts, Quad core x86 cpu, 1366x768 screen, Bluetooth, hdmi out, good build quality, all for $400.  What's not to like?"}

Well, I can only compare my disappointment to ...when you finally date that cute, fabulous person and then you discover they have a very bad breath. I hope you smile because there are too many sadder things in life;)\nI am not an IT person (some of you will say \"of course\" marking my review as \"not helpful\"). I am an average user who needed a very first tablet with a keyboard. Simply a second device to travel with, to browse internet, watch Netflix, writing emails and to type a lot. And Asus T100 seemed to be that perfect choice. I am a Windows person but old enough to use old school alt+F4, ctrl+c / v or x and other Norton Commander keyboard shortcuts. Therefore I need a keyboard since I think Win 8.1 touch screen only ....still needs an improvement. I will definitely miss Windows XP or Win 7 when they become completely not updateable. I am rather a technically conservative person who always used Dell PCs and Nokia phones. I have never been attracted to any apple core devices since I find i-gadgets simply faux-Bohemian. But I wanted to try this Asus product because times change. There is no Saab anymore and people fell in love for instance with Infinity cars. Yes, it is a metaphor and should not be taken literally. Generally, I consider T100 a perfect supplement to your first PC a/o laptop, bigger and more operable than your Smartphone. I chose T100 because of the price, because of having a keyboard and because of being a fantastic 2 in 1. Otherwise I would end up buying a tablet, an extra keyboard, an extra folio/cover/stand or sleeve.\n\nPROS:\n\nDesign: Very handy and sleek. I would even say comfy. It feels great both as a tablet and as a laptop.\n\nSize: Pretty ideal. Smaller than your first laptop yet bigger and better than your smartphone.\n\nWeight: Not too light but also not too heavy delivering a sense of sturdiness and comfort.\n\nSpeed: Truly fast. Quick and responsive. Very fast web browsing, loading quickly even heavy loaded websites.\n\nKeyboard: I love it. It resembles me in size the Dell Mini 10v. Responsive. Sturdy but I also have small hands so perhaps I am not objective.\n\nBattery: An absolute winner. Amazing, simply incomparable battery life.\n\nPrice: Simply unbeatable. Not to mention free MS Office although I had no chance to use it.\n\nAVERAGE: screen. Not bad at all but not a killer. Actually nice for the price paid.\n\nCONS:\n\nHardware/software issues: I was unable to complete MS Office installation. PC tablets with the latest MS Office are being advertised as \"you can have your office anywhere working, printing, downloading\" etc. Well, I was not even able to have a desk in my \"new office\":( I do not blame MS for that. If there are so many issues with MS Office installation (please read the other reviews), ASUS should simply recall those T100s and fix the problem. It is a big \"no, no\" when people are trying to install and use something truly basic. For the first impression there are no second chances. And, I apologize, but I am not going to call and spend hours with Asus help desk trying to fix that. Especially that during the installation, the unit froze, then switched off and I was not even able to restart it or to reboot it. The start button was unresponsive and the screen was black with occasional semi-blinks like being about to restart. Yes, the battery was 100% full before I started the installation.\n\nCamera: 1.2 MP is like having a nice, brand new 2014 convertible with a ...0.6L engine. No rear camera. If it is supposed to be a real tablet and we are in 2013, it should have two cameras and not just the front one. Even my smartphone has both. It should be a versatile device: not for Skype only, but also for taking pictures or shooting videos. Of course it saved money, keeping the price under $400 but a compromise should not mean compromising.\n\nConclusion:\n\nI am not saying a definite NO to it. And this is why I am leaving 3 stars. Furthermore if I do not find a working (flawlessly) clone of it... I may even buy it again. I will just wait couple of months when the T100 series gets improved. I am glad I have bought it directly from Amazon so there is no headache with returning it. Please check if a third party seller accepts returns \"no questions asked\". It will save you time...and money."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "Summary: Great 2-in-1 for the price. Best suited for hybrid - not predominantly laptop - usage. Some annoying hardware quirks.\n\nWhy I Chose It: I have a 45min train commute each way. I use that time to write longer emails (since I'm uninterrupted), review and edit Office documents, and - what I'll call - \"content sort\": go through a list of RSS & twitter feeds, websites, online journals, etc. and sort appropriate material for different actions via email, Pocket, and Trello. Sometimes I prefer doing that last task in lean-back/tablet mode. So I needed something with good battery life; very light; probably a hybrid, not a straight laptop; lap-comfortable (so no Surface); and compatible with an Office-centric workflow.\n\nI've been using an original Yoga 11 for several months. That form factor, portability, and battery life were big pluses for me. I knew the limitations of Windows RT, but was getting tired of my workarounds. If there were a Bay Trail Yoga 11, I'd very likely have bought that.\n\nI won't cover W8.1 (the overviews at arstechnica and winsupersite are very good), but there are a few key notes vis--vis the T100 from a productivity standpoint: the inclusion of MS Office (across the board for tablets under 11\"); vastly improved Mail app; more seamless multi-tasking (e.g. opening a Mail attachment will auto-split the screen and open it in the next panel); more customizable start screen (which doesn't seem important at first, but becomes very useful as you optimize the start screen for your particular work flow). I'll also mention here that I too had a poor \"out of the box\" experience, with some of the \"infinite boot cycle\" and instability issues others have mentioned. From my own troubleshooting, it seems like these might be Windows 8/8.1 issues more broadly, so I didn't deduct a star for that.\n\nN.B. - Price is heavily factored in all the below. I might have bought a higher-priced version/competitor that addressed my few negative observations (e.g. the Dell Venue 11 isn't available yet and it looks like the Haswell-powered Yoga 11s hasn't dramatically improved the battery life).\n\nBuild: Largely good. It looks more refined and better in person. I've used it fairly heavily for almost 2 wks, and everything feels tight and solid. The glossy back finish of the tablet is a major fingerprint magnet, and the soft-touch, rubbery material on the keyboard's underside is much, much better. On close inspection, you'll see some gap and alignment inconsistencies, but no more than on almost anything that isn't from Apple or the high-end lines of a PC maker. And there has to be a better way to execute the MicroSD card slot: the card sticks out *just enough* to cause an occasional accidental eject. Anandtech's review has a good point: we know Asus can do Apple-level build quality for low price points (both generations of Nexus 7), and it's a little disappointing to see that, without a Google-like pushing, that it's missing here.\n\nScreen: I'm one of the few folks that's fine with the 1366x768 resolution. Until everything is available and runs/scales well in the Modern UI, full HD (or more) in desktop mode on a 10.1\" screen might be unusable for most users, even when scaled up. I would love another 100nits of brightness, and better color calibration, but they got the main things right: multi-touch response is perfect; great wide IPS viewing angles; relatively unobtrusive auto-brightness; build quality is nice - no backlight bleeding, or obvious gaps between the panel's layers. As a stand-alone tablet, it's very light, and easy to hold and navigate. Both its light weight and its distribution make it relatively \"1-hand-able\" in portrait mode.\n\nKeyboard: Mostly good, within reason. I think Asus optimized the limited  space/layout as much as possible. I'd have made a different compromise re: the shrunken right shift button (every !, @, #, $, and % ends up being very deliberate), but YMMV. Tactile feedback and key travel is surprisingly good. The tablet dock/hinge has very modest recline. Fully reclined, it's fine on my lap (i.e. - adding another few degrees of recline); but flat on a desk, it may be too upright for most people to use for longer stretches. The tablet \"clicks\" in and out of the keyboard easily, and there's virtually no wobble.\n\nTouchpad: More problematic. The smaller size is understandable, but there's a combination of an overly aggressive sleep setting and/or poor (or no) palm rejection that causes erratic response. This is somewhat less of an issue with a netbook-sized device, where it's fairly comfortable to navigate with the touch screen, but that's neither a solution nor very realistic when working in desktop mode, and especially in Office. Hopefully, new drivers will sort this out. But new drivers won't solve how stiff and loud physically depressing the trackpad is. Maybe it's an Asus thing: this was also the case with my Asus UL20A.\n\nBattery Life: Excellent. With screen at 80% & auto-adjustment on, I can regularly get 11+ hours in the workflow I describe above. Like others noted, a full recharge can take 4-5 hrs at times. It's usually taking me closer to 3. And, yes, if you don't already have a longer spare Micro USB cable, definitely add one to your cart.\n\nPerformance: Excellent. The user experience feels similar to a 1st-generation Ultrabook. Web rendering/browsing (I use both IE11 & Chrome) is noticeably faster the new Nexus 7 I tested recently as well as faster than on our iPad4, especially with more than 4-5 tabs open. And it's great to see 5ghz Wireless-N (and well-implemented), even if it's only 1-stream. The slow eMMC storage is the performance bottleneck now, and can be noticeable at times.\n\nOther: The speakers are surprisingly loud, if muddy. But still much better than on any tablet or notebook I've heard recently. And I'm unsure if this is the OS or the hardware, but the T100 provides much more headphone jack power than any of our iOS or Android devices.\n\nAnd it's always worth noting, if you don't have specific Windows/Office needs or a \"desktop\" requirement (e.g. you need to deal with files and folders in a traditional computing way), you might be better served by an iOS or Android 10\" tablet paired with an appropriate keyboard case/tray for occasional use."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I got this from other vendor because Amazon did not have the pre-order option at that time. I like this Asus T100ta tablet a lot. The internet access speed is much faster than my Samsung Galaxy tablet and not slower than my older Intel I3 laptop.\n\nNever wanted to touch those old Intel Atom tablets until the new Bay trail Atoms. I am pretty satisfied with ASUS T100's performance. The well-designed detachable keyboard really makes this tablet a laptop or this laptop a tablet. Since there is only one micro USB port on the tablet(keyboard has a standard USB 3 port though) you need a micro USB to female-end USB adapter for regular USB hookups for the stand alone tablet.\n\nThe battery lasted longer than one day with light use but it charged slowly. Maybe it was caused by the low amperage limitation of micro USB standard(5V at 1.8 amp max). However, I still highly praise ASUS's adaptation of the standard USB instead of the propriety connector. It makes charging easier especially when traveling.\n\n**** Warning: When running the MS Office for the first time you have to enter the activation code. The activation code is on an orange pamphlet marked \"Office\", mixed with other booklets. I am glad I did not throw away my never-read little pamphlets!!!\n\nPRO: Light and very responsive. Runs all programs out of my desktop. Standard micro USB charging.\n\nCon: Slow to charge(trade-off?). It is not so much a con but a trade-off between time and convenience!"}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "Very basically, for $399 this couldn't be beaten if it worked properly. It doesn't.\n\nMy requirements were fairly simple; light weight, touchscreen, good battery life, relatively fast and will play most video formats smoothly.  It did all that easily when it worked properly.  If it was stable I'd give this 5 stars.  Here's  what happened after owning this for a week.\n\nI received and the battery charge was 0%. It took 5-6 hours to charge completely. I ran through the set up then used Ninite to install all the software I usually use like Avast, Flash, Glary and video codecs. That all went OK.  The touchpad needed set up to my requirements and speed. Not perfect but I can get used to it. I left all the ASUS software intact. I was rushing and didn't want to delete anything critical by mistake.\n\nI had a look around the unit to get familiar with the buttons and ports. The volume rocker switch didn't work. It didn't rock. It did nothing. It was broken. Not a huge deal as there was another two or three options to set the volume and I didn't want to return it as there were no more in stock.  But things continued to go wrong....\n\nIt started crashing using apps and randomly rebooting. When rebooting it would repair itself two times. Very odd behavior.  A few days ago I had a look at the device manager and noticed it listed several conflicts or problems. I didn't have time to fix those so I put it in my bag for a few days. I finally got round to having a look this morning.\n\nBefore I was about to start I loaded the Tune In app for some back ground music. BIG mistake. It crashed and rebooted the system. Then it started boot looping, claiming it was fixing the system, fixing it, then back to claiming it was being fixed. I had to do a factory restore. The Win 8 factory restore is infuriating but that's OK..just something to deal with.\n\nSo I started the restore and it went in to a restore boot loop. I logged in to my account five times and five times it just hung, after crashing every time it rebooted.  I'm sure there is an F key sequence somewhere to get an alternative restore going but, really, I've had enough.  How do people with no computer experience deal with these items? No wonder Apple sells a lot of stuff.\n\nA lot of the problems I have listed have been repeated on various forums. My experience isn't unique.  I didn't get \"a lemon\".\n\nThis is a great system with a great processor but it is let down by very poor build quality and a terrible software configuration out of the box.  I would gladly pay $100-200 more for a system like this that would just work properly.  I was looking forward to using my current laptop as a home server and dumping my iPad and Android tablets but I'll have to wait a little longer I guess.\n\nThe new Atom quad core, by the way, seems like a great little processor.\n\nEDIT..Regarding the replies below, I should have made it clear that I will be returning this for a refund and not an exchange."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "As close to what I want in a tablet/laptop as I can currently see on the market.\n\nThe only two things that would make this tablet/laptop better is ~11in screen size and greater than 1080p screen resolution. Still enjoying it immensely, though!\n\nI've connected a mouse via the wireless bluetooth connection, so this circumvents the rather poor trackpad, IMO. A good workaround I would recommend for those looking to use desktop/mouse-based functionality.\n\nMy intention is to test how using an external hard drive for gaming works out. Utilizing the USB 3.0 port should allow this, so games that aren't too recent (mostly Steam games from before 2009) are what I'll fiddle around with. If this solution works, it'll eliminate the need for additional storage in the machine itself; this will leave my 32GB version with plenty of room for essentially only tablet specific apps.\n\nGetting back to the tablet itself: this largely addresses the small gripes I had with the Vivotab Smart. The sound is much improved from the one mono speaker to the dual stereo speakers. The inclusion of the Bay Trail Z3740 Atom in this T100 stomps the floor with the Clover Trail Z2760 Atom in the Vivotab Smart. Display is largely the same. The only thing that lacks by comparison is the case (which isn't a big deal for me); T100 is glossy compared to the quality feel of the Vivotab Smart. Overall, a great improvement!\n\nSo, depending on how the workarounds for the internal storage work out, this may be my tablet/laptop of choice for the next year to several years. (-:\n\nUpdate1: Using a WD My Passport Ultra 500GB USB 3.0 External Hard Drive, I tried Counter-Strike (original) and Torchlight 2; both worked successfully. Will try Diablo III soon after it downloads.\n\nUpdate2: Success, albeit with reduced visuals. Game is definitely in a playable state. :) I was also able to get Portal 2 to play well on the external HD; awesomeness. An excellent solution for PC gaming on the go as well as having a simple tablet when you need it. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!\n\nUpdate3: Encountered what I believe to be a Bluetooth battery drain bug. I was able to reproduce it reliably a few times now, so I think I can positively say how to get around it.\n\nThat is to say, if you want to reproduce it, you'll need a Bluetooth device (I got my Bluetooth mouse). Make sure it's connected to the tablet. Then, simply put the tablet into sleep mode (close the lid or tap the power button). After that you can wait for the Bluetooth device to time off or turn it off yourself.\n\nInstead of sipping power at less than 1% per hour like normal, it's more like 10-20% per hour in this state. I imagine this is caused by how Windows 8 engages sleep mode with peripherals attached. An easy workaround is for you to turn off your Bluetooth device before you place the tablet into sleep mode.\n\nRather annoying to deal with but doesn't affect my opinion of this device; still a fantastic product!"}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I wanted something easily portable to take around with me on campus (yes, I'm a student).  That said, I wanted the internet.  Most any tablet would fit that bill.  But I also wanted to be able to edit word documents, spreadsheets, and powerpoints when I wasn't by my full laptop.  So the having office included was a big deal for me.  I've gotten good battery life and otherwise, performance for my tasks is quick and usable.  That said, this is by no means a gaming device.\n\nThis is a device which is convenient because it is light, and has a keyboard attachment.  My only complaint is the lack of a battery in the keyboard, I would have even paid more if it had that.  But with that said, for basic productivity and web surfing in a place where you have wifi access, this is a great device."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "Pros:\n* Battery life seems to be as long as advertised.\n* More responsive than I expected.  Scrolling and dragging things around is smooth, making the touchscreen a pleasure to use.\n* Screen resolution is a good match for the size, so you don't have to apply any scaling to make things usable.\n* Light weight\n* Better than average speakers\n* Included keyboard dock fits well\n* I have verified that micro USB OTG adapters work, allowing you to use a USB device without attaching the keyboard dock.  No drivers required.  It just worked instantly.\n* I can output 1080p to my projector using a micro HDMI to HDMI adapter.\n* I have experienced no hardware or software glitches in the 5 days I've had it.\n\nCons:\n* MicroSD card reader is slow.  Benchmarks maxed out at about 23 MB/s read and write on a SanDisk Extreme 32GB card that tests much higher (80 MB/s) in other devices.  See the customer images I submitted for full benchmark results.\n* MicroSD card sticks out a bit, making it less than ideal for a permanent storage upgrade.\n* Battery drains at about 0.5% to 1% per hour while sleeping. For comparison, my 3rd generation iPad loses no more than 4% sleeping for 24 hours.\n* Nearly half the storage is unavailable.  About 35 GB free space when new.\n* Shipped with dead battery and took 4 to 5 hours to charge to 100%.\n* Included charge cord is short.\n* The touchpad on the keyboard dock is pretty bad.  Clicks are loud and responsiveness is poor.\n\nConclusion:\nIt is a great little piece of hardware at a fair price ($400).  There are some shortcomings, but nothing critical.  I would definitely recommend this tablet to others.  The bottom tier Surface Pro with a keyboard cover is over $1000 and there isn't much it would do for me that the Asus T100 can't do just as well."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "(Note: I bought my 64GB T100 over at Newegg, as they had some in stock mid-last week.)\n\n--Pros--\n-Excellent value for the money\n-Battery life is good for a workday\n-Usable x86 in a 10\" tablet!\n-Doesn't get hot, even under heavy use\n-IPS screen with good colors and viewing angles\n-Speakers can be very loud, if a bit tinny; impressive for its size\n-Reasonable weight, slightly lighter than a 4th generation iPad\n-Clicks into keyboard easily & securely, easy to remove as well\n-Charges via standard micro USB; any 10 watt (2 Amp 5 Volt) AC adapter will do so no expensive propriety charger required if you want a spare or two.\n\n--Cons--\n-Some serious software troubles at first, see the rest of the review\n-Screen and back of tablet are fingerprint magnets\n-Only 35GB usable storage after Windows, Recovery partition and Office\n-Touchpad on the keyboard is awful in almost every way\n-Questionable build quality on the keyboard dock\n-Very slow recharge time\n-Included micro USB cable is only 3 feet, I use a 6ft kindle cable instead\n\nSo I've had my T100 for about about two days now, and its been interesting.  Overall I really like this guy.  However, I did have some major software problems during day 1.  I'm going to cover them first before giving my impressions on actually using it.\n\n-------------------------------\nEverything was going swimmingly, I had activated Office and installed all my basic programs via Ninite and had a couple games downloading on Steam.  I went to close the lid and put it to sleep like normal.  When it came back up it started acting like the Win key was on turbo mode, continually switching back and forth from the desktop to the start screen.  I ended up having to Ctrl-Alt-Del and forces a reboot, but things got even worse after that.  It got stuck in a reboot cycle giving the same blue-screen error (can't remember what it was specifically).\n\nEventually I did a hard shut down by holding down the power button for 30 seconds, then tried booting it up again.  That's when it did something really weird.  You know the startup screen Windows 8 has when you start a new machine for the first time, where it goes \"Preparing your apps\" and \"Getting ready\" or some such while rotating the background color?  It started doing that.  I could get to the Ctrl-Alt-Del screen and try to reboot, but it would just sit on the Win 8 preparing screen.  Very very strange.\n\nLong story short, I looked up the manual (Protip: F9 in post to get to Windows recovery) and did a full system reset back to factory.  Its a day later so far and I haven't had any other software related issues, though I will be sure to update this review if anything else happens.\n\nIts also worth noting a few professional reviews I had read also mentioned having similar troubles when first getting a T100, but they eventually subsided.\n-------------------------------\n\nSo!  How is it otherwise?  The battery life was good enough to take me through an 8-hour shift with 25% remaining, and that was being on almost the whole time, web browsing with the screen at full brightness.  For the most part its pretty snappy, running Chrome and a few other programs at the same time without any delays.  Metro apps also run very swiftly, able to multi-task with no trouble.  I haven't tried any games on it, but it seems pretty capable of low-fi indie games and even some 3D rendering without too much trouble.  The keyboard is cramped, but its very usable with some practice (this coming from a 6\" tall gentleman with large hands).  The trackpad is awful with poor tracking and a terribly loud click, but I use a bluetooth mouse or the touchscreen anyway when using it in netbook mode, so not that big a deal for me.\n\nI would've liked to have a few more ports in the keyboard, like a second USB port or a full-size memory card slot.  One must make compromises at this price point I suppose.  I stuck a microSD card in, and while its not flush with the casing it does stay out of the way so I don't worry about accidentally popping it out.  Its also a little annoying that the finishes on the tablet and the keyboard do not match.  I would've much preferred having the matte plastic from the keyboard on the tablet as it is a smudge magnet.  Also, there's a slight amount of lag when you push the power button before it wakes up, sometimes as much as a second.  Just a minor annoyance, but worth noting.\n\nOverall, I take off one Star for the software issues.  Hopefully Asus can get their quality controls to take care of these problems going forward, because once its up and running this guy is a fantastic compromise between size and battery life while haven't a good display and fantastic performance for the price.\n\n---1 Week Later Update---\nNo more software problems to report since that first day.  I've been taking it to work with me daily and using it as a tablet in bed.  Battery life has remained strong and its able to get me through a full 8-hour shift at work.  While not a big deal for a tablet, not needing a power brick is extremely convenient for keeping an AC adapter handy for an x86 machine.  I'm  still really not keen about the glossy finish on the tablet, but oh well.  In netbook form it sits nicely on a flat surface, but it is a little top-heavy and may balance backwards a little in the lap; not enough to fall over or anything, but it seems to want to stay parallel to the ground to be balanced.  Overall I'm still giving it 4 stars because those day-one software issues were extremely annoying and would've prompted a less tech-savvy person to simply return it."}

I really wanted to like it, the concept is pretty neat, after all.\n\nRegarding the battery life of product in the standby state, I had an unpleasant experience.  I turned off the Bluetooth radio as I had no intention of using it, and soon found out that the standby battery life didn't like that.  If you turn off Bluetooth, the standby mode takes almost as much power as being on, in my experience.  I pulled it off the charger after being plugged in all night and went to work... and came home to a laptop/tablet that didn't want to turn on.  Plugged it back in and it came back to life, with a flat battery.  With Bluetooth enabled (regardless of you intentions of using it) the standby battery drain is merely disappointing rather than appalling.\n\nThe wireless frequently went south, requiring a reboot to recover.  No amount of asking it to reconnect would do.\n\nSometimes it just didn't wake up, and I had to hold the power button for 10-15 seconds a few times to get it to come back to life.  The broken wifi and failure to wake up were very disruptive to getting anything done at all on the tablet.  The reseller I purchased from, Adorama, wouldn't take it back, notwithstanding the issues, so I had a tablet/laptop that wasn't worth doing anything on, because of the well justified fear/expectation that it would freeze/require a reboot halfway through the task.\n\nCaveat Emptor."}

But since I don't need to read in the sunlight, play the mainstream games (candy crush), and im happy with 1366x768 resolution for movies, this tablet is perfect for me.\n\nOh, and technically while I cant candy crush, I could run an Android Emulator and candy crush in it.  Or play Knights of the Old Republic (PC), or any number of awesome, older PC games which totally smoke iPad gaming.  Pet Rescue vs. Planescape Torment?  Having full x86 windows is GAME CHANGER.\n\nOh and it comes with a licensed copy of office, which is worth almost as much as the whole laptop itself if you buy it retail!\n\nThis is currently the best bargain in tech.  I've had no trouble using it, the WiFI performance is ALOT better than my old Lenovo Yoga 13, the application launching and switching and performance is totally adequate, *BAY TRAIL CPU IS GREAT*, power consumption is great, I love that it lasts 4 days of use and I can charge it up with the same charger as my cellphone.."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "My review:\n\nWhat I wanted\n  I was looking for a larger tablet than my first generation Kindle.  I prefer the full website experience over the mobile sites and the Kindle's 7\" screen is just a little too small for that. I also wanted something that I could use in a pinch as a possible substitute for my older laptop. I considered other operating systems, but it is unclear whether Amazon Prime Instant Video runs under Android or Windows RT natively without going through hoops, so to be safe, I settled on Windows 8.1. I wanted a tablet first with an option to be an ultraportable second. I didn't want to spend $800+ on a more expensive/feature rich tablet, nor did I want a similarly priced tablet sans keyboard or MS Office and with the previous generation processor.\n\nWhat I expected\n  I was well aware that, at this price point, concessions would need to be made as compared to a more expensive unit (I would have liked a full 1080p display or more RAM). I read the reviews and was attracted to the newer, faster z3740 processor vs. the z2760 that most other Windows tablets use. I also expected a relatively speedy unit, on par with my larger, clunkier 4 1/2-year-old laptop, which was a beast in its day.\n\nSetup and use\n  As others have mentioned, the first thing I would suggest would be to let the battery charge for a bit prior to use. I was so eager to play with it that the setup wouldn't complete, as the battery would drain too quickly. After a few failed attempts, I set it aside and impatiently waited about 15 minutes for it to charge. By then, it charged to 13%, after which it would steadily charge even during use. Setup took a while, as I ran all the updates and synced to my Windows 8.1 desktop and SkyDrive.\n  I've been using it for the past three days and so far it runs perfectly. It is very quick. I have no qualms about the performance. I have not experienced any of the BSODs or problems others have mentioned. I've been installing apps and getting used to the modern interface and have been using those apps rather than the desktop when I can, just to familiarize myself with navigating the interface. For these apps, the touch screen is a lot more efficient than a keyboard and trackpad.\n\nPet peeves/problems\n  As others have mentioned, the keyboard is very light. It's not super cheap and I doubt most people would have a problem with it. It is on the small size, but that was expected. My one real complaint is that the trackpad is not as responsive as I would like. But it's not too detrimental, as my priority is for it to be a tablet first.\n  The second and more minor grip is that the screen seems to be bright or dim depending on which modern interface app I use. For example, if I have the Kindle app on the left and mail on the right, when the Kindle app is in focus, the screen is bright, but as soon as I tap the mail app, the screen dims. It was probably caused by some setting that I fiddled with; I'm sure that I'll stumble across it again eventually.\n\nConclusion\n  This is exactly what I expected and exactly what I wanted. I am very happy with the price and have no reservations about recommending this product, other than to suggest that you don't pay more than retail for it."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I was very excited to get this device, so when I opened it  and wasn't able to turn on it on, I wasn't too thrilled to see that the manual told me to charge it for 8 hours initially. I can't blame the tablet for that. Going against my better judgment, the little kid in me didn't want to wait for that, so I turned it on after only about a half-hour of charge. I will say that during initial Windows setup, it shut off due to a lack of charge.... My fault. The reason I'm including that is because it is a possible cause of how the device behaved initially.\n\n The device while plugged in, seemed to not be charging or doing so at a very poor pace, as others have mentioned. It was sluggish, webpages were loading very slowly in desktop mode and in the Modern IE app. The WiFi randomly cut out, and most of the modern apps (The Metro UI) would open for a second and then force close with no error message. I was aggravated and very close to returning it. However I had read many reviews that lead me to believe that this was not the case for some people.\n\n  I work in IT, and I'm not a person who can just give up on a device like this without troubleshooting first, regardless of how strong the urge may be. The first thing I tried was a very simple factory restore, not thinking it would do much but it was worth a shot as a starting point. To my surprise, it worked. The device was suddenly much more responsive, the apps were opening quickly and not force closing, the WiFi was working fine, and the battery was definitely charging whether the screen was on or off. Also to address another review, the charging LED by the power button DOES go from orange to white when it is fully charged. While it may not be the fastest charging device, it charged a lot faster than my 3rd Gen iPad.\n\nNow to actually discuss a few things about the physical device. The Screen is nice, not as bright or pixel dense as my iPad was but the extra functionality I receive with Windows 8 is well worth the trade-off. Besides, I didn't really notice a huge difference when watching Netflix or Hulu. The difference was only noticeable with text, but either way it is still a nice and perfectly adequate screen with nice viewing angles and pretty decent color.\n\nAs for build quality, I don't know what people are complaining about. I was expecting to pick this up and have it feel really cheap and light, and not a good kind of lightweight. This thing isn't too heavy but has a nice solid weight to it as well as the keyboard dock. I'm not saying it felt as \"premium\" as the iPad did, but it is perfectly fine to me and not just because of the price. The touchpad on the dock is a little erratic at times and doesn't feel great, but it works fine for me. The keyboard is a little small as well, but I'd still prefer it over always using the on-screen keyboard. I applaud Asus for including the dock at this price because to be honest using Desktop mode in Windows 8 sometimes requires a mouse or trackpad to avoid a lot of frustration from mis-taps.\n\nOverall, I'm glad I purchased this device. Anything intensive I can do on my desktop, though this little guy seems to be pretty capable. Obviously this won't replace your main computer unless you really only use it for web browsing, watching videos, and creating/editing documents (Comes with Office Home and Student for free..or at least bundled into the great price.) But it is great for what I do with a tablet and a little more. So if you order this and have issues with it, give it a chance and at least attempt a factory restore, which is very simple to do."}

The next day the WiFi stopped working and defied every attempt to make it work. So after re installing Windows a second time I've been using it for the past couple days with no issues. The battery life is better than any laptop I've ever used, and the storage is just enough for all the programs I need, with all music and photos on an external SD. I finally played through Portal and finished the game on high settings never going below 30 fps. The only complaint I have is the track pad, which is embarrassingly loud to use without tap to click. In it's price range of $400, there is no better 10 inch tablet. If only touchscreen laptops are considered, this is also one of the best deals available. The few touchscreen laptops that give comparable or better functionality for a lower price have less than half the battery life of the T100. At the moment, there is no better deal in consumer mobile computing."}

However, this device was a big disappointment and I'm convinced the device was defective.

The memory could not be written.\").  I saw maybe 3 or so different errors like this while doing different activities.\n\n* The wireless didn't work for about 10m after rebooting once.\n\n* Machine would sometimes hard crash after launching apps from the start screen.\n\n* Often had to reboot several times before the OS would load properly.\n\n* Clicked to add a new user to the machine, and the device went schizo and began to rapidly switch between the desktop and start screen.  Had to hold down the power button to turn it off.  At this point, I started to feel like this was a joke so I kind of just laughed and gave up.\n\nI got nothing productive done and was pretty frustrated by the time I gave up.  What's really unfortunate is that I know someone who was looking to sell their old macbook pro and take my recommendation on what to buy next.  Her favorite thing about the apple line of products was their reliability.  How can I possibly recommend a device like this after my initial experience?  The last windows based machine she bought crashed while she was taking notes during class.  Mine didn't even make it past the first hour.  People just want to get their device and have it work - no fiddling with settings or returning defective devices until you get one that is functional.\n\nAs a software developer who does most of their work on the windows platform, I'm really let down from the consumer perspective.

Owners manual says to charge for 8 hrs before use, did that prior to set up and only got to 49%. Set it up charged overnight only got to 89%. ASUS at least  says it take 4 hours to charge fully? Someone needs to adjust their charging times. Either way you need to watch your battery level,why? Because the charging light never goes off  like VIVO Smart Tab. I doesn't even change color so befor you leave the house you need to turn-on just to check the battery level. ASUS sonic master speakers seem to be absent (at least there is not branding or mention of it anywhere). There are two speakers unlike the VIVO Tab Smart but.... they are placed exactly where you would hold the tablet in landscape mode, your hands completely cover them. Brightness level..below the VIVO Tab Smart. Keyboard dock has usb3 but no extra battery so why a dock instead of a smart keyboard cover. This is ASUS 3rd attempt at a Win-8/Win-rt tablet and still can't get the combonation of features right. Ideally they should have taken the VIVO Tabb-RT which had a SUPER IPS screen with a brightness of 600 ( higher that any tablet to date ) This had total readability outdoors...it left ipad owners scrambling for umbrellas. I had awesome sonic master stereo sound and loud! Keyboard was slightly larger more in the ACER Aspire netbook range and had built in battery for 13hrs of total computing life.

I lost many hours of work due to this stupid key! And it happened again and again. Whoever designed the keyboard for such an otherwise good PC must be brain dead.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I bought this product because my last computer is on its way out. I'm a teacher, and there were a few must-haves on my list for whichever computer I ended up buying (Microsoft Office, portability, battery life, a real keyboard for lesson-planning and note-taking, and full Windows capability were the big ones). Because of those needs, I pretty much gave up on the idea of buying a tablet. Most tablets with those functions weren't anywhere near my price point, and then you had to buy a keyboard dock on top of that. When I found out about the T100, I decided to give it a shot because it tackled each of my main needs while keeping a relatively low cost.\n\nPros:\n-Compact, but provides just enough space (both with screen and keyboard size) to do real work\n-Full version of Microsoft Office and Windows\n-Touch screen works well, helping bypass the burdens of the track pad (see below)\n-Battery life is superb\n-One of each of the important ports (USB on keyboard dock and mini USB, mini SD card slot, and mini HDMI on tablet)\n-Windows 8.1, while requiring a learning curve, is a productive and stable platform\n-Front-facing camera is pretty good for online-chatting\n-Satisfyingly strong hold between tablet and keyboard dock when attached together\n-Screen is bright, crisp, and colorful, even thought I've noticed it's not as good as other top tablets\n-Speakers are much better than I expected\n\nCons:\n-Track pad not as responsive as I'd like it to be (many others have made this observation)\n-There is some give on the glossy side of the tablet, hinting that the build quality might not be the best\n-Slow charge time\n-Short power cord (3 feet or so) is a nuisance\n\nWhile the above cons are minor annoyances, not a single one of them would deter me from purchasing this product again. Furthermore, not a single one of the cons outweighs how great each of the pros is. Like I said, minor annoyances...\n\nMy original goal was to give this review without mentioning the iPad or the Nexus 7, but I've decided to go ahead and scrap that plan. This review is for the $399 Asus Transformer Book T100, after all, not the more expensive iPad or less expensive Nexus 7. While those products, which I own, have their niches and definitely help entertain better than the T100, there is one thing that neither of them does better than the T100: Productivity.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I think Asus found a good balance between price point and the hardware provided.  For $400 dollars, you are getting a decent windows desktop experience and a great tablet experience.\n\nBuild quality: I would say the build quality is fairly solid.  You will hear a little bit of flexing sound when squeezing the screen tightly, but nothing really out of the ordinary.  While the plastic for the tablet portion feels fairly solid, it definitely is a fingerprint magnet and looks to be a bit on the cheap side.  The plastic in the keyboard looks much better (and doesn't attract fingerprints), so it is a bit confusing why Asus didn't just use that for the tablet cover as well.  The hinge, on the other hand, is great.  The button to release the tablet is very simple to use and feels durable.  The hinge is also fairly stiff so the tablet stays in position fairly well...but that's if you don't jiggle the tablet too much.  While attached to the hinge, there is about 1/2 inch of back and forth movement that you can make with the tablet.  However, while using it on a table or even a train, I have barely noticed this.  It's only when I try to reposition the tablet that I realize the give exists.\n\nKeyboard: Definitely not a full sized keyboard and reminds me of the Logitech iPad keyboard.  I am currently using it right now and while I can type at decent speeds, I wouldn't want to do a long typing marathon on it.  My main pet peeve is the ledge behind the space bar.  it's a bit too close and sharp so pressing the space can be a bit uncomfortable at times (I tend to push the bottom portion of the space bar).  I am getting used to it though, but I do wish ASUS would fix this.  Otherwise, the keyboard layout makes a lot of sense and feels fairly intuitive.  I don't use the right shift button too much, but if you do, the right shift is half the size of the left shift.\n\nThe touchpad is ok.  It's highly customizable with the software that Asus provided for making gestures and they all seem to respond fairly well.  That said, I prefer click as little as possible on these types of touchpads and the tap to click function seems to be not as responsive as I would like.  Sometimes I end up clicking the touchpad in since the double tap wouldn't work. (Edit: Figured it out.  Asus by default has double click settings set to the fastest speed.  I lowered it way down and it feels much more responsive. That said, sometimes it still doesn't register a tap as a click.  Not sure why)\n\nScreen: While on paper the screen doesn't seem to get too bright, it seems good enough for most cases.  At the brightest setting, I was able to view it comfortably under direct sunlight behind a lightly tinted train window.  As for viewing angles, it is great and the IPS display definitely shines here.  As for the resolution, it's not that high, but I think it's perfect for this screen size while in desktop mode.  Any smaller and font size, etc all have to be altered which tends to make menus, etc not feel as natural.\n\nLayout on Tablet: It's interesting to note that the windows icon at the button of the tablet is NOT a home button.  The home button is instead in the upper left of the screen.  At first this seemed weird to me since I was so used to the windows button being the home button on the Surface RT.  However, after using this tablet, this design made perfect sense when using the tablet in portrait mode (On the Surface RT / Pro, I would tend to hit the home button by accident in portrait mode which was a bit annoying).  In the end, I found myself using the windows button in the charms bar most of the time.  As for the volume button, that's in the upper left and all other ports are on the right.  For people that are curious, the USB 3 can charge phones, etc.\n\nPerformance: After disabling Asus's software on startup, memory usage hovers around 45% on a fresh reboot.  I installed Office and some basic programs and I currently have about 30GB of usable space left (64GB model).  In terms of speed, the tablet is extremely responsive.  Bootup is fairly fast (Feels like 10 seconds, but could be longer) and apps are all fairly responsive.  Compared to the Surface RT, it is night and day and I do not feel that nagging want for more speed.  I've also used a Surface Pro before, and under basic usages, I would say the two feel about the same in responsiveness (a few apps open and nothing running under heavy load), though loading times feels slower than the Pro at times.  Under heavier load, the Pro definitely feels faster, probably due to the 2GB memory constraint on this machine (I did not do a side by side test.  Just based on feeling).  Flash also works great in IE in tablet mode since this is not the gimped version of Windows.\n\nSound: I think this was the biggest surprise for me.  Seeing as how sound is terrible in the RT (way too soft), I was blown away how loud this tablet gets relative to the RT.  Overall, compared to what I expected, this is easily above average.  Obviously this is still tablet speakers, but for what it is, I'm pleased.\n\nBattery Life: One of the stars is the battery life.  Under normal usage, I would get around 10 hours+ of usage.  And this is part of the time streaming Netflix over wifi with the volume turned up.  That said, I did have my screen brightness at around 30% when doing this.  However, by and large, this is definitely an all day machine.\n\nOverall, given the price point, I am very pleased with the overall feel and performance of this machine."}

I have a Nexus 7 tablet also manufactured by ASUS and it's got the brightness that which you can use outdoor without much problem but with this ASUS T100, it's DARK! Even if you raise the brightness all the way up it's still lag behind the Nexus 7 with only half way adjusted in brightness. I hate that! This is the same issues I had with Samsung products as well.  This tablet bad enough that it's built with glass screen so you already get the mirror effect but with the lack of brightness it's impossible to view it in the daylight! I hang out at outdoor coffee shops and write blogs and with this tablet, it's impossible! If you're asking about whether this tablet could be a defect, it's NOT. Try placing it next to iPad or Google Nexus 7 and you'll see a huge difference in lack of brightness with ASUS T100.  Another problem with this tablet is the font and image sizes, it's way too small when in desktop mode. I opened the Control Panel window and you can barely see the fonts and images.  The folders are so small that you can't use fingers to select it. And yes, you CAN'T expand the control panel window either so you're stuck with the smallness of the images and fonts.  I have a beat up old HP Mini Netbook I bought 3 years ago for $299 and it's the same screen size as this ASUS but you can see all the fonts and images as they are much bigger by default.  Ridiculous that these two problems are not mentioned in the reviews, both here and Youtube.  I will be returning this POS and will be shopping for a regular touchscreen notebook."}

It would kill two birds with one stone - upgrade my old Xoom tablet to something new, and consolidate my travel laptop and tablet into one machine.\n\nThe fact that it came with a full version of Office was just icing on the cake - I had all but decided to buy it before I even knew that.\n\nSo far, I'm liking it a lot, but with a few caveats. First, the good points:\n\n* This type of machine is really what Windows 8/8.1 was meant to be used on. I don't even think MS itself is really getting it right with Surface. It can't be overstated how important it is to have a keyboard dock with a real hinge, so you're not relying on a stupid kickstand to hold the screen up in your lap. A 1 lb. keyboard with a hinge makes it feel like using a real (very small and light but slightly top-heavy) laptop. And when you do want to switch over to the \"Modern\" UI for tablet use and/or media consumption, just press one button and undock the tablet - voila. This feels like the future.\n\n* It's a pretty snappy machine, unlike the Eee PC netbooks that it's the spiritual successor to (ASUS calls it a direct replacement). It doesn't have the RAM to be a real multitasking powerhouse, but in regular use it always feels quick and responsive, in either the desktop or modern UI.\n\n* It gets great battery life. I haven't done any formal tests but I can use it for what feels like a full day and still have juice left when I go to bed. ASUS says it's \"up to 11 hours\" and I've seen tests that show anywhere from 8-10 depending on use, but since you don't really use any machine non-stop without a break for that period of time, realistically most people should expect a full day.\n\n* Full Windows 8.1 and full Office - I mean until this machine (and others based on the new Bay Trail CPU's) was released, you just didn't see that at this price point on a convertible. It's a great value. You can run all your regular Windows desktop software on this machine.\n\nKeep in mind these good points are all *really* good things, so even though there are fewer of them, they still outweigh the bad points.\n\nNow the caveats and cons:\n\n* No sugarcoating it - it's cheaply built. My wife has a later model 10\" Eee PC, also from ASUS, and that thing is a tank compared to the T100 even though it actually sold for less. The T100 is made of thin, glossy, fingerprint attracting plastic that greases up and flexes easily, the keyboard keys feel hollow, and the touchpad isn't even flat. I thought mine was defective but you can even see this in some of the official photos (from the right angle). I think some are just worse than others; the top of my touchpad is actually above the bezel. ASUS is clearly putting their production costs into the included software with this machine (full Windows 8.1 + full Office 2013), not the hardware.\n\n* There are hardly any ports - just one USB and one mini-HDMI, plus a MicroSD card slot. You could argue that a lot of ports aren't necessary on a machine like this, but my wife's Eee PC has three USB ports, a full size SD card slot, an ethernet port, and even a VGA port. Keep in mind that the Eee PC is roughly the same size, but I'd even accept the dock on the T100 being slightly thicker. Ok, a VGA port is probably frivolous, but I'd love to have a full SD card slot (so I could more easily transfer photos) and another USB port. Relatedly, the MicroSD card hangs out of the slot when you have one inserted - like you're not meant to leave it there permanently to increase storage. My Xoom has a door that closes flush when you have a card inserted, so you can just use it as permanent storage without worrying about it.\n\n* No notification light, in fact no lights of any kind other than a charging light. I like to know when I have email without turning the machine on, and I also like to see drive read/write activity (important even with SSD's, just to know what's going on).\n\n* The touchpad lags if you haven't used it for 10 seconds, like it's gone into \"sleep\" mode. I'm still searching for a setting somewhere to fix this and I hope there is one - this is probably the single most annoying thing about using this machine. It only applies to laptop mode, obviously, and I've started just touching the screen more to get around it, but having a touchpad for things like desktop Photoshop is one of the main reasons I bought this machine over another Bay Trail tablet, so I really hope I can fix this in software.\n\n* Windows as a tablet OS is still pretty rough compared to either Android or iOS. For example, there's no central notification area. Xbox Music doesn't seem to let you store and stream your music from the cloud. There's no first-party bookstore. Kindle, which comes preinstalled to make up for that, doesn't sell magazines through its Windows app. There's stuff like that all over Windows 8.1 that is either missing completely, or implemented poorly compared to the competition. That's not even considering missing major third party apps like Pandora, HBO Go or PayPal.\n\nThis isn't ASUS' fault but it is something to think about if you're like me and considering this machine vs. just buying an iPad or Android tablet and a separate keyboard. What it comes down to is desktop software and whether that tips the balance for you (as it did for me). On tablet merits alone, I would certainly buy something else - there are much better built tablets out there running better tablet OS's with more app support for around the same price or even less.\n\nBut if you do need to run desktop Windows software and still want tablet functionality, there's probably no better value than this machine right now. Someday there will be - there are clearly things ASUS could improve here, and either they or somebody else will at some point while maintaining the low price point. But today, this is the best value you'll find."}

I do not know why I got this BSOD but full reset solved it, after that it was working very nicely. Until yesterday a line of pixels died for no reason. I am waiting to see how I can return and or replace....hopefully this goes smoothly and I get a working PC.\n\nUPDATE: One week after initiating the claim, I got the return label, so now It will be up to te seller to give me a full refund or a partial one. I do not really like this feeling. A line of defective pixels after three days of use should be an automatic refund no questions asked. When I get the full refund I going to get the same product and see if I am more lucky this time. Anyone else with same issues?"}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "I bought my T100 almost 5 years ago, and I have to say it has served me well. I mostly use it to surf the web or read kindle books from the couch or stream Netflix and it's great for that, or pop on the keyboard and it's sort of okay as a laptop if you don't use a laptop much (I have a desktop in my office so I usually use that). However, this model is 5 years old now and showing it's age. For one thing, it's freaking heavy (for a tablet). I would definitely look at alternatives before paying any more than $300 for this."}

The camera was pretty much a potato, but it wasn't a problem because who uses computers to take pictures/videos anymore...?\nThe keyboard is so comfortable to type on. I had gotten a mouse, but ended up just using the touch pad since it was so compact and reachable.\nI actually dropped it about 6 months ago which cracked the screen. I simply disabled the touch to make it only a laptop. This week I spilled liquid on it, and due to the crack it went straight inside and finally killed it. I'm writing this review as a kind of eulogy. It was there for me when I needed it. It had a long battery life, the charger is so amazing I bought an extra that I still use to charge my phone. RIP little guy. I'll never forget you."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00FFJ0HUE", "review": "Terrible laptop. Firmware is unreliable. A laptop running Win10 should ALWAYS be able to run the recommended updates from Microsoft to prevent security flaws.\n\nComputer is stuck in a loop trying to boot up. It will keep turning off against your will. I bought this to use for school. I thought it would be perfect for a student to have because it is small, runs Windows, has Office, and the screen is very vivid. I have not downloaded any demanding apps since I keep this laptop strictly for homework. Yet this laptop cannot do the simple tasks that I need to write an essay on Word or use a web-based homework tool that is graded by my professor.\n\nDo not get this laptop. I recommend that you spend an extra $200.00 on a GOOD laptop so that you do not lose your files like I did. Very disappointed in ASUS because I was really rooting for them against the giants like Dell and HP."}
