{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "I bought the Zenpad S because of the price and features. I was still using a Nexus 7 until the Zenpad S came along with all its value forcing the upgrade.\n\nHardware:\nI opted for the budget friendly 2gb/32gb model because I didn't think the additional RAM would benefit me and I just don't need 64gb storage. I don't take pictures with a tablet so the 5mp/8mp cameras of the Z580CA wasn't attractive either. I wasn't aware until after I purchased the Z580C that the Z580CA model's CPU is 2.3ghz compared the 2gb/32gb model's 1.3ghz. That additional processor power might've been enough to push me into that model had I not already received, setup, and enjoyed the Z580C so far.\n\nPerformance:\nThe Z580C is pretty peppy. Applications open and close quickly, webpages scroll smoothly and zippily, and after playing Asphalt for ten minutes I'm pretty satisfied. I also played some Words with Friends and Solitaire and that went super well too. I'm also pleased with wifi so far (in comparison to my Nexus 7).\n\nPros:\nThe obvious pros are the great price, 64bit quad core CPU, 32gb storage expandable to 128gb, 2gb memory, 2k screen, left & right front facing speakers, and light weight. It's 1.5 ounces lighter than my Nexus 7, a little taller and wider while significantly thinner. You can feel the 1.5 ounce difference. The 4:3 aspect ratio is awesome. I know it's nothing new in tablets, but it makes a world of difference browsing web pages in portrait. I love it.\n\nCons:\nThe main negatives I hear about the Zenpad S is the screen dimming on its own and the poor sound quality. It does dim automatically on some applications but going into the power management section and turning off power save functions and then manually setting the screen brightness has worked around this for me. Maybe Asus will fix this in a software update soon.\nRegarding the speaker quality. This is a 10.6oz., 6.9mm thick tablet-  how people expect booming bass and bright highs puzzles me. The speakers are fine and they point at your face. They are good.\nI've also heard people complain about the power button being stiff. Yah, it's a relatively stiff press but it's still effortless. And with the tactile soft click you know when you've done it right. It's a non-issue. Plus, I really like and prefer to double tap on the screen to wake up the tablet instead. Another cool feature.\n\nOS:\nComing from a Google device with the unmolested Android OS I was wondering how the \"Zen UI\" version of Lollipop Asus installed would be and the truth is, it's fine. It took a couple minutes to get used to. Within minutes I had a new launcher and everything setup how I want.\n\nAesthetics:\nOne thing I thought would bug me was the Pick-Up-Stix counter style \"brushed aluminum\" backing but, in hand, it just looks black. At specific angles you can see the cross hatch pattern but it feels nice and is fingerprint proof. This doesn't matter at all really but the back of this tablet looks really nice. The slim polished edge of the aluminum backing that separates the Pick-Up-Stix counter style brushed aluminum from the leather-look plastic is beautiful. The branding on the leather-look plastic is very subdued which I like. This tablet really looks great.\n\nOverall I have to say, as everyone will say, the Z580C is a very good value. Is the Z580CA a better value? I don't know I don't have one. If this one came with a longer power cord I'd give it 4.5 stars so I want to give it 4.49 stars but I can't. So I rounded.\n\n*****************************************************\n\n9/3/15 - After a couple weeks with this tablet the excitement has definitely settled down...a lot. There've been several ASUS updates, one to the ASUS's side of the OS I think (still L5.0), and many to all of the ASUS installed applications. The tablet is noticeably less zippy. It's not a sloth or anything, but it makes we wonder if I really should have waited a couple weeks for the Z580CA version instead with it's increased processor, memory, and gpu power.\n\nThe screen dimming thing seems to have subsided through the updates...I think. I realized today I haven't noticed it happening for a couple days other than going from a bright area to a dark area which is normal. The only thing that's a little weird still is the ASUS vivid picture maker brighterer doodad. I notice it very rarely, but sometimes when I open an application that's colorful, like Words with Friends, the colors are super hot and washed out looking for a few seconds then corrects itself.\n\nBattery life has been average. I charge it every day-day and a half. I use it for for a few hours a day to stream videos, plays mediocre games, check email, and surf the information super highway.\n\nI still think it's it's fantastic bargain and have no real major complaints about it.\n\n******************************************************\n\nI bought a case- it fits perfectly. I like it.\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Case-Logic-TS-108-Galaxy-Tablet/dp/B00CTHQ5JM/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1442344492&sr=8-2&keywords=ts-108\n\n*****************************************************\n\n10/5/15\nAfter almost two months I still enjoy this tablet. Some things of note after more use: I really like whatever coating is on the screen. My Nexus7 would be covered in fingerprints and swipe marks after several days but this screen stays relatively clean except for single fingerprint marks on frequently poked areas of the screen. This makes the screen very easily cleaned with a few wipes of a cloth.\n\nI've had it powered up for two weeks at a time without issue. Charging is not slow. My experience has been 2-3 hours to get to 95% from 15%. I did buy a cheapie 6' charging cable and it takes ~50% longer to charge. But I bought it mainly to use the tablet while charging so it doesn't really bother me. But a 6' cable is awesome! Do it!\n\nStill happy. \"No Ragrets\" here."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "I can only give this a 4 due to the fact that I'm not sure how Asus will go about updating the tablet. I got mine from newegg because Amazon didn't have it in stock on release day. And that still seems to be the case as I write this review . I am experiencing issues getting AC Wi-Fi on my device from my router when  my AC devices have no issues.  It's only receiving 5 gigahertz N Wi-Fi. The 4 gigs of ram is amazing because nothing closes in the background I'm able to do everything from stream to download movies and follow sports as it's happening online in such a small form factor. Besides the Wi-Fi issues I have no complaints so far. 64 gigs of internal memory is more than enough for a tablet plus having a micro SD card!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "Asus has been known to make extremely budget friendly Android tablets and Smartphones within the last couple of years so it is no surprise to see that the all new Zenpad S followed the same budget friendly model. With the their new release of the Zenfone 2 receiving numerous applause for it functionality and reliable service, I was eager to try out this tablet. Did it perform well under my testing? Let's find out. In this review I am reviewing the 4 gig ram variant.\n_____________\n\nDESIGN: The design of this tablet is amazing in my opinion. I love the brushed aluminum finish in the back which is a wonder to look at and feels great in the hand. It is extremely thin and can be easy moved around. The metallic edges on the side make the tablet look a lot more premium than it really is. This tablet is certainly a looker and you will not be disappointed by how many compliments you will probably get from it solely by its design.\n_____________\n\nDURABILITY: The tablet does not feel flimsy at all and the build makes it feel solid on the hand. If I were to Put a case on it, I would not be worried about getting is damaged if I made sure not to toss it around too much. The buttons on the sides however though not flimsy, are kind of hard to press which will be a bother to some people but fortunately there is a tap the screen to wake the tablet feature. The one gripe that I do have about this tablet is the protruding camera lens. It can be easily broken if the tablet is laid down in the wrong way so please take not of that.\n_____________\n\nSOUND: The DUAL front facing speakers here give great sound and is easily one of the better sounding tablets out there. They are stereo speakers and I gotta say that these speakers really helped me immerse myself into the media that I was consuming. A+ speakers on this one.\n_____________\n\nDISPLAY: The display is vibrant and great to look at. Colors just pop and if you want to tweak the screen, you can because Asus provides an app for that. The viewing angles are good and sunlight readability is good but could be a little better. But then again this is a budget device so I exceeds its expectations already.\n______________\n\nSPEED: The tablet is smooth like butter when navigating the software and browsing webpages. It produced no apparent hickups and performed flawlessly throughout my use with it. Gaming was a pleasure and the only time that the device would actually start having issues is when you are playing graphically intensive games for a long duration of time but then again the effects are minimal. The extra 4 gigs of ram makes multitasking a breeze.\n_______________\n\nCAMERA: The camera is great. Produces crisp looking pictures and great colors in your photos under normal light conditions. Low light pics do suffer but for a tablet camera, I am thoroughly impressed by its performance.\n______________\n\nCONCLUSION: Overall this is a GREAT budget friendly tablet and I highly recommend that you go out and give this tablet a try. It deserves more attention out there and certainly will deliver your tablet needs. I recommend it."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "I had been waiting for this tablet to be released since the day it was announced. I'm excited about it mainly because my great experience with Zenfone 2. I love the performance as well as the price of the phone, so now the tablet is equally lovely!\n\nI have played around with it after I received the package today, and these are some immediate thoughts and comments.\n\nHardware and Design:\n(1) I love how light it is!  It's perfect for traveling and commuting!\n(2) It's my first time using USB-C, and I like how I don't have to care whether I plug in the usb on the right side (which reminded my of the good ole apple lightning cable days)\n\nPerformance:\n(1) the price and the hardware are very attractive. It's probably the best 8-inch tablet out there. 4GB of RAM makes sure that there is no lags when using the tablet. The tablet runs very smoothly.\n(2) the screen is gorgeous and bright. Text is sharp clear. Picture and video display is great as well. The resolution is very satisfying for watching videos.\n(3) the sound quality of the dual speakers in the front is decent and loud.\n\nBattery life:\n(1) After I fully charged it, using it to stream video lasted about 5 hours. I would say it's not too bad. It could probably last longer for light use.\n\nSoftware:\n(1) I don't mind the Zen UI. It's smooth and easier to use. However, I do prefer using Nova Launcher instead (I use it on my Zenfone 2). With that said, I think the upcoming Z stylus is integrated with the Zen UI based on some Taiwanese reviews I have read, so when it came out, I might stay with Zen UI.\n(2) bloatware is always the problem with devices that do not come with pure android. Just as my past experience with Samsung devices, I personally don't like the bloatware, but it's not a deal breaker for me since I can de-bloat it with rooting.\n(3) With such good hardware configuration and 8-inch screen, it's slightly disappointing that ASUS didn't implement multiwindow feature.\n\nGaming:\n(1) I don't really play games, but for the sake of testing, I tried Lionheart. It's smooth. However, one annoying thing is that it automatically lower the brightness of the screen to ensure performance and the temperature of the device. The device remains warm throughout gaming, but not hot.\n\nCamera:\n(1) it's not bad, but the quality of photos will not be ideal if the lighting is not good, and there would be a lot of noise in the picture.\n\nOther:\n(1) I'm anxiously waiting for Z Stylus to come out (this is partly why I bought this tablet). As mentioned earlier, some tech reviewers in Taiwan have received one for testing. And the general review has been positive. I will update this part when it's release.\n\nBottom line:\nIf you are looking for a budget tablet and yet with decent performance, I would recommend this one. For the price and performance, I'm giving this tablet 5 stars."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "I only have 2 days of experience with this tablet, but so far I am very pleased.\n\nFor a little history, my last few devices have been a Nexus 4 and more recently a Zenfone 2 (phones), and this tablet is replacing a Nexus 7 2013 version.\n\nI've been pleased with the Zenfone 2 so I figured why not go for a bigger version of that for my next tablet, and that is pretty much what this Zenpad is.\n\nI like the 8\" size and the 4:3, I generally only use my tablet for browsing and games (Clash of Clans primarily), and occasional Netflix/Youtube.  The screen is beautiful, the battery has lasted longer than my Nexus 7 ever did (so far I'm getting 4 hours of screen on time (Clash of Clans), or closer to 6-8 with normal use (Clash of Clans is a battery drain on any device).\n\nThe tablet feels well made, I've not noticed any technical imperfections, and I'm pretty picky when it comes to looking over a new device while in the return period to make sure nothing bothers me.\n\nUnless something crazy happens this will be my tablet for the next 1-2 years, if you are looking for something in the $200 range, you really can't go wrong here.\n\nEDIT:  My tablet has now randomly turned off twice while using it in the past few days....I don't use it a lot, but it's not a good sign for me to be in the middle of something in a game or browsing and have the tablet just totally shut off.  Both times I've been required to restart the tablet and start over (it wasn't asleep, it was totally off).\n\nI'm likely going to return this unit to Amazon, unsure if I want to try the same tab again or maybe go with something that has been out a bit longer with more of a track record...."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "I have had this tablet for over 2 years now and it is still going strong. It still performs well. I did have an issue about a year ago where it was freezing and very slow. But after a factory reset, it has been working fine ever since. I'm typing this review on the tablet now.\n\nThe screen is still very good even by today's standards. It is bright and sharp.\n\nAll games I have tried on it work fine. I don't do heavy gaming, but I do use it for games when I'm traveling.\n\nThe tablet itself has held up very well. It still looks almost new. I do keep in in a folio style case most of the time. This is impressive seeing that I have 3 young kids who use and abuse it.\n\n Battery life has been good. Even after a couple years, the battery still holds up. I don't use it constantly throughout the day like I do my phone, but I can use it for movies and games on long flights with no issues.\n\nCamera is not good. At all. But I don't use cameras on tablets anyway. It wouldn't bother me if it didn't have a camera at all.\n\nThe only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that I don't believe it is a good value at this point. It hasn't really come down in price much at all since I bought mine over 2 years ago. That's crazy. It would be hard for me to justify buying this now when you can get the Kindle Fire HD8 for $50 when it's on sale. I also own 2 of those for the kids and they work well for basic games and movies and browsing. Yes this ASUS does look better and performs a little better and the screen is better, but not enough to justify the price difference. And the fire tablets have better battery life.\n\nI'm glad I bought this tablet 2 years ago and it was an incredible value back then, but it !at not be worth it in 2018."}

Oh, and beware of warehouse deals resale, the first one was really truly defective. Second one seems okay so far\nAfter a few weeks, the ASUS is far short of the old Samsung A2. The bloatware seems to delete comments in process if someone else posts while you type. Not sure if this is ASUS or the firmware, but it's a step back.\n\nUpdate: I may have to go back to using my several years old Samsung A2. The ASUS will delete the comment you are in the middle of composing if another person comments before you post, then you've lost all that typing. The old android tablet never did that.

No damage had been done to the ASUS.  I contacted Square Trade.  They \"fixed\" my ASUS and returned it to me.  Just a couple of months after the end of the warranty, the same problem appeared.  When I contacted ASUS, they told me two things:  1) that Square Trade had reported a \"new\" ASUS had been returned to me.  This was news to me, because although I had assumed a new ASUS would be given in exchange, Square Trade informed me they had given me a \"rehabed\" ASUS.  2)  ASUS informed me that the cost of fixing their bad product would essentially cost me more than a new tablet.  I bought a new tablet of a different brand name.  What a waste.  I've learned ASUS makes an inferior product and that is why they do not stand behind their product.  I have learned nev er to buy a warranty because they don't replace, they rehab.  Had I returned the product to Amazon after owning it only 2 months, they would have replaced the product.  I had done nothing to damage the product, it had just stopped working.  When our other ASUS stops working -- and given my experience that is likely to be any day now -- we will not repurchase an ASUS.  We are disgusted.  Mrs. B.R. Geddes"}

In the beginning, I had huge issues with text input for doing emails, and the auto-complete was not working properly.  It was really flaky, and often would not allow me to enter words as typed, and also refused to allow spaces between some words.  It was a nightmare, and I ended up having to turn off all automated text entry functions, which made it painful to do emails.  After struggling with it for some months, and after a few software updates, I finally went back into the (complicated) text entry menus, and carefully tried to selectively turn on some automated functions.  It now works fairly well on auto-complete, but still insists on a space after very word, refusing to automatically allow a comma right after a word.  I have to back-space every time I use a comma.  In any event, better than I started out with."}

This was never the case when I had it for 2 months after purchase, then ASUS pushed a system update and that's when the terrible short battery life occured. It has a terrible application/power management that even if you engage the power management every minute, it does not improve battery life. Also after the ASUS push, the boot time was noticeably annoyingly slower even if none of my installed apps were not in auto start on boot.

Incorrect or iterrmitent power outside of a strict set of bounds will trip the battery causing it to not charge. Draining the battery to 0 will also cause this.\n\nThe FIX\nWell this is actually really easy, just take a plastic spoon and pry off the back cover. Lift the connector connecting the battery to the motherboard with that same spoon. Wait a few seconds then power it on. Plug it back in quick to avoid the relapsing. It's a pain and you may run the risk of an overcharge if the sensor read is off.\n\nOverall\nIt's a great tablet, just can't justify this serious issue"}

I like the hardware, the display is wonderful, and the sound is really great from the front speakers. I can't say much for the UI though. Of course I am used to the pure Android UI of my Nexus 7, which is a high barrier to get over. Right now I am trying Nova Launcher to see if it is as good as everyone says.\nOne caveat. If you are going to purchase this tablet, make sure you know whether you are getting the Z580C version, or the Z580CA. When I was researching this tablet, I saw that it supposedly had a USB C interface, so I went out and bought $30 worth of cables, etc, since everything I have is Micro USB. Lo and behold, the Z580C version (which is the one I have) is Micro USB, and the Z580CA is USB C. I guess I will hold on to the stuff I got since USB C seems to be the future interconnect.\nI also bought a Samsung EVO 64gb micro SDXC card for the additional storage for books and videos. After a little fumbling around I got it lined up properly, and it slid right in. The screen immediately registered the presence of the card and the extra storage space.\nAll in all, I am glad I made this purchase. Once I figure out how to move all my data from the Nexus 7, I am going to see if I can upgrade the Nexus 7 to 7.0\nPS: I was really surprised at how much difference a single inch of display size makes in holding my tablet. Luckily, I bought a Procase Asus ZenPad Z580C case to go along with my new tablet. This is a really nice case, and helps a great deal in holding the ZenPad."}

Last night I was using the tablet to watch Netflix, and half of the screen started randomly strobing solid white. It continued even after a reset, across every app, and even on the home screen. I called their technical support this morning for help, and after confirming it's warranty status, and that it's software was up to date, their advice was to keep monitoring it to see if it stops. They then explicitly said that even though I am calling about it now, if they don't deem it worthy of a return before the warranty expires, I will be responsible for the cost of repairs if they decide I should send it in after that. The impression I left the conversation with, is that they don't want to be bothered with it, and that they want to wait the clock out so they can charge me in the future for what seems like a hardware issue now. At this point, I cannot recommend anyone buy this or any of their products if that is how they chose to treat their customers."}

Screen had to be replaced under warranty within 5 months, second screen still goes blank (to fix, you literally have to hit it like it was a 1970s Black and White TV).

The lag may have something to do with the UI, but whatever the case, I have owned 1GB RAM tablets by LG and Double Power and both seemed snappier in general. Also, because this is an Atom based tablet, it is virtually impossible to find a ROM that replaces ASUS' brutal UI.\n\nBattery takes forever to charge, but dies almost daily (even when in \"sleep mode\"), something I've never seen in other tablets.\n\nDon't buy this.

It would be okay if you could just uninstall it, but you can't. Not without rooting anyway, but I really rather not.\n\n- The Zenpad is slow. It just seems every task you throw at it is a massive task which it struggles to do. Switching between apps is slow. Even normal online browsing seems too big of a task for the Zenpad. Loading webpages and scrolling trough them is not fluid at all, causing big frustrations.\n\n- I would say the battery is ok if it weren't for the device completely shutting off when it drops below 30%. I think it might have something to do with the battery saver app, crashing the device and making it unable to power back on again. It also takes ages to fully charge the battery.

The screen constantly locks in the wrong position. It's currently stuck up-side down, even though \"screen lock\" is disabled. The volume and power button get stuck easily, and it's supposed to respond to a \"double tap\" on the screen to wake it from sleep mode, but it takes several attempts for it to respond.

I feel like those pros don't outweigh the cons though.\n\nI'm incredibly disappointed that Asus effectively only provided updates to this tablet for about a year. Since the Marshmallow update (which took forever to be released), there's been not even a hint at a Nougat, let alone Oreo updates. What makes it worse is that there isn't much in the way of third party support, so there aren't even any good ROMs you can load on it. For all the news about the death of the tablet market, I look at this as evidence as why. If I can't get at least a couple years of updates out of a device, what am I spending money on in the first place?\n\nThis device's performance is also severely hamstrung by the sheer amount of crap Asus puts on it. You'll want to dump ZenUI ASAP for some other launcher, as I found it both buggy in touch responsiveness and sluggish. I wish all these companies would stop thinking they can reimagine the launcher experience. Unfortunately, they also load in a number of useless apps that you can't get rid of (for instance, the \"speed booster\" to clean up RAM that would be totally unnecessary if there wasn't so much junk running to begin with).\n\nThis is my first and maybe last Asus tablet. I bought it to replace a recently dead 2013 Nexus. The irony is, that four year old tablet, running the same version of Marshmallow, performed nearly exactly as well. This tablet is a shining example of incredibly wasted potential. If it was mostly stock, without all the extra garbage, this thing would be amazing. If they supported it properly with updates in 2017, it's a five star purchase all day. As it stands, at best, it's a tablet I'll use until the first better option at the price point comes along."}

The main issue is the support I received from ASUS support. My Asus Zenpad connects at home or on most wireless networks fine, however if I try to connect this to a Sansung S8 phone Hotspot it will NEVER connect and get an IP address. I sent this back to ASUS and they received on 6/23 and after being on the phone with their support team for hours over the 3 months they held my pad hostage I got it back the exact same way I sent it, not working on a Samsung S8 hotspot. Their response: Test ok cannot duplicate. I can test this at home, I can connect my Iphone from work, my NVIDIA Shield (great pad but lousy battery life) or my laptop to my Samsung S8. All connect fine, however this Asus pad will not ever connect and never gets an IP address. (Note I have been a tech for 25+ years, with CCNA and CWNA background so I do know what I am talking about.) The least they could tell me was Oh this does not work with a Samsung device, or Sorry we cant afford to buy a Samsung S8 to try it with one. or anything but they basically said, since it works on your home router it works. WRONG!!! I would suggest never buying this product if you plan on using it on vacations etc where you need to use it on a hotspot. Issue is probably with something the Samsung is doing as my wifes and my friends Samsung S8 does the exact same thing with this tablet. Tablet is a 2 due to its inability to connect to a WiFi hotspot, ASUS support triple Zero, I will never ever buy another ASUS product again and suggest you dont. Hopefully If I can add to this later on, I am going to produce a video showing this tablet and it not being able to connect to my phone and every  other device I have does. I will send that and the tablet back to ASUS. There is much more detail of the work I did to get this to work, resetting my device to factory, resetting the network on the device, nothing works. ASUS Zenpad accepts the Password, saves, then tries to connect, says Authentication error and then saves again, never says authentication error again but just saves every time you try to connect. Weird thing is that it connects to any other WiFi device. You could say its the Samsung, but then how do the rest of my devices connect to it????"}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "The unit died inexplicably after some hours of use, but I probably share part of the blame for not fully charging it when it was fresh out of the box. I give Amazon lots of credit for promptly processing the return.\nThe replacement arrived promptly and I charged it as instructed. Annoyances manifested themselves in short order, namely a rather obtuse user interface that made it hard to find things I wanted - further complicated by the presence of a multitude of crapware and apps I would never ever use. It seems to be a hassle to push them out of the way and no simple method exists for stuffing them into a folder somewhere so as to remove the clutter they present. My simple needs involve listening to podcasts and reading the occasional .pdf, which the tablet provides, though the small screen had me wishing for another couple of inches. When listening with headphones, the trouble arises quickly. The slightest jostling of the unit will make the player wig out in unpredictable ways, such as rewinding, fast-forwarding, or skipping erratically to the next podcast or whatever. This could have been a factory defect, but I have seen this awful feature in other devices.\nLastly, when I cracked the screen, I went searching in vain for a replacement. Though a few were listed in the $55-$60 range, when one arrived - from mainland China, no less - the ribbon cable didn't fit. Finding a screen with the correct size cable connectors has been an exercise in futility. On that note, I came to the inevitable conclusion that Amazon sold me an obsolete or discontinued version of the ZenPad. But I also must thank my own stupidity for believing that this flimsy device, like so many of its ilk, is in any way repairable. But should a screen materialize, I'll give it a go, as it's already apart. If not, then it will join its many millions of defunct brethren in a toxic landfill somewhere in rural Asia."}

I am a very inpatient user when it comes to electronic devices. So the ram issue is more personal. If I had the bucks I would go for the higher-end model but the price and also the lack of micro-usb (but instead USB-C) on the higher-end model made me choose this one.\nOk enough about the not so important. I am a Asus fan, I own 2 Asus Zenfone models. So the Software is more than familiar to me. Everything works like on the Asus phones.

Getting no support for a tablet I bought brand new is pretty pathetic.  Asus tries very hard to confuse consumers with many different model numbers of the \"same\" product.  Beware when you are considering a Zenpad S3 10 or S 8 or whatever model you find.

Well, they know how to make money. I'll never allow an upgrade until I hear about the effects from consumers in the future. Really they should be liable for having destroyed a perfectly good tablet. Google/Asus, shame on you! I've had this tablet for about 4 months so far. This tablet does everything I need. I use it mostly for reading Kindle Books, but also audio listening while working out, email, internet browsing and simple work related projects. I took it instead of my Laptop on a recent business trip, to avoid lugging it around the globe. The unit worked fine. I like the larger screen. Okay 1\" bigger isn't a huge change but with aging eyes and a little more room to type on the on screen keyboard, it is easier. I also have an Asus 10\" tablet on a Windows platform, but find it a hair too large for me. Great screen quality and surprisingly good audio output through the internal speakers. You'll need something external for great sound though. The unit's processor is way faster than the Nexus, which was having problems multi-tasking, especially if internet browsing. The camera is also surprisingly good quality, not that I use for that purpose. My two biggest complaints are battery life and the auto brightness feature on this unit. Battery needs charging virtually every day and i only use it for a couple of hours a day. The old Nexus went for almost a week, so I think I got a used battery or a bad one. I expected better, not a down grade from the Nexus. But I can live with it. The Auto-Brightness feature has a very annoying flickering up and down especially as dusk approaches. I end up manually setting the brightness to avoid this problem. Again this was not a problem on the Nexus, so why the down grade in a newer unit? Come on Asus don't you test these things first? Isn't there a patch for this and why wasn't it included with a new unit? For nearly $200 should I be getting these flaws? A little customer service goes a long way and I wouldn't have to mention these flaws to the world. Overall it is a good practical unit.

They tried to \"improve\" on the stock Android user interface, but it's not better. For example:\n- There is a \"quick\" menu which you can use to launch common tasks. You can pick which icons show up on the \"quick\" menu, but you MUST choose at least 7 of them (there are only 9) even if you don't want 7.\n- You access the quick menu by swiping down, which is exactly the way you pull down the notifications bar. It's hard to get it to do the right one.\n- It's nice that it lists more than three suggestions for words you are typing, but it's not smart enough to add spaces between them where appropriate.\n- In settings, there are many long-press (context menu) options that don't work as they do in the stock Android settings app.\n- When you drop icons on top of each other, it forms an icon group. In standard Android, when you tap the group, you see a little pop-up menu with all the choices inside the group. On ASUS, the group replaces your entire screen.

It's wider than the old n7, that's of course because the screen is bigger, but I would have preferred to keep the same aspect ratio as now using the keyboard requires you to really fumble with the device to reach all the keys.\n\nThere are a couple of pros: the screen visual is lovely, the fit and finish is quite nice, and having dual front facing speakers is awesome (you don't need to make the ol cup the hand around the bottom to hear well maneuver).\n\nProbably the biggest downside to this is since it isn't running pure vanilla Android (like the n7), the bloat and slowdowns are obvious, even on a newer unit like this one.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "Great tablet for the money.  Plenty of onboard storage for apps, and RAM is adequate to run a few apps at a time.  Really, for the average user this tablet does a knockout job.  My 3 stars represents that the product works well, is of good value, and satisfied my needs.  I don't give out 4 or 5 stars just because a product works when there are other products out there that are better (i.e. Samsung Galaxy Tab S3, which I am typing this review from).\n\nOne BIG flaw in the design is the charging port.  I have had 2 charging ports break on me now.  No, I am not hard on them, but the power cable does not plug in very smooth, which my guess is resulting in damage with each attempt at charging.  The little black tab the holds the prongs on the inside of the port has broken off, twice (two different devices).  Neither covered under warranty, since I am the one who broke them.  Really ASUS?  I'm not going to knock on them too bad for this though.  As I said, the devices work great, get the job done for the average user."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "Our household has 3 of these devices (32gb/2gb versions) used primarily by children. We've had two of these for about 6 months and the third one for about 9 months, and the tablets have worked very well for the most part meeting all expectations for which they were purchased. Although they've since gone up in price since we purchased them, for us they fit into the \"goldie-locks\" zone for price vs. tech specifications, and maybe they still do. The tablets are powerful little machines that work great for light gaming, streaming videos (youtube, Netflix, Hulu, etc), homework help, and wifi messaging which is exactly what they were bought for.\n\nEach tablet itself is razor thin, lightweight, has a very stylish look with a sturdy metal back. It moves through applications quite smoothly and performs well under heavy loads. Videos are quite vivid and crisp, and the sound is great with the dual front facing speakers. The only negative about the visuals is that although they are very high in quality, we felt the need to turn the brightness setting to the near max to really make them pop. However, with nearly maxed brightness, that doesn't seem to be a huge battery killer at all like it would be with other devices, so that's a big plus. The camera is probably the weakest feature about the device as the images have a grainy look, but these tablets weren't purchased with any intention of needing a great camera.\n\nI can't give a proper review, however, without addressing the only reason I docked 1 star from the rating. One of the tablets, which is only used by our oldest child and who is also the most responsible in taking care of their tablet, had to be sent back to Asus under warranty for repair. It was under a low battery situation and the tablet was turned off, but when plugged up to charge, only a USB icon came on screen and the device would never boot back on. After calling Asus customer service who walked us through multiple button-holding combinations of various time lengths, they immediately set up an RMA for the device, and the representative even gave us friendly advice about good ways to package and safely ship it in for repair. About 2 weeks after sending it off, it arrived back in like new condition with a RMA resolution report noting which internal element was replaced with a new part in order to complete the repair. The only additional cost we incurred as part of the RMA was the cost of shipping it to the repair facility in Texas. (Some may or may not see that as a negative.)\n\nIn conclusion, despite the hardware failure of one of the devices, if we needed another one of these tablets at home, then this tablet would likely be purchased again. If we needed or wanted a more powerful device, then the next evolution of the Zenpad would be one of the first tablets we'd consider."}

Then after having it for only 14 months, it won't turn on at all now, \"bricked\", and won't do a reset either. After calling Asus support, a manager approved it to be covered under warranty. Cool! So, I paid to ship this zenpad for repairs, since they are covering it. Then they sent me a bill for $150! I called again to see why and explain everything,  and Asus rudely informed me that they won't be covering it because it was out of warranty that I can pay the bill for a new motherboard or they will return the worthless tablet back to me and they will not refund my money for shipping it to them either!\nI will never buy another Asus product or anything Asus provides parts for! Do your research, the zenpad and zenphone have an uncanny ability to brick shortly after the warranty expires!

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "So I've been using this tablet for about two weeks and here are my thoughts:\n\nPros:\n1. The screen is beautiful for the price. The colors really pop and I think the aspect ratio is great for balancing reading (in vertical) and videos (in horizontal). Which is great because I mostly use it to watch videos online.\n2. The front facing speakers are a good feature. Finally, I don't have to turn the volume up to max on every video to hear what's going on. The sound quality is average but being able to play at lower volumes saves power and reduces distortion. It still sounds better with a decent set of headphones but for general video watching I think the speakers are decent.\n3. Set up is pretty easy if you already have a Google account and use android on another device. The tablet updated to android marshmallow 6.0.1 shortly after set up (device has to go through some lollipop updates before it detects the marshmallow update so give it some time) which is nice.\n4. Expandable memory through the microSD card slot is nice if you have a digital movie or TV collection you want to watch on the tablet.\n5. The external build of the tablet feels nice and the tablet itself has a decent weight (not too heavy but still solid feeling).\n\nCons:\n1. There is some lag when switching between apps and opening certain menus that can be irritating. This will happen even when there is only two or three apps open so I don't really think its a memory problem, probably more to do with the ZenUI (more on that later). For example, if I have youtube open and I pull down the notification bar there is a 1 second delay before the tray drops and sometimes there's another .5 seconds or so before I can see the notifications. This is even more noticeable in the lock screen which sometimes takes about 2 to 3 seconds to transition from screen to screen. So yeah, sometimes the device lags a little. Not very satisfying but not to the point where you can't use it.\n2. That silver ASUS logo you see on the bottom of the tablet. ASUS, I get that you want to show off your branding but that embossed silvery logo is very annoying when trying to watch a video in a room with any light source whatsoever. You know how they sell anti-reflective covers for your screen? It's because screen glare is annoying and distracts your eyes from the content. Guess what happens when you put a shiny logo on the bottom of the screen? You guessed it, it distracts your eyes. Put the logo on the back or use a design that's not so silvery and annoying...\n3. The camera is not good. But why would you use a tablet to take pictures anyway.... I don't use the camera so I don't really have any input to offer except that the one time I opened the camera app the image was kind of grainy and fuzzy.\n4. ZenUI. The Splendid screen feature is nice for vivid mode and bluelight filter but everything else is kind of bad. They add all these search and sort bars that can be easily opened by mistake (say when I'm trying to pull down the notifications bar or trying to hit home) and they're all pretty redundant. They try to copy the navigation feel of an iPad but it just makes it more cluttered in my opinion. Also, every single time you plug in a headphone into the 3.5 mm jack, this sound optimization screen prompt pops up and it gets very annoying (since it doesn't pause the background so your video keeps playing while the stupid pop up screen is blocking your view for 5 seconds or until you tap the screen again). There's just a bunch of stuff that is unnecessary and just takes up extra space (why do I need a contacts app, its a tablet not my phone....)\n5. The battery is meh (for you older generations, that means average). It holds a charge pretty well on standby but any graphics intensive games will quickly drain the battery and generate a little heat. For video watching (which is what I use it for) the tablet battery will last about 6 hours on high settings. Charging is not that fast with around 1% every minute so anticipate around 1.5 hours to get to full from around 35%.\n\nOverall:\nThis tablet is good value for the price but could be better. If you just need a nice platform to watch videos and browse the internet, this is an okay choice. If you're the kind of person who takes your tablet everywhere, then this may not be for you. But in the current technological environment, tablets really only serve as a portable video screen for home use since you would be better off using a smartphone when out of the house and a laptop for any remotely demanding computing on the go. This tablet has its flaws but it is acceptable for its intended purpose: to check your emails (and social media if thats your thing), read some ebooks, and binge netflix/youtube videos. Just don't expect it to blow anything out of the water performance wise because you get what you pay for. I'd give it a 3.5 out of 5 but since Amazon doesn't allow half stars I'll drop it to a 3 (because ASUS bumped the price up to 199 from 179 which I think is just borderline worth it). If you do decide to purchase this tablet, be sure to fully charge the tablet before it's first use and try not to let the battery drop below 15% (when the battery turns red) because that will damage the battery life."}

I rarely use it to watch videos, but when I needed to use it at work to watch Big Brother and Survivor when the TV there broke, the sound was better than anticipated and the video capabilities are top-notch.\n\nIf you're looking for a good tablet that isn't an iPad, I definitely recommend this one if you only need or want one for the same reasons as me.

The front-facing speakers are one of my favorite features, and they sound pretty good for tablet speakers. Today, I got to handle an iPad Mini, and I would say the build quality is comparable.\n\nI haven't done anything to it yet that makes it slow down even a little (though I haven't done any serious gaming on it). It does come with quite a bit of bloatware, but some of it is actually pretty good. I'm using a few of the preloaded apps. I'm a big fan of the ZenUI interface, also.

It came with Android 6.0 or updated to it the first night I had it.\nUpdate 4/19/17 - Using Bluetooth crashed this tablet yesterday. I was trying to pair it with a Bose Soundlink speaker, and the Bluetooth wouldn't turn on. When I turned the speaker off, the tablet rebooted, but it could not find any Bluetooth devices even after the reboot was complete. I ultimately ended up cycling power on the tablet. The Bose speaker has been pretty reliable, working with my Samsung phone, the previous Asus tablet, an iPod nano, and a Dell laptop running Linux Mint 17.3.\nUPDATED 8/18/2018: This thing has been a disappointment by comparison with the previous model that I owned. System freezes are common, even when only one app is running, and I get a spontaneous reboot every month or so. The battery life has deteriorated to the point that it doesn't make it through an entire day of heavy use. I have been thinking about getting a new tablet, and I was shocked to see that I only bought this unit 15 months ago. Also, on the Bluetooth front, when I paired a set of Sennheiser headphones with it, I had to disable the microphone in the headphones so the audio wouldn't sound choppy.

I wasn't yet ready to spend close to $200 for a tablet that I mostly use for gaming apps and occasional internet search.  However, I cannot be more pleased - size/thickness is perfect, screen is bright & vivid, and it's pretty easy to navigate.  That being said, only having used it nightly for about 2 weeks, it seems to be having trouble charging.  I started using it on a full charge and decided to charge it when it got down to about 50% battery.  I had it charging all day, and at night, it was only at 56%, so I thought, well, maybe I didn't have it charging all day, so at night, I plugged it in, and the next morning, it was still at only 56%.  When it's plugged in, the battery icon is green and shows it's charging, but it is charging very slowly.  I've done a hard reset and tried different adaptors and am now using the USB cable, but a little more than 3 hours later, it's only at 66%.  So I'm not sure if I should just be patient, contact Amazon customer service for advice or a return/refund, or contact Asus for help.  Any suggestions from anyone would be appreciated!  Thanks.\n\nEDIT:  I went out for about 6 hours and came back to the tablet still charging with only 72% battery.  Looks like I might have to do a return. :("}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "This is my first tablet, ever, so I cannot compare it to any others on the market past or present. I must say, though, I am rather impressed by it so far, especially for the price point (at least it isn't a piece of junk that causes endless frustrations, like I feared it would be - it is smooth, and fast, and clear, and responsive... and oodles and oodles of memory). Between having a smart phone and using a laptop, I never saw a need for what I considered an intermediary device between the two. But, there are apps that I like to use (mostly language learning ones, but not exclusively) that are exhausting on the eyes when used on my phone (especially since I'm using them for long periods of time at a stretch), and just become clumsy on the laptop. So, tablet it was. Since it would be for limited usage, I didn't want to spend an outrageous sum on it... but I did have specs I wanted to meet (mostly, but not limited to: size, memory, and not having a seriously out of date OS).\n\nI chose Asus over other brands of lower priced tablets due to their association with Google and Nexus (they *make* Nexus tablets). I wanted something that could integrate new Android OS releases/updates with ease and minimal delay, due to a hard lesson I learned with my current phone. And, for me, it was sort of like buying a Nexus, but at a price that I could afford and without having to buy a used model.\n\nI like that this came with Lollipop, instead of Kit Kat or Jellybean (or lower) as most lower priced tablets tend to. My expensive phone is forever stuck with Kit Kat, as it became \"obsolete\" less than a year after I bought it (brand new) and the company struggled with getting Lollipop out to all its phones the first year after Lollipop was released (2015 Motorola users know what I am talking about). Instead of continuing to try, they rendered several models obsolete despite not being very old (didn't even phase them out, just dropped them - even after promising over and over that Lollipop was coming to those models). So, I didn't want to run into that right out of the box with a tablet. My OS actually has updated to Marshmallow (6.0.1) since I received the tablet, so I think I'll be good for a while. (yes, I can see that in some places on the page here it says \"Marshmallow\" as the OS, and others \"Lollipop\". Mine came with Lollipop and upgraded immediately upon setting it up.) I know Nougat is out, and \"O\" is on its way, but being able to have Marshmallow on a lower priced model seemed almost like asking too much - and yet, here it is!\n\nThe dimensions of the screen work well for me. The trend of long and narrow screens doesn't sit well with me (no real reason, just aesthetic), so this squatter screen suits me well. If you watch a video or view something intended for long/narrow screens, it will just letterbox it, so the video/image fits. Meanwhile, web pages and app screens are nice and big. Those of us with ageing eyes can appreciate that. I also did not want something that would be too large and awkward to carry around, or hold in one hand (I have small hands, even for a female) while typing or reading, so 9 and 10 inch screens were out, and looking at my daughter's 7 inch screen tablet, I knew that would be too small and just a waste of a purchase for me (might as well use my phone, even though my phone is smaller yet).\n\nImages are clear and crisp. The blue light filter is great! When you set it up, it lets you compare what it looks like on and off. On that screen, you can clearly see the difference, but once it is on... you really can't tell. If you have any kind of sleep disorder where blue light makes things worse, this filter is a nice addition to have.\n\nThe sound is pretty good for only having tiny little speakers. Some things can be a little tinny, but they are tiny little speakers!! You can't expect them to be perfect. But, for what they are, they are actually quite good.\n\nI haven't used the camera for pictures, so I can't comment on that. But, it seems decent enough for Skype! (another reason to get the tablet, for me, was Skyping my kids)\n\nI have run into two *temporary* issues, and I am unsure what caused them, but they seemingly have resolved. First was the first night I had the tablet. I had fully charged it, updated everything, did some system adjustments. Basic set up stuff. When I had set it down for the night, it was still charged to about 85%. When I woke up in the morning, I couldn't wake the tablet up and I couldn't get it to turn on. It seemed dead. After a moment of thought, I decided to plug it in - just because, usually, it is the most obvious solution that works the best. Sure enough, it was the battery. I thought that this might be an issue, and I may end up returning it. But, it has never repeated the problem. All I can think of is that while tucking it away into a safe place, I jiggled the camera on by mistake and did not realize it, thus draining the battery by having the camera on all nigt. I have no other idea of how it happened. To be clear - other than that one time, it holds a charge in sleep mode very very well. Second issue was the microphone. I have no idea what occurred. I was preparing for a Skype call, and right prior to that, had used the mic feature and it was working... but then it wasn't once Skype started. And, it wasn't just in Skype, either. I opened the Google app to use it's voice AI... and it couldn't hear me. My mic was off. Somehow. We looked all over, and couldn't even find a mic in the settings to manually tinker with it. So, again, first rule of IT... dunno what's up? Reboot. After rebooting, the mic worked. Haven't had a replay of that issue - yet - so hopefully it is resolved. It would be nice to have a mic control in the Settings, however.\n\nA word of advice: Get a case of some kind. This tablet is really quite thin, and there is nowhere to grab it that isn't glass/screen on the one side of it... so fingerprints get everywhere... and don't easily wipe off with a soft cloth - and vigorously wiping it with a soft cloth tends to wake it up and open random things (if you breathe steam onto it first, that helps, however, and you can avoid the over enthusiastic wiping). Grabbing it by the slim sides only... you run into either the volume or power buttons, unless you grab it just right. Since I store mine in an upright position (so nothing ever gets put on top of it, and to avoid cats walking/sitting on it), it can be tricky to pick it back up.\n\nAll in all, I would say that I am really happy with this device. I was afraid it might be of lower quality (you get what you pay for, right?) due to the price point, and was prepared for that, actually... despite all the good reviews... but, overall, it really does seem like a higher end device at a lower end price! Techier minded people might be able to tell me what things could be \"better\" about the specs, but the functionality of the device is such that those details don't seem important."}

Why doesn't anybody build plain vanilla Android devices? They would sell tons and save on all dev cost of these silly skins.  Power and volume buttons reversed from the Nexus 6p, didn't think it would be a big deal but I keep pushing the wrong buttons.  Screen is great, speakers are acceptable for a tablet this size, battery life seems great, arrived 50% charged and I used it pretty hard the first evening for about 4 hours and it still had 10% when I plugged in to charge.

A few months ago my Zenpad began going offline.  By this I mean that, even though in wifi settings it showed as still connected to my house wifi, it wasn't.  All I had to do was toggle the wifi switch in settings off & then back on and it would work again. (Also, I was able to determine that the issue was Zenpad-related because both my smartphone & laptop continued to be connected to wifi simultaneously.)  This would happen when I was streaming or not.  I went online & discovered that other users were having the same issue but that no one had figured out how to fix it.  Finally, after this happened 3 times in 20 minutes, I decided, as my Zenpad was still under warranty, to send it in for repair. I was surprised at how quickly they returned it, although without any explanation of what the actual repair entailed.\n\nAfter I spent a couple of hours reloading all my apps, etc to personalize it, as they had wiped it clean, I was streaming something and with in 20 minutes, Viola!  The exact same problem occurred.  Clearly they either didn't, or possibly, couldn't fix the problem.  But if the repair tech had just taken the time to stream something, as I stated in my description, walked away and come back a bit later, they would have discovered that they had not fixed the problem.\n\nI am disgusted.  I don't see the point in sending it back, even though it's still under warranty.  I like it very much in every other way and am considering just living with this idiosyncrasy.  But I am seriously disappointed with their support services and will not purchase another product from them.\n\nIt is now March 30. Last night the tablet stopped charging, As the charger still charges my other devices, it is obviously the tablet that is the issue, & most likely the port that needs replacing. Even though the tablet is still under warranty, the port is not covered & will cost almost as much as I paid for the tablet. No!!!!!!NO,NO,NO!!!  I am done. I am going out today & purchasing another tablet. AND IT WILL NOT BE AN ASUS.\n\nUPDATE July 27, 2017: Last May I sent the ZenPad back to see if they could fix the issue. That was repair #2. They told me that they wouldn't even look at it unless I paid $75 to fix the port. I declined, had them return it and have been living with the disconnect issue ever since.  Today my Zenpad died completely. The warranty doesn't expire until September. Piece of crap didn't even survive a year. DON'T BUY ONE!!!!"}

I have a three year old Samsung tablet that still works fine, but is too slow for everyday use. I am planning an overseas trip next month and want to have something to record my jounal entries without having to take my Chromebook. This Asus Zenpad looked like a good purchase. I ordered it while visiting family and received it right on time.\n\nFirst impressions are important and I really do not like this tablet. I have NEVER had so much difficulty setting up a new device as with this tablet. In order to use this tablet, you must A) charge it for hours and hours (and do NOT overcharge it, according to the instructions!) then B) set up a Asus account - not optional, by the way, then C) register your product with Asus - also not optional - all before you can even use it. I stumbled on step B  - I had apparently had an Asus account before using the tablet. I did not recall my old password and had to request that it be reset. I did that three times and even then, Asus account setup was still being persnickity about accepting my new password.\nThen I had to register my product. I had to select my product type - a tablet - right? - enter my model name and enter my serial number. There was no matching model name for my tablet, however, and that of course is not optional. I had to call Asus support to get help and after about thirty minutes on the call, I was up and running. The serial number was indecipherable - it is 98% unreadable on the back of the tablet and the packaging is extremely difficult to read without a magnifying glass. The next to last two characters looked like 6s by thety were actually Ss.\nI was very close to returning this horrible little POC back to Amazon for a refund, since I couldn't get past the Asus registration process.\n\nThe tablet, now setup, is just ok. It has a nice display. It's sound is pretty wimpy. Nearly half the 32gb internal memory seems to be taken up with the operating system and installed software. It's battery - at least today - seems fairly robust. But the setup is the worst I have ever seen for what should be a simple device."}

I use it regularly with Google Drive to take notes for work, with iScore to score baseball and softball games and with the Kindle app for reading. I am now into my 4th baseball/softball season with this tablet, and use it while coaching a base.  This tablet has been fantastic.  The battery initially seemed to last forever, but this season I noticed that the battery drains a little faster.  I keep an external backup battery with me, but have not had to go to it yet. The lowest the battery has gotten is 40% after a 2.5 hour softball game with the screen and wifi constantly on, receiving input and tweeting batter by batter.  To say I'm satisfied is an understatement.  Screen resolution is great.  I also bought a \"hotcool\" case to keep from destroying it on the ballfield."}

After months of trying every update, every bit of internet advice, and every idea that my tech staff had, my tablet would NOT stop randomly halting.  I was not able to use it for more than an hour or so before I would get noting but a black screen.  Until I removed the cover.  I have not had a single issue / freeze-up / etc. since I took the Asus tablet out of the leather Moko case last month.  I have updated my 2-star review to the 5-star review that this tablet actually deserves.\n\nI bought this to replace my shattered Kindle Fire HDX 7\".  This was love at first use.  Fast, responsive, a beautiful display, and access to all Android apps.  Unfortunately, my love became a love-hate relationship.  This thing randomly locks up.  I will be using an app, browsing the web, or simply reading a book on the Kindle app, when the screen suddenly blanks.  Hitting the power button successfully brings up the log-in / password screen, but the screen blacks-out as soon as I enter my PIN.  The only solution is to hold the power button for 15 seconds, let it go, then hold for 7 more seconds to turn the tablet on.  That may cure things for a few days.  Or not.  I may have to repeat the hard-reset cycle several times before it lets me do anything beyond the PIN screen.  By profession, I manage a support group for a software company.  We support literally thousands of Android devices for our customers. A couple of my techs - guys who can fix ANY Android problem - have taken their whacks at trying to fix this tablet, and given up."}

Because it has a 2K display it has a substantial edge on other tablets in its price tier.  I was disappointed by the description in the product copy.  It was not clear about the wifi adapter.  I expect wireless N capability to include dual band.  Most tablets that came on the market when this one came out have wireless AC capability.  My lesson was to research the specs more carefully.  I actually had to go to product forums to find out the true wifi capability.  No detail on the manufacturer web site.  The official spec sheet was vague on the point.  I thought the wifi adapter was defective because it couldn't see the 5 gHz sources on my network.  Nope. It was working according to spec.\n\nBTW, effective file transfer rate was better than wireless G at router signal strengths in the mid -50 dBm range.

I do wish there were better instructions for set up, & a glossary for some of the terminology.  If it's built in I can't find it. I down loaded a manual on my laptop so I can reference it while getting used to how to use the tablet.  But even the manuals aren't very helpful. There aren't very clear explanations as to why you might want to set things a certain way  or turn things off or what happens if you do certain settings etc. There needs to be scenarios what happens when you do this.  But all electronics are like that not just this tablet.  They must think we all know everything there is to know about computers.  As for the tablet itself it is very very nice, the graphics are exceptional.  It's very light weight and that's what I wanted.

The screen is fantastic and it works well, so long as you stay in an Android environment you should not have any major issues but I do not know of many people who just stay in Android only when having to do work as it would require moving files from another device, usually windows but also Linux and Apple, that will require another app that uses an access point to reach connect to the other devices, the single USB port does not work well with the Windows platform, even with the so called updated driver.\nSo if your looking for a device to read or light web browsing the this will work great for you other wise find another vendor that will actually allow you to plug into the device and move files with out the hassles of using an other app that will provide with minimal abilities to creat a new folder to store those files on the SD card."}

It feel's well made in your hand.(giggity) I had originally read that it didn't have an SD card slot and was surprised to find that it did. I clearly had my lines crossed after researching many tablets. This one is was purchased for a 7 yr old and is rather powerful for the price. Like many his age, he loads it up with games. The processor is capable of handling all of the workload so far. The 32gb of memory is sufficient even without the SD card, for now at least. The display is beautiful and the stereo speakers are quite loud and sound great. It's nice that they face the user. The camera is pretty good for a tablet. I searched for quite a while before purchasing, understanding the difference between a good product and bad one. (I recently left a career with a major wireless carrier which I was employed for 10 years and this tech was my life.) For the money, this tablet was the best bang-for-buck I could find. Side note, I would never buy the overpriced bargain garbage that the carriers offer. WiFi only tablets are the way to go. If you need mobile web on-the-go, try using your smartphones hotspot connection. Many carrier plans offer it for free or for a few extra bucks a month without a long term ageement. It's never worth signing a contract on a tablet like this. You'll end up paying for it in the plan many times over."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "Very cost effective tablet, but it OVERHEATS easily!  You can't beat the price on this, but if you're getting this you may only want to use it for e-mail, general internet browsing, etc.  It's definitely not a gaming tablet!  I don't play many games but do have a few on my phone/tablets, and this thing overheated a lot while playing some games.  The screen would turn dark, and the only way to fix would be to hard reset it.  These problems are well documented (as I later learned) for this tablet.  I ended up selling it.  I had trouble doing that even, because in the spirit of full disclosure I wanted the buyer to know about the problems so they didn't feel like I was ripping them off."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "While this tablet is fine for its price point, I can't give it a good rating because of the company's inaccurate information that states this tablet works with styli and, specifically, with the Z stylus. WHY ARE TWO DIFFERENT MODELS GIVEN IDENTICAL NAMES? I was wavering between a Wacom tablet (digitizer) and tablet because I wanted something that would allow me to annotate documents and take notes via handwriting to reduce repetitive stress to my wrists from my work and also double as a study and tutor aid (Typing math/statistics is less than ideal). I waited a few weeks to open it until I ordered a screen protector and stylus only to discover that THIS DOES NOT WORK WITH A STYLUS. To add to the confusion, the tablet has an option in its Settings for the Z stylus despite being incompatible. I now have a tablet that's entirely useless for its intended purpose. If you just want something light and portable for basic things like the web, e-mail, and social media, this would probably be a great budget tablet. However, if you need something that allows you to write, draw, or edit documents with the precision of a stylus, don't waste your money. Had I not been duped by misleading information from both Asus and Amazonshame on you for not correcting false information provided in the Q&A sectionI would have paid the premium for an iPad or considered something from the Samsung lineup."}

My Nexus10 stopped working, and so as a stopgap, I bought this budget piece to hold me over until the Next Great Tablet appears - since android tablets seem to be either a dying or dead market right now. I hope that improves.\n\nThe screen is very nice, I'll give it that. However, that's about the only exceptional part of this tablet. It feels a little cheap and plasticky. It's light, if that's what you want - but for me, it has almost no heft at all and feels a touch fragile. It frequently suffers from lag and slowdown, and the pulldown menu often will not fully pull down, requiring me to push it back up and try again. And, sometimes, it will pull down an asus menu instead, and I've yet to figure out how stop that.\n\nIt constantly tells me Netflix drains the battery and I should close it. Not very helpful - I'm using Netflix to watch it.\n\nSo it does basic functions, albeit a touch slowly and with some annoyance, but at $160 I can't say it's not worth it - as long as it lasts me to my next tablet."}

I figure it's out of warranty by now though.\n\nFor those who bought earlier Android 5 versions, you can't get the Nougat 6 update OTA, you have to get it from Asus web site, copy the file to the internal memory and look for the notification an update is found.\n\nCurrently the upscale 4GB model is not available and Asus site doesn't even list the 2GB model any more, are new models coming out?\n\nI probably won't buy more.

It does have a beautiful screen, is fast and feels good in the hand - a good size.\nTwo things that really hurt are the weird battery life and a propensity for the screen to go black all of a sudden for no apparent reason. The battery sometimes lasts for days, sometimes drains quickly, shuts the tablet down and takes 4-6 hours to charge enough to power back on. No rhyme or reason for this behavior.\nThe screen will by itself go black for about a minute to a minute and a half every other time that I use the tablet. No pushing of buttons or tapping on the screen or edges or me standing on one foot and blowing my nose (being facetious here) will bring it back to life. It comes back on its own when it's good and ready.\nMy previous tablet is a Google Nexus - made by Asus , which is why I bought this one. One of the things I liked about the Nexus is the ability to get \"into\" the system (a little bit anyway) and have some control over the workings of it, such as being able to keep the screen on when tablet is connected to the charger. Not so with the ZenPad. Asus, like all other manufacturers has added their layer of crappola that makes that kind of control difficult, unless you root."}

Wal-Mart and Best Buy pointed me to the iPad but I did some more research and discovered the ZenPad S 8. Just great stuff for lots less money. Unless you're devoted to Apple's walled garden the ZenPad will give you the same specs and quality as a Mini 4 for a better price.

I used the older Kindle Fire mainly for watching Amazon Prime Videos, and it was starting to fail in many ways.  I verified with the questions/answers that Prime videos were usable on this device, and the answers was, yes.  Well as most find, Amazon doesn't support Android tablets directly with the Prime Video app, this Asus included.\n\nTo make this work, you must find, download, and install the amazon underground app, and then use that app to download/install the amazon prime video app. Note that the amazon underground app must be \"side loaded\" (allow install from non-approved source, security setting on Android), and the version of the APK must be \"just right\". I tried several times to load the latest APK version from Amazon, and each attempt would result in the Asus rebooting itself during the installation with no app installed. I found that I needed to get a previous underground APK version (8.6.1.200) and this loaded and worked fine. All is well with that older version, don't allow it to upgrade!\n\nBattery life seems good, but as stated above, I mainly use it for Amazon Prime Videos, no extensive game playing by me!  The pre-installed apps from Asus don't seem to bother me, out of the box it looks close enough to a stock Android that I probably won't change anything.

When i got it and tried to use the audio jack, it was hard to figure out how to adjust the volume because everytime i try to raise it the video i watch closes and the tablet itself closes. 2. The dual front speakers are great but there are some glitches. The sound gets distorted at times i don't know why. 3. It tries to adjust the videos graphics by itself so some of the videos gets distorted till its fixed. Like when i watch netflix it adjusts by itself. I don't know how to disable that feature. 4. The brightness settings and audio sometimes don't work when you adjust it. I had to restart my tablet atleast twice now after getting it less than a week ago.

I have the 64 GB version of the ASUS ZenPad:  Pluses: Thin, small size that I can put in my backpack and carry it everywhere with me, great price, zippy processor for a tablet, 64 GB is a lot of storage, excellent for graphic intense video games, surfing the web is a breeze, using the microphone to write memos/notes is a nice feature, decent sounding speakers, (although it's on the tinny side, as to be expected), expandable memory (just in case I need more space), Android has millions of apps/games and I can find what I need (unlike Windows), fast charging (I bought a small adapter so I can charge my Windows Lumina phone and Zenpad in one), it's never hesitated when I have multiple pages/apps open or games. It takes decent pictures and HD videos. Android interface is easy to use. The size makes it easy to type using the screen keypad. It has an excellent display--HD videos/pictures/games graphic look really good! I like the reversible plug feature that I don't have to mindful which way I plug in the USB cord to the tablet.\nDownside: The special USB Type C plug was a pain at first, if I forgot my USB C Type cord (purchased adapters to use with all my regular USB plugs for my other devices--this solved my issue), if you don't have the \"ultra battery Saving\" mode on, the battery life can be average, the microphone feature dose not work with all applications, and a lot of ASUS bloatware that I didn't like (got rid of some of them). Doesn't allow me to \"Select\" words and \"copy\" to clipboard like my Windows phone on web pages.\nOverall: Excellent tablet with lots of storage for a great price!  Looking for an 8\"inch tablet, put this on your shopping list!"}

At first it seemed like a loose connection with charging coming on and off. Soon it stopped charging completely and by now it is dead.\nSince it is still under warranty I contacted ASUS for service.  I was told to fill a form in order to get the RMA and send it for repairs.  Because I bought from Amazon the only option was to mail it (at my expense) to their repair center.\nNow came the unbelievable part.\nThe form required a serial number.  However, there was no visible serial number on the tablet.  I called ASUS and was told to look at the bottom.  She told me that I will need a magnifying glass to see it.  When I tried that I found that there was something written, in tiny gray letters in a textured dark gray plastic surface.  I doubt that it was readable when new, but by now it is not!\nThe 'support' person informed me that there is nothing she can do without the serial number.  Tough Luck.\nI managed to get a closeup photo of the writing where the S/N was supposed to be.  You judge."}

I can run some games and applications on it that hog up RAM and memory very smoothly.  If you want a nice tablet that isn't as expensive as an Ipad or as cheap as the $50 ones, this is a perfect balance of price and performance.  32gb is quite a lot, and I keep all of my music on a separate 32 gb microSD card.  I compared many tablets, even Samsung tablets, and to me, this is the best deal there is.  It has some nifty features and a great screen on it.  I highly recommend this tablet to those on the market for a nice tablet at a good price!"}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "I bought the Zenpad S8 as a replacement for my Nexus 7.  The reviews seemed to be good from those who had previously had a Nexus 7.  I should have bought another Nexus as there are still some available.  The Zenpad S8 is a fairly nice tablet however, there are two huge things that will cause me not to buy one again.  The first is that I have been unable to put multiple users on it.  After researching the problem I have come to the conclusion that it simply is not set up to do this.  This makes it pretty useless for my needs as my household has several who use it.  It is easy for them to have a setup for this but perhaps it is marketing in the hope that people will now buy multiple tablets. Well, not another Zenpad for me, that's for sure.\n\nThe second reason I don't like it is the camera totally sucks.  There is a lot of nice tech talk surround the camera and a lot of features.  The video is easier to use than the nexus but the good things end there.  I have taken many beautiful and colorful photos of sunsets and sunrises with the Nexus 7.  The Asus Zenpad washes out the color.  Another major problem is the large number of photos that come out blurry or not quite focused.  Low light is another problem.  The Nexus 7 always did a wonderful job in low light without any adjustments.  The Zenpad has a low light function that is pretty underwhelming and tends to give grainy results. Speaking of grainy,  most photos cannot be enlarged very much because of they become very grainy.  One of the main reasons I bought the Zenpad was for its camera.  I don't really like carrying around my large Cannon SLR but it looks like that is what I will be doing.\n\nIf you want a nice processor that is like a small notebook computer then this is a good buy.  If you want multi-users and a good camera then stay away from the Zenpad."}

It was very useful for looking for information over wi-fi, very useful as a translator, and very light/portable.  It packs a great punch for such a small device at such a low price.\n\nThe battery life could be better, and I had to play around with different chargers to get it to charge properly (initially not charging, but eventually charging with the included charger), but for the specs and price, it is hard to beat.  If you choose to go with this tablet, I definitely recommend getting a 128 GB (max for this tablet) micro SD chip.  It maximizes what you can store, and extends its longevity as a hand-me-down babysitter (via lots of passive viewing content) for when you graduate to the next tablet."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "I like this tablet a lot.  The screen is wonderful and the size is perfect.  But here are some problems - and it's mainly due to the manual upgrade to Android 6.0:\n\n1.  Battery Life:  It's just not good.  I have done any scientific tests per say but surfing the internet on this thing for 1 hours with 100% charge should go down to 60%.  There's also been times where the tablet was in sleep mode at 60% and I'd wake up in the morning with the battery completely drained.\n\n2.  Battery Charging:  TAKES FOREVER.  Not sure why they never built in the quick charge technology on this thing.  From 0% to 100% charge, we're talking at least if not over 2 hours.  Typically most Android devices will charge very fast and can get from 0% to at least 30% within 10-20 minutes.  Not this.  To get from 0% to 30%....we're probably talking 30 to 45 minutes.  Usually, if I find my batter at less than 25%, I just plug it in to charge and just forget about it the majority of the day.\n\n3.  When updating apps:  If you have several apps that are updating then don't even bother using the tablet.  It will freeze or close out the current app you're using.  I've never experienced this with any other android devices.\n\n4.  Bloatware:  TONS of it.  And you can't delete them.  You can only \"disable\" them.\n\n5.  Can't use all android apps:  This is something that is not the fault of the manufacturer but more on the Android/Google side.  You can't use all the apps you're used to on the phone.  While I would say you can download and use 95% of all the apps that's available for say...an Android phone, there are some apps that just will not allow it. For example Canary, Philips Hue, Logitech Remote app just to name a few.\n\nI think at the end of the day, this tablet is good for general use.  Like I said, the screen is wonderful but the erratic battery drain issues (sometimes it's fine, sometimes it isn't).  I do photography on the side so it's a nice device to use to view photos.  But the battery issues is a big downer here.  It was certainly better when using Android 5.0 but they need to release a patch (Asus) or something to fix the drain problem."}

I find this tablet to be very well designed, with nice materials and great performance for standard Android applications, but to be a bit laggy on 3D gaming.\n\nI had several criteria in my search, and this one seemed to do well:\n\n1. At least 2 Gb of RAM. I've found that tablets really need that much to work right. This one just barely meet the requirement.\n\n2. A decent processor. I've been using other types, and wasn't sure of the Atom processor (it is more commonly found on Windows 10 platforms). I found that it is quite snappy. I checked it out with a benchmark, and it looks good, except a bit choppy on 3D tests, although it did work. I'm attaching a screen shot of the testing results.\n\n3. At least 7 inches, but less than 10. I wanted something not too large, but still readable. The screen on this one is excellent; all the text and graphics are really clear and render quickly.\n\n4. 16Gb of storage - I hate running out. This one has 32 GB.\n\n5. Modern Android OS. This one has 6.0.1, so it is fine there.\n\n6. Last but certainly not least, it had to be reasonably priced. At 159 bucks, this one fit the bill. If you are into gaming, there is a version with 4 GB memory, but I didn't want to spend that much money.\n\nI got everything I wanted with this model. In addition, I love the materials and construction. It has a leather like outer area that makes it easier to grip, and it is exceptionally thin and light.\n\nThe only thing to note is that the battery is not the best. I expect no more that 5-6 hours per charge. In my case, that is fine - I use this for reading at home and on the go. But if you want all day coverage without needing to plug it in, this may not be the best one for you.\n\nSummary: Very nice packaging, reasonable price, and good all around performance - a winning combination. Highly recommended."}

I purchased a Samsung 64GB EVO MicroSDXC US-I card to go along with it.  If you read the reviews, David L has the right answer on getting this tablet to \"Adopt\" a memory card.  It seems to work great.  I have yet to have any stuttering or failures from Adopting the card, and have 82+ GB of \"internal\" memory.  I love the screen on this tablet.  There is a newer model, but the screen doesn't seem to be as \"clear\" (ppi) as this one.  It isn't a 16x9 display, and I like that.  It makes it easier to see web pages as well as docs.  Maybe I'm old-school.  It just seems to work better for me.  Opened the box, powered-on, asked me to update.  I did.  Shows as 6.0.1 with the latest ASUS firmware.  Speakers seem to be quite good (did the Metallica YouTube test and it rocked for the size).  Camera is not the greatest, but I didn't get it for that.  Hopefully it lasts for a while.  Very pleased.\n\nAdded 12-5-16:  Have used the tablet and the battery life is better than expected.  Let my twins play all their games on it (some are graphics intensive) and the tablet lasted about 5 hours of solid playing.  I do wish that it would charge faster....maybe a separate power plug that charges at twice the USB rate....just a suggestion.  Still no problems with the \"Adopted Storage\" and have loaded about 8 gig of games/apps.  I swear the screen gets better each time I look at it.  Quite pleased with the purchase.\n\nAdded 12-12-16:  How to make an Asus ZenPad 8 (Z580C-B1-BK) use adopted storage.  Thanks to DavidL for all of the legwork to bring this to you.  I used a Samsung EVO 64GB Micro SDXC (MB-MP64DA/AM) for this journey.\n\n=============\nAcquire tablet.\n\nGo to: Settings | About | Build Number and tap on \"Build Number\" 6 times (tap quickly and it will keep count for you).\n\nGo to: Settings | Developer Options and turn \"USB Debugging\" on.\n\nDownload ADB's Android Studio ([...]).\n\nRun \"ADB SHELL\" program from the command line/prompt (may be located in  C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Android\\android-sdk\\platform-tools).  Make sure you type \"adb shell\" (no quotes and put a space between each word) at the command prompt.\n\nCheck the tablet and answer all prompts about letting it connect (look on the tablet).\n\nEnter the following at the shell command line:  \"sm set-force-adoptable true\"  (no quotes, spaces and hyphens are required).\n\nEnter \"exit\" to quit the shell program and return back to the command prompt (no quotes).\n\nGo to device and you should have a draw down menu from the top of the screen.  Pull it down.\n\nSelect to set up memory card.\n\nSelect \"Use as internal storage.\"\n\nAllow tablet to format SD card (it may take a few minutes to complete).\n\nIf it tells you the memory is too slow, select OK to continue.\n\nOnce the format/procedure is complete, go ahead and reboot/restart the tablet.\n=============\n\nYou should now have the Internal 32 GB + whatever your SD card has for usable internal memory for apps and data.  The tablet now has a massive amount of storage of apps, games, pics... you name it.  Shame on manufacturers that don't have Micro SD slots.  For example, I installed a 64 GB SD card, now my tablet shows as 82 GB available (factor in the reserved memory and pre-installed programs).  Go ahead and download games to your heart's content.\n\nI have not had any problems with slow performance or any stuttering.\n\nThis is an identical purchase to another I made two weeks ago.  I \"tested\" the other one and was so pleased, I got the exact same one... again.  I had older 4.4 tablets and the kids kept filling them up with games.  Hopefully, this tablet will allow everyone to keep all the apps/games and not go through the \"delete-then-download\" cycle because the tablet's memory is always full.\n\nI am very pleased with this tablet.  When I first powered it up, it downloaded an update.  I did not check the version before the update, but it is now 6.0.1 Marshmallow with Security Updates through Sept 1, 2016.  The screen is nice.  I do wish the tablet could charge faster.  It only has USB input, but I'd pay another $10 to have a higher amperage adapter just to charge.  It seems to get along with all the USB chargers I have.  Of course, the higher output chargers will charge it faster, but I doubt it will charge any quicker with anything higher than 2A.\n\nMy \"official\" testing shows that it will play 5 hours of solid kids games on a full a charge.  Again, I wish it would fully charge in 2-3 hours.  I don't really ever let it sit and charge without messing with it, so it takes about 5 hours to fully charge the way I use it.\n\nThe Asus IU Launcher doesn't seem to get in my way.  Sorry, but I'm not a big fan of Samsung-ized Android Interfaces.  I grew up on the basics and that's what I want.  There are plenty of apps and options to \"pretty\" up the interface.  The whole Asus UI is a pig, but that's why I installed the memory card.\n\nThe device seems \"snappy\" for touch commands.  I have yet to really notice any lag or \"variable response time\" while using the tablet.  Everything just seems to work.\n\nI like the 4x3 ratio screen.  It makes it easier to see more than just movies.  Docs, sheets, pics, web pages... everything just has more real estate.  Of course, there is wasted space/smaller screen when using it for movies.  I like that I have a choice to be tall and wide at the same time...just rotate and see what you want.  The screen is sharp/clear and the color saturation is excellent for the price... did I mention the screen is really nice.\n\nFor protection, I purchased the Cooper Trooper \"Asus ZenPad 8.0, S 8.0 case, COOPER TROOPER 2K Shoulder Strap Rugged Heavy Duty Tough Protective Drop Shock Proof Rubber Silicon Carry Kids Toy Work Holder Cover Bag, Stand\" and like it.\n\nI am very pleased with this purchase.  I think that Asus did a good job for the price point.  I'm not sure it will ever see Andriod 7, as Intel seems to be pulling a Microsoft on support for portables....  I'm sure this is seriously root-able and have seen lots of message boards for hot-rodding it.  It is a great tablet out of the box and has lots of web support to help customize.  You won't be disappointed either way.\n\nCheers.\n\nAdded 4/12/2018---  The tablets are still going strong even with 8 yr olds playing and charging them.  The battery life doesn't seem to be any less than when first purchased... still about 5 hours of use and 5 hours to charge.  I have noticed that the tablet is kinda picky with the charger.  The best one that charges the fastest is an Amazon Basics Dual 2.1A.  I like the memory adoption trick from above as the tablet \"sees\" it all as internal memory (older apps sometimes can't run from non-internal memory).  The bumper/protectors listed above have held up great and saved the tablet a few times.  The screen is still amazing.  This tablet has endured some bad drops and no problems.  Unfortunately, no updates since whatsoever.  Asus appears to have abandoned this...the saga of Android and older devices.  Still...the best value.  Very pleased."}

Typical person that the doesn't believe in Five Star the  perfect 10 or anything that says flawless, but I'm at a loss to what I could use to bring my rating down a star or even half a star.  Even though it isn't ASUS fault I was going to rate the ZenPad at 4 1/2 due to the dismal lack of cases, but then I discovered that the measurements are almost identical to a mini iPad 4 and with a bit of modification it currently sits nicely in an Otterbox.  Even what some are calling blotware, which I'm assuming is reference to the ASUS apps, have good merit.  Granted there are a lot of them but the ability to do an Uninstaller at the app tile really isn't enough to complain about.  2 Samsung android tablets, 2 apple tablets, a Dell Venue, a Samsung Slate and one of the two Surface pros have all but sat idle as this impressive pocket rocket of a tablet has consumed my entire attention for almost a month now.  Today was the first time it actually sat on the charger untouched.  My attention got diverted by a new Amazon arrival that required set up.......ASUS ZenPad 3s 10, the Z580CA 9.7 big brother!

There don't seem to be many that are comparable in all three criteria. The screen is super crisp, bright and beautiful. Streaming video plays flawlessly. I also installed the Kindle app and it works quite well as a reader.\n\n2GB of RAM seems adequate and 32GB storage is plenty along with the micro SD slot. I had a 32GB card laying around, which was recognized by the system. A quick format and it was integrated with no fuss. They're cheap nowadays so I can always stick a 128GB in there if space gets tight.\n\nIt arrived with Marshmallow 6.0.1 installed and a fairly current security patch was available not long after starting it up. I'm less fond of all the ASUS bloatware though.\n\nAll in all, it's a great tablet for the price. I'm very happy."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "I got this for one main reason.  The screen.  It is hard to find high ppi screens anymore.  I have a Kindle Fire HDX 7, which is a hi-res screen, but they have made them all low res now (except for the 6 inch kindle).  This tablet is mainly used for consumption.  That means Netflix, Amazon Video, and reading on the Kindle app (which makes the screen really important).  This is a good value for the price, but it has a few issues.  Battery life could be better, and there are a ton of useless apps preloaded on the device.  Holding the device in landscape mode can degrade the wifi signal as well.\n\nBUT,  it is only $159.  There is no other tablet that is that price that looks this good, and that is the primary reason I purchased it.  It is not as polished or as fast as an iPad Mini, but I don't need it to be, and it is much less than an iPad, so if you keep that in mind going in, you won't be disappointed."}

The replacement approval was immediate and the new tablet was at my door within 48 hours, and that was over Thanksgiving.\nAsus customer support, on the other hand, is quite a bit less impressive. I dug out a number for customer support, on the ASUS web site, and spoke with a technician who was unfamiliar with the device. (I made a mistake during the set up process and needed help to correct the error.) While the tech was working through his learning curve he must have decided it wasn't worth his time and disconnected. I fixed the problem by starting over with a factory reset.\nI trust the replacement will last longer than the first and assuming that my initial use is, again, positive. Battery life is very good, screen clarity is excellent and it's lightening fast. It's lightweight and very thin. My main purpose for a tablet is reading the news,streaming video and internet searches. So far it's excellent for those purposes."}

I also bought the Z Pen as well and it is an accessory worth getting.  The only downside (con) is that since Intel officially left the mobile processing market, Asus won't be upgrading the Android software any further on this device.  In all honesty this is a very miniscule con as the average user won't know any difference since Asus has added their own features and the only reason I notice is simply because I have a Nexus 6 with Android 7.0 (Nougat).\n\nThis review isn't very in depth as there really isn't anything bad to say, but feel free to ask any specific questions you may have and I can try to answer."}

So, no cheap devices with sub-HD panels and insufficient RAM and storage. The Asus Z580CA brings 64 GB of storage with SD extension and a nice 4 GB of RAM. That should be plenty for the normal user who primarily surfed the internet and wants to watch YouTube videos with occasional gaming. So far, I have been pleased. The system acts pretty smooth and quick without noticable lags. Sure, there is more potent tablets out there, but that comes at a price. This tablet is a very good piece of hardware for a reasonable price. The 8\" display at a 4:3 aspect ratio is a highlight I enjoy a lot. I get frustrated with low resolution displays, that's why I want to emphasize it a bit. Love it."}

Guess what - after a few months of speedy goodness, it happened AGAIN.

It's serviceable, but for comparison: my iPhone 6S is about twice as powerful in raw CPU performance (ref. Geekbench 4). The screen is great but a bit too sharp for my tastes. I wish you could turn off the stupid Asus Vivid software that over-sharpens everything. You also get plenty of RAM, an SD card slot, and it doesn't even flinch while performing most tasks. Games are a bit of hit or miss since the GPU isn't very good, but it will run most things playably. One major downside is the battery takes forever to charge. The charging port doesn't draw enough amperage to break even while playing games, either. Some light games are OK but anything that uses close to 100% of the tablet's processor will drain the battery faster than it can charge.\n\nI can deal with the over-sharpened screen and would have probably given this thing a five star rating if not for the poor charging capabilities.

Tapping on an application or tapping on the navigation buttons, would cause the tablet to freeze for 4 to 5 seconds.\n\nIt happened once, I said OK it's random, but then it started happening again.\n\nThere are a few asus applications that make the tablet to be loaded on ram hungry services. While individually the services weren't taking much memory, if you put all of them together, they started causing an issue.\n\nI have the 2GB RAM version of the tablet. (z580c).\n\nSo I decided to root and get rid of the extra services and applications from ASUS.\n\nI had to flash android 5 (lollipop) first, because at this moment there's no root possible with android 6. After flashing android 5, and following a nice XDA guide for root, everything was done with success, and with titanium backup I was able to remove all the Asus services and apps, and some google ones as well that I never use (e.g. google plus). I first backed up the apps in case there's needed in the future.\n\nAfter removing the apps and installing Greenify (that allows you to hibernate background applications) everything went back to normal.\n\nNo more freezing, almost half the RAM was used by the tablet, and everything runs smoothly.\n\nIt's a shame that companies decide to bloat their devices with their own software and services that run in the background, resulting a slowed down and worse performing tablet, instead of leaving pure android on it. They're doing a damage to themselves.\n\nSo my recommendation is: if you plan to root and do the actions I mentioned, this tablet is amazing. If not, this tablet is... good, but not smooth enough for my needs...\n\nThe root process was pretty straight forward though and it took around half an hour. It does involve downloading some raw firmware and some tools, and flashing the device with a theoretical risk of damage. But if you've done this before, it shouldn't be anything other than usual.\n\nI hope this is helpful for someone."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "Just a little background about my tablet usage.  I've used iPad 3 which my daughter has, Nexus 7 (2013), Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 (latest & from two years ago) and was looking for a new tablet after my last Nexus 7 broke.  The latest Galaxy Tab 4 is NOT worth the $175 they are charging on Amazon currently and should be a sub $100 tablet.  This ZenPad blows the Galaxy Tab 4 in so many ways it's not even worth comparing.\n\nWith that said the reason why I went with this tablet based on the spec and overall reviews:\n- Has GPS (like most Android tablet)\n- 2K resolution (most sub $200 tablets don't have this)\n- Not too small, not too big\n- Not heavy at all for 8\" tablet (iPad 3 is hefty!)\n- Excellent price\n- Can be rooted (with limitation)\n\nCons:\n- Weak Wifi signal reception\n- Battery doesn't charge with 2A+ fast chargers\n- Not very many accessories especially cases for the tablet\n- Battery life is okay but for heavy gaming & video streaming will take a hit\n- Not a ton of resources and support forums on the tablet\n\nGeneral Impression & Who it's For //\nMy Z580C came with Marshmallow installed.  If you're not familiar with Android, it's the latest operating system that's not only very smooth but has improved battery life over Lollipop.  I've tested with Antutu benchmark and can confirm this is an excellent tablet for multitasking and light/medium gaming.  The score was around 55,000.  The screen is beautiful.  This isn't your regular 1280x pixel cheap tablet marketed as \"HD\" you can see the pixels on the screen.  ZenPad has a screen that's Vibrant, bright and makes watching movies a pleasure.  It's also just the right size for average adult hands to two-hand type in portrait mode.  Since this 8\" tablet is tad wider, I found myself using the portrait mode often whereas with the Nexus 7 I felt landscape mode was much better.\n\nExcellent Tablet for Kids //\nPictured below, ASUS has a 'kids' mode built into this tablet where you designate a 4-digit pin and the home screen turns into a child friendly menu you can customize.  Only parents with the pin can unlock the screen to exit the kids mode.  Considering the price I would pick this over any other tablet on the market right now if performance and strength is a concern.  It has Gorilla Glass 2 which has been tested to be stronger than the current Glass 3.  I would however recommend getting a screen protector (glass based) and a case of course.  I bought \"kwmobile Crystal Case\" here on Amazon for $10 that's been working well.  Sure, there are many kid's tablet on the market but if you'd like to share your tablet but not having to buy two or more tablets then this tablet is very ideal.\n\nBattery Life //\nI would say the battery life is 'okay' as much as I mentioned Marshmallow being a better O/S for battery life.  There's a trade off when it comes to battery size & weight.  It should last most of the day with light web and light duty apps.  There's a balance with the battery size and weight of course.  Considering how heavy the iPad 3 is, this 8\" tablet is on a lighter side which is better for travel in my opinion.  When my daughter was playing Minecraft and gaming for few hours on the ZenPad during a road trip, the battery diminished to under 20% at full brightness.  It has regular micro USB charger port same with most Android phones out there today.  It does come with a 1.3A charger.  I've tried Qualcomm 2.0 & 3.0 charger including other 2amp+ charger but for whatever reason it will not charge unless you use the charger block that came with the tablet.  This is a big disappointment as it takes awhile for the original block to charge.\n\nVideos & Gaming //\nMovies whether it's watching Netflix or YouTube is perfect!  Just the right size, not heavy to hold and screen is bright enough to see during the day and can be dimmed low at night.  As far as gaming I've tested popular game like Minecraft which runs very fluid.  I thought it would struggle with Need for Speed Most Wanted but there was no hiccup which surprised me.  I haven't tested other games that's memory/processor intensive but it seems to have no issues.  Playing Need for Speed did drain the battery faster but also the tablet only got warm to touch.  Not hot like my smartphone when playing the same game.\n\nBluetooth, Wifi & GPS //\nI had an issue that's known with Nexus 7 that the Bluetooth will randomly disconnect as well as the Wifi.  I use tablet in my car for Waze and for navigation where the BT kept disconnecting with the Nexus 7.  I have zero issues with the ZenPad.  Running music in the background and connecting to home Wifi and hotspots I've yet to have any issues.  Even the iPad 3 had Wifi connectivity issue.  Nothing is more aggravating than losing your internet!  The GPS seems very accurate as well.  Since no iPad Wifi version came with GPS that was a deal breaker for me.\n\nUnfortunately the Wifi can be weak if you're behind few walls versus my LG G5 can easily pick up strong Wifi signal, I had hard time getting Netflix to run in HD unless I only had a wall or so to receive the 2.4GHz Wifi.  I'm not sure how well this will work with 5GHz Wifi protocol but was a bit disappointed here as well.\n\nSummary //\nOverall a cost effective tablet with beautiful resolution especially if it's all shipping out with Marshmallow.  Why the deduction of the star?  The battery life can be tad bit better including the fast charging option is not available from my experience. If you're traveling and don't want to take external battery with you then you may find it annoying.  Intel Atom processor is being discontinued for further development by Intel so the support for this tablet may not be all there as far as upgrades on the firmware goes.  Wifi can be spotty behind walls unlike some of the smartphones I have so don't be surprised if it's not picking up a strong signal.  Unlike the more popular tablets there aren't tons of info out there on this tablet especially if you're a power user.  But for the price, it's one of the best tablet I used to date.  ASUS is underrated in many regards.  They are OEM manufacturer for many PC components and are very popular in that area.  I cannot say for their customer support (out of Taiwan) but this is not some no-name brand.\n\nI'll reserve the rest of the review for those wanting to root and customize their Android.\n\n*****DISCLAIMER*****\nI'm not responsible for your bricked tablet!  Do this if you know what rooting is and have done this before.\n\n- Yes you CAN root this Z580C if it's Lollipop (downgrade to Marshmallow to Lollipop otherwise)\n- Bootloader is locked so you CANNOT run custom recovery to flash custom ROM\n- No info on rooting Marshmallow currently\n- I cannot confirm on running Xposed as it seems to crash the Google Play apps as soon as it's flashed via launcher.bat method\n\nIf you want to root this and you end up with a Marshmallow just know you may not be able to go back to Marshmallow.  It took me few hours to really understand to replicate the process through XDA but here goes:\n\n- To downgrade to Lollipop, search Google for \"Hard Brick on Asus ZenPad S8 (Z580CA) or Z580C\" on XDA-Developers\n- Make sure read it carefully and your PC recognizes your tablet (or install ASUS driver)\n- The hard brick / unbrick method is to downgrade to Lollipop with the provided RAW file in link (I had to zip this file to use the Flash tool)\n- Then search Google for \" ZenPad S Root achieved\" also on XDA\n- Make sure you've enabled Developer's Option and turned on USB Debugging\n- If you have no idea what I posted so far read further about rooting before attempting!\n- Install the Super SU file into your tablet or SD Card\n- Make sure once you run the launcher.bat file you select T2 after entering ACCEPT\n- You'll go into the temporary CWM screen and install the Super SU\n- Reboot and you should be rooted!\n\nThat's the simple explanation but once you do this few times you'll understand what you need to do.  Again you cannot go back so if you do decide to wipe using the RAW file make sure you're okay being stuck on Lollipop using the unbrick method."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "A few months back I'd purchased a Samsung 16GB tablet and was quite disappointed with it -- lotss of unwanted, undeletable apps hogging up the limited memory, adding a 132gb SD card to help resolve the issue and then having it repeatedly unseat itself and never quite working properly.  So this time around I decided to go with a tablet that came with 64 gigs of hard drive space and 4 of ram.  My familiarity with Asus came from having had 3 of their PC's (2 desktops, 1 laptop) over the years and never a moment of grief from any of them, so decided to try an Asus tablet.  The reviewers of this tablet seem to fall into the love it or hate it categories with few falling into the mid-range, and many complaints of bloatware.  I have to agree with the bloatware criticisms -- it knocks pretty close to 10gb off the hard drive's available space.  However, quite of bit of these unwanted apps can be deleted (unlike Samsung's) and the Asus makes much better use of the memory gained from the SD card -- it just seems to smoothly piggy-back the SD memory onto the built in memory invisibly.  Now I have so very much space for pictures, videos, games, all my toys on this tablet without having to switch out apps all the time.  The tablet gave me the option to upgrade to Android 6 and politely let me choose to finish downloading my music collection before proceeding; and the upgrade processed without a hitch.\n\nPerformance so far is wonderful, the screen is crystal clear with fabulous color, switches between windows are lag free, just lightning fast, and sound (an issue on previous RCA, Samsung and Kindle Fire tablets) is fine.  The tablet itself is beautiful -- light, slim, easy to handle.  I had read in one of the other reviews that if wifi reception appears to be weak, the tablet should be positioned with the on/off and volume controls on the bottom.  I don't know why this should be so, but it absolutely does work.  Was having trouble with wifi reception when downloading all those gigs of music, and flipping the tablet over resolved the issue completely.  Seems odd that it should make a difference, but it's a small adjustment to make.\n\nOther folks seem to have developed problems after owning the tablet for a few weeks (or months), so I'm trying to curb in my enthusiasm at this point.  If any issues do develop, I'll come back in and modify my review.  But for right now, I love love LOVE this tablet."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "I bought the 64gb/4fb ram model as I wanted the active stylus functionality. It has a great screen and a nice design. The speakers are front facing stereo but aren't very loud. They have no split screen functionality built into their zen UI like Samsung does. And the stylus only works with a few apps and for the stuff to even work, an option needs to be turned on in the tablets setting. Samsung Galaxy tab/note tab or the iPad is so much better of an experience. I'm overall very, very disappointed in this tablet as the stylus barely works, no split screen, and ASUS refuses to update a tablet that was launched December of 2015 to any version of Android above 5.0. Not even 5.0.1! I will never purchase another Asus product again as there is much, much better out there."}

Speed is a small issue, but it is an older model. For my first Android tablet, it was a wonderful buy at the right price. The internal memory was just fine, and the option to add more memory is great also. I will say that I don't use this one everyday, but when I do use it, I enjoy using it. I haven't used it outside, so I can't say how easy it is to use in sunny conditions. Of course the vast amount of options to modify your tablet is always a plus, and I have really enjoyed playing around with it. It has bloatware, but most tablets do, you can get around that. Next Android tablet purchase will have LTE access, instead of just wifi. Overall I am happy with the purchase. The dual front facing speakers are nice, but any Phone or Tablet built in speakers never have superior sound quality, so a good pair of headphones or bluetooth speakers are needed."}

Watching movies, reading e-books, playing games, viewing photos, and streaming audio are all good experiences.\nLots of space - the 32gb leaves you with ~29gb to use after the default apps are set aside.\n\nThe cons:\n\nMinor: Dish Anywhere doesn't support this tablet's processor for offline transfers - note, it doesn't say this anywhere on the Dish Anywhere site.  Only in the support forums will they say it doesn't support the ASUS tablets.  This means you cannot transfer shows from your DVR to the tablet for offline viewing.  They have no plans to address this - you used to be able to install an older version of the app as a workaround, but they recently did a new update that causes old versions of the app to immediately crash.\n\nMajor: It seriously crashes at least every other day.  These are random events where you do anything from waking up the tablet to opening a random application.  Boom. Right to the black screen with the ASUS boot screen.  It has crashed on installed apps (facebook, snapchat) as well as default (the camera button).  I opened the case the other day and the act of waking up from the case being opened caused it to crash.  Sometimes it happens when switching between apps, others it will do it on the first one you open.  Very frustrating."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "Oct 2016 update : marshmallow update completed.  No issues at all.  Tablet seems faster,  screen seems brighter and sharper,  battery life is definitely improved. Note: this update is not OTA.  You have to go the asus website and download the zip file.  There is no rooting involved and of course no voiding of the warranty since Asus has officially released the file.\n\nThis is a great little tablet.  Very powerful (4gB!) and excellent screen.  Between the internal storage and microSD, there is plenty of storage space.  The tablet is lightening fast and never has any issues running multiple apps or accessing the WiFi.  The battery is somewhat undersized but after letting the battery run down to zero several times, I have noticed definite improvement.  Also, placing the battery in ULTRA save mode works wonders and doesnt seem to affect performance adversely.  The screen itself could be a bit brighter but the clarity more than makes up for that.  Yes, ASUS included plenty of bloatware but most of it can be either disabled or uninstalled.  I love the double knock feature to wake the tablet and put it back in sleep mode.  Also, the screen automatically turns on and off when the case cover is opened or closed . The screen size took a bit of getting used to but now I love how light the tablet is and also extremely portable.  I picked up a MOKO case which makes the tablet very easy to handle.  At this price point, the tablet is a steal.  Now ASUS:  update this, your flagship tablet,  to marshmallow and I will be even happier!"}

Asus just loaded too much bloat that can't be removed and uses too much RAM. 2gb was just enough before the update and now's there's not enough."}

Add to that, they release this device and NEVER update the OS version! it's perpetually stuck on 5.0. That's right, not even 5.1, and no hope of 6.0. I called their support line to ask for a refund and they said the warranty only covered repairs, and I would have to ship in my device (what I use to read all my books, watch media, listen to music, and check the news on; in other words, use constantly and have need of every day) and wait for them to send it back months from then.

Even with that in mind the Asus had some serious performance and for what I use the tablet for I'm very satisfied with it. Price was another factor in why I purchased this tablet. Compared to the S2 it's around a $100 cheaper which in my book is a huge plus. I purchased the 4gb ram, 64gb memory because I liked the thought of having a tablet that can perform without lag. Even though you aren't able to upgrade the os it still comes with Android 5.0 and I'm able to root the tablet to customize it and upgrade to Android 6. If your looking for a tablet that can perform for you to watch movies, play games or just get online and check emails then this is definitely going to be a good choice for the price."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "I received this tablet for free from one of my utility companies.  This is the first & probably last time in my life that any company will give away anything of value, so I enjoy it for this reason.  I would not bother purchasing a tablet as I have no known need for one.  Even with this free device, I find I am forcing myself to use it where I would otherwise use my laptop or smartphone.  The size makes it awkwardly to grip, I will drop it sooner or later.  If you use Android on your smartphone, you will adapt smoothly to the ZenPad's OS.  Typing is much better than on a phone, the larger size making it easier to hit the proper key.  I am continuing to find any UNIQUE uses for it--even downloading Apps I never used on my phone.  The video screen has impressive resolution, the touchscreen is as responsive as it needs to be.  I have no trouble synching the device up with my personal & work email, etc....  It comes with some standard software/Apps that I'm still trying to learn to use.  One such App is called \"SuperNote.\"  I guess its like the old PDA where you can write notes on the screen, and it seems to transliterate to the font of your choice.  OR you can just keep your original script and it will place your notes in some sort of order.  Usually these types of electronic PostIt notes are more trouble then they are worth, but I'm willing to give it an honest try.  In short, I have no need for a tablet, but since it was given to me, I'll find uses for it."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "I decided to use the tablet for a few months before I write the review.\n\nThe initial impression was very good. Screen is bright. Light weight. But after using a few months, there are several issues. First, the touch screen is not sensitive. I do not use any screen protector. I have to touch a few times to be recognized, and it happens all the time. When you repeat your touch too fast, it enters the sleep mode.\n\nThe battery does not last long. Intel Atom drains a lot of power during operation. The power can continue to drain pretty quickly in sleep mode compared to my very old Apple products or Samsung products. The wifi has trouble to receive signals. To play back video from youtube or Amazon, it has lag from time to time but my other devices are ok.\n\nAsus obviously customizes their version of Android. And the result is buggy. There are so many software bugs that I can write several pages. For example, I cannot move an app into a folder easily. The folder will move when you drag the app close by. It is like cat and mouse. The auto brightness adjustment fails compared to other products. In the dark, it is too bright and in the bright area t it is too dark. The auto rotation fails from time to time. I disabled it and it can still rotate for some apps. The app can hang or crash very easily. I do not know if it is caused by Android or ASUS's customization. I wish they offer a choice without their poor customization. The apps provided by ASUS do not work well. For example, their mail program does not display the picture automatically. You have to click it to display the picture every time. You cannot swipe the mail to delete the mail. You have to select and click delete.\n\nThe photo and video quality are pretty poor. The same picture in Facebook looks very different in my 5.5\" iPhone and 8\"  ZenPad. The iphone is sharp and clear with good color depth. But ZenPad is blurred and looks pale. I thought larger screen should be better to see the details of a photo. But it is opposite. I cannot figure out why.\n\nI really regret buying this tablet."}

It is a good tablet overall.\n\nUpdate: It's been a couple months since I bought the tablet. I think it is not worth buying. The bloatware is so bad that makes the otherwise wonderful hardware useless. For instance, my microphone gets turned off by the ASUS battery manager app because the google up uses it and 'drains the battery'.

It doesn't have a phone, but if you are tapped into a WiFi, you can do a Skype call. If you buy one, buy a case for it. The case made by a third party protects it, and when it's closed, lets the screen go to sleep without the tablet being turned off. This preserves your battery power and keeps the Zenpad ready for use just by opening the cover. Okay, as you can see, I am impressed. I am going to buy one for my daughter."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "I bought this for my 9 year old with the intent of having him use it under a restricted profile. Be warned, this version of Android doesn't allow access to the add-on SD Card for restricted users unless the app developer specifically includes it in their code. I don't know if Asus can update their camera app but my son can't save any pictures or videos to the SD card nor can he access any of the music or videos I put there. If you will have a restricted user, they will only have access to whatever is left over of the 32GB onboard storage after apps and such are added.\n\nGood: The last tablet was a 7\" Samsung with only 8GB onboard storage that was nearly unusable due to the bloatware duplicated within my admin profile and my son's restricted profile. This tablet doesn't have anywhere near the amount of bloatware. I was able to load a LOT of games and educational apps with about 20GB left over even with 2 profiles.\nThe video looks good and the sound is O.K. (No tablet is going to be a boombox)\n\nBad: No access to the SD card under the restricted profile. I expect the onboard storage to fill up with my son's pictures and videos quickly.\n\nOther thoughts: The 8\" format is just a little too big for me to hold comfortably in one hand. It seems likely that I will eventually tap an icon with one hand and knock the whole thing out of the other hand. This might be less of a problem without the case.\nI had to turn off the \"auto-sleep when case is closed\" because the tablet kept going to sleep when I would fold the cover behind it (MoKo ASUS ZenPad S 8.0 (Z580C/Z580CA) case). I don't know if this is a fault with the case or just that the tablet is so thin it thought the cover was on the front side when it was on the back side.\nI wish the charger were USB Type-C instead of micro-B - faster charging and I don't have to squint to see if I've got it turned the right way to plug it in."}

After that, that is where things start to go downhill. The ZenUI is horrible compared to stock android. The build quality seems subpar after having so many Nexus and Samsung devices. Two issues I had may have been application related, but I would frequently not be able to use my touchscreen while using YouTube and I would frequently get a popping sound from the speakers.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "A good performance tablet at an attractive price point.  The 4Gb RAM provides smooth handling of applications and has very little lag.  Web page scrolling has some occasional stutter but it is very minor.  The display is considered good for an IPS panel.  Images are sharp and color reproduction is good.  When viewing high resolution pictures (large file size), there is a 1 to 2 seconds delay in the rendering time.  The same situation occurs during zooming.  You can see the picture gradually becomes sharp and clear.  This tablet has the ability to treat the external microSD card as if it is part of the internal storage.  This allows apps to be installed directly to the external microSD card.  No need to use \"move to SD card function\".  The camera is the weakest feature on this tablet.  The photo quality is below average but this is not a deal breaker since nobody actually uses a table to take photos.  The dual front-facing speaks is a good implementation and offers decent sounds for games and movies.  However, do not expect \"DTS\" sound quality from those tiny speakers. Another weak point of this tablet is the brightness of  the panel.  The panel is not bright and you have to crank the brightness setting to at least 70% to be usable indoors.  As a comparison, with a Samsung Galaxy S5, a brightness setting of 35% gives the same \"brightness appearance\" as the Asus ZenPad display at 70%."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "I was lucky enough to snag a used one of these in very good condition for only $98, what a steal! Even at the current $169 for a brand new one direct from Amazon that's a really good deal. For comparison, I used to have an iPad Air 2 through my previous job, and needed to replace that with something out-of-pocket and didn't want to shell out what it would cost to get an iPad. I've found that this isn't quite as fast as the Air 2, but it's still pretty snappy considering it's so much cheaper. The screen is beautiful, maybe even nicer than the Air 2. I find that I prefer the 8\" screen to the 9.7\". I think it's the sweet spot of being just big enough that it's a lot more useful than a smartphone, but it's still just small enough that it's comfortable to hold one-handed for extended periods of time while reading/browsing. The one concern I had prior to purchasing was that this only runs Android 5 Lollipop and not the newest version 6 Marshmallow and may never get an update to 6 given Asus's track record with tablets, but after researching this further, I think that shouldn't be much of an issue for the next 2 years, and if I can get 2 years out of a tablet this cheap, I'm definitely satisfied with that! Even 1 year would be fine."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "After 7 months with the tablet (purchased new), the touch of the touchscreen has ceased working. After trying everything including a factory reset, I will need to send it back to Asus since it has a 1-year warranty. I will update this to let you know how that process goes. Incidentally, we were happy with the ASUS ZenPad S 8 Z580 tablet up until that point.\n\nUpdate 1: So ASUS has had my tablet for over 2 weeks now and there has been no progress with it whatsoever. Although they have acknowledged that they have received the tablet and even sent me an email confirming that, their \"Repair Status\" page still says that they haven't. They've \"escalated\" and \"passed\" the case on 3 times and counting now, each time with the statement \"You should hear something within 24 - 48 hours\". Of course, nothing ever happens. Now I'm waiting on a call from the \"manager\" which I should get in, you guessed it, 24-48 hours from their call center in Jamaica.\n\nIf you buy this tablet, I hope it works because if you have to send it in to ASUS, you might as well forget it. I think they're going to hold on to it until the warranty runs out in a few months and then send me a bill.\n\nThis will be my last ASUS purchase.\n\nUpdate 2: The RMA was missing the serial number. Three weeks later and they have found the serial number of the device. Maybe something will actually happen now.\n\nUpdate 3: Finally received the tablet back after almost 8 weeks. Tablet worked for 6 weeks. Exact same problem again! Touchscreen no longer works. Luckily it's still under warranty although not for long. Hopefully they'll actually fix it or send me a new one but I worry that it'll get fixed until the warranty runs out and then break again. This has been the worst experience I've ever had with any piece of technology.\n\nUpdate 4 (11-28-16): Just got it back from ASUS repair for the second time. They did not replace it, only fixed it again (their customer service guy said they usually replace it if it shows up with the same problem for a second time - guess not!). No explanation or anything, it just shows up in a box. So the countdown begins once again. This time though, the warranty will run out. I'll be sure to contact them though if it does die again.\n\nUpdate 5: Surprise! The tablet touch died again and it's out of warranty. Since they've never fixed it the first time, I'm going to contact them and give them a chance to replace it. This is beyond the ridiculous stage. I can understand a tablet breaking and it getting fixed. The second time, in my opinion, they should've replaced it. This third time, I feel they should just send me a new tablet and allow me to stomp on this one until it's completely destroyed.\n\nUpdate 6: Received a new tablet back after a few weeks. They finally replaced instead of repaired it. As of 4/2/2017, the new one is still working. I wonder how much money was spent by them for this whole process."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "I don't want to repeat what's already been said in the reviews, but I want to contribute to the good reviews of this tablet.\nI've owned it for a few weeks already and I have absolutely no complaints about it. Yes, the Asus preinstalled UI can be a bit confusing for people like me who are already used to the stock android experience, but that's easily solved by installing the launcher of your preference. I'm using Nova Launcher and it runs perfectly well. The same can be said about the millions of preinstalled apps. Sure, there's a lot of them, but they won't bother you if you leave them alone.\nMy favorite thing about this tablet is the screen. The 4:3 aspect ratio is absolutely wonderful for reading books and comics. As for the brightness, it's good enough: I've used it to read directly under the sun and while it's not perfect, you can read just fine.\nThe performance of this tablet has been amazing so far. Changing between apps is fast and fluid. Zooming in and out, even in heavy pages in Chrome, is a delight. It comes with Android Lollipop 5.0 and we don't know if we'll ever see an update, but it works very well and I've had no problems at all with it.\nOf course, the 32 GB of internal storage are a huge plus. I love being able to install every app that looks fun.\nBattery life is decent. No, it's not amazing, but I use it a lot during the day for reading and playing a few games and I only need to charge it when I'm going to sleep. That's good enough for me.\nCharging is fast enough with the charger that comes with the tablet. It takes a few and a half hours to reach from 5~10% to 100%. Again, that's good enough for me.\nAs for the exterior design, yes, it looks as good as it looks in the promotional pictures. Also, I've read some complaints about the power button. I barely use it because I also bought a smart cover, so I never really have to manually lock or unlock the screen, but both the power and volume buttons need some good pressure and are not uncomfortable to use at all. I control the volume all the time, so I know.\nSpeaking about the audio, the quality is good enough. It's not amazing, but again, it's good enough. I don't use my tablet to listen to music or watch movies, so it's not really that important for me, as long as it sounds good. And it does.\nI have no comments about the camera because I've never used it. But I don't know, why would you buy a tablet for its camera?\n\nTL;DR: A tablet with excellent performance if you do the normal stuff (read, check your mail, browse the internet and play some games). Decent battery life. Good screen and pretty design. In short, if you want a good tablet for doing regular stuff, go for it!"}

My disappointment with the tablet is due to the microphone deciding to no longer work. It was working just fine until a few weeks ago, and then, nothing. This has happened before and I managed to get it working again. I've had no such luck this time. I cannot recommend this device due to that rather glaring flaw.

From what I've read, this tablet is pretty easily rootable as well so if you really need that level of control, the option is available.\n\nThe only cons I can really think of are the lack of proper accessories (there's a lot of third party cases/keyboards that just look weird) and it'll probably lose software support soon (rooting can solve this issue), but otherwise it's a top-notch tablet."}

Instead what I found was a high res display that simply used 2x more dots to create the same items.  No you can't have more than one app active at a time.  The built in image viewer only allows 1/10th magnification of other android devices with only 1200 x800 displays.  Plus it won't lock in at max magnification, but instead springs back to a smaller size.\n\nYou may think the camera is good enough for basic pictures, but trust me it isn't even good enough to take a picture of a check for a mobile bank deposit.  The camera is the worst of any asus android device I've ever used or owned.  The camera has trouble focusing and tons of noise in less than perfect lighting.  My me173x and me181 both were able to quickly focus and take the same picture without any issues.  I preformed the test with 4 different bank's mobile apps, only to have them all complain the pictures were unusable.  In perfect lighting the camera still under preforms against the other 5mp cameras.  Even though i had the camera set for 5mp / fine it still preformed as a 2mp camera..  Which leads me to believe it truly isn't a 5mp optical camera, but instead a 5mp interpolated.  All I needed in a camera was one capable of taking pictures of documents and research material I need to copy when doing research at the library.  It couldn't even do that.\n\nThe unit I got had a really old android 5.0 OS installed.  Given my experience with ASUS, it will never be updated, so don't hold your breath.\n\nI probably could have lived with the crappy camera and outdated OS provided the gps worked really well in a car.  As it turned out the GPS in my unit was DOA.\n\nWhich gave it 3 strikes and a less that 24 hour turn around back to Amazon.\n\nSo what are the pros you my ask,  I only report on what the manufacturers leave out of their descriptions."}

I can now recommend this tablet with 5 stars!\n---------------------------------------------------------------\nI recently purchased my ZenPad S 8 (4GB/16GB) to replace the miserable Kindle Fire HD 8 that I had stuck myself with. I am an IT professional with 25 years of experience.  I am not only an avid user of smartphone and tablet technology, I write apps for them. That being said, I can tell you with much expertise, that you will not find a better, more feature-rich tablet, in this price range.  I've read a few complaints about the battery-life of this unit, but let me explain something to you, NEVER is the battery life, what is actually advertised. I don't care who makes the product.  The truth is, this tablet does really well.  I have put in an hour and a half of gaming, then watched a 2 hour movie, and ended up surfing around the web and posting on Facebook for about an hour, before feeling any need to reach for the power cable.  The image quality and sound are excellent. Some have complained about the speakers not being loud enough. My response - c'mon people, it's a tablet.  The speaker are pretty nice, front-facing, and don't distort, that's about as much as you can ask.  Want to hear some excellent sound, plug it into some good external speakers.  Most of us use headphones.  That leads to my only complaint, the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars. When you connect Bluetooth Headphones, it disables your WIFI connection.  This is pretty annoying.  I sincerely hope this is a software issue that ASUS will rectify in a future update.  However, given the excellent quality of both the design and performance of this device, I'm willing to be pretty forgiving.  If you are looking for a tablet in the sub $300 range, you won't find better. Highly recommended. Oh, and for those of you who say you didn't get a charger? I did, a nice little charging brick and cord. Are you folks sure you got everything out of the box?"}

I hypothesize that many people buy from second and third tier vendors who sell refurbed and/or returned units. That is the only explanation that I can come up with that makes sense. I bought an Harman Kardon Onxy Studio II speaker for $125 off Amazon when they sold for $199 to $429 at the time. One of the speakers gives off a slight \"rattling sound\" that my other Onyx speaker (bought Best buy on sale for $199) does not. This occurs only during bass heavy music where I have the volume and bass up higher than usual. It still sound better than any other BT speaker in the +$300 range so I kept it!\n\nThis model (64GB) is no longer available from the ASUS website. That may mean there was indeed problems with some of the tablets. The 32GB unit is still available for $179 at ASUS website. They are still a bargain at that price. the 32GB will beat or be as good as any +$400 tablet!\n\n***UPDATE 7-3-16****\nI ended up returning the Z580C and bought the Z580CA (4 GB memory, 64GB internal storage, works with an active stylus). The active stylus and memory are the only differences. All other specs are the same. I paid $269 pre-tax, government  enforced recycling fees (taxes by any other name...), and it was shipped free directly from Asus, stylus also.\n\nI opted for the CA model primarily for the active stylus support, with memory and storage being secondary.\n\nI have been using this daily for about a month  and have no regrets (well actually one regret: I wish I had had kept the C model also!). It is fast, the display is top notch, and responsiveness has not been an issue.\n\nI did change the color settings to standard settings (no adaptive display etc.). I set animations and transitions to 0 and this things flys! Every negative review comment about some problem with the tablet, has just not happened to me and could not duplicate when trying. I believe many reviewers bought the tablet refurbished maybe? They do not know enough about changing the settings when and if needed? Got a lemon? I do not know. My Galaxy Tab S is faster and has a better display, but not by much.\nUpdates to its Android OS may not happen...I do not see that as a negative. Get anti-virus protection if that is your main worry. My Galaxy S5 phone was just update to Marshmallow 6. X.X, it now has glitches and the icons have changed so I have to get used to them now. I have tablets with Android 4.4 (kit Kat?) and would not trade them in. The obsession with updates is WAAAAY overplayed. Only Apple users are usually that myopic.\nI still do not see why these tablets are not among the top 5 in rankings for tablets costing $400 (yes, even though this is $299 here) and of this aspect ratio. Reviewers complained about the USB C type adapter. Yes you have to have a specific cable for this, all I did was order a couple of USB 2 to USB C adapters ($7) and stuck them on some extra cables I had. I now have every length and color of cable I want, available to use with this tablet!\nIt charges faster than the average tablet and the battery lasts for at least 7 hours of video, surfing, reading. READING! I put a matte/anti-glare on the tablet and it makes for easier reading, dulls the videos a bit but not enough to complain.\nI will update if I have any problems\n\n====ORIGINAL REVIEW FOLLOWS====\n\nDisclaimer: I have only been using this for one week, though constantly, and exploring all device options.\n\nFor the price, this is an absolute steal! I bought mine as an open box for $133, but even the retail price is a bargain. Lightweight, sturdy and very attractive.\nThere is little to no lag (contrary to what I have read in the reviews here on amazon).\n\nIt does come loaded with the usual manufacturer bloatware, but they can be disabled quite easily.\n\n2GB memory is good, standard for decent tablets. The 32GB storage is a plus. I usually add an SD card  (and will with this one), which will give me a total of 148Gb free.\n\nI do not get some of the reviewers complaining (too much) about the user interface. It is a very good interface. It takes some getting use to if you have been using other manufacturer tablets/UIs. The UI has many easy and useful features. One thing I am puzzled by is the lack of touch feedback. There is no option for sound or vibration when typing. I like this feature and do miss it.\n\nThe speakers are at the top and bottom front of the tablet and sound good for tablet speakers. Sounded slightly tinny when listening to \"Dirty White Boy\" by Foreigner, but good and smooth watching The Last Witch Hunter. The speakers play at a volume load enough to hear in a crowded room.\n\nIt has the capability to use a 128GB sd card which is great for me. I load anywhere from 10-15 movies at a time, over 1,000 books (mostly public domain), and discologies from my favorite bands. Room to spare. Apple users take note of this. The SD card cost under $50. Internal memory is faster but makes NO difference when playing music, occasionally watch movies, and when reading books.\n\nThe screen resolution of 2048x1536 gives 320ppi which renders text sharp and clear, NO jagged edges. I bought this mainly for e-reading and music. It is easy on my eyes when reading.\n\nI have 4 other tablets besides the zen pad reviewed here: Galaxy Tab S;  Acer Iconia 7.85; Amazon Fire HD 7\"; Insignia Flex Elite. The Tab S was my main tablet, the Zen Pad S is now my number one tablet. Quality of screen does not beat the Tab S but all around I like it better and would have bought the zen pad had I done my research prior to buying the Tab S. If anyone wants to buy my Tab S (Pristine condition) let me know."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "What could be wrong about a tablet with specs like these? Well, apparently I underestimated how important finesse is in the creation of a tablet. This was not my first ASUS tablet; I still own a Google Nexus 7 (first edition) and it does better in some ways than this new ASUS tablet (more on that later). I read some negatives concerning this tablet here in the tablet's review section but at the time attributed these to possible user inexperience or other factors -- in short I was eager to get my hands on this tablet due to its great specs and my past experience with the ASUS-built Nexus 7. Even though I came to this tablet biased in a positive way, I ended up returning it because of its faults which were too glaring to overlook.\n\nOut of the box, the Z580CA looks good, sleek, thin, and has some nice sturdiness and substance to it. It feels solid. The screen has great resolution and is sufficiently bright, although I thought the default color profile was a bit washed out so I changed it to \"Vivid\" which was better for me. The processor seems to load apps quickly and the 64gb internal storage seems to perform well too (for example when transferring files to the tablet from PC, which went pretty fast). Having 4gb of RAM on a tablet such as this is a great thing on paper.\n\nNow for the cons. From the start, I noticed that at times (many times) I had to press the screen twice or three times for it to respond when trying to click a button or get into an app menu. At first I thought I just had to get used to my new tablet, but this problem never let up. I came to the conclusion that this tablet's touch is finicky and somewhat unresponsive. I've noticed slight lags or stutters or missfires on other tablets where it comes touch capabilities, but with this ASUS tablet the problems are so pronounced that it actually bothered me a lot.\n\nOne of the main reasons I purchased this tablet is so I could use it to read PDF's and (other) ebooks. A lot of these PDF's are scans from actual books and may be anywhere from 3mb to 50mb in size. My favorite apps for PDF's are Moon+ Reader Pro and Adobe Acrobat. I had been using these apps on my old Nexus 7 and other tablets without any problems (though the Nexus is a tad slow, of course). I was expecting this new tablet to just cut through scanned PDF's like butter with its fast processor and 4gb of RAM. Instead, turning pages was accompanied by lag and stutters and freezes. I tried changing all kinds of settings (especially in Moon+ Reader as it can be customized plenty) but my reading experience was never fluid or satisfactory. I was starting to think that maybe the books I have don't display very well on these higher resolution screens or something, or that the reader apps weren't optimized for high end tablets. I didn't know what to think. I was starting to feel disappointed rather than excited about my new tablet.\n\nI then put a bunch of music files (.flac and .mp3) on the device. I thought the front stereo speakers were very nice, better than most tablets I've worked with (except perhaps the Kindle Fire HD with its great speakers). Of course, I don't listen to music much through the tablet speakers, but plug in my headphones instead. Listening to audio over headphones, besides e-reading, is the other main purpose of tablets for me. I use Sennheiser HD239 headphones on tablets most of the time because they are easily driven by mobile devices, have great range, and are compact and light. To my great disappointment, the audio feed through the headphone outlet was plagued by static and buzzing noises. Exactly the same thing I had some years ago when I bought a cheap Win8 tablet for $99, which I returned for that reason. Basically, once you plug your headphone into this ASUS tablet, it detects it and puts it into headphone mode (an icon appears on top left). You may hear a coming on and off of the sound (like a buzz or airy sound, which then cuts off). Once you start up an audio player (my favs are JetAudio or AIMP) and play a song, you will hear the audio feed in general 'activate' first, like a slight pop or buzz. This buzz or static continues, but once a song starts you may not be aware of it because the sounds of the music drown it out. But play a quiet song or especially a track with actual \"silence\" in it, and you may/will hear this static noise. Having at least 3 quality headsets I tested them all and all had the same problem -- mind you, the Nexus 7 from 2012 is excellent with all these headsets. So I wondered if the problem was due to a faulty connection inside the headphone outlet, like it not making contact well. So I put a little pressure on the jack in different directions, and sure enough I was able in one position to minimize and almost eliminate the static noise. Problem was, there's nothing you can do about that to fix this. The old Nexus 7 by ASUS has an all-metal casing for the headphone jack, which I think is much better. Plus you shouldn't be able to hear the audio come \"on\" or go \"off\" once audio activates. In my opinion this is a very cheap implementation of audio on this device and even if the actual outlet problem would be fixed I think the audio feed through the headphone jack might still be inferior. I understand that tablet-makers try to get their tablets as thin as possible, etc., but it should never compromise quality. Headphone outlets these days are little more than holes with a tiny metal connector inside. Quality is primary, form-factor is secondary. Hopefully they can go hand in hand. Adding 1 millimeter for an hour more battery life would not be frowned upon by consumers as much as tablet-makers like to think. Etc.\n\nAll these negatives made me return this tablet, even though it has such great specs on paper. My conclusion was that it's one thing to throw a highly specced tablet together, but that it takes true finesse and testing and good software implementation to indeed create a great tablet. Not sure what ASUS is doing but they need to step up their game and really test their stuff and not cut corners. I noticed they are down-speccing their new/coming tablets and seem to be leaving the high end to Apple and Samsung. Probably the right decision at this point.\n\nI still needed a tablet with similar specs so I started looking around on Amazon but wasn't really considering Samsung because the last time I checked a similarly specced Samsung tablet was around $399 (vs the $270 ASUS). But then I noticed that the price of the Samsung S2 Tab 8.0 (32gb storage, 3gb RAM) had dropped to $299... I watched some video reviews on that tablet and decided to buy it locally last night at BlestBye which also had it on sale for $299. So how does it compare and does it suffer from the same problems? It is much better. No more weird touch unresponsiveness; no audio problems through headphones whatsoever (no weird audio activating/de-activating pops or static noise); my e-reader apps work much more fluently. Battery life on the Samsung seems to be somewhat better than the ASUS tablet. The screens on both tablets are great but I think the Samsung one drains the battery less. I did like the ASUS screen's crispness and clarity, but the Samsung screen is also very good (both have same resolution though different tech). Would I have liked 64gb of storage and 4gb of RAM on the Samsung tablet? I sure would have, but given the fact that there is less storage and less memory the Samsung still outshines the ASUS tablet in the tasks I perform on my tablets. Overall the S2 Tab 8.0 is clearly the better tablet. I also appreciate the physical home button on the Samsung because it's just such an easy way to get out of apps and back to the home screen. The S2 tablet body is also designed with more finesse than the ASUS; the ASUS had slight bumps on the chrome-looking edge around the tablet, although I did really like the brushed back and different textures on the ASUS. Things are always a mixed bag, but really for $299 the Samsung is the better tablet, however much I wanted to like the ASUS."}

I know now that the one I bought from Best Buy is the one I should have kept- the 32 GB even had different software. The reason Best Buy never  carried the 64 GB is because they knew this was really the ZenPhone without the phone. THAT is also the reason the camera is subpar too.\n\nAlthough Google now locates me in the U.S., I still receive strange ads geared toward Indian consumers and even Amazon-courtesy of Google- directed what looked to be their British site. I mostly use this tablet to store offline apps. I am afraid to use it for much else. I expected much more. If you decide to purchase this tablet stick to the 32 GB. That was impressive - even the camera was better. Do not waste your money on this tablet\n\nI have had this product since January. Now the software on the phone says it is a ZenFone. I have a feeling this seller is selling foreign merchandise. I have just started the process of contacting ASUS. Beware of this seller.\nThis could be a fluke and I will update my progress.

The original tablet was managing to crash the router on a regular basis, but the replacement has only done it once or twice in 3 months.

This fault downgrades it further to one star - Asus are not interested in fixing it.\n\nOriginal Review:\nThis only applies to the UK version (different spec I think?) Just had a replacement delivered because first one suffered internet connectivity problems: Would drop wifi connection on a regular basis, and even when connected, would just not communicate properly on any app requiring TCP. Pings would work fine, but anything TCP related was either slow or no comms at all. Tried googling (on another machine!) to see if this was a known fault, but without success. Having done some more searching, there would appear to be a quality control issue on this model, so maybe it was just a faulty unit, but a very strange fault, which I have not seen before. Also, you need to stand your ground with ASUS customer services, who seem to just read from a script and trot out the usual '...and now we will fix the fault with a factory reset...!!'  The replacement has only been up and running for 2 days, but is already showing worrying signs similar to the first!"}

The screen is bright and clear, the sound is great for a tablet, it's wonderfully responsive.  The form factor is wonderful, it's thin and light, and the screen doesn't seem to accumulate fingerprints like crazy.  Video is nice and smooth.  It charges rapidly - from 0 to 100% in less than 2 hours which was far better than my nexus 7 which started taking 8 hours after all the updates.  I love having the stylus support - it allows me to doodle.  The included photo manipulation apps are nice.  Battery life is somewhere between 8 and 10 hours depending on what I'm doing.  I love the fact that it has external memory support.  If you're looking at a Samsung Galaxy S2 8 inch tablet and don't want to spend that much, this is the best alternative out there.  I've played with both, and the only difference in features is the screen type and CPU.  To me there was a negligible difference between the Zenpad's 2K TruVivid IPS vs Samsung's AMOLED screen.  I'm quite ecstatic with this beautiful and zippy tablet!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "I've been using the Zenpad 8 580CA for about 2 weeks now without a problem of any kind\n\nPros:\n4GB of RAM where most tablets have 2 or even just 1.\n64 GB storage.\nMicro SD card for expanded storage.\n2.3ghz quad core processor.\n2048x1536 display. ASUS calls the display stunning & it is! I did read negative comments about ASUSs Blur-Free Motion which is supposed to smoothen the video play quality. I disabled it & haven't experienced any problems with playback.\nVery high AnTuTu benchmark score of 38472. Test summary \"Your device is incomparable, this is your world!\".  Details: CPU: Good, Supports large apps & multitasking. RAM, 2D graphics, 3D graphics all excellent - \"fluently supports large mobile games\".\nThe thin 8-inch form is very comfortable & easy to hold & use.\nUSB-C connector/cable for quick charging.\nFront facing stereo speakers.  Good sound from a thin tablet.\nStrong dual-band Wi-Fi.\n\nCons:\nPlastic not metal build. It doesn't really feel it especially with a case but what can you expect for a sub $300 tablet.\nThe camera lens sticks out a bit from the case. It isn't really noticeable but does take away a little from the sleek, narrow form.\nNo camera flash.\nUSB-C Connector. It needs a different USB cable from all the micro-USB devices. C type is suppose to be the new standard so I guess we just have to live with both types for a while.\nUSB cable. A short 3.3 ft. so don't plan to stray far from the charger\nASUS software. You can read this ad nauseum in the reviews. The Zenpad comes with a lot of ASUS pre-loaded bloatware. Much of it can be removed or disabled but not all. The good thing is that with 4GB of RAM these added running apps don't take up much of the available memory. I agressively utilize ASUS's supplied Auto-start Manager & my typical RAM usage with no user apps running is about 30% or a little higher.\nAndroid OS. ASUS is known for not updating the OS of its devices not even flagship tablets. The Zenpad 8 will update to Android 5.0 but that is it. Android 5.0 was notorious for a large memory leak. This was supposedly fixed in 5.1. ASUS will not state whether it will receive Android 6.0 (Marshmallow).  I have an ASUS TF701T 10-inch tablet. This was ASUSs flagship tablet a couple of years ago. It is still running Android 4.4.2. the lack of updates gets aggravating but you learn to live with it.\n\nOther than the OS the other Cons are pretty nit picky.\n\nI cant comment on the ASUS supplied ZenUI since I use 3rd party launcher, browser, file manager & other apps.\n\nMy typical usage is as an eBook reader and web browser.  I should note that I'm not into hard-core gaming nor do I much use my tablet for photos. The pictures that I did take came out quite good.  I did play some 1080p movies stored on internal 64GB, a micro SD card & streamed from Netflix & my Plex server. All played flawlessly with no stuttering. Again, a great display.\n\nAbsolutely no second thoughts over this purchase - a great tablet at a very reasonable price. . Overall it is very comparable to the iPad Mini at a much lower price.\n\nIt should get 5 stars but I'm dinging it 1 star for the Android OS issue.\n\nOther tablets: Amazon Kindle Fire, Google Nexus 7 (OG), Google Nexus 7 (2013), ASUS Transformer TF700T, ASUS Transformer TF701T, & Lenovo Miix-2 (Win 10).\n\nUpdate 08 August 2016. Everything in the above review still stands. Previously my Nexus 7 2013 was my go to tablet. Not anymore. I use the ASUS everyday and have not had a single problem. It would have 5 stars but still no OS update & it wasn't in ASUS's list of devices scheduled for the marshmallow update.\n\nUpdate 05 October 2016\nASUS finally got around to posting an Android Marshmallow update (6.0). The only drawback is it is not over the air but must be done manually. The process is quite simple and fairly quick.\nI've been using the 6.0 update for a while and everything runs very smoothly. Plus, the Android 5.0 memory leak is gone.\nI have used the Zenpad Z580CA for over six months on a daily basis and have not had a single problem with it."}

The family's collection starts with a hisence 7 on the low end up to a couple of iPads on the high. In looking at the reviews on the 64 GB model I have seen complaints of the tab rebooting unexpectedly. This can be a sign of a defective unit but most sellers have very reasonable return policies. It's a pain but it's also a solution that only takes some time. Before you send it back take advantage of some of my experience.  Tablets hate cases and covers! These devices generate heat and covers hold the heat causing the system to freeze or reboot as it tries to deal with the over heating. If you are experiencing these problems try using your tab without the case.  You will very likely see that your problem is solved. Cases do help protect your tab in transporting it. I use sleeves that the tab is covered until I need it. Most tabs are made with textured backs that make one handed holding easy. Give it a try."}

The dumb charger and connector is not mini-HDMI like most every other android device, but instead some slightly different charger that is supposed to be convenient because it fits both ways instead of only one way like standard charger.  Asus markets this as advantage,and some may see it as such I suppose, but I suspect that, like myself, most users will find it just extremely annoying to not be able to charge this in any one of the dozens of cables lying around my house, car, work. Instead I have to have their specific charger. It's just insane that they would have made this decision."}

There's really no other tablet that comes close at this price and features 2gbRAM/32GBstorage. I have bought one back in February to try out for myself and really liked it. Since then, I bought another one for my 6 year old. He does a lot of educational programs like Lexia, Starfall and games such as NFS, Minecraft, Lego, pbskids, etc... The apps run much faster than a more expensive Samsung tablet. The only minor drawback that I would say is the brightness level of the display screen. I always have it set to my preference instead of automatic because automatic mode is quite dim.  I guess the default setting is dimmer than usual to save battery.  It's very minor con that can be easily adjusted in the display settings."}

Lots of goodies you can get for free using the ZENui app. As for battery life - I learned long ago you can get much longer usable time if you do not have a multicolored background (like the default background) - I'm using a starry night as a background - not so many pixels are lit up - less battery drain.

I'm not saying an update to Marshmallow will not come out however, there have been no announcements to indicate it will.  It is hard to believe this device is billed as premium with such terrible support.  If/When the bootloader is unlocked custom ROM's could be developed but there is no indication from ASUS this will happen either.\n\nIt is worth pointing out even though this has a 64 bit CPU, the version of android running is 32 bits.

I like the KF HDX, yet get frustrated when my apps try to update to a prior version. The Fire continued to reinstall apps I had side loaded until I disabled this feature. I was also want direct access to all of my apps on the Google Play store.\n\nAfter loading all of my apps on the ASUS ZenPad 8, I did a direct comparison on how fast it was compared to my KF HDX. The KF HDX beat it every time by by a few seconds. Some apps took 5-10 seconds longer on the ZenPad. I do not play video style games, so I don't have the comparison here. The only game I use is a solitaire card game. I mostly use it for reading apps, and internet surfing. Also some podcasting, and NetFlix watching.\n\nI am returning the ZenPad and have ordered the ZenPad Z580CA, which has the faster clock speed and more RAM.\n\nUpdate: Just received and loaded apps on Z580CA. The faster clock speed / ram makes a difference. It equals or beats my Fire HDX in response time. My KF HDX 7 is no slouch in spec comparisons, yet the lack of Play Store is still a big negative to me.\n\nI am having issues with the speakers. My KF HDX blows the ZenPad away in sound. The presets are all identical, and I do not know what the suggested equalizer settings are, as I have no documentation.\n\nI am also having touch sensitive issues on the screen around the edges, and in a strip bisecting the screen left to right in portrait mode. May have to return it if it gets worse. A power on/off did appear to help, yet in certain spots around the middle of the screen, it will not respond to the double tap to wake / sleep the screen."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "Really liked this device. The screen is awesome, I believe it's QHD if I'm not mistaken. It's also really light. You can game on it too if you want and they'll run smoothly. Everything is pretty quick considering it's got 4gb of ram. I never even thought about getting the lower spec one.\n\nWhat I don't like about it is the poor battery life. Sometimes when people say it online, it's true. With only 4000 mAh, you're really not going to get a lot of on time without charger in this device. In reality, you should be fine using it 5 hours daily without charger and recharge it again. But if you are kind of a heavy user, like you use it more than you do your PC or laptop for media consumption and stuff, you'll constantly have to recharge this device. I am used to being able to charge my tablets every other day. This tablet will only give you 5 hours without plugging in. Sometimes, 6 hours. It depends how frequent you use it. Of course it consumes a lot of power because of its features and screen size. Other flagship tablets with this size screen and quality can last double the battery life of this tablet.\n\nAlso, update is not really that fast. Well, this is not nexus, and it's intel so that's acceptable.\n\nIf you don't mind the battery, go on, try this. If you do, I recommend you choose a different one."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "For a flagship tablet, using Android 5.0 is a bit odd to me. With this decision, battery life suffers. The battery itself is pretty small. Believe it's about 4000mhz. Outside of that, the tablet is amazing. Snappy action, great feeling glass, and light weight. The screen is gorgeous. It's a pleasure to use for reading on the couch, like I used to with books. Once it gets Android 6+ (if it does, Asus has only announced 6 for the Zenfone line only) I will change my rating to either 3 or 5. It's crazy to think the flagship line is held back like this, and it really affects the usage time you have."}

The aspect ratio was, at first, difficult to get used to, having just come from  narrower devices (Lenovo S8 and Nexus 7).  My hand is barely big enough to hold the Asus in portrait mode, but now that I have a rubbery case for it, my grip is secure, and I just love this size and shape.  Excellent views from very oblique angles.  Screen is very responsive to various finger gestures.  Speakers sound clear but as with most tabs the volume is not overwhelming.  I have the 2GB RAM version, and it seems completely adequate for my needs. Videos are smooth and crisp.  WiFi range is identical to my previous tablets as well as an iPad I use.  Asus includes some nice features, like the SuperNote app, which allows a wide selection of handwriting features, great for note taking, diary, drawing, composition, etc.  And there's an intriguing tablet-PC linkage feature I haven't had time to explore. Plus an app for Asus tech support, repair orders, etc, but I don't anticipate needing that.  Last but not least, I took a chance on one of Amazon's 'refurbished' devices - and wow, that was genius.  It came in a plain cardboard box, but I am certain it was brand new. Not even a fingerprint, and all the stickers were still on it. Saved $40 off the already amazing low price.

Downloading apps is fast with the 4 gigs of ram and the videos attached to the app. As others have said that the sound is not that great I found to be true but I have a couple of Bluetooth speakers that are just good for hearing. Did not have to make adjustments to settings for wake sleep mode. If I wasn't looking at the screen it went dark. Pick it up to look and it woke up to where we left off. I don't usually write reviews but after reading others and the questions asked. Thought I would add my 2 cents."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "You can remove or disable most of the bloatware, but the never-a-good-idea \"boost\" app doesn't seem to even have settings, let alone a way to disable it. The most you can do is remove the shortcut from the quick settings panel. The quick settings panel itself has very limited customization. There are eight tools (Calculator, AudioWizard, Boost, Screenshot, Auto-Start Manager, Camera, Quick memo, Mirror), and you MUST select at least four for the list. You must also select eight of the NINE settings shortcuts for the panel. It's not as bad as the tool selection, as those are mostly standard Android shortcuts.\n\nThe biggest problem is there is no way to fully turn off the automatic brightness. Even after turning off the normal \"automatic brightness\" next to the brightness slider, the battery saver, the sort of hidden \"hint of ultra-saving mode,\" AND the \"detect battery-draining apps\" option, the screen still changes brightness on its own. It also adjusts the contrast for videos, so the screen becomes sort of dull and gray for a few seconds after watching a video.\n\nThe comiXology app also has an issue on this device where HD comics appear blurry to the point of illegibility, but the standard resolution ones work fine. However, a device like this is exactly what the HD comics were made for, and it's unfortunate you can't take advantage of it.\n\nThe ZenUI launcher is pretty impressive, with many customization options, and the pixel density results in great image quality. I've heard people say it doesn't get very bright, but like my Moto G and Nexus 7, I find the brightness too bright at max, and keep it about halfway. You can double tap the screen to wake it, and double tap the status bar to turn the screen off, which is very convenient."}

Was considering the g pad 2 but the specs seemed lackluster and the style underwhelmed me. I have never like Samsung phones or tablets. Felt cheap to me and hated touchwiz and all the bloatware. But I needed a new high end tablet. So off to go check out the Samsung galaxy tab s2 8. Gotta say, loved the screen. Incredible!! Fast and zippy and felt premium. I finally understood what all the hoopla was about. But the price of $399 bothered me. It wasn't much different than the previous version and had a weaker battery. Plus 4:3 aspect ratio was tough for me. And that stupid hard home button. Why??? I soon realized that Samsung is more concerned about making an Apple type tablet. What they should be doing is making the best Android tablet. Anyway, I was going to purchase the Samsung then I accidentally saw the Asus and I was sold.\n\nI couldn't believe how much it felt like the Samsung. Beautiful screen, zippy performance. Same 4:3 screen but no hard home button. Yes, I was enthralled. This tablet for its price is incredible. I do realize the specs are somewhat less than the Samung but it's half the price. Also front facing speakers. Great sound. Samsung has both speakers on the bottom in portrait mode. Horrible once you tilt the screen. I was I impressed by the Intel chip, the premium feel and amazing screen. Lots of memory too, plus sd card support. Is this thing really $179.00? Would never of thought of this tablet. A hidden gem in the tablet world. I've used HTC, LG, Nexus products and have always been happy. I was very nervous getting this but love it now.\n\nOf course there is some bad. The UI is atrocious. Tons of bloatware. The launcher also seemed very different from what I was used to, You can pick up pretty much any android phone or tablet and they are all very similar. It feels like Android. This tablet seemed weird. Strange UI and menus, etc... So I just put on Google now launcher and It felt more like an android. There's lots of junk on here that is completely pointless. Nobody is going to use 95% of this junk. So many manufacturers have to put their own spin and software on our devices but this is the worst ive seen. But with a launcher change and disabling some bloat, a few tweaks and you have an amazing device for the price. I already feel better buying this as opposed to the Samsung.\n\nI've only had this a month so I can't speak for long term quality but so far so good. I'm completely impressed. Getting used to the 4:3 aspect ratio too. I still prefer 16:9 by far. Especially for gaming and videos but 4:3 is great for web browsing and reading. This tablet is super light and feels great in your hand. Battery last me 12-13 hours of mixed use on and off all day. Worst I got was 8 hours when I first got it. Installing 2 updates and tons of apps and playing around. Great battery life since for 4000 milliamp battery. Same as Samsung. You really can't beat it for the price. If this thing has long term reliability its probably the best tablet you'll find under $350 and its only 179!!!  Very satisfied, One month in and holding up perfect. No lag, freeze ups etc...And has the knock on/off feature too. It actually works better than my LG's which they were the manufacturer that used it first. Go figure. An absolute steal for $179. Go for it. Feel free to ask any questions."}

While watching netflix, and charging, the percentage went from 30% to 27%.  Similar situation happened while browsing the web and looking at youtube videos.  Even wile changing without using table, it takes about 5 hours to get a full charge.\n* Asus's browser freezes quite often, especially when multi-tabs are opened.  This also happened with Chrome's\n* The OS also freezes from time to time.  While netflix's on and I bring the \"Notification window\", then the freezing begins.  More often than desired I am forced to shut tablet off completely.\n\nI will have it rooted.  Perhaps this will rid some issues, if so, I will be posting a follow up.

But that still hasn't stopped ASUS from trying to make their own version of the best budget tablet. But have they succeeded? Well if they keep updating this thing for a while, then they have definitely created a worthy rival for the Nexus line.\n\n-Design-\n\nI want to start by saying that I love the design of this tablet. Ive yet to see another tablet that is two toned in design. This tablet has a top metal-like frame and a smooth faux leather bottom. According to some reports out there, the whole construction is plastic, but it does feel like metal so for me its good enough to be metal. There is little to no flex in the plastic and the glass feels great. There is some cutouts for the speakers on the front and they look good being where they are. They aren't particularly loud, but the quality of the speaker is pretty good. It is a unique, yet perfectly acceptable design.\n\n-Performance-\n\nThe specs on this device are pretty generous for what they are. This tablet comes packing an Intel Atom Z3530 with a PowerVR G6430 and 2GB of RAM. There is also a space for a microSD card up to 128 GB. What that means in English is that it is really powerful. This tablet zips along with anything that you throw at it. Whether it is a heavy demanding games like Riptide GP or something for work such as a long word document in Microsoft Word this tablet will handle it. ASUS also sells a 4GB version of the same tablet with a slightly more powerful chip for $100 more. But honestly, unless you are running some highly intensive apps simultaneously, I think you will be fine with this version of the tablet. It is powerful enough to meet most peoples needs. Battery life is great, with standby time lasting about 5 to 6 days and screen on time is about 5 to 7 hours, depending on the use. The average user will be satisfied with the performance.\n\n-Display-\n\nThe Zenpad S 8.0 has a beautiful 8 inch (technically 7.9) IPS display of 1536 x 2048; the equivalent of a pixel density of 326 ppi. This is exactly the same specifications of the iPad Mini 4. Quality of the displays are pretty even. You don't get the exact high quality accuracy of the iPad Mini, but nevertheless you still get a high quality screen. Colors are vibrant and the contrast is good. It is also adjustable, meaning that the screen can be adjusted to someones personal preference. Personally, I think the perfect setting (at least for my particular model) is on the default balanced setting with the color temperature a little bit to the warm side. This tends to get rid of the bluish whites that are on this display without messing with the other colors. Overall, I am happy with this display with no noticeable complaints.\n\n-Camera-\n\nSince there is cameras on this thing, I am obligated to review the camera as well. This is one of those areas that ASUS had to cut some corners and Im kind of glad for that sacrifice. I prefer the budget of the tablet to go to the rest of the tablet instead of something that will only be used on occasion. This is still very acceptable for things such as Hangouts and the occasional photos. The rear camera takes decent pictures in great lighting, but dim the lights a bit and the quality takes a giant fall in quality. Even in excellent lighting, the photos come out very grainy and the nighttime mode doesnt even come close to fixing those issues. There is also lag in the viewfinder and lag in taking the photos. If camera is your number one priority, this isn't the device for you. Good for webcam, and that is about it.\n\n-Software-\n\nASUS always loves adding their customization on Android and the Zenpad is no exception. The good thing is that the software does perform smoothly with all the power under the hood. Menu flows smoothly and most apps are useful. Android 5.0 Lollipop works well to keep everything smoothly and most things function like they do in stock lollipop. The aesthetics are something that people would either love or hate. I fall into the latter category. The apps have their own style, but its not something I like. I personally switched to Nova Launcher because I don't like it. But it works well. What doesnt work well is all the bloatware that is added to the tablet. Some apps, like TripAdvisor, might be useful to some people but it is still annoying. Others, such as the Mirror app, are just plain useless. What was wrong with just using the normal camera app? Others, such as the Calendar app, are good, but not great since some of the stock Google apps work better.  Overall, the software performs well on a hardware level, but the design does need some work and some of the bloatware needs to go.\n\n-Conclusion-\n\nI love this tablet. Sure, there are flaws within the software and the camera, but the hardware remains unmatched for the price. The display is beautiful, the hardware is powerful, and the design is unique and appealing. There is also the state of the market right now. Around $199, there are not many tablets and the tablets that are available around that price are not that great. For Android, there is the Samsung Galaxy Tab A (8 inch) with a lower resolution screen, lower internal storage (16GB vs 32GB), weaker speakers, and slower performance. I honestly would not recommend that tablet over this one. Over on the Apple side, there is the iPad Mini 2 which goes for $269. Honestly, if your preference is iOS, the iPad Mini 2 is by far a better choice. But if you love the flexibility of Android, there is no better choice than ASUS. With the NOVA or Google Now launcher, this is the closest thing to a Nexus 7 successor."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "From the time I received this tablet the touch screen function worked intermittently at best.  ASUS support had me go through factory resets and system upgrades with only temporary or partial improvement.  Finally when the problem could not be resolved they said it would need to be returned for repair.  Unlike most reputable manufactures that provide you with a prepaid shipping label, ASUS makes you pay for shipping to their repair facility and then the turn around time is 1-2 weeks plus shipping time.  I would strongly recommend against purchasing anything from ASUS since they clearly don't stand behind their products."}

Updating the firmware, which is very easy to do, solved the problem immediately.\n\n- Uses a C-type connector, so chances are your other Android device cables will not work with it.\n\n- Uploading will drain the battery very quickly. From what other reviews have said, gaming can also drain the battery. (Have not had this problem with streaming, however - the battery can easily get through a feature length film or two).\n\n- Battery will drain fairly quickly overnight, I've found, so it must be recharged daily. As opposed to the Samsung tablet I had before, which could be left overnight and still roughly the same charge the next day.\n\nGOOD\n\n- Specs are insane for this price point.

This has to be the best tablet out there at this price point, and better than many at twice this price.  I did have to exchange my first one when the microphone stopped working, but the Yellow tag store where I bought this exchanged it for me.\n\nFirst, the tablet feels nice in the hand.  The tapered edges make it comfortable to hold, and its light weight enough your hands don't get tired.  The screen is AMAZING.  The colors are bright and vibrant, and the high irresolution display makes text crisp and clear.  It's not the fastest tablet out there, so it might not be the best for gamers, but its powerful enough stream video without issue.  With the MicroSD slot, you can expand the storage so you have plenty of space out there for videos on a long flight.\n\nIt might be worth it for the upgrade to the 64Gb model.  You get double the storage, an extra Gb of RAM, and a faster processor.  That model uses a USB C connector instead of the Micro USB connector the 32Gb, along with most other Android devices use so any existing cables you have would not be able to be used with this tablet.  It does come with the cable, but you may want a spare, or an adapter.  Expect to see USB C on future Android devices.\n\nThe only down side is that this tablet is not waterproof, so don't drop it in a tub of water."}

I am not sure if paint issues can be covered under any warranty since it is not a functionality issue.\n\nInitial Review.\n\nThis is a great tablet and I am very pleased with it, good all around general purpose tablet. However THE Z STYLUS IS TERRIBLE. It is precision is very wishy washy. I would not recommend this tablet for drawing and digital art etc because of the way they implemented the pressure sensitivity technology and the pointer tracking. It is %95 there but that missing the remaining %5 is what matters to people who want to use these digital devices for art. I have no idea why Asus choose not to push the stylus implementation for further precision. The pointer is always a bit laggy behind the pen tip and there is some parallax between the stylus tip and the pointer.\n\nIn all fairness, both the tablet and the stylus are well built. I would recommend the stylus for writing, its precision is much better than other non electronic regular stylus implementations, but it is nothing like a Wacom tablet/pen combo. If you never used a Wacom tablet before then the stylus feel might be pleasing to you.\n\nAnyways, you can still use it for drawings, taking notes etc but I personally think that its precision is lagging behind Samsung tablets with S pens, however the Z stylus offers more pressure sensitivty levels than the Samsung ones I think. I never used a Windows tablet with a pen so I can't comment on such comparison."}

If one never experienced Android before they would be lost. I have another Android tablet and an Android phone and I was confused. For example, the button that should take you to the Apps/Widget (and Settings) screen takes you to something else totally unfamiliar. To get to Settings, you have to swipe UP on the Home screen.\n\nThere is an ASUS app on the tablet that has some FAQs that help, as the ASUS launcher is totally different than what one would expect of a base Android launcher. It would have been nice if in that info booklet, it mentioned to open that app and read the FAQs and some basic instructions.\n\nThe tablet hung up several times to the point where I had to press the on/off button to get going again. I was not doing anything out of the ordinary, in fact I was just getting used to the tablet. I reset the thing back to Factory and started over. Loaded a few apps, ie, Firefox, but no games, and the thing kept randomly hanging again. Apparently others have had this problem. All the s/w had been updated before I started playing with it. Was ready to ship it back to Amazon and take my restock penalty, but since it was the weekend, decided to give it the 3rd try.\n\nReset back to Factory, updated s/w, and uninstalled or disabled just about everything that could be disabled, most (all?) of it Bloatware, and now it seems to work just fine. I have no idea which of the Bloatware(s) was causing the hang problems, and I have no desire to find out.\n\nI am really disappointed that ASUS put all that Bloatware on it. But at least most of it can be uninstalled or Disabled. Otherwise a nice tablet.\nSince I uninstalled and/or disabled just about everything possible, I'm wondering what the next System Update will do or if it will work, or set the System back with all the Bloatware, etc. I'll take a Nand backup just in case or use either the Google or ASUS Cloud backups.\n\nNow that I have it configured and working, I like it as a tablet."}

So, after two or three days trying to fix myself (you know how you do...) it was time to check the internet. Lo and behold, there are updates available. Spend an hour or two, apply updates & things are quite a bit smoother. Well, that's nice -- but who would ship such a dysfunctional tablet to begin with? It should work out of the box, not be a brick in the making.  I expect updates to improve an already functional device, not fix nearly catastrophic existing faults -- which is what these did.\nI then starting getting advertisements that I've not asked for on the lock screen. Hello? Back to the internet. Ah! Asus has loaded crapware that subjects the owner to ads ... without so much as a by your leave, here's what we're going to give you because we love our customers so much!! Easy enough to delete the offending program ... but now every Asus program is suspect, & I should probably spend the next week reviewing them all, figuring out what I really don't need (likely, most of it), & deleting it. I don't have that kind of patience at the moment.\nSo now the tablet, works, mostly, & the obvious crapware is gone. But it still takes the opportunity to simply shut down on a random basis, for no apparent reason. Rebooting, in the middle of use, is a pain.\nI'm tired. A more intelligent consumer would have sent this back after day three. Rising to a challenge isn't always the smartest way to go.\nAfter all that I really can't report on it's functionality: getting to the point of about 80% usability has been sufficiently exhausting that I've concluded two things: I'll never buy another Asus anything again (unless they send someone to demonstrate that they REALLY have found INCREDIBLE, & offer to pay ME to use it); and tablets may not be the answer to my needs.\nPROs: the screen is nice, it seems to be fairly speedy, when it works. Not so much when it doesn't.\nCONs: as noted, but includes the small size of the physical on/of/volume buttons, and the fact that the USB Type C connection port on the tablet is so well concealed that the \"fits any way you want\" feature is moot. You don't have to figure which en is up (as you do with older USB connections ...) but you have to search to find the port. One step forward, one step back.\nCompared to the Samsung (which was hardly perfect), this was an utter failure."}

Quickly swap from app to app. Watched Netflix and Amazon via WiFi and my phone hotspot with no problem.\n\nI bought so I could use with the optional Z-Stylus.  That works great with this, as tried with various apps.  Strongly recommend the stylus with this small screen, especially if you have big fingers like mine. The extra precision of the pointer is very helpful with some apps, and great for drawing or art apps.\n\nMany ASUS-centric apps included, but do not consider them bloatware.  They all offer improved functionality, and with so much extra memory built in, they really have no impact on storage available.\n\nI love the size of this, and find my self using it more then a larger tablet or my phablet Note 3.  At this point in time, I much prefer the Android tablet interface and options superior to my Windows 10 surface pro 3 in tablet mode. (faster input via android keyboard options).\n\nAdded a fast 64 GB card and it works great (not that I need the storage). Also bought a micro c to standard USB3 adapter. (AbleConn). Note-the USBc seems pretty picky, since just handing and adapter on existing OTG cable does not seem to work. Tried it out by plugging in my 2 TB Seagate backup drive.  This also worked great, and I did a complete backup to it.  Caveats, most larger drives are not using  format recognized by Android.  Paragon software makes apps (available on Google Play) which will allow you to get past this OTG roadblovk. Be sure to go into Storage options and eject before unplugging. Also, for the backup drive, mechanical drives use battery pretty quickly, so make sure you are fully charged before starting any big operations."}

Also, after about 10 minutes of using the tablet, (the ZenUI Home screen laucher), the google play store and camera icon were gone from the home screen (ZenUI launcher) and it still is on that specific launcher. Also, after every once in a while, the app I am on would exiback to the home screen and I would get a notification on the screen saying something like \"Unfortunatly Madden Mobile has stopped\" or other apps you have. It would still work after that. I would like the battery life to be better (5 hours). Occasionally, if you are playing a game, the tablet would freeze, and wouldn;t go to the home screen. If you close it, and re-open it, the screen is still frozen and black. But if you restart your ASUS, It should be working fine. Now the good stuff. The tablet is very responsive, and the camera is great (a-lot of modes, including slo-mo, selfie panorama, panorama, beatification, time rewind, time lapse, GIFs. and many useful picture modes to make the camera fit for the picture you are taking.).

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "I purchased this tablet to replace my daughters aging galaxy tab pro 8.0 16gb model. The tab pro was still running fine but the limited storage was causing my daughter to have to delete several apps when she wanted to download something else. So after doing some digging I came across this tablet which is actually cheaper than the tab pro was when I bought it. This tablet is exactly what my daughter needed. It's fast has a clean UI and most importantly 32gb of storage. The only real knock I can give it is all of the bloat ware that Asus puts on their devices. It isn't needed but at least it can be disabled. Battery life is pretty decent for a tablet and I was pleasantly surprised at how well the Intel processor handles task. If you are looking for a decent tablet at a low price then you can't go wrong with this one."}

However, Asus has managed to detract from the experience, as they've done with other products (i.e., 1st gen Zenbook Prime laptop).  Battery life is mediocre at best, which makes sense...at this price point, you'd expect them to cut corners on the hardware somewhere, and admittedly the rest of the hardware is pretty darn good.  'Hearthstone' barely plays, but again, at this price point, I get it.  Where they really messed up though, is with their custom Zen UI and the related apps they bundled in.  This thing is crying, begging for stock Marshmallow Android.  Instead, we get Android 5.0, which is outdated, and their clunky bolted-on UI and apps to complicate the experience and slow things down.  Even after disable their bloat, this thing still lags more than it should.  It's fine, I guess, for the price, but could be so much better with updated and slimmed down software.  Really hoping the developer community works on some custom ROMs for this one soon."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "I have to update my review for a third time because I have new information, just read the second paragraph down, this device has horrible battery life and they have really horrible customer service. I called multiple times to try to resolve an issue, one time a guy said he couldn't hear me, that's probably because I couldn't really here him because of all the sound in his background. Another time a guy was essentially arguing about things that I had already checked and knew it wasn't the problem, also he put me on hold for a very long time and never came back, I stayed because for some reason at this point I was still patient and instead of coming back on the phone it went to a survey, that's how I know that he did it on purpose, he just didn't want to deal with the problem and personally I don't think he cared in the first place.\n\nThe touchscreen is worthless right after you wash your hands. I think it uses the oil in your skin, it doesn''t seem to like clean hands. Also I found the need to reboot sometimes in order to get the touchscreen to work correctly, as some spots on the screen will stop working altogether. ASUS packs this with a lot of software that I think many people will never use. Also, The camera has no flash??? Come on ASUS, why not add flash? On the keypad the space bar is to close to the home button and it is very easy to end up on the home screen. I found it easier to type on my iPod touch (6th generation) then this. Then the power button is way too sensitive, so it is easy to turn off the tablet by mistake.\n\nThe software Asus bundles, reminds me of some of the worst pre-installed bloatware on a cheap laptop. I found two issues with the hardware, many more with the software. The technical flaw I mentioned above is that the ZenPad is prone to overheating if the CPU is heavily used for 20 minutes or so. Although the tablet does not feel overly warm to the touch, it starts throttling. This leads to lagging and stuttering. I found this behavior most often during video games, although video playback where the tablet needed to do on-the-fly transcoding caused the problem as well. Running benchmarking software caused the problem after 17-18 minutes. The plastic shell is not as durable as the metal shell of an iPad. The ZenPad shows noticeable wear and scratches to the edges after a couple weeks' use.\n\nAsus fell prey to the desire to distinguish their offering from stock Android. Their software choices needlessly complicate common choices, the settings are a real mess and add complexity to what is a simple task in stock Android. The majority of the software is pure bloatware offering little more than battery-sapping processes that can't be uninstalled. The worst \"features\", however, are Asus' own doing. Enabled by default is software that promises to smooth video playback. Watch a movie and you'll see weird transitions inserted between video frames. Two settings that cannot be disabled are aggressive sharpening and an auto contrast algorithm for images. The sharpening makes on-screen text blurry and UI elements unclear in web pages. For images, it creates obvious artifacts. The auto contrast adjusts all images whether they need it or not. This makes the Z580CA less than useful for image review or presentations.\n\nIf you don't absolutely require the extra memory and are not wedded to Android, the 16GB iPad Mini 2 costs the same, is nearly as fast, has better colors, and you don't need to deal with the mess Asus made of the Android UI or the bundled bloatware."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "I have had this system for a few days and am quite happy with it. Disclaimer: I bought this at a big box store.\nWhat I don't like:\nZenUI. I find the Zen UI more confusing than the native Google interface on the Google tablet such as the Nexus 7 2013. I will give it a little more time before going back to Google Launcher.\nBloatware. There is much bloatware, but some is useful, so I will take my time weeding it out.\nOnly Lollipop 5.0. I am also disappointed that the tablet seems stuck on Lollipop 5.0, even though Asus has released 3 System Updates of their own since the tablet was released.\nShort Charger Cable. The charger cable is too short and I had hoped it would be USB C rather than the USB mini. Oh well, I have plenty of USB mini cables if I need a longer cable.\nThe headphone jack. I am not sure how it will hold up under heavy use.\nWhat I do like:\nThe screen. 1536 x2048. Excellent detail. The reviews report the color is not accurate, but Asus gives you utilities to customize the color.\nThe form factor. I am not a video person, but use this for browsing and reading, so this form factor of 4 x3 instead of 16 x 9 as on the Nexus 72013 works better for me. Web pages, pdfs load with the dimensions I like.\nThe sound. There is Little bass, but what sound you do hear is clear and not tinny. Headphones or external speakers can always supply the bass. The speakers are located on each side (landscape mode) and are front facing.\nWireless: It does not have AC but It is working well and steady with N at my house.\nBluetooth. The tablet recognized both my Bluetooth speakers, and the Asus supports AptX.\nThe battery. Seems to be holding up well for me. But I had hoped Asus would implement quick charging.\nIt is very light and balanced. I can hold this up with one hand for a while without getting fatigued.\nIt is fast enough. It played the videos, loaded the web pages I wanted to load quickly.\nDecent RAM and Ample storage. 2GM RAM/ 32 GB storage is as good as it gets at this price. Also, you can add up to 128GB storage via a mini SD card that you can install on the side, without opening the case.\nThe price: This is great value at 200. And I got it for much less during  a flash sale.\nConcern: I have little confidence that Asus will ever update this to Marshmellow, and I am not sure of Lollipop 5.1. It is not as future proof as I would like.\nRecommendation: I have recommended it to family already. And it you need it now, its worth the buy. However, this unit has already been out for 7 months. So the inevitable replacement that has a later OS will be out there at some point, sooner than later. Therefore, waiting is also a very viable option.\n\nUpdate October 2nd, 2016. Asus has made the 6.0.1 Marshmallow image available from Asus support. I have installed this and everything seems to be working."}

What's good about USB C? Nothing. Most of the cables and chargers on the market don't confirm to standards and those that claim to meet standards don't work. It's not fast and difficult to find working OTG adapters. Be prepared to pay plenty for junk.\n*No support. It's difficult to gage the contempt the CEO of Asus must feel for  his own employees as he sets them up as perfect fools. The people you call know nothing about the tablet and will tell you astounding whoppers. Reset your tablet or return it to where you bought it, that's about it.\n*Better know what you're doing as there's no forum and no help. Asus won't escalate your problem because there is no tech support.\n*There are no Android updates. It comes with Android 5.0 and six months after release appears to have reached end of life.  There are occasional Zenui updates, which nobody wants.\n*The screen is sluggish and not as responsive as the Nexus 7 2013. It's difficult to select text so I use it more as a media tablet.\n*What's good about Zenui? Nothing. A mountain of bloatware\n*Given Google drift, shelf life might not be terrible but it's pretty shocking to be abandoned at the six month mark.\n\n  I might add that I have two Asus tablets: the Nexus 7 2013 supported by Google and the Zenpad 580ca, not supported by Asus. I purchased the Nexus 7 2013 on July 26, 2013 and have received EVERY Android update. Additionally I receive a security update EVERY month, patching known flaws. How many Android updates from Asus since August of 2015 for the Zenpad 580ca?  That would be zero. How many security updates since August of 2015? That would also be zero.\n\n  As of April 30, 2016, there have been no updates for Zenui since December of 2015. It hardly matters as Zenui is designed for their watches and phones--most of their \"apps\" don't work on the tablet.\n\n  It's hard to recommend a company with such a lack of support--the Comcast of the tech world."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "This tablet looks awesome on paper, which is why I bought it (I bought the 64 GB storage Wifi version.) Unfortunately, it has some severe issues. First, there are a lot of pre-loaded that cannot be turned off (in some cases) and hog resources. For example, my 3-year-old son loves a simple game called Botanicula. It didn't run nearly as well on this as my old Nexus 7, which on paper is very inferior to the Zenpad S 8. Secondly, it comes running Android OS 5.0. I didn't think that would be an issue, but it turns out the this OS has some severe battery drain issues that crop up over time. After 2 weeks, I was losing up to 7% of battery in 10 minutes during use! That was even with some things turned off, like wifi, auto syncing, etc.  and battery saving features being used... crazy. Doing a hard reset fixed the problem until you started to use it again, and then it would get bad quickly. I have read that this was common with Android 5.0. The really bad news is that ASUS has given no indication that they will release an updated OS for this tablet."}

Tablet pauses so much about 25% of the time is spending buffering.\n\nUPDATE A YR LATER 7/12/16  The same issues as before.  I bought a new router.  At this moment I'm sitting about 6 ft from the router.  The 3 yr kindle fire is playing shows just fine.  The ASUS is pausing and stopping constantly.  While playing the same show on both devices,  on the kindle it's at 36 mins, the ASUS 22 mins.\n\nUpdate 12/12/17  noted issues never resolved, I would just download anything I wanted to watch, so download, watch , erase and repeat.

Kept saying to restart app.  While looking here and there, I checked storage.  I had barely any space left on tablet memory.  I moved as much as I could to the SD card, but the issue still occurred.  Looking again at storage, I notice something called \"cached date\",  had about 7 GB.  I cleared.  It seems to do the trick.  With more memory available, the kids games started working again.

One downside I have to mention is that there is quite a lot of bloatware apps that seem to come standard with Asus products. Some of them are useful if you give them a chance but most you won't ever need.

It also is pretty fast no lag to speak of and what I liked too was the fact it has two front facing speakers so it sounds good I don't know why all tablets don't have this feature it is also very thin and very light it's almost too light I would definitely recommend this tablet to anyone looking for a portable tablet who actually wants to get more than what you expect for the money you spend."}

Turns out you can't, because every time you charge it, you can't use the screen. Maybe I got a defective one. That being said, the deal should include a stylus.. Also, the magnetic link on the protective cover works to flip your tablet to sleep. however it does this whether the flap is on top in the closed position (the way it's supposed too) or tucked neatly behind the tablet for ease of holding (which it's not supposed too)... so that sucks.

The bloatware is annoying but most can be removed. However one major issue forced me to return this tablet after trying a replacement.\n\nThe wi-fi strength is mediocre. In the room of my house that I would typically use the tablet I never received excellent signal strength and found it to rapidly fluctuate between good and poor. This resulted in buffering issues for all streaming apps I attempted to use, the main reason I purchased this tablet. In the same room my Xperia Z3 and PC (using a Netis WF2118 PCI adapter) both consistently have good to excellent signal. I gave the ZenPad another shot by getting a replacement because it has so much going for it, but the wi-fi issue persisted. A wi-fi extender might have solved the issue, however since my other devices work well in the same area, I couldn't justify doing taking that route.\n\nMaybe I had two duds, maybe it is just a software issue that will be fixed in the future, but the fact is I had two ZenPads that had inferior wi-fi capabilities.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "This review is for the 32GB version.\n\nIn my opinion this tablet is the all-around best value currently in the 8 inch Android category.\nIts not perfect though and I ended up returning it and getting another (more costly) device.\nI still give it a huge thumbs-up as the majority of users will likely not be bothered by what I consider it's downsides.\n\nJust to provide a little background  about me, this was my 9th Android tablet purchased. I've owned (or still own) the following tablets:\n\nAcer A700\nGalaxy Tab 7\nAsus TF101 10.1\nGoogle Nexus 10\nKindle Fire 8.9 HDX\nSamsung Tab S 10.5\nGoogle Nexus 7 2012\nGoogle Nexus 7 2013\n\nI purchased the Asus to use as a out-and-about device as carrying around the Samsung Tab S was getting tiresome. I did tons of research and chose the Asus due to it's low price + display quality + performance. Here's a breakdown of pros/cons based on my (admittedly short) time with the device:\n\nPROS:\n\nThis tablet has an incredible display when you take cost ($200) and technology (IPS TFT) into account. It compared very favorable to the AMOLED display on my Tab S at equal brightness. With that said brightness of the Tab S at - 60% was equal to the Asus at 100% which is due to the different display technologies.\nColors were rich without being over saturated and viewing angles were great, as you would expect for an IPS display.\n\nOverall design and quality are good to excellent with dual front-facing speakers (which should be standard on EVERY tablet IMHO) and a solid feeling, well-built chassis.\n\nPerformance was great with no slowdowns or stuttering. Apps opened quickly and the Asus UI seemed well-thought-out and surprisingly useful. I didn't use it for long though as I always run a custom launcher like Nova Pro.\n\nMy favorite feature of the tablet (after the display and speakers) is the knock-on/knock-off feature. This functionality is on my LG G3 phone and is a lot more useful than youd expect, and is another feature that I think should be standard on tablets.\n\nCONS:\n\nThe device is slippery in my hands due to the brushed finish plastic used on 80% of the tablets back. The texture feels nice to the touch but doesn't provide much grip. A leather/rubber like strip runs along the lower portion (if held in landscape orientation) of the back that does provide good grip when held in portrait. As I typically hold my tablets in ladscape I felt like I was going to drop it constantly. Others may be OK with this though. I dropped  star for this as it's pretty subjective.\n\nThe tablet ships with Android lollipop 5.0.2 instead of 5.1.1 and Asus isn't really known for speedy Android version updates. I was hopeful that an update to 5.1.1 was in the works but sadly there's no word from Asus as I write this review. This only lost it another  star as I knew of this before purchasing.\n\nThe biggest con for me was lack of 5ghz wifi support. I use 5ghz almost exclusively on my devices as there's a ton of active 2.4ghz routers in range of my house. I also get anywhere from 3 - 4 times the speed on the 5ghz band vs the 2.4ghz band. This was listed in the specs for this device but I just (incorrectly) assumed that any new device would have 5ghz functionality. I deducted  star for this.\n\n(NOTE: the 64GB version does have 5ghz wifi, but at $300 it's not as much of a steal as the 32GB version is.)\n\nIf you only have - $200 to spend - and can live with with the few cons mentioned - this tablet is a no-brainer.\n\nDISCLAIMER: I was given a few (small) gift cards by relatives for Christmas from a local big box store that brought the out-of-pocket cost down. As a result I did not purchase this tablet from Amazon."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "Just an update that ASUS has decided to abandon this \"flagship\" tablet.  There will be no android updates, limiting the lifespan and usefulness of this device.  If you do buy an Android device, look for ones branded by Google or even Samsung does a much better job at keeping their devices updated.\n\n***See update after the initial poor review.\n\nPoorly constructed.  Unable to charge the 64GB USB-C version.  The USB plug for USB is supposed to click in and be very secure.  Not the case with the device.  Touching the cable caused charging to stop.  There is a ton of wiggle in the USB cable.  It is going back to Amazon for a refund.  Unhappy that I'm stuck with cases and screen protectors for a device I'm sending back.\n\n***Update: I sent it back and received a replacement and the replacement is perfect.  The prior one that I purchased was from Amazon Warehouse Deals and while it said that only the packaging was damaged, I can confirm that the contents were not in new condition.  The new replacement that I ordered had the tablet itself wrapped with a cigarette-wrap style polywrap.  The original had a sort of shrink wrap on the screen.  The original had not been thoroughly tested and oddly arrived with the battery fully depleted.  The replacement was at about 60% which is typical of lithium batteries in a new device.\n\nVery powerful and though I have an iPad Air 2, my kids use it most of the time, so I figured I'd try something different. The bloatware doesn't really bother me because there's plenty of space on the 64GB version and tons of RAM.\n\nUpdate #2: Bad battery?  Can't even get through 2 hours of watching a movie before dying. Also audio cuts out intermittently on headphones with my Bose headphones. They work fine on my iPhone. Sending back and hopefully #3 is the charm.  :-/\n\nUpdate #3: the last replacement works great.  Good battery life and no audio dropping on headphones."}

But it's loaded with unnecessary programs, the on button has to pressed for several seconds and even then I'm not sure if it's turning on, and it goes to black quickly even though I reset the timeout settings.  The navigation is confusing, with three screens, some repetitive, and it's not clear which screen you always want. It's not obvious how to get to Settings - I have to search for it and am not sure how to add a shortcut - no drag and drop.  File Manager is very confusing with no directions.

While streaming movies in netflix has those black lines, i can live with it.\nCons:\nIts apps.. I know it doesnt get updates much.. which i can live by but the bloat wares are terrible. I disabled few but they still show and i wanted to enable them and i couldnt. The tech support said i might have to reset it. I don't want to . But it still works with out it.\n\nOverall: FOr the price it is an awesome device. Now a days, the OS keeps updating and at a point the device hardware cant handle them so we need a new device. So i bought this one and i am liking it. I want to use it for at least 2 years and 4 if possible and i think this possible. Just get the 64GB memory slot and this is a really nice tablet."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "TL:DR - This is be far the best bang for the buck tablet in the Jan 2016 season. Probably longer. Buy.\n\nFor everyone else who wants to read a review and make a smarter choice....\n\nThis is my first tablet, so if you have any questions about what I said, or want to point out how much of a fool I am, feel free.\n\nI bought the Z580CA because the processor is much faster 2.3Ghz  vs the Z580C's  1.3Ghz  Having 4 gigs of ram and 64gig internal storage where also big factors in my choice. I wanted my tablet to be as future-proof as possible and the trifecta of 2.3Ghz, 4 gigs ram and 64 gig storage seemed like it would fit this bill.\n\nIt's sale price at the time of $250 made it very attractive. Looking at other units in the same price range I was disappointed, few others had as much processor speed or amount of ram. Ones that did came in the $800+ range.  While I liked them, I made the choice as a computer savvy person who just wanted to experience a tablet, to pick the ASUS. The bang for your buck factor was too good to miss, and even compared to higher end Microsoft, Apple or Samsung units, it's not missing anything. Mostly just folios, skins and cases. Some proprietary things as well, but I think we all know NONE of that stuff is essential to functionality or style. This tablet is better in specs than almost all big name tablets and costs much less.  If you don't care about the branding but do care about performance, this is a stellar choice!\n\nIt comes with Android 5.0  but also an ASUS custom UI,  its been updated 3 times since I got it on the 19th of December so this does not appear to be an issue.  I found it very easy to customize my UI anyway with limitless options. Some apps in the store said that my device is unsupported but I think that has more to do with it not being a phone and some older apps too.\n\nI tried to stress test this as best I could. I ran my Sirius radio stream, a youtube video, Card Wars -game- Gin Rummy, Crome, and my Fallout 4 PipBoy apps all at once and experienced no dip in performance.\n\nBuild quality seems great. It feels good in my hand, and the section of soft touch faux leather makes it fairly slip resistant and also much warmer than the metal back -New England winters- The metal backing feels great and very solid too, and its patterned surface is very hansom. The front glass feels very solidly placed and the screen stays shockingly fingerprint free. I don't have much experience with them since they gross me out, but I am pleased how well the screen holds up. I can always see little dots under the screen where the contact points intersect under the glass, they flicker at times. As a first time owner of touchscreens I don't know if this is normal or not, but it does not bother me enough to try and return it. Too much hassle. I deduct one star for this,  but only because I can't take only half.\n\nDisplay quality is astounding. Videos are so crisp, I don't use my 1080p 50\" tv anymore! Games play very well, the ones I've tried anyway.  Not sure what constitutes good gaming performance or even high end tablet games at this point. I will update when I study up more, or ask me directly and I will try it on the spot for you if desired.\n\nThe volume and power buttons are raised and easy to find. They don't feel lose, but not super solid either, but have a satisfying clicking feel when depressed. Power also has a slight knob on it to help distinguish itself.\n\nThis unit has an 8MP rear facing camera and a 5MP front facing.  Works well with skype, person I skyped said it was clear in picture and sound quality on her end. Same on my end. Cameras function well, can't see myself using them for anything other than novelty at best. The speakers are nice and loud, a bit tinny, but its a tablet, buy some headphones if you cant deal.\n\nThere is a specialty stylus made by ASUS just for this tablet, but was out of stock when I ordered and seems to still be the case as of 1/9/16 I want to try to draw with this when I finally get my hands on it. Its supposed to have special features exclusive to each other, but I don't know how much I buy into that.\n\nI like the USB-C connection. No fooling around with which side is up, it just sockets every time. Battery life gets me through a day of surfing with screen dimmed all the way. Realistically I get about 4-6 hours depending on apps. Charging from fully dead is just about 3 hours but topping it off takes barely any time at all.\n\nI should update this as I get more familiar with the machine. I like it so far.  Sorry for the long winded review, I like to cover as many bases and maybe it helps someone make an informed decision."}

The display on this is high resolution but the viewing angle sucks and the color gamut is lower than competing tablets. Also since this is an Intel x86 tablet some Android apps like Comcast's Xfinity, TVGo, and various other apps won't work as of now. The ASUS skin is also very distractive. I'd recommend you install the Google Now launcher and another lockscreen to get rid of the ASUS stuff.\n\nWARNING: When the battery is completely depleted, you must press the volume down and the power button simultaneously to enter recovery mode and reboot from there. Otherwise, it would just be stuck on the battery screen and won't boot into android.\n\nUPDATE: So the tablet has completely died on me and it won't take a charge anymore, using the included or other charging bricks. (The charging brick works with other devices) and the trick above no longer works. I am completely disappointed in this product. Their tech support is also not helpful. Applying for an RMA now.

The primary reason I bought the Z580C was to stream movies /TV and play occasional low end games like Star Wars Commander.

Plus, if you read the Fire HD 10 uses a \"MediaTek Quad-Core: 2 @ 1.5 GHz + 2 @ 1.2 GHz\"  which is not a true Quad Core.  It is what they state as load balancing chips which performance is horrible. This tablet blows the Fire HD 10 away in more than one way which includes using a true Quad Core Intel Atom Chipset.\n\nThe only con for me is that the Dish Anywhere App isn't compatible with this Tablet as of the time of writing this review.

After my experience with the Asus ZenPad, I'm not exactly sure why anyone would ever even buy a tablet at this point in their development. I guess I wanted something bigger than my phone to watch movies and surf the net. This thing just felt awkward to hold, though. Oh, yeah, there's not really any quality accessories available for this tablet. Bummer. I sent it back after three days, and cut my losses. If you already have a nice phone, skip this tablet. The experience won't be any better. While the Asus ZenPad is very thin, and light, it feels cheap and built for the budget consumer. For a hundred bucks I might have kept this one. It wasn't all bad, but certainly not worth three-hundred bucks. Sorry Asus, you'll have to go back to the drawing board if you want to compete with the higher end brands."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "Have been using it for almost a month and in a few words, this tablet has satisfied all my expectations. I bought it (4gb ram version) as a replacement for my old Nexus 7 2012, which with the latest Lollipop installment, has become very laggy, almost unusable and I'm not even a power user. I use the tablet mostly for checking social networks such as Facebook and Instagram, watch 9gag, YouTube videos occasionally and use the browser to make a quick search or read something while laying in the bed.\nThe stronger point on this tablet is without doubt the performance. It surprised me how snappy the performance has been. Especially browsing with Chrome which its smoothness is comparable with an experience that I had using an iPad 2. Everything load very quickly and without any hiccup.\nThe 4:3 aspect ratio, for my purposes, is very much welcome. I liked better than the 16:9 of the Nexus 7. Probably because I'm not used to watch a lot of videos with the tablet.\nThe thinness of this tablet is another plus along with how lightweight it is. Adding the 8\" inch display, the size is still very comfortable to use with only one hand, and even with a cover, I'm find it very manageable.\nThe quad HD display is gorgeous. It is not ground breaking in comparison with other tablets of 2015, but is due to the fact that I'm coming from the Nexus 7 2012 and I was satisfied with the quality of its display.\nThe main cons that I found on this tablet are the bloatware and the battery performance. As mentioned on almost every review that I have read of it, the amount of bloatware is absurd, especially for someone like me where the ideal Android experience is vanilla Android, having only minimum apps necessary to run. Half of the apps that came preinstalled, cannot be uninstalled, but disabled only. The 64 Gb of internal storage helps to overcome the space taken by these apps and 4 Gb ram to keep the snappy performance even with all these bloatware running in background (some are system apps and cannot even be disabled). The battery life is below average in comparison with my Nexus 7 2012 and my brother's Nexus 7 2013. As I said, I'm not a power user and even in moderate use, I have to charge it once every 2 days whereas with the Nexus 7 and same usage, I would last up to even 4 days with the same charge. However, this is not a major inconvenience for me as I use the tablet indoors 99% of the time.\nThere are the main points that I wanted to highlight about this tablet. In overall, a great buy. 300$ well spend. If the main feature you are looking is ab buttery smooth performance, this tablet is well worth it. On the other hand, if a vanilla android experience and capability of adding customs ROMs is a must, I would suggest to look elsewhere."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "Purchased the 64GB/4GB RAM (Z580CA) as a Christmas gift for my better half. This tablet competes against the iPad mini in my opinion and it's been impressive so far. Battery life has lasted a whole day but we're not heavy users. This is used to check emails, Facebook, YouTube, some light gaming, Kindle books and some times Netflix. Haven't really needed to charge it till later in the evening but that's at 30% left of battery life.\nFor the price you're getting a lot of bang for your buck with some trade offs like the battery not being that big. There is a good amount of bloat ware but you can remove or disable them. You're also not getting the top of the line Snapdragon processor but the Intel Quad-core in this seems to be fast enough.\nThe display is 2k and videos look sharp. Have not had any issues with touch sensitivity either. Sound is loud enough with two front facing speakers. The 8mp main camera is okay as is the front camera. Not the greatest but what did you expect from a $300 tablet, they had to cut corners somewhere. Current OS is Lollipop and it seems to be just fine. Will update this review when Asus updates the OS.\nAll in all, this is a great tablet for $300 and I would suggest it in a heartbeat to anybody who is on a tight budget. Forgot to mention you can expand the memory with a microsd cars up to 128gb."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "After a few months using this tablet, I feel like I can finally make a comprehensive review.\n\nSpeed:\nI was initially lured by the price, but worried that the speed would disappoint me.\nWhile it was a bit slow when I first got it (a week or two after it came out), but as I removed a good amount of bloatware (a lot of ASUS stuff comes pre-installed) and they made software updates, the tablet sped up and now it is very fast. I don't notice it loading anything really.\n\nDisplay:\nDisplay looks great, the 4:3 resolution does not really bother me because I mainly use the book to read textbooks.\nWhen I do watch videos or Netflix there is a slight lack of sharpness, this is probably due to the apps themselves and not the tablet because all the browsers have very sharp images.\n\nAccessibility:\nPeople who like android would love this tablet, it's customizable and has plenty of room upfront to customize the home screen as you wish.\nOlder, less technologically inclined people might find it a little bit harder to use than an iPad but that can be curbed with simple explanation of how to use the device.\n\nMemory:\nThe file manager that ASUS had recently updated is actually pretty great.\n32GB of built in storage and a micro SD card slot means it has plenty of storage for photos, textbooks, apps, but maybe not movies.\n\nBattery:\nBattery lasts a long time when reading and watching videos.\nFor consideration:\nNetflix takes about 1% per 5 minutes of video\nCharging is a little bit slow, could benefit from the charging case.\nA charge usually lasts me 2-3 days of somewhat regular use before having to recharge.\n\nOverall:\nI originally got this tablet to use to view my textbooks and it does that fantastically.\nThe amount of bloatware it comes with and the below average charging speeds are the only drawback with this tablet, but it is very easy to remove the bloatware and the battery itself lasts a long time.\n\nI give this tablet a 9.5/10 and I think it is the best tablet you can get for under $200"}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "OK one major issue... Clash of Clans is what I would call a turn-based game.  Each turn (attacking) requires probably 120 touches on the touch screen.  The Z580CA loses 4-5 of those touches on a pretty regular basis.  So you drop a heal spell, move on to the next piece of your attack, and then notice 10 seconds later that the heal spell never happened.  If you are on Clash, you know this is a deal-breaker.  I have updated the firmware to WW4.5 using the tools and instructions from Asus web site.\n\nMy video demonstrating the issue:\nhttps://youtu.be/uwJRHTzp1F0\n\nI've been on Clash of Clans daily for over two years using a Nexus 7 2013.  Never experienced the same issue with that older tablet.\n\nI truly hope Asus corrects the issue with a firmware update.  I WANT this tab to succeed.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "This is about the 10th tablet in the household. No, those are not all mine but I've had about 4 in my hands. This was an Xmas gift for my son, an upgrade from his samsung galaxy tab 3 8. Lemme just first say that I am staying clear of samsung products. Even though they put a reasonable quality product on the market I think they're overpriced for what u get. It's loaded with bloat and model after model, u don't get a lot of hardware improvements. Tablets that are made today still have a similar screen as my son's old samsung. Now, onto the asus tablet.\n\nI have to say that the first impressions were very good. I loved the screen. I agree with some people that it doesn't seem to get overly bright but I don't think that would be an issue. Max brightness isn't too bright like so many other tablets.\n\nThe tablet is fast. Loading the same program on my son's old samsung and this new asus wasn't even fair. The asus was faster in every aspect. Smoother, way better screen and just ran everything faster.\n\nThere is quite a bit of bloatware and that's annoying but to be honest, I don't think u can get away from that unless maybe u get a nexus tablet. What I do like though, for all the bloat, you can use one of the programs to stop programs from starting and draining Ur battery. I was even able to uninstall some too. I read some reviews that said u couldn't and maybe I haven't come across the programs that u can't Uninstall yet but so far, it's been fine. I've been able to Uninstall what I want.\n\nWe played some Madden NFL mobile and hitman sniper today... Got many many hrs of play out of it. Can't say how much exactly but we started playing around 1 and with breaks in there, the tablet died at about 10. I'd say not bad for continuous usage on a pretty good program that probably has high graphics demands.\n\nThe 2 things I found annoying were the double tap to sleep function. I think it put the tablet to sleep when I double tapped in the middle of a game. Annoying so I had to turn that off. The other thing that was annoying was that during hitman sniper, the screen would turn off for a few seconds and then turn back on. It never lost the game but it was questionable when the screen went dark.\n\nI'll update as I figure more things out but after the first day, very happy with the tablet. Except for the above mentioned issue that I haven't figured out yet. But my son is happy with it so I'm happy.\n\nMy list of tablets\nSamsung Galaxy tab 7 plus\nAmazon Kindle Fire hd 8.9 (original)\nAsus memopad... Forgot which model. About 2 yrs old.\nLenovo yoga tablet 2 (current)\n\nMy son has owned\nArchos 80 g9\nSamsung Galaxy tab 3 8.0\nNow the asus zenpad s 8.0\n\nI've had a lot of tablets and a lot of different phones and I've rooted a lot of them to make them work the way I want them to. I'm thinking I won't have to do that to this asus tablet. It's early so we'll see but it's looking good so far.\n\nUpdate. It's been a week and while the tablet rocks when it's working, the screen issue still happens. I've been able to either disable or Uninstall most of the asus bloat that I don't want. This includes a lot of the display modifying apps which I personally find to be a nuisance more than anything. With all that I've done,  I've been able to minimize this screen off problem but it hasn't gone away. I'm starting to think I may have received a dud. My son watched a movie and the screen turned off maybe 3 times but while the screen is off, u can still hear everything. So it's still running in the background but the screen just turns off. So, the search continues to find the solution why this one problem keeps happening. Other than this one problem, the tablet is really nice. I thoroughly enjoy it. More so, my son is enjoying it even though he's having the screen issue. I'm downgrading to 4 stars because of this.\n\nThe positives are still there. I've never been super picky about battery life as long as u don't drain a ton on standby when I'm doing nothing and as long as I get about 6 hrs plus play time. If it gives me that, I'm good. I think this zenpad does give me more than the 6 hrs. I say I but I really mean my son. I mess with it a bit but he spends most of the time on it. The speed and the performance has been very nice. Things are smooth and load fast. Lotsa ram which is also great. Lotsa storage too. My son almost filled up his galaxy tab. Both internal and SD card so having a big internal memory to go with the 64gb micro SD card is awesome. It supports more but that's his old chip and I'm not getting another one yet.\n\nStill, I'm Pleased overall and will be very happy if I can figure out this screen issue. I'd root it except I don't know that will fix the issue.\n\nUpdate:  So, I figured it out about a week ago after looking at all the programs on the tablet. I Cleaned it out the best I could and it was still an intermittent problem. Then I realized it might have been the case. Tested it and sure enough, it was the case. After this I took steps to make sure that the case wouldn't be folded back when the tablet is in use. It's a minor annoyance having to do this with the case but the problem is solved and I'm good with everything now. I've upgraded my rating to 5 stars.\n\nI did submit a ticket to asus customer service and it took about a week for them to respond. Not much help with the response but at least they responded. I'll keep an eye out for this problem to make sure I was right but I'm pretty sure it's been solved."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "I bought this tablet in December of last year - the specs looked good on paper, so is the price, and I was hoping for a good (yea, right...) software support from Asus down the road.\n\nAfter using it for a long enough time - here are my short impressions for this specific (64GB) model:\n- Display is pretty good, good backlight uniformity, good resolution and color reproduction. That's basically it when it comes to \"positive\" aspects.\n\nNow the bad things:\n- Yes, it has front-facing stereo speakers, however the audio quality is pretty mediocre, even when using various built-in EQ settings, and the loudness does not go loud enough, which is pretty bad if you're trying to watch some streaming movie with someone else watching something with loud sound in next room.\n- Battery life is pretty mediocre as well, the max I've gotten from it was about 4 hours of watching videos, from a full charge, but it usually lasts less than that especially if you try to play any kind of graphics-intensive games. The standby drain (when the tablet is not connected to the charger) is also pretty bad.\n- Since it's not a very popular model there are basically no good quality accessories available for it (I've tried a couple of flip covers for it made by some generic Asian companies, both had various issues).\n- Last, but most important: it is STILL STUCK ON ANDROID 5.0 (only software updates ever released for it were the security patches) and Asus has not mentioned any future plans for MM or any other Android version updates. This alone has a great negative impact on this tablet's performance (even with 4GB of RAM it feels pretty sluggish for some apps), battery life (especially the standby drain) as well as ability to run certain apps, and this is enough of a reason for anyone to completely avoid this thing. I don't know the reason for lack of Android version updates (perhaps it's because the Intel has abandoned plans for any future processors for mobile devices and software support for current ones or perhaps Asus' own software engineers are just extremely lazy), all I know is that will be my last Asus mobile device and I highly recommend for anyone to consider tablets made by other manufacturers before wasting money on this outdated model."}

The screen is very crisp while watching video or reading comics, just be sure to disable ASUS's video performance setting in the display options and set the color to neutral. The 4:3 aspect ratio is surprisingly nice for everyday use. Most video content is 16:9 so you do get significant letterboxing, but the size is just right so that's not really a problem. My biggest complaint is with the bloatware ASUS ships with it. There are many apps that cannot be uninstalled and pester you about permissions and updates. ASUS is also a bit lazy about getting system updates out. if you're someone who can and will install aftermarket ROM's on your android devices I'd highly recommend it if a stable one is available.\n\nOverall it's a good buy, though if I was in the market now I'd probably buy the new Nvidia Shield Tablet."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "I just got this tablet on Monday, so my review reflects my experience thus far.\n\nI'm coming off of a Nexus 7 (2013), and I have to say, I still think I liked the Nexus more. It just had the best out of box experience, no having to remove all the bloatware that Asus seems to throw on their devices. But alas, there is no new Nexus 7 or 8 on the horizon, so I went with this one.\n\nThe Zenpad S is a nice tablet. It's snappy, it runs well (although I've had one particular app crash fairly often, not sure if it's the app or the device itself), it feels great in my hand, the colors are nice. I have two complaints, which is what is keeping me from rating this five stars- the aforementioned bloatware, and the screen brightness. With the Nexus, I never had to think about adjusting the brightness at all. I set it to automatic and forgot about it. With the Zenpad it's either way too bright or WAY too dim on auto, so I have to adjust it myself.\n\nNow, the bloatware. Why, oh why, do companies like to stick us with so many apps or programs that we'll never use, and will have a very hard time getting rid of? I spent a couple of hours the first day removing and disabling things. I know, the companies partner up to keep the cost of the tablet down, but I'm sure I'm not the only person who would have gladly paid another 50 bucks to get this tablet without all the bloat.\n\nAs I'm thinking about it, I guess I do have one more complaint, and that's the Android version this ships with- Lollipop 5.0. Not 5.1 or Marshmallow. I don't understand why a brand new tablet ships out with a year old version of the OS, and no word at all on when an android update might be coming.\n\nIf I could give half stars, this would probably get a three and a half from me, but since it DOES seem to run very well, as advertised, I'll go ahead and give it the bump, although I reserve the chance to come back and update this review if things go downhill."}

Perhaps it is more noticeable on the version that's priced at $199 which has a bit weaker specs.  People complain about problems with it dimming and critics claim the screen isn't as brightly colored as other tablets.  Honestly, I haven't noticed either and I play plenty of high-graphic games on it such as Wolf Among Us and Walking Dead.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "I was so excited to try this tablet out for a few reasons.  The screen resolution and that I could (mistakenly) use their new Z Stylus with it.  I was also curious about trying a 4x3 sized screen as I've only used the 16x9 ones.  There were problems with each of those things among others.  Including getting multiple \"google play services has stopped\" errors!!!  It probably happened 3 times a day.  Not cool.  The only great thing about this tablet was the sound.  The DTS front facing speakers had the best sound of any tablet I've used.  It sounded great.  The screen resolution was great for viewing photos, but it made the text very small and setting a larger text wouldn't work in all apps.  If a webpage had mixed sizes of font (which I realized they all seem to) then it was a nightmare to get it so the tiny text was readable without the larger text being huge.  Speaking of the screen... It's so so dim.  You have to crank it way up around 70% to get the brightness that all my phones and past tablets have when set to around 30%.  The screen was beautiful when the brightness was set high, but I know that'd cut my battery time way down.  The 4x3 size was very awkward, hurt my hand when I held it in bed, and since the 8 inches was measured on a 4x3 instead of a 16x9 it made the tablet look tiny.  Way smaller than I was picturing it.  I was totally disappointed at that point and the google play services stopping was a concern, but I would have overlooked all of that because I'm using this for my art, so I thought I'd wait until I got my stylus from Asus before making a decision.\n\nAs I was reading some reviews while waiting for it to arrive I realized that the Z Stylus didn't work with my version of the tablet.  You'll never believe this.. when you put this tablet in the cart on the ASUS webpage it shows the stylus (and a cover) as \"Suggested Add-Ons\".  The only thing is that their brand new awesome stylus doesn't actually work with this tablet!!!  It only works with the $300 version of this tablet.  They wasted so much of my time with that stylus suggested add-on.  If they thought they'd be clever and make the stylus not work with this version hoping that I'd spring for the more expensive version of this tablet it didn't work.  Watch out when trying to find information on google because they only have a single letter that differentiates this one and the $300 one so it sends you to the more expensive tablet even though I typed in the correct tablet model number .  I was expecting to get the Blur-Free motion, intelligent contrast, and sharpness optimization let alone having the Z Stylus work on my version.  I had my parents and a friend both get an ASUS laptops and another friend got their nexus tablet because of my suggestions, and I've got an ASUS router.  Unless ASUS really tried to win me over as a customer again I will never buy another ASUS product.  I have multiple sclerosis and can't digitally paint as fast as I use to so I needed the extra week and a half that having to send my tablet and stylus back and wait for the refund has cost me."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "My wife got this for me for my birthday last week, after I had put it on my wish list.  When setting it up, some odd things happened, namely I could not sync any of my Amazon purchased apps, it would show none on My Apps menu, but if I tried to DL and install an app that happened to be on the list, Amazon would well me to go find it in My Apps, that I already owned the app.  I did not get that fixed before the next issue cropped up, that does not appear to be software related, and it is a major one.  I use this both while plugged in for long term usage (like listening to music in my office at work or watching Prime TV shows while at lunch) and on battery (like if I am relaxing on my couch at home or need to move out of range of the very short 1m cable).  This issue first cropped up while using my S8.0 while at my desk, just out of range of the cord while on a conference call.  Battery level dropped to 98%, which is to be expected, then went back up to 100% and stayed there for a very long while, several hours.  I then used the S8.0 at home later that evening, with the battery level STILL showing 100%, and the screen just froze, everything was unresponsive.  I grabbed the supplied charger (1.4A, not 2.0A or higher as supported by USB 3.0/3.1) and plugged it in expecting to be able to use it momentarily.  I could not.  I had to wait 15+ minutes before it would turn back on, and the battery showed 2% but charging.  After about a half hour of showing 2%, it jumped up to 100%, fully charged.  I continued using it while plugged in, everything was fine.  At work this week, I used it to listen to music each day, again while plugged in (I'm at work for 10+ hours normally).  I tried to use it at home on battery, and as soon as battery level hit 98%, it froze up.  Plugged in the charger, eventually it showed a full charge.  I tried to use it again on the battery, and again once it hit 98% it froze, except this time it was no longer taking a charge, showed 9% battery level but charging, even though it was not.  I tried to use it yesterday on battery power, and I ended up doing a factory reset because it showed 9% battery, charging (but battery level not increasing and the charger itself remained cool to the touch).  Later in the evening, I tried my Samsung GS5 (genuine) charger (known working charger), again the S8.0 would not take a charge even though it said it was charging.  Factory reset AGAIN.  AGAIN, same issue.  Tried the latest Asus firmware update (from Nov. 18), no change in behavior and it also had trouble installing, possibly due to the battery issue.  My 4GB/64GB model is being returned, and Amazon is sending one to replace it.  I sincerely hope that this issue is not pervasive to the model, as I will be greatly disappointed.  This is not my first Asus device (I only use Acer, Asus or Dell for home and work with great success), so this was a MAJOR disappointment.  The ONLY reason why I gave this 3 stars was that when it works, it is fantastic with an awesome screen, otherwise it would have gotten 1 star.  If the replacement encounters the same problem, I will revise my review and drop the star count.  If the replacement remains trouble free, I will also revise my review.\n\nOne note, I am going to try and do all of the operating/firmware updates prior to doing ANY app installs.  I am also going to use a longer 2m USB cable with the replacement S8.0 when it arrives.  1m is fine for just charging, or transferring data between two devices, but not if you need/want to use the device while plugged in to a wall outlet.\n\nI got the replacement from Amazon 1.5 weeks ago or so, and have been using it daily on and off the charger (with longer aftermarket cord) since it arrived.  I did all of the Asus OS/firmware updates before ever allowing any accounts or other apps to be installed or updated.  I'm not sure if this was as big of a benefit or just placebo, but the replacement tablet has been working fantastic.  I will say, that it would be nice to not have so many Asus installed apps, there are many that I don't care to have or use, pretty much ever.  I've tested it with Real Racing 3, Knights of the Old Republic, Iron Man 3 and a few other games with no issues (I'm not a huge gamer).  I use it for back-ground music at work, streaming from Prime Music and running to my little T-class amp and Onkyo speakers in my office.  It will easily do this for two days running on the battery, including watching 20-25min of TV shows at lunch each day and occasionally hopping on our office cloud resources with Firefox to check production schedules while my laptop (core i7 Asus) is crunching on something in Inventor."}

I think they tried to do too much with this tablet, but the end result is a tablet which is often too frustrating to use.  Ive been using it for over a month now along with the Z Stylus, so here it goes:\n\nCons:\nTons of bloatware which cannot be removed.  You'll die of old age as you are constantly forced to update a bunch of apps which you will never use.\n\nThe app manager takes some getting used to (for example, the Kindle app wouldn't run properly until I adjusted some settings in the manager after consulting with Amazon customer support).\n\nImage galleries will not load properly regardless of which app I use, and the built in gallery will just stop loading.  I thought perhaps it was due to corrupted files, but I have no problem loading them on other devices. (Fast Image Viewer will load all of the files, but its a very basic app with limited features, so no copy or move functions.)\n\nZ Stylus is not as smooth or responsive as Samsung's S Pen.  I didn't know how bad it was until I recently fired up my Note Pro and realized how jittery the Z Stylus was in comparison.  This is a big deal because the main reason I bought this thing was to have a sketch pad more portable than my Note Pro 12.2.\n\nBattery life isn't great.\n\nThe Z Stylus won't work properly while the tablet is charging.  It skips and stops working until you disconnect the charger.  This means no drawing or taking notes while the thing is charging.\n\nIf I set the Z Stylus on top of the tablet while the tablet is sleeping (with the cover in place) the tablet stays in Pen mode and needs to be rebooted.  I've already drained a stylus battery because of this.\n\nPros:\nThe screen is beautiful.\n\nVideos seem to play smoothly.\n\nOther than the image galleries, most apps seem to work fine.\n\nI like the size of the tablet.  Its small enough to be portable, and large enough to be useable (even with the jittery stylus).  For most things, however, I'll stick with my Samsung Note Pro."}

The battery didn't last too long (about 3.5hrs of continuous use of videos/ music and social media with some Web surfing) until i started adjusting brightness and disabling us less running apps; now I can go about 6 hrs before needing to recharge.

In fact, I already have an iPad, and specifically sought out an Android tablet specifically FOR the ability of an entire household to share the device, making use of the multi-user functionality. The software is *designed* for multi-user. Limiting the number of users to less than 8? Crappy, but not that big a deal. Limiting it to some ridiculous number (read: less than 4?)

The backlight bleeds through the bottom of the screen, making it impossible to read books, stream movies, look at pictures, etc..without the black/white patterns screaming through the bottom.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "Fantastic tablet for the price and in this class.\n\nWho it's for:\nMy 10-year old daughter has been using an old ipad 2 to watch youtube and play games (minecraft, temple run games, etc.). The ipad 2 has been slowing down, and because it is only 16gb of memory she has filled it up with apps and pictures multiple times, it slows down even more and has required me to go in multiple times to do mass deletions of stuff. So, with her birthday coming up she asked for an ipad mini as a replacement for the ipad. Problem is the 16gb ($400) current ipad mini doesn't have enough memory, and jumping up the next size to 64GB ($500) is just too much money to spend on a youtube/gaming consumption device for a 10 year old who will beat the hell out of this thing. So, after looking at the current crop of 8\" android tablets, this was the cheapest one with decent specs that got good reviews. We ordered the 32GB version along with a 32GB micro SD card.\n\nExperience:\nI'm an android guy and am somewhat of a gadget nerd, so I can intelligently critique android devices. Phone wise, I've gone from a Samsung Galaxy S3 to Nexus 5 to my new Nexus 6p. I also have a Samsung galaxy Note 8 and a work-supplied ipad air 2 that I use for mostly personal stuff. I can say the Asus skin (software overlay) on top of the Lollipop android operating system is pretty light. The tablet is very responsive; there is no lag like I have always experienced on Samsung devices where there are slight (or sometimes long) delays in opening menus, swiping between home screens, etc. The screen is bright and graphics are sharp. The device is light and thin, and even wrapped in a thin tpu case it is easy to hold for long periods of time. Obviously my daughter has plenty of room on the device for her apps, music, pictures, videos, etc. The battery life is fantastic; my daughter has used this thing for hours of watching videos and playing apps.\n\nI will say that there was one quirk where the security settings would not allow the Amazon app store  to run properly after the app was side loaded onto the device. I had of course changed the permissions to allow installing apps from other sources than the google play store, but the app wouldn't run. I finally chatted with Amazon customer service and they walked me though the setting that needed to be changed to allow the app to run. It is a specific Asus software (security related) thing that stock Android doesn't have, and once I changed it the Amazon app store app worked fine.\n\nOh, and having spent $220 on this tablet + memory card, it leaves us another $230-ish in the budget to get her the new Moto G for Christmas (+ micro sd card), to replace her first-gen Moto G. Same as I would have spent on the ipad mini by itself. Happy parents, happy kid."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "I was excited to get this tablet for the great price and specifications.  It was disappointing when the touchscreen  took 4-5 taps to respond and the keyboard was somewhat erratic. I then read  a few reviews that indicated the touchscreen delay and poor response times were a problem and hopefully would be corrected with updates. I called Asus to discuss this known touchscreen problem and  after much confusion and no help they denied  knowing anything about an issue with the touchscreen they suggested returning the tablet.  I got a replacement tablet that had similar touchscreen issues not as bad but the built in apps (i.e. gmail) would not respond to the settings and again after lot of trouble shooting I called Asus and once again received the run around, I was told the device was out of warranty  (even though it was three day old.) I was put on hold while the issue was being researched and after 25min of being on hold I hung up an called back to no avail.  Same absurd run around then the technician told me to call the place where I bought it to discuss the problems.  I pointed out the manufacturer should address the performance problems of the product not the vendor. I returned device number two and all the accessories I bought to go with it.  This is probably why Google fired Asus from manufacturing  the Nexus 9 - poor quality control and inept- incompetent customer service."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "This review is for the ASUS ZenPad S 8.0 64 GB (Z580CA).\n\nI've only had an iPad (2nd generation) before. I actually enjoyed the iPad, but I ended up selling it because it wasn't all that useful to me. Jump into the future, and now I could use a pad again. At about $300, this is about the high end of the price range I was willing to shell out for. And it's worth it. It should be known that when I received the pad and started it up, I received an OTA update.\n\nThe feel of this pad is quite nice. The faux leather on one side is a little weird, but doesn't detract from holding it. It might actually help. And is doesn't detract from its aesthetics either. This pad looks freakin' nice. It's light enough for me (which is a huge plus over the iPad I had, but to be fair, the iPad was 10\"). I don't use this outside, so I can't say anything about the brightness outside, but inside it's great. I tend to use this most at night with low lights, and the screen adjusts itself automatically to a comfortable level. I don't experience any of the raising or lowering of the screen brightness that other people that reviewed it have. However, I will say that when I want to play a game on it, I will manually raise the brightness to the max. And it's very bright. The contrast is great for playing games like The Room, where there's a lot of bright and dark areas.\n\nSpeaking of games, I don't play games too heavily on the device, but I like to dabble. I've played Final Fantasy IV, The Room and The Room 2, MyVegas Slots (shoosh), and Lara Croft Go, and there hasn't been any hiccups or anything. Not that those games test the limits of devices. I use this pad mostly for reading (Moon+ Reader, Bacon Reader), social networking (Facebook), and entertainment.\n\nFor entertainment, this is a beast. I'll explain why, because it's not just the ZenPad. The ZenPad has made things pretty easy for entertainment. I was worried that I would be stifled because there's no HDMI port on there, and that the new USB connection doesn't have any HDMI dongles available yet. But, it DOES have 802.11ac Wifi. I haven't used it yet because I don't have an AC router, but let me explain why it's good. I bought an Amazon FireStick and threw Kodi on it (formerly XBMC). The ZenPad has, in its settings, a media server. You just enable it and have Kodi look for it on your network, and bam, instant streaming. You can stream via wifi any videos up to 720p. But it's only 720p because of the limitations of 802.11n (which is what I have). So the ZenPad has no trouble streaming 1080p video as long as your wifi can handle it, both sending and receiving. BTW, I tried screen mirroring with the Roku Streaming Stick, and it was horrible. With the Amazon FireStick, it was beautiful, fast and responsive. I have used the ZenPad mirroring to do presentations for my students at work off a FireStick and an old projector.\n\nThe speakers are fairly low. I've been spoiled with my HTC One M8 tho, which has incredible sound for a phone. The audio is passable, but really, get some headphones if you really want to take advantage of the sound. Still, I watch Frasier all the time on Netflix, and it's perfectly fine for light viewing (like before going to bed). Yes, I still watch Frasier.\n\nSome other thoughts:\n\n- The tablet is thin, and very good for holding while reading.\n- I like how the USB charge port is a little off to the side. It makes holding it horizontally a lot easier, but it makes it a little bleh to hold it vertically while plugged in.\n- So many complaints about bloatware, but it was manageable for me and honestly easy to disable and not that invasive. This is the version with 4GB of RAM, however...\n- The ZenUI works great, but truth be told, I use Nova Launcher for all my devices. Nova works great on this as well and does not interfere with any software on the ZenPad.\n- I bought a 6ft Type C cable, and it works fantastically. Makes tablet life a little easier. I recommend it:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Type-C-iOrange-E-trade-6-6-Ft-2M-Braided-Cable-with-Reversible-Connector-for-New-Macbook-12-inch-ChromeBook-Pixel-Nokia-N1-Tablet-Asus-Zen-AiO-and-Other-Devices-with-Type-C-USB-Black/dp/B010VFFU1W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Type C, iOrange-E&trade; 6.6 Ft (2M) Braided Cable with Reversible Connector for New Macbook 12 inch, ChromeBook Pixel, Nokia N1 Tablet, Asus Zen AiO and Other Devices with Type C USB, Black</a>\n\nIf you don't play many games on it, get the $200 version. It should do everything this one can aside from playing games a bit more fluidly."}

I use the Asus mostly on my commute to and from work.  So far I am impressed with everything except battery life, which others have noted is not the best. The display is great and I do like the operating system Asus uses more than what was on the Samsung. Still have bloatware but it doesn't seem as excessive as Samsung.  Overall, a good tablet for what I do with it (videos, reading news) but it is no iPad.  I feel like the combination of price, display and features make this a good value for a middle of the road tablet."}

It is slow in focusing and takes avergae pictures. Indoors it is terrible! Even with the low light assist I feel I went back to Sony floppy disk digital camera photos.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "I have reviewed many tablets as I have a blog dedicated to tablets.  Google \"TabletConnect Blogspot\".  Overall, the ZenPad is the best value Android tablet currently on the market meaning for its price, it is the best tablet on the market.  For $200, you are getting great hardware.  So what are the strengths: 1) 2048x1536 HD screen; 2) $199 price tag; 3) dual front speakers; 4) 32GB of storage which may be enough for most individuals (but expansion slot is available); 5) premium looking tablet; and 6) very good battery life (I have seen worst & it did very well in our battery video loop test).  As for the negatives: 1) annoying power button that is too flush to work properly; 2) possibly no upgrade to Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) [I did reach out to Asus who basically stated it is not in the works but may change]; 3) bloatware [28 non-Google pre-installed apps of which 23 are Asus apps]; and 4) its minor but occasional screen dimming for no reason.  There is no denying that the ZenPad S 8.0 is the best $200 tablet on the market for now.  The ZenPad is not meant to compete with tablets costing $300-$500 so there are certainly better Android tablets out there but ZenPad wins in the $150 - $250 market.  Other comments: I played Asphalt 7 and Dead Trigger 2 with no lag or stuttering. Can be rooted.  Camera takes OK pics (check my blog for some pictures taken with the ZenPad S 8.0).  Never had Wifi issues (I know many have complained so I assume its their routers.)  I love the knock on & off feature similar to the LG phones (double tap to turn screen on & off).  Asus has been good with providing minor updates but I am not holding my breath for Android 6.0.\n\nTips: Turn off Power Saving mode; turn off auto-brightness; disable or uninstall bloatware; use the installed Auto Start app to disable apps."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "I have to say that I was really excited for this tablet when I reviewed the specs and out of the box I was very pleased; however after 2 days the top quarter of the touchscreen no longer responded accurately. It was an awkward situation of relying on auto rotate to get to the notification pane. This in and of itself didn't bother me as I understood that this is a new release, and of course there will be bugs in any new hardware production and I'm also just lucky that way. I returned it and a replacement was shipped quickly. I was disappointed again to find that the replacement suffered from the exact same defect. I was a little shaken by this and was hesitant to try again. I have to say I am very happy that I did. With receipt of the third tablet, I was finally satisfied. I have been a loyal supporter of ASUS since my first laptop and am continually impressed by the amount of value they pack into their products.\n\nPros: This is a fast tablet that is able to handle anything that you need or just want to put it through. One of the fastest processors on the market and the largest amount of RAM that you can buy at this time in a tablet this size it is very nimble. The screen was surprisingly crisp, definitely surprising from an IPS display especially when tweaked with the ASUS Splendid color controls. I love the Zen UI. It is large, however, it allows an unprecedented amount of customization from a stock ROM. If you want to change it there is a way from background to scroll effects. This is, in my opinion, the pinicle of tablets at the moment.\n\nCons: Well if you previously read, of course receiving defective tablets before finally getting a fully functional tablet does constitute a serious con, however I feel it's an inconvenience and doesn't follow my history with ASUS products so I won't hold it against them too much. My major con with the tablet is a large amount of fairly useless apps. Asus does try to make some great apps, and many of them are useful, others don't seem to work well or there is already a better app available in the marketplace. I appreciate the effort but I would appreciate the option to uninstall them from the tablet unrooted. There are a few preinstalled apps that you can uninstall, but I don't understand why they're there to begin with.\n\nAll that being said, this is a great tablet, fast, huge on-board storage, customization options, thin, and a pretty screen. I am anticipating getting the z-stylus to be able to fully use the tablet's options. I would definitely recommend this to someone who want's top-tier hardware for a bargain price, but is also willing to handle a little frustration if it comes to it. I'm hoping that this tablet continues to function well, but I will update accordingly."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "So far so good\nI purchased the more expensive 64 gig tablet with the faster processor than the base model, so the $299 tablet vs the $199 tablet.\n\nThe more expensive version has a faster processor, more storage, better camera and more RAM.\nThe screen is very sharp, but often needs some tweaking out of the box for the best settings, as does the sound.\n\nVERY light, easy to hold.  Optional Zen Stylus for active entry for note taking.  Very nice screen. So far very snappy.\n\nThe software is pretty poor and lots of bloatware. Perhaps there will be a way to root and flash a more stable rom on the system. For the meantime though I'm willing to accept this.  Not a major bummer yet, but a more modest nexus skin would have been a much better choice for asus (odd given they made the asus nexus 7 which is an all time classic, but too many generations removed for modern use today)\n\nFor $100 more you could get the Samsung Galaxy S2, which has a better screen, is slightly lighter and has a fingerprint sensor. It only has 32 gig internal storage vs 64 for the asus.  It seems lots of review sites are listing the s2 8 inch as 64 gig, but it is not.  It has a microsd slot like the asus zenpad, but internal storage for apps is a huge bonus when files are getting bigger and bigger.\n\nSo far, for the price this is an amazing deal.  Time will tell if the tablet holds up. And yes this model has a usb-c port.  While it is NOT rated as a high speed port, I was able to connect to my computer to download music files to the tablet and it seemed quite fast--so perhaps it is faster than the reviewers expect.\n\nThe only thing really missing is a fingerprint sensor, but but the price and larger internal ram, more on board storage and optional zen stylus, this seems like a solid deal.\n\nUPDATE--I got the Zen Stylus which works pretty well as an active stylus.  Pleased with it for only $30 more.\nSince I purchased this...Nvidia re-released the Shield Tablet--now the Shield Tablet K1.  For only $200.\n\nIt is a good deal but having tried both--I opted to stick with the zenpad for a few reasons\n1) more internal storage\n2) The zen stylus is much more accurate than the stylus you can buy for the shield tablet\n3) screen is much much better--no comparison!\n4) Zenpad is MUCH thinner and more ergonomic--the shield tablet is not terrible but a mini tank in comparison.  Also much more difficult to hold.\n\nIf you are going to game a lot you might consider the nividia tablet--and it has a more vanilla android system....but since my primary job for the zen pad is media consumption and not games I prefer the zenpad"}

Over the past few years, I've owned both Nexus 7's, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S, the Dell Venue 8 7840 (32gb) and the IPad 2. This has to be my favorite one of them all. I honestly cannot find any major faults with it.\n\nThe hardware is more than adequate. The Intel proc is more than capable and the 4GB of ram really keeps things smooth. For comparison the Dell Venue 8 has the exact same proc (but only 2GB) of RAM and runs like a dog! ZenUI is not a bad interface and can easily be replaced with your favorite launcher. The wifi works pretty well, I've read some reports of slower than advertised speeds, but I have yet to experience it. The battery life is middle of the road, Its better than a Nexus 7, but not as good as an Ipad. Unless you are the type of person who spends hours at a time on your tablet, battery should not be an issue.\n\nThe only complaint that many will have is the amount of included software. Most of it isn't needed and can be easily removed. I'm also unsure if this device will receive any updates (Marshmallow). Overall, this tablet is pretty hard to beat for the money."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "Just received the tablet yesterday, so this is sort of a short review that I'll update as needed.\n\nPROS: Tablet is beautiful, no lag in launching apps or switching apps.  Lots of onboard storage (I have the 32 gig version)  Audio sounds good if you don't do anything else with the tablet (*see problem below, however). Almost a perfect tablet.\n\nCONS:\n* Rebooting on its own - A few hours after updating the tablet, I noticed that it rebooted itself.  Somewhat concerned as at least one other person has noted this as an issue. Now I'll have to keep an eye out for other unscheduled reboots.\n\n* Audio clipping/popping when switching applications - This is a more annoying problem.  When listening to audio (in my case, Spotify), doing anything else (switching apps, typing etc.) causes a noticeable clicking or hesitation in the audio.  It's almost like the processor lags for a second when you're doing anything.  I turned off the keyboard sounds and disabled the onboard audio enhancement/equalizer.  Neither fixed the problem.  It's reproducible every time when using Spotify (haven't tried other audio sources). CMAustinTX also reported this, so I doubt it's a one off problem."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "When I opened the package, I LOVED this tablet. I've always liked the iPad mini's form factor. When I turned it on, however, I noticed that small blue\"sparkles\" light up randomly in lower left corner of the screen, and when that happens, the screen becomes FAR less responsive. Sometimes the sparkles show up, sometimes they don't. I suspect there is some sort of \"short\" is occurring. Updating the tablet didn't fix the problem. Sooo, I'm returning it for a replacement with the same item. Hopefully, the second one will be the charm! I will update this review after I get the second one.\n\nAddendum: After receiving a faulty first tablet, the second one arrived yesterday. I have been playing with it and configuring it for hours, and for the most part this is a great tablet. The only complaint that I have is a complaint that is shared by many who purchase these modern tablets: too much bloatware. Asus simply puts too much carp onto their tablets, and it is simply unnecessary. I previously owned both years versions of the Nexus 7, and the pure Android experience is clearly the way to go. I also have owned 2 Moto X smartphones, and they were only very lightly skinned by Motorola. These tablets and phones were fantastic. Asus please, please model your current tablets after the old Nexus 7 and give us a pure Android experience. This is why the tablet loses one star.\nMy second complaint is with Amazon, and their Underground App store. When I loaded this on to the new tablet, it would not let me download any of the apps I purchased from Amazon previously, essentially stating that I had no apps either on the device or in the cloud. In order to get Amazon Instant Video on the device, I had to go to my computer, delete the app from My apps on the Amazon website, then go back to my Amazon Underground app and reinstall from there. I still don't know what to do about all of the other apps that are still in the cloud in My Apps because if I delete many of them, they will never be retrievable. Amazon FIX THIS. A quick perusal of other comments demonstrates that I am not the only one having this difficulty.\nOverall though, this is a great little tablet. There is absolutely no lag, the screen is beautiful, and I think the 8 inch form factor is the perfect size. It should be noted that I got the 64 GB version, and I cannot comment on the lower-priced model. Overall then, kudos to Asus for a great tablet, with one star off for the bloatware, and BOOOO to Amazon for their stupid underground app that won't let me get to the apps that I already own.\n\nADDENDUM: My apologies to Amazon! Thanks to GUSTRON3000 below, Amazon Underground now works. It was the Asus Auto-Start Manager that was the problem. See his post below, and my response, for how to get the Amazon Underground app to sync and to attain your Amazon apps! Once again, though, it was one of Asus's added cruft programs that was the problem. Pure Android is the way to go Asus!! You made the Nexus 7, a great tablet, without any cruft!"}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "**Update, 11/25/2015\nWithin a few days of writing my original review, I believe I found a way around the extremely broken WiFi issue.\nMy home wireless network uses 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands (dual band). I had both networks saved in my device, and it seemed that the tablet just didn't know what to do with this, so it would blow it's brains out periodically and lose it's ability to transfer data over the network. I removed one of the saved access points, and everything has been working pretty well! I haven't had a connection issue in the past 2 weeks since I did this.\nI still consider this a flaw in the software, as my previous tablet and my phones have never had this issue.\n\nOne other issue that I have discovered is the screen will not register input while running certain apps. I have really noticed this in the YouTube app, when watching a video in full-screen. When I try to tap the screen to bring up the controls, nothing happens. I usually have to tap anywhere from 3-7 times until I get a response.\n\nThese are both issues that I highly recommend Asus investigate. I don't believe that my unit is defective, and device test apps work perfectly.\n\nI am upgrading my rating from 1 star to 3. This is a fine product, but it seems that there has been an oversight when it comes to quality testing on the software.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW, 11/04/2015:\n\nThis is a review of the Z580CA Model (4GB RAM/64GB), with 5 days of use as of 11/4/2015.\nPros:\n- Solid Performance\n- Beautiful Screen\n- Decent battery life\n- USB Type-C connection\nCons:\n- Frequent wireless connection issues (Deal Breaker!)\n- Tons of Bloatware (some of which can be completely uninstalled, which is nice)\n- Jumpy/ faulty sensors (magnetometer)\n-Long charge time (sometimes?)\n\nThe tablet performs very well. I haven't run anything too heavy, but for general use it works great so far. The tablet is responsive and operation is smooth. 1 star for Asus!\n\nZenUI is interesting. It resembles the stock Android UI, with a few improvements/ additional functionality. I am a fan of the automatic \"Smart grouping\" feature, which will place newly installed apps into category folders. It took me a little while to get used to it, but now I really like it. Star for Asus!\n\nThe screen is crisp and colorful. I haven't noticed any blurring or pixelation of graphics or text. Brightness has a wide range from fairly dim to very bright. The screen is easy to view outside during the day, but can be a little bright at night. Using a screen dimmer app has remedied this, and keeps me from lighting up the room with the screen's back-light while reading in bed. Another star for Asus!\n\nThe battery lasts a good amount of time. Generally, I will run it down to 75% from a couple hours of browsing Reddit, watching YouTube videos, reading news articles, etc. The tablet is listed as having an 8 hour battery life, and that seems to be exactly what I'm getting from it! The only drawback regarding the battery is that it can take a long time to charge. Going from 80% to 100% can take about 30-40 minutes. When I first received the tablet, charge level was at around 55%, and it took around 3 hours to fully charge. At that charge rate, you would have to charge the device for over 6 hours to get around 8 hours of general use. While this is not a huge concern, it can be quite an inconvenience! We'll call this one a tie, Asus..\n\nI also appreciate the Type-C USB connection. Gone are the days where you have to worry about which way you're plugging in the USB cable! This is a double edged sword though, as now I need to buy USB C cables/ adapters, but I foresee many more devices moving to this new connector type in the very near future. I wish that the included 3ft cable was longer, but I can't really take points off for that! Yet another star for Asus!\nI was a little disappointed when I found out that YouTube 360 videos, Street View, and Sky Map don't work well, but this is due to not having a gyroscope sensor, and is not a testament to anything being wrong with the device.\nSaying that, the magnetometer is very jumpy, and can change up to 8 degrees while sitting on a table, which seems like a hardware/ software issue. In comparison, my phone's magnetometer reading will vary about 2 degrees when placed in the same conditions. I have attempted to calibrate the magnetometer (multiple times) which has not improved the issue.. -1 Point for Asus..\nHere's the thing that is unforgivable: WiFi is broken.\nI can initially connect without issue, but anywhere from a few seconds to minutes after connecting, I can no longer access anything on the local network or reach the internet. Other devices on WiFi will work at the time, but the ZenPad will show that it's still connected and will no longer \"surf\". This issue is present on multiple networks/ access points, and occurs on both 2.4GHz and 5GHz networks.\nTo remedy this, I have to turn off WiFi in settings, then turn it back on (or disconnect/ reconnect to the same network). This will fix it for anywhere from a couple of minutes or longer, with an average of 20-30 minutes between occurrences. Occasionally, I will see the WiFi indicator in the status bar disconnect then reconnect, which *sometimes* fixes the problem, but manually reconnecting is the only thing that definitely seems to fix for a short amount of time. This issue occurs during use, while charging, and while sleeping. Two factory resets have not improved the situation at all, and the tablet is updated to the latest firmware.\n-100 stars.. This one is unforgivable...\n\nDue to the WiFi issue, I cannot currently recommend the Zenpad S 8.0 to anyone. I will be returning this tablet to Amazon for a replacement.  I hope that I just have a faulty unit, and that a replacement will not have this problem.\n\nI will update my review once my unit has been replaced.\nMy Rating as of 11/4/2015: 1 star (0 stars, if it were possible)"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "I have had a Google Nexus 7 for a few years and since that was made by ASUS, I looked at this as the next generation of that tablet. Besides being larger, it noticed immediately that the screen is more responsive to touch, both with my fingers and with a stylus.  I must not be picky or very observant because I don't see much difference between the Zen UI that has gotten some poor reviews and the stock Android UI.  Yeah, it is a little different, but after about 30 seconds, I didn't think about it anymore. I use this to play games and stream some Netflix and Dish Network TV. So far, it has been flawless and picture is very clear. I have also listened to some music and was pleasantly surprised by the sound from the tiny speaker- nothing great, but the clarity was good, with individual instruments being discernable instead of just getting a jangle of sound. Battery life is not really any better than the Nexus 7, which is a little disappointing as I expected improvement, but I can usually get thru a day before recharging and I use the screen for gaming and/or tv for several hours each day.  I also like the USB-c charger connection as there is no wrong way to insert the cable. I always get it wrong with my old tablet and current phone. The only negative I have found - and this is picky, is the on/off and volume buttons on the side are a bit hard for me to press. I wish they stuck out just a bit more. Sometimes I am not precise and nothing happens. I am glad I have a cover that automatically turns it on when I open the cover, as hitting the button precisely is a challenge for me. I really have to turn it on its side, look at it  and make sure I hit it just with my fingernail to make the volume go up or down."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "This has a brilliant, sharp display, good processor, lots of RAM, lots of internal memory and support for a micro SD card. The battery is weak, lasts maybe six hours, and slow to charge. The operating system is old and unlikely to be updated, but Lollipop is fine in my humble opinion.  The ZenUI apps can easily be disabled so they do not run in the background, they just are not a problem. I've found two of them to actually be useful.\n\nThe battery is too small. If you can live with this limitation, this is an excellent tablet with a beautiful display, fast processor, lots of RAM, more than enough internal memory and a slot for a micro SD card. The 4:3 aspect ratio 8 inch display is ideal for my purposes, the thin bezels make a large enough screen but a small enough tablet. It's very light and easy to hold with one hand, an ideal ebook reader, great for web browsing and social media, and the exceptional amount of internal and external memory makes it ideal for storing a large music and video library for offline use, as well as maps for navigation off the grid. The aspect ratio is not optimized for today's movies and television, so 21st century video will be letterboxed. The speakers are not bad, there is a special Asus ZenUI app for equalization that you should keep handy if you listen to music or watch movies without headphones. They don't compare to HTC Boomsound speakers, but they're alright.\n\nIf you can afford the extra hundred dollars, get the model with the faster processor and extra RAM, you'll be happier with it, and it will last  longer before becoming obsolete. I looked at many tablets to replace my Nexus 10, and chose this over the Nexus 9 because it has much more internal memory and an external microSD card slot.\n\nThere seems to be a problem with the Marshmallow update."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "I started with the earlier Z580C model because I liked the $200 price.  I really liked that tablet, but it had conflicts with my network and BT headset -- I was getting constant buffering on Netflix when I used the BT.  I returned the C to BestBuy and decided to pay the extra $100 for the Z580CA primarily to get the 802.11ac networking.  I was betting that 5GHz wifi would eliminate BT conflicts.  The CA model is almost identical to the C model, but better.  I've had it about a week and I haven't yet had ANY buffering issues.  I get fantastic download speeds through the 802.11ac wifi.  Like the C model, the CA has great screen resolution, it is fast, and it is a solid, nice looking tablet.  I like the type 3 USB connector that doesn't require me to figure out what side to plug in -- that's one area where Apple has had a leg up.  If you're looking for map apps, the GPS is very sensitive and works well inside a car or house.  I haven't really given the battery a good test, but that's not too much of an issue for me.  I don't think you can do better for the price, and you may not be able to do much better even if you don't consider the price."}

Very frustrating. I have applied the latest updates, and it seems pretty unpredictable."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "Ive used an iPad for the past 8 years, in one form or the other, and loved the experience. That is, until I ordered the Asus Zenpad S 8 4GB/64GB and now question my loyalty towards the Apple brand for so long. From the interface, to the pure speed of this tablet, everything is top notch! Asus even has an app that has direct contact with their UI creators, which allows you and others to ask for and learn the status of feature updates. From under review to being worked on to completed, your wanted features are quickly implemented.\n\nThis thing blows through anything you throw at it, from the most GPU intensive games to productivity apps. The 4GBs of memory and high CPU/ GPU speeds allow for extensive multitasking and games that give some PS4 titles a run for their money. Add a gamepad and you have a great, on-the-go gaming system. With 64GBs of on-board storage, plus a micro sd slot that allows for 128GB+ cards, you will never want for more space. The only omission from this otherwise perfect package, is a built in HDMI port.\n\nBattery lasts from 6-8 hours plus, depending on what you are doing, with a full charge takng around an hour. Games will be on the lower side, moderate browsing will keep you going for days. The great USB C(3.1) port allows for quick power plug in without fumbling around to make sure your cable is in the upright position and allows for the latest and greatest transfer speeds. Tap to awake is also a nice feature that allows quick turn on without feeling around for the power button. The ZenUI is nice and allows for personalization of almost any feature available on the tablet.\n\nThe screen is nice and shares Apples resolution at 2048x1536, though Apples iPad has the brighter of the screens. Thats not to say that the Asus screen is dim, but not at the level of the iPad(at least the 9.7\" version), I don't have a mini to compare it to(though Im sure it is equal to the Asus in the brightness department). Viewing the two screens together with the chrome browser open to the Zenpad product page on Amazon, shows a bright white background on the iPad with an off white background on the Zenpad. Asus is now working on an upgrade that will allow an even brighter setting(200%), but will come at greater drain to battery(though, supposedly not as much as one would think). This may bring the Zenpads brightness level up to that of the iPad Air level. I will report back when that happens. This being said, the Zenpads brightness is still at a high level and is higher than most other phones and tablets. I did notice that turning the Zenpads bluelight filter on gave the whites a lighter look and closer to that of the iPad, making me think the panel Asus is using has a push in the blues and this is their way of combating it. After further inspection(on Yahoos front page) the whites on the Zenpad actually seem more pleasant than that of the iPad(due to the bluelight filter). When Asus updates their brightness setting, the Zenpad screen may have the better picture.\n\nThe sound is actually pretty good out of the two front facing stereo speakers, not once crackling... even at full volume. Of course, nothing will beat output to a better amplifier and set of speakers. The Zenpad S 8 will stream Dolby and DTS HD over bluetooth for the audiophiles of the world.\n\nOverall, you won't find a better tablet for the money. It is stacked enough to allow for many years of use without upgrade. More powerful than any other tablet on the market, especially in this price range. Cheaper than the best iPad and twice as powerful."}

This is my first tablet and it was purchased for use in my new truck that is Wi-Fi equipped. It found the truck setting just fine but I am having trouble in my home installing the router password and it won't let me start over. I went on line and can't find any  company help. I'm old and it's new so that may be part of the problem."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "I have had a few months now to put this tablet through the paces and see how it does.  It goes everywhere with me, conveniently fits in my purse (at 8\" it's sized between my phone and my laptop, which is perfect).  One of the best ways it comes in handy is that we spend a lot of time in medical offices, hospitals, etc.  We just hook onto their wi-fi and we can do schoolwork, check email, communicate with the medical team and relatives, etc.\n\nASUS is a well-known and reliable brand, with great customer service.  This is our second ASUS over the years, and we rarely have any trouble at all with them.  The few times that we've run into a glitch, the ASUS customer service team expertly and efficiently guided us through the software adjustments (in both cases it was a minor software glitch that was easily fixed).\n\nOne thing that gave us trouble right away is the power button.  It's on the right side, but it's recessed in such a way that we can't seem to easily find and activate it.  As in many other tech situations, I have to call in the big guns...one of my kids.\n\nAnother important part of the tablet that I absolutely must comment on is the incredible screen.  For movies, TV shows, YouTube videos, etc., it is beautiful and clear.  It is a delight for the eyes.\n\nThe menus are intuitive and very user-friendly, so young and old and in-between seem to have no problems maneuvering around.\n\nOur whole family is thrilled with our new tablet.  We looked hard for problems, negatives, drawbacks, etc. and really can't come up with much other than a finicky power button.  Good brand, great screen, good customer service, a convenient size, user-friendly, and we definitely recommend it very highly.  Sure hope this review has helped you."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "There are reviews included here for the Z580C which is the $199 dumbed down version. The Z580CA at $299 is excellent. I have a Nexus 9 and this 4GB/64GB Z580CA is just as fast, lighter, with good battery discharge and recharge time. One thing I will concede to the Nexus 9 is maximum brightness but the Z580CA is plenty bright. When reading the reviews here almost all reviews that are less than 4 stars are for the $199 Z580C. I am very happy with mine and will probably replace my wife's Kindle with another Z580CA.\n\nI think ASUS has made a mistake using the same model number less the A. They should have opted for an entirely different model number to keep the reviews from dragging down their flagship and creating consumer confusion. Compare the specs for the two models and for $100 more you get a  far superior tablet."}

I finally got a Stylus, and while it works - what for?  All it is good for is drawing or tapping on the virtual keyboard.  (swiping with Stylus is useless)  Both Evernote and OneNote do not have any draw to text capability.  A huge reason I bought the unit.  I can use the Evernote \"handwriting\" option.  I was hoping I could take a picture of a document and then mark it up.  Nope.\n\nAs a reader and web browsing,  great.  To go the next level of usefulness, I'm not sold.  Thinking of returning it for a Chromebook.\n\nOverall nice.  I bought it for reading Kindle Books, my Bible in a comfortable position.  I do enjoy reading on this tablet.  and I really would like to take notes with a Stylus, which I have not yet purchased.  Couple of issues.  A.) charging port is not in the bottom middle of the device, like my last few Android devices, so a little harder to find the port without actually looking.  B.) The position of the power button and volume rocker is flipped.  I like the power button up much higher.  I don't know how many times I have put it into sleep mode just by adjusting my grip.  C.)  Kinda a slippery tablet, but has a nice rubber strip with good grip on the left side  Being right handed, I hold the tablet with my left hand, and I need the rubber stip on my finger tips so I can hold it without slipping out, so I just flip my tablet upside down and I can hold it one handed. Thankfully the screen flips quickly.  D.) Signing up for the ASUS webstorage service. I had to finish online as it did not accept my password I initially created, but would accept on the web page.  Based on issues A, B and C I  am considering returning it."}

Sometimes the screen would randomly go into sleep mode and go blank. I would push the power button to get out of sleep mode and sometimes it would immediately go blank again.

However read on to the end where I talk about the \"TruVivid\" feature that I found very annoying, turning it off made a huge difference.\n- very snappy processor, no problems decoding 1080p 60fps (I don't have anything heavier to test), and working in any app is a breeze\n- plenty of RAM and internal storage\n- micro SD card slot (some tablets out there don't have it these days)\n- light and sturdy\n- beautiful design\n- GPS\n\nCons:\n- I don't have an explanation for this, maybe not everything is optimized for Intel processor, but I get lags sometimes: in the menus of games, or just apps taking longer to start up, compared to my 2014 Moto E, where hardware if far more modest.\n- ZenUI extension gets in the way sometimes, and having used to pure Android on Motorolas I find it hard to navigate all the settings available. But once you set it up, it just works.\n- \"TruVivid\" feature is annoying, is enabled by default, and it's not obvious how to turn it off.\n\nNow, this \"TruVivid\" feature, according to product page, is supposed to make sure that brightness and contrast of the screen always stay adequate for whatever is displayed at the moment. In real life scenarios it means brightness and contrast jumping up and down every time screen contents change. You opened the apps drawer, which is a number of icons against dark-ish background? Contrast/brightness will slowly fade, making text almost unreadable. Open google search, which is a few dark elements against white background? Contrast/brightness will slowly increase. This drove me nuts, until I found how to turn this off:\n\n- Go to all applications, open Power saver (of all things)\n- disable \"smart saving\"\n\nThat's it! No more pesky contrast changes, and your text will remain readable whatever you do. Maybe this will reduce battery life of the device, but I'd rather spend 5 hours enjoying the new tablet, than 7 hours being annoyed by random changes in contrast.\n\nAll in all, very solid device I would recommend to anyone."}

Avoid 8GB /1GB ram its already too small, and you are wasting your money.\n\nThe tablet screen aspect ratio is excellent for reading, and it is light weight, some reviewers have pointed out that the screen may be dim under certain conditions or the appearance of a yellowish color when the brightness is set too low. It took me a couple of days to get accustom to it, but I realized that the soft tone is great for reading white pages at night with the lights off.\n\nPrice, after buying several expensive ($400 +) tablets and phones during the past years, I came to the conclusion that it was better to buy devices in the $200-$250 range, may be $300 max in some cases; technology, firmware and apps are constantly changing, and after a couple of years I ended with an old expensive device that lagged in all aspects. It is better to keep the price difference in your pocket, and change more often the devices. (But definitely I stay away from cheap low specs unknown brands devices; it is just throwing away money, avoid $100-$150 Phones or tables)\n\nASUS apps, yes there are a lot of them in it, but I can easily turn them off, as some of the Google apps that I do not use. Since I have different brand name devices, I decided to use Google apps as much as possible, so there is a better synchronization and standardization across all devices that we own at home.\n\nAs for the launcher I am using the Nova Launcher in all devices, the main advantages of this launcher is that I can back up the screen/desktop settings , resize the icons, icons letter size, and I am able to lock the desktop so no one can move or delete the icons as they are set on the screen. I highly recommend you the Nova Launcher.\n\nAsus launcher UI, there is something good for those who are not technically inclined, and a standard Android  UI maybe overwhelming. Asus provides with the choice Asus Easy Mode which is a simplified UI / Launcher, it is built-in in new Asus phones and tablets, but is is also available as a standalone app [...]\nThe link for the manual is below, in case you want to read about it.\n\nSpeaker sound quality and microphone is good for a Skype or Viber conversation, clear no noises, good for watching a YouTube video, as for music get a decent pair of headphones.\n\nTwo cameras, front and back, no flash. I do not talk much about a cameras in any tablet, for me are just an emergency camera, I prefer to use the one on my phone, it is very uncomfortable  to take a picture with a tablet, which may end on the floor. So how many mega pixels and so on, you can check the specs, the only thing relevant for me in that department, is that it has a decent front and back camera for web call Skype or Viber. In case you ask the back camera is good for web calls, for example during a web call you want to show someone an item that you just bought. That is the reason for the 2 MP Front Camera and  the 5 MP Rear Camera, there is no need for a million MP camera on a tablet.\n\nRecommended Accessories\n64 GB Samsung Evo micro SD, the price was very good $24. Amazon ASIN: B00IVPU7AO\nTPU Case, I needed to protect the tablet, but also I wanted to add a little thickness to the tablet, it makes it more comfortable to hold it while reading Amazon ASIN: B0159GPWDE\nScreen Protector Film - JOTO Anti Glare. The anti glare film is great for reading Amazon ASIN: B0131JDSC8\n\nAsus on the web\nAsus web: [...]\nAsus manual: [...]\nAsus specs: [...]\n\nWhy not a Samsung?, I have bought over 7 Samsung devices, they are great quality devices, but I got tired of the physical home button, the touchwiz, and the lack of updates, if you check in Amazon you will see that most of the 8 Samsung tablets still running android 4.4, and in my personal experience, I doubt that they will ever get to android 5, while android 6 is already on the market. Also of those Samsung 8 tablets that compare in price to the Assus, the Samsung have lower memory specs (ram and storage).\nThen Samsung has a million different SKU / models for the same device, to a point that it becomes hard work to find which is the most recent / newest product , and to compare specs, and prices. I believe that if a manufacturer wants to confuse me with their product offering, I better skip them. ( I may end with an older discontinued item, with little or none tech support)\nSo for those reasons, at the present time I decided to pass on Samsung devices.\n\nI hope you find my review helpful, Do you have a questions?  let me know.\n\nUpdate October 16, 2015\nConnecting to weak WiFi signals\nIf you are trying to connect to a weak WiFi (you are far from the router) here is 3 things that you need to do\nThe tablet has better reception in portrait and landscape with the power and volume buttons facing down\nTurn off power saving\nSettings>WiFi>3dots menu>advanced>keep WiFi on during sleep>always\n\nThe battery will last less, but you have good chances of getting that weak signal. Remember to change back the settings, if you no longer need it.\n\nUpdate September, 2016\nMarshmallow Android 6 is available as a manual update, which requires you to download the firmware, and install it to the root directory, no OTA available.\nlink Asus [...]\nUpdates are available for Z580C for the (Z580CA look for the appropiate support link)\n\nUpdate October 29, 2015\nThe tablet received a minor OTA update, still 5.0 android (total of 2 OTA updates, since I bought it)\nPay attention to this, the right way of holding the tablet in Landscape mode is with the power and volume buttons facing down. (you will get full wifi bars)\nAlso, the volume display on the screen will move/agree according to pressing + or - volume buttons."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "This is a very nice tablet that is thin, lightweight, boasts surprisingly good sound from its internal speakers, a great visual display, and a port for a micro sd card to increase storage. On the less positive side, this tablet is not LTE/4G capable so you will need to connect to a WiFi network in order to utilize online services. Also, the tablet is powered by Android so you won't be using Adobe Flash-powered applications, which may be a problem for some in terms of versatility. There also seems to be an inordinate amount of preinstalled programs (just crappy, mostly unnecessary apps that I believe most consumers would rather decide for themselves whether or not they want or need them, and some are not all that simple to remove). Upon setup, you'll find that this junk software - the stuff we don't even have a choice to install or not - seems to be constantly updating and slowing down the system. It's not as if its unique or unusual for a computer manufacturer to bloat their product with garbage you'll never use, but it doesn't make it any less annoying.\n\nBut overall this seems to be holding up pretty well (over a relatively short period of a few weeks, truth be told) so far. I have yet to be presented with many noteworthy issues. It's as intuitive and easy-to-use as the average device of this kind. Another very welcome plus is the excellent onboard camera (ASUS Pixelmaster), which does take quite awesome photos. Check the specs here on the product description, no real need to retype a laundry list of features. Suffice it to say that for general web applications, watching videos (and again, the video quality is really outstanding), and all the conveniences of a tablet, this is a solid choice and seems fairly priced given the features. The 8\" screen is, for me, the right size of display, definitely not unwieldy to hold and not too small where you find yourself not able to enjoy videos etc.\n\nIf I'm nitpicking, I find the location of the power button kind of annoying - it's right below the volume buttons, so if you go to adjust the volume down in a hurry you risk hitting the power button by mistake. Also, for some reason I find the power button a little iffy in terms of responsiveness - it doesn't always turn the tablet on right away, at least that seems to have been a pattern for me. But it's really not a major thing and hasn't preventing me from really enjoying the tablet."}

I do like this tablet, don't get me wrong, but I find that there are performance lags, most likely associated with the Asus software that's loaded on top.  The specs on this tablet lead me to believe that everything should run smoothly, but where I notice the lags the most is when I'm going to the Home page after running an application.  Only the wallpaper shows, and it will take a little bit for the apps and groups of apps to appear.\nAnyway, good tablet, but I'm going to go with the Nexus 9 instead."}

I have not had issues with the power button but I am still getting used to the power button being below the volume rocker (I'm always pressing it when trying to lower volume) I use this tablet mainly for school and watching my shows. The processor is very good and can open up my books and load its content very quickly. I didn't think I would like 4:3 ratio but its not a big deal and I can still see everything ok. Huge pro over my old samsung is no physical home buttons, no more pressing the back button when watching a show.

I loaded up 5 movies to keep me entertained for a couple recent flights now that most airlines (at least that I use) no longer offer movies domestically.\n\nThe device's ability to add a micro-SD card eliminated frustrating storage limits that my iPad has... especially with all of the videos I both shoot (home movies) and watch when traveling.\n\nPerformance of the ASUS ZenPad, even when accessing data from the micro-SD card, is fast and consistent.\n\nI have been especially impressed with the camera -- both for the quality of photos and videos. In fact, on our recent vacation we used it exclusively as our camera/camcorder.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "Purchased elsewhere at the big blue and yellow retailer...\nPros: Nice, bright screen.  Not overly expensive.\nCons: Shuts down on it's own daily (and at the most inconvenient times)  Bloatware, bloatware bloatware.  Seriously? I can't uninstall the Amazon Kindle app?  It would be worth $20 more for a \"clean\" OS.  The in-built keyboard is awkward.\n\nI don't understand why manufacturers can't just roll their hardware and leave the User Experience to the company that designed the OS.  I'm an avid user of Google-branded products and unfortunately the ZenUI changes are not up-to-snuff.\n\nNow for the shutdowns...\nFirst, I changed as much of the UI to Google-provided apps as possible, the keyboard, the launcher, everything.  Then boom, shutdown.  For a split second, I see the \"Powering down...\" dialog and then poof, reboot time.  It happens over and over and over.  I've narrowed it to being in dark or confined places OR heat.  I have a case (unofficial because I can't find the official one) and it seems to happen when opening or closing that case.  Maybe it's dark enough to think it should shut down?  But why?  So I removed the case and have been running it caseless.  Now it shuts down less, but still often.  I'll think \"oh the battery is dead or something\" nope, it'll start right up with 90% battery left.  I know I'm not the only person with this issue and I'm sure ASUS is getting plenty of returns and RMAs for this.\n\nI contacted ASUS who asked me to do factory wipes (to no avail) and ultimately want me to send it in for RMA.  I haven't opened an RMA, but I fully expect that I will be required to pay shipping to ASUS for the new version, then get a refurbished one back.  At $200, what's the point?  10% of the cost to send it back?"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "There are so many tablet choices out there it can be hard to sort through them all.  At the high-end there are the iPads and Surface and at the low end a lot of Android tablets youve never heard of.  In this price point I would consider two options: name brand Android vs. Kindle Fire.  For kids I buy Kindle Fires, which have excellent parental controls.  For adults I suggest name-brand Android tablets which provide better performance and more flexibility than a Kindle Fire.\n\nAsus isn't the only choice but its a good one.  They have a long term reputation for quality but tend to be a better value than the bigger name brands like Samsung.  I consider their quality on par with Samsung, well above Amazon, and step below Apple.  The quad-core Intel CPU far out performs anything you will find in a Kindle Fire and compares well against higher end Samsung ARM based tablets.  It does this at very low (~1.3GHz) clock speeds keeping leakage power loss to a minimum.  This uses a Moorfield platform SOC which includes the excellent Silvermont cores.  Its a quad-core single threaded design. For graphics it has a PowerVR G6430 clocked around 450Mhz (same basic graphics found on the Apple A7 but a higher clock).  I would rate this as a mid-tier graphics core that will handle anything Android will throw at it, but it would be underpowered if this was a Windows tablet.  It fits with the price point but you will find better cores in higher-end Apple and Samsung products.\n\nI personally found the IPS screen to be excellent.  Its not quite on par with the Apple Retina display but it puts my Kindle Fire HDX to shame.  I gave it to my kids and let them run a couple of their games and they had no issues with performance.  I think for the price you are getting a pretty good tablet from a well know manufacturer.  Minus catching a higher end Samsung on sale, I don't think youll find a much better deal out there.  If you are shopping around for an Android tablet I would not hesitate to buy this one."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "For the first week the tablet worked great... Then as the frequent updates rolled in the device became less and less stable. It now reboots several times a day (10+). I have tried factory resetting the tablet multiple times as well as not installing any apps that did not come with the tablet and I still have issues. I'm pretty confident the issue is related to the updates being released as the number of reboots changes with the release of each update.\n\nIt's a shame because the tablet works great otherwise, but having it reboot 2-3 times during one session ruins the experience."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "This tablet turned out better than I imagined when it was first offered. Yes it had some quirks (I'll try to list them below), but overall it is lightweight, fast, and very capable. A job well done by ASUS.\n\nFirst of all the form factor, and ascetics seem to mimic a mixture of iPad mini, and the Galaxy Tab, which is a good thing. It has almost the same form factor (i.e: aspect ratio) of the iPad mini, and has a \"fake\" leather texture like the Samsung tablets on the back. The tablet itself is very lightweight even with a sturdy 2K screen. Overall, I would not have complaints in the physical form factor of the device, if it did not have the charging port at the right side, instead of the usual center.\n\nSpeaking of the port, the device has the USB Type-C connector, which is very popular among the recent \"flagship\" devices. It will allow bidirectional access, and will probably cause us to replace all USB micro type connectors we have. It is fast (being USB 3.1), and I even tried to push it. When I connected my USB gaming headset using&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/cheap-OTG-cable/dp/B00XHOGEZG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">cheap OTG cable</a>, it worked. Not only the sound, but the controls worked, ... to a point. It turns out the port does not provide a lot of outgoing power, so I'll need to find a USB OTG hub (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/something-like-this/dp/B00QI6QKCW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">(something like this)</a>. Anyways happy with the initial findings, I went on to try&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/hdmi-output/dp/B0116YDRZI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">hdmi output</a>, however it looks like the port does not support DP signal, this means no video out (except for wifi mirroring).\n\nAccessories is a concern in general for this device. Unfortunately the digitizer pen was not available when I received the tablet for review, and there was little known about compatible accessories (hence my experiments above). I was able to find a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/tempered-glass-screen-protected/dp/B011U99LHM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">tempered glass screen protected</a>, which was not perfect (as it is rated 4 stars here), and I was able to charge it at 2A with my trustworthy USB charger (this is more than the 1.5A charger that came with the box, so do this at your own risk). However I could not find a good folio case / keyboard combo. Yet, of course, it worked well with all the bluetooth devices I threw at it, including headsets, keyboards, etc.\n\nFinally the setup, and the UI is pleasant. It did not ask too many questions (but still could have been shorter), and has a nice battery watching system that will alert you about applications that drain power (for example it complained about a paused Netflix stream, which made sense). Performance wise the Atom chipset is not the fastest out there (there are existing Snapdragon 810 based devices on the market, yet they usually overheat, and even my older OnePlus One was able to beat it in many benchmarks). However when used in real life, I did not experience any sluggishness or stalling. Everything was very fluid. This could be due to a better internal flash storage, or graphics chipset, but still the package together is good performance wise. Also it did not overheat, which is a problem with some latest devices (as mentioned above).\n\nSo the (minor) issues:\n- Pen not available, yet\n- No good folio cover on market, yet\n- No HDMI out (yet?)\n\nGood things:\n- Highly performant\n- Does not overheat\n- Bright, and pleasant screen\n- Lightweight\n- Good amount of memory (4GB RAM + 64GB storage)\n- Large enough battery\n- 4K video recording and nice camera for this form factor\n\nOverall the positives had much more weight for me, compared to the minor annoyances. I'm currently holding on for the digitizer pen arrival, and assuming it would be good I could rate it 5 stars out of 5."}

I required something lightweight so I can casually hold it in weird positions (inc. in bed), possess enough performance to breeze through general home-user tasks (web, Office suite, videos/YouTube), have *great* screens and speakers, and have enough oomph to play the occasional game or two.\nOn a budget.\nI was laughing at my friends a month ago for demanding so much from a budget tablet. Now Ive got the short end of the stick handed to me, on a silver platter with the launch of the Zenpad Z580C.\nMy only saving grace is the fact that like all budget gadgets, this came with some not-negligible compromises.\nThe DAC audibly raises the low-end frequencies (compared to my Dragonfly 1.2). While I do prefer the sound, I believe DAC should add absolutely NOTHING to the sound signal and I hope Asus can included a flatter DAC for future models.\nThe speakers tend to sizzle out on sharp sibilants (like s in sound and st in jest), making them sound harsh and grating to the ear. Then again, my ears are young and sensitive to trebles, so your mileage will definitely vary.\nIve installed Nova launcher to hide most of Zen UI away, but the notification centre is stuck there and its lack of customisation annoys me. Commonly used shortcuts like Wi-Fi and airplane mode take too many drags to access, and the inability to remove the less useful shortcuts makes the notification centre too cluttered for my tastes.\n\nOnto the positives now, and boy there are many.\nThe speakers sound, for a little overstatement, phenomenally good, especially with DTS. These little beauties can go LOUD (max volume) without distortion. Ill have to seriously applaud Asus for forgoing bass quantity on these tiny speakers (its there, but lets not kid ourselves, they're kinda weak) so they can play loud AND clean at the same time. Kudos Asus, kudos.\nThis is also perhaps the first time Ive experienced audio enhancement enhancing audio experience. Movies encoded in 5.1 channels benefit greatly from DTS enhancements, namely improved positioning and punchy effects. Whats also impressive is that the speakers & DTS can handle complex scenes, like climatic and chaotic battle with ease.\nFinally, despite the tablets low-ish benchmark scores, general performance other than gaming is smooth, and very rarely exhibited slowdowns or lags (most likely software glitch than slow hardware). This is for me, the biggest selling point of the tablet  it offers fantastic performance, in addition to the stylish design and fantastic hardware all the while maintaining a budget price tag.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBelow are my benchmark comparisons to the Z580CA (as reported on Anandtech [...])\n\nGoogle Sheets link:\n[...]\n\n(Copy/pasted from my post on Whirlpool)\n'Z580C is % worse' row shows the performance difference compared to the Z580CA.\n'Perf as % of Z580CA' row is simply performance expressed as a percentage of Z580CA.\n\nFrom the data alone, I would argue that there's strong case for spending more money on the Z580CA (or one of the in-between configurations) since there's an almost linear relationship between cost and performance. Even if you don't need the extra performance, the higher end models still have good value propositions in extra features like stylus support, extra RAM and storage space.\n\nOne big negative of the device I've noticed is that it can't maintain constant 30 FPS when playing Asphalt 8 on very low settings, the device would chug along at around 25 FPS. I would describe the game as barely playable as the stuttering can make high speed cornering and maneuvers hard to perform."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "The screen is the same size and resolution and ratio as the iPad Mini 3.  It looks as good.  The thickness is the same.  Both the ipad mini 3 and the Asus ZenPad S come with similar configurations of ram and storage.  The intel proccessor in the Asus is quite fast, and the ipad isn't a slouch itself.  On specs alone it is a virtual tie.\n\nThe choice between them will come down to price, service, and preference.  The Asus ZenPad S is cheaper, so that's a clear win.  Apple service is hard to beat.  iOS vs Android will be debated forever, personally I prefer Android but if you prefer iOS the iPad comes with that.\n\nOverall I'd take this Asus ZenPad S over the iPad mini 3.  It's cheaper and runs Android while being equivalent quality and specs.  Great little tablet."}

The ZenUI allows you to choose the look you want with fonts and icons. The power button gave me some trouble the first few days with where its located and pressing on it seems to be a hassle cause you have to press it just right. But that was fixed when to wake & sleep, all you have to do is double tap the screen twice. It does come with some apps that are useless but I've been able to uninstall those without a root and since last week when I got it, it has updated twice. There is a Asus support app on the tablet for any problems you might encounter and a message board that helps somewhat with the apps that come with it."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "This tablet is an extremely solid product.  Its construction is firm with slender depth and a nice size in the hand.  It's width and height are the same as an iPad Mini2.  Having been, for the last several years, an iPod/iPad/iPhone customer (who still loves the PC over the MacBook, etc.), this tablet gave me my first experience in the Android realm and, altogether, it was positive.  I expect that most of my issues in the Android environment were/are the result of my unfamiliarity with it, but several things are worth pointing out.  Kind of like when you get a Dell computer that runs Windows 7/8/10, there are a bunch of seemingly duplicate features.  For example, this ASUS tablet comes with its own browser AND a Google Chrome browser.  Why the need?  Not sure, but it can lead to some confusion.  In addition, you can log into an ASUS account and a Google account.  Frankly, I'm not sure what the benefit is of the ASUS account, especially since you might have yet another username/password combination to keep track of.  I downloaded a few apps and movies via Google Play and everything worked as expected, i.e. well.  While I am accustomed to the physical home button on the bottom of the iPad mini and phone, I have not quite gotten used to the ZenPad's power/awaken button on the side of the unit, just below the volume control.  All of these issues, however, are minor in the grand tablet scheme, so I won't ding the product for them.  Starting to like it as much as the iPad Mini 2 . . . plus I don't have to deal with that infernal iTunes."}

Annoyed as I was with Apple, I still gave the mini 3 a look, its hard to abandon those itunes purchases, but it's specs were inferior to the ZenPad S8 for half the cost.  The z3850 processor outperforms the A7 significantly  and the asus has 2x or 4x RAM, while other features were comparable.  There are those that would apologize for the underpowered hardware on Apple's new products compared to android tablets and phones saying iOS doesn't need it because it has a better OS, but it only doesn't need it yet and a couple years down the line, you'll update to iOS10 and find you have an obsolete device.\n\nThe ZenPad S 8 is the first in a new generation of tablets by asus, but they have had other lines of tablets I had encountered in work giving them plenty of models to get their feet wet.  The ZenPad has definitely upgraded in the design, screen and camera from their other tablets, the three things that seem to catch peoples eye the fastest.  Asus always seems to have good value in hardware, which I care most about, and I've used their computer components for over a decade.  I wanted the 4gig version of this which doesn't seem available yet and I wanted the case by asus, also unavailable, but I'm sure they will be in time.  I suspect they will get a growing share of the market for tablets and phones with well designed value like this and the ZenFone 2."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "Like many of the other reviewers, I don't have a ton of time with this new tablet.  But, I do like what I see so far!  Let me start with my \"tablet credentials\".  This is my 7th tablet.  I own (or have owned) 1 ASUS Transformer 10\" (sold),  2 Nexus 7 (2012) (one with 16GB and one with 32GB), a B&N Nook HD+ (I just sold that),  a Lenovo Tab A10 10.1-Inch 16 GB Tablet with keyboard, and an HP Slate 7 Extreme.  My 10\" transformer was the original and just too big and heavy, so I sold it and went for the Nexus 7.  I was originally very happy with my Nexus 7 tablets, but as they aged and were upgraded to the latest, greatest, cutting-edge OS's (that's how Nexus works, right?), they got slower and slower and slower.  I tried everything.  Complete wipes, installing custom ROMs (CM), etc.  But, in the end I think they were build with slow memory and couldn't keep up with the new OS's.  (I understand the 2013 model are a little better).  The Nook was my 2nd attempt at bigger (not quite 10\"), but lighter.  It's performance was only ok at best.  Never quick by any measure.  The Lenovo was something I recently won in a raffle and I'm un-impressed with it's performance, display quality and resolution, and bloatware.  It's ok for free, but still not what I'm looking for.  So, I ordered the HP Slate 7 Extreme.  On paper, it was supposed to rock.  But, it got hot, had TERRIBLE battery life and *for me* was still VERY SLOW!  So after all this experience with unimpressive tablets, I started digging to understand why I was such a hard customer to please.  I don't really game much. Hmmm.  You know what it was?  I multi-task a lot!  I run mail and browser (with lots of tabs), and widgets and this and that and I discovered that of all my previous 6 tablets, they ALL had 1GB of RAM!  Turns out my HP Slate 7 Extreme might be fast, but with 1GB RAM it was super slow for me.  Enter the 4GB of RAM Z580CA.  It's smooth, and lots of speed.  No RAM trouble when I run all my stuff!  Display is beautiful, although the auto setting tends to be too dim for me.  The battery life and standby both seem great so far!  The form factor is perfect for me....super super thin and 4:3 is great for me.  I'm also anxious for the Z-pen.  I've got an H9 tempered glass screen protector on it's way because this is a keeper!  I'll update this review in a few weeks once I've got more substantial data, but so far so good!  Great job ASUS, let's hope you sell a ton of these premium tablets!\nUPDATE 8/28/15\nThought that I would quickly update my battery longevity. My Z580CA is finally telling me to re-charge after 5 days! I fully charged it after receiving it on first used it on 8/23. It only got used a few hours here and there, but today on 8/28 I'm at 12% left with a forecast of 12 hours to go. While this may not indicate anything relative to SOT, it does show excellent sipping of battery while on standby. Also, I just got promoted to update my OS, there must be a new one out."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B011TVF5QC", "review": "I really like this tablet, but I'm having some issues that I hope are software problems that can be resolved in the near future.\n\nPros:\n\n1. Screen - the display is gorgeous and high-res.\n2. Form-factor - thin and light.  Some of the edges are a little sharp, but it's not a problem with a case.\n3. Front-facing speakers - easy to hear dialog in videos and pretty good treble/highs. Almost no base, but the speakers are tiny, so not unexpected.\n\nCons:\n\n1. Blur-free motion - no way to disable this; even when set to disabled, I still see the \"soap opera\" effect.  There is a lot of stuttering/judder in videos.  I notice this specifically in Netflix.  When the UI is visible, the video is smooth, but when the controls disappear, the video gets really jerky.  I was also seeing some random video corruption/artifacts every once in a while.\n2. Sound pops/clicks - the audio pops when switching apps or pressing the recent apps button.  For example, if I listen to music and go back and forth between the music app and the home screen, I'll usually get a pop each time.  Also if I press the google voice search button repeatedly, I usually hear a pop just before the sound effect plays.\n3. Hotcool SmartCover puts the table to sleep randomly - when you move the magnet in the front cover around to the backside of the tablet, it'll sometimes turn off the screen.  My guess is that the magnetic sensor needs some tweaking, or it only works for the Asus smart cover.  For now, I have to disable this feature entirely, which is very inconvenient.\n4. Bloatware! - this table comes packed full of bloatware that can't be uninstalled or disabled.\n\nUpdate: Asus released a new update, version 4.1.0, which has fixed the blur-free motion problems I was having in Netflix.  Also the disable setting now correctly disables the \"soap opera\" mode.  Also it looks like after the update, you can disable or uninstall a lot more of the original bloatware without having to root.  Adding 1 more star as the only problems left are with sound pops and smart cover detection."}

I love the form factor, ram, storage, weight, fantastic display and speakers.  I really miss no vibration alerts and Asus should have added the vibration motor on a tablet like this.  The Antutu benchmark is 47,xxx but real world performance is much less.  As much as I love all else about this tablet it will go back unless Asus pushes a patch or I can gain root and delete the TONS of bloatware.

After mailing the tablet it and waiting over 2 weeks I finally get a message from Asus that they have received the tablet. 6 days later I get an invoice for $100 dollars with a message saying the subboard is damaged and not covered under warranty. Now, I can promise you that this tablet was never mistreated in any way, shape or form. I disputed the claim and after about a day received another invoice saying I only had 2 days left to pay my bill or the tablet would be mailed back to me.
