{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "The LeapPad2 is geared towards kids ages 3-9 years old which is perfect for all my girls but especially for Kaila (2.5). She can be a little rough on her toys and I'm always afraid to let her use my iPad since I know it will go flying across the room eventually. We have found the LeapPad to be very durable and can definitely take a beating. It's also very user friendly and my kids were able to figure out how to use it with minimal help from me.\n\nSome of our favorite applications have been the Disney storybooks where you can choose among 3 options - have the entire book read to your child, have to book read page-by-page, have your child read the book. There are also games and activities to keep your child engaged. However, what my girls like the best is that you can record your own voice reading the story and play it back whenever you want. This is a great feature for our family since I travel a lot.\n\nMy kids love the LeapPad2!"}

After a few minutes of play time, the screen would just turn off. I contacted customer service & the employee told me this product can only be used with rechargeable batteries. I purchased rechargeable batteries & that didn't solve the problem. I called back at a later date & a different employee had me insert regular, new batteries. That didn't work, and I explained this issue happens when the power cord is connected. I was offered a free app, but what good is another app if we can't use it!? Leap Frog wouldn't replace it or repair it. I'm unhappy with the customer service I received, and I don't recommend Leap Frog products to anyone I know because of this bad experience!"}

I like the games and the options and I like that the games are interchangeable with the leap pad explorer since we have that also. Some games are really fun for the girls. It also has a stylus for some writing.  And it can keep them occupied when I am busy. They like having their own tablet and it is pretty durable. The games are durable as well. The selection of available games is amazing and you can find something for almost any child. I love the learning components as well. My girls love the camera.\nBut these things eat batteries like crazy. Battery life is only a couple hours so plan to get rechargeable batteries and plug them in pretty much daily. Also you need to plug into the computer to update periodically. Other than that though you don't need to plug this Into the computer Often. It works more like a gameboy than a tablet really."}

The only thing I do not like that they try to make the most money off of you by the learning games when every other game in the universe can be found online for free. I do however wish this item was rechargeable with a cord rather than having to continuously buy batteries, it is very annoying as all the other new game systems have that.

With that said the 3rd tablet hasn't broke yet but it didn't come with the battery pack like my previous purchase. I didn't catch it in time to contact Amazon to notify them they sent the wrong replacement and had to give it to her for xmas. Well 8 batteries and one day later it's still working... Buy costs a fortune to run! Why wouldn't you include the battery pack on all of your products leapfrog? This tablet is useless without it. She can play it for 6-8 hours before its deader than a door nail. Now I have to order a charger and battery pack and wait for it to come all while buying multiple batteries in the meantime. $75 when all said and done!

With a name like LeapPad, we figured we could not go wrong since it's such a trusted name in quality learning children's toys.  Boy were we wrong!  After only 1 day of use, the thing died on us.  So of course we figured, switch out the batteries.  We did this a dozen times with Duracell, Energizer, Rayovac, etc. etc. and even some Walmart brand ones that were originally came with the toy.  None worked.  We also went online to see if we could find some tutorial videos on how to troubleshoot a LeapPad 2 that just refuses to turn on.  We tried holding down the power button with the home button for 10 seconds, then pressing the On button again.  No dice.  We tried hooking up the USB cord to the computer to see if it could take a charge from that source or power on with the LeapPad app.  No luck.  So finally, we returned the device and asked if Walmart could exchange it for one that works.  They did.  And the process repeated.  After 1 day of use, the brand-new LeapPad powered off by itself and refuses to power back on.  After taking it back to Walmart the second time, we were sure there was no way LeapFrog would make 3 defective LeapPads.  Again, we were wrong!!!  After the third and final failed attempt to give our daughter a fun, learning device, we returned the device to Walmart for a full refund and bought her a V-Tech Innotab 3S.  That is our suggestion folks!  Go with V-Tech for a better quality, longer-lasting product this Christmas and for all your other holiday gifting children's needs."}

At age 5 the apps and games make more sense to her of course.  I bought more leapfrog learning apps and she has a great time working on spelling, reading, and math.  Leapfrog makes fantastic learning products, great job!"}

My son absolutely LOVES his LeapPad! He's a bit older now, so we're upgrading to a Kindle Fire 7 with more options for play, but this is still going to be a constant companion and option for him. He can watch movies, play games and he is obsessed with Scout - so this is a staple for roadtrips and anywhere else we need him to be relatively occupied (church, dr office, etc). The Monster theme is pretty cute too and the skin included has stood the test of time and definitely helped with a few minor drops to maintain the integrity of the unit."}

However, one day it's working perfectly fine and the next it won't turn on. Customer service (spoke to first guy, supervisor and then a manager) All said and confirmed that others have called in with the same issue happening. Just won't work one day. We take very good care of it, kids are limited to when they can play it. We were told the clean the battery connection areas, which were spotless anyway, and it still didn't work. They refused to do anything about it other then suggest we buy a new one at full price and they would give us a few apps free. That's just bad business when you have a faulty product. I won't be investing in another one."}

It was either this or the InnoTab and we decided on this. We would much rather her have her own tablet than worry about her stumbling into other apps and paying for things on our iPad Mini. It's safe, educational, durable, and it's quite to respond to touch, which are more pros. The case it came with protects it very well.\n\nThe issues we had with it was that the zipper of the case broke sooner than we expected. Also, as durable as the actually tablet is, the stylus broke too easily as well. My daughter is careful with her things so I was surprised at this. Also, the biggest problem I had was the fact that it isn't rechargeable. I have to keep going to the store to buy batteries for it. There are rechargeable batteries out there, but I didn't think it would need that much juice considering all the batteries it's using up.\n\nOverall, I'm pleased with this product and so is my daughter, which is probably the most important thing, right? :)"}

My son had only liked specific things to watch and could not because LeapFrog did not have those specific characters listed and the apps are way too expensive. Definitely not worth the money, or time. You'll be better off forking up $50 for a Dragontouch 7 Android Tablet. I will never purchase anything from Leapfrog ever again."}

I am not at all happy with LeapPad not standing behind their product. In addition, there is not an option to purchase a replacement screen, you have to buy a new unit."}

The only con is that it takes batteries and they have to be changed every few days. & the wall adapters only work while they're plugged into the wall they do not actually charge them with it. We had to buy rechargeable batteries for them. I love that you get updates about your child's progress."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "We bought this as a third birthday gift for our daughter.  She loves playing games on my iPad so we figured she would love this - and we were totally right!  She only has two games right now (Tangled and Pup Pals, or something like that) and she begs to play them both all throughout the day.  She already knows how to turn this on and use it by herself, which has been great for car trips and independent play while I'm getting things done around the house.  I had read negative reviews about the batteries and battery life but so far we haven't had any issues. I was also a little worried she wouldn't understand how to use the stylus since she hasn't seen one before, but she picked it up so easily and now uses it like a pro.\n\nWhen we bought this, we were deciding between the LeapPad2 and the LeapPad3.  The 2 is much cheaper than the 3 but the 3 has the rechargeable batteries.  Since our daughter is only 3 and not the gentlest on her toys, spending only about $40 on this as opposed to nearly $100 worked better for us.  If you have older children and you think that they'll drain the batteries faster, than it might be worth the extra $60.  The 2 is really perfect for young kids though since it's very durable and on the cheaper side.  We also try to limit her screen time so she isn't allowed to play this that much throughout the day - I think that helps conserve the batteries and may be a reason we haven't had any trouble with them yet."}

Which is the thing at bothers me most. She is constantly changing her name to \"Tjajsmmsmaniiellllllllkkkk\" and putting her grade level way to high.

We gave her some time to get use to it and she got into it.  We love that several kiddos can use it - her cousin sometimes signs in as himself (the kiddos can set up different profiles).  It has a camera which works well to take pictures and movies (both front facing and rear facing).  The stylus is better than I thought, there is a game where she (now that she is three) can trace letters and learn the various ways to create the letters.  She loves to draw, so the little paint program is great to use with the stylus.  You can easily download movies (LeapFrog) but they're great, as well as various e-books.  I really like this tablet for my kiddo and the carrying case is awesome too since it keeps it and up to 6 game cartridges safe.  If you are interested in getting your kiddo something that is easy for them to use and isn't as expensive and delicate as an adult type tablet (like the Ipads or Android of the world), this is the thing for them."}

We also bought two sets of rechargeable Energizer batteries which has saved us TONS of money.  We download apps - they range from about $7 to $25 or a little more.  Love the fact that they are learning while they are playing."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "I would only recommend this to someone with a child who has never broken anything.  If you have a child who likes to help or is independent, you might think twice about the fact that this item is not repairable.  I spent over $211.95 purchasing the leap pad 2 princess bundle and the Disney Super Games Bundle.  Im not sure how much it was for each, but it was less than two years ago.  Apparently now they are way cheaper too, but thats how it goes.  My daughter is in the age group it was designed for, and over the last two years I have purchased numerous games, accessories, and the battery recharger pack.  Unfortunately prior to our vacation she decided to pack the charger in the case with the leap pad, and the screen broke.  I called leap frog to see if I could purchase a replacement screen, or send it some place where I could pay to have it repaired.  They informed me that they dont/wont do that, and that my only option was to purchase a new one.  I think it is absurd to market an item to five year olds that is fragile, and cant be fixed.  I will never purchase another item from them.  Hopefully I can find someone who has one to give all of our stuff for it to, because apparently this has been a huge waste of money.  At this point just spend a little more and get them an ipad mini."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "I bought this for my 18 month old son for Christmas when I found out I was expecting my second child.  He was younger than the suggested age for the product, but he was a pro on the iPad so I figured he would also be able to figure this out quickly.  I was wrong.  This product is not intuitive as an iPad and the different iPad apps out there today for kids.  My son is able to go into Netflix and pick his cartoons to play and also play a wide range of Nick Jr and Fisher Price games - but the Lead Pad games are not very easy to use, it was a big disappointment.\n\nThe first thing I did not like is the log in - every time you have to select a user, many times my son ends up deleting and editing profiles accidentally.  I wish there was a way to bypass thing screen, it is unneeded and just go to the 'home' screen.  The other items I don't like is when you in the drawing app, if you select a color it makes you confirm and click a green check mark - this small item makes it hard for kids to use.  All the iPad games you just pick a color and go, the Lead Pad games could learn a lot from some of the usable apps out there for kids, keep it simple as possible, reduce clicks and put yourself if a young child's shoes.  The games that came with it was a caterpillar game of a maze and a pet or dog game - both proved too difficult for my son to use.  Additional cons are this product is not rechargeable, and is hard to sync.  I ended up struggling since I had a MacBook - they ended up having to ship me a new product - but will say the customer service team is very helpful, just slow to respond to emails.\n\nHe is now 3 and still struggles with the LeapPad games, but is a pro at the iPad and iPad games still.  It makes me nervous to let my son play with the iPad - so I was hoping the LeapPad would be a child version of the iPad - but it is not.  What I ended up doing is just getting one of those killer huge cases for my iPad so it virtually destruction proof and I continue to let him play with the iPad.  I love the iPad for the inexpensive, educational easy to use games.  If I were to do it over I would not have purchased the LeadPad - especially because of the price.  Since it is not a high quality product due to the complex user interface, I would only want it if it was about half the cost due to the amount of time my son uses it, I would rather spend the money on iPad games.  I know that iPad are much more costly, so would recommend that if you were in the position as I was and were debating on getting the leap pad, you might be better off using the money for a sturdy iPad case and games.  But if the iPad is out of your price range, this might be a good alternative at a fraction of the cost.\n\nTo make this product a 5 - I would suggest an over-haul of the UI to make it more user friendly and to take some queues from other easy to use tablet games.  The stylus should also be more sensitive to use on the screen, and an easier way to sync and recharge.  It looks as if the new version does accomplish this.  Also to come with more games, so you don't have to spend a lot of extra money buying games to an already expensive device.  I was disappointed with the lack of standard games it came with.  I think there is the potential for this to be great but needs some more work.  It looks as if the newer version fixes some of these issues, like the battery and syncing.\n\nI also would not recommend the case or plastic cover.  The device is sturdy enough not to need the plastic cover, and the case is hard to use for little hands.  it does not work well it just comes in and out - would be better if it held it in as not to loose the device."}

He has a old smart phone of yours to watch Little Pim videos on and he also has an old netbook that he uses and carries around and old digital cameras.  Since he has been using these things for almost a year with no damage to them I figured the LeapPad would be fine too.  I wanted the LeapPad because the games and activities are well done for kids.\n\n He was just getting to where he could access and play the programs effectively when the screen cracked. I'm not sure how it happened he was watching it read an ebook before bed and it was fine but when I went to get it from his bed after he was asleep the screen was cracked.  I am shocked that this happened.  He plays with electronics that are not designed for kids all the time and has never damaged them.\n\nI think its great too but the glass for the touch screen is very fragile.  I strongly recommend if you purchase any leappad do it directly from leapfrog.com because they provided 12 months of accident protection and will replace the product one time with in that 12 month period if it gets broken."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "I was a huge fan of Leapfrog before we purchased this piece of garbage for my daughter 18 months ago. She had a Leapster Explorer prior and loved it. So we figured we'd get her the new Leappad 2 to keep her ahead of the curve. My biggest complaint about this, for which I contacted Leapfrog, was an obvious design flaw which my youngest daughter brought to my attention.\n\nOn the Explorer, the stylus is flared towards the end. It seems minor but this doesn't allow the stylus to get far enough into the cartridge slot to damage the pins. The thinner stylus on the Leappad2, allowed my 3 year old to get the sylus down into the slot and bend pins. When I contacted Leafrog on this issue, they informed me the device was no longer under warranty since I hadn't purchased it on line. They wanted to hear nothing about a potential way to improve their product. No help from the company on this one. I was able to pull out a pick set and reset the pins which I've had to do twice.\n\nOverall, the quality on this seemed to be poor for the age range. The Explorer is still in use today and tanking along. The Leappad2 is on the sidelines with twice repaired cartidge pins, a cracked screen and numerous glitches in many games which aren't resolved by any combo of updates or wipe and rebuilds of the device. Couple that with a clunky interface which needs to be installed on PC/MAC and this is nightmare for parents to handle.\n\nThe most disappointing thing is the Leapfrog products demand a premium price. They want to the be the Apple of the kiddie set, but they simply don't have the customer service chops or intuitiveness to even think about being in that space.\n\nAt this stage of the game, I'd strongly suggest parents steer well clear of this beta product and turn their attentions to the products offered by V-Tech, Nabi, Samsung and even the 7 inch Kindle Fires and IPads in addition to the the newer Leapfrog products . There is a wide array of products currently out there which would be a better alternative to this half baked money grab."}

My 6 year old barely touches his leappad and my 3 year old only uses the MP3 app.  One of the leappads screens broke within the first year and leapfrog replaced it.  Both have the rechargeable leappad batteries and they no longer hold a charge.  This toy is quite the investment.  It would have been more cost effective to purchase a Kindle Fire or something comparable.  At least with that the apps would be a lot cheaper and there would be a larger library of books to download.  I would not recommend purchasing this product."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "I bought two of these for my five and six year old- the Princess pack for my daughter and the Monsters Inc pack for my son. Couple of things I didn't know going in- the Monsters Inc pack comes with a gel skin, and the Princess pack comes with a case, which includes slots for games. The case is great, but my son felt a little left out when he realised that his LeapPad didn't have one. This was my bad, I should have read the items' descriptions better.\nEach LeapPad2 requires 4 AA batteries to run. I bought an 8-pack of Energizer rechargeable batteries for these systems, assuming they'd need charging every week or so. Nope- the first day within an hour of play both systems shut down, out of juice. The second day, after a full recharge of the batteries, my son's shut down within fifteen minutes. I switched out the batteries, and he had another 20 minutes of play before again, the batteries were drained. My daughter's lasted half an hour. This last week they've lasted half an hour's play at most before the batteries are dead. This is devastating to my children, who get very excited to have an opportunity to play with their games only to have them shut down in the middle of a game or project. My daughter has ended up crying most days when her system shuts down in the middle of her art project or picture taking. This is upsetting for me as well, since I wanted this to be a positive, educational experience for them. I thought it would be a nice, healthy treat for them, augment their studies in a fun way, but instead they come out disappointed and I am as well.\nI ended up buying a 24 pack of batteries, but when they're gone I intend to trash the systems. I am very disappointed. Would not buy again, would not recommend."}

It's still aggravating to do that whenever I have to set up one of those devices, but at least the end user doesn't have to deal with that anymore.\n\nBut at least when Apples updates iTunes people can still connect their devices to it.\n\nThat is *not* the case with LeapFrog connect. Maybe people who are true experts with port settings and who can really dig down in their computer and make it jump through hoops could get it to work, but I couldn't after following every FAQ on the site. I have a fair amount of computer competency, I've been to device manager before, have used cmd to accomplish things, have helped countless people connect to printers and network drives.\n\nBased on the people I've helped with computers, all very smart people who just aren't quite as knowledgeable about computers as I am, most people will not be able to get their device connected if it doesn't connect the way it's supposed to. The way our device connected right out of the box. The way it connected a month after we bought it before they changed the installer program. I don't know why LeapFrog changed their Connect program. (I don't know why it didn't just prompt for an admin log-in instead of saying to log completely out of the computer and back in again either, incidentally.) I think it was an bad move on LeapFrog's part and turned a 4 star item to a 1 star item.\n\nThere's a lot of potential in the device, the apps we were able to put on it before this fiasco are great, the battery life isn't that great if you're used to charging your devices (seriously, if you want a LeapPad2 get the one with the AC power pack adapter, totally worth the money even if you only ever get to download one batch of games.)"}

With only the basic games and apps that come with the game, he picked up on the games very quickly and was not only singing the abc's, but knew their sounds and could recognize letters outside of the  game. He could also sing along to all of the songs and didn't want to put it down. We bought other apps for the LeapPad2 and he picked up on those just as easily.

Some of the added games are a little tough for my daughter but she still enjoys playing the preloaded ones. I definitely recommend buying the rechargeable battery pack. We did not and I'm kicking myself. We use rechargeable batteries but they aren't the same. The stylus is connected which is great because they are easily lost.

While the games are engaging and he loves the Leap Pad, the screen has completely stopped responding to touch (exactly after 12 months which the Leap Pad 2 only comes with a 12 month warranty). We contacted Leap Frog and they told us there is nothing they can do - they can't fix it and they won't replace it.\n\nI caution against purchasing the product given the fact that with light usage, the screen has completely stopped responding and LeapFrog will not help in any manner once the warranty is over."}

I spoke with several different people at Amazon, one who said they were delivered, one who said they were lost, and one who said they were never shipped.  I did get a refund, but had to scramble the week before Christmas to get them at a MUCH higher price.\nBut---my kids love them.  They love taking pictures, using them as music players, playing the games that come with it, as well as the cartridges we bought them.  They also seem to have a relatively long battery life so far.  Even our 8 year old son will put down his Nintendo DS to play this with his 4 year old sisters."}

It should seriously come standard with a rechargeable pack. (To buy that separately is another $50, which I think is outrageous since I bought my sons for $30 2 years ago).\nBut the game itself is awesome. The apps are a little pricey, but my now 4 year old still plays with his 2 hours later. My 18 month old got it for Christmas and loves to watch tv shows as well as jam to his favorite songs. As he gets older he will just grow into it."}

I use only name brand batteries and yet as soon as they get down to \"good\" on a tester, the device will not work correctly and requires brand new, fresh batteries be installed.  Yes we're going to bite the bullet and buy rechargeable batteries or the OEM power pack eventually, but you would think LeapFrog would find a way to either implement a better power source or make the unit more energy efficient."}

They are better on this than grandma is on her computer.  I think they would play these games all day if they were allowed!  (which they're not!)  Kids still need other more rigorous activities!

They absolutely love it and I especially loved that it came with a $20 gift certificate to use for apps. It's easy for them to use, and they learn SO much with it so I love that. They love it to. Overall, I am very glad we got it.\n\nHere are the issues we have:\n-It's not rechargeable. We have to put 4 AA batteries in it and it goes through the batteries extremely fast. In the first 2 days, the batteries were dead. We ended up getting rechargeable batteries for it but I was really disappointed that this particular version didn't come with the ability to recharge it. Other ones I've seen do so it didn't occur to me that it wouldn't.\n-Like I said, it sucks up batteries very quickly. It makes us crazy!\n\nWhat we like:\n-The camera. Oh my goodness, the kids just LOVE the camera! They love being able to take pictures.\n-The fact that the apps are geared towards education.\n-The music. We got a princess music app with several of their favorite songs and they love being able to listen to music on their own.\n\nYes the apps are expensive, but I look out for coupon or deals that leap pad has right there on the website. I bought 5 apps right after we got it and saved 30%. So if you keep your eyes open, you can get deals. They're definitely more expensive than apps bought for tablets but I feel that it's worth it because they're created by educators and aimed totally at educating."}

Nothing works on the device at this point. Still waiting for response from Leappad before giving a full review. Update on 2/23/2014. After receiving an email from customer service saying that they would see what they could to to help if I filled out the requested personal information, I sent them the requested info and never received a reply of any kind after several months of waiting. I have sent them several emails which have all been ignored. I bought 2 Kindles at the same time as this product, which still work great to this day. The kindle cost a little more, but is well worth it. Also, keep in mind that it will cost you an arm and a leg to supply your Leappad with any kind of entertainment. Every app costs money, and most are obsolete to your child within 24 hours. You have countless free apps you can get with a Kindle, so the savings in apps alone with pay for the difference in costs in no time at all. Also, be aware that this product takes double A batteries, so you will spend a fortune on batteries as well (either rechargeable or regular). Kindles recharge on their own internal battery and can be played while charging. There really is no redeeming value in a Leap pad, so I would higher recommend against them. No customer service, bad product, AA batteries, cheaply made screens, expensive apps. Do yourself a favor, and get something else, I wish I did."}

Don't waste your money when there is far better technology and selection available ... unless you are also buying your kid haribo sugarless gummy bears, in which case this product is for you."}

This was in three different emails.\nDo not buy this unless you want something that if a child accidentally brakes it it can not be fixed. There are no replacement screens for it. I now have 4 other grand kids that would like more games, as I was planning on buying, but will not buy any more as they could be of no use if they break their screen. My 4 year old grand son was so sad when he found out the company had no way of having his game fixed. Just be aware that if the screen breaks you will have no way of having it repaired and no support at all from LeapFroag support as their policy is to sell you something that is delicate for children and have no parts for it.\n\nUpdate::: I have calmed down a bit and because of the cartridges and my grandson loved the toy I bought him another one. It is a good educational toy and the kids love it. Just wish there was a way to fix the screen when it brakes... It is very educational...so buying another one was the best thing to do for him..."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "I got two LeapPad 2 bundles for Christmas, one for each of my two daughters.  When I connected the LeapPads to my computer to set them up, one of them received Calendar, Clock, Notepad and Calculator apps, and the other one did not.  All indications on the LeapFrog web site were that I could share these apps between two LeapPads, but I couldn't figure out how, so I contacted their customer service.  I was informed that only one of my LeapPads came with these apps and they were licensed for a single LeapPad only, so I would have to pay for them on the other device.  Well that's not great, but I wanted to make my daughter happy so I headed to the LeapFrog store to get those apps.  As it turns out, EACH of those apps costs five incredible dollars.  Yes, that's right! A clock app, practically the \"Hello World\" of mobile apps, is a whopping five dollars for the LeapPad.  By comparison, there are about 50 billion free Clock apps for the Android platform.\n\nNow, kids couldn't care less how much their apps cost.  So if I were reviewing this for a 3 year old, I'd give it more stars.  But since the parents are the ones actually buying into this marketing scheme of a tablet, I figure it's fair to note that LeapPad apps appear to have a roughly 10,000 percent markup on equivalent apps for the Android or even iOS platforms.  By the way, if you think iTunes is awful for syncing your mobile devices with your PC, wait until you get a load of the \"LeapFrog Connect\" app.  Its functionality is so limited that it's a wonder that it fails at implementing even that limited functionality.\n\nI see some reviews are giving the LeapPad more stars because \"oh it's so kid friendly, it doesn't come with a web browser or wireless connectivity or anything like that.\" Well, seriously? You're going to give a device credit for intentionally not having basic mobile functionality? Just because it comes with a web browser doesn't mean you have to set it up to auto-connect to unsecured wireless networks and preload TMZ or whatever trashy web site.  Notice that when Amazon decided to market its Kindle Fire as a tablet for kids, it did so with \"Kindle Freetime,\" a system that restricts which apps and features can be used and includes things like usage timers (not on the leappad! probably because it would cost an additional fifteen dollars or something.) Amazon did not choose to introduce a \"Kindle Offline\" device that didn't come with wireless or a web browser.  That surely would have been ridiculed.  I can understand why LeapPads don't come with those features (since it would be hard for LeapFrog to maintain their walled garden of exorbitantly priced apps) but don't try to tell me that those missing features are a plus.\n\nIn summary, unless you have either an iron will to ignore your child's pleas for more apps, or deep enough pockets to cough up money for every little thing, you should probably just get a more mainstream tablet."}

We paid a good price for this but found toys are us dropped theres $20 a few days after we purchased it on Amazon.  The difference though, we didn't have to fight the people and crowds. All our purchases through amazon came in a very timely manner."}

I bought this for my son who is two and try to down load some apps for it took me three days just to get one and I had to leave my computer running day and night for it to keep loading. I contacted cust service and they said it should take from 30 minutes to 3 hrs. whoo will like to wait three hrs for an app to load.. plus I waited three days not three hrs, for the, price you can get something better and faster. I returned this useless thing and got him a tablet much faster and easier to deal with when down loading apps online.."}

So the only thing I can say against them is that they are NOT drop-resistant. My boys got them when they were just over three years old and grew into loving them quickly. The use them almost every day and they are great for car trips. I think they will keep using them for about another year or so (until they are 5 or 6) and then I will get them a real tablet. So you will get a few years out of them. Games are about $20 - $25 each and have a good selection online and in cartridges. Definitely recommend them for small kids. It's a good learning tool as well."}

They give you partial free programs with the choice to upgrade, for a price.  But they have good child safety guards on there so a young child cannot order them on there.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "Here is what I have to say about the leap pad 2.  My three year old got it for Christmas.\n\nPROS:\n\nShe has dropped it several times and it is still going strong, so for durability, so far so good.\n\nIt has a little stylus attached to it, which my daughter uses and likes.  I like that it is attached, otherwise by now it would be lost.\n\nIt is an educational toy.\n\nCONS:\nIt uses batteries.  4 AA batteries.  The first set lasted about 3 days before I had to replace them.  (buy them before because they are not included).  The battery life was actually longer than I expected it to be.\n\nThe pre-loaded apps leave a lot to be desired.  Why can't they at least give a doodling app or something uncomplicated like that?\n\nTo add apps you must connect it to your computer.  Let me just say I did this and, no joke, it took well over an hour, probably close to 2 hours to set it up, make an account.  Install the updates, then install the apps.  I was quite annoyed that it took so long.\n\nALSO BEWARE that the apps are not like apps on your iphone or kindle.  These apps cost $5-$25.  I was kind of shocked to see the Disney apps for $25 (which of course if the ones my child pointed out)  lol.  I did find out however that Amazon does sell a gift card for these apps that can save you a little cash ($14.99 for a $20.00 gift card).  You can also find promotional codes for the site to save also.  However, I would not have purchased this knowing there were NO free apps, no 99 cent apps, only apps that were mostly $10 and $25.  To me that was a little more than I expected.  However if I would have realized it ahead of time it may not have bothered me so much and I might have bought the gift card to go with it.&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/B004Z7H2EQ/dp/B004Z7H2EQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">B004Z7H2EQ</a>&nbsp;There is the link for the gift card.  Looks like the price is currently higher than it was last time I looked at it but as we all know prices can change at anytime on Amazon.\n\nOther notes:\n\nI am not disappointed that I bought this, but I don't think I would buy another one.  I will let my girl have her fun with it until it cannot go anymore.  I went to the store and bought a large pack of batteries.  On the bright side my daughter loves it.  She calls it her special ipad and she is very proud to have a touch screen something like everyone else older in the house has.  It was by far not a bad purchase, I just wish I would have known beforehand the things I am now sharing with you."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "I was really excited with my parents gave this to my 3.5 year old for Christmas.  I got it set up the next day and downloaded a couple games online.  Today my parents returned it to the store for a refund.  Here's why:\n\n1.  I was shocked at how expensive the games are: $5 was the cheapest game I found and it was just a 5 minute book that wasn't written very well.  I don't understand how they can charge so much for these games.  Most games on the app store are $1.99 and are more fun than these games.  I have several on our IPAD that were FREE that are more fun and educational than these games.\n\n2.  The screen is tiny and unresponsive.  I can't get used to it after having the Ipad.  It is very hard for my 3.5 year old to use the tiny little stylus which is about the size of a half of a chop stick.  The screen is  \"touch screen\" but you have to continuously jab the thing to get it to work.  No wonder I've read so many reviews of the screen breaking!\n\n3.  It doesn't recharge.  This was the most shocking thing about it.  We put fresh batteries in it (not included) on Wednesday evening.  By Friday it was flashing the \"dead battery\" sign.  So it worked for maybe 6 hours on 4 double A batteries.  Are you kidding me?  I plugged it into the computer with the USB cord the night before thinking it had some sort of internal rechargeable battery (like EVERYTHING ELSE ELECTRONIC these days besides really cheap toys) and it did nothing.  This was the main reason we are returning it.  I found a rechargeable battery pack on amazon for $40.  That's half the cost of the product itself!  Obviously leapfrog realizes that the batteries are a problem but they're too cheap to create a product that will actually work for more than 6 hours.\n\nMy mom just came to return it and my son didn't even care that she took it back.  Overall a huge waste of money.  Buy a few more games for your Ipad instead."}

My husband and I have iPads that they use and I wanted them to have something of their own while still preserving their childhood (i.e. not getting them a grown up tablet).  I knew the LeapPad was appropriate for my 4yo but I agonized over whether it was too juvenile for my 7 yo despite the age range going up to 8 or 9.  My 7yo really enjoys it so far.  Granted, he has only had it for 4 days but he really does like it.  Even my 10 yo son has picked it up and played with it.\n\nThat said, I wish they made more games for older kids.  There are some for ages 5-8 but that range doesn't seem right.  A lot of learning takes place between the ages of 5 & 8 so a game for an 8yo should be too hard for a 5 yo and an 8 yo would breeze through a game for a 5 yo.  I really wish there were apps and games for 7-9 year olds.  My 7 yo has enjoyed the games for \"older kids\", but we downloaded one yesterday and he completed every level the same day.  He is still playing it but it is not challenging.\n\nI do not regret purchasing one for my 7 yo because it was a good price and if I had only purchased one, the 4 yo and 7yo would be fighting over the one.  If I were only buying one for an older child, I would do so with the understanding that it will be fun but not very challenging."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "When I buy a child tablet, I expect several easy to use apps right off the bat. This starts with almost nothing. The most useful app I've seen is the letter tracing - which is over sensitive.\n\nOnce hooked up to a PC with the leapfrog app installed, and you go through the process of entering your personal information (WHY?) more regular apps will download.\n1 - The leapfrog application requires administrator access. That's fail imo right there. Personal information is again something I don't like to put everywhere - I see why they want it, but the reason for having it is also lame - more on the why later.\n2 - leapfrog app is not cross platform. If they were to write a JAVA based app, it would work on the PC, MAC, Linux, and other systems too.\n\nHere's what you get after all this\nCamera - still and video + cheesy effects on stills\nMy Stuff - An easy explorer for pictures videos, drawings and stories.\nBooks - No books come free. It's empty. THAT is WEAK. Gutenberg is FREE!\nMusic - 5 kiddie songs\nCalendar - A slow response calendar. The day, date, and month is stated in english before switching to the day's notes. A couple lines are provided, nothing about time, no alarm nada. It's \"easy\" for a kid to click on, but I don't see it being more helpful for them that something more functional.\nSneak Peeks - This is eye candy to get your kid to beg you to spend money on apps...\nPet Pad - a virtual pet - one of the minigames here involved tracing letters.\nCalculator - a VERY basic Calculator.\n\nI get that developers need to make money, but this is insanely weak. The screen is low resolution, so the text isn't as clear as it could be. The resistive touch is just passable. They could go capacitive with a pen as well, no need for wacom. The lack of apps isn't the most disturbing aspect though. It's the cost of apps. The tablet itself is $100, but the apps are up to $25, with bundles approaching $80. Now, what reason is there to stick with a poorly developed system like this when you can get an android tablet, and fill it with free kiddie games, or at least, FAR FAR cheaper and much more through applications?\n\nSo here's why they want your personal information. The leapfrog \"app market\" is their money maker, so they need to verify you. I'm not sucker enough to spend money here. The vtech tablets of old weren't this bad.\n\nAssuming you bought this tablet for $80, and spend $7.50 on a measly 6 games, you'd have spent $125 and your kid will get bored relatively quickly. An Asus memo HD7 (pretty much the level of a 2012 nexus 7) is $129 - gives you full android, so fill it up with kiddie apps. My 3 year old kid is able to use android tablets and IPADs just fine - that includes opening kiddie apps, closing it, using netflix to play what she wants etc. So why would she like the simplistic tablet presented? well the interface is colorful, and she likes that about it, but the limited apps get her bored fast - and in her words, she asked for a \"real tablet\".\nAlso, with android, amazon's market gives a free app daily, and google's market gives 15 minutes to return an app if your kid doesn't like it.\n\nI'm left with a tablet that gives my kid a camera (the most fun part for her) and a virtual pet. That's what 80 get us. That sucks. Save your money, get an android tablet, nice thick case, or just the kiddie nabi tablet."}

Here are the pros and cons that we've noticed:\nCons\n1) Registration and download process (setting up LeapFrog) was not very easy (took a good 4 to 5 hours) and lots of this was time spent on the leapfrog website trying to figure out why my downloads weren't registering on the leapfrog even though the computer and unit were connected. And if you want the free Creativity Art app and other free Game app, you HAVE to complete this process.\n2)ADDITIONAL APPS: EXPENSIVE AND NOT VERY USER FRIENDLY. For the money I spent ($60) I would have expected that instructions would have been included on how to purchase and use additional Apps. They weren't. Tried using \"Help\" option on LeapFrogs website, which didn't help. When you purchase additional apps, they send you an email with a 9 or 10 digit code, and then you have to go back to the Leapfrog website (again, lots of going back and forth) and register your code to use the Apps (once your unit is connected to your computer).\n3) Speaking of additional apps, they are expensive. I bought three additional apps and spent $15.\n4) BATTERIES ARE NOT INCLUDED WITH THE UNIT: For $60, they should have included rechargable batteries. BTW- I HIGHLY recommend rechargables vs. regular batteries, if your child uses the leapfrog as much as mine does.\n5) Unit does not come with a screen protector, which I've already asked my husband to purchase. Definitely needed.\nPROS\n1) Son loves it and plays with it NON STOP. He's already started using some of the vocabulary from the games. He LOVES it!\n2) Nice and sturdy unit and pen is easy to use.\n3) Took a little time for him to figure out how to operate, but now that he's used to it, he LOVES it and seems very comfortable with using it.\n\nOverall , I gave it three stars."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "I purchased this as a Christmas gift this year for my 4 year old son.  I am computer savvy and own a PC laptop, a iPad and iPhone.  I was looking forward to owning a kid-friendly tablet that would be safe, straightforward and easy to use.\n\nConnecting and registering and getting Leapfrog Connect to recognize the tablet was a 2 1/2 hour odyssey.  I had to restart and try connecting and disconnecting several times.  He's played with it for 3 days now very happily and today I bought 2 additional apps online from Leap Frog.  Again, a huge to-do of at least 45 minutes to download two freaking apps.  I had to uninstall Leap Frog Connect and re-install it to get it to recognize my son's tablet and switch browsers (I was using chrome at the beginning, then switched to explorer).  Then when the apps FINALLY downloaded, only one successfully installed and a I received a bizarre message to \"try again later\" because the second app wasn't authorized for download or some such nonsense.  I waited a few minutes and tried again and finally got it installed.\n\nI am supremely unimpressed with the user experience for the parent so far.  I know that every company can't be Apple, but it shouldn't take over 2 hours to get a tablet registered and it should NEVER take more than 10 minutes to download some apps you just purchased.  I am dreading purchasing other apps and wasting another hour of my life I can't get back downloading these programs.\n\nOne more gripe and I'm done for now: Leap Pad2 does not provide any icon that alerts you to battery life.  So knowing how many hours of play that may be left on a charge is a complete guessing game.  And goodness knows that unpredictable access to a toy is so convenient.  C'mon Leap Frog.  Really?"}

I do advise people to buy other tablets were you will have different not expensive apps, as an example you can buy I-pad, and trust me, you will see that I am right. So, lets say, you bought this device for $85, then you spend on just one application $30, but in a long run you will need at least 8-10 apps, and as a result you spend $300 on this device.

I am writing this review after spending nearly 2 hours with customer service, with them unable to explain why the $5 app I purchased was not syncing to my device.  However, they refused to refund me $5 even though I never got the app and they wasted hours of my time.  They say they have an absolute no refund policy  NO MATTER WHAT.  Tells you what kind of company you are dealing with.  Also, FYI, my son loves to draw, by they have virtually no art apps.  Like half a dozen, most of which involve tracing letters or shapes, and are totally redundant.  And they all cost like $20.  So whatever you think you save on the purchase of this cheap kids tablet, you will spend on apps since they start at $10 and go past $20.  You may as well spend $100-$200 more for an iPad or Android tablet where you can get literally dozens or hundreds of art apps, learning apps, ,etc, many for free, and others for a buck or two, and much higher quality,  This thing is both a time and money pit, and the company lacks decency or scruples and should be avoided like the plague."}

My child can now already write the entire ABC's due to the help of LeapPad's Pet Pals app.  The leappad keeps my child entertained and engaged.  A lot of the apps and games are wonderful!\n\nPROS:\nEducational\nFun\nEntertaining\nOverall fantastic\n\nCONS:\nNot extremely durable\nGlitches at times\nGames are over priced\nChild gets addicted to wanting it 24/7 (Not really a LeapPad problem, per se)\nThe LeapFrog Connect software you connect it too is HORRIBLE\n\nThe bad part about the LeapPad2 is that it is not excessively durable.  My cousins daughter broke hers, and my child has dropped it a few times and now sometimes the pad will randomly shut off.  While I understand that the products are not invincible, I feel as though LeapFrog could have made a better casing.  Occasionally, the LeapPad glitches.  Most electronics do.  The games are usually extremely overpriced.  I always wait until the games go on sale before buying them.  And finally, my biggest issue, is that the leapfrog software you must use when you connect the leappad2 to the computer (called \"Connect\") is AWFUL.  It is incredibly slow, and consistently freezes.  I almost always have to try and download and app 4 or 5 times before it actually downloads.  It is a pain in the butt!  Hopefully, LeapFrog will upgrade that soon.  That's the main reason for 4 instead of 5 stars.  Overall, for the 79.99 I paid for the pad, I am happy with what it has to offer my child."}

To me, that is what's best about this tablet. It grows with him. I do think the games are little expensive ($25), but then he does get a lot of use out of them.  While he still wants to play with my Kindle, having his own tablet has really saved the wear and tear on the Kindle.  The other day he dropped it onto our hardwood floors while standing up.  It was perfectly fine, and that's not the first time he dropped it.  After a year of use and several dropping incidents it still works without fail.\n\nIt's convenient to be able to download games onto it from online.  My son was able to view the choices with me and decide what new game he wanted.  I even had him take the $25 out of his money jar to pay for it himself.  He loves that game, and is excited to tell everyone that he paid for it with his own money.\n\nThe interactive books are okay, but he still prefers that I read to him (I'm glad).\n\nI do wish the pictures it takes were of a higher quality, but he still enjoys taking pictures.

We recently purchased three of these units (for Christmas 2013), but one of them was defective! It would not power on, no matter what we did! We tried new batteries and the Leapfrog AC adaptor, both of which fully powered the other two identical LeapPad 2s. Thus the 1 star rating.\n\nHowever, when you get a working unit, this baby is awesome! We love that we can purchase cartridges or download the apps from the Leapfrog website via our home computer. Especially convenient for our family is that a single app purchase will go onto three devices (unless it's the free app included with the device). The content is kid friendly, the games adjust to your child's abilities (within the range stated) and with both familiar characters like Disney, Thomas the Train, and Hello Kitty, plus the Leapfrog crew, there are many options to appeal to a variety of kids.  We have an emerging reader and two preschoolers- they all enjoy the Leapster Explorer, and we love that (almost all) the green cartridges work in both game systems!\n\nThe previous models of the Leapster 2 have been fantastic for road trips and everyday use.  When I tested some of the apps on the new LeapPad 2, I saw a definite improvement in the graphics, and the games appear to have extended content compared to the older Leapsters.

It is now a year later and he still plays with it, although the string that holds the stylus broke about 3 months ago. I recommend buying the download card on Amazon for $15 for a $20 card. The games are pricey, in my opinion. You can get games for $5 and $7.50 and $10, but the real good games are $25, like Jake and the Neverland Pirates and Monsters University or Cars. You can get games or videos like Caillou or Max and Ruby or Team Umizoomi Zoomi, to take on the road with you. Most games/videos you can just download, so you don't have to worry about losing the cartridges. I think this is awesome. This has a forward and rear facing camera and video, which is fun!  The quality is not great, but it's for kids. They came out with a newer product, but this one is great as far as I'm concerned. I haven't compared the two."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "My daughter received this Leap Pad 2 as a Christmas gift from her grandparents last year when she was 2 1/2.  The games were a little over her head at the time so we only brought it out occasionally because she would get frustrated with the games quickly.  Just around the time she turned 3 in August, we took it out of the backpack we were storing it in so she could play it while her brother was at an activity, the battery was low and died almost immediately.  A day or two later we replaced the batteries but it still wouldn't turn on.  Unfortunately I could not find the receipt so I put the leap pad on a shelf and forgot about it.  I just found the receipt yesterday as I was unpacking Christmas decor and I was thrilled - I immediately sent a message to Leap Frog explaining the problem.  Customer service has refused to replace or repair our Leap Pad 2 because it was purchased in October so the 1 year warranty was up.  My in-laws always shop very early because they live in a small town and have to travel to a larger centre to shop.  Even though the product was purchased in October, my daughter received it as a Christmas gift and it was played with VERY minimally for around 8 months before it stopped working.  I think Leap Pad should do the right thing and repair or replace my product but after e-mailing back and forth they have said that they will not.  I am SUPER disappointed in their refusal to stand behind their product and I will definitely not be purchasing a replacement or any other Leap Frog products ever again."}

Great selection of apps. I downloaded like..6 or more games/shows for $20. They had a selection my toddler would like.

He had a Nabi before this that went for a swim in the bathtub with him and I wasn't completely impressed with the Nabi so I tried the LeapPad. It only comes with a few games and you have to purchase the rest. This is still a great buy because he is learning instead of just playing games. The games can be selected according to his age range. He is a 3-5 year level and they go up from there when it is time to move onto more advanced games.\nI highly recommend purchasing the battery recharging kit because it uses up batteries quickly. I also ended up getting the gel skin because it protects form drops. I purchased the carrying case for the protection of it as well but he can manage his cartridges and change them out when he wants to switch. The total cost after paying for the tablet itself ended up being $130 for the skin, carry case, battery charger and 3 games. This all ended up being cheaper than the Nabi itself and I am very happy with this purchase!"}

It has been very durable as well. I bought the gel skin for added protection because my 4 year old is prone to dropping things and it has held up well. One suggestion would be to make the ac adapter includee with the device rathere than selling it as an optional accessory. This thing consumed batteries like crazy, even the exspensive extra strength.

We own the Leapster Explorer and the first Leappad for comparison.  This is based off my 8, 6, and 4 year olds experience with the Leappad Ultra\nThe first thing about the Ultra i loved is the size!!! The screen is so much later then what we are used to on the Leapster Explorer or the first leappad.  The graphics are right, sharp and clear! All three of my kids love to use the camera to record plays and songs they put on and gather around the screen to watch them!\nThe battery being rechargeable is amazing.  We have the battery packs for our Leapster explorers but our Leappad one never had that option, I would have to use Duracell rechargeable batteries and remove and reinsert them each time was quite a hassle with the case that was on it as well. Its quick and easy to plug in and it seems the battery life lasts quite a while.\nMy kids are in love with the improvement on the camera and the built in apps.  My kids love singing the punctuation song and the other jingles!\nWe probably won't ever use the wifi but I love that I can turn the wifi off with a parent log in to control the kids ability to get on the internet on a screen they cant get into!\nThe best part is that the pen is attached to Leappad Ultra!!! I cant count how many times we lost the pen on the first one however the ultra has its own pen compartment like the explorers do!\nWe love this Ultra and the kids in our neighborhood that have played with it as well love it! It feels very much like a tablet and is great to use!"}

They use my wife's Samsung tablet all the time now and are used to how much they can do on that.\n\nI ended up getting the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 kids edition for them. Basically a standard Tab 3 with child friendly features like an interface for kids which the parents can control what apps the kids can play and a timer on how many hours they can spend each day on the device (saves a lot of arguing). You can switch between the kid's interface and the regular table interface at any time.\n\nAmazon has the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 Kids Edition here.

It doesn't recognize my Leap pad 2 and says I need to install software.  I get this a lot.  If batteries are running close to empty it can't transfer info.  Those are the only negative things I have seen.  Other than that...I really love the Leap Pad 2.  Both my kids love sharing it too.  We have the Leapster Explorer too  and the Leap pad 2 is much nicer.  The screen is a decent size. The camera works front and back.  The touch screen is easy to use.  I like the Leap Pad products over regular tablets because I find leap games to be more educational than most of the free apps you can download. Once my child reaches 9 or maybe 10, they will outgrow Leapfrog.  :( As many of the games are geared for ages 3-7 with some going to age 8 and 9.

I worked retail for a good 8 years and never have I seen such dreadful service.  Being a childs product, its naturally going to be dropped and what not, cant avoid it.  Well after only 3 months of having it, my son was running to me to show me something, tripped, and when the Leappad fell it cracked the screen. In doing so, the touch screen was no longer usable.  I called Leappad (as it was past Amazons return window) to see how they could help; not only were they not sympathetic, but proceeded to tell me that because the screen was cracked it voided the warranty they do have (whatever that is) and they do not replace it. So I asked if there was an additional warranty they offer that would cover something like this, because like mentioned, its a childs product, its going to get dropped, and they told me no.  So I asked what happens now and they said you buy a new one. Not a joke.  They want you to spend ANOTHER $60-80 (depending on if you get it during a sale) and buy a brand new one. I was throughly disgusted at not only the service but the friendliness of the staff on the phone.\n\nIf I had known all this, I might have gone with an iPad mini or something because to me that just portrays a money hungry, greedy company."}

This is the worst thing i could have bought for my kids. The battery life is extremely poor. The hardware on the device is terrible. I will never purchase another item from leap pad again. Huge waste of money. You literally are changing the battery everyday. I thought that this would be a great investment but was wrong. I would not recommend to any one."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "I bought this as a gift for my daughter almost a year ago. I have a leappad 1 as well to compare the products as well. My daughter is now 4 1/2 and this is still a great toy. You can buy apps/movies/music online or buy game cartridges. And there are so many different types of activities from learning to write letters to creating artwork or solving math problems. After a year the toy still runs well with no broken parts. My daughter chewed up her stylus and it's less accurate but is entirely her fault. My kids have a total of 20 games cartridges (so far that doesn't yet include the new games for this holiday season!)and several app downloads. I haven't experienced a bad game yet.\n\nPros: The learning path! This is the best feature ever! It works only when you plug in the leappad to a computer but it's a wonderful learning tool. It shows you how well your kid is doing at the games, what they are learning, and games that will improve skills.  It breaks down the learning into categories like science, math, reading, social studies, etc. Kids get shooting stars when they excel. It will show you how long the kids play their games and percentages of the questions answered correctly. My daughter's favorite game has been Tangled and she learns a lot from it. I can see how she needs to work on certain words with for instance the letter u but she gets the spelling right for e words (just an example). I found out she is really good with subtraction but her addition isn't as high (this is a true example).\n\nThe difficulty. the games adjust to your child's learning capabilities. Tangled started out identifying letters and has progressed to how to spell words. The learning path indicates how close your child is to an increase in difficulty as well. I have witnessed the games change depending on how my daughter answers it. She is a very smart kid so it's great to see her learning new things and being challenged. Note: the games concepts are fairly simple I have my daughter guide me through her games and she really understands why she is doing something, what the objective it (like in the Brave game), and understand the questions being asked (Pixar pals is a challenge for navigating to collect the keys but the mini games are fun and she really grasps the concepts).\n\nvariety. This has so much to offer. It has the appeal of a video game but it is educational. While my kids love my tablet and smartphone, this is so much better. It drains the battery far less, and you don't have to worry about them messing up your settings! My kids will sit and play the same game on their leappads longer than my devices where the play something for a little bit here and there. Plus they are catered for special age groups.\n\nThe battery. The rechargeable battery is must! The worst thing about the leappad 1 is having to swap out the batteries. Its very unsafe my 2 year old is constantly popping off the back with his stylus but the leappad 2 is updated and really difficult to pop off (plus there's no need!). It does take a long time to fully charge and if it is being played, the charging only seems to keep the system on and doesn't really charge.\n\nCons: the learning path/ leapfrog connect. While I adore the learning path the whole leapfrog connect site is a super pain! It runs extremely slow. I had bought 5 apps and a video for my kids and it took nearly 3 hours to download to the system then link the to the leappads. It has a tendency to freeze and force shutdown while trying to navigate. I will select a device and it will show the wrong ones. At least the new leappad ultra has the wifi to avoid this feature.\n\nthe buttons. the location of the buttons are rather odd. The volume buttons are big and prominent but I feel like my 2 year old turns it up full volume just because the buttons are noticeable (and the leappad is very loud on full volume!) the microphone is off to the side which is a little strange. The my kids turn the leappads to be able to use it (for instance to dry the pet after baths you blow into the microphone) so they can't see the screen.\n\nPrice, the game cartridges vary depending on where you purchase them. My kids have the tendency to take them out often and they have started to get grubby. (We also have to blow into the leappads if they haven't been played recently and there's no game in them). But the games are always 25 to download, which really adds up! The games tend to be very short, Tangled is about an hr to 2 hrs to play through. And the downloaded games are short about the same time for games like splurgle (my kids love this app!). At least they love to replay the games. It really adds up to buy the apps. The apps are nice because the kids have things to choose from on the leappads without having a cartridge to lose. They offer good deals and if you can find the download cards on sale and buy the apps on sale to save money.\n\nThis has been a huge success and I think the Leappad 2 beats out the Leappad 1, it's worth it for the two cameras, the extra storage space, and definitely the battery system. My kids were 1 1/2 and 3 1/2 when they first played and they did well and a year later it still is a top toy around the home!"}

They do run sales so be sure to look for those.\n\nAs far as durability the case gets scratched fairly easily but the sceeen doesn't.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "LeapFrog is a company that most parents trust and with good reason. Their products are marketed as educational, which they are. Mostly, they are the 'learning' versions of the habits and skills we want in our children without the guilt associated with handing them a myriad of electronics meant for adults.\n\nLeapPad is no different. Larger than an iPhone but smaller than most tablets, its chunky feel is great for small hands. It doesn't feel slippery or fragile. With the choice of Monsters Inc cases, the added protection gets a fun makeover. I enjoy the functionality of this product, with the easy open battery cover and the attached stylus/ pen.\n\nThis LeapPad come preloaded with a handful of fun apps, with more available for purchase (with your $20 gift card) at the LeapFrog store. More pricy than iPhone/ Andriod apps, this is the big downside.\n\nThe other negative is the batteries, which you will need 4 AA. I suggest you buy an industrial size Costco box and keep them handy. There is the option to purchase rechargeable batter pack, which would make a world of difference for me and most parents I know.\n\nThere are fun little things like the camera, the way to personalize your child's LeapPad with a photo of him/her. It is super fun for a 4 year old to have ownership of a device, with the added benefit of having Mom and Dad's iPhone safely in their pocket."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "The LeapFrog LeapPad2 Disney/Pixar Monsters University Varsity Edition is a fantastic alternative to your iPad. The bundle comes with the unit, 8 preinstalled apps (that I can tell), a Gel Skin Monsters U. cover, 2 Sticker Sheets, a cleaning cloth thingie, a nifty $20 Digital Download Gift card thing and a USB Cable.\nThe LeapPad2 sports some nice, educational apps for kids but the $20 download gift card didn't go very far since most apps run in the $15-$20 range for the decent ones. You can also pick up some cartridge apps here on Amazon or at Target for the same price range but they are a physical cartridge you plug into the unit.\nThe screen is nice, at 5 inches, the resolution isn't too bad.  The touch response is also pretty good - your child can use their hands or the included stylus (which is attached by a sturdy string)to interact with the LeapPad2.\nWith the gel skin cover, the LeapPad2 is easy to grip and hold and will provide hours of fun for your child - that is, if the battery holds. The unit is powered by 4 AA batteries that never seem to last very long.  My son does like to leave the unit on, so we were going through batteries like crazy.&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/LeapFrog-LeapPad2-Power-Kids-Learning-Tablet-Green-includes-rechargeable-battery-40-value/dp/B00CP4J7OY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">LeapFrog LeapPad2 Power Kids' Learning Tablet, Green (includes rechargeable battery - $40 value)</a>Will fix that problem though.

Out of the box the setup is easy, just put in some batteries sync with the online account and you are off and playing.

My son is an autistic child, and after receiving the LeapPad2 and using the social/emotional games, the PetPad, the writing games, and all the other games he received and has since received for the device, I've got to say this product was a GODSEND for us. Where he could not identify any emotions at all before, after months of using this product, he can now identify simple emotions like happy and sad 3/4 of the time. His tremor when he attempts to use his fine motor skills has improved-thanks to the stylus he uses for many of the games. In fits of rage, he's thrown it down stairs, across rooms, etc., and yet it still works just as well now as the day he got it. iPads, Nabi's, etc. are all recommended for children with ASD; I recommend the LeapPad 2 for small children with autism, as it is geared towards their age group and is much, much more durable, and is less expensive.

Although sharing isn't really an issue right now, I think it will be as they get older.\n\nThis bundle comes with a Mike silicone skin which goes on easily, but I'm not sure how much protection it offers in the way of drops. I think it will be adequate, because common sense says that a tablet made for kids will be more durable/shock resistant than one made for \"adults.\"  There is also a gift card included to use in the LeapPad \"app\" store.  Just keep in mind as you shop, that the \"apps\" are much more expensive, instead of the $1-$3 apps on most sites, some of these run $15 or more.  I really wish that LeapPad would offer more inexpensive apps, and that may be something that they do in the future.\n\nOne \"add on\" purchase I really recommend is they rechargable battery pack (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/LeapFrog-LeapPad2-Recharger-Pack-Works-only-with-LeapPad2/dp/B007U7M0WM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">LeapFrog LeapPad2 Recharger Pack (Works only with LeapPad2)</a>) There is no way to comprehend the sheer number of batteries that this thing goes through.  It is crazy.  I didn't order one at first because I didn't think the twins would use too many batteries, but I was WRONG!  The recharger pack also stays charged longer than typical rechargeable batteries.\n\nIn short, I highly recommend this toy.  It has stood up well to two 2 1/2 year olds, and I anticipate them using this for many years.  There is a large number of games available at varying levels, so this toy can be used for some time, from toddler-hood to elementary school age.

But if you have kids like mine your tablet may have been... dropped down the stairs and now has a sizeable dent and a couple cracks on the side, for example. (See my Nook for examples, unfortunately.) So I'm reticent to allow the kids to play with the more expensive tablets and Smartphones because they are one drop away from ruining a $500 device. But this device I can give them with no worries! And they love it almost as much.\n\nWhat you get in the package is a LeapPad 2 with a relaly nice gel cover in the shape of Mike's head, a gift card to use at LeapFrog's website to buy a couple games, and a very small sheet of stickers. The product is well designed and works well. The touch screen is responsive and the games are educational and fun. While the gel cover is no Otterbox it is definitely enough for this device as the device is thick and solidly made and the screen is not a full glass front like on a normal tablet.\n\nEarlier I said the kids love it ALMOST as much as a tablet. That's the truth. If your kids are used to playing games like Angry Birds, Temple Run, or Ski Patrol (and the like) then they will get bored with this after a bit. The games here are learning games and creative games, which are cool, but are not fast paced or as much fun as the games available on iOS and Android. I'm sure they will live without our Smartphones!\n\nOne reason why you and I (as parents) will like it ALMOST as much as we like our tablets is that these games and apps are WAY more expensive than similar apps on Android or iOS. In fact, most of my favorite educational apps on Android are $1-3 (or free on Amazon's store as the app of the day.) But on LeapFrog's closed ecosystem you'll get games that are routinely $10-15! They are easy to program, run on almost no memory, and have no business being that expensive. I'm guessing the gift card for credit is included to help us parents overcome our initial shock at finding that more games cost a ton of money.\n\nEven with the high cost of additional content and the lack of strictly fun, big name games, this product is great for preschool and K kids. My boys love it. And I'm much happier giving them this to play with than my Smartphone or Tablets. I do recommend it - just be aware of what you're buying."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "I had been looking at the LeapPad2 as a present for my son's 4th birthday when I saw this Monsters University package available.  When it arrived the first thing I noticed was the great color scheme.  The blue frame with the Monsters Inc./University characters on it looks really nice.  The user setup was quite easy, taking you step-by-step, and I had no problems.  My son enjoys that his picture is attached to his profile.  I was already familiar with the LeapPad2's standard software package but this one came with a few extras.  There is a calendar, calculator, and notepad.  Right now my son doesn't care about them, but it doesn't really hurt to have them and maybe older kids would get some use out of them, especially the calculator.  My son has been using his LeapPad for a few weeks now and we've had no problems with it.  It is simple enough that he can operate it himself after I gave him a brief demonstration of the front- and rear-facing cameras, the tilt-sensitive control, and the microphone.  The rubberized monster cover is great.  My 1-yr-old laughs when he sees it with its ONE EYE!  The small horns are fun too.  The stickers were a big hit with the kids as well.  My 1-yr-old enjoys just using the stylus or his fingers to draw or paint pictures in the art studio app which has a good variety of options for pencil or brush, colors, and stamps and it also makes pencil or paint brush sounds while you work on your art.  It also came installed with the standard pet game which allows you to take care of your pet.  This includes activities such as tickling, feeding, and bathing them.  For instance, when bathing you select the steps to wash your customized pet.  When it is time to dry you blow into the microphone, it makes a blow dryer noise and your pet gets dry.  Both my sons find this great fun.  This pet game also allows your child a chance to practice writing their letters and my 4-yr-old uses this quite a bit.  The package comes with a $20 gift card to redeem with LeapFrog online which I did with no trouble.  I haven't spent it yet but it's nice that you can apply the balance to your account and don't have to spend it immediately.  That way I don't have to keep track of the gift card until I decide on a purchase.  The software setup on my computer was no problem.  I just plugged in the LeapPad and it prompts you to through the installation or starts the application if it's already installed.  The app itself is easy to navigate and keeps track of each LeapFrog device and profile you have.  I can monitor my son's progress in different areas such as shape recognition, math, reading, writing, science, et cetera.  This is a really nice feature.  I was easily able to download and install the freebie app from a small selection of their free giveaways.  So far we've purchased the Jake and the Neverland pirates games which my son loves.  He pops in the cartridge and away he goes.  The other titles we've downloaded and installed including an e-book which can read it to you or let you read it yourself and a spaceship game.\n\nWe recently went on vacation and this was the perfect distraction on the airplane.  Overall I'm really pleased with this device.  There's no wifi connectivity so I don't have to worry about my kids being exposed to anything I didn't put on there myself.  The awesome monster cover looks and feels great so my son doesn't want to take it off like he might be tempted to do otherwise and it protects all the edges in case of a drop.  The screen is bright and clear and the volume goes all the way up and down with many comfortable settings between and there's also a headphone jack. The apps are very helpful to children.  Most verbally guide your child through the skills needed to play the game, offering help when the child seems to be stuck and sometimes indicating with arrows where a particular control is on the device.  The games are educational, building math, reading, and writing skills, and not overly expensive.  The front and rear cameras are decent quality and fun to use to incorporate picture and movies into apps like the cartoon movie creator.  Any pictures, video, or projects your child creates on the LeapPad are easily synced to the computer when you plug in the USB.  It'll ask you if you want to copy or transfer the content off.  I believe that mp3s can now be sent and played on this LeapPad2 which they couldn't do before, but I'm pretty sure recent software updates have enabled this which is nice.  I haven't tried it yet though.  I do wish they would package it with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/LeapFrog-LeapPad2-Recharger-Pack-Works-only-with-LeapPad2/dp/B007U7M0WM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">LeapFrog LeapPad2 Recharger Pack (Works only with LeapPad2)</a>&nbsp;since we do go through batteries.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "My granddaughter loves this thing. She and her sister fight over using it, so I had to buy a 2nd one. It's durable and fun for them. The downside is that it takes 4 AA batteries and isn't rechargable, so they go through the batteries. It would have been nice if the unit came with more kid-appropriate apps, as the gift card included doesn't go far. Overall it's great if you don't have an iPad for the kids to use."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "This particular Leap Pad does not come with the rechargeable battery pack.  You will want to order that quickly, so you don't go through an inconceivable amount of batteries. We already had one Leap Pad so we just pulled the rechargeable battery from it for awhile, since everyone wanted to play on this one instead.\n\nThis Monsters University Leap Pad has the standard games that each one starts with, as well as a Cartoon Creator game my kids have loved, and the option to choose one of 4 free games online.  You will need to use the included USB cord to download the games to your computer, as it does not have wi-fi capabilities (a plus, in my book).\n\nThe Monsters University Leap Pad also came with a $20 gift card for downloading apps, which enabled us to get an additional 3 games (it was a sale). That's a nice bonus, but I'd have preferred having the battery pack.  What it basically means is that the higher price of the Monsters University Leap Pad is primarily going toward the Disney brand/design.\n\nSpeaking of the Monsters University Theme, the Monsters University skin is primarily for style.  It's a thin rubber skin, and doesn't seem like it would provide any protection if the Leap Pad were dropped.  It just dresses up the Leap Pad a little. Thankfully, it goes on easily, and comes off easily.  This is important if you're using AA batteries that need to be changed frequently.\n\nBecause our computer has Windows XP we had to do an online search for \"Leap Pad Windows XP\" to find the right software for downloading games to our Leap Pad. But it was easy to use after that. Be prepared to add apps and games, which range from $10 - $25 each, as the kids may grow tired of the familiar games after awhile.\n\nMy kids (age 3 through 12) all love the Leap Pad and we have had more than our share of discussions about whose turn it is.  It's a fun, compact educational toy that can be enjoyed at home, or on the road.  I especially like that earbuds or headphones can be added so that it can be used quietly.\n\nIf your kids just love Monsters University and you're willing to pay a little more for the MU design, you'll be rewarded with the $20 app gift card.  If you're just looking for a Leap Pad for your family to start out with, you'd probably do better buying a plain one that includes the rechargeable battery pack."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "If you are looking for the basic LeapPad 2 for your child, this one is great!  It comes with the Mike silicone skin, stickers, a $20 LeapFrog App card, a screen wipe, and a blue LeapPad 2 with Sulley and Mike on the front.  If you are in the market for a LeapPad and trying to decide between this and the LeapPad Ultra, definitely go with the Ultra.  The Ultra has the plug in charger, bigger screen, and wifi capabilities.  However, if you are just looking for a LeapPad 2, this one was great!  My preschooler was so excited by Mike and Sulley, he can't get enough!  One bummer was that within 3 minutes of him using it, the stylus scratched the screen.  I guess it was just at the perfect angle, but it was disappointing to have it scratch so easily and quickly."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "Please note:  This version does not come with a charger - so you have to use batteries with it, buy a charger, or find one that works from your existing electronics.\n\nThe Monsters University version of the LeapPad2 was a blast to unwrap and play with for the kids.  I will admit that my only mistake was not grabbing the stickers immediately and creating a fun craft for them to do - by the time I saw that they had been picked up, it was time to try to remove the 3 stickers from the tablet.  Otherwise, setup was fast and easy.\n\nOut of the box, you receive: The Monsters University Themed blue LeapPad2, the Green Mike Gel Cover, two sheets of stickers, a small Monsters University Cleaning Cloth (one of those micro-fiber cloths that are great at removing fingerprints and dust), 7 paper wallpaper pictures (I think you can use them to take pictures to use on the learning system - ours just got played with and added to art projects), and a $20 card for downloads.  It also comes with a USB cable that can be used to connect the LeapPad2 to the computer so you can sync it with your Leap account and add/remove apps, books, etc.\n\nThe LeapPad2 comes with a few preloaded apps, but the only ones the kids ever use are the Pet Pad, where they get to create their own pet, feed it, play with it, etc. and the photo app - the kids love this one.  They can take pictures and embellish them, or they can create their own pictures via drawing.  This one is a HUGE favorite in our house.  The drawing program includes the ability to stamp with fun shapes, so the kids always get creative and layer them.\n\nYou can get creative and search for free Leap App codes online and add the freebies to the LeapPad quickly to get an idea of what you like and don't like.\n\nWe have some of the LeapPad Explorer games, so I very rarely look at the apps - we just use it for the learning games, which we love.  Some favorites are the Phineas and Ferb game, Pixar Pals, Scooby Doo, and Jake and the Neverland Pirate.\n\nI love that I can encourage the boys to \"Play\" and Learn with the LeapPad2 - they think they are playing games, but they are also learning at the same time.  Instead of being a waste of time and brain cells, this is helpful.\n\nOne other note - it is worth looking up the videos of the Explorer games you can buy for this as you can see what your child will be doing and can gauge if it will be a good fit."}

They sent me a brand new one.\nThey are definitely one of my favorite companies. They stand behind their products and care about their customers.\n9 months later and my 4yo still loves this game system and it truly assists him with his pencil grip and learning how to write letters etc. I cannot say enough good things about the LeapPad 2"}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "My three-year-old absolutely loves His Monsters University LeapPad2. Because the protective skin for the LeapPad bears the eye of Monsters Inc character Mike, he likes to call it his \"Eye iPad,\" and he loves that he's got something of his own, in just his size, that allows him to play electronic learning games like older kids do. If he had to rate this device, he'd probably give it 10 stars. As the person who is responsible for purchasing apps and monitoring his game play, I've got a few more considerations to take in mind and can give this a very solid 4-stars. I'd give it a 4.5 if I could.\n\nThe LeapPad2 bundle comes with $20 in credit good at the LeapFrog site. Some apps tend to be quite expensive. Many of the more popular character-based games and apps run around $25 each. Simpler games that use the LeapFrog characters, Violet and Scout, can be had in the $5-$15 range. Finding apps for a 3-year-old can be a bit challenging. My son would be happy to play the same game over and over and over again. And while I recognize that repetition is an important component of learning, I'd like for him to have more choices about games. But the majority of apps available for the three year-old set are videos. I'm sure this would be just fine for some, but as we limit both his TV and electronic device time, I don't want to have them just become one big babysitter. The great thing is you're not limited to apps with the LeapPad Ultra; you can also purchase game cartridges (though I'd get these directly from Amazon or a brick-and-mortar store before getting them directly from LeapFrog). My son's current favorite is&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/LeapFrog-Disney-Doc-McStuffins-Learning-Game-works-with-LeapPad-Tablets-and-Leapster-GS/dp/B00D38UBJ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">LeapFrog Disney Doc McStuffins Learning Game (works with LeapPad Tablets and Leapster GS)</a>, which is a great game for three year olds because it centers around something they all love--toys!\n\nMost of the LeapPad games require players to listen to verbal commands, so I don't recommend this for kids younger than three. We got this bundle when my son was a few months shy of three, and it's remarkable the difference between the directions he was able to follow then versus now. In addition to verbal commands, users need (and will develop) good hand-eye-coordination. This particular screen is just a touch less sensitive than it should be. Whether using the stylus or his finger, my son sometimes has difficulty getting the LeapPad to recognize his touch. I thought it might just be him, but even when I hold his finger down on whichever object he's trying to touch, the sensitivity isn't where it needs to be. But I suppose this is also a lesson in perseverance because, although there are moments when he just furiously bangs on the screen to try to get it to register, he's eventually able to get it to work or he switches games to something that will pick up his touch better (which, I suppose, may be a stronger indicator of a game issue than a device issue).\n\nWhile I ordered this device primarily for my son, my 7-year-old daughter enjoys it just as much. She has her own iPad, but where my son has difficulty with apps, I think the educational nature of the LeapPad games has a much stronger appeal to her. Many of the games are story-based and she enjoys the game play and \"teaching\" her brother how to use his device. She's even taken to looking for LeapPad apps at the toystore so that she can \"help\" us find apps that will appeal to and teach her brother (and her).\n\nAs far as the accessories that come with this bundle, the skin is pretty awesome, and the cleaning cloth is be cool (but the kids aren't exactly using it to keep the screen clean). The wallpapers are digital, so they're neat, but you can only use one at a time, and they don't matter once you've got an app running. The stickers are cute, but I couldn't let my kids near them and the Leappad at the same time (the screen would be covered!). But one thing that my kids LOVE was being able to take their own pictures and set up their own accounts. They are very aware of who is signed in at any particular time.\n\nLike any new electronic gadget that you may not be familiar with, there's a definite learning curve to the LeapPad2, particularly in terms of figuring out which apps to purchase. But in the long run, we are very happy with this product, and game time is a reward that my kids are willing to work for."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "My daughter has a Leap Pad 1 and has enjoyed it for the past two years.  We have a variety of apps; her favorite is the Jake and the Neverland Pirates app and the drawing app (included with Leap Pad).  She also enjoys watching Dora videos.\n\nThe LeapPad 2 adds some great new features.  The Monsters Univ. bundle has an adorable design and comes with a protective silicone skin, which is really cute.  Setup is relatively simple using LeapFrog Connect software.\n\nThe features that the LeapPad 2 adds above the original Leappad is a front-facing camera, more memory (4 GB vs 2 GB) and better battery life.  Perhaps our favorite thing is the improved battery case.  The original leappad required you use the stylus or a coin to \"pry\" open the battery cover.  It was a total pain and broke a stylus one time.  This one has a hinge and is so much easier, which is good, because you do replace the batteries quite a bit.  You can get a power adapter (instead of using batteries).  If you use AA batteries I definitely recommend rechargeable batteries and this burns through them pretty quickly.\n\nOverall the LeapPad is a great product for kids age 3-9.  Some of the apps are a little challenging for my 4 year old, but she will grow into the device with time.  I don't have to worry about durability or her breaking it.  It's nice and solid, her LeapPad (original) is still going strong.  Another great educational product from LeapFrog."}

He is crazy about Monsters Inc and the University, so he is very happy with all of the Disney aspects of it.  The great things are that he can personalize it and it comes with a card where he can download some games.  Now, his Mom did mention she wished the eBooks were not so expensive as the hardback book, and with children's books especially you can see her point, but that was her only beef.  That is a whole other story as many publishers are learning hopefully that is not the way to go. The cost of the books was the only reason this did not get a five star in that area too.  This is very educational and for once Mom does feel like he is  at least learning something when he uses it.  And anytime you can sneak learning in on kids the fun way, everybody wins.  The cover makes it very durable and not vulnerable to breakage which, lets face it comes part and partial to nine year old boys.  I would highly recommend this Leapad2 to any parent.

Several months ago, the screen cracked.  I wrote to the company and they replaced it for free.  Wonderful.  It was a hassle to transfer all of his learning apps, games, etc. to the new device and none of his progress had been saved.  I figured it was worth it because certainly nothing would happen to this new LeapPad2.  However, the exact same thing happened again a few months after we received the replacement device.  My son was not using the device incorrectly or harshly.  I wrote to the company again and explained the situation.  They offered me 15% off my purchase of a new device and that's it.  I am disgusted with the company for not offering anything better than 15% off the purchase of a new one.  Obviously something is wrong when the screens continue to crack after several months of normal use.  I don't recommend this device at all because it's not worth the investment or time you'll spend having to wait for replacements and to re-install all of your child's games and apps onto a new one when the screen cracks every few months."}

Sometimes they share by one kid taking the blue leap pad with the monster pictures and another kid will put the green monster-faced soft cover over another leap pad.

The school year is off to a great start now that I have this fantastic device. It is used as a \"free time\" activity that has my students rushing to finish their school work quickly so they can be the first to use it. We also have an iPad in the class, but since this is the 'newest\" and most colorful game we have all the kids want to play it. Now, you must remember that I am talking high school aged students with disabilities here. It is an excellent educational tool that teaches and reinforces basic skills. The apps are a little on the spendy side, but I am always willing to spring for activities that help my kids.\n\nThe only downfall is that it doesn't have a rechargable internal battery. It requires 4 AA batteries, but they do seem to last quite a while, I haven't had to replace them yet, after 2 weeks of almost non-stop play time throughout the day. The students also love the camera capability. They have enjoyed taking \"selfies\" and also photographing their classmates. The picture quality isn't very good, but it is good enough for the kids..they seem to love it. Overall, this is a a great product for a great price.

Here's how they stack up.\n\nMemory: The LeapPad2 has a 4GB memory while the Innotab3 has a 2GB memory and can accept a microSD card up to 32GB\n\nButtons: Both tablets have the same buttons but the Innotab3 has a couple of extras viz a brightness control button, a help button and a lock button at the back for the battery compartment\n\nCamera and picture quality: The LeapPAD2 comes with 2 cameras, one in front and one in the rear. The picture quality is decent, it does a good job of adapting to the lighting and it has video recording capabilities. The Innotab3 comes with a single camera that can swivel 180 degrees from front to back. The picture quality is very poor. I was extremely underwhelmed\n\nInitial parental setup: Both tablets took a while (1 hour approximately) to setup the first time but the LeapPAD2 setup was easier and faster. The Innotab3 software hung-up on my computer a few times before I finally got it to install\n\nApps: Both systems offer a variety of movie, music and game apps. VTech's (for Innotab3) offered more apps, had a wider variety of characters (Hello Kitty was one that Leapfrog did not have) and the price of the apps ranged from $2.50-30 with the majority being around $5. Leapfrogs appcenter (for the LeapPad2) had fewer apps and they cost more. The cost of the apps needs to be considered before you get too excited about the $20 digital download card that comes with this particular version of the LaepPad2. I was offered a 30% discount on the apps for my first purchase and managed to buy 3 cheap apps.\n\nConclusion: The cost of the apps is a major negative for me. Right now my kids are too young to demand for apps but as they grow older, I don't think I will be inclined to fork out $20 per app."}

It's educational, teaches them how to interact with computers/smart phone type devices and I am glad I got them.  I was afraid that we were spoiling them getting our kids basically a game system, but the programs are educational and my daughter shows ME how to use it.  I'm surprised at what she's learned.

This is educational and entertaining."}

BUT if you have any issues with the unit at all the Customer Support from LeapFrog makes this a negative star review!\n\nI have two of these (for my four year old twins).  I ordered this one from Amazon because the store was out of the green.  He played with it for a bit and we noticed it would require charging WAY before my daughters.  I changed the batteries, bought the charger packs, switched the packs, charged it EVERY night, etc etc.  Finally emailed support 20 days after receiving it, by this time it would just quit and wouldn't turn on at times even.\n\nSo I started the send them an email, wait two days for response, do the same things we did to 'trouble shoot it' even though I told them I had done it all game.  Finally got 'new' batteries in the mail to test it again and thankfully also a label to send it back.  Sent it back 32 days after getting the unit and waited, and waited.  42 days later I emailed them for an 'update'.  That same night I got the unit back in the mail, no note, no reason, no USB cord I mailed them, nothing.\n\nIt did turn on so I put it on the charger overnight, praying it was fixed.  This morning I bought $45 in new apps and was able to download them all to the game.  Unplugged it from the computer, got the twins in the car to head out for the day ... and it wouldn't turn on again!!!\n\nLong story coming to a close, I just spent 30 minutes arguing with them on the phone, they want me to send it back for testing again!!!  I am awaiting for a supervisor call back as I vent ..... grrrrr.  I'm thinking I should have just tried to go through Amazon when it first broke instead of LeapFrog ... Amazon has 110% Customer Service in my book and I'm kicking myself right now as I'm listening to my twins argue over the one working one, since they both want to play with the new apps :("}

If you're going to get your kid any sort of tablet like device, this is the most appropriate choice.  Within this kit, you get: an adorable tear-resistant gel skin, 2 scary-silly sticker sheets, a cleaning cloth, and a $20 Digital Download card.  It is also loaded with special Monsters University wallpapers.  For charging, you get a USB cord.\n\nAs far as durability, this is something that I wouldn't be worried giving to a young kid.  The skin adds even more durability and allows for a nice, easy grip.  The screen is solid and should take plenty of play before it starts to wear.  While young kids (the two year old set) might have trouble holding this, my 5 and 6 year old kid testers had no trouble holding it and using the stylus.\n\nThe choice of games available for this system is vast and diverse.  While we found the games to be the most fun, you can also download learning videos and music.  This unit has a camera that shoots both front and back, so there are also a number of apps that deal with creative photography. Apps are (for the most part) appropriately priced.  With the giftcard you receive with this package, we were able to purchase 3 apps to attach to this unit, which is pretty good for the amount on the card!\n\nMy kid testers picked this up straight away when they noticed it.  And you know what?  They really enjoyed it.  Now that we have more apps on it, I look forward to seeing what they think!  This is the perfect tablet device for them at the moment!"}

I feel like we should own stock in Duracell, we have gone through so many batteries. We tried purchasing an electric cord to use instead constantly replacing batteries, but the cord fit poorly and constantly disconnected, also did not allow for any range of motion which a child requires. Also all the apps in the store are very pricey. The downloadable games and apps are pricey as well and they don't tell you that although there are hundreds of titles blah blah blah, but they can' t be downloaded unless you make space by uninstalling the old apps. Where do the pricey old apps go when you uninstall them? Who knows, they are in Leap Pad oblivion! All in all very disappointed with this product, do yourself a favor and buy your child a DS (Rechargeable!) or a tablet."}

The camera/video camera is a particular favorite and I like how most of the games are \"learning\" games just right for her kindergarten level. A word of warning: this thing eats up the batteries (AAs) so get yourself to Costco and buy the large pack. In my experience, though, it's a small price to pay. Our house doesn't do the video game thing and our kids don't have Wii's or things like that. For now, the LeapPad is a decent compromise. For kids older than 5 or so, though, it probably wouldn't fly. My 7 year old, for example, will fiddle around with it on long car rides, but wouldn't be caught dead p,along it in front of friends, haha."}

They both really enjoy watching videos on them, and my 5 year old likes the books and games.  My 2 year old is more in to the videos, drawing and taking pictures on his.  I originally bought these for travel, but we use them quite a bit around the house as well.  I think it's a great introduction to the type of technology that my children will grow up with, but I have been most impressed with the durability.  I'm not sure if my results are typical or not; but like I mentioned before, my 2 year old has one which comes along with about every mess you can think of.  He has literally peed on the screen (ugh...BOYS!), gotten popsicle juice all over it and even chucked it across the room, and it still works perfectly fine.  The main reason for it only getting 4 stars is that you have to have quite a bit of patience when connecting the device to a computer.  The whole process of downloading games and syncing them seems to take forever (and it's not a slow internet connection causing the problem).  I do like that I can buy one game and use it on both devices, though.  Overall, it's a really good product."}

So far we haven't purchased any apps for it because the apps that come with it seem to be enough entertainment for him for now. However it doesn't come with videos or e-books those are extra ( They range from $5.00-$25.00 per app at Leapfrog.com). The Pet Pad is his favorite app. There he can practice handwriting, spelling, and bathe his pet.  You can create your own breed of animals.(example: a purple dragon with a pig's ears, a cat's mouth that barks like a dog) Play with your pet by popping balloons. Feed your pet. ( I enjoy this game alot when he goes to bed). He can draw pictures, The Photo Art is neat, cause he can take pictures of himself to draw on. The LeapPad 2 has a camera, and video recorder built in so they can make their on home movies. You can adjust your children's learning levels from pre-k to 6th grade. They're 3 individual profiles plus 1 guest profile. Example if you have 3 kids; you will have a profile for each kid & a profile for a \"guest\" child so you'd only need 1 Leapfrog2 pad. Each profile you can custom to that child except guest their progress isn't recorded or saved. It is worth the money. It can take a beating! I like the fact the LeapPad2 doesn't have wi-fi. There's no way he can get on the internet and no one can hack his toy. It also has a music app with 5 songs that are educational like ABC song, The Vowel song, ect."}

There is no reason for LeapFrog to require this, as it is not making changes to your PC, but to the LeapPad.  In addition, it will not run the software, if there are any updates available.  You are required to run the update.  So you are putting your computer at risk of the LeapFrog software makers, who can change the software whenever, and you can't keep running the old one.  For this reason, I would recommend you not buy this, unless you have a spare PC with which to do the downloads of apps, or unless you are willing to just run the included apps, which are quite good by themselves."}

My 5 year old turned it on today (Wednesday) and said that it kept signing her in as a guest.  It's as though the screen is not aligned properly.  Anytime I attempt to tap on something at the top of the screen, something on the bottom of the screen pops up.  So, even though I tapped their names (which were first and second on the screen), it responded as though I tapped the 4th item on the screen.  When the icons popped up on the next screen, I again attempted to tap the icon at the top and it responded by opening an icon 3 rows down.  I thought perhaps it might have been a battery issue (sometimes things start to respond oddly when the batteries are low) but no such luck.  This is maybe the 3rd time this unit has been turned on.  I'm quite surprised because people have frequently mentioned how much they love their LeapFrog products.  I'm going to return it to the store and hope I just got a dud, but after reading the reviews, I wish I would have done more research on this before we bought it.  We've already invested $135 for the unit, 1 game and the gel skin.

I guess had this been 1990 I would have been thrilled with the leap pad device, but given the experiences with other newer devices everything about this device has been a slight let down.\n\n1.)  It does not come with a recharging battery system.  You have to purchase your own batteries or the leapfrog rechargeable battery kit.  Suddenly the device isn't as inexpensive as it first appears.\n\n2.)  It comes with a few apps which are educational and cute in a way, but they pale in comparison to even some of the free apps available on any apple, android, or kindle device.  They appear to be 1990 apps that are slightly upgraded for a newer device.  It is not that they're bad but why hold your kid back with an inferior device.  The old version of the Kindle Fire is vastly superior in every way to this device as an educational tool for young children and is just as inexpensive if you consider all the extras this one requires to be as functional.\n\n3.)

The whole set up makes the device seem like a scam.... bait you with a cheaper device and then they get you later with added expenses\n\n4.)  Many of the games come on small cartridges.  What is this the 80s?  We've already lost half the library of games my mother bought us.  That could never happen on a kindle fire where you can can just redownload anything you purchased.\n\nIn summary this is an age appropriate educational device that is a generation behind the competition.  If you want your kids to learn on a format that they will be familiar with in school please buy any of the many tablet devices out there and forget this one.  It is  dinosaur that should have went extinct with the previous generation of this device.  It is old technology repackaged and your kids deserve better."}

Two months later it wouldnt charge and it kept turning off. I mean you turn it on the logo appears then it will shut off. Talk to customer service i went back and forward with these people. I did the troubleshooting for the leappad 2 and got a new charger and new batteries. Nothing worked after many emails later they sent a pre paid slip so I can send it back. So I did. I sent it back then I received it pretty quickly. I was excited my son had his toy back. But when i took it out of the box I notice it was heavy they had put batteries in it. So I think aww thats nice they put batteries in it too. But when I turned it on It wasn't fix at all. It had the same issues. So all they did was put new batteries and sent it back. I was very upset at this point. I again contacted customer service. They told me that on their system it said that the toy turns on and shows the logo. And that the toy was looked at. I told them that it did turn on but turned off and I wouldn't be writing back if everything was ok. No responds back. This whole process alone was terrible. I hate LeapPad 2 Now! I refuse to buy another one. I rather save up and buy my kid a ipad mini. So now I have two broken Leappad 2, rechargeable batteries, silcone case and a bunch of apps that I could no longer use. That's alot of money down the drain."}

The screen is cracked and I called Leap Frog to locate somewhere where the screen could be fixed.  There are no way to replace screens on these expensive toys.  They expected me to buy a new one without any guarantee that in the future the same would not happen. I am very disappointed with the fact of the amount of money put into this system between the unit itself and the add on's that there is no way to fix it if broken.  This was a total waste of money!  Money spent that is now in the toilet!  :("}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "If you are buying for a small child who needs a durable device this is good. However beware of the added expense for apps. Apps range in price from $7 to $25, and the better apps cost the most. If you were to actually load all of the apps displayed on the screen's packaging sticker you will easily spend an additional $150. If you are shopping for an older child who will take care of their toys go ahead and splurge on an ipad or Android. It will save you money  in the long run, give you a much better app selection, and is more user friendly for you and your child."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "I've been thoroughly impressed with our Leappad 2. My son had no trouble at all learning to use the tablet even a couple of months after his 3rd birthday, although most of the games are designed for children 4 and up. I thought he might not like a tablet for kids, since he's been allowed to borrow Kindles and iPads, but it's proved to be very entertaining. The games and ebooks we've tried are fun but with a pretty strong educational component. I'm a huge advocate of limiting \"screen time\" for kids, but the learning and interactive aspects of the games make me feel good about letting him use these games in appropriate doses. Although he's a pretty careful guy, he is three and so far the Leappad has withstood the normal wear and tear with flying colors.\n\nThe only drawback I see is the price of additional games, but they do seem to be pretty high quality, with enough content to be interesting for quite awhile.\n\nI did receive our Leappad 2 free as a part of the Vine program in order to review a specific game. However, I did not have to write this review of the Leappad itself, and the opinions are all mine."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "Santa brought two of these this year for my sons, ages 2 1/2 and 5, and I can finally have my phone back.  The kids love taking pictures and videos of themselves, and they get so excited every time they master a skill or a level in a game.  I like being able to track their progress, download all of their photos, and the fact that if I purchase a game on the app website, I can put it on both devices.  Unfortunately, some of the games are somewhat pricey ($25 for the \"cartridges\", but some are as low as $5 or $6), but if you purchase the download card from Amazon (they'll offer a $20 card for $17, for example) and then wait for a \"buy two get one free\" deal on Leap Frog's app site, you can feel a little better about spending the money on games.  Most of what I am impressed with isn't the device at all -- Leap Frog's customer service is outstanding.  I had some initial trouble getting them set up and figuring out how to put games on them right before Christmas, and Leap Frog responded to my e-mail questions typically within 24 hours, and had solutions for my issues.  I was also impressed with Amazon's customer service.  One month after Christmas, my older son stepped on his and shattered the screen.  After spending all that money on the Leap Pad and the games to put on it, I just about had heart failure, but I contacted Amazon anyway.  Despite the fact that I had exceeded the return window (and the fact that my son broke it himself), Amazon overnighted a replacement in exchange for the broken one at no additional cost."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "We bought leappads for our 2 boys (ages 3 and 5) and months of consideration. My husband and I each have an iPad and they were being fought over constantly with our boys, so we finally caved and bought them each a leappad. We have had them for a month, and here is our thoughts thus far:\n\nPros.\n\nThe picture quality is pretty nice. I was actually surprised at how nice the picture quality was when we first bought them.\n\nThey are really child friendly. Niether of my children have any problems navigating and using them.\n\nWe have the leapster explorer, and the leappad is MUCH better.\n\nCons.\n\nAfter a month of having the leappads, and the boys playing on them for a little each day, we noticed we were changing the 4 batteries they each take every week. We decided to buy the recharger packs. The packs are $40 - $50 EACH. I am ok with paying $10 or something like that, but half the price of the friggin thing to be able to recharge it?!\n\nWe decided the buy games for the boys (each pad comes with 1 game) and the average game is $7 - $25 each. Most of the good ones are at the $25 price.\n\nAccessories are pricey. We bought the head phones, which broke within a week (DO NOT BUY THEM!!!), so that was a waster of $20 each. We found a pair at Pottery Barn Kids that have been drastically more durable. We also bought skins and carrying cases for them. Kids drop them constantly, so we wanted to protect them.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nWe figure we have spent about $300 per leappad. And keep in mind, you can just play games and take pictures with it. You are better off buying a cheap ipad/ kindle. etc, where your kid can watch videos and have wifi. I would like this product much better if they didn't nickle and dime you to death."}

He was playing with my iPod Touch and managed to rearrange the icons sufficiently so it took me 20 minutes to restore it to the way I had it. So we decided to get him the LeapPad2 for him and get him off my iPod Touch.\n\nPros\n- Seems to be sturdy. I worry about him scratching the screen but others have not complained so I hope it holds up.\n- He's not using my iPod Touch any longer\n- He can't change things, load games, or spend money in the app store.\n- The physical control buttons are appropriate and simple.\n- There is lots of audio help which is great as he can't read yet.\n- Just about everything that is for sale as an app or game is educational.\n\nCons\n- Games/apps are quite expensive compared to smart phone or tablet equivalent offerings.\n- The screen resolution isn't too great but adequate\n- Its a little slow but acceptable\n- It is heavy\n\nI'm used to getting a lot of apps for free, or paying $0.99 or $1.99 for many very good apps on the iPod Touch. The games for the LeapPad2 are in the $5 to $25 range which is quite expensive.\n\nIt occurred to me that I could buy a Nexus 7 pad for $200 and have quite a few games for another $25-50. It won't take long to equal or surpass that $250 by spending for games and apps on the LeapPad2 with the cost of games being so high. Still there is the advantage of the simplicity and security of the LeapPad2 over the flexible and unconstrained Nexus 7 running Android.\n\nSo overall the LeapPad2 is good for the kids but on the expensive side."}

The Nabi Jr., which was the same price, is for younger children, looks more like a phone/tablet with how the apps are setup, came with the gel protector, 18 free apps, 18 free games, and 18 free songs; has a 180 degree camera, has a rechargeable internal battery, and it has wifi that can only be accessed in 'Mommy Mode' with a password.  Also, the apps that you can purchase from Amazon are a lot less expensive than the LeapFrog ones, and you could even put the free versions of apps on it if you wish. I would recommend this tablet to parents over the LeapFrog LeapPad any day and I wish I would have came here to read the negative reviews before I made the purchase....thank goodness I was able to return it and buy something better.  If your child is already used to playing with your phone or tablet -- than it is highly unlikely that they will enjoy playing with this product.  One of the reason I bought this for my son was so that I could have my Android back, which he was back to playing with it 15 minutes later.\n\nI don't think that LeapFrog is a terrible company--the My Pal was my son's favorite toy as an infant, and he still plays with it occasionally.  They just need to step their game up on this tablet or they are going to lose A LOT of customers (money)."}

Also, I've found it better to download/purchase the games off the leap frog website and sync them with the leappad rather than lug around all the tiny inserts you buy. Get the case as well to be safe. My daughter dropped it and nothing happened, but I want that $98 purchase to last lol."}

The free apps won't download. We've had it for 6 months after buying it as a Christmas present. So to start with to make Connect work make sure you have flash for other browsers. When it doesn't turn on and requires a tune up make sure you disable all you're online security otherwise it will freeze and take hours to tune-up, if you must buy one, buy the cartridges as using the app centre can be a nightmare. You may be one of those lucky people who write these 5 star reviews which frankly I think must be paid for by the company because had you really owned one of these you wouldn't have given it more than one star. It's great for the kids when they aren't upset because it's taking hours to fix. I hope the company doesn't comment on this and say please contact our support centre because I have countless times and they have been no help at all. When you encounter one of a million problems start with the online forums don't bother with Leapfrog's Customer Support."}

I bought the gift ahead of time from Amazon, so I was past 30 days when the problem showed up.\n\nNo problem, under warranty with Leapfrog, right? Right?\n\nYeah.  Dealing with them eventually got so incredibly miserable I gave up.  It would take about a week for them to reply to any inquiry.  Additionally, I had installed the LeapFrog LeapPad2 Recharger Pack in the LeapPad2 before the LeapPad2 went all wonky, and guess what?  The recharger pack IS NOT REMOVABLE.  I never did get LeapFrog to answer what to do about the recharger pack.  In order to get a replacement LeapPad, I was supposed to \"deface\" the defective one with a marker across the screen with a code number (RMA?) that they, guess what, forgot to include in the email instructions.\n\nYes, I really got an email with instructions that looked like, \"write this number (type in number) across the screen with a marker.\"\n\nAnd never got an answer about the batteries.\n\nAnd never got a replacement LeapPad2 either.\n\nJust based on my experience with the Customer Service, I will NEVER buy another Leap Frog item again, no matter what toy they sell.  By the time all was said and done, I should have just bought my kid an iPod Touch or iPad mini, and a durable case, and put apps on there.\n\nIMHO, Leap Frog is the biggest rip-off ever, and will never see another penny from me."}

I've e-mailed leapfrog to find out how to remove it, so it might be possible and I will update my comment when I hear back. I just think it's slimy to directly advertise to children on a toy. I have no problems saying \"no\" to my daughter, it's just matter of principle.\n\nHaving said that, we were concerned about how to limit her time on it, but that hasn't been an issue. She plays with it on longer trips in the car and every few days will ask to pull it out, but is happy to do other things as well. The battery life is OK - we've had to change the batteries 2x in the past 3 months. She's dropped it a number of times and it's still working.

I read reviews for months before I decided to purchase this for my sons 3rd birthday on May 14th and most said the LeapPad2 eat batteries, I was thinking, okay I'll have to get new batteries every week or two, I can live with that. NO! I was so wrong. My son played with it from about 5-8 that evening and maybe made it to 6:30 the next evening and the same thing happened Thursday and Friday evenings with new batteries. Needless to say, Wednesday evening I order the rechargable battery pack (which I got that Friday evening). I just could not believe how fast it ATE batteries!!!\nI initally decided to purchase the LeapPad2 to keep my sons 3 year old hands off my husbands and my's new cell phones and for our long vacation trip we are about to take (a 9 hour drive to Myrtle Beach) to keep him entertained. He has barely bothered our phones (occassionally he will pick up one if he catches it unsupervised and will snap a couple self portraits, which he now LOVES to do with his LeapPad2!) since he's got this and I think it will immensely help with the car ride in a few days.\nWith all that being said, I am very pleased with the LeapPad2. I only downloaded 3 additional apps besides the handful it came with, for one, they're expensive (I think, and which I was aware of before purchasing the Pad2) and my son is only 3, he doesn't need a bunch of apps right now. I feel he just needs to work with the few and when he's \"mastered\" those then I will change out some apps. The one \"free\" app that you get is the \"Letter Factory\", now my son already knows his ABCs, 123s, shape, colors, etc, but this app is helping him learn his letter sounds. He now walks around the house saying '\"C\" makes the sound \"ca, ca, ca\" like in \"cold\"' and he loves it! And I love that he's learning and having fun at it and doesn't realize it. All in all I would recommend this product to anyone.\nOh and one final note, I don't know if my kid is just rough still (he will purposely drop it on the floor, he's a crazy thing) or what, but it seems to be holding up just fine to his 3 year old ways, but we're only 2 weeks into ownership, so we'll see."}

At $20-$25 a pop it doesn't take long to reach the price of the ipad mini and I get get just as high quality apps that cost $25 on this device for a few bucks on the Ipad.  These guys are just trying to take advantage of parents desire to help their children learn.  On top of the incredibly high cost of the apps for the device it also tries to update every time I connect now and it keeps the computer keeps saying a USB device has failed to be recognized.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "First off, I bought this for my 3-year old, so I can't comment on other age groups.  My daughter has had her Leappad 2 (Princess) for about 2 months now and has played with it everyday.  As parents know, that is something to say when it comes to 3-year olds.  I am personally impressed as well.  Is it comparable to my Nexus 7, an iPad or an iPhone?  No.  But I didn't want her having one of those!  I wanted a durable device that is 100% focused on learning.  I honestly believe that she learns more efficiently on this device than other more adult oriented devices.  I've heard complaints about the prices of games.  I understand those gripes, but I personally don't mind paying a premium for a game that is 1) dedicated to learning and 2) adapts to their educational level (you are able to adjust the level from early pre-k to much higher learning).  Another complaint from others is battery usage.  Easy fix - get the rechargeable battery pack and that problem is solved.  If you are in a position to spend about $300, (device, battery pack and 2 gigs of apps), and can persuade your little one to take care of it as much as possible, I really believe you'll be happy with this device.  Was I in a position to drop $300? Nope, but my daughter's early education is worth it and when I see her enjoying it, it makes it worth the corners on other things I've had to cut.  My biggest complaint?  A very small one.  No way to toggle brightness?"}

Great! I purchased more of the pricey apps, plus the rechargeable battery pack, car charger, and headphones. But within another month, the screen shattered once again. This toy is supposed to be for ages three and up and should be far more durable.\n\nI wrote to Leap Frog customer service and asked to purchase another one at a discount, since I was aware of the only-one-replacement rule. After all, I have over $300 invested in this thing. They offered me a meager 15% off.\n\nI tend to agree with the other comments on here, suggesting that people buy an iPad instead of wasting their money on this. I could have purchased one for all I've put into this paperweight.\n\nFor anyone who has some skill, there is a YouTube video that shows how to replace a broken screen - of course, you first must buy a broken LeapPad2; that is, broken in some way other than the screen.\n\nI think that I am going to just sell the accessories that I have, along with the app cartridges, and start saving for an iPad."}

The case with the princesses on it is a nice touch and should be sturdy enough to survive the typical 4 year old's use and abuse."}

It is truly the only suitable \"tablet\" option for younger kids, but holy cow, it is highway robbery. I was completely mislead as to what it would cost just to USE it. It comes with 1, count it, 1 free game or app. The rest you get to buy...for a minimum of $5 each. I just went to find a book for my daughter to read on her leappad 2 in the App store. Who on this green earth of ours can afford $20, yes, I said $20 for a book for a 4 year old?! My son downloads books on his kindle for $2-$3 each. Leap Frog is making serious bank on this product. Its a very good quality item...technology is good, user-friendly and so far very reliable. One big hangup: no automatic shut off so batteries get replaced regularly.\n\nMy suggestion for a better option...wait till her 5th birthday, buy her a kindle and help her use it until she can manage it on her own. It will save me hundreds of dollars."}

The graphics are great and the whole thing is quite sturdy for drops and falls. The games are CLEARLY educations- and I like that- but they really add up in cost.  Compared to the $3 and $5 Apps on my iPhone, these range from $7-25.  Yow.  I just found two games and an album of KidzBops music that look great, and almost had a heart attack when I saw the final cost for this purchase was $45!!\n\nSo while the initial investment is low, be prepared for expense with use."}

We use to joke saying that airlines should encase their \"blackboxes\" in a Leaspter because they were so durable.  Well that impressive quality ended with the Leapster Explorer and LeapPad.\n\nSpecifically, we purchased 2 Leaspter Explorers and both broke in less than a year (no volume/sound)... LeapFrog replaced them and each of the replacements lost sound within 18 months.  We also bought 1 charger and it had to be replaced twice in 1 year by LeapFrog since it wouldn't charge.  Unacceptable at this price point.\n\nShockingly, we purchased a LeapPad and it, too, had volume/sound issues (can only hear the sound with headphones just like with Explorer).  LeapFrog replaced it and sure enough that one lost sound in a year, as well.\n\nInteresting, the original silver Leapster which is about 11 years old is still working... too bad they don't sell that one anymore.\n\nI searched the Internet and this seems to be a common problem.\n\nI warn all my new mommy friends now to not buy a LeapPad or Leapster... simply get a Mini iPad and encase it in an Otterbox for solid, reliable durability... and enjoy all the other advantages of having an iPad (email, web surfing, etc)."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "I decided to get this for my 2 year old son despite the age recommendations on the box. My 2 year old son watches his 2 older brothers play their handheld games while on extended road trips, watches Mommy use her phone to look for sights to see along the way, and watches daddy use the gps. I was letting him use my ipad to watch movies along the way, but every time we would stop the car the ipad would go tumbling. So... after doing some research, we decided to go ahead and get him the Leappad 2. Overall, he loves it He is a bit young to fully grasp what the Leappad can do however that does not stop him at all. He happily sits and taps the screen with his stylus and Oooh,s and Ahhhs when thomas the Tank engine does his thing. unfortunately he seems a bit too young for most of the game, we sit and help him, but in the car on a road trip, this is not always possible. Maybe we just got him a game that is too old for him, maybe we jumped the gun buying him this when he is only two, but this is definetly a hit, even if he doesn't get the full use out if it, and it has saved my ipad from tumbling to the floor every time i hit the brakes. As far as durability, I purchased a skin with the Leappad, and he has never used it without the skin. Having said that, the Leappad has taken quite a few falls, tumbles, gotten covered in peanut-butter, milk spilled on it, everything a 2 year old can throw at it, and it has taken it all without any complaints. There are a few minor scratches on the screen that are not even visible when the pad is turned on, but thats all. I think  the scratches are from the stylus, my son tends to use the stylus with great enthusiasm and pounds on the screen with it. As far as the educational benefits go, well that one is hard to say. I can see the educational aspects of the games, we do sit with him and do some of the games together, but we did not get this as an educational tool, we go it for long car rides, waiting in the Dr. office, etc...\n\nOverall, I definetly would recommend this to a friend, however, be warned, with a 2 year old, this will take a lot of hands-on from mommy and daddy in order for them to get full use out of it."}

He's had it for 4 months now and is very interested in the device but is already bored with the apps that go onto it. The apps range in price from 7$ to 30$ and our son becomes very bored with them quickly. I think that is ridiculous. When you update the software on the device it takes hours. To buy a short video for him to watch (Peter Rabbit) it was 7.50$ and it was a very short video. I am disappointed that a company would take advantage of children in this way. They know that parents are going to buy the apps for their children so they make them expensive because they can. That is very sad. I would suggest buying your child a Kindle Fire instead. The price is not much different, and the apps are much less expensive and more complex than this. Not to mention they are not even a fraction of the cost."}

Instead purchase the fisher price iPad or iPod cover for your product if you'd like a rugged and child-friendly product.  We have purchased over $300 in apps from LeapFrog, so I can say the following with confidence.  My main complaint is that the leapfrog library selection is weaker than the library of apps and videos available to you from the Apple iTunes store. There are actually more videos and apps related to characters like Bubble Guppies, Daniel Tiger, Umizoomi, etc on iTunes.  Furthermore, the cost of the Apple iTunes videos and apps are much cheaper than the Leapfrog selections and easier to locate.  Beyond that, one should not expect high video quality or responsiveness from this electronic.  It is mind boggling slow.  Customer service is also extremely unresponsive to issues. Within 1 hour the leapfrog 2 had crashes as well as the app center on a brand new computer.  An absolute waste of money."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "There are a lot of positives about this children's tablet, but screen durability isn't one of them.  As an educational device, this one is top notch.  I bought (3,)for my grandchildren.  My one granddaughter had hers less than a month, when the screen froze up.  As a five year old child, she kept pushing the screen and it cracked.  Explorer doesn't cover this under warranty.\n\nBUT, as it is a children's tablet, made for three to eight year olds, the screen should be more durable than that of other tablets.\n\nI Googled LeapPad2 screen issues and discovered this was a common problem, along with frozen screens, and even leakage.  I also went back and looked at Explorer's own description of what the LeapPad2 includes, no where is quality construction mentioned.  Yet, as a top children's educational toy developer Explorer should know better than to put out a tablet that won't stand up to this age group's cognitive skills and abilities.  Maybe my expectations of Explorer are too high, but if a company makes tablets for three to eight year olds, they need to have a more child resistant screen!\n\nAnd yes, there are child friendly screens out there; come on Explorer make one for the LeapPad2.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "I bought this for my 4 year old because I wanted an educational toy, not just mindless games. I did a lot of product comparison before purchasing, mainly with the InnoTab 2. I found that the LeapPad 2 starts up and loads the apps & games lots faster. My daughter isn't very patient, so this is great for her. I like that she doesn't get frustrated waiting for things to load or start.\nIt was simple to connect to Leapfrog Connect and complete the registration. I like that the buttons are all recessed, which keeps unwanted actions like accidentally being turning off or on happening by mistake. It is quite sturdy, my daughter is tough on toys, as I am sure most 4 year old are, so this is an awesome feature for me. I like that the stylus is attached, I don't have to worry that my daughter will lose it. The touch screen is responsive and easy for her to use. My daughter loves the music app and the Pet Pad. I also like the front and back camera feature, making it easier to use. The cartridges are easily inserted into the LeapPad 2, even for my daughter.\nOne thing I wish had been included is a wall charger. It requires 4 AA batteries, I bought good quality re-chargeable ones, but a wall charger will be a must to buy.\nAnother great addition would have been a protective gel skin. I will also have to purchase one of these separately . I would also recommend buying a carrying case. Overall, this is one of the best purchases that I have made."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "While it was working the leap pad 2 was an OK educational toy for my child.  I was slightly disappointed as the selection of age appropriate games available to go with it is very limited, but as the unit is fairly new I was hoping they would add new titles quickly. Also many of the games seem needlessly marketed to a certain gender, like Disney Minnie's Bow-tique, which teaches skills that would be helpful for both boys and girls, but is packaged in a pretty girl-only way. Not a big deal, but when there are already so few titles to choose from limitations like these start to feel more pronounced. Most of the apps you can purchase are short videos, flash cards, or add-ons; the games are pricey and scarce.  You also can't load video you might own from other sources on to the leap pad2, and if you want to load your child's music you'll need to buy the mp3 player app for $5.  Figure in you're going to want the accessory to be able to recharge the device ($40) because it eats batteries like crazy, and you'll probably want a gel skin ($10) because the paint scratches off easily, and a carrying case ($20).  The full featured games run about 20-30$ and are far less involved and have less content than something you would get from say Nintendo at that price range.  You can see that this thing isn't cheap fun for the kiddies.  It is fairly easy to operate.  With loud audio, a bright screen (although its not the most sensitive and responsive and somewhat frustrating for kids and adults) and a good form factor for little ones it's not all bad.\n\nUnfortunately ours never made it to the two month mark.  We plugged it in fully functional one night, and the next woke up to a unit that would only work when plugged in.  Shot off an email to customer service and they, being the beacons of education they are, fired back an automated response with a puzzle included to try and keep us sharp while the toy was broken.  You can play along at home too!  If leapfrog support says \"Our goal is to reply to emails within 24 business hours. During peak volumes in the holiday season, our response times may be up to 3 business days\" and they are open 8 hours a day (M-T) and 6 on Friday, when can you expect to hear from them?  Is 24 business hours 3 days, unless one of those days is a Friday, in which then you have to count part of the next Monday?  If it happens to be a peak time, are we talking what normal people would call a business day (8 of your business hours)?  If so then why the distinction?  Do you mean that since 24 business hours = 3days according to you, and it might take up to 3 of your days, being in actuality 9 days to the rest of the sane world?  At least while the toy is being fixed we have a multitude of logic, wording and math problems to ponder.\n\nBut how long will that be?  I tried to work it out for 2 business days and part of a third then gave up and called on the phone.  I enjoyed that LeapFrog values my education and betterment as well, as I'm sure that's the reason they hire representatives with little knowledge of English to service their English speaking customers.  Repeating everything 5-6 times does wonders for your diction.  For a defective unit like ours they wanted to make sure we didn't lose any trust in the companies sincere promise to sell quality products, so they sent out their fastest steeds with a box we can put the broken leappad2 in, which will be here guaranteed, by 10 business days.  Yes folks, two weeks to ship a box with a return label in it so we can send it back and wait another two weeks to get a working unit back.  The Facebook support team pointed out they would like to help and it could very well take much less time, we could in fact have a working unit in only 2.5 weeks! Huzzah!  Wait, 2.5 weeks to get us back a product that only worked for 7 weeks to begin with? Had they not heard of the advances in shipping in the past few decades? The Facebook team again stated their willingness to help, and even added some smiley faces.  When I said that help would mean getting a working game to a sad kid in under 2.5 weeks that was the last I would hear from them.\n\nThe real educational value here is for parents, not kids, and mostly when the thing breaks.  I've gotten to converse with people from faraway lands, work on mind bending word puzzles, and practice makes perfect, I can say \"Sorry, Honey, It's still broken, and it will be broken tomorrow too\" like a pro now.\n\nUPDATE: After caterwauling loudly for a while Leapfrog agreed to sidestep a fair amount of their usual hoops and get me a replacement.  It came a week after I sent the original support email, so when they put their mind to it they can resolve things quite speedily.  The entire process was much more hassle than I expected and the customer support system is more frustrating than other childrens' toy companies that I've had to deal with.  In the end they lived up to their end of the bargain, so we're a happy leap pad family again."}

I can't figure out how this can stay competitive on a market like this with all the other tablet options for kids. on average most apps are like $7 versus $.99 for apps with an ipad. and you have to buy the apps constantly; actually you have to buy them like weekly because the kids go through the apps like a thirsty person drinks water in the desert. the apps should be $2-3 at the most.  Some are $25! just robbery! capitalism at it's worst\n\n2. everything you need for the thing is, of course, sold separately.  it only runs on batteries for maybe 2-3 hours so either buy rechargeable ones or you are spending a lot in batteries every few days. the charger and the headphones and the case are all separate and each costs about $20 a piece. just robbery! thievery! if we are paying $100 for the gadget, everything should be included. by the time you pay for the device, the apps, and the attachments, you would have a brand new ipad. in fact, it's cheaper to buy an ipad and buy $.99 apps than buy this thing.\n\n3. this device does not have Wi-Fi. I knew it didn't when I bought it but didn't realize how burdensome it would be to constantly download things from my computer to this game system. it's like I'm spending more time downloading the software and apps that it's making more work for me and less fun for my son."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "I recently purchased this toy for my daughter's 5th birthday based on it's #1 learning tablet claim.  Without buying additional apps or cartridges this toy has very little educational value.  My 5 year old daughter with developmental disabilities has already mastered it in less than a week.\n\nWhen I activated the toy on the website I saw that they had an offer for two for one apps.  This was really exciting to me as I did find the price to be a little on the expensive side but because my daughter has special needs I really wanted to buy it for its educational value.  Leap Frog claims you will have a library of 325+ learning games, eBooks, videos, music and more. Unfortunately, I didn't have time to browse through this library and decided to complete the transaction at another time.\n\nWhen I returned to purchase apps I discovered the two for one offer was no longer valid.  I called Leapfrog and they said the offer is in fact only valid for two hours after initial activation of the toy!  The apps are not cheap and it is very difficult to know just how educational they are when browsing on the website.  Leapfrog refused to honor the original offer stating that I had to have purchased the apps during the initial set up of the Leappad2 Explorer and in a two hour time frame (325+ additional options in 2hrs?!?).\n\nAny company that resorts to these kind of high pressure sales tactics is not a company that can stand behind any of it's marketing claims.  I am very disappointed with their product and service.\n\nMy daughter has an ipad to assist her with her speech and although we have been extremely satisfied with it I thought the LeapPad would be a durable option for use in the car and it probably is but we will be sticking with the ipad as it has a lot more options for apps and ones that you can actually review and does not require batteries.  I would recommend an ipad or ipod over this product based on my experience with its educational capabilities alone not to mention the entertainment value.\n\nI will not be purchasing any of Leap Frog products in the future."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "We purchased this for my three year old daughter in October and it quickly became the toy that she and her older sister had to take turns playing with. We were actually considering purchasing a second one to end the arguments. Now let me begin by saying that the battery life was the only problem we had when we first got this, but that was easy to resolve with the purchase of the rechargeable battery pack. That gave it a really great battery life. Sure it was an extra $40, but I figured we had years of fun with this toy.\n\nThis toy is supposed to be suitable for three year old children. My daughter is not any rougher with her toys than other girls her age, but she is three and she does drop things. Well, here we are less than a year after purchasing this and the screen has a crack from being dropped on the carpeted floor. It had been dropped before, but obviously it hit just right this time. I read several reviews online about how Leap Frog stands behind their product and that they have sent out replacements for units with cracked screens to people. Well, that either changed or they only do it for the right people. The response we got was that a cracked screen is not covered under the warranty, and that there is no way to have it repaired. Basically, they are sorry that their product is not really meant for young children, and perhaps we should just plan to by 2 or 3 of these things every year.\n\nIn summary, if you have at least $300 a year to spend replacing your broken Leappad 2 then this is a great toy. If you are hoping for a durable toy and a company that stands behind it's product, then look elsewhere."}

One niece was 3 and the other 4 when I gave them these - they love the camera and the fact that they can personalize them so even though they got the same color, they are still personalized. They should last a few years at least because it says up to age 9 so as they grow they will learn to use more of the features. Nice product."}

The website loads slowly, updates/syncs even slower, and in all appears to have been put together by people with either a minimal understanding of how to run a website to manage this device, or by people who simply do not care.  We will not be buying another of these.  There are plenty of other alternatives, and I expect they are not run so poorly as this."}

He took his leappad 2 into the bathroom with him and got it wet when he dropped it in the sink while washing his hands. Doh!!!! is what I thought, thinking it was dead because it was good and wet up. $100 dollars down the drain right? WRONG!!!!! I took the batteries out and set it on the vent for two and a half days. Put the batteries in, BAM!!!! It worked!!! I was so surprised because my extra expensive cellphone (in which I got for cheap with my phone plan,lol) was fed to my fishes died immediately. My other phone that had only been slightly wet died, yet this Leappad lived on!!! YAY!!!! I know there is some special reason why it has a better survival rate than the touch screens cellphone and I'm glad too! I also love it because even with his delays, it's still easy to operate and there is no fear of him accidently coming across some inappropriate material as I would if he had a regular tablet. The battery life SUCKS majorly, but if you keep rechargeable batteries on head, you'll be alright. Hightly recommend."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "First of all, I probably wouldn't have considered this had I not already invested in apps previously for my older boy on his.  In addition, I do have to say that there are wonderful apps and a writing tool that teaches kids how to write in a fun format.  Hands down this is the easiest handwriting tool out there.  Not to say that it is 100% all your child will need to master handwriting, it helps them practice and gain control over their hand.\n\nWhile I do agree that this is fun for young kids, there are many other more inexpensive ways of entertaining a child.  Not only do you need to buy the Leappad, you then need to shell out a $40 charger to go with it, or be forced to change batteries constantly.  Then there is the $10 cover so it will fit in the $20 case.  We're talking $160 out the window, not including games right off the bat.  If you include the $5 - $25 games/apps, the money racks up pretty quickly.\n\nI am also not at all impressed with the number and variety of e-books available for the Leappad 2.  My kids love books, and I wish they had more normal books that are entertaining for both adults and children, because I also love to interact with my kids.  I don't sit them down with the video games to get them out of my face.  I look at this as a learning tool and I want to be a part of their learning experience.\n\nI do like that leapfrog has increased the amount of games without TV characters, and this a huge reason why I bought another one of their products.  I just wish they would increase the amount of E-books without them too.\n\nMy biggest piece of advice, if your child has handwriting mastered, this is not the device for you.  Look for a handheld video game or a children's tablet."}

I am not hugely into the whole give kids technology so they know how to use it movement (although i love technology) as i do think kids time is better used by going outside to play and interact (even if it's loud and argument leading) with their siblings! BUT have always been a huge leapfrog buyer and pretty much bought everything they have put out since my boys were little...the leaps in technology that have happened are HUGE...this is a great learning tool for our son(s) and also brought them all together to play and LEARN too! They spent the whole first day making movies and doing skits (which included their angry birds tied with curling ribbon to fly in front of the screen!) and taking photos...when i asked them why as both their kindle and ipod have cameras they said it was just easy to do and the screen was nice and big! It DOES have a touch screen (as that is one concern i had after reading the review i thought it could only be used with the pen). Overall...we are really pleased with it and the games you get free with it are enough for him, but he had gotten extra birthday money and wanted one more app...and we found his favorite music by THEY MIGHT BE GIANTS!!! So FUN! and being an engineer and having taught HS Physics last year wanted him to have fun playing with Phineas and Ferb's Physics App! He hasn't put it down and as most of the reviewers had younger children/toddlers I was worried. Highly recommend this...although wish the ebooks went up to 8&9 year old levels too right now they are great for 1st and 2nd grade even...So glad we bought this for him!

We're currently buying batteries at Costco so we don't have to go very often but I may get some rechargeable ones to solve the matter. It's also quite durable as she has dropped it a few times, held it by it's stylus(attached by a string), and got it damp a few times. I'd also add that it's good for her at 2 years old but likely not useful for those much younger. Also, the games/cartridges that you can buy for it are mostly for ages 3 and up."}

We got the recharger pack because we knew it would pay for itself in no time. He plays with his LeapPad 2 everyday. I have no complaints about the cost of the apps that he's using now. There is NO WAY I'd buy a tablet or IPAD thats made for an adult or older child. This thing is pretty strong. My husband and I see a MAJOR improvement from the time he got it until now. Two months and he is a computer wiz. I am really happy we got this for him. I'm only sad to report that the other day at Grandma's, the screen busted totally, We asked him what happened, and he says it was an accident. He was really upset and he has never mistreated this toy. So, after much debate, we decided that we would buy him another because he has benefited from it so much. I contacted LeapFrog customer service and am very happy to hear that we do not need to re-purchase all of his apps. They will transfer to his new LeapPad2. I only wish that LeapFrog gave you the option to purchase a warranty, but I can also understand that people would misuse it. No complaints from my son, myself or my husband. Price is reasonable so we are going to replace."}

At first we thought it was the cartridges but now we realize it's the unit itself. We have an iPad2 for our 9 year old but thought the it was not appropriate for a 4 year old and this was more educational. The interface to download games from online is extremely clunky and seems to be from the 1980s, certainly doesn't compare to the ease of downloading an Apple app.\n\nUnfortunately, the batteries run out quickly, the recharger we purchased never worked, the cartridge reader doesn't work, the screen resolution is extremely bad, the games are expensive. I cannot say anything good about the unit and urge parents to consider a tablet instead. Even a Nook seem more appropriate as children can read and enjoy games (at a better price)!"}

I do have a couple grievances with them though.\n\n1.) It runs on 4 AA batteries which I didn't notice before I purchased it.  The first set of batteries lasted 2 whole days!  No one in their right mind would have made the ipad without an internal rechargeable battery so why make these that way?  You can buy a separate rechargeable battery pack but it is expensive (just another way to wring more money out of parents.)  We finally just bought some rechargeable AA batteries but it is totally annoying to have to pull the batteries out every two days for them to charge.\n\n2.) The pads themselves are expensive, but on top of that all the apps and accessories to go with are pricey, to the point that I probably could have bought them an ipad and it wouldn't have cost much more.  Some of the apps I think have good educational value, but I think there are a few that are really more just entertainment...not that entertainment is bad per say, but this is marketed as an educational toy.\n\nOverall I am glad that I purchased them, but I wish I had known about these issues before I bought them.\n\nI do like that if I purchase an app, I can download it to both Leap Pads.  I also like that they have made some modifications to make it more user friendly for left-handed kids."}

Right out of the box my little techie in training, started drawing and watching some of his favorite movies (I set it up the day before and went to the App Store and easily downloaded some of his faves).\n\nHe literally LOVES this device, he takes it EVERYWHERE, and I do mean everywhere! You try explaining to a two yr old the ramifications of putting a \"computer\" in the bath tub...it's interesting to say the least lol. I personally love this device because as far as educational tools, it is supremely top notch!\n\nSo, you're probably wondering why I didn't give it 5 out of 5 stars...and trust me....I dearly want to...but...within one day we had gone through 8 brand new energizer batteries and 4 rechargeable ones...did I mention that my son takes this thing everywhere? Lol...well, if your child is a budding techie like mine, you'd be remiss to not go ahead and get the recharge pack that is sold separately.  We didn't have the device for more than 24hrs before I was back online on Amazon, ordering the AC adapter and recharge kit...not that I wasn't going to be on Amazon anyway (yes, I am \"that\" girl...The Amazon Junkie) but I quickly realized that without the kit, we were headed for toddler meltdowns of epic proportions...and for the sake of all that is holy and right, I just couldn't allow that to happen.\n\nSo, if you're planning on getting this device, it is an EXCELLENT choice...just make sure you also plan on getting the adapter/recharge kit at the same time...unless \"toddler meltdowns\" are your thing...but who really needs another meltdown?\n\nYou really can't go wrong with LeapFrog products, so you won't be disappointed with the LeapPad2.

Before buying this toy, ask yourself these things:\n\n- How much are you willing to spend on the games? Majority of the name brand games (ie Disney, Magic School Bus, Dora, etc) will cost you $25 retail EACH (on Amazon you can find them a little less for some). Sure you can find sales but you won't find Buy One Get One. The best you'll find is Buy One Get One Half Off when not Christmas. I apparently go this in the wrong season because Christmas had some good sales. You don't get a price break if you buy the digital copy of the game, either. Finding used games below Amazon's price or B1G1/2 off is darn near impossible and I question why people spend more on the auction sites for the game + shipping than if they just bought from Amazon. iPad games are cheaper at 99 cents to a few dollars and you can get so many more games and some really great quality games with lots of activities.\n\n- How much are you willing to spend on accessoris and batteries? Accessories are expensive. The recharagable packs are half the cost of the Leappad.\n\n- Does computer processing speed and screen quality matter to you? Yes, this is just a child's toy, but at the same time, if you add up all the costs listed above (games, accessories, Leappad), you have probably spent the same amount of money as the cheapest mini iPad. At least with the mini iPad, you get a faster processing speed for really awesome games and video, plus a retina display to watch the movies and other interactive stuff in the games.\n\n- Would you like to use the toy for yourself? As mentioned above, add all the costs, and you've spent just as much as a mini iPad. At least you can get some joy out of a mini iPad for your own entertainment and it connects to the internet. With the Leappad there is a pet game that requires you to connect the Leappad to your computer so you can download the daily food, supplies, etc. You have to connect to the computer (and your computer has to have internet) EVERYTIME you need the stuff for your pet and you are limited to once a day. With an iPad, no worries-- you don't ahve to connect to your computer.\n\nPersonally, I've spent one and half times the cost of the Leappad just on 6 cartridge games and they were on sale B1G1/2 off. If I had bought my Leappad, my total with games would be $250. Then add in the case & batteries (they die really quickly when the kids play), and now I have buyer's remorse.\n\nBTW, all of the games we've played are landscape... meaning that you have to hold the Leappad on it's 'side'. That's just annoying."}

We bought the rechargeable battery pack (worth every penny since it takes FOUR batteries at a time!) and a car charger and we haven't had problems with the batteries losing a charge.\n\nThe most frustrating part is that the games freeze ALL the time, with every single game.  The only way to fix it is to take the batteries out and put them in again, but then of course she loses her game or whatever she is working on.  I contacted Leap Frog and they seemed responsive.  We tried to repair it through their website, but in the end it needed to be replaced so we returned it to Amazon.  We've had the new one for 4 days and we have had nothing but problems since.

Customer service said the problem is with the game and not with the system, and they offered a substitute game.  I still haven't received it.  My daughter still loves the Leap Pad, but as a parent I am not happy.  She can not use it independently because it always needs to be fixed."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "this is the perfect game system for kids its educational, portable, uses regular batteries and charges, is very durable (my son has dropped many many times) and has plenty of memory for there videos,music,pictures (yes this thing has a camera,very cool), video games, and apps which they have many on there website (wish they had at least a couple free ones on there), this thing can also use cartridge games so they don't use up memory when you start getting low. get sponge bob foaming fists its a game kids and parents will love to play together i highly recommend this thing don't get the cheap one just get this one."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "I just bought the LeapPad 2 for my daughter (~28 months) after Christmas and she enjoys playing with it for 15-20min at a time. This is actually pretty nice b/c it creates self-regulated screen time vs. going down the rabbit-hole of apps/movies on the iPad. I was hoping this would break the iPad habit but after playing for a bit she'll often ask for the 'real iPad.'\n\nHer favorite apps are PetPad, the camera and the music app. It's great that the stylus is attached and the design is pretty intuitive, so once I loaded everything I just handed it to her and she's able to play around on her own. Only issue I have is that it didn't come with a wall charger. I think for the price point and quality, it would make sense to include that and just imagine buying another tablet-type device that didn't come with a charger- that's kinda silly. Overall, I'm happy with it and would recommend others try it out (ideally before even introducing the iPad/iPhone or other device.) We are also big fans for the LeapPad laptop and Scout."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "Our kids previously were playing with our old iPhone 3Gs that we set restrictions for & let them play games on.  When I accidentally ran my son's through the washing machine, we were deciding whether to get him a LeapPad for Christmas, or just get an inexpensive tablet with a heavy duty case.  I'm glad we got the LeapPad.\n\nPros\n-Lots of fun, educational apps available\n-No internet access, child can't make purchases\n-You can set your child's skill level/age, games are labeled with the suggested age and they seem to be accurate.\n-Very intuitive and easy for a child to navigate and use.\n-Stylus is attached by a string so it can't be lost.\n-Camera & video camera are fun for the child\n-Leapfrog connect allows you to purchase apps, books etc, download and immediately use\n-You can actually view how long your child played each game, what scores they are getting, and how they have improved in different skill areas.\n-MP3 player app allows you to use this as an MP3 player\n-Front and rear cameras\n-Photos, videos, drawings and storybooks are uploaded via leapfrog connect and can be shared from there.\n\nCons:\n-The cost of the apps add up very quickly.  If you buy the cartridges, at least they have some resale value, but then your child has to keep track of all of them, and can't play the game without the cartridge.\n-Doesn't come with the charger pack, which adds a lot to the cost of the unit.  It should be included.  Without it, you will go through 8zillion batteries.\n-Parent can't set an upper volume limit.  The thing gets LOUD.\n-Mp3 player is a paid app\n-LeapPad2 Didn't come with the story book app, but the \"story book\" section is in the my stuff area, and kept telling my son he didn't have any, and to use the app to make them.  So, we ended up buying the app.\n-LeapPad constantly references \"tokens\" which is something they don't do anymore, and a 3-year old doesn't understand why the thing keeps talking about them\n-It tells him to connect to the computer repeatedly.\n-The leapfrog connect interface is very slow and freezes a lot\n-Play isn't saved when you play under the \"guest\"  user, and I haven't found a way to remove that so the child doesn't play under guest & get upset that their stuff isn't saved.\n-We've only had this since Christmas and have already had issues with it not turning off.  I'm not sure if it is a problem with the charger pack or the leap pad, but it makes me nervous to think about how much $ is sunk in this thing.\n-There are lots of good apps, but it's still somewhat limited.  My son really wants a Curious George game.\n-Camera is pretty poor quality.  Most likely your child will take 10,000 pictures of random things, but in the event that they take a nice one, it would be great to be able to print it."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "Our three year old loves his leappad 2!  He has rapidly learned his letters, phonics, and numbers.  It has been AMAZING!\n\nHowever, the base system at $100 is practically useless, and I would rate it 2 stars.  It is a battery guzzler (4 AAs only last two days or so), so you need to spend $30 on the rechargeable battery pack.  Very few apps come with the base system, so we purchased $50-70 of apps/videos/games quite early.  So to make the leadpad 2 useable, you will spend a total of more like $200 from day one rather than the listed $100.  The initial price is very misleading, but if you are able and willing to budget $200 instead of $100, you will find this to be a fantastic learning tool, especially for 3 year olds with otherwise low attention spans!"}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "I bought the Disney Princess edition Leappad2 bundle pack for my almost 4 year old daughter for Christmas.  She absolutely loves playing with it, however, supplying power to this little device is very expensive.  I have used 3 sets of Lithium batteries, which can power my camera for a few months, and each set runs dead in about a weeks time.  The recharger pack itself, that allows you to charge and use untethered to an outlet is very expensive as well.  In the long run it won't take very long for the recharger pack to 'pay for itself' but it's quite the extra expense when you've already spent ~$130 plus about $20 per game.\n\nIt seems more costs effective to buy a regular tablet (~$150-$250) with a very durable case (~$50) and let your child play apps (~$0-$10).\n\nRight now, I'm not exactly sure the purchase was worthwhile as the Recharger pack is currently listed over $40.  It would be more affordable around $35 or less."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "I got this for my 4 year old daughter as a Christmas gift. She loves it but she is constantly begging to download apps. The apps are expensive. We try to get one here and there. The apps for 25 dollars are full games which i think is probably right around a normal price. Also we have spent quite a bit of money on batteries. I would suggest getting the charger for it. The stickers were not included in the bundle. The case is durable but it doesn't have a strap to hold it on your shoulder. Inside the case it has slots to hold 6 games. The camera has to have very bright lightening to take a good quality picture. She does like the pet pad program and it has taught her to write and recognize letters. I did see a huge improvement in letter recognition  and writing skills within just a few weeks. She is constantly writing letters everywhere now. You have to plug it into the leapfrog connect to download tokens everyday for the pet pad program. What is nice about the leapfrog connect is you can see your child's pictures and videos and save them to the computer. That way you are able to share them if you like. It is durable and she plays on it everyday. She is constantly recording videos and taking pictures. My daughter is satisfied with it which makes me happy but it is costing quite a bit of money."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "This device is wonderful.  My 4-year-old son's attention is hard to occupy.  It's rare he sits through a movie more than 30 minutes, if that long.  He is very active.  The LeapPad 2 has given me the peace I need sometimes.  I work at home and sometimes I need to be able to focus for 30 minutes to an hour straight.  Before getting the LeapPad 2 it was really hard to get my son to stay in one area and keep busy.  Inevitably, coloring and things of that sort ended up on the wall or floor if I didn't keep an eye on him all the time.\nNow, he will sit for around 45 minutes to an hour with this device and be content.  The games and activities are also teaching him things, which makes me feel it's not a waste of time like a video game would be.\nThe LeapPad 2 is also very tough.  He has dropped it multiple times, a couple times on a hard surface and it hasn't had a problem or a scratch for that matter.\nThere are two cons to this device, in my opinion.  One, is the cost of the apps.  Some things are only worth $1 or $2 but they are selling them for $5 or $7.50 and you have no choice about buying them if your child gets bored with the content that comes on the LeapPad. Which brings me to my second gripe. The inability to add anything of your own to the device.\nI know it may make it a little more complicated than it needs to be, but I would love to be able to add MP3s or small video files on to this. That way my son could listen to some of what he likes versus only what they offer you.\nAnyhow, overall I really like the LeapPad 2."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "Our 4.5 year old received her leappad 2 for Christmas. Honestly, it's a great toy if the parents are prepared that the apps are expensive and the child is old enough to use those apps. The games and videos are designed specifically for kids to learn (not all of them but i only buy educational ones). There are quite a few reviews of applications on leapfrog website which makes it a lot easier to pick the ones that are age appropriate and also educational. We do not have a problem with over sensitivity of the screen. The games that require tracing are quite relaxed in my opinion. Of course, the child has to stay in some proximity to the lines but it does allow for quite some deviation from the line which is great for learning. Also, they have promotions for those apps: they had buy 3 get one free for downloadable ones and buy 2 get one free for cartridges until the mid of January. I would guess they will have more promotions. Still expensive but more doable. Some of the good $25 games are sold on Amazon for $15-17 and there are slots in the pink case to put the cartridges in! The cameras are not great but good enough for kids. The battery life is not bad either. We bought rechargeable batteries with the charger from Sam's club and it is not bad at all. They last a few days with half an hour to a couple of hours use a day.\nThe stickers are there, they are hidden very well though.\n\nOverall, we are very happy. Our daughter likes it a lot, calls it her \"computer\". She is occupied during long car rides and basketball games playing and learning, which makes her parents' lives easier."}

We got his new one yesterday and this morning I take it off the charger and the screen is cracked again in the same exact spot. The screen has horrible durability and life. I don't know if it's the recharger pack that is causing it but the batteries get hot if it's kept on the charger longer than needed to charge and I think its honestly making the screen compromise. We're on Leapad #3 for the sole fact of how much he loves it. I've a got a new recharger pack to try but for now I've got regular batteries in it to see if it still cracks.

Plus, my daughter is the only one that uses it, which is probably better anyways as i just give it to her and don't get as mad when she gets it dirty or drops it-thankfully i had the foresight to buy screen protectors and protective gel skin covers). Summary, consider buying this product, definitely as it may fit your family perfectly, but for $200 (when you include all the accessories) + $$$$$ all the money for the games and apps = maybe a REAL tablet would be better value\n\nmy niece loves it too. i bought two of these things (princess bundle). my daughter is younger than the recommended ages for it and she loves it too. she can navigate around in it on her own. she calls it her iPad. well... maybe i taught her to... anyways. if you're looking for a great gift for a child, this is the perfect one."}

(This software is loaded onto your PC and is for interfacing with the LeapPad 2...downloading apps and so forth)\nAfter the upgrade, the software tries to \"Tune Up\" the device.  What it does is CRASH to Leap Pad 2 device; it locks up on the Tune Ups screen and the child cannot use the device at all.  Multiple attempts and reboots do not fix the problem.  The company takes a while to get ck with emails and they are not that helpful.  Given the money that the device costs and the extremely high cost of the simple apps, I'm very, very disappointed with this company and their products.\n\nOriginal Review:\nWe bought this for our six year old boy and he really loves it so far.  It's hard to tell how durable this is going to be.  Sound quality is decent.\n\nTechnical comments:\nVideo display... well it's not retina, let's put it that way.  It's about one tenth the resolution of an ipad, but decent enough for kids. And it's not a capacitative touch screen.  It's resistive.  They are cheaper than capacitative and don't work as work as well.  But again...adequate for kids.  It does function adequately, especially when used with the stylus.\n\nUnlike the Vtech product , this does not come with the capability of playing your own mp3 songs.  You have to buy their app ($5)...And it's EXTREMELY basic... cannot play or view by album or artist.  Just a big jumble of songs alphabetically by song title.  Not even icons or album art to help kids identify the music if they cannot read well.  Simply put,  it sucks.\n\nMy big gripe is that they preload this with relatively little software/ apps.  And to purchase them is incredibly expensive.  The cheapest app you'll find is $5...and there are just a few.  Some are $10.  A LOT are $25!!! For kids games?  The most sophisticated adult games on mobile devices are not even half that cost.  Holy cow!  That's just ridiculous!  Hard to feel good about this whole platform when it's obviously just preying off generous parents.  I would seriously consider getting an inexpensive android 7\" tablet and getting free or cheaper apps.  But its likely that most of those apps would not be quite as child friendly.  Also we wanted to make sure there was no wifi on a six year old's device.  So...a compromise.  We'll let him buy apps with his allowance money if he wants."}

I didn't want to just download movies for him, he can watch those on tv. I wanted this to be educational.\n\nThere aren't many apps for 3 year olds, but he can grow into some new ones when he gets a bit older. He loves it. He loves the roley poley game which teaches him coordination, but also numbers and letters to a degree. There is also an alphabet game that teaches him to write letters - more importantly for me, it's teaching him to draw straight lines, draw circles etc.\n\nwe bought the chargeable battery pack (can't believe how expensive that was) as it takes four AA batteries. The leappad 2 came with four AAs, they lasted for about 5-6 hours of playing, would be my guess. The charger is good, he can play the leap pad while it is charging too (though we try to avoid that). Also bought the gel case. He hasn't tried prying that off. Thought the stylus would be an issue and thought about getting a screen cover, haven't yet.

And there are so many games and movies you can download for it, many pretty darn cheap.  The only problem I've had w/ it came when my not-so-great computer shut down while trying to initially register one of the LeapPads.  It would not play any movies.  Getting help for Customer Service wasn't as helpful as I would have liked (they kept telling me to do things that I had already done).  I wound up having to completely resetting the device and losing all my daughter's saved data.  But it was only 2 weeks worth of game time.  And other than the problems w/ Customer Service, I can't blame the game system.  This problem was completely caused by my old computer and bad internet connection.  My girls love playing with this, watching movies on it while on long road trips and especially love the camera.  Even my 2yr old plays it sometimes.  Wish the battery charger wasn't so expensive, but when you compare against the number of batteries you go through to keep it going, its a reasonable price.  Right now I'm using rechargeable batteries.  Every night, the batteries go back into the charger.

I taught my daughter to calibrate and I called customer service.  I followed their instructions, and defaced the unit because they required that in order to send a replacement unit.

These are very educational, easy to use and understand, and overall an amazing product.  Parents should know that these devices use 4 AA batteries and I've had to change the batteries every couple of weeks, which is the only reason I knocked a star off the overall review!  If you don't already use rechargeable batteries, I would recommend buying some for use with the LeapPad. Leapfrog should seriously consider using a rechargeable port that uses a USB cord."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "A few points:\n1) buy download center cards (wait until you can get them for less than $20)\n2) get a screen protector.  If you don't, you'll be wincing every time your 5-year old starts bashing the screen with the stylus\n3) Get rechargeable batteries or a recharger pack.  the leappad does NOT come with a wall cord so you will be going though alkaline batteries like crazy.  I recommend the recharger pack because you avoid the hassle of having to swap and recharge batteries and you get a wall cord.\n4) the app download center occasionally offers buy-2-get-1-free offers or similar; you can save a fair bit of money using these\n5) You can install app store purchase on more than one leappad (I'm not sure of the limit, but it's at least two).  HOWEVER: free apps you get with leappad purchase are ONLY good for one installation.  These apps are also available for purchase, and if you pay for them they will install on multiple leap.  Therefore, if you buy two leappads at the same time, make SURE to select the same free apps for each leappad.  If you don't, your kids will probably complaining because they don't have the same apps, and you'll have to buy two apps instead of one.  That's what happened with us anyway."}

The LeapPad is sturdy system and the games seem well designed and have high educational value. I like the fact that he cannot get on the Internet. I wish I would have researched the library of games LeapFrog offers for kids 6+ years. It seems like most of the games they offer are for younger kids. He sort of plowed through the first game we purchased for his age range and it didn't seem too challenging. The games are super pricey too. Kind of wish we had looked more into a Kindle, as other reviewers have suggested. In all, the LP2 is a great system and my hunch is that the games are better designed for learning than ones available for tablets. If you are thinking about investing in the LeapPad you would get more bang for your buck to purchase it when your child is a bit younger.\n\nAlso, I recommend purchasing an energizer (or other brand) long lasting nihm rechargeable battery kit.  Kits like that are not proprietary like the LeapPad rechargeable battery pack and can be used for other electronics."}

While a lot of games cartridges that they sell in stores are geared towards older kids, we have found plenty online in the Leappad App store to buy! Not only are their games educational but so are the cartoons and movies and they even have Kids Bop & Disney movie music, which my daughter loves to be able to turn on and dance. Her favorite feature is the draw studio which comes pre loaded on the system.\n\nI originally bought both Leappad's from a big Toy Store and we discovered that my daughters had a big line through the screen and of course when we went to exchange it they were sold out. So instead I returned the device and came on Amazon and found the exact bundle $25 cheaper! So excited. So Thank you Amazon for having the product available after Christmas and cheaper then we orignalyly paid for!

Within a few hours she was playing independently and loving it.  Before I purchased it, I read reviews about it and the one review that I am so thankful for is a parent wrote that before you give your child the LeapFrog LeapPad2 Explorer be sure to open the package and complete the setup and then download the free apps.  It took me a two hours to complete that process (I was a little slow).  That way, when your child opens the gift they can play immediately.  Also, I would highly recommend the gel skin and the hard case for protection and get the battery charger as it goes into the game and you just plug in and it charges.  No need to mess with expensive batteries.  This was the best suggestion I have ever read and will continue to do that for my child for all electronics before I give to her."}

First of all the power button sits out in the open near the edge where the child would hold the tablet. My kids constantly hit the power button by mistake. Even cell phones don't place power buttons out front for adults so how could a children's toy designer create such a flaw? The home screen button also sits out in the open just waiting for little inexperienced hands to accidentally push it and close the activity. The least you could of done was create a depress time, such as 2 seconds to either power down or go to home screen. Common sense people! Also, the game claims to be loaded with many apps. NOT, you get 4 free ones and they are very limited in depth. Also, the system has a parent control page. There is nothing to control except screen calibration, date and time, language, version information, and a few more misc to-do-nothing options.\nI am floored that an industry icon such as LeapFrog created such a limited piece of hardware.

No lie. He got the Leappad for his 3rd birthday and we didn't open it for another month or so. After we finally opened it he immediately took to it even if he couldn't navigate through it yet. A few days later i decided to buy him some new apps since the ones that came with the device seemed boring (to me, at least). One of the apps i got is called The Letter Factory and it costs $10. It was more than worth it since my son became totally obsessed with that video app and he kept playing it again and again. He watched it almost all day everyday until he had memorized most of the dialogue. Anyway, after Christmas we got him new apps and one of them was called The Word Factory app and after a couple weeks of him watching it, he started reading many 3-letter words.\n\nWe love this Leappad2 and think its an awesome educational toy. Just be careful because kids can get really addicted or attached to them. My son takes this with him everywhere he goes and gets upset when we take it away from him. Make sure to get the gel skin protector too to protect it from falls and such. (Ours has a few scratches and chips from being dropped by a child not paying attention to where he's going while staring down at the Leappad). Last thing, is to get some rechargeable batteries for it because with my son's usage of it, we charge batteries pretty much every single day."}

He knew how to play games on an Ipad since 2 years ago, so this was easy for him to handle.  He got a Leapster (The smaller hand-held device) last year and to our surprise, his Leapster games fit into his Leap Pad as well!  (Although he does have to level up with the Leap Pad vs. the Leapster, but its all great practice on his numbers/math and reading).  I wanted him to have a Leapster, so he can do something educational instead of just playing mindless video games where he's running, jumping and blowing things up.  Now he gets to race as Lighting Mc Queen and add, measure, learn fractions and graphs!  I think this system is a GREAT alternative to a D.S./other gaming systems that's don't TEACH your child anything!\n\nThis Mommy LOVES this product and I don't mind my school aged son playing this type of video game."}

Not a smashed screen like from a dropped device, just a thin crack. This rendered the touch screen useless. I contacted Leap Frog and they agreed to replace it. I was told the product isn't under warranty for cracks but they will do it one time. We received our new Leap Pad 2 in about two weeks. I was taking no chances with this one. I bought a bumper and it had already come with the case. My daughter was told she needed to be sitting to use it. She understood that this was a second chance. We stored it up high so others couldn't use it. Looking back, this all seems like pretty ridiculous precautions for a 4 year old's toy! In the meantime, our iPad, phones, etc. are bumped and dropped constantly by my husband and I with not one issue in the over two years we had them. So this brings me to yesterday which is not even two months later but with 6 new games at $25 a pop. My daughter is sitting using the Leap Pad and tells me there is a crack in it. Sure enough, there it is. Another crack across the screen. Like a pressure crack. I am rendered speechless for a moment. Then I call Leap Frog. I explain my situation and they look up my account. I am told there will be no more replacements and I ask for a manager. She tells me to send a photo and she will see what can be done. So now we wait. I'm not sure what is going to happen but I do know I wish I never purchased this product. I am at the mercy of them replacing it again or I'm out $300.00 (batteries included) I can't think of any other product I've spent that kind of money on for two and half months of use!!!!!! SO DISAPPOINTED."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "I bought this device at one of the offline brick-and-mortar stores. I am returning it the next day.\nSo, where should I start?\nOut of the box the device feels very cheap: plastic body, small cheap screen, no charger.\nThe quality of graphics leaves very sad impression: huge pixels on a small, unresponsive screen from the previous century (it looks more-less OK for the year 1999, but definitely not for 2013).\nFirst impression: per it's quality this thing should cost around $29.99 including everything: charges, batteries, protective case, etc. This supposed to be a learning tool , not a gadget to show-off after all.. But it's price tag is $99 for a bare toy. Be prepared to spend another $40 for the battery pack or $50 for a gel skin, uncomfortable cheap headphones and AC adapter.\nThe next thing is applications. UI (user interface) in most cases is terrible and unintuitive. It is ridiculous to charge $25 for the apps of such quality and content. First of all: be careful before buying anything online at their online store, especially apps: there is no 'try' period for downloaded apps; they are 100% not-refundable (they \"forgot\" to mention this on Exchange and Return page at the time of writing this review). Just take my advise: after you register with them online DO NOT BUY anything withing their \"2 hour time frame\" where you can buy 2 get 1 free app! Play with this thing first. May be you will figure out that any inexpensive Android tablet (which is also is a web browser, video/music player, organizer, etc, etc) with tons of free apps for kids from Google Play will fit better your needs!\nThe second thing is the application content: are you guys joking by selling THIS?? Any free (or $0.99, $3.99, etc) education app from Apple app store (or Google Play) has way more educational value than yours priced at $25!\nTotal rip-off! I've learned my lesson. It cost me about $50 for the \"applications\". I will stay away from all LeapFrog products."}

He thoroughly enjoyed it... for approximately 1 hour of play time.  One 'whack' from a soft plastic hammer and the screen shattered.  Definitely not gorilla glass.  He is still learning, sigh, but no thanks to leap frog.\n\nIf you have a 2 to 3 year old boy in mind, steer clear of this product.  In retrospect, I wish I had purchased a DS or similar durable device.  The software that runs on this toy is great, but the toy itself is sub-par.  The battery compartments (there are two) are flimsy and don't seem very durable.  I really thought that they would be the first point of failure.  My advice... spend a little more on something that is more durable."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "I was really excited to get this tablet for my toddler considering he's been playing with my and my husband's android phones. I liked the idea of him having a durable tablet made for kids without ads to distract him from playing and hopefully more interesting than our phones so he'll play with his own toy instead of ours. We also bought two ultra ebooks to get him occupied.\n\nAt first he was really happy to have his own tablet. He played with it for hours the first day he got it. He loved taking care of his pet. He played with the cameras for a while and made some drawings. He played the mini games in the ultra books and listen to the stories. Two days later he got bored with it and was again asking for my phone to play the games he has on it.\n\nTo give him some more activities on the Leappad 2, I connected it again to the computer and tried to figure out how to install the free app that's supposed to come with it. It turns out I can't choose any app I want, like the Cars 2 ultra ebook that my son wanted which costs $20 (which is a fifth of the price of the tablet itself!). Instead, I was given a choice of 5 pretty generic apps. I picked one and that added 2-3 hours of play to the tablet before my son got bored of it.\n\nAt this point I was already very disappointed with the tablet. The hardware is quite outdated. It does have front and rear facing cameras, but the resolution and the quality of the light sensors are quite low. The graininess of the the picture is worse than on my first digital camera from 1999. The screen is nice and bright, but the battery life is not all that great. And then you have to replace them. Or go out and get rechargeable ones and a charger as an extra cost.\n\nThe last straw that made me return the tablet was discovering that I can't just add music to the tablet, but I have to buy an mp3 player which costs $5. This is ridiculous. Music players come included with any new laptop, phone or tablet these days. Charging 5% of the price of the device for a music player is just bad business and plain dirty. Not to mention that there is no way to put videos on the tablet or connect it directly to the internet.\n\nSo I deleted everything from the Leappad, put it back into its packaging and returned it. By adding only $50 (price of 2 LeapPad games) to the money I got back, I bought a Samsung 7\" android tablet for him which can play music and videos, connect to the internet for services such as Skype, Netflix and YouTube and has a vast library of much cheaper or even free games that hold my kids attention much longer and are just as educational (Dr. Suss books for example). Plus, since it's an open platform, I can write my own games if I really want to and play them on the tablet. Added benefit is having a rechargeable battery included and much better hardware from front and back cameras to screen resolution, processing power and (expandable) memory.\n\nI find it insulting to my child that Leap Frog thinks they can sell outdated hardware and overpriced apps to our kids while there are much better solutions already available on the market and much cheaper in the long run."}

My daughter was also excited when she received it.\n\nDay One: The screen starting freezing up, constantly.  This made for much interrupted play time.  I learned that by holding the on/off button and home screen button together for a few seconds, this would unfreeze it and turn it off.  However, this was highly annoying.\n\nDay Two: The brand new batteries we put in the day before, died.  I read the reviews from others saying that the batteries died quickly, but I had no idea it was this quick!  One day?!  And no, she did not use it all day long Christmas day.  I eventually learned that the batteries lived an average life span of 1-2 days, this was even after school resumed and she was only using it maybe 2 hours per day.  Bought the more expensive batteries that last 6X as long, they did, they lasted 6 days.  That was a joke.  I looked into buying the recharger battery pack, but in the end, I had already spent $166.00 between 3 games, gel skin, purse, the unit and spending another $40.00 was out of the question.\n\nSo this leappad 2 was sent back and will be replaced with the Kindle Fire ($177.00) which was my 7 year old daughters Christmas present and a way more practical deal.  The apps are very reasonably priced and with the Kindle Free Time amazon subscription of $2.99/month unlimited shows, movies, books and games, you really can't beat it.  There are also many educational websites your child can utilize through internet access on the Fire."}

I had to run out to toys r us and buy it at 9pm xmas eve.  Amazon was excellent about getting me an immediate credit on my account by xmas day! Unheard of and very much appreciated! That being said I have NEVER had a problem with any orders i think some mail bandit got lucky and ran off with it!\n\nNow for the review: My 4 year old loves this! As do me & my husband:) Educational, fun, advanced and just cool! Some advice: don't but games full price....there are so many sales  on amazon and it's an investment to buy the system itself. Be patient and look for deals! I got cartridges of  Mr. Pencil & Thomas saves the penguins for $6 each when they retail from $15-25! Do invest in the recharger pack, protective case, screen sheild and a carry case. Don't be fooled into buying the leapfrog accessories because they are way over priced. I got a great leather case w/screen shield for $8 from eforcity along with a neoprene carry case from case crown for $3 right here on amazon. The leather case from eforcity is prefect and the neoprene carry case fits it with the case on. Of course only leap frog sells the recharger pack which is about $40 but it's worth it not having to buy batteries. I got it on sale from amazon for $27. It's the best investment.\n\nFor those who say it's better to buy an android tablet for free game downloads thats an option that is of course cheaper. But if you want educational content geared towards prek to 3rd grade it's worth the extra cost. This system allows u to track your child's learning progress while ensuring that the games they play teach them skills that match their learning level. And it's fun without having to worry about them connecting to the internet.\n\nMy advice is to be a saavy saver and look for deals. Amazon often has the $20 app center download cards on sale for $15 or less and game cartridges too. And again get accessories that are reasonably priced. I spent $155 for the system, 2 games cartridges, the leather protective case, screen shield, recharger pack and the neoprene carry case. I plan on investing in the app center cards when the price is right but my soon is very happy so far and it keeps him busy!\n\n Update 1/17/13\n\nSystem is still my son's favorite toy especially after I downloaded afew videos and games from the app center. Got a great deal of 5 apps for $32.\n\nJust have to make a quick comment about the recharger pack. It's been 3 weeks and it no longer works. After some research it is actually not a isolated problem. Apparently Leapfrog support will only replace it for free once. I intend on returning it and getting rechargeable batteries. I found the Sanyo eneloop batteries with charger for $20. Way better investment if you don't want to take a chance with leapfrogs pricy recharger.\n*********************"}

It seems really stupid that you would have to change it to left-handed each time you open the apps. It should be part of the user profile that the parent sets up. If I am not there to switch it, he will just try to do it in the right handed mode that comes up and get really frustrated and disappointed very quickly.\n\nAlso, the apps are ridiculously expensive. RIDICULOUSLY. And there are no free trials, which is also stupid. If I'm going to spend $25 to download a game, I'd like to have an idea whether he will like it or not. I bought the Cars 2 game and he doesn't like it, it was a total waste of money.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "After careful review of this one and the other tablet for kids, we chose this one for my 3 year old daughter for Christmas.  We are not disappointed and my daughter loves it.  The graphics and voices are clear.  There are so many things to choose from when considering what to download/purchase for this tablet.  There's a variety of games, videos, etc for different ages and levels.  The stylus is attached with a strap to the tablet, which is a bonus I didn't realize.  She is finding it easy to use, with minimal help.  It comes with four apps available for download after purchase and hooking it up to the leapfrog website.  The fifth one is the choice of the parents and child, my daughter chose a video that helps teach alphabet letters and sounds.  It's sturdy (because unfortunately it's already been dropped) and not completely slippery (but it's large for small hands) so I'm looking into buying a gel cover to help with the grip.  The camera is fun, front and back, but she is just starting to get the hang of working the angles to take pictures because of the size and placement of the camera (compared to taking pics on my phone which is easier to manipulate).  We were able to choose her age level (early preschool) on the tablet and we can change it as she gets older to help with challenging her more.  My almost 2 year old is already interested in it lol.  I would recommend this product for sure.  It's exactly what we were looking for to help my 3 year old start preparing her skills for school and to challenge her current abilities."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "I purchased this item in October 2012 for my granddaughter's fifth birthday. The item performed very well and she loved playing it. That is until it failed completely last month, December 2012. The item does not power up either with fresh batteries or the power cube. I telephoned Leapfrog Customer Service within a day or two. The cust svc rep was thorough in his attempts at troubleshooting the problem but concluded that the unit must be returned for service or replacement. He opened an incident ticket and stated that within 3 to 5 business days I would receive, via UPS, a Return Authorization shipping label. I did not recieve the label as promised. I waited 10 business days before calling during stated business hours - no one was home - apparently everyone left early to begin their holiday. I telephoned on 12/26/12 and spoke to a new cust sve rep. She looked up the incident number and proceeded to defend Leapfrog's handling of this incident and would send out another label just to make me 'feel good'. To date, 1/4/13, I have not received the label. So I'm out the cost of purchase, and my granddaughter is out the pleasure of playing this toy. You can draw your own conclusions from the above facts but for me I will NEVER purchase any Leapfrog product again and I encourage you not to as well."}

We bought the Leappad 2, a carry case and 3 games. The games are easy but engaging and the interface is simple and fun. She has no issue switching out games and we had no issue setting the Leappad up the first time. The only issue i can think of is the battery life. It takes 4 AA batteries and they seem to last for about 12 hours, although my daughter likes to just play music and dance which may kill the batteries faster.  Fantastic product. Easy to use but fun and educational. And, possibly most importantly, durable (it's already been dropped a few times-we're clumsy people). I would recommend this to any parent I know."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "My nieces and nephews all got this device for Christmas -- ostensibly for educational purposes but (by my observation) also as a means by which to pry them from their parents' IPads. The LeapPad2 has been a major disappointment for all of them. Many of the thoughtful reviews here detail the flaws (and joys) of the LeapPad2. My complaints in brief follow:\n\n- For kids used to an IPad the LeapPad2 is clumsy and limited. It lacks the fluidity and intuitiveness of a grown-up tablet.\n\n- All of the LeapPad books and games are expensive, costing in the $20-$25 range.\n\n- There's nothing special or exclusive about the LeapPad games/books either. For example, a LeapPad  Minnie Mouse game costing $20 is available on IPad for a couple of bucks.\n\n-Yes you can now download apps through a real computer but since the LeapPad2's memory is extremely limited you're mostly stuck buying -- and lugging -- cartridges.  In 2013 this seems primitive.\n\n- There are few LeapPad games or books for kids under 4. Unfortunately the littlest kids are the only ones with any tolerance for this limited device. By the time a child is 6 (at least in my family)  a LeapPad is considered a \"baby toy.\" If you think your investment in LeapPad is worthwhile because it's long-term you may be in for a sorry surprise.\n\n- Unless you buy the $50 recharger  you'll be putting in new AA batteries every other day.\n\n- The screen is too small and low resolution to make art apps the glorious fun they are on an IPad.  Kids are sorely disappointed.\n\nIn conclusion, the LeapPad may have been an ingenious invention back when we were all using PCs and laptops. Now that the tablet era has arrived it's simply sad. DON'T BUY IT. Save up for an IPad or give your kids the less expensive larger-screen Kindle Fire. Either are real investments in your kids. A LeapPad is just money set on fire."}

I was nicely surprised with the quality of the image and graphics. The game selection is great, educational and some just for fun. Connecting it to the computer to set it up was mostly easy. It takes some getting used to what and where to get things updated. My kids LOVE their LeapPads. We have to set time limit for them so they don't spend too much time.\nAnother great experience I had with Amazon's customer service was that we had to return one of the LeapPads because it was flickering after about 1 weeks of usage. I requested a replacement online from Amazon. They shipped it before we even sent the defective one. I was very impressed with the service and the ease of exchange.\nI do recommend purchasing the Charger pack as it saves on the batteries. It is also easy to connect and they can play on it while connected to charge.\nGreat Toy and great service by Amazon."}

I highly recommend setting a clear limit on amount of time spent on it.  I also highly recommend that parents limit their time on it as well, it is addicting. The apps, cartridges, freebies, and accessories are all great!  Very well made and thought out.  We purchased all the accessories such as the gel skin, case, rechargeable battery pack, headphones, etc.. We are very glad we did and find everything to be necessary that we purchased. The quality is almost better than most adult \"toys\" and extras.  I wish I had a gel skin for my smart phone as nice as my son's LeapPad.\n\nHe is 3 years old and within the first 30 minutes, dropped the LeapPad on our tile floor THREE times BEFORE we put the gel skin on!!!  Literally not a scratch, though again, I definitely suggest the gel skin.  Everything is worth it and the interface with the LeapFrog Connect software on our computer is a huge benefit.  You can follow how they are doing, it is great!  There are many opportunities to help your child with various activities (again, also fun for adults) and many ways to benefit from this \"toy\".  I cannot speak highly enough about it.\n\nWith all this said, I AGAIN RECOMMEND the rechargeable battery pack, I do not regret it for even a second.  He plays probably 30 to 40 minutes a day on average (more some days than others depending on what he has earned) and in over a week I have only charged the batteries once.  Super impressive!"}

I have to admit that I am very disappointed in this product.  First the battery usage is insane! The aps and games are very expensive between $10-$25, are they kidding?  Also I think it would be a good idea to buy a bumper, carrying case, headphones, wall recharger, and a few aps.  Well good grief by the time I buy all of that I'm out of pocket $300-$400 anyway, might as well have gotten her a little ipad mini.  Also, it does not run as fast as the iPad and she has already defeated the stuff that is currently loaded on there.  I'm not very happy with it and don't like getting fleeced by a kid toy company. I also don't appreciate the advertising they have on there for other games, I can't afford it.  We got my seven year old a Nabi2 and that has been great!  He loves all the stuff he can do with it and I only paid $25 more dollars for it on the lightening deal.  Overall if your kids have experience with other tablets don't waste your time with leap pad 2 it doesn't run as fast and is expensive for what you get."}

Why would we then in turn by a low resolution subpar app on their market for $25? Resolution of the screen is garbage, the games are mediocre at best, the only use of this device is to play the videos that you can download I bought a used iPad for $200 and filled it with apps far beyond the quality of anything available for this device. The worst part is the price on this device Is the camera. I haven't seen a camera of this quality since the no Kia flip phones from the early 90s when I worked at T-Mobile.

He has been using Mr. Pencil Cartridge and the 'out of the box' limited stuff which is included. I'm surprised at how often we need to reset the screen to pick up on the stylus though (Screen refuses to recognise finger/stylus responses).  Now I see the great potential of this item & lots of people are having a great time with it. Yes, I read the reviews & just had to buy! But............ I had no idea of how difficult it would be to download the essential software to continue using the LeapPad (2) for its intended benefits. I'm not too dim... couple of degrees, know my way around a computer. My set-up is MBP - late 2011. Yes, I've disabled ALL there is to disable, but cannot get past the Connect 41MB download and have immense problems afterwards (download process seems ok at the time, it's all the failed this, failed that messages that I've had enough of). I have tried everything under the www of fixing the prob. Leapfrog's website offers 1 solution - no good. So, what am I saying here? Great product, but you MAY have problems with the computer connection down the line. I remember reading in one review of a mum's annoyance at the box the LeapPad comes in. Agree!  You can buy security boxes easier to get into!  If you are a skilled surgeon you may be able to prize the sides open in such a way as to be able to glue them back down again later, but come on Leap Frog! Us Mums want to be able to set such toys up all nice for our excited kids in order to have them working on the paper-tearing day intended!...is it too much to ask?  I have succumbed to using the cartridges, but extremely frustrated at the download software & support. I have spent hours this Christmas trying to 'fix' this....I mean HOURS!

It blows me away how little you get for $100 and then to have to pay >$20 bucks seems outrageous when I can get lots of apps for my android tablet for free or 99 cents.\n\nThe start up is a little slow, but fine.  The screen sensitivity is fine as well.\n\nLeap frog has done a good job at creating a device with just enough features to make it stand out in a crowd (of other poor performers) for kids.  Then, once they have you they pick your pockets for games and accessories.  They also do a good job of collecting information about your kids by helping \"track their progress\" online - obviously those privacy-concerned folks should not give real names or other information about their kids and probably not even create an account.  Without it though, LeapFrog can still gleam an awful lot of information.\n\nIn reality, no real games come with this device (a picture edit tool that my 6yr old played with for about an hour, and a build-your-pet \"game\" that didn't even interest my 4yr old.  Both of them have played with and enjoyed other (cheap) kid computers, which is why I got the LeapPad2.  But I'll easily need to drop another $100 (literally) before my kids spend any more time with the toy - and probably double that.\n\nI gave a 2 for toy's educational value because out of the box it is zero, but drop a hundred bucks and maybe.\n\nMy kids got it for Christmas and a week later have barely played with it, so judging durability is tough.\n\nLeapPad would need to change to make a few significant changes to get more than a 2 out of 10 from me:\n1) Provide a rechargeable battery (eg Lithium-Ion - like a normal tablet)\n2) Dramatically reduce the cost of add-on software\n3) Provide more (er, some) games out of the box.\n\nSave your money, buy a cheap android tablet with a good cover and your kids will enjoy it indefinitely: far more games (at a fraction of the price), better hardware (screen, cpu, battery life), and much more flexible."}

In addition to these apps she can get books and other learning tools to assist in learning via prepaid card vouchers you can get from pretty much anywhere. Now the bad is that the plastic zipper on the included case broke the first time she tried to store it and the unit itself eats batteries,  and we only use Duracell batteries!! Word of advice,  invest in rechargeable batteries for this unit."}

I added an ebook, a creativity app, and a Dora video before giving this my my 3 1/2 year old daughter for Christmas.  I bought a Jake and the Neverland Pirates cartridge, too.  She seems to really like the LeapPad2, but thus far she has only tried the Jake game and the Dora videos.  I keep trying to show her all the other cool options, but she mostly just wants to watch Dora over and over...which is simply an episode like on TV.  Not exactly all the educational bang I was hoping for in my buck.  I think, given a little more time and exploration, she will find and enjoy all the rest that this can do.  I do like the LeapFrog Connect software that lets me see her progress as she moves through the various elements.  I just wish I would have not installed the videos before letting her get familiar with the other options.  She still asks to play games on my phone, but she does like having her own \"computer\" to use!"}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "I really struggled with this purchase.  I have wanted to get our daughter onto a LeapFrog product for a while, but she has been using her dad's iPad for a while, as well as my cell phone.  We only let the kids play educational games, so I was hopeful that the conversion to a LeapPad would be quick and painless (read: no nagging to use her own computer by mom).  It hasn't been an instant hit, and I see a few reasons why - it is slow, much slower than the response time on the cell phone games or the iPad, and she noticed this.  As well, the screen isn't very clear.  My sister gave us a small Fisher Price hand held computer a few months ago, and this screen is very surprisingly on the same level as that, so mom was a bit disappointed, especially given the huge difference in price.  From what I have learned, the apps are also expensive. Given the cost of the games/apps, way more expensive than anything we are using on the iPad or my phone (all free), I am challenged to say this is the best deal on the market.  Of course smartphones and iPads are expensive, but if you already have these in your home and are using the educational games, you might stick with what you've got.  I was seriously looking for this type of review when doing my research, so if your kid is happy with your tools already, good luck to you.  And I am hopeful that LeapFrog might come down in the app prices or we are not buying any more.  I'm still going to be trying to get her to use this tablet to work on fine motor skills like tracing letters and drawing, but she gets frustrated fast and likes to learn on her own, so she's not into sitting with me to get the hang of this new tool."}

He is very proficient with using my Kindle Fire and iPhone, but I wanted something of which he could not access the internet and that provided greater access controls.\n\nAfter purchasing the LeapPad 2, I wish I had purchased him a Kindle Fire,  this is what I do not like about the device:\n\nBatteries - I did not know I about the rechargable battery pack, so prior to purchasing this item that is made solely for the LeapPad, I spent just as much money on disposable batteries.  So, if you buy this device, you must purchase the rechargeable battery pack.\n\nApplications - Far too expensive.  You get more for your money buying the Kindle Fire or the iPad.  The five free apps that are included with the device are a waste.  He was bored with them after the first use.  Also you have limited applications.\n\nAt the end of the day, he is still using my iPhone and Kindle.  He only uses the LeapPad when we are in the car, but once we are home, he goes for my computer or phone, because his favorite applications are not available on the LeapPad and even at the age of 3, he is far more advanced than the age recommended applications from LeapPad.\n\nYou will have spent more purchasing applications (plus the cost of the LeapPad) than you would for an iPad or Kindle Fire.and all the free and cheaper applications available with those device."}

From a parents point of view though, the the things a kid won't think about, this thing is a joke. First off 4 AA batteries? Are you kidding? To have a toy that is supposed to be like a grown up tablet, and not have recharging capabilities is just sad from a design point. What should have been a no brainer, looks like Duracell and Energizer paid off Leapfrog to help boost sales. Now on to the interface...multiple profiles. Really who has a need for 4 profiles on one of these. I can't even imagine the headache a parent would go through trying to let 4 kids share a single Leappad. Just one profile to gather basic info such as age range and gender would have sufficed, and once it was set up, it should just start into that profile. I really don't think a 3-7 year old understands the different profiles when starting it. At least the kids like it."}

I can't compare it, but I can say the tablet is plenty fast enough. My son (4.5 yrs old) loves playing games, watching videos, creating art, and taking pictures. He hasn't put it down for 5 days. I'm letting him play around the clock because it is a new Christmas gift, but if this continues we'll have to limit his electronics time. I'm already stalking the app cards to put more videos on it.\nThe battery life is to be expected. We use rechargeable batteries, and they last about 1.5 days. I bought rechargeable over the one that you can purchase through leappad. It has a 300 charge rating, whereas the batteries for around the same price have a 1500 recharge rating. Plus to buy a new set of 4 AAs would cost less than replacing the charger even when on sale.\n\nI would highly recommend this unit. I'm looking to expand it and buy the music app so I can put non apple/itunes music on it.

Another downside the apps are way more expensive than the Apple apps which we could have let him use all the ones we already paid for. Bottom line I thought this would be more fun and age appropriate for him and instead I'm out almost $200 for the game, accessories and some added apps that don't keep his attention for a second (or mine for that matter!).

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "First thoughts.\nVery skeptical of this gift from the beginning. It reviewed well for the most part so that wasn't a concern. I thought our biggest problem was getting him to let go of my wife's ipad. Our son turned 3 a month ago and he is a wiz on the ipad. He can power it on, find any app, adjust the volume or fire up a movie. We have a lot of different kids movies on the ipad so that was a big drawl for him. Anyhow come Christmas morning he opened his gift and shouted, \"I got an IPAAAADDD!\" So we just went with it, everywhere he goes we just say, \"Grab your ipad\".\n\nOn to the review!\n\n- Runs on AA batteries or the optional rechargeable pack. This is a huge joke in my opinion. Sure the AA's are good if you run out of batteries then just stop at the store and get more. I'd rather them include the rechargeables and save on packaging and my time. I'd gladly pay $15 more for the leappad2 if it had included these. $40 for the rechargeable pack is a R I P O F F... it's 4 rechargeable AA's in a stamped plastic holder. If they ever die Ill break open the holder and replace them myself. In retrospect I should have bought rechargeable batteries and a nice charger for half that.\n\n- A bit sluggish on the boot-up time. I think it's about 20 seconds. Fine for our son it seems. All the apps and games are snappy on opening. Haven't noticed any hiccups anywhere.\n\n- The touch screen seems pretty responsive with a finger or the stylus. I like the stylus better as it teaches my son to hold a pencil. My one problem in this area (probably software related) is in the pet game you can trace letters to learn how to write them, it's very sensitive so my son wants to give up. He can do all the letters after a several tries but if you draw anything but a perfectly straight line it makes you start over. It's not very easy (for adult even) especially if you're holding the leap pad with your other hand.\n\n- Connecting the leap pad to my computer was also a bit of a challenge at first. I've been building PCs since I was a teenager so I know my way around them quite well. It wouldn't work at all in my usb 3.0 slot (usually blue). Switched to a 2.0 slot and I got a bit further but still couldn't get the firmware to upgrade all the way. Seems like the best method was to install the software and restart, even though it's not required. Open the leap connect software, plug in the leap pad and turn it on. Sometimes this takes several tries. Also if you buy something in the leap connect store you have to plug the leap pad in and just leave it alone. Don't click any prompts or it will stop the transfer.\n\n- Speaking of buying apps....Wait for the deals... They are still very expensive compared to an ipad game or story. Some of the games are $30!!! Most are around $10 -20 but even this is really high. All the game cartridges seem to be about half the price on amazon as they are in target. Either way they're expensive and no doubt it's because of brand licensing, Disney and Nic Jr want their cut.\n\n- The overly priced carrying case works well and it holds six games. My son loves carrying it around on his forearm. The leap pad still fits in the case even with the rubber skin on btw.\n\nThat's all I can think of for now. My son loves it so far and hasn't asked for the ipad once since Christmas. I would definitely buy it again with no regrets. Seems like a quality device. He's dropped it several times and it keeps going. I'll edit my review if something goes wrong but for it now it's great.\nCheers,\nMike"}

The apps aren't horribly expensive, but you will need a computer to sync the device with. I didn't realize it had a video option along with the camera. So, that was a plus. The camera actually takes pretty good pics but the video quality is pretty bad if there is any movement. All in all, my son and I are both pleased."}

I received a Leapfrog toy as a gift for my 3-year old and wanted to exchange it for something more advanced, but the customer service center told me I could only exchange a damaged or broken item and only for the exact same item.  I asked for a refund or credit, but they told me they could only apply the credit to my brother's credit card, and I did not want him to find out and feel bad about me exchanging his gift.  The package came with a letter entitled \"Returns and Exchanges\", but the language does not mention anything about how to exchange a gift or how to do any type of exchange at all.  Completely useless!  I would not buy from this company ever again!"}

I have two main issues: all of the necessary attachments and accessories do not come with it and the true cost is twice what you initially think and that the screen is smaller than expected.  I expected a tablet sized screen, but this was pretty small actually.  Maybe this is because they had to put so much more plastic around it than an adult tablet to keep kids from breaking it?"}

After looking at different options, we decided to go with these.  My husband and I both thought buying a ipad, nook or other \"adult\" ones seemed ridiculous for their age.  Well they are kids and I think these are appropriate.  So far the boys love them and we have had to limit their time.  There are many educational apps, but it is still something your kids can get lost in for hours.  For the price, we are very happy.

He is catching on quick. I also bought the Letter Factory game for him, but I would say it's more talking than playing, and kids at 2 years old need something interactive. So I wouldn't suggest that game unless your child is older. But overall, I'm glad we purchased the Leap Pad versus the Vtech pad.

We bought a game cartridge yesterday and that particular game has frozen the LeapPad on several occasions.

On Christmas Eve I opened up the box and set up the leap pad2 for the first time.  I had bought the recharging power source for this which I am glad we did.  I set up her profile and then connected the leapPad2 to our computer.  Set up was easy to do and soon I was downloading the free apps that needed to be downloaded and updating the leapPad2.  I looked through the available apps to purchase but held off on buying anything and then set the Leap Pad2 aside to charge that night.\n\nMy daughter opened that present Christmas morning and shouted \"An Ipad!\"  She is almost 2 and we have two ipads that her father and I use but that she hardly gets to play on so the idea that she got her own made her so happy.  The 5 free apps are all that she has needed so far to keep her entertained and she has yet to fully explore all the apps.  Her petpad app is her favorite so far, and drawing.  She is actually practicing writing her letters on her own and is amazing her father an I.  She is quickly learning the in s and outs of the leapPad2 so we don't have to be hovering over her the whole time making sure she is able to play.  An ad app was loaded on the device which I didn't know about and made me a little mad.  The next time I connect it to our computer I am deleting that right away.  Hearing an ad telling my daughter to tell her parents to log on to the app store now and get \"said\" app was aggravating and a little tacky in my opinion, but they are out to make money so I guess I can't expect anything else really.\n\nI like that my daughter can't delete apps from the device because that is something she notoriously would do on our Ipad.  I think this is a great learning tool that my daughter will be able to enjoy for years and am glad that grandma got this for her.  I highly recommend it to others."}

Also, the leap connect software used to sync the device to your computer is not easy to use and crashes frequently.  This device should have a WIFI option so a software sync is not required.

Although I knew right away that it was an expensive gift, I foolishly didn't review the product online before opening it.  Needless to say, we are stuck with it.\n\nThe first obvious irritation with this product is the lack of a recharging system.  You are forced to buy one separately for about $30 to $40 bucks.  Of course, the batteries that you put in it don't last long at all so you immediately will get irritated by how fast the 4 AA batteries die.\n\nThe second irritation is the fact that Apps for this device are super-expensive and I am finding that many of the free Apps on the Apple Store for iPad and also free apps on the Google store are as good if not better than the LP2 apps.\n\nThe third irritation is that LP2 is not web-enabled.  So you always have to tether it do upload new apps.\n\nFor a little more, I think it is better to buy a Kindle Fire HD or one of the many web enabled pad devices on the market.  Of course, as I am saying this, the LP2 dropped in price by seemingly half over the holidays, which puts my analysis out the window.  But there are still $99 pads that would be good for kids I think.\n\nOn the plus side, it looks cool and it fits my little boy's hands nicely.  The touch screen comes with a stylus that makes it easy for little hands to navigate.  But he is smart.  He already can navigate our iPad and he wants to spend more time with it than the LP2.\n\nAgain, I didn't buy it, so what am I complaining about.  But I wouldn't buy this if I had a choice.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "I was more excited about this toy then my son was. He started using my ipad at 1 years old and by the time he was 1.5 i had lost a battle against him and could never get ahold of my ipad so i just threw the white flag. He knows how to turn on the ipod, slide it open, flip the pages to the apps i had downloaded for him and start playing. Now that he is 2 We didn't want to invest too much with a regular tablet like ipad because it's too expensive for a 2 year old, and the apps  are just for fun, and i don't want to worry about finding wifi when he uses it outside the house. The apps on the itunes store are not really educational ( except Team Umizoomi)which it what i like about the leappad 2. I can overlook the price knowing that  he will use it for many years to come and learn A LOT. My son opened his tablet on christmas day and i uploaded all his apps and tested the device before giving it to him. The app that come with the tablet are extremely boring so you have to buy at least 1-2 you know your kid will like. Now comes the problem. We purchased the rechargeable pack after i read a review of 1 mom who went through 16 batteries in 1 weeks. The batteries worked for a couple of hours before crashing. We charged it up all night and 4 hours today, and as of now, if i unplug the power cord from the tablet ( which contain the two rechargeable batteries ) the low battery signal will start flashing. My son walked away from this device and went back to kidnapping my ipad again because he cannot move around with his tablet. He loves the game but doesn't want to be confined to a wall plug. In total ( tablet + recharger pack+ accessories + app ) we must have spent close to $180. I could have gotten him a google tablet, a acer tablet, a used samsung galaxy, etc. But what makes me want to give leapfrog another chance is that he has other lepafrog toy and they are all great. Also this is a real educational tablet, and he will learn much more with it for many years. He can use it up to age 9 i believe. That's a lot of money saved. On birthdays and christmas i can just buy him more cartridges and call it a day. I contacted both walmart and leafrog to see what can be done. The frustration comes with the amount of money spent on a defective device, the inconvenience we will have to go through to box , ship everything back and wait for a new device, and see the sad look on my son's eyes almost like we failed him this holiday season. Overall i would recommend the product because of it's educational purpose only.\n\nThis part is for the leapfrog team. If you decided to come with a leappad 3 here are some advices:\n\n1) Can you give the kids a bigger screen? The screen is about the size of an ipod, it's a shame. Give them more space. The device is big for no reason !\n2) Not all kids like a stylus, i am an adult an i never use one. That's what \" touch-screens\" are all about. My son has to push a bit harder on the screen. Apple, and Samsung screen are much more sensitive to the touch and easy to work around with.\n3)PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE include the batteries and charger WITH the leappad not seperate!. You already rob us at gunpoint work with us a little.  It's not only better for the environment, but as you see a lot of parents are complaining about it.  ( or make your next tablet like a apple device , no batteries to buy )\n4) Some of your apps/Cartridges are too expensive. My 12 year old nephew has a ps3, xbox, wii and nintendo 3ds and as expensive as the games for his devices are, he even pointed out that what you charge is too high for some small kids.\n\nAt the end the only thing you are doing is pushing your customers away. I hope you listen ! AT the end what will make me stay or leave Leapfrog is how customer service handles ,my claim.\n\nP.S for the parents complaining about the apps being too expensive, you must be talking about the cartridge only, because when you download the leapfrog connect which stores all your leapfrog devices and kid's work progress, the app store has some nice deals on there. For example yesterday i downloaded a $2,50 Thomas the train video , and some $10 apps. But i agree 100% those $20-$25 apps/cartridges are way too pricey. I hope this helps\n--------------------------------\nBoth Walmart and Leapfrog handled my claim very professionally. Between both company we came to conclusion that the rechargeable batteries were the issue. Walmart is sending me a new pack ( i didn't have to go out of my way to mail the old pack ) via fedex right now. Hopefully those batteries will be better"}

Lower the prices of your apps or risk everyone slowly being turned off of your products. And please don't reply to this with some beat around the bush answer. sincerely- Merry xmas"}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "I have a five year old who is really bored with this product and we have only owned it for 48 hours.  I downloaded the 7 free apps (5 with the device and 2 free found with codes online).  We also downloaded a leapfrog video and a Kidzbop music album.  I figured the 9 apps and the camera/video would keep him entertained for a few months until his birthday. But these apps were all too boring for him.  The only thing he enjoyed was the Kidzbop music.  I showed him the Sesame Street videos online for $5 and he said \"Im not a baby Mommy.\"  I want him to learn, which is why I chose this device but it is too basic and its too expensive to download new apps when Im not sure how good they are going to be.\n\nThese are my major problems with the device:\n1. The apps are boring (too short and easy).\n2.  The apps are too expensive.  They range from $5 to $25.  The kidzbop music was $10.  And I haven't seen them on sale yet.  I guess they won't go on sale since they don't have competition.\n3.  You can't download other apps from other sites.  I wish it worked more like a kindle.\n4.  Also, unlike a kindle it doesnt have a rechargeable battery included.  THIS IS THE BIGGEST ISSUE.  We bought a bundle pack with a case and an AC adaptor (so he can plug it in and play at home).  I thought this was a charger.  I was a little confused because I just assumed that it was rechargeable like EVERYTHING ELSE THESE DAYS!!  So, we will have to buy rechargeable batteries.  The AA batteries lasted one day.  We certainly couldn't replace them everyday!\n5.  I wish they made a screen protector or it came with one.\n\nAll in all this device is too expensive when you all up the cost of the case, screen protectors, batteries, AC adaptor, apps etc.  I could have gotten him a tablet that did more and had more options.  I feel like I got caught up in the hype.  He loved my kindle so I thought he needed the \"kid version.\"  This is NOT the kid version of a kindle.  I think it would be cool to download apps and books and play kid games... listen to pandora... but with kid friendly functions and parental control like the leappad 2."}

The Leap Frog App Center contains poorly rendered games with very questionable educational value.\n\nThe exceptions are full episodes of Sesame Street for $5 ...but at that price why not just stream from Netflix or download using iTunes on an iPad or iPod? At least those come with the ability to download great educational apps for a fraction of the price.\n\nI imagine this sort of product is typically purchased by well-meaning aunts, uncles and grandparents... not the parents who will actually have to help the kids use it."}

I send this to email and they send you message 24-48 hour\" that's not helpful :( next I am ticked that there is NO A/C Adapter!  I got a leappad 2 for my son and while I only spent $100 for his he got an A/C adapter! I spent $140! and what did i get a leappad 2 a case and some stickers!? the stickers aren't worth that much!! but now knowing that I spent $20 for them you better believe i want replacements! You have a green travel bundle that is IDENTICAL to this bundle minus the 2 cent stickers and its $20 cheaper? really does the pink cost you that much to manufacture?! disappointed leapfrog you have totally let me down.\n\nNow onto how it performs.. The picture quality SUCKS. spending this much on a childs toy  I do expect more espcially considering there are cheaper adult tablets that have a better picture quality. as everyone has stated the batters die QUICK! but don't waste your money on the charging pack leappad sells its nothingmore than a duracell or energizer battery recharging system that you can buy much cheaper. My daughter does like the leappad 2 and with that I am pleased the leappad 2 is a good product and that is something that would make me recommend it to a friend it does have many more books, games, videos and apps avail compared to the innotab.  I have heard that Leapfrog has great customer service for returning items if they are broken so I am hoping that if ever we do have problems with our leappad 2 they are as good as I have hear... not really sure considering the language barrier i experianced this morning.. maybe i should have just demanded an english speaking agent... but anyway over all great product just poor customer care and value on the part of leapfrog."}

It was her favorite gift for Christmas.\n\nAs a parent, what I really enjoy about LeapFrog technologies are how easy they are to set up and use. We connected the LeapPad to our laptop using the included USB cable and within ten minutes, we were off and running with it. The Pad is also customizable to your child's learning level. When you create the online profile for your child, you choose their age and grade, and the LeapPad presents them with content based on their age, engaging them at their educational level.\n\nThe LeaoPad comes by default with these applications: Creativity (create your own cartoon sequence), Video and Camera (take your own pictures, make your own movies), Art Studio (draw and color), Music (learning music such as \"Punctuation\" and \"Sticky Icky Vowels\"), My Stuff (where the pictures and movies are stored), My Books (no books are included by default, you need to purchase books), and one free game download, which you will install during the configuration process. My daughter chose Roly Poly Picnic.\n\nThe included cameras are both front and rear facing, so you can switch camera angles from the front to the back with a simple touch of the stylus.\n\nWe already owned a pile of Leapster Explorer cartridges , and every single one worked with the new LeapPad 2.\n\nWe owned several LeapFrog devices, and there were no conflicts with the software on the laptop, this new purchase was simply added to our account and we were able to quickly map our children's profiles to the new device.\n\nI am thoroughly satisfied with this new LeapFrog addition!\n\nFor parents who do not enjoy \"noisy\" toys and games, consider purchasing headphones! In the car, our daughter uses earphones with the LeapPad 2."}

While it's held up since purchasing it in September, it feels a little chincy every time I take the back off replacing batteries, which brings us to...\n\nThis thing eats AA batteries.  It's true that you can use it with a power cord (NOT included) but you can't charge the LeapPad itself.  It would be better if it had a rechargeable battery and the AA's only kicked in once it needed to be recharged.  Unless you're using the power cord though, you're running through the AAs\n\nFinally, the apps and shows are a bit pricey.  Our son's Kindle Fire with the Free Time Unlimited app allows access to a ton of age appropriate content for a reasonable fee.  Not having a Dora the Explorer shows (and only one app) reflects the much more limited range of content for the LeapPad 2.\n\nNB 01.09.14: In the 14 months since we've had this it has held up, and my daughter, now 4 still enjoys it quite a bit (helps the Dora finally made an appearance in the LeapPad lineup).

I bought it as a Christmas gift and figured I'd check it out beforehand and set up his profile and download some apps before giving it to him. Well, I'm glad I did that because I was pretty disappointed in it overall. Here's the bad:\n1-The screen. The screen is disappointing. Its small and very pixelated. If you're used to tablet and smartphone screens, you will find the screen to be a not be up to par.\n2-The interface. I didn't care for the interface, it seemed non-intuitive and bulky and the graphics are mediocre at best.\n3-Batteries. It takes 4 AA batteries and doesn't have recharging capabilities. You can buy an optional wall charger but it won't charge your batteries.\n4-The Apps. The standard apps that come with it are nothing special. A drawing app, a 30min video, a camera app etc. I went to look at the app selection and didn't see much out there for a 3 yr old. Also, the apps are really expensive, some are around $20 and the cheapest I saw was $5. A lot were long videos or flash card based.\n5-No wifi. You have to hook it up to your pc to download new apps.\n\nI spent a few hours using it before deciding to re-package it up. I'm sure there must be positives, however I don't think they would have outweighed the negatives so I am returning it. If you factor in battery costs and app costs, you probably get a better deal by buying a tablet like the ipad or the fire. Also, if your kid is used to using a tablet, they might not find this one very appealing. In short, I don't think he will prefer using this over the ipad. I think maybe 5 yrs ago it would have been a cool toy, but today it just seems kind of outdated and overrated."}

You need a blow torch and a hammer to get into the darn box. Forget opening it and setting it up for your kid and then being able to repackage it for unwrapping fun. Oh and as you are beating your way through the box don't forget to look for the itty bitty sticker sheets. Boy are they hidden!\n\n2)Set up is a little time consuming, not bad but it'll take a bit. You can play with it right out of the box so it's not like your kid is going to be going nuts while you download and set everything. You do need to have the batteries ready to go in right away though. In our case I knew this gift was coming so I ordered the rechargeable battery set that Leapfrog has for his unit. It came with enough charge in it to get her going. I was not thrilled that I could not pre-charge the batteries.\n\n3) Use. My daughter is 3 years 4 months. I was a little worried that she may not know how to figure this out at first but from the way she works my Kindle Fire I figured that she'd pick it up quickly. And boy has she! She is under her bed happily bouncing from one game to another. She picks up new skills rather quickly and so far she's only come out with a couple questions. So far she likes the \"Pet Pad\" best although the \"Brave\" reader that I downloaded is getting lots of play too. I am sure there is lots she is \"missing\" at this point and there will be more to discover as her skills improve.\n\n4) The Case. Case is cute, so far no problems but were many others have talked about a strap of some sort I have to agree. I wonder if the pad will fit in the case if she gets a shock case for it? It seems a tight fit already. Zipper is a but hard right now, may loosen up with use.\n\nAs a whole I am a huge Leapfrog fan. My oldest child is 17 and I've been buying Leapfrog products for most of that time. I love learning and playing going hand in hand. Knowing that she was getting this we did hand down many of her other Leapfrog toys. They have all held up well in the past and we're looking forward to this one preforming as well.\n\nAs we play I will update this review.\n\nUPDATE, so far so good. The rechargeable battery set is holding up well. The camera does kind suck, must have bright light to get any usable picture but she is having fun with it. So far the only thing that is really upsetting us is part of the \"Pet\" game that came on it. Sounds great that they have to trace letters but the perfection of which they must achieve is crazy, heck I have a hard time with some of them. She uses the stylus most of the time trying to use your finger to trace the letters makes it even worse for most of them. Over all we are pretty happy. I'd love to get her some more apps but darn, they are not cheap. So far she is happy with what she has so there is no rush to add more anyway.\n\nUpdate 2 Moving into 4 months of non-stop play! She loves her \"book\" and it has been a sanity saver more than once! I lucked out and got a free download of \"Word Soup\" and this is now her favorite game. She is doing so good with it! It is on the charger right now getting ready to go with her to her Paw Paw's house for the week! Hope they have fun!"}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "For Christmas this year, I wanted to get my three year old the iPad.  He maneuvers mine very well, and I felt very confident that I could find educational (cheap) apps for him on the iPad, as I have before on my own.  A good used iPad runs around $250-300, I believe.  I purchased the Leappad 2 for $99.  Sure, that sounds better, so I was convinced by relatives that the Leappad 2 was a better option.\n\niPad: Only real purchase necessary is a case to help protect it from your child.  Those are pricey... maybe $30 if you look for a good deal.  Plus, you could have a whole folder of premium apps for less than $20.\n\nLeappad 2: Unless you want to go through 4 AA batteries frequently, as it burns through them fast, you must purchase the $39 recharger pack.  If you want to protect the Leappad, you much purchase the $10 gel case.  Then apps... what it comes with, lame.  It came with Pet Pad, which is way too detailed for my three year old anyway.  It came with a video, Letter Factory, as my chosen app.  There are about 4-5 apps to choose from for the free one, and that is the only one I felt would interest my three year old.  It came with Art Studio, for drawing, which is neat, but not as neat as FREE iPad apps for the same thing.  I just spent FIFTY dollars on three games for my son.  I purchased Jake the Neverland Pirates game, Dora game, and Cars game.  In fact, this was considered a deal, as I purchased 2 and got 1 free.\n\nThat still leaves me with no books or videos (besides Letter Factory), so I am hoping he gets some gift cards for Leappad for Christmas from relatives.  I know that in order for him to even like the Leappad, it will have to have choices.  After all, he is used to the iPad with tons of choices for him.  He rotates apps and plays various things when he has the opportunity to get on it.\n\nCurrently, I have spent $190 on the Leappad 2, including all accessories and apps.  Being that my son just turned three this month, we should get good use out of the Leappad 2, but I'm not sure if it will outlast what an iPad would have.  Games average $25.  Yes, there are some cheap games of $7.50, but the popular games like Jake the Neverland Pirates, Cars, etc. are $25.  eBooks average around $5.  Videos are around $7.50, like Chuggington and such.  I haven't looked much at the ultraBooks yet, as my son is 3, and the age range for those is usually higher.\n\nI hope you realize that this will not be cheaper than the iPad, unless you purchase one or two games and never get any more.\n\nUPDATE: 01/12/13\nMy son is hooked on his Leappad 2.  Now I have spent about $100 total in apps, I think.  I have Dora, Cars 2, Jake games.  I have purchased Caillou and Chuggington videos.  I purchased an education music video called \"The Tunables.\"  I purchased the Mp3 player.  The books I have purchased are Handy Manny and Nemo.  The last two are Music Factory and Photo Fracture.\n\nMy three year old loves The Tunables video and has watched it over and over.  He also of course loves Caillou and Chuggington.  The games he likes are Dora and Cars 2, but he has really not even given Jake much of a chance (which would have been his favorite of the three characters).  He does not like either of the two books I have purchased for him, even though he loves Nemo and Handy Manny.  I don't think he puts the time into actually looking at them much.  They require patience... which he never seems to have!\n\nThe very best app I have purchased lately is the mp3 player!  I didn't know it existed.  My son recently found the music aspect of the Leappad.  He only had the Learning Songs that Leappad included, as I had not purchased anymore.  He was rocking out to some \"Pun Pun Punctuation... \" and I found this mp3 app to add him more songs from our own personal library.  This is a huge plus, as everything else I have added to his Leappad has been so proprietary!  I added his Mickey Mouse Clubhouse cd and his Dr. Jean silly songs.  This made it so much more fun for him!\n\nAnother purchase I have made for his Leappad (or iPad as he insists I call it) is headphones.  I chose not to purchase the Leappad headphones, as the reviews were not so positive.  These are what I purchased, and I love them!  Check them out, as you will want some peace and quiet.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007VL90RA/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00\n\nI have modified my star rating from 3 to 5, as my son really love his Leappad, and he finds it to be tons of fun.  It is just pricey, but I feel like it has been worth it thus far.  I have to take it away from him frequently to give him a break from screen time."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "For roughly $130 I think we expected it to be capacitive as opposed to resistive which is what it is. After that it kind of lost all worth for us, our son is very aware of how to use tablets and high end phones so having to switch him to using a stylus and pushing with force seemed like we were sending him backwards rather than forwards in the world. In other words the tablet has great features, but the one that counts most on a tablet (the touch feature) is technology that is so outdated you won't even find it on cheap generic android tablets which incidentally cost less than the Leappad. So basically we are returning this and getting him an android tablet with a rubber case (its going to cost about the same even after purchasing the case) and he gets a much better item with more future potential."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "We purchased this for my 6 year old twin's birthday present. We had heard good things about leapsters and helping kids to learn their alphabet and read, so we thought that it would be have some educational value.\nUnfortunately it has turned out to be quite disappointing. Firstly, for the price of the apps (around $10 for most) you seem to get a very very basic game... the graphics and depth are so far behind other tablets, iPods, DS' etc. I think that the games would be more suited to a younger audience.\n\nOur 4 year old probably plays on it the most, and mostly he plays around with the drawing or photo options that come pre-installed.\n\nOur kids prefer to play on the kindle fire, ipod or anything else... the leap pad is a last resort unfortunately.\nThe camera option is ok, the picture quality is obviously very low but  they do like playing with the options to draw or distort their own photos and taking their own videos is fun.\nWe purchased the leap pad 2 + the wall charger/ battery pack + a $20 app download card. For the same amount we could have bought the new kindle fire that now has the kids app subscription and gotten a lot more for our money.\nI hate that you have to pay so much money for EVERYTHING with this item... on a tablet like the kindle fire you can get so many free apps that leap pad has tried to re-produce. E.g. the pet game on the leap pad has a 'flingflop' option that is similar to angry birds.... but much much much more basic. Or it has a train game that is similar to an app on the apple or androids (you have to make a path with the train line that is all jumbled up). Real tablets have other great options like netflix streaming and unlimited free apps. And all other tablets or devices come with the needed ac adapter included... why on earth doesn't this device include the right basic equipment?... oh thats right, because they don't want you to realise that you are paying $140 for a 'tablet' that should be half that price with all the included adapters.\nI expected more in depth games for my money, and more educational value. Sure, there are games where the child traces letters, or has to pick a number out of a selection of three numbers, but these are all too young for 6 year olds.\nI wish I had listened to my gut instinct when I first looked at the leap pad and thought that it looked too young for my kids and too expensive for its outdated technology.\nSave your money and get a kindle fire or a curio that has pre-downloaded kids apps.  I just wish someone had told me all this before I bought it."}

So from their standpoint, I'd say it probably gets a 4 or 5. I do, however, see our three-year-old get extremely frustrated with the letter-writing game. It requires total perfection, and the screen/pen calibration seems touchy (i.e. it doesn't keep up with him). I appreciate the lesson, but I do question the execution. We're trying to help our son with handwriting in other ways; it's just hard to see him get so frustrated doing something that should be fun.\n\nAs for our wallet, the games seem really expensive, and I've admittedly been too cheap to buy any cartridges yet. Using rechargeable is a pretty big deal with this thing, too; otherwise, you'll zap a ton in batteries before you know what hit you.\n\nThe kids don't really play with it that often--maybe once or twice a week, and it serves a purpose.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "I was hesitant about purchasing the Leappad2, but I was glad that we made the investment.  I have 3 boys, Ages 5, Ages 2 and 2.  My 5 year is use to playing with an ipad so was not sure if he would enjoy using a leappad, but suprisingly he often prefers it over the ipad now.  My twins boys learned how to use the leappad probably after about 5-10 times.  They've also thrown and dropped the leappad many a time, and it has withstood  the drops with no problems.\n\nThe biggest issue I had with the leappad was the price of the apps and the cartoons.  They recently increased the selection of videos and cartoons sometime in October I noticed.  For example, they know have shows like Dinosaur Train which my kids love.  Even though the cartoons are expensive (compared to say the ipad), the one good thing about it is that all of the shows have educational value such as Word World and also the leapfrog abc video factory videos.  I know that when my kids are using their leappads, they're almost always  learning something, whereas when they're using the ipad that's just not the case.  Even though the initial investment for apps is quite large, we have 2 leappads, and we only had to pay for the apps once(you can sync to 3 leappads), and we'll now always have them.\n\nI look for amazon leapfrog card deals so now we only purchase apps at a discount.  Overall, this is a very good product, and the reason I'm giving it 4 stars is due to the price of the apps.  It also is great for car rides and good at keeping all of my kids' attention for long periods of time."}

This is the 5th Leapfrog product that we have purchase over the years, and I could not be more disappointed.  As soon as you turn on the product, it says to connect to your PC to download the games and register the product.  Let the frustration begin.\n\nI have Leapfrog Connect application on my PC.  It works for all 4 of the other Leapfrog products we have.  This Leappad2 will not recognize the Connect application.  I have been on the phone with customer support 2 times and they have told me to do the same thing twice that has not worked.  I have turned off my anti-virus software and my firewall completely to try and connect it, but still to no avail.\n\nWe are a tech savvy family.  Everyone has their own devices that hook up all sorts of different ways.  This has been a nightmare.

He just wanted to play with our iPad which he was very accustomed to.\n\nOur main reason for buying this product was so our son would use it instead of our iPad.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "Are the games and apps a ripoff, you bet!  But that is the idea--you are buying into a system and once you do they've got you.  It is a monopoly at that point and Leappad takes full advantage of it.  The apps probaly cost $1-3 each to make and they whack you up to $25 for each one.  It's not to different than buying one of the new coffee machines where you can only buy the coffee packs from the manufacturer.\n\nThe Ipad and Android tablets are good but let's face it they are not specially made for learning or for kids and you are literally on your own to find the right apps for your kid, that are age appropriate, fun, and teach the right material.\n\nLeappad is a major ripoff and they've no problem putting the screws to you by charging ridiculous prices such as $35 for a charging pack, and yes the camera, video and resolution leave a lot to be desired.  But it is made to be kid-friendly and if your kid drops it, it was $99 instead of a $500 Ipad.  It is also light enough and small enough for a kid to carry.\n\nIn short, you've two choices if you want a kid's tablet: Leappad 2 or the Vtech.  Of the two the Leappad offers a little more although it is more expensive.  If you compare the specs to an Ipad or Android tablet of course you're going to be disappointed.  It would be like comparing a moped to a Corvette.  However, if you realize you are only looking for a learning/ entertaining toy for your kid, Leappad is a decent choice with a good deal of apps.  It is tough for a kid to break and pretty easy to use.  While the specs are lousy, it is much better than last year's model and better than the Innotab.  It also is a good tool to prepare them for a tablet in the future.  Hopefully your kid will learn some great things with it, and try to look for the few sales that Leappad offers on the apps.

Leapfrog should at least include electric cable with device.  Also found some apps and ebooks too expensive.  Finally, surfing the website could be easier. The big plus is that it helps kids build reading skills provided you put some ebooks in there."}

It uses AA batteries and we haven't even used it yet and it says the batteries need to be replaced???  (we just put new ones in).- why wouldn't it come with a charger like all electronics these days?!?!?!  Getting it set up took a few times- we couldn't get the leappad to update but that seems strange, its brand new!!  We bought this because we don't want our daughter playing with our ipad and clearly the ipad is leagues ahead of this product."}

I bought the princess package and when I took it out of the package I couldn't believe how lite it was. It was very cute though. Placed brand new batteries in it turned it on then it kept shutting of saying batteries low. Had to wiggle and mess with batteries for 15 min before I could get it to stay on.  Gave me a very bad feeling about the products durability. Needless to say I returned it immediately  Glad I tested it before placing under the tree"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "I bought the LeapPad2 for my daughter's 3rd birthday.  She really likes it and wants to use it constantly, so we've had to limit her time with it.  It comes with a small number of apps that you can download.  Before using it, you need to connect it to your computer and initialize it at the LeapFrog website.  It's not that much of a hassle, but it does take a little time.  I definitely recommend doing this before showing it to your child, otherwise you'll have an impatient toddler looking over your shoulder while you wait for the software to download.  It took almost an hour for me to go through the process.  I installed all the software, then wrapped it up to give to her.  She didn't seem to mind that I threw away the packaging.\n\nThere are 2 cameras, one forward facing and one rear facing.  The resolution isn't great, but it's good enough for your kid to play with.  After taking a picture, there is an app for modifying it by adding little graphics and artwork to the photos.\n\nI took 1 star off because of the cost of the apps.  Anyone who has an iPad or other smart device is used to going online and buying apps for a dollar or so.  It was a bit of a sticker shock when I found out the apps were in the $20 range.  It can be pretty disappointing to spend that much on an app just to have your kid get bored of it in a few minutes.  Some of the apps have more to them and some are more simple.  It would be nice if they were priced accordingly.\n\nOverall it's a good product, and helps keep my kids' hands off of my smartphone."}

One issue I had is that they don't put bubble wrap between the cardboard and the leapPad to keep it from getting damaged when the delivery guy decides to throw the box over the gate and onto the porch.\nYou do need between 1-2 hours to get it set up. If you got it for a Christmas present, and you want to set it up before that day, be careful how you open it. The box is folded in weird ways not like a normal box than it has tape on the other folds.\nYou have to download/install LeapFrog software from the Leap Frog web site for your computer then connect it using a usb wire, it comes with one but it is really short. You can choose to buy LeapFrogs rechargeable batteries or buy a different set at the store. It takes 4 batteries, so if you buy your own batteries, It would be a good idea to have at least 8 rechargeable AA batteries.\nWhen you turn on the leappad, it ask a few questions about the child to set up their first profile. After you connect it to the computer, it might install an update to the software, depending if one is available. The program lets you pick one or 2 free Apps for the leapPad. They charge you for all the other apps in the shop.  I'll find out later if she likes the LeapPad."}

So I decided to move to my Mac and began to download, but the program closed after every time that a game was 100% and then it closed numerous times when it was trying to update.

Another order was just changed to below the free shipping price without asking me and sent out with shipping for a partial order.  People who barely speak English operate customer service off shore.  If this is how they treat ordering customers, I would hate to know how customers calling in for product issues are taken care of.  This saga has been going on for over a week now and has turned me into a staunch V-Tech buyer.

This works well for me as LeapPad is not just a game system but an educational product, so while they are having fun they are also learning. Another feature this product has that none of the others have is a 2-sided camera and bonus software that make it possible for them to record and star in their own cartoons with their own faces and voices. What a hit that is! If you are looking for a gift for a child aged 3 to 10 I would recommend this!

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "This is a nice toy, and they've made some improvements since LeapPad 1. The front and back camera option is especially nice. I was very excited to see that this bundle came with a Disney theme. But now that I've gone through setting it up and testing it out, I'm really not that impressed. With it's price tag being what it is ... in hindsight I wish I'd just bought a regular tablet for my daughter - like the Kindle fire.\n\nFirst, a note ...\n\nSTICKERS: Like someone else mentioned, I also thought the stickers were missing and was disappointed. THE STICKERS ARE THERE! Just as I was taking all the packaging out to the recycling bin, I found them. MAN! They are hidden WELL, but they're there. There are two problems. First, the sticker \"sheets\" are probably much smaller than what you think you're looking for (they're only about 2\"x3\"-ish), and second ... they're HIDDEN! They're inside one of the many, many folded cardboard compartments and sealed up with tape. Honestly, it's a terrible place to put them - I'll bet half of parents will throw them away not knowing where to find them. But if you read this -- keep looking! They're there.\n\nNow, some issues ...\n\n1) TOUCH SCREEN: It's not all that receptive/reactive to touch. You're better off using the stylus, but for the younger crowd, that could get a little frustrating. I was buying this for the touch-screen aspect, so this is disappointing.\n\n2) THE CASE: Yes, the case could use a redesign. It's CUTE, but ... there's no strap or elastic for the pad, so when this thing is unzipped by little hands, the LeapPad is undoubtedly going to fall out. The other side of the case is designed for a spare stylus and cartridges. If you, like me, are going to download the apps from the app store and have no intention of using cartridges, this will be useless for you. I'd rather they included a place for headphones. Also, if you have a younger child (3), note ... the case is not super easy to zip/unzip. It's not impossible, but ... the stiff zipper might be a little tricky for tiny hands.\n\n3) BE PREPARED - THE APPS ARE EXPENSIVE: If you're expecting $1.99 apps (like on iTunes), don't. The cheapest app I've seen was $5 and the \"good\" games are about $25 each. It's going to cost you some cheddar to fill this thing up. After selecting just a few apps to get started, I viewed my cart and saw I was already over $100 ... which made me wonder if I should've just sprung for an iPad mini. Also, note, with this bundle when it says you get to pick an app, you don't get to choose any app you want out of the app store. You must pick one of four specific apps.\n\n4) LACKLUSTER VIDEO QUALITY: For $7.50 each I downloaded some video apps of Nickelodeon shows (Fresh Beat Band, Dora, etc.) I just tried them out ... ugh! I'm not pleased with the resolution / screen quality. I mean, it's okay - but ... not great. I was hoping the LeapPad 2 would be a little nicer in this area. Not so much.\n\n5) NON-REMOVABLE ADS!?!? Okay, I bought this thing, I paid through the nose for apps ... why is there still a \"Leap Frog Sneak Peaks\" ADVERTISEMENT permanently on the screen for my daughter to click on??? Seems wrong. I'm annoyed by that.\n\n6) ON THE HEAVY SIDE: I put the four AA batteries in this and ... it's pretty heavy. Not terrible, but - I have a feeling little three year old hands are going to get tired out from this.\n\n7) CREEPY MP3 ERRORS: I got the MP3 player app so that I could load my daughter's favorite songs onto the pad. I loaded a batch of perfectly fine MP3s - all encoded the same - all of which work properly on the computer or on my own mp3 player. HOWEVER - once they got onto the LeapPad, some of them (randomly) only play SUPER slow with low low voices - like CREEPY low. Scary! Doesn't seem to be much rhyme or reason to which ones aren't playing properly. I loaded 63 songs - 22 worked okay, the other 41 have this playing slow issue. :( Also, the player leaves much to be desired. It's not graphical at all, so if your child doesn't read yet, they'll have no visual identifiers to help them find the songs they want. And even if they DO read - the screen only shows about 20 characters, so if the song title is long or shows the artist's name first, it may become impossible to identify the songs (if you've got several songs by the same artist with more than 20 characters in their name, the song titles will be pushed off the screen and you can't see them.)\n\n8) CAN'T LOAD VIDEO? The computer interface allows you to upload mp3s (not that they actually work on the other end ... see above), but it doesn't seem to allow you to upload videos into the LeapPad. I'm guessing this is because they want to make sure you're purchasing videos from the app store.\n\n9) SCREEN REARRANGES? I took the time to move all the tiles around so that the apps I think my daughter will like best appear on the first screen. By the way, you can't do this on the computer interface, you must move each app icon on the LeapPad itself. At any rate, I took a few minutes and did that, and about 10 minutes later (after I'd explored a few of the new apps) I noticed that some of the app tiles had rearranged themselves and moved to different screens. ? Not sure if that was a fluke. I hope it's not an ongoing thing. It's going to really confuse my daughter if the apps are moving around all the time. :(\n\nHope that helps! Don't get me wrong, it's a nice little toy - these are just a few observations. If I had known all of this before I purchased it ... honestly, I probably would've gone with a Kindle Fire or an iPad mini instead. I think it would've been worth it in the long run, especially considering how much the leappad apps cost. C'est la vie!"}

I will say my 5 year old son LOVES his LeapPad and will play games on it as much as I'll allow.  I would like to add a comment about batteries: the LeapPad does burn through batteries, although not as quickly as I feared.  With an hour or so use each day, I probably swap out batteries once a week.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND buying Sanyo Eneloop rechargeable batteries.  They are less expensive than the LeapPad battery pack, which of course can only be used with this product.  And they are MUCH better than the Duracell or Energizer rechargeable batteries sold at most stores.  They come in AA and AAA sizes, and hold their charge just as long as a traditional battery. With kids and battery-operated toys in the house, I swear these were one of my smartest purchases.  You can buy them here at Amazon and also at many Costco stores. Get at least 8 AA's so you can have one set of 4 charging while the other set of 4 is in the toy. With one set in the toy and one set charged and ready to go, we can easily make it through a long car trip (there and back!) so no need for the car-charging adapters Leapfrog sells.\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Sanyo-NEW-1500-eneloop-4-Pack-AA-Ni-MH-Pre-Charged-Rechargeable-Batteries-with-Charger/dp/B004RP2VNI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Sanyo NEW 1500 eneloop 4 Pack AA Ni-MH Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteries with Charger</a>"}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "I think this product is really expensive for what you get. $99 with 5 apps, but the apps they include seem to be for really little kids. Our 6 year old got tired of the included apps within 2 days, and when you go to the App Center you see games like Disney's \"Cars\" or \"Brave\" going for $25, and really generic no-name apps are going for around $5 - $10.\n\nOn top of that, the product goes through \"AA\" batteries pretty quickly, however LeapFrog will sell you a recharger option for the low low price of ~$40. That, and you need the leapfrog.com connect USB cable to connect the device to the computer -- no other USB cable will work, so if you lose that you will need to order a replacement from LeapPad.\n\nI wish we would've saved our money and went with an iPad mini -- the apps are much cheaper, don't have to fool around with batteries, and it can grow with the child."}

If your kid opened the case while standing and wrongly rotating the case while opening, the device will diffidently slide down and break. It will be better design to have a small inside belt to have the LeapPad fixed .\n\n[2] The  princes stickers mentioned to be included in this bundle WERE NOT there !!.That was disappointed for her, but I told her that they were sold out because we missed the offer.\n\n[3] Games/Tools  are ok, for example the letter drawing, she likes the granted stars after the successful drawing of the letter."}

It is a fun and educational toy but if you want to load your own personal music on the device you have pay $5.00 for the app to do it. It is mp3 formatted so if you do download the app you still have to convert the files if you store your music on windows media player which stores them as wmf files.  Also there is no way to load personal photos on to it either.  For $100.00 I think both of these features should have been included as they are on the innotab which is $20.00 cheaper.  If I were to purchase again would definitely go with innotab after having both for the value."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "I bought each of my sons (age 6 and 8) one of the LeapPad 2's. I was excited by the selection of apps and online books to download, they love the Wordworld series and others available. They loved the devices and had a lot of fun with them (we didn't know to get the rechargeable battery pack kit so we went through 16 AA batteries in one weekend). After five days my younger son's Leappad 2 refused to turn on. It won't run on batteries or the rechargeable battery kit. He's really disappointed and begs for us to fix it. Now today my older son's Leappad2 won't hold a charge using the LeapFrog charger system. I had purchased these because I thought they would be a better bet than a Nintendo DS, but I'm starting to think I chose the lemon. Really unhappy about all the trouble, as as much as my children enjoyed the LeapPad2, I'm the one getting the headaches of the contraptions not working properly and hearing my little guys complain. I've spent about 250.00 for the things plus rechargeable kit, they should be working properly a lot longer than they have. I have to add they haven't been mishandled either, they play them in one carpeted place in our playroom. I have a Vtech Vsmile pocket that is still going strong after 4 years, maybe I should have invested in the Innotab instead."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "Leapfrog has always been one of the front runners when it comes to children's educational technology. Now they bring you their second generation children's tablet, the Leapfrog Leappad Tablet2. The Leappad2 is a children's educational computer tablet. The tablet is touch screen compatible, it comes with two magnetic styluses (which is attached to the tablet itself) and a USB adapter so that you can connect it to your PC and download applications directly from the Leapfrog Server Website.\n\nThe tablet is lightweight and easy for a child or adult to carry from place to place. It is backwards compatible with all Leapfrog Explorer cartridge games as well as all the original Leappad downloads.  The Leapfrom Downloads are extremely child friendly and great for any child ages 3-10.  My 5 year old daughter absolutely loves this and plays it a couple hours a day, as well as my 2 year old son. This has not only increased both of my children's vocabulary but has taught my daughter how to trace letters and now she's writing very well.\n\nI absolutely love this as an extra educational aid, however there are some minor issues. One is that the battery life is only 8 hours so buy the AC Power Adapter and Car Adapter (both sold separately) immediately after purchase to cut your bills on batteries. Rechargeable batteries also are a good option. One thing to note is that if you get an AC adapter/Car Adapter neither actually charge the Leappad2, it just keeps the batteries from draining.\n\nSo what's the difference between the Leappad 1 and Leappad 2? Well The Leappad 2 comes with front & back cameras/video recorders, as well as 4gb of memory versus the 2 gb you got with the previous Leappad. Everything else is exactly the same.\n\nI still have also had some technical problems with loading apps or Micromods (game expansions) onto the pad itself, and sometimes apps go missing. All I can say is that the Leapfrog customer service is extremely friendly, organized and prompt when answering technical issues and will sort any problems out you may have. They will even reinstall your programs for you if worst comes to worse.\n\nOverall I highly recommend this to anyone who has a child, nephew, niece, grandchild! This is a very fun, positive, educational and your children will love it and never put it down!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "I bought this for my nephews. They are 9, 7 and 5. Of course before giving it to them, I had to open it and check it out. Let me tell you that I played with this \"toy\" for hours - literally. Omgosh I wanted one for myself. I could not put it down. My husband annd kids thought I was crazy. I am 35 years old and am so completely impressed with (and entertained by) the LeapPad2. I wish they had these when my own kids were younger (youngest is 14 now). I swear this is THE cutest and most beneficial \"toy\" I have ever come across. If you can afford it, by all means it is an excellent investment on so many levels.\n\nFirst, it is so very well made. It is durable. You will notice that as soon as you hold it. I wouldn't go thrashing it onto the concrete, but I bet this thing will withstand alot of abuse and years and years of use. It is not a delicate toy that you have to worry about the child's every move with it.\n\nThe camera is so much fun for the kids. It's picture quality isn't the best, but it is definitely doable and ok for the kids. Picture quality is about that of VGA cell phone camera quality. It takes pics the best in well lit areas. The kids will have fun with it no matter what though, gauranteed. The app for the camera allows them to edit the pictures into creations and do \"fun stuff\" with them. I think that alone keeps kids occupied for awhile. What kid doesn't like taking pictures and feeling like they are doing something the older kids and adults are doing? They can make their own videos too.\n\nIf you can't buy extra apps or games right away, the preloaded ones are enough variety to keep them occupied. Like I said - they kept me occupied for hours! The roly poly game is the cutest thing I have ever seen and I was hooked on that lol. The music app is fun. The drawing app is fun as well - they can do what they want without having to follow a guide, it is free play. The boys love the LeapPad and of course do some fighting over it. It appeals to all 3 of them, even the oldest who is 9. I just cannot express how versatile, fun and beneficial this system is.\n\nIt promotes hand eye coordination as well as a breadth of other learning skills - reading, math, etc., plus incorporates fun into all of it. It is very easy to use, even for the younger ones. Absolutely a great product that will last through years of use and will not be outgrown too quickly. You can get apps and games that are perfect for a nice span of ages. Highly recommended!"}

The least expensive one we have seen is $7.50. The ones that it comes with are okay but I can see her getting bored with them very quickly. My daughter has worked with it more than I have but she says that the LeapFrog 1 comes with the ability to import your own music to it, this one does not. Our girl has lots of favorite songs and that is one thing she is always taking our phones for. As for durability, the jury is still out although our granddaughter did drop it on the cement floor and it was okay so that was a good sign."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "Let me start this review saying that I know that my 5 year old is ahead so this review will be on 2 different points of view.  For my eldest, this game was shiny and new and cool... but within a week had beat all 12 levels of the Phineas and Ferb game which was supposed to be the more advanced games.  Not a big deal you say?  Well that game will run you about $25 and is not one that comes with your purchase.  It also matters because this toy is rated to be for ages 9 but I do not think that that number is realistic.  Not to mention most games, books and aps are focused for kids ages 4-6.  So it is neat, it is certainly better than the Fisher Price IXL that he had but worth $100?  I am really questioning the investment for a 5 year old.\n\nMy 3 year old on the other hand loves it and it seems to keep him entertained with no issues whatsoever.  I do wish that you could load music onto it for them to play without having to pay for an app to do such things.  The aps are usually about $7-10 and the games are cheapest here on Amazon.\n\nBottom Line:\nIt is cool and a neat thing for a 3-4 year old but much older than that and it just cannot compete with a computer or video game system.  Not that I recommend those for kids, but my 5 year old enjoys playing games on PBS.com more than this.  Just another view point."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "If you want a child-friendly tablet-style device, this is the best one on the market as of October 2012. But you have to understand what you're getting and why this is desirable. There are a lot of positive reviews that are a bit inflated, and many negative reviews that are simply unfair in their expectations. Here's my realistic parent-friendly review...\n\nFirst, the LeapPad is more rugged and more child-friendly compared to an iPad, iPod, or Android tablet. I know parents who prefer to let their kids play apps on those more sophisticated devices, but if you go that route, you're taking a risk with a more expensive and more fragile device. You're also opening up a potential can of worms since those devices usually include unrestricted access to the internet (which may expose your child to inappropriate material or allow him/her to accidentally make purchases, etc.). The LeapPad's more durable casing allows young children to hold and carry it with less likelihood of damage. Since it has a fairly wide bezel all the way around the screen, it also offers space for a child to rest his/her palm when writing with the stylus, with fewer \"false taps\" that can occur when their palm or fingers touch the screen instead of the stylus. And, of course, since it is not wireless-connectivity enabled, you don't have to worry about your child stumbling across objectionable content or making accidental purchases. You control the content on the device by syncing to your computer and deciding what to install (the sync cable is included, and plugs into a standard USB slot on your computer).\n\nSecond, the LeapPad is much more responsive than any of the other child tablets we've tested. We bought our 2.5-year-old daughter a FisherPrice iXL, which was cheaper and came with 6 very basic apps that we thought would be plenty sufficient. However, after a few weeks, she was still struggling to learn how to use the apps due to noticeable lag/unresponsiveness during screen taps. The inconsistent results when she interacted with the screen made it hard for her to learn the interface. Sometimes tapping an icon would do what she wanted, but often, multiple taps would not produce the desired effect. Often, she had to ask \"Daddy can you help me draw?\" or \"Daddy can you help me play music?\" in order to access or use a program. When she tried a friend's LeapPad1, however, it was noticeably more responsive, allowing her to understand the interface MUCH better. When we purchased a LeapPad2 we were delighted to find that it's even snappier than the LeapPad1. Within a few hours, our daughter had mastered how to access all of the applications and she also understood about 50 - 60% of the more advanced functions within each program (such as choosing the small, medium, or large eraser in the Art Studio drawing program). I'm certain she learned it so quickly because the screen and stylus respond faster and more consistently (about 95% of all taps register correctly, even in the hands of our 2.5-year old).\n\nThird, the LeapPad has a decent array of basic apps/features already included. When you unbox it, you'll need to install four AA batteries, create a new \"profile\" for your child, then connect to an Internet-connected computer to load on some of the apps and register the device. The applications included are:\n1. CARTRIDGE: which accesses the content on a cartridge, which must be purchased separately\n2. PETPAD: allows you to customize the type, color, and features of a small electronic pet, who can then be fed, bathed, or used to learn how to draw upper- and lower-case letters.\n3. CAMERA: allows you to use the front- or rear-facing lenses to capture photos or videos of decent quality under ideal lighting conditions (decent enough to delight a young child, that is).\n4. MYSTUFF: a consolidated inventory of MyPhotos, MyArt, MyVideos, and MyStories, all of which are created in other apps.\n5. MYBOOKS: a bookshelf-style interface that links to eBooks which must be purchased separately\n6. MUSIC: a jukebox-style interface that includes one album with five songs about topics like punctuation, vowels, the alphabet, etc.\n7. SNEAKPEEKS: a link to various advertisements for add-on content including downloadable and cartridge-style eBooks, games, etc. (Some parents may feel annoyed to have a link to advertisements at all, but I appreciate that they've been confined to an app you must click on to launch. Thankfully, the ads are NOT displayed elsewhere on the device and do NOT intrude upon the functionality or appearance of other apps.)\n8. ARTSTUDIO: a simple but decently-featured drawing program much like the basic Paint program on most computers.\n9. CREATIVITY: allows you to make short 3-, 4-, or 5-section animated cartoons that include your own photos and voice if desired (this is the most complex app, but plenty accessible for children 4 and older, or with adult assistance).\n10. One FREE APP of your choosing from a list of three provided when you sync and register the device. The three options were a game, an eBook, or a video. I had assumed there would already be eBooks on the device, so I chose the free video (a 38-minute tour of the \"Letter Factory\" that teaches the sounds each letter of the alphabet makes). Had I known the MYBOOKS app would not include an eBook, I would've selected the eBook instead.\n\nCertainly, the LeapPad is a larger investment up front ($99) than many other similar kid-friendly electronics; however, I was pleased to find that the add-ons are lower in price that many competitors. For example, the add-ons for the FisherPrice iXL averaged $25 per title. Although each title included 6 features, the main lure was the eBook and the rest were mainly re-skinned options with very little added content for the built-in programs. That's exactly why we never bought any add-ons for the iXL. With the LeapPad, however, I was delighted to learn that you can buy an eBook alone for approximately $5 - $7.50. So we can buy our daughter three nice eBooks for the price of one add-on title for her FisherPrice iXL. There are also other apps, such as a story creator that allows you to use your own photos and voice to create your own stories, for $20 or less. Although the costs could add up quickly, keep in mind that for a young child like ours, you won't need to buy ANY additional content to keep him/her occupied for many dozens (probably hundreds) of hours. The included apps--especially the PETPAD, ARTSTUDIO, and CAMERA--will keep a lot of three year olds happy for a LONG time. Our daughter spent three hours just walking around the house snapping photos and giggling.\n\nFourth, the LeapPad interface is very child friendly. The physical buttons are minimalist and positioned well out of the way. They include a POWER button for turning the device on/off, an INCREASE and a DECREASE button for controlling the volume, a four-way NAVIGATION button (presumably for games or navigating menus, but we haven't had to use it at all yet), and a HOME button for returning to the main page. The buttons are sufficiently recessed or placed so that accidental button-presses are very rare. This is important because few things are more frustrating for a child than having their e-activity interrupted because they leaned on a button that returned them to the home screen, or some other such issue. Instead, most of the buttons they'll actually use are on-screen and controlled with the stylus. There are very few redundant buttons (some apps have a virtual home button, despite the device already having a physical button for that purpose) and many response options are standardized (to \"accept\" an option is always a green checkmark, and to \"reject\" or \"close\" an option is always a red X). This is good because it minimizes confusion related to the interface, and it also shows that Leap Frog has invested a lot of care and thought in the design of the apps. The LeapPad also has a built-in gyro to reorient the screen as you tilt/turn the device, as well as to play certain motion-sensitive games.\n\nFifth, the LeapPad has a very large (2.5\"W x 4.5\"L), bright, colorful screen. The one major shortcoming here is that it really isn't very suitable for use outdoors in bright sunlight, which washes it out so badly it can't really be used. If you're in shade or normal room-level brightness, however, it is very clear and colorful. Although it is not incredibly high resolution or high contrast, it is definitely crisp enough to provide a very pleasant user experience. Shapes, animations, and videos all render very clearly, without annoying jagged lines or pixelation. Watching the letter factory video we installed for free, there was a slightly muted color cast, much like streaming a video at mid-resolution on Netflix, but the animation was still very colorful and impressively smooth. I don't know if the slight lack of crispness was due to the limitations of the screen or the quality of the video file, but either way it did not detract from the viewing experience.\n\nSixth, the sound is quite good. Since the front-mounted speaker is aimed directly at the user, the lowest volume setting is still quite audible without being likely to annoy others nearby (It could be fairly described as \"airplane friendly\" even without the use of headphones!) At the highest volume level, it projects sound well enough to fill a small room, which is great if your child likes to turn on music for a \"dance party\" with friends or family. There are eight steps in the volume besides mute, so finding an appropriate sound level should not be a problem. One of my greatest complaints about children's electronic toys is usually the lack of sound control, but not so here. Well done Leap Frog!\n\nDOWNSIDES? There are few things to complain about here because, compared to other toys in the $99 range, I suspect this will be one of the best investments (in \"dollars per hour of enjoyment\") you can make, and it should prove modestly educational as well. However, here are the shortcomings most likely to annoy parents...\n\n1. No batteries or included charger. Right out of the box, you'll need four AA batteries. You can expect about 10 hours of use out of a set of batteries (my estimate based on actual use), which is certainly respectable; however, that will go quicker than you think if your child uses the device often. It would be nice if Leap Frog included rechargeable batteries and a charging cable, which would've made this a killer value. As it stands, you'll have to purchase those separately--and I definitely recommend doing so.\n\n2. No included eBooks. Given Leap Frog's reputation and marketing as an education-centered company, I really think the LeapPad ought to include one or two eBooks, which would further justify the $99 price tag, but also send a powerful message about the importance of reading (a message getting increasingly lost in our digital-tool obsessed society, which includes people likely to buy this kind of device). It's sad how many kids' parents don't read to them consistently, but Leap Frog could at least make sure those kids have one or two books that they can have this device read to them. I'm a college professor and I will tell you, hands down, there is no more cognitively beneficial experience in early childhood than to be read aloud to by, and to read with, parents (or some other guide) as often as possible.\n\n3. On-device advertisements. As I noted above, I respect Leap Frog for at least confining the included advertisements to an app that must be launched in order to view the ads. That is infinitely more preferable than having ads that intrude onto the rest of the user experience. So I'm fine with this, even though I know my daughter will watch the ads on her own and then ask me to purchase some of the add-ons. (If she asks for eBooks, I'll probably say yes.) Nonetheless, I mention it as a negative here because I know many parents will wish that no advertisements appeared anywhere on the device. They will also be frustrated to learn that a very few features (in particular, the \"treats\" and \"supplies\" for the virtual pet in the PETPAD app) are designed to run out so that you need to sync to the computer to replenish them. I suspect this allows Leap Frog to update the advertisements and to retrieve usage statistics about the device. Again, I realize this could be annoying, but I am grateful that it is not entirely mandatory. If you do NOT sync to a computer, the apps all remain usable, and about once every three days, some of the pet supplies will naturally reappear. However, if your daughter is dead set on having a strawberry to feed to her virtual dragon-dog-sheep pet, you should expect to be asked repeatedly until you sync to the computer to replenish the supplies sooner.  :)\n\n[4. Some add-ons, such as the Ultra-eBooks we've tried, are high in production value, but designed in a way that seriously detracts from their educational benefits. See my review of the \"Ultra eBook Learn to Read Collection: Fairy Tales\" for a detailed explanation that wouldn't fit here. --ADDED 10/29/2012.]\n\nAll in all, the LeapPad2 is an outstanding device for its intended niche. More affordable, more durable, and more child-friendly than more sophisticated Apple or Android tablets, considerably more responsive and enjoyable than competing kid tablets, and richly featured enough to provide a tremendous amount of entertainment and education for the cost.\n\nA final word of CAUTION: As someone who has taught college for over a decade and is extremely well read on the cultural and cognitive impact of digital technology, let me warn parents that, despite what they've undoubtedly been told by marketers and educators, it is NOT healthy to allow too frequent use of digital screen devices. Mountains of data show that frequent use of screen-equipped devices like the LeapPad (phones, iPods, computers, etc.) has a very detrimental impact on concentration, memory, precision of thought, patience, and other vital aspects of intellectual growth. In fact, the average teenager of the digital generation is likely to experience withdrawal-like symptoms (akin to substance abusers!) when denied access to some kind of screen for more than 20 minutes! Let your child enjoy the LeapPad, but do NOT let it become a replacement for a LOT of other, traditional developmentally-vital activities, including a LOT of traditional book reading, outdoor play, socialization events, engaging conversations with older peers (including parents), slow-paced board and strategy games, and even an occasional long, boring car ride on vacation. (Yes, I know screens are the easiest way to keep a child quiet and content on a long trip, but allowing them to get bored and be forced to entertain themselves in other, imaginative ways--without the quick fix of a screen to distract them--is immensely important to their cognitive development, especially their capacity to concentrate for prolonged periods, which is a vital ability for most successful people.) I don't mean to seem preachy at the end of my (very positive) review of the screen-equipped LeapPad2; however, an astonishing majority of parents are disturbingly uninformed about how detrimental constant, repeated exposure to digital screens can be. It's not that digital screens are evil; it's that they literally train the brain to follow shorter and shorter attention cycles, as well as to depend on lights, color, sounds, and other superficially stimulating cues. This needs to be offset with at least as many hours spent on quiet reading, which is still the only known way to effectively improve the brain's ability to recognize the subtle nuances of different arguments and perspectives, to develop one's own line of reasoning, to concentrate for an extended period of time, and other indispensable elements of advanced reasoning."}

We've had to limit her time with the LeapPad2 because otherwise she'd skip preschool and play on it from the time she got up in the morning until the time she went to bed.  My biggest complaint so far is the cost of the additional download content.  Looks like this is going to be the gift that keeps on costing us more money, but my daughter definitely loves it.\n\nA friend of mine also got their four year old daughter one of these a couple months ago, and it's already broken because she was hitting it too hard with the stylus.  Definitely supervise your child when using this and keep their stylus tapping under control."}

I have four children and they all want to play with it. Since I have bought it he has not put it down and he has learned his colors, shapes, letters and more. You can download apps just as you would on an Android or Tablet. Some parents maybe skeptical of paying that much for a device that age, I was at first, but it is the best thing as far as for learning I have bought yet. Very durable and easy to set up and use. You can track your childs learning by connecting it to your computer. If you have more than one child you can also track their skills as well. That is a great feature. It has a camera for fun play and drawing activities as well. I highly recommend this product to anyone."}

She can use it very easily, and has no problem figuring out where things are. It sees pretty durable. I did buy the get cover to help protect it if she drops it. People complain about the price but I think its reasonable, most electronic games or devices are not cheap so I expected this price.\n\n I would have given it 5 stars but my Main issue with this device it the batteries. WHY on earth would they put regular batteries in this? I need to put knew batteries in everyday. The rechargeable batteries don't last all day either. You can buy a ac adapter for the house and car, but my 3 year old is probably not going to sit in one spot. The adapter for the car is smart for long trips. I also have to say i was not super impressed with the app market. Some apps are $25.00 and I didn't think their was that great of a selection. I am sure the app center will improve though.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "I was pleasantly surprised when I received the Leap Pad 2 expecting to receive an Ultra Book for the Leap Pad.  My granddaughter's eyes lit up with excitement, and we opened up the box and went straight to work downloading the new apps, as well as all the other apps we previously purchased for the original Leap Pad.  Our Leap Pad came with batteries already installed, but after playing with it for only a very short while, the Leap Pad stopped working.  I thought it was strange because we never heard the warning sounds you normally hear when the batteries are running low, but I changed the batteries anyhow using brand new batteries out of the package.  No sooner had she turned it on, that she said, \"Gramma, the batteries don't work.\"  I knew this was impossible, so I opened up the battery compartment and found the problem -- the batteries don't fit tightly inside the compartment and \"pop\" out and apart from one another (so that they're no longer making contact with one another).  I was able to remedy this problem by placing a piece of tape across the batteries in order to hold them in place, but this is kind of a nuisance, and shouldn't be (and it's still not fool-proof, as they came loose several more times).  I see that there is a rechargeable battery and charger available for the Leap Pad 2, so I will likely buy this & hopefully, this will fix the problem.  Ironically, I always thought the battery compartment of the original Leap Pad was too tight (I sometimes struggled to remove the batteries when they need to be replaced), and it seems like they tried to fix this problem by removing the little plastic piece that sat between the batteries, only it took it to the other extreme, and now they're too loose & don't fit in there tight enough.\n\nOther than the battery issue, we are loving the Leap Pad 2.  We own several other Leap Frog products, including the Tagg Reader Pen, Leapster2, Leapster Explorer, the original Leap Pad and now the Leap Pad2.  It amazes me how Leap Frog keeps up with the times and keeps updating it's toys so that they remain desirable to pre-schoolers.  I purchased the Leap Pad for my granddaughter last year for Xmas after I purchased an iPad for myself.  She was so excited that she had an \"iPad for kids\"!  She would spend hours playing the various games, taking care of her pet, reading along with Cinderella or Tinkerbell, listening to music or creating art work from the pictures that she took with the onboard camera.\n\nWith the Leap Pad 2, she is still able to do all of these things, plus so much more.  An additional camera has been added so kids can now take pics without having to turn the Pad around, having to take a pic without seeing the image on the screen (and unlike an iPad or iPhone, or other android device, the front & rear facing cameras on the Leap Pad take pics of the same quality).  The internal storage has been doubled (a good thing as the last time we purchased an App, we had to delete something else in order to make room). The image and video quality is somewhat improved, and the reaction time/speed of use has been increased, so kids aren't twiddling their fingers waiting for their games to load.  The Leap Pad 2 does feel a little heavier than the original Leap Pad, which I guess is due to the larger storage capacity and additional camera.  This could pose a problem for smaller children, but overall, I find the unit to be more solid and durable.\n\nThe Leap Pad only comes with one stylus, whereas the original came with a spare.  Granted, we never used the spare, and maybe this is why it was discontinued on the LP2 (at least we still have a spare, in case we ever need one).  One of the things I love most about the Leap Frog family of video games is that they are \"backwards compatible\" meaning, all the games and apps I purchased for the Leap Pad also work on the Leap Pad 2.  In fact, nearly all the game cartridges we purchased for the Leapster Explorer also work with the Leap Pad (1 & 2), so we're definitely getting our money's worth of gaming/learning fun.\n\nOverall, I think the Leap Pad2 is another winner and a product I will highly recommend to other parents/grandparents.  With all the iPads and Kindles and Nooks and Android phones and tablets, it's nice for kids to have a tablet of their own that provides age-specific activities, well made and durable so that parents can allow their kids to play with it freely without fear of breaking or ruining.  I'm looking forward to the next idea and release from Leap Pad (and hopefully the battery compartment on THAT device will be perfect -- not too tight, not too loose, but just right! I would have given the Leap Pad 5 five stars across the board if it hadn't been for the battery issue.  I'm still hoping the rechargeable batteries might fit in there tighter than the disposable ones)"}

I gave it to her though about a week after I got it, as it is electronic and only has a short window for return to Amazon if something ia amiss with it. I also purchased Pet Pals 2, Dora and Mr. Pencil. She played only with the Pet pals. She is only 3 and 10 months so I figure she will try the others later. However, after a few days of playing Pet Pals it started to freeze up and we had to keep turning it off and back on. This of course frustrated her and it also kills the batteries as the child keeps trying to make it work before it hits you that it has froze. I sent the game back to Amazon and they replaced it the next day. I will give it to her the replacement game today and if it keeps freezing then there is a possibility it may be the system and that is what I am waiting to see. Also be aware that the recharger does not come with the bundle though a very nice case does. The case has a place for storing several games. The recharger is approximately 37.00 on Amazon and free shipping with prime. I will update if the new game does the same thing. Hope this helps."}

You can not use any other games or educational software except their own, very expensive and inflatedly priced software.\n\n2. Even if you pay their sky high prices and buy them, they can only be used on one device - with great difficulty and pain may be you will be able to use on one more device, that's it. You can not even share these within your family. If you have three kids, you have to purchase each software TWICE!\n\n3. You can not use it to play any of your videos, photos, MP3 files or any multimedia content other than what they sell you, again at a highly inflated price even for an ordinary video clip that you can watch on your TV or computer. What good is such a toy if it can not even play your MP3 songs and video clips? Or display your kids photos?\n\n4. To have few variety of games and the educational software to be of any real use, you will have to spend close to $500 at least.\n\n5. There are no built-in rechargeable batteries, not even a charger or adapter. The batteries will be drained out in less than two hours of use and it is a real pain to remove them from the device and replace new ones assuming you have them ready.\n\n6. The processor is too slow to respond to your basic stylus moves or clicks and very annoying that even basic figures and letters are so difficult to draw.\n\n7. The built-in cameras are worthless, poor quality, without proper lighting it will only capture dark images. It is just a cheap kid's toy and nothing else.\n\n8. If you are not computer skilled forget this toy. You will be very frustrated to get it to work or download the Apps online.\n\n9. You will be annoyed to know that they purposefully let your Pets supply vanish in just few uses and then force you to use their Connect software so as to display you all their Ads to forcefully sell you all those junk games costing $25 a piece...Horrendous.\n\n10. Quite often you get many misleading e-mails saying there are 15% or some thing discount sales ending in few days...but if you try to purchase them online, you will be disappointed to know that those don't apply to your LeapPad Apps.\n\n11. You can not expand the system in any way. Can not use any external memory cards etc. For all use you have to connect your PC and your device can only be controlled by their software. You have no control of any thing on the toy as it is just NOT your's but THEIR's."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "Before getting serious about the LeapFrog Tablet for your child, consider the following: We are at \"mass saturation\" point in terms of a seemingly endless supply of digital tablets for a finite number of consumers who can afford them.  Afford them or not, consumers have managed to obtain at least one portable digital device and, assuming they're not expending excessive time comparing their tablet with all of the others, they're enjoying the apps, games, social networking, picture and video taking, movie-watching, music collecting and listening that their tablet is capable to putting in their laps.  But soon the novelty wears off.  The tablet (or iPod) begins to refuse to download more apps, or even to update those apps already on the tablet: storage space has simply been maxed out.  Moreover, the novelty of many apps failing to deliver on their claims leads to tablet-owners who are both \"jaded\" by their apps yet constantly seeking \"new\" apps, which prove equally disposable.\n\nThe foregoing is not a scenario that a responsible parent might wish be played out in the hands and before the eyes and ears of any child below the age of twelve.  Bottom line: If your youngster is not already jaded by his or her personal iPod, iPhone, or iPad, then the LeapFrog LeapPad is not only a \"toy\" that will entrance and entertain but it's a rare opportunity to introduce the child to a wondrous world of learning--one in which time-wasting \"surfing\" of the internet are simply \"off limits\" by virtue of the the self-contained rules of this educational toy.\n\nThe LeapPad2 had eliminated some of the potentially frustrating limitations of the LeapPad2, making it all the more enticing to the child who is not too (sophisticated, spoiled, jaded, fill in the blank) to take notice of the device's internet restriction."}

She was able to quickly understand how to use the Leap Pad 2.\n\nLeap Pad 2 new features are: a  higher resolution front and back camera, more memory space, faster processor, improved battery life, two new in-built in games, and rechargeable battery pack option.\n\nThose upgrades make a difference. I wasn't sure what the old Leap Pad so I checked out the first Leap Pad at the store, to give me the feel of how the old Leap Pad functioned. The new The LeapPad2 feels much better, faster response, when turning  it on or changing between pages to browse through the apps.\n\nThe two new apps: Cartoon Director and Art Studio are an awesome addition to the other regular apps from the first Leap Pad. Cartoon Director allows you to snap photo of a friend or family member and then put their head directly into a story before recording their own voiceover.\n\nWhat  I Love about LeapPad2: It's durability. The quality of the leaPad2 is strong and has passes the clumsiness of my little one. She has dropped the LeapPad twice now and seem it will last a long time. Another awesome feature would be the rechargeable battery option.\n\nOverall, the quality & price  is reasonable. The Leap Pad 2 is perfect for the little ones to learn and entertainment."}

I love how the LeapPad2 allows him independence, and encourages success. The voice on the LeapPad2 helps kids figure out what to do. The LeapPad2 has held up well to drops and basic \"kid\" handling. I love how versatile the LeapPad2 is. If you have kids varying in ages or want a toy your child won't outgrow quickly this is the toy for you.\n\nMy son really enjoys tracing the letters. It is a difficult task, but the really enjoys when he has traced the letter three times and they spell a word. Example: Write C. Spell Clap. Dog claps.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "I pre-ordered 2 LeapPad2 tablets for my toddler twins. We waited happily in anticipation of their birthday presents to arrive. But only one of the five apps downloaded correctly, the rest did not and I repeatedly tried downloading from different computers and even followed their instructions to do a hard factory reset (which meant that I lost all of the credits and customizations that my kids had put on them).  I removed all Kaspersky firewalls and followed instructions to the letter. Nothing has worked. Some apps work on one LeapPad and not the other. I am saddened and ashamed for LeapFrog to have shipped a product that is not 100% excellent - we have been loyal customers for 10+ years.  They should have done more research and testing.  Perhaps they will release a software patch to fix this (I noticed another comment about the apps as well).\n\nIt would be an excellent product if it worked correctly.  I can see that my kids love it, but it's just not working.\n\nI have never written a review on ANY product on Amazon, but I had to write this one.  It's a sad day."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "If your child is always begging to use your phone or tablet but you're worried about them breaking it or accessing things they shouldn't, you NEED the LeapPad2. The design is kid-friendly and has been put to the test by my three year old who has dropped it twice from our high bed onto our wood floor & it suffered NO damage. {Plus, even if it DID break- you're out $100, not $700.}\n\nMy son didn't have the original LeapPad so I can't compare it to the previous version, but I do know that this has some new features the other one didn't, like the camera on the front {which my son loves because he is a total ham & loves taking pictures of himself} and the memory size which is TWICE as big at 4GB. It can also be used with a recharger {sold separately} which we're looking to invest in because while the batteries haven't gone out yet on ours, my son uses it quite frequently and we know we'll be buying lots of batteries if we don't get it.\n\nI love that there are SO many games, books, and apps available for the LeapPad2- you can use any digital app or game cartridge from the entire LeapPad & LeapFrog Explorer selection. By the end of this year, that will be over 325 options- my kid will definitely never get bored!\n\nPlaying games or reading books on the LeapPad is easy & fun. The games don't lag, the graphics are phenomenal for a kid's product {even better than many iPhone apps we have!} and of course feature characters that my son loves. Since the LeapPad is for ages 3-9, the selection includes simpler options for the three year olds like my son & more complicated games for older kids. The games even automatically adjust themselves to accommodate your child's current level. I love that this product will grow with my son & that he could very well use it for the next 6 years and still learn from it the entire time.\n\nWhether you're looking for the perfect gift, a toy, or an educational tool, you'll find it in the LeapPad2!\n\nPlease Note: I received the LeapPad2 from LeapFrog in order to share my thoughts on the product. All opinions are 100% authentic & not swayed by receiving the product."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "I really like this toy.  My kids used to play with their dad's ipad constantly and it was hard for my husband to ever get to use it for himself!  Now that we have this, they fight over it, ha!  It is very good for kids and has some great stuff that is included and I like that each child can have their own login with a picture assigned.\n\nThe recommended age for this toy is 3-9 but let's face it, if you have younger kids at home, they will want to try playing with it.  And it was a little too hard for my 2 year old, who is pretty smart.  That being said, the games are great because they encourage practice!  There is one writing game where the kids trace the letters with the stylus and it is VERY picky about preciseness.  That is what frustrates my kids!  But they now can actually write letters with a pen and paper.  All of the Leapfrog stuff has been amazing for teaching my kids their letters, sounds, and numbers.\n\nI wish the Leappad came with a charger, like a phone does.  Instead it just comes with standard AA batteries which die rather quickly.  You can buy the additional charger pack which I would recommend or you can buy your own rechargeable batteries."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "Last year my boys got the LeapPad and ever since they have barely let it out of their hands.\n\nSome of my favorite features of the original LeapPad:\n\nGames compatible with Leapster Explorer and LeapPad (we have both so its nice not to buy different games)\nAbility to download games through an App store at reasonable prices\nBuilt-in Camera and video recorder\nGood size for kids to play and hold in their hands\nStylus included and can be attached with string\n\nThe new LeapPad 2 has all the above features and then some!\n\nMain differences between LeapPad 2 and LeapPad:\n\nCamera in Front and Back of LeapPad 2 (only 1 camera on back of LeapPad)\nBigger Memory Size (4 GB compared to 2 GB)\nRecharger available\nUp to 9 hrs. of battery life (compared to only up to 8 hrs.)\nBigger Processor (550 Mhz vs. 393 Mhz.)\n\nSince we have both I can compare them enough to say the new LeapPad is pretty sweet!  While I wouldn't replace your current LeapPad if it works just fine, the new LeapPad is definitely something to think about if you don't own one.  The changes are somewhat small but the two cameras is what does it for us.  My sons love taking pictures of themselves and it is much easier to take them with a front camera.  The memory size I am sure will come in handy too because we were getting to the point that we downloaded so many apps (average price $5) that we had to pick and choose what went on the device.  Not all of our apps fit on our old LeapPad so it is nice to fill up our new LeapPad 2 with some room to spare.  A quick thing on the apps too is that there is a good variety available including videos, games, ebooks and even some full cartridge games.  There is actually over a 100+ of cartridges and apps available to check out.\n\nI think LeapFrog has finally listened to parents too by making devices that use old games so you don't have to buy new games constantly.  Now don't get me wrong, there are new games out like \"Brave\" and \"Phineas & Ferb\" though to keep kids excited.  The processor is something I didn't necessarily notice the speed of, though that could be because my boys don't let me on it long enough to notice!\n\nOverall, we love the LeapPad 2.  It has everything I'd want in a tablet for my preschooler and it will grow with my child.  The recommend ages are 3-9 years old and my sons are 4 and 5, with no inkling that they are letting it go.  Now I will say I have a friend who her son thought it was too babyish compared to the Nintendo DS his older siblings had, but while it may seem babyish it is more than appropriate for kids.  The games and books grow with your child and become more challenging as they continue on.  The games are in-line with their ages and you don't have to worry about in-appropriate content or them doing something you don't want them to.  Oh and once you hook up the LeapPad 2 to the computer you can check your child's play and learning progress, redeem rewards (print certificates or downloads), and create a personalized learning experience by customizing their name and favorites."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "The LeapPad 2 is a great educational toy for my three year old! However, there are only a few games recommended for that age. Our toddler enjoys them and is able to play some of the more difficult games as well.  I highly recommend getting the rechargeable battery pack as the LeapPad 2 could use a lot of batteries.\n\nLeapFrog has EXCELLENT customer service!  Our daughter shattered the screen after she'd only had the toy for a few months.  I contacted LeapFrog, and although it wasn't the type of damage covered under warranty they kindly replaced her LeapPad 2.  I would consider LeapFrog superior to the competition because the company stands behind their product."}

It's our go-to for rainy days, doctors waiting rooms, and when mama needs to get some stuff done! He loves the videos, especially the Sesame Street app. I've been amazed at how much he engages with the different apps. Some of our favorites are the Pet Pad and the Learning Songs on their music app. He LOVES it! It's completely durable which is a nice break for my iphone. Plus, unlike others, the apps aren't terrible for the parents to overhear!\nI think it would work for younger than 3 and older than 5. It has a great range of activities that could work for a wide range of ages and I've even caught myself participating in some of the games with my son!!\n\nAll in all, I think this is an incredible tablet for a child, very reasonably priced for what you are getting, and very educational! This mama highly recommends it."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "LeapFrog sent their new LeapFrog LeapPad2 Explorer for my family to review. We checked out some of the differences between this device and the original LeapPad and tested its functions and apps. If you are wondering whether to get a LeapPad2, just let your kids use your iPad, or skip tablets for kids altogether, here's our take:\n\nMy educational philosophy is that outdoor activity and play is key for very young children. Despite being high-tech in my professional life, the early childhood teaching techniques I advocate are decidedly Pre-Industrial. Yet there are places where a thoughtful use of technology can enhance learning.\n\nInitial studies show that using a tablet can boost literacy scores in Kindergarteners and help children on the Autism spectrum improve their communication skills. The idea that tablets can help reluctant learners or provide a reliable and safe learning interaction for children makes a lot of sense.\n\nWhat doesn't make sense to a lot of families, however, is handing a $400 device over to a young child, even with a super-rugged cover. Also problematic is sharing a device the adults need for work and communication with a kid who is just beginning to grasp the concept of taking turns. Another concern is an Internet connection that lets your kids veg out on the entertainment equivalent of junkfood, see inappropriate content, or \"accidentally\" rack up bills buying game points or new apps.\n\nThe LeapFrog LeapPad2 Explorer restores parental control to the equation. To download apps, the LeapPad must be connected to the computer. All the apps and games are created by LeapFrog, a company that is practically synonymous with educational tech toys. And the LeapPad 2 is even more durable than its predecessor so your three year old can hog it without you worrying about getting it back destroyed...or not at all.\n\nHere's what you get with the LeapPad 2. I've highlighted the main differences between the original LeapFrog LeapPad and the LeapPad 2:\n\n * LeapPad2 Explorer Learning Tablet (4GB Memory, double the original)\n * 2 Built-in Cameras & Video Recorders (the LeapPad 2 has a front and back camera; the original has only one camera in back)\n * Extended battery life (about 1 additional hour)\n * Faster processor (550 MHz, compared to 393 MHz on the original)\n * LeapFrog Learning Songs App (5 Songs Included)\n * Pet Pad Writing App\n * Cartoon Creativity App\n * Art Studio App\n * Free App Download\n * USB Cable\n\nThere is also a recharger available separately for purchase, a welcome change to the original since these devices are total battery drainers.\n\nJust about the only drawback to the LeapPad 2 is the cost of cartridges and apps. To someone of my generation, this is not a deal-breaker. Younger parents, used to cheap and free apps on smart phones, might balk, however, at the recurring cost of purchasing additional games. Plus, the cartridges can be traded or resold.\n\nThe games available on the LeapPad is what truly distinguishes it from the pack, however. Although there are definitely winners out there, a lot of free and cheap apps for smart phones and adult tablets are hastily thrown together and provide little educational value.  With LeapFrog, parents know they are getting appropriate and pedagogically correct content for their kids.\n\nPlus, some of the games \"auto-level\", adjusting the difficulty to challenge each child. A few games even allow parents to customize the device with math sets and spelling lists from school.\n\nAs with adult tablets, kids can play LeapPad games using the stylus, the touch screen, and the built-in motion sensor.\n\nKids' interests are often character-driven and so my daughter's favorite is the LeapFrog LeapPad Ultra eBook Adventure Builder: Disney Fairies: Tink's Midnight Tea Party: in this game, she can read the story at three different levels, make choices that affect the story, and play games. There are different modes (read the book to me, read the page to me, and read it myself). You can also record yourself reading the book, a great option for parents and grandparents who live far away.\n\nThe ever popular Pet Pad app comes with the LeapPad and allows kids to practice writing while playing with their virtual pet.\n\nMy kids are also big fans of the Disney Pixar Brave Cartridge, a first-person adventure game in which the player moves Merida to solve science puzzles. The variety of different science activities (learning about life cycles, experimenting with physics) is very engaging.\n\nMy personal favorite is the LeapPad Creativity App: Disney Animation Artist: Mickey and Friends. I really enjoy trying to draw Mickey and his buddies with the stylus and think this is a great game for future artists and Disney fans of all ages.\n\nThe addition of Little Pim language videos is the start of a beautiful relationship and I am hoping the two companies will develop some interactive language learning content.\n\nThe bottom line is that you will get an excellent learning tool with plenty of high quality content if you are willing to invest in apps and cartridges.\n\nAs stated above, we received this tablet from LeapFrog for review. All opinions are my own."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "We limit the time our kiddos spend watching TV, and I've steered clear of computer games and gaming systems. Knowing that the LeapPad2 offers children the opportunity to learn through play made me feel comfortable enough to let the girls test it out.\n\nI love that the tablet isn't filled with mindless games. Sure, there are games for the kids, but they are learning games designed to help your little ones grow their skills in math, reading, science, social studies, logic, and more. And they are fun! You can track a child's progress online, to see where they excel and where they are being challenged. This is helpful in showing me what I can work on with them.\n\nMy girls didn't mention it, but I was impressed with the quality of audio and animation with the games, eBooks, and videos. The sound is clear (and adjustable!), and the images are crisp.\n\nThere are SO many different games, books, and activities to keep them busy. If I didn't limit their \"electronics time\" they'd want to play all day. ;) With their online library, LeapPad will have over 325 games, apps, music, videos, and more by the end of the year. I also like that you can purchase an AC adapter and car charger to save on batteries!\n\nTwo thumbs up for the LeapPad2. My kids are sold.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "Last summer when the original LeapPad came out, my then 3-yr. old was stoked to get one of his very own. However, since we'd just shelled out the dough for a MobiGo and several of the games just months earlier, we couldn't really justify it.\n\nThat is until the MobiGo started shorting out. At first, it was just every one in awhile...but then it started becoming a real problem. It got to the point where my son couldn't go more than 5 minutes without the device freezing up and needing to be rebooted. Something not easily reasoned to a kid deep in throes of his game. That's when we decided enough was enough. We heard rumors of a LeapPad2 coming out, so we elected to wait it out, and take the plunge when it did.\n\nBut then, before we had a chance to do so, I was contacted by LeapFrog, as part of a select group of bloggers, to test out this product. And I have to say, it's really lived up to the hype. It's everything, if not more, that I expected it to be.\n\nHere are some things I love about it:\n\n  Super easy-to-use interface (my son has absolutely no problem navigating his way around)\n  The surprisingly good quality of the 2-way/video camera (we have a kid camera, and the quality of this is far, far superior)\n  The eBook app (with this reading app included on the device, there's no need to purchase a separate reading system)\n  The durability of the product itself (my son has dropped it several times, but by looking at it, you'd never know it - not a dent or scratch to speak of!)\n  The endless amount of educational apps available at your fingertips (something I've found to be scarce in the 3+ yr. old age range on the iPad)\n\nThere have been zero issues with it shorting out/unexpectedly turning off, so for this alone, it's rated better than the MobiGo in my book. To be honest, though, you really can't even compare the two. The LeapPad2 is like the Bentley of electronic learning systems. Everything about this item is light years ahead of it's competitors (i.e. MobiGo, Vtech InnoTab, Fisher Price iXL, Leapster, etc.). Yes, it's a little more pricey, but for just $30-40 more? I'd definitely say it's worth the investment.\n\nThe one and only thing I don't absolutely love about this product is how quickly it eats batteries. We seriously went through 4 AA batteries within a 3-day time span! Granted this was also a problem with the MobiGo, I was hoping it'd not be an issue with the LeapPad2. However, since it is (as is probably the case with any high performance gaming device), I recommend purchasing either the recharger pack (which we did) or a couple sets of rechargeable batteries.\n\nBesides this minor flaw, I consider this product to be pretty BA! If I let him, my son would play on his LP2 morning, noon and night (which I totally don't, btw)! If you're in the market for a learning tablet, there really is no better product!\n\nDisclosure: I was sent this product to review free of charge, but all opinions are 100% my own."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "This is a nice fun toy for kids with many educational games. But LeapPad tablets predates to non tablet times when tablets were either too new or too expensive. Nowadys you can buy an android based tablet for $199 like rugged Kindle Fire, powerful Google Nexus or Samsung Galaxy (with front and back camera). You can not only customize these tablet with hundreds of kids games, reading material and education application for a fraction of the cost of LeapFrog apps. At the rate kids get bored with same games you would have spent way over 200 pretty quick not to mention battery expenses of leap pad. Androip tablets give you all the gaming power and much more at relatively similar cost up front and end up cheaper in the long run. Most android tablets are rechargeable and their memory is exapndable and kids can watch streaming movie since they are wifi and bluetooth capable."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "LeapFrog has a knack for combining what I love about toys (developmentally appropriate, educational, fun) and what my son loves about toys (fun, interactive, has noise, has lights haha!).\n\nThey sent me the new LeapPad2 to review, and we've been playing with it for about a week. Since I have a newborn who naps 4 times a day, Samuel gets \"LeapPad\" time when I'm putting her down for a nap. This is a win-win because he gets to play with his favorite toy, and I don't have a 2 year old running into the nursery saying, \"Moooooooommmmyyyy!!!\" at the top of his lungs.\n\nYou can read the details below, but here's my review in a nutshell: This thing is so great, I want one for ME.\n\nWhy I love the LeapPad2 (there's so much I could say here, these are the highlights):\n\n- There is no Internet access. My son loves to play games on an old iPhone we have, or, of course, our own phones, but he knows exactly how to get to YouTube, and there's just too much Internet access for him to play on these phones independently. Some parents might think it's a pain to connect online to look for and download apps, but I see that as a plus.\n\n- Developmentally appropriate! My son is only 2 and a half years old, and the device is made for ages 3-9, but he still has no problem finding a ton of fun, and I can see how he will be able to use the LeadPad2 for years. Literally. Here's a really cool tidbit: The eBooks and games actually adapt to your child. As he answers more questions correctly, for example, he gets harder questions - I LOVE THIS FEATURE. I can say so much more about the kid-ness of the LeapPad2 - how it's perfect for their size, how friendly voices and images show them how to play each app so they're not lost - LeapFrog knows kids. That's all there is to it.\n\n- No boredom. Not only does the LeapPad2 arrive with great content, but there are over 300 apps available, plus any LeapFrog Explorer games can be used in the device. It's just not possible for this to get old.\n\n- Variety includes creative learning. Developing children's creativity is absolutely lacking for the current education regime. We are so focused on math, science, reading, and writing that we won't let our kids color an elephant purple. We've played with apps that help a child learn to draw (like really draw not just scribble or doodle or color) and create a film. I was quite impressed with the creative apps.\n\n- At a retail of $99, the value is really high for the price. I know people who have purchased iPads for their kids, which is totally their choice, but for a young child $99 is much easier to stomach for a super nice Christmas or birthday present.\n\nWhat could be improved:\n\n- My son is left-handed. I was a little disappointed when I saw the stylus on the right side of the device. Thankfully, the screen is responsive to fingers, so he doesn't need to use the stylus unless he's working on writing games. For example, the Pet Pad has a writing section where he can trace letters with the stylus. I was pleased to see that there is a left-handed mode for this that flips the screen around, but the child has to 1) know they're left-handed 2) see this small button and know what it's for 3) press it every time they enter this zone. The device could be more left-hand friendly by assigning the child's writing hand to their profile and using that setting in all writing activities.\n\n- The LeapPad2 runs on 4 AA batteries. You can use rechargeable AA batteries, and you can also buy a recharger kit for the device. And you will want to have a way to charge rather than buy batteries. I think we got maybe 7-10 hours of playtime on one set of batteries. It would be a huge parental-approval boost to have the recharger kit come with the LeapPad2, straight off the shelf.\n\nI hope this review is truly helpful to you! It was just released, and I think they are sold out on Amazon and people might be reselling them at a higher price. If I were you, I'd wait until the rush dies down and get one straight from the manufacturer.\n\nDisclosure: LeapFrog provided the LeapPad2 for this review, but all opinions are mine all mine!"}

A few months ago we received the original LeapPad and my three younger kids were beyond impressed (ages 8, 2.5 and 2.5). My 8 year old enjoyed the video game aspect with fun characters and my little ones loved the videos and feeding the pet, and mostly were glad to have something similar to mom's iPad!\n\nI was given the opportunity to review the new LeapPad2 and was excited to see what new features would be added.\n\nOne of the best new features is the fact that there are two cameras. The camera on the back of the LeapPad2 is great for taking photos and videos of others. The front camera is perfect for kids to take photos of themselves! (the ease of use for the cameras is great for my 2 year old twins!).\n\nThe LeapPad2 loads faster than its predecessor, and has more storage space for games and apps.  There are enough games available both on store shelves and the app store to keep a child busy for years!\n\nMy 10 year old even decided to try the LeapPad2 out, convinced that it was a baby toy and that he would hate it. Hours later I saw him still sitting and editing  photos and creating cartoons on the (included) cartoon creator.\n\nI am an avid eBook reader, so I love to see the interactive eBooks that can grow with my kids, with options to read to them, read one page at a time, or allow them to read to themselves (or a younger sibling).\n\nThe battery life is longer than the LeapPad2, but it is still a battery hog, so rechargeable batteries are a must. LeapFrog has also developed a rechargeable battery pack (sold separately) that I will be investing in, so that we do not have to be removing and replacing batteries so often. ( car charger option would be nice as well, for travel).\n\nBottom line: I wholeheartedly recommend this product for parents of kids of all ages, it truly will grow with my youngest kids and will be enjoyed by my older kids!\n\nDisclosure: I was sent this product free of charge to review, however, as always, all opinions are 100% my own."}

I saw the announcement for the leappad2 and thought this might be a way to make up for my mistake.  We preordered from Amazon, and it arrived today.  If you have the original leappad, here are some differences that I noticed:\n\n* I couldn't open the box without tearing/cutting it.  Leapfrog seems to have glued down every flap.  I was hoping to open it, download the apps, configure it, and repackage it so i could wrap it up as a present.  But that wasn't possible without damaging the box.\n\n* It is definitely faster/snappier.  The upgraded CPU is a noticeable improvement.\n\n* The battery covers are significantly improved.  With the old one, you could use the stylus to pop off the covers.  The new ones snap firmly into place.  There's no way my daughter will be able to remove these...\n\n* Just like the original, you get to pick one app.  But I'm pretty sure the app selection has changed.  The choices now are roly poly picnic, hamster music, a leapfrog video, or an ebook.\n\n* Unlike the original leappad, The package only comes with one stylus, which is already connected to the leappad with the included string.\n\n* Leapfrog appears to have added a new connector for the stylus string below the stylus slot.  This should help children who are lefties. (like my daughter)\n\nThat's all I can think of for now.  I'll update this review as my daughter plays with it.  I am certain she is going to love the front camera.\n\nPS - I am just an average person that actually paid for this.  I'm not some professional mommy-blogger that got a free 'sample' in exchange for writing a glowing review.  All of these reviews that predate 8/1/2012 seem a little contrived, don't you think?\n\nEDIT #1 (8/3/2012) - Within the leappad connect app, I could install all apps that I PURCHASED for our original leappad on to the new one.  It would not allow me to install the free, selectable app that came with the purchase of the original leappad.\n\nEDIT #2 (8/5/2012) - If you search the internet you can find two codes for two free apps, \"Alphabet Soup\", and \"The Book of Super Awesome Stuff.\"  I had previously downloaded these apps to our first (lost) leappad.  Leappad Connect would not allow me to install these on the new Leappad 2.  Not sure why.  I am going to open a support ticket with Leap Frog.  I've already had an open ticket regarding the lost leappad, so this might be related to that.  I guess what I'm saying is that this might not be a problem for others...\n\nEDIT #3 (8/8/2012) - One of my daughter's favorite apps is the Music app.  There are 5 songs that are preloaded.  She plays them all the time.  She loves music, so I can't wait for the official MP3 upgrade thats supposed to come out this fall.  I hope Leapfrog will not overcharge for it...\n\nSpeaking of overcharging...  I was in Target the other day and was surprised to see two \"Recharger Packs\" for the Leappad 2 on sale.  They were $40 each.  $40!!!  Come on Leapfrog!  $30 is at the high-end of what I will pay for a battery.  Replacement laptop batteries are cheaper than this.  They should be more like $20.  It's antics like this that will drive loyal customers to the flood of cheap android devices that will be coming in the next several months...\n\nEDIT #4 (8/17/2012) - This is my last edit. My daughter LOVES the new creativity app.  Basically it lets you create animated stories.  You get to pick the background, props, and characters.  From there you can add movement and action, and a dialog.  You can use the camera to replace the face of the characters with a photo.  I was impressed.  I've also seen that many of the apps are lefty friendly, meaning it will allow you to turn the leappad over so the string isn't stretched when using the left hand.  I'm happy with the purchase, and my daughter is happy too.\n\nI have little doubt these will be a hot item this Christmas.  If you are thinking you want to get this for your child, don't wait.  Otherwise the scalpers will be your only option.  (That, or waiting until after Christmas."}

My daughter is almost 8 and my son is 11. I knew my son wouldn't be interested in the Leap Pad 2(and it's not designed for kids his age), and I was wondering if it might be too young for my daughter. (It was perfect!) My son recently bought a Kindle and my hubby recently bought a Nook.  My daughter had been feeling a bit jealous and wasn't quite ready for the Kindle or Nook, so this was perfect timing for us.  It arrived in the mail and right away my daughter was thrilled!\n\nAs a teacher, I give this product an A+++!  I absolute LOVE the ultra e-books that can be purchased.  I cannot say that enough.  I LOVE them!  It is an absolutely brilliant product.  You are able to decide between 3 different reading levels (the same story, just different levels of text) and decide how much support you'd like.  It can read to you, or you can be the reader (just pointing to words you need help with).\n\nIn the classroom, we do something called Daily 5.  One of the 5 things kids need to do each day is listen to reading.  It's important to have a good model for kids to hear.  It promotes fluency in reading.  Listening to a story on the Leap Pad 2 is a great way to do this.  Kids also need to read to themselves in Daily 5.  That's really hard to provide support when the adult is busy (whether it's a parent or a teacher).  With the ultra e-book, kids have the support they need.  It's so cool!\n\nNow, back to my daughter.  She has spent hours using this.  She loves the art studio, e-books that I have purchased, camera, and video camera.  She even figured out how to write her own story, using pictures which are preloaded on the Leap Pad, incorporate an audio recording, and also add her own photos.  I'm loving the learning that is happening!!!\n\nOverall, we love having this product.  I would strongly suggest the AC adaptor or charger to go along with this.  We have gone through 16 AA batteries in about a week.  Whew!  That could get expensive.  I will be buying the charger!  I would also suggest a carrying case, because it will be going everywhere with you.  One last thing I love... I can finally have my iPhone back!"}

Her birthday is next week. Today they all went out of stock. I Called most of the Toys R US in my area and they din't have them. Now I know why, people are buying them and selling them for a lot more than they are worth. I understand that some of them are trying to make a profit..but one seller have one listed for over $260..WOW..REALLY!!! Do you think people are that dumb or desperate. People all I have to say is save your money and wait. They will be back in stock soon. C'one with the economy as bad as it is, you have people everywhere trying to make a quick buck at our expense ..and our kids are not gonna die if they don't get it now. Like you, I'm eagered to get one for my daughter, but it' not that serious. The innotab which does the same thing will be released on the 7th, if anything, she can get that. Show the greedy sellers not to make fools out of us. I'm very disappointed in AMAZON for allowing this. THIS IS PURE GREED!!!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "We have had the Leap Pad 2 for about a week now, and my 18 month old daughter is obsessed! For us, this is a great alternative to handing her our iPhone (something she wishes we would do, but we're firm on that one!). She loves the interaction, the ability to draw, and especially the videos. As a mommy, I love that the videos are not only educational, but highly interactive and hold her attention for a while. Additionally, I love that this is a toy that will grow with my daughter - we can continue to invest in games and videos that are age appropriate and educational. I've long been a fan of LeapFrog products, but this one is by far my favorite!"}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "Indicative to our countries distress, Leapad brings wall street to our children. The price of this unit is $100 in stores but because it's hard to find the price has jumped to 100% to $150. If I were the CEO of this company I would have RESPECT for my customers and I wouldn't dare hold them to a wall by their throats like this. This kind of business practice is the problem with this country. We shouldn't stand for this kind of unethical gouging. A company that is being overwhelmed by sales volume from a popular product like the Leapad 2 may jack up prices to reduce demand to a manageable level. However, most price hikes are done in stages on the theory that customers will be accustomed to higher prices over time and be willing to tolerate them as they become more loyal. This kind of unethical gouging not only makes us go elsewhere, it makes us angry at your company. If you are out of stock or getting low, treat us how you would want to be treated. Honest and fairly. Have you so quickly forgotten the golden rule? Wit these games we ask our children to respect the golden rule and to share and to be honest and fair yet when we become adults we sell the golden rule to them with an inflated amazon price.\n\nI do own this product, here's my review of the leappad2's functionality. It is a well built durable machine with a quick response from the processor, low res display and pretty lackluster development from the software end though. I am really surprised because my 2 year old isn't old enough to use the D-Pad and my 4 year old finds the games boring and too easy. Maybe if I had a 3 year old this product would be useful to me?? There are no free apps so you end up purging you bank account to fill this with enough mediocre aps to last through maybe a season. Camera whitebalance is very low and in a well lit room pictures come out grainy and dark. Video has a very slow frame rate and come out grainy, however audio is clear and loud enough. Physical games are an outrageous $30-$40 each and downloads range from $5-$15 online. These are not as good as Droid/Apple apps nor did they take longer to develop so why are they so expensive?? Disney/Pixar Licensing? I don't think so. The Jukebox on this thing has no animation and is simply a 5 song mp3 player so my son was instantly turned off to this device as where all he cares about these days is making music, this machine has zero of that. I do like the new battery cover design, making it easier than the Leappad1 to remove although the 4AA's go very quickly and big surprise: you have to spend extra to get the battery pack. An ion lithium fixed battery such as the iPad has would make this the ultimate children's tab but alas, greed prevails once again and I'm up to $300 on batteries, games and the unit. If you can get it for $100 it is worth it. If they continue to steamroll the parents with a $125-$150 price point they should at least re-reimburs the poor suckers who find themselves taken advantage of supply and demand (imagine you buy this and 5 minutes later it's $50 cheaper, how would you feel?). Some claim this isn't the place to leave gripes about distributing and price points. Are you daft?? If you buy a sandwich and the clerk punches you in the nose are you going to give them 5 stars because it was a well made sandwich? This IS a place to convey these types of grievances. We are all parents and this is the only place manufacturers, distributors and marketing looks at because they know their numbers count on our reviews! It's our last stronghold to be honest and to get honest results. People play fair when everyone else is looking and that goes for everything except packaging. Amazon has intuitively reserved a special place to allow them to fix any packaging issues you may have as where that's really all they do, they're a middle man. If we were to, for instance, boycott this kind of price gouging, they would invariably sell it at a fair price. Are you so quiet and shy you are afraid to use Amazon as a conduit to voice how you feel about every aspect of the products you've spent your hard earned money on? Don't you care that they've brought wall street to your child's door with the Leapad2 price fluxing? Why doesn't it make you sick? To those who claim I should sit down, shut up and fork over the $150 you are out of your minds and I feel sorry for you in your ho-hum complacency. You are the reason the rest of us have to fight twice as hard. WAKE UP. You read this for a reason."}

He had many favorite features on the product but here are a few of them:\n\n1. The front and back and back camera was his favorite feature!  He loves taking pictures and the LeapPad made it really easy!\n\n2. The music that came preloaded!  He listens to it all the time and I love that it is totally geared for kids!\n\n3. The Pet Pad where he could create and play with a pet.\n\n4. An art studio to create projects!\n\nWhy do I love this product as a Mom:\n\n1. I really like that it is an education product, he is learning and doesn't even realize it!  He thinks he is playing!\n\n2. This is a great product on road trips, it really can keep them engaged for a long time!\n\n3.  I can track my child's progress online and see where he is excelling or where he needs some help!\n\nWe love the LeapPad2 and I would highly recommend it!  I wish that I had this product when my older son was younger, he could have used an educational game like this!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "The LeapPad2 is designed for kids in the 3-9 age range. My almost 8 year old daughter has been begging for one and even promised to share it with her 4 year old brother. My kids love to play with our iPhones and the iPad but I'm always worried that they will drop or damage them. We have always had great experiences with LeapFrog products so I was especially eager to try out the LeapPad2.\n\nMy kids had no trouble at all navigating and switching between activities by themselves thanks to the larger screen and easily identifiable app icons. One of their favorite features was the front-and-back camera and video recorder. They loved being able to take a picture and then use the Photo Lab to add different effects to the picture. My daughter was over-the-moon excited to create her own cartoon in the Cartoon Director app. She got to choose a setting and then create different scenes to make her own very cool cartoon. One of my favorite features was the Ultra eBook app. I love that I am able to customize the reading level for each of my children and being able to record the story in my own voice for my kids to play back later is an amazing feature, especially for parents who have to travel for work. My kids absolutely love the LeapPad2 and I love that it's educational while still being fun and engaging.\n\nI highly recommend the LeapPad2. In fact, I will most likely be purchasing a second one so each of my kids can have one of their own. My kids have already spent hours exploring all the different things they can do and create. I do have to say that I will be purchasing the charging station because the batteries will definitely not last long considering how many things there are for kids to do on the LeapPad2.\n\nLeapFrog sent us the LeapPad2 to review but all opinions are 100% my own."}

The LeapPad2 has done an awesome job of integrating my daughter's favorite characters into learning games to keep her interested even longer. And, I LOVE that it has a built in camera AND video camera (front and back!) because she's really into taking pictures with my devices, so this frees up my stuff!

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0089RPUJ2", "review": "Here's just a list of things I noticed about the LeapPad2 in comparison to the Leap pad original. You'll find everything that you loved about the original version with some fun new additions and some really great changes.\n\n1. I noticed immediately is the darker surface color of the Leap Pad2. This is great for being able to tell which version your holding.\n2. Battery compartment: Easy open with a simple slide but not so easy the kids can do it. The original you needed a quarter or something similar.\n3. Leap Pad2 has 2 cameras: One on the backside for taking video's and pictures of your subject and one on the front side for taking pictures of your self.  Kids love this feature. They love seeing themselves on screen and watching as they make silly faces. They take photos, video's and use those to make\n4. You now get 4 GB of on board memory compared to the original with only 2 GB.\n5. You still get access to the incredible advantages of 325+ games and apps along with music and cartoons and learning games too.\n6. System takes 4 AA batteries and there is a recharger available.\n7. Like the original system it works with the LeapFrog Explorer games and apps as well as leapPad apps.\n8. Apps and games become more challenging the more your child plays.\n\nEver since the LeapPad 2 arrived my 4 yr old has not put it down. From dancing and singing with the fun music app from Kids Bop to watching video's from Elmo and playing games. He has not once asked me for help. It just amazes me how intelligent kids are now a days with electronics. We do own a tablet too but my son has not asked to use it since the leap Pad 2 arrived. He takes it every where with him. It's great entertainment on long car rides, doctor offices and for just kicking back for fun and for learning, too. My 6 year old also loves using it when his little brother gives him a turn.\n\nCreating different profiles is great when you have more than one child. They can customize the LeapPad2 especially for them and their grade level. I really like this with having 2 boys who are 2 yrs apart emotionally and mentally. The leapfrog is really durable. My son has dropped the original system several times and it just amazes me how it really preforms. The original hasn't lost its popularity around here and I suspect the Leap Pad 2 will be even more popular than the original. The games seem to process and play faster with the Leap Pad2 version and I think the voice could possibly be louder. I love that there seems to be a new app all the time to check out on the LeapFrog site.\n\ndisclosure: I am a blogger and this product was provided to me for the purpose of sharing my honest opinion in this review.

Complaints from my daughter since day one that the game shuts off on its own for no reason, I unfortunately always assumed it was user error.  Now the device  works for three minutes at a time while plugged in via the leapfrog AC adapter which I had to purchase separately.  The device has pretty much become a piece of junk since she has to restart her game or book every three minutes, can you imagine how frustrating that is?  I contacted customer service and since the warranty period is one year we are out of luck on a replacement or a fix.  Spent a lot of money on the device, apps and cords for 1.5 years of light use and now have a piece of worthless junk not to mention one disappointed little girl.  From what I see on ebay - all of the 'not working' leappads for sale, I am not the only victim of defective devices and expired warranty's so my advice to all who read - at the first sign of ANY trouble contact customer service or you too will be out of a lot of money."}
