I did a factory reset immediately wondering if I was throwing too much at this cheap budget tablet. Upon factory reset I just installed two apps. Facebook and the Kindle app. Facebook takes 5 minutes to open. Literally 5 minutes! And when the app loads it's slow and unresponsive. The Kindle app runs the same way.\n\nThe bottom line is this particular tablet is worthless. What good is it if you can't do anything?"}

Particularly nice as a gift for a young child who will mostly use it to play small mobile games.  You will need to upscale to better hardware for adults, or older younglings however."}

Updating the firmware is complicated cause you need to use your pc and ifollow a few step by step instructions do there is no easy firmware update solution within the tablet.

The tablet is quad core boasting a powerful A33 chip, but I find I'm getting stuck in attempting to open any app, regardless if it's the only app running out if I have five others.

I am a lite user of the device and have found the battery life to be very good. The battery charges without problems. The sound and camera are two items I don't use. However I have noticed the sound is poor and the camera is marginal. I have used this device several times outside  in the field during star gazing sessions and am satisfied with its performance. I already feel I have gotten my moneys worth out of it. ."}

I decided to pick this up and from the start, it began to have trouble starting up apps and began lagging up a storm when searching the web. Another disappointment was it would constantly disconnect from the WiFi randomly. I could only reconnect if I were to reboot it, which is annoying. So this product is alright for the money you're paying for it."}

This was a month of only casual Clash of Clans playing (and literally nothing else), so naturally I requested a replacement. First the representative had me try some \"solutions\" to try to get it working, but eventually sent me the info for return. Upon receipt of the replacement tablet I found I could not even set up the tablet because half the touchscreen would not work. I tried resetting factory settings and wiping the cache partition which did not solve the issue. Going back once again to the Dragon Touch representative, they wanted me to send the serial number printed on the back of the tablet so they could send software to fix the issue. Only problem is this tablet (and the previous one) did not have the serial number printed on the back, I'm assuming from some additional oversight at the Dragon Touch warehouse. I have lost all faith in this product. I will be pursuing the refund route this time, but will still be down the cost of shipping two return tablets with nothing to show for it but a headache and wasted time."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B015K3APWO", "review": "To begin with, the battery does not even charge fully in this. I followed the instructions and it still doesn't charge fully. It will maybe go up to 93-95% then it stops charging. Secondly, considering how slow the tablet is to even try to bring up it's originally installed applications and not ones that have been downloaded on it, I'm highly doubting this is a quad core. Whenever I try to bring up any application, it takes it at least 5 minutes to even bring up the front screen for the app. I've tried wiping it and starting fresh, but it's still the same. That's not even including the multiple times it crashes in one sitting.\n\nThe only positives I can give for this is the front and back camera, which are of decent quality.\n\nBasically, don't try to cheap your way into getting a tablet. Pay a little more and get one of better quality."}

I thought the placement of the mini-usb port was awkward at first, but it's in a good place to get a finger under it while holding the tablet in portrait orientation. The plastic case seems sturdy enough; it's certainly lighter than other tablets I've used. An hdmi port and a flash on the rear camera would have been nice, but I can get by without them. Can't say it's a five, but it's pretty good for the price."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B015K3APWO", "review": "For the price it's an ok tablet. It does what I expected it to do and that's stream movies from my computer. I haven't tried Hulu or Amazon video yet, but my network's pretty fast, so I should be ok. The screen came with a protective film already installed besides the one with instructions printed on it, I ditched is as it wasn't as responsive as I liked, with it removed it responds most of the time, but not 100% of the time. That's to be expected in this price point from a rather unknown brand. The screen resolution is ok, nothing to get excited about. Movies look good, but the color can look washed out depending on the viewing angle. Left to right is ok, up and down is where the color washes out. The built in speaker is ok, but plan on using headphones or external speakers if you plan on playing music or watching video. The front and rear cameras are crap, but I hadn't planned on using either of them. If you're on a budget and really want a tablet, then this class would be ok for most people. I on the other hand plan on getting a better tablet with more RAM and memory as this has 512MB RAM and 8GB storage with the system taking a huge chunk. It also has a micoSD card slot which supports 32GB of additional storage for movies, music, pictures or other files you wish to store."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B015K3APWO", "review": "The is a cheap an low tier tablet. Many people refer to it as a budget tablet because to the affordable price. Unlike many of the people here I actually paid money for this tablet. So, my review is pretty unbiased.\n\nWhen I was first looking at this tablet, I was not expecting much. I mainly wanted to use this for school (I am in my third year at a university). I could put a lot of my textbook PDFs on an SD card and read them from the tablet. I could also look at notes and powerpoint presentations for my various classes as well as keep a schedule/to do list on the tablet. I just had those two or three simple things in mind. That is what I planned on doing.\n\nHowever, I have not turned on this tablet in months.\n\nIt isn't that this tablet wasn't able to do any of what I expected. It's that the interface is garbage and the tablet is super slow.\nThe touch screen was very unresponsive. I kept having to smash my fingers into the screen to click into anything. The web browsing isn't very fluid and is very clunky.\nThe tablet is very slow. I spent around 5-10 minutes trying to load a power point presentation on the tablet.\nPDFs are the same was. Many times when I scroll, the tablet just won't respond.\n\nThe is basically a large phone, except a lot slower.\nI wish I had not bought it."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B015K3APWO", "review": "First off, I would like to say that you should not get drawn to a tablet for the price! Everyone really wants \"as low as you can go\" tablets these days. One look at the brightness when I turned it on, I realized that I made a huge mistake buying this piece of crap. Also the speed of it and internet made this tablet more worthless than a tablet of advil.\nPros: NA\nCons:\n1. Brightness. I tried putting it on the highest setting, but that made it WORSE. My old iphone 2g has better brightness that this piece of crap from a junkyard. I bought this so I could use it at the park or on my front porch, but the screen went black. I had to go in my closet to do anything.\n2. The loading speed. After I booted up the system, (which took 5 minutes) I went straight to the play store to download snapchat (lame, right?) After 10 minutes, the app downloaded, I opened it and it took 30 seconds to load, which was a major improvement, compared to the internet speed, but we'll get to that later. Snapchat actually worked OK.\n3. The Internet speed. I searched up \" weather\" on my junkpiece, and this thing would refuse to load right next to the WiFi router! My brother is a brainy at technology, so I asked him what was up. First thing he said was to always buy name-brand tech. Boy, did I learn my lesson. He couldn't fix it, and, for the record, this is an adult that is going to Marquette next year as an engineer.\nI want to just say, that if you are considering buying this tablet, go with a kindle fire instead. To find it, just search it in the Amazon search box."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B015K3APWO", "review": "Even if it's inexpensive, you still want it to work.  I like the size, visibility, etc, but the device is not useful because it freezes up constantly and has to be rebooted several times a day.  It doesn't seem to matter what the application is, it will freeze up with Facebook, games, news sites, you name it.  It takes many times longer to do anything with the tablet than my desktop because of the freezing issue.  Also, it has relatively low memory and I'm frequently uninstalling apps to make room for new files.  Camera resolution is the lowest I've had since my very first digital camera in the late 1990s and even though it takes panorama shots, you have to move so slowly, they are very poor quality.  Streaming is ok given a strong wifi signal.  If you get this, be sure to get a screen guard too, as the glass scratches very easily."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B015K3APWO", "review": "I bought this as an inexpensive replacement for two much more expensive tablets my dog destroyed. Maybe this would be a good choice for someone who has never used a tablet or smart phone, but experienced users will find the slow response and lag time extremely frustrating. When I bought this, I did not expect this to measure up to my previous tablets by any means. I simply wanted an affordable device to watch Netflix, read email and read/post on Facebook. That's it. Accessing apps can take a minute or more, often nothing happens at all. Posting even a short email or Facebook comment can take 2-3 minutes as you wait for the app to respond, but Netflix works well with this tablet. Using a good memory booster app helps a lot. I gave this three instead of two stars because the screen quality is quite good - crisp picture with nice color - as is the sound quality. If you just want to watch movies, this tablet will be fine. If you want to do anything else, upgrade."}

However, I was disappointed at how slow it was. Yes I know it's a cheap tablet, but I kind of expected it to be better than the junk I received. It's made of cheap materials and when you barely twist it it makes cracking noises. When I got it in the mail the screen was partly warped in a corner ( that corner screen still worked though), it loses battery pretty quickly, and is overall not worth the money unless you prefer cheap tablets and only need one for a short while.\nSummary:\n1. Cheaply made\n2. Short battery life\n3. Extremely slow\n4. Not worth the money\n5. Easily breaks"}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B015K3APWO", "review": "I initially bought this tablet because the value was phenomenal. 50 dollars for a machine with clear picture and reliable speed. I thought it would make a great and affordable gift for a young relative. Functionally, the tablet does all it claims to do, however, the first tablet I bought quickly succumbed to a faulty power button. The tablet could not be turned on or off manually by the power button after approximately 3 months.\n\nCustomer service was mildly adequate, however, the only solution they gave me for the problem was pay for repairs. The repair would cost me approximately 30 dollars. 20 dollars shy of a new tablet. I assume with a price so low that is the nature of the beast, but the tablet only experienced approximately 3 months of use. I was surprised to find out that there was nothing else the company could  do to make it right.\n\nNonetheless, I figured  i figured that I had just received a lemon and this was sheer happenstance. I purchased another one to replace the broken one. At this value, I was certain that it would not break the bank and that my nephew would be more conscientious about taking care of it. After 4 months, the same issue occurred. The power button failed to activate the tablet.\n\nIt was unresponsive and unusable. This issue occurred twice. I paid 100 dollars for two tablets that barely had the durability to last a year. This isn't right. Customer service was never really able to make it right. I can't support this product, and I don't think people should buy it.\n\nNotes: The tablet was always in a protective casing, and while it experienced heavy use, the screen barely had a scratch on it. The tablet was well taken care of, but its durability lacked integrity."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B015K3APWO", "review": "Great for little kids who need something to bang around and obviously it won't cost you too much if they break it. The one thing that is super lame about this tablet is that the speaker is on the back of the tablet (as opposed to the front or sides), which means that if you're child is watching a video or playing a game, and if he's holding it upright, then the volume from the tablet is blasting straight backwards from the tablet. This may sound silly, but it means that the kids needs to turn the volume up a couple extra clicks so that he can hear it, but the people in the rest of the room are hearing it blasting. Make sense? Other than that, it's great."}

I am sure with a screen protector it will give it a better feel when lets be honest, the feel of the product doesn't matter too much when it is placed in a case.

I mention this because these tablets are worlds apart BUT that is to be expected.\n\nAnyone making a purchase for this unit should manage expectations. Overall it works well for most basic tasks but it might not suit every person or every need.\n\nThis is my main goal with a device such as this and this tablet specifically.\n\nI want to be able to...\nSurf the web occasionally\nCheck my emails\nAdjust me thermostat (when as home)\nRun Torque Pro\nPlayback music/movies occasionally (mostly YouTube)\nView WiFi cameras\nScreencasting (It has the option, MIGHT use it MAYBE)\n\nI don't need it to play games, none will ever be installed.\n\nI have used the MicroSD as well as an OTG cable and both work fine and allow me to view text, pics and video without issue.\n\nIt's not the fastest out there but for the price it meets my needs.\n\nIt includes a charger or you can use MicroUSB to charge so if you happen to want to use the MicroUSB AND charge you can leave the OTG cable plugged in (as an example).\n\nImages look nice, sound isn't bad at all but of course the cameras aren't going to be the best but they're fairly decent.\n\nMy only real complaint is the battery life is on the low side. You should charge as suggested in the manual (10 hours first two times then 7 hours after that). I do not need any tablet to run for very long...about 2 hours max at one time so this lasts well beyond that and does well in standby...lasts most if not all day but depends on what I leave running of course.\n\nTo sum this up...if like me you only need pretty basic use then for just under $50 bucks this works but if you think you're going to multi-task and run any game you would be wrong.\n\nFor me it is good but my advice is to manage your expectations and shop accordingly. I would not own this as my only or main tablet but as a spare for what I listed above it is just fine.\n\nAdding more memory would go a long way to make this a more well liked product.\n\nReview sample provided free or at a discounted price for a fair, unbiased, and honest review."}

I didn't want to spend a ton of money to see her not use it because she couldn't figure it out. Instead it has been dicarded because you can not do anything online with it. Even showing a wifi signal it will not update facebook and websites are unavailable.\nThe only thing it is good for is playing download games offline."}

The replacement unit was barely usable as it has very slow response even though I don't have much installed on it and it cannot find Wifi very often.

They are a little slower then my ipad, but it is expected. They do feel very cheap and plasticky, but then again, you get what you pay for. I have them always on, always plugged in, and I have had zero issues so far with either of the two I bought. I am happy with the purchase and would buy them again."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B015K3APWO", "review": "I'm not sure what I was expecting with an Android tablet from China. The product had a strange chemical smell for the first 24 hours of opening it. The screen is sort of cheap and its responsiveness is a lot less sensitive than I would like. You really have to make a firm press to get most touch events to register. The materials of the casing itself are normal plastic and look like something you find on dubious products from a flea market. It advertises an IPS display, but its specs do not allow the device to fully take advantage of that.\n\nThe quad core processors don't really provide any punch. It's not all that surprising, considering it's a $4 processor. So, considering that, it's a fair deal. The RAM is sufficient for small tasks, but I really don't think I can use this tablet for anything, but development (for low-end devices). Potentially, the newer model would be a better deal, but this is definitely an entry-level tablet that gives a good deal for what's being offered."}

I am a geek, but not a TECH geek, so if I say something incorrectly, please forgive me lol :-p\n\nOk, so as you can see, This tablet looks awesome!  My pictures are never altered, these are raw, original photos, of me un-boxing my two (2) tablets I purchased. I purchased one for my son, and one for my daughter, and loaded them with STRICTLY educational programs/apps for when I need them to sit still while I have to clean the house, or have a doctors appt.\n\nThe stats on the tablet can be found in the description section under the actual product on amazon.com, so I am not exactly sure what else to add....but what I can say is that:\n\n1: The battery life was really long-lasting initially....but after only 2 months of using this tablet, the battery life doesn't last longer than 3-4 hours, within a 24/hr time frame. My kids do not use this tablet every day all day, so I was disappointed to see the battery life decrease so soon on these tablets.\n\n2. The Camera: The camera is the equivalent of built-in webcam, from a cheap laptop...nothing fancy. The picture quality is not horrible, but it's not great either. You can see your photos, but you can also see the unclarity/pixel used to create the photos...if that makes sense.\n\nIf you have anymore questions, comments, just message me :-)!\n\nThanks\nxoxo"}

Some of the games that were just completely broken by this tablet are Diamond Dash, Final Fantasy tactics, Gta san andreas, any 3d racing game, agario, don't touch the white tiles..... If you are looking for a gaming tablet I would pass this one up. Go for the 10 Inch octa core X10, It's double the price but the quality is amazing for 3d games.\n\n  Android on this tablet will not allow you to wright to the SD with all of my favorite apps and so I'm basically stuck with the 8GB it comes with unless I want to root the thing and so far I haven't found a good root for it. King root, and towel root do not work.\n\n  the IPS display is on the lower end but is vivid and looks good non the less, but trying to use a stylus is impossible.\n\n I would have rated five stars if they had advertised this tablet as a reader/minor web surfing tablet, but I will give 3 stars because of good quality, nice design, hi battery life. And because the charger gets very very hot when plugged into the tablet almost to the point where I feel its gonna melt."}

The battery life is ok (It will always be on a power source, so it's no big deal to me)\n\nThere are some minor things that affect how my project was being physically laid out. I'm building a OBD2 to Tablet, Dash display for my truck. The location of the buttons and ports are in somewhat odd locations. I'm not really holding it against the tablet as my test device for the project.\n\nI popped in a 64gb microSD from an old phone and boom, all my music and pictures were there. I was very please about that.\n\nI didn't really buy this device to play with, but during my setup I thoroughly enjoyed playing with it. I'm considering getting the bigger version for my son.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B015K3APWO", "review": "I had this Tablet for a month now and found some problems. (Got it on January 28, this review has been edited on February 27)\n\nThe Dragon Touch Y88X Plus is a fun tablet, it's a great deal if you're looking for a low budget tablet and Googleplay provides with ton of apps, so the fun can keep going.\n\nPerformance: If you're just looking for a tablet for reading this one is ok. Some apps that demand more power were pretty slow to load, games like Galaxy of Heroes and Marvel Academy sometimes freezes for 10 seconds on the loading screen, other games closed itself if it's too much for the tablet to handle (like Pocket Mortys)\n\nCamera: The back camera is ok, it's like a camera from a phone from 2009, but when using it for apps the camera would be upside down and rotating it would just set off the auto-rotate for the screen (I heard this could be fixed, but I didn't invest time into the camera part of the tablet). The front camera is just horrible, I have it set on auto adjust, but everything is just orange if I do that.\n\nBattery Life: When playing a game it would take about 3 hours for it to get to 5% from 100%. When you're just using it for everyday use, it takes about 5 hours. I used this on the bus and it's an hour trip bus, usually when I get on the bus it's 100% and when I get off the bus it's 80-90%.\n\nCharger: The charger is a HUGE downer for me. The plug to the tablet is loose and wobbly. As of today (February 27), it doesn't charge my tablet if my tablet is faced up on the table. It's kinda like some old Sega Genesis consoles where you have to position it just right for the plug to turn the console on.\nI read some reviews saying the charger doesn't hold a charge and how other chargers bought from Amazon doesn't work, but the charger from my old tablet works fine.\n\nDurability:It feels like it would break if you drop it, but that's to be expected with the cost, I highly recommend getting a case.\n\nSD Card: The tablet takes a MicroSD card, Google doesn't allow putting apps on the SD cards now, but that isn't really the tablet's fault (Just letting everyone know, this is not going to affect my rating for the tablet)\nIf you want extra storage for movies, books, and music then an SD card is a good way to get that extra storage. The Largest the tablet could read is 32GB.\n\nStorage: 8GB isn't much in this day and age, but gotta remember this is a 50 dollar tablet.\nFor 8GB I ran out of space from all the apps I downloaded and I had to remove a lot for extra room. (This wouldn't be a big deal if Google allowed you to move apps to SD cards like before)\n\nLongevity: I will update this if my tablet breaks or if it's still alive 5 months from now.\n\n(This review will be updated once I have more experience with the tablet)"}

I figured I would find a third party app and use it as parental control.\nOne of the two I ordered had a screen problem, so I sent it back, and got a replacement.\nAbout a week after Christmas, and my kids repeatedly telling me that they keep restarting on their own, I decided to factory reset, drain the battery, etc.  They worked well for a bit, but then started some quirky antics.  Needless to say, they're only $50, so you can't expect they're going to be perfect.  The biggest downer is the fact that there is so much preinstalled software on here, and it randomly pops up while my kids are trying to use them.  They have no idea what it is or what to do.  They just press every button they can, and now they're in danger of downloading other stuff, bringing their tablet to me, and saying \"daddy, its doing it again\".\nFast forward a month and a half now, and I finally gave up on my sons tablet.  All he wanted to do was listen to music and play angry birds.  The restarting and freezing was out of control.  I basically took his tablet and told him I'd get him a new one.  I did a bit of research, and really feel I found the best option FOR LESS MONEY!  I got a 7\" Kindle for him, with offers, which brought the price down.  Then I happened to get it on sale.  THEN, I looked up how to get the Google Play store on it (which doesn't require any \"rooting\", just following simple directions, and a one time PC use).  The kindle is much more solid, never freezes, has better battery life, and , best of all, NO POPUPS OR RANDOM SOFTWARE!.\nI'm now going to purchase another one for my daughter, knowing hers will eventually die.\nI did contact dragon touch, and they had me check a bunch of things, and then offered to take it back and either fix or send me a new one.  I'd pay for shipping, which I'm sure would be minimal, maybe $5 or so.  But I've decided to just cut my losses.  I know the product is inferior, and I learned my lesson.  The company seems like they're doing their best to help out, but the  product itself is something I wish I never purchased in the first place."}

Amazing things about this tablet is that it is very cheap (affordable), it's very tiny so it's easy to put it in your bag or your purse, the two types of chargers are amazing, battery-life is acceptable, even with a low ram it works exactly like a ipad mini, it feels better than the amazon $50 buck tablet, downloading is fast, and no problems with freeze screens or breakable screens.

I dropped my amazon $50 buck tablet on the rug and it instantly broke, however, when i dropped this on the rug it didn't break. I LOVE THIS TABLET!! This is great for kids since its not too expensive, and its easy for kids to watch whatever they want on YouTube. All 20 apps i downloaded worked flawless. I will recommend this tablet to anyone who just wants to relax. The best thing about this is that if i lose it, it wouldn't waste as much as if i bought a ipad."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B015K3APWO", "review": "Very poorly made tablet. The device is constantly lagging in videos, movies, and games. It seems that every 20 seconds it has to stop and buffer. This is with both online and offline games and videos. Not only that, but if left sitting around for more than an hour, the device cuts itself off the internet and refuses to reconnect. The only way to get it to reconnect to the internet is to turn it off and on again. Finally, it just started freezing up on me to the point where it would be stuck on one page and it was not able to navigate off that page or turn it off. It simply stayed on the same screen until the device finally died. Very disappointed after reading so many reviews that made it sound like a quality product."}

This will be great for him to read books on, play a few games, etc. Both kids already have school laptops but this will really be good for those times when he has to study but does not want to take his laptop (our school is going to all online work) although I still believe in old school books the world is changing :-)\n\nDon't hesitate for the price I don't see how you can go wrong."}

I don't watch much on it, so I can't give a review as to streaming, but it's been good for email, weather, and pinterest. It doesn't get super loud, which is fine, because I don't stream on it. The one negative that I have to mention is the internet cuts out periodically. But all I have to do is turn it off and on again, and the internet is back. I have been very happy with this tablet."}

The charge didn't last at all on the thing, I went to watch Hulu the video had green lines going through it, and my game wouldn't function at all. My phone plays my games better than this thing. I regrettably had to return this and paid an extra 70 bucks and bought a galaxy tablet instead. I'm sure that one will be great. Another thing is this thing didn't even have a micro SD slot, and came with an ac adapter as well.

Some trouble with using the \"barrel plug\" to charge, but talking with TabletExpress revealed that the USB plug near the barrel would also accept current inward, and that can accept a 2,000mA charge the same way the barrel plug charge port will.  This makes travel logistics easier anyhow, since I have a couple of 5VDC @ 2,000mA wall wards with USB \"A\" sockets.\n\nThrow a 32GB card in, and you've got a great small tablet to work with - movies, music, references, Internet, Bluetooth - it's done everything I've asked of it so far.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B015K3APWO", "review": "But, I went off all the great reviews instead thinking perhaps some people are too picky. I was wrong. Now I see apparently, if you gave a rave review the company sent a free gift to the reviewer? That makes sense. I purchased this in July 2015 for my son during the Amazon Prime Day. After charging it fully as recommended, everything was fine. I was disappointed at how fast the battery died, my son is only 5 years old so he has limited time on the tablet, only an hour, so you may as well get used to charging it twice a day or use it while it's charging. I noticed the wall charger never seemed to fit right, but it always charged it to 99%. I think I saw 100% two times. And yes, it does get very hot. Hot enough for a child to say \"mommy, this makes me sweaty\" because he'd have the tablet on his lap, sitting on the couch while it was charging.\n\nSo the day finally came when we lost the charger, sometime in Jan. 2016. I ordered and returned 3 different chargers from Amazon because none of them charged the tablet. I contacted Amazon customer service (insanely kind and helpful if you have the pleasure to speak with them!) and I was put in touch with the company. The company told me to \"charge\" it then hold the power for 20 secs. Yeaaa......here in lies the problem: I have no charger that works people! I was contacting the company to order a new charger directly (didn't see it on their website). Yet, all I'm told is that parts warranty ends at 90 days, returns and exchanges up to 30 days after purchase. I'm told everything but whether or not I can order a new charger. I did find the USB charger and let it charge overnight and that's not working either. So I'm thinking the tablet has just gone kaput. In less than a year. Do yourself a favor, spend a few extra bucks on something better!"}

I knew 50 bucks would not get me much but I am very surprised with the outcome.\nPros: Batter life lasts for a whole movie plus more.  The picture is good, not great. The weight is nice and light.\nCons: The picture/video for a graphic intense movie is off. You can see how grainy it can get on Netflix. 512 MB of RAM is not nice because it slows the tablet down after you use 3 or 4 apps and don't close them out. The sound is absolutely horrible unless you're on bluetooth or Aux cord. When you grasp the tablet the cheap construction allows for it to creak and squeak as if it will crack if twisted. Also I do not like the charging cable being a prong-like charger. Wish it had micro usb connection for charging because with my son he tends to push it in too hard and I am anticipating him bending the charger any day now.\nI would overall recommend this device if you just want something to pass time and keep kids or yourself occupied for a couple hours. Nice to jump on and go through emails and minor stuff. Just don't expect to write a mid-term paper on it. Want a tablet and have a budget, GET IT."}

But, it doesn't change the fact that the tablet is absolutely amazing just for existing at a price like this. For the sole reason of being a fully touchscreen Android tablet for $50, this gets a 5/5."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015K3APWO", "review": "I found it a  budget tablet by comparing with my ipad and samsung galaxy table.. Pretty good performance and usability. This size tablet,  7\", is the sweetheart size that I can use for everyday communication. My wife and daughter love it. Easy to toss in my bag and go. A good resource in my professional work. Very good  for entertainment. Very vibrant, and responsive.  Moves right along with games, movies/videos, presentations, social apps and everything else I use. 8GB may not seem like a lot of space out of the box, but if like me you find 8GB might be a bit limiting, the addition of an Micro-SD card is adding additional space via the micro-SD card slot on this tablet. In terms of accessories, the tablet has just the basics, Dragon Touch 7\" tablet, USB cable, Wall charger. Really all I could need right out of the box.\nOverall, a really great budget tablet for spec's and performance. The Dragon Touch Y88X Plus 7'' Quad Core Tablet is a great bet when screen size and connectivity is a must. I will recommend it fellow co-workers."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B015K3APWO", "review": "I bought this as a replacement for my small-but-clunky laptop, which is painfully slow and is surprisingly much of a hassle to travel with because the power cord block is large, heavy, and oddly shaped.  I also didn't want to replace my cell phone with a smart phone and have to pay for an expensive data plan.  So - I got this tablet instead, and I'm delighted with it.\n\nPros:  It's small, easy to carry, and its power cord block is slim and light, like the ones that come with a cell phone.  It's faster than the laptop, the screen is bright and sharp, and it has available apps for everything I want to do when I'm away from home.  Securing it with a password is easy.  Kindle books look beautiful with on it (there's a Kindle app).  Keeping up with email is a snap.  I thought I would have trouble surfing the web because of the small screen (I use a 20\" flat screen with my desktop), but I adapted pretty quickly.  I like that there is a slot for a microSDHC card.  It also has Bluetooth.\n\nCons:  I still find typing on a touch screen tricky because there is no tactile feedback, but at least I don't hate it as much as on the last device I used (an old Kindle).  Battery life is not that great when online - and Pandora seems to use it up pretty quickly - but email and games can be downloaded and reviewed/played with in Airplane Mode, which uses very little battery life.  The speaker are VERY tinny.  I'll try earphones.\n\nBottom line:  Does all I expected of it and more."}

I am basing this on having owned a Dragon Touch 10\" for myself and one I purchased as a gift for my mother.  Such a great value.  Absolutely NO problems with the 10\" and when I saw the 7\" tonight I had to order it. It's not often enough you find Bluetooth in a 7\" tablet.  I need it for interface projects with Raspberry Pi and Arduinos.\n\nI have purchased inexpensive 7\" tablets before from my local Staples and I was less than satisfied.  If this 7\" is like the 10\" Dragon Touch tablets I have previously purchased I will be back to upgrade my rating.\n\nI have never rated an item before receiving it.  I am usually quite jaded and suspicious.  This company has made me very happy with my past purchases."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B015K3APWO", "review": "My 5-6 year old Kindle Fire doesn't hold a charge any longer, so I figured I'd upgrade to something modern.  This had a much faster quad core processor, and reviews were decent, so...\n\nPerformance is disappointing.  The limited amount of RAM I think keeps it from being a real contender.  Running more than one application at a time is generally pretty sluggish, and you know the CPU is more than capable.  Even Candy Crush slows down, what the heck?  Once the application is loaded into memory everything runs fine.  My company provides an LG G3 phone which totally blows this away in terms of performance.  Again, more RAM...\n\nAs for build quality, I was prepared for a cheaper feel but even still I was surprised.  Having been used to the aforementioned LG, Kindle Fire, and various iPads, I was still blown away how cheap and plasticy this felt.  Not a deal breaker for me, but if you like that solid, brushed aluminum feel you should look elsewhere.\n\nThe screen is decent, exactly what I expected.  For general use I wouldn't let negative comments about the screen dissuade you.\n\nThe biggest annoyance is that the unit has a non-USB charging cable.  Why?!?  I have a fleet of micro-USB charged devices, and now I have to have a separate one for this?  It will charge from USB, but very, very slowly.\n\nAnyway, for single tasking activities this is OK.  Personally I would have preferred to save my 50 bucks and put it towards something better.  It's a good value, and would do great for someone who wanted to hand a tablet to their child and not worry about they losing it.  Or for backpacking across Europe  this would be a good internet device you wouldn't cry over if stolen.  It has its place, but it's definitely not a premium tablet."}

It has a very slight minor lag when first running the game etc but it smooth out as you load the game more. There seems to be a small touch 'dead spot' on the top right corner but if u somehow touch around it it will work, not really a big issue to me for the games and things i do but just to be noted for others. The product is light and can fit in my back pocket and the screen size was perfect for me cause i didn't like hulking around the bigger tablets. For the price and specs this product has, it cant be beat.... although i haven't tried other tablet within this price range yet (maybe amazon Fire would be next closet). I would highly recommend this product for those looking for a budget tablet which anyone can use, even my dad who is 70+ yrs old got the hang of it within the 1st day of playing around with it.\n\nI gave it 4/5 stars cause I have only gotten to use it for 1 day of receiving it and will update as i find any more errors/kinks to report. I am not getting paid or did not receive this unit to test/review and this is my honest opinions."}

I don't know why but i'm assuming the GPS sensor is a bit off to the point the only way to resolve that is to just set it to manual setting. For a quad core tablet to me it feels like a single core 1.2 ghz meaning feels slow to me. Overall I can tolerate these minor annoyances it produces well only because I'm a bit of a geek at this stuff so its not that much of a pain to deal with. All that matters to me is that it turns on and do what it suppose to do........kinda. As the old saying goes you get what you pay for.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B015K3APWO", "review": "When I write reviews, I try to be fair to the price range of the device. For a 50 dollar tablet it is what it is, a cheap tablet. I will agree that the technology (or lack there of) is decent if not slightly above what the device is valued for. That being said this tablet is just too far behind the times in terms of technology. Here's my experience with this tablet.\n\nWeb Browsing\n--------------------------\nRunning on Google Chrome for android was a choppy mess, sometimes with a delay of an entire second to register a scroll function, typing was choppy aswell.\n\nMusic\n--------------------------\nNeedless to say, the tiny rear speaker is  absolutely poor in sound quality, but it is also quiet, next to inaudible outdoors walking down the street. As someone who listens to music with headphones this isn't an issue, So imagine my surprise when I plug in my headphones (Audio Technica m50x) and discover that the sound coming from my headphones were poor quality aswell. If I had to judge, the sound caps out at the lower end of 50mhz, absolutely ZERO sub bass. The sound is tiny, spiky, and just plain boring. I wanted a simple tablet to listen to music with, this isn't the tablet for that. Music lovers beware.\n\nMultitasking\n-------------------\nNo. Just, no. The quad core processor in this is good enough to handle multitasking but the device is throttled by that pathetic 0.5 gig of ram. Dragon Touch shot themselves in the foot by supplying this device with such an unacceptably small amount of ram.\n\nGaming\n---------------\nIt can play casual games just fine. As far as Higher end games go. It absolutely FAILS in this category. Real Racing 3 on low settings with no other applications running in background was as I expected, Choppy with extreme frame rate loss. I wouldn't have bothered including higher end games in the review had the device not allude to it being gaming capable by advertising it being \"3d game ready\".\n\nCamera\n-----------------\nAgain, as I expected, Not good either. Video and camera shot in native 4:3 ratio with no settings to adjust the picture. Video quality I estimate films at around 15 frames a second at around the quality of a youtube video at 240p. Sound quality of capture also wasn't too great either.\n\nDisplay\n----------------\nNot HD, Pixels are visible even when sitting away from device. Don't let the advertising fool you.\n\nDurability\n---------------\nEverything from the body to the screen is thin plastic. A child could snap this tablet in half. Very flimsy. I'm not too confident in this devices build quality.\n\nOverall.\n---------------\nAs I said before, it is what it is. It's a cheap tablet. Though in today's world where most phones run at around 2 gigs (4 times the amount) of ram and most applications require more ram now then ever. It's easy to break, so I cant even recommend giving this to a child as a cheap toy, the sound is bad, the camera is bad, and my over all experience with this device is well, bad.\n\nThis tablet is just too under powered for today's world, and has left me to figure out what to do with a 50 dollar paper weight. Don't let the price seduce you into buying it. Just save up and buy something better."}

Only complaint I have is some games had stuttering (the newer games that require more power).\n\nCamera: The camera doesn't really stand out for me, it's a pretty low to medium end camera.\n\nBattery Life: When playing a game it would take about 2 hours for it to get to 5% from 100%. When you're just using it for everyday use, it takes about 6 hours.\n\nDurability:It feels like it would break if you drop it, but that's to be expected with the cost, I highly recommend getting a case.\n\nLongevity: I will update this if my tablet breaks or if it's still alive 5 months from now.\n\n(This review will be updated once I have more experience with the tablet)"}

On another note it's processor and capability to accomplish basic tasks is atrocious and it will freeze and force close in streaming apps and games alike. Secondly, the screen quality is rough around the edges but it is not the worste, the construction of the tablet itself is low profile and relatively small and portable, although it feels fragile and I was almost forced to buy a case, overall this tablet will be a useful for very baseline tasks like Google docs and browsing the internet. This tablet is a two star tablet because there are better ones out there, I do not advise this as a good purchase for yourself or for a present. Thank you guys for your time "}

And was very happy that it didn't take long  getting delivered!\nOkay this is the start of the review.\n\nWell it starts like this, listen when you open the box, it comes with 1 USB cable (the USB cable doesn't charge the device)\nalso comes with D/C power charger that plugs into the wall, but if you love USB like i do, there is a possibiltiy that you could\njust buy a USB Sync/Charging cable from somewhere else. Because I've heard people going into panic mode because\nthe tablet will not charge with the USB cable. The performance is incredible. I just love the Quad Core processor that's running\nat 1.2GHZ (on the box it says 1.3GHZ, but when i loaded up everything it stated that i had 1.2GHZ QC)\n\nLet me explain something to you guys about the battery, i know many of you kind of worry why the battery dies so fast.\nBelow are the causes.\n\nRunning, multiple apps\nBluetooth enabled\nWIFI (Only if you just want to sit around and play a game without accessing the internet)\nScreen Brightness Levels... (You should be fine with the default screen brightness)\nSpotify (eventually if you are listening to music for a long period of time, it kill your battery life)\nAlso, running Spotify and launching apps at the sametime such as Google etcetera.\n\nIf you we're wondering about setting it up for the first time with your name and other personal data.\nYou'll have to download apps on to the tablet because the tablet doesn't come with pre-loaded goodies.\nAlso make sure you enable WIFI once you set the system up, when i purcahsed mine i had to enable\nWIFI in order to surf the web, just mentioning incase you all may not know about this just helping everyone out!\n\nIf you are wondering abou the screen, It's a pretty decent screen, it's very responsive, i had another android device\nmade like a sony psp, and it was junk, you cant to press so hard on the screen just to get it working...\nAnd anyways, if you guys are wondering if this gives out HD, sorry to tell you but the tablet isn't in\nHigh-Def, the native screen resolution is 1024x600, but it has beautiful rich vibrant colors when looking\nat beautiful places like Brazil, Dubai and here home in america! But if i we're you I'd buy the tablet it's\ngreat for everyhting without slow down, as long as you kill the apps running in the background you should\nbe just fine. Because all the traffic that's going into your tablet.\n\nPROS:\nSpeedy quick 1.2GHz quad core processor\nGreat for playing video games, as long you are in a wifi area\nPrice I do believe I've paid 60 dollars for it and a lovely screen protector\nGreat performance in most games, never had  hicup yet..\n\nCONS:\nThe Volume Rocker, it gets confusing for me depends on how i am holding my tablet\ngets annoying sometimes,\nHeadset Jack It's not really a \"CON\" but i dislike the fact that i sit the tablet in my lap\nthe plug from the headphone jack pokes me...\nCamera, well i don't expect the camera to be fantasic, but the quality is very low,\nbut i must say that my iPhone 3Gs, has a better camera\n\nAlso by the way I've added some photos of my tablet, i did it so you know what you are getting.\nEnjoy hope i helped some of you all"}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B015K3APWO", "review": "I bought 2 of these, one for each of my kids for Christmas. At $50 each, it was a huge win for them and not too costly for us. Setting them up, they felt like standard, vanilla Android tablets. They're a little under-powered, but again, at $50, what would you expect?\n\nI recently noticed they both have ads that periodically jump on top of all other apps, coming from a core \"weater\" app that you can't uninstall. It also comes with some DU Start saver app (or similar), which also pops up over apps, also system based and cannot be uninstalled. I checked into \"rooting\" these devices so I can remove these apps, but they require some really sketchy apps from China. Nothing worked after a few tries, and I wasn't willing to install an app on my PC that was entirely in Mandarin.\n\nBottomline, it's kinda sketchy, there's a bunch of ads you have to get used to, but it does the job. If I'd known the full story, I'd have gone the extra $50 to get tablets that aren't supported by sketchy 3rd party ads."}

As far as cons go it has a lower resolution screen and lower resolution pictures. The screen transition are not smooth and can be laggy.

The screen stopped working correctly on one of our tablets after about 6 months of light use.  The screen filled with horizontal lines that blurred any displayed contents.  No problem, right?  The product has a 1 year limited warranty, so getting a repair or replacement shouldn't be a big issue.\n\nWrong.\n\nWhen I contacted the seller (AKASO Store) about the warranty, they quoted me a price of around $30 to repair the tablet.  When I asked about the 1 year warranty, they replied that they do indeed have a 1 year warranty, but that it's not a \"free warranty.\"  Anything beyond 3 months requires the buyer to pay for warranty services!  Calling a paid repair service a warranty is deceptive and unethical.  Don't be fooled by this product's misleading warranty promises."}

He likes the sleek look, the ultra fast performance, easy setup and \"better \" graphics. I researched this for hours and felt it was the one with the most up to date technical features.  I would say more but he won't give it up for me to be able to play with it at all.  He is totally immersed.  This review therefore is more from a kids experiential view point and a mother who waiting patiently to play with it.  Far exceeds my tablet."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B015K3APWO", "review": "I purchased three of these for my nephews and niece for Christmas.  They arrived a few days ago, and I took them out of the packaging to make sure all of them worked.  First off, even after plugging these in and letting them charge, one of the three didn't hold a charge at all.  The other two had their batteries drain off the charger in less than an hour with nothing running.  The power buttons on 2 of the 3 you could hold for 5 or 6 minutes before the device powered on.  The date/time zone wouldn't save.  They keep reverting to central time, and use a 24-hour clock even when you uncheck that option.  The KitKat 4.4 OS also doesn't update. AT ALL.  Finally, these tablets are *cheap*, flimsy plastic that actually bends in the hands of adult with very little force applied.  I can't imagine this product in the hands of a 5, 8 and 10 year old.  They'd be busted before Christmas Day was over.  I'm returning all three and buying Kindle Fires.  Lesson to me -- you get what you pay for.  I wanted to make sure the kids had an Android device to get access to the PlayStore, but these tablets aren't worth what it will cost to return them, let alone the cost of the actual device. (Edited to add, one of the most annoying things about these tablets is that the charger is a push in/plug adapter and not a standard USB/sync cable.  You can't charge these tablets with anything but the cord they came with, and getting the pin connector in so you hear it snap into place is not something your child can easily accomplish. Please keep that in mind)"}

The product shipped and arrived quickly.  I was a little let down by the feel and display quality as the case felt a lot cheaper than all the other tablets my family and I have (kindle fire, RCA, and Visio).  I let the tablet charge, displayed 100%, and then registered and filled out all the start up information.  Once I unplugged it from the wall charger the tablet shut off and wouldn't turn back on.  I plugged it back into the wall charger and the tablet powered back up.  I called Dragon Touch tech support and was given the run around and instructed to contract Amazon directly.  Needless to say I won't be buying another Dragon Touch product and unless they do some serious product upgrades neither should anyone reading this."}

With 512mb ram, all processes are just creaking by as thgee bulk of memory are running android essentials.if it was just running very, very,VERY few apps or geared to be run striped down it will be OK. I'd avoid this and invest into something with 1G of ram or  a Fire. A kid/teenager  may not like this as I doubt it can run a game decently.\n\n...............\nThree weeks into the ownership, screen broke while it was in the case.  I can use it if i screen mirror (so using it to stream to a smart tv) now. really poor quality, don't think it will last a kid's use (abuse) as i was babying  this. Bought an Amazon Fire ($49 - 7\")... Its a lot faster and more durable (dropped it on the floor). You're better off with the Fire. Avoid this tablet !!!"}

But the few negative ones about battery life I got one that the battery drained very quickly after a overnight charge and letting sit for approx 4hrs with non-use my battery had already drained to 86%. That would have been my only negative point I guess. Contacted customer service and received a quick return and refund"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B015K3APWO", "review": "we had a nexus 7, my husband loved being able to do his web searches by speech instead of typing.  a few months ago an update from google seemed to set off major problems, tablet locked up time and again. hard starts and finally setting it back to factory default did nothing.  We tried several tablets and none worked well for him but this little inexpensive tablet worked like his first nexus- fast, responsive and works with speech recognition.  He loves it, I love that it is a 1/4 of the price of of 2013 model nexus 7.  Great little tablet."}

Trying to use chrome even with one tab was pretty much too much for it to handle. It was also really flaky and there was a lot of lag so you would end up clicking on the wrong option even if a button wasn't actually there at the time."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B015K3APWO", "review": "We have been using this tablet for our son to watch movies in the car. After the first couple of weeks it became very difficult to charge. It takes several hours just to go from say, 30% to 50%. and the battery life runs out very fast. We went with the cheaper version because its for a child, so we don't expect it to last for ever but still. It shouldn't take so long to charge it. With that said, the only other issue we have(which is a big one)is that it continuously drops wifi connection while he is at home streaming you tube for kids. Other than those two issues, it plays movies with decent resolution and doesn't lag like I have seen from other reviews. I hope this information helps other shoppers."}
